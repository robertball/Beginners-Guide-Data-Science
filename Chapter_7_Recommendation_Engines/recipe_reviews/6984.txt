FANTASTIC! I made this recipe 3 times before I really feel like I got it just right! Here are my discoveries: 1. I added just a dash of nutmeg and ground cloves. 2. I halved the recipe and made two 7 1/2" x 9" loaves, but the first time I used the temperature and time given in the recipe, resulting in two doughy (but delicious) uncooked loaves. If making two loaves, do 325 degrees for 1 hr 10 mins, they bake perfectly! 3. I can't really make the butter and sugar in the beginning "cream" together, there's just too much sugar, (but don't change the sugar amount!) So don't worry if it doesn't look creamy. 4. I used an electric mixer to mix the wet ingredients together, but I hand-mixed the flour into the mixture. Try #2 I used the electric mixer to incorporate the flour, the loaves turned out to be a bit too light and airy for me, like cake. Hand-mixing in the flour created a denser, more bread-like consistency. 5. Making a crumbly topping is a MUST. I took a topping recipe from Zucchini Bread IV from this site, but I modified it just a little bit for two loaves: ~ 1/2 cup packed brown sugar ~ 1/2 cup all-purpose flour ~ 2 or 3 tablespoons butter or margarine ~ 1 teaspoon cinnamon ~ 1/3 cup chopped walnuts or pecans. I microwaved the butter for just a while to make it nice and soft, mixed it  together with a fork until it was cumbly, and spooned it over the loaves before putting it in the oven. This bread is SO good and easy, even for a novice baker like myself!

The very best even with my lower fat changes! My changes not only cut the fat in half, but also cut the calories in each serving by 100. 
NOTE: I halved the recipe. My changes for half the recipe: 2 TBS butter & 1/4 cup of applesauce instead of all butter. In the batter I used 1 c Splenda and 1/2 c sugar. I used 1 c whole wheat flour and 1 1/4 c all purpose flour.  I used 2 eggs and light sour cream. My 2 loaves baked in an hour. No one would guess they are lower fat and calorie. They were perfect in taste and texture. Next time I'm going to try all Splenda and applesauce and will give an update on the results.

I cannot believe I'm the only one who had trouble with this recipe. The directions called for baking 1 hour at 300 degrees. (Which I questioned but followed.) Needless to say, my loaves were totally raw in the center! (even left them in for an additional 15 minutes. Truly disappointing. All 4 loaves went in the trash.

I have tried so many banana bread recipes, and this one is the best.  The only recommendation I would make is putting aluminum foil over the bread the last 20 minutes or so of baking to avoid having the top too dark... but I have to do this with most quick breads. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Just wanted to add this:  if you make this bread with FAT-FREE sour cream instead of the regular kind, it won't turn out the same! It is dry and crumbly... not as good as the first batch... I won't make this mistake again. (It tastes ok, but not as rich - so not too good.)

Yummy!  This is one of the absolutely best banana bread recipes I have ever tried!!!  I had some bananas that were overripe so I decided to make this for my family one morning for breakfast.  I made half of the recipe with 2 eggs and 4 extrmely overripe bananas.  The cinnamon sugar coating was a great touch and I also sprinkled it on top of the bread before baking.  While the bread was cooling, I went to take a shower.  When I got out, everyone was standing around the cooling rack waiting for me to say that it was okay to cut the loaf.:-)  Needless to say, it was well worth the wait.  One thing I did notice was that the loaves did not rise very much.  I know that my baking soda was fresh, so I'm not sure why the bread didn't rise.  I don't know if anyone else experienced this.  ***** just made this again this weekend.  Made half the recipe, and used a long and deep loaf pan (from which you can get slices the size of Starbucks breads). I used 4.5 ripe bananas, 1 cup of sugar, 2 tsp. of vanilla, didn't have sour cream, so I used about 6 ounces of nonfat yogurt, and lots of cinnamon and sugar on the bottom and top of the pan.  I also laid out a row of walnuts down the middle of the loaf pan before baking, and the presentation was very pretty.  I also had to bake it for about 15 minutes more than the time called for in the recipe.  The bread turned out yummy and not too sweet...perfect!!

This banana bread was so good!  It was very moist and, unlike other reviewers, it was not too sweet for me.  I got three 9x5 loaves out of it, and baked them at 325 degrees to make up for the added volume.  They came out just perfectly!

I love this recipe!  I am a banana bread fan, so it isn't hard to please me, but my mother and sister are definitely anti- banana bread.  Even they had to admit that "for banana bread, this is pretty good."  Another plus, this bread freezes wonderfully!  I left it in my freezer for a few months, and it was still moist and held together well when I thawed it. I will definitely make this again.

Like others, I did not want to use that much sugar.  I made 1/2 of the recipe and used 1 cup sugar + 2 eggs.  Turned out great.  Next time I may try 3/4 cup sugar.  Great for "mini loaves" to give as gifts.

Fantastic!  I had to half the recipe as I only had 2 small bananas on hand (used just one egg and a bit less sugar and flour).  I was worried it wouldn't turn out, but was not dissapointed one bit!  Tastes divine warmed up in the microwave with cool whip.

I modified a little:  Strudel on top and white/wheat flour split.  I'll make them completely whole wheat from now on, since I'm finding that whole wheat flour is virtually indistinguishable from regular white in this recipe.

I add a basic strudel on top:
1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/3 cup pecans
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2-3 tbls butter

I have tried these as large loaves, mini loaves, mini muffins (325 degrees for about 25-30 minutes) and extra-large muffins (325 degrees for about 45 minutes) and have had no problems.  Use the time as a guide, but it's not the time, it's the dough - you know it's done when you have can pull a clean toothpick/knife/fork... 

The most fantastic thing about banana bread is the ability to freeze bananas when they go past ripe and be able to actually USE them in something yummy.  I take bananas that are past the "my kids will eat them" stage and let them sit on the countertop until they go pretty close to black - you can let them get pretty heady.  Then I stick them in a ziplock and pop in the freezer.  When I have enough (6-7) then I pull them all out, let them defrost a little on the counter and then peel them while they are still fairly frozen (makes it MUCH easier to peel them when they are slightly frozen).

I've made this banana bread more times than I can count and it is excellent.  I freeze any over ripe bananas we have whole in their peel in a freezer bag until there's enough for this recipe.  (These are those leftover, spotty bananas that no one is going to eat, but you hate to throw away.)  If you try this expect the banana peel to turn black in the freezer, and be forewarned that the bananas are going to be mooshy from being frozen and may have some liquid inside from freezing and thawing.  Take the bananas out to thaw a bit before you're ready to bake.  When they're partially thawed just take the peel off and plop the banana and any liquid in a bowl and mash.  For those having trouble with the bake time, note that the recipe calls for 7x3 pans, which are smaller than standard size loaf pans.  If you are using larger, standard size loaf pans you will get 3 loaves from this recipe.  Bake at 300, but it will take more than an hour because the loaves are larger.  My large loaves usually take about 75 minutes.

This was delicious! Instead of making the mini-loaves, I was able to half the batter and make two 9 1/2 x 5 in. loaves. Don't worry, you might think that you are filling the pans up too high, but it works. Due to this change, I needed to increase the temp. to 325 and bake for about 10 minutes longer. I also highly suggest that you make the topping that is on the "Banana Crumb Muffins" recipe on this site (there are 2 recipes on this site, use the top-rated one with the picture). This made it 10 times better! The only other thing I did differently was using maple syrup in place of the vanilla. I realized I was out of vanilla extract as I was mixing the dough and researched substitutions online. This actually worked, though I'm not sure how it would work in other recipes such as cookies, etc.

Simply Wonderful!  A very tender crumb ... moist ... sweet ... delicious!
Since I had only 4 average size bananas, which made about 2 cups mashed, I added 1/2 cup softened butter, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp cinnamon. I used 2 and 1/2 cups flour, 1 tsp baking soda and 1/4 cup chopped walnuts.  I left out the salt to reduce the sodium, as I always do when baking anything but yeast bread.  I did add a dash of nutmeg, as my family likes this spice.  I also sprinked the top with the cinnamon sugar mixture.  I made one large 9x5 loaf and six muffins.  I baked the muffins for 18 minutes at 400 degrees.  When I took them out, I then reduced the oven to 325 degrees put in the loaf right away and baked the loaf for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  I enjoyed a muffin with a cup of tea while the bread was baking and filling the house with it's wonderful aroma. Thank you for the recipe.

This is really a great bread, but its very very sweet.  My kids and everyone that I gave to love it.  Every time I made this, I'll have to minus the sugar.  I've made this 3 times, and I finally got the sweetness right.  That is one and three quarter cups of sugar instead of the original 3 cups of sugar!!

I cut this recipe in half and used two eggs.  It came out moist, sweet and delicious.  I didn't bother dusting the pan with cinnamon and sugar because I spray it with Pam for baking.  I baked in a 9x5 in pan at 350 for a little over an hour.

Yummy nana-bread (as my little one would say)!

I read everyone's comments and did my own modification. I used 2 cups of white sugar and a 1/2 cup of brown, instead of the 3 cups white sugar called for. I also sprinkled some of the cinnamon and sugar mixture on top. My mini loaf pans were a bit smaller. They are about 6"x3" and I was able to fill 7 of them (I filled them 2/3 of the way). I set the oven to 300 and the loaves were ready in exactly 50 minutes -- I poked one with a knife and it came out clean. The bread was very moist with just the right amount of sweetness. Great recipe. I'll be making more for christmas gifts :)

This is THE banana bread recipe for my house. I love that it makes a good size amount and no one ever can guess it has sour cream in it, they just want my recipe! I was searching for a pumpkin bread recipe today and just wasn't happy with any of them that I found, so I came back to this recipe and substituted pumpkin for the banana and added pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon. VIOLA! Now I have THE pumpkin bread recipe for my house too! Very versatile!

Something went terribly terribly wrong. The batter tasted so amazing, but the bread was.... not. It was flat and dry - and took forever. 300 degrees for an hour left me with soggy, doughy lumps. I kept baking and kept baking and kept baking and finally just pulled them out and ate them.

This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever found and I have tried a lot.  I usually don't dust the pans with the cinnamon/sugar mixture because I can't tell the difference without it.  Otherwise, don't change a thing.  Best if made a day ahead--becomes moister. Freezes great!

The best!  I used this recipe to make 2 Bundt cakes.  They were incredibly moist and flavorful.  I used pecans instead of walnuts, but toffee chips or chocolate chips would be good too.  This will be my only banana bread recipe from now on!

I tried this recipe simply because I had bananas that were getting over ripe, and although I only used only four large ones, it had plenty of banana flavor. Overall the recipe was good, with rich flavor, and a very light hint of tang. But, I definately felt it was too sweet, and if I decide to make it again, I will reduce the sugar considerably, its just too much to dust the pans with sugar, and then add the large amount of sugar the recipe calls for. The slightly crunchy crust was wonderful and I wouldn't change that part of it. I Will consider making again, and reducing sugar.

This is the best banana bread recipe I've tried, ever! I did make some changes -- I substituted applesauce for 1/2 of the butter, used lowfat sour cream, and cut the sugar to ~1.5 cups (the applesauce & bananas sweeten this bread plenty). It turned out great -- like I just got it from Starbucks!

Also, this freezes really well, just wrap in Saran wrap & foil, and put in a ziploc bag. Perfect! **BY THE WAY: Until recently, I thought my oven and I were a disaster with quickbreads (pumpkin, banana, etc) -- then found that buying brand new baking soda and powder makes ALL THE DIFFERENCE (thanks, Mom). You should replace it every year at least (look at the expiration date) -- now you know, too!

I am wondering if I did something wrong on this recipe. I have never baked a banana bread at 300oF, always 350oF -- after the hour it was stil WET in the middle. Any suggestions. It sounds wonderful but it was very disappointing!

I wasn't blown away by this recipe (I was expecting to be from all the rave reviews). It was ok, but like many other banana breads I've made/tasted. Also, the recipe makes a LOT of loaves.....I would definately cut the recipe down (at least by 1/2) and up the cooking time (Mine took over 1 1/2 hours!)

This was most certainly an excellent and versatile banana bread recipe. I was rather skeptical about the sour cream at the beginning, but it made for a great balancer with the sweetness of the bread.

Personally, I did not need that many loaves of the bread (although the one I baked disappeared in about 10 minutes), so I decided to take the recipe and scale it to "8" (which would give me the batter for 1 loaf of bread versus 4). 

*PLEASE NOTE: the scaler of the recipe does not accommodate for the sour cream, so for my recipe making 1 loaf of bread, I only had to use 4 oz of sour cream, rather than the full 16 oz (one container). I also used light sour cream to scale back some calories from the servings. 

In addition, I added a little crust to the surface of the bread to make it slightly crunchy. Just sprinkle it on top of the batter once it is in the loaf pan. I based it off of the crust from the "Zucchini Bread IV" recipe, but modified for my portion size. 
For the one loaf, it goes as follows:
- 1/8 cup brown sugar
- 1/8 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/4 tablespoon butter
- 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
After about an hour, I'd also suggest melting a pat of butter and drizzling it on the top of the bread, just so the crust can glaze over just a bit.

Since I only had a 8.5" x 4.5" loaf pan available, I adjusted the cooking time to roughly 1 hour and 15 minutes (still at 300 degrees) and let the bread sit for 10 minutes before taking it out of the loaf pan.

This bread is delicious!!  I didn't have four 7X3 inch pans so I used two 9X5 inch pans and it worked fine.  I had to cook them about 20 minutes longer.  This is the best banana bread!

This is a very good banana bread.  And is extremely EASY to make.  When you first pull it out of the oven it doesnt have all the flavor and moistness until it sits for a few hours.  Let it cool a little, and wrap them in aluminum foil and the next day they will have all the flavor and be so moist they melt in your mouth!  UPDATE:  4/9/12  I make this bread all the time!  It is absolutely hands down my favorite banana bread.  I love it fresh out of the oven  smeared with a little butter and days after it is baked it gets even better! I do heavily dust my pans with cinnamon/sugar and also after putting the batter in, dust the tops of the batter as well, so that all sides have a nice sugar crust.  This is great with or without the nuts.  There really isn't anything that I would change in the recipe because it is excellent as written!  I am blown away by all the excellent and thousands of reviews this has now!  When I first made this several years ago it was in the 200-300 review range.  I am so glad to see so many are enjoying like I have!  Thanks for this winning recipe!

I also had trouble with this recipe.  I halved it and followed the measurements exactly.  It took 1 hr 20 minutes at 300 before I felt it was safe to remove from the oven and eat.  Although the toothpick came out clean, both loaves looked "gooey" on top and the texture was very spongy and as if they were not completely baked, even though I do believe they were cooked all the way through.  I double checked the ingredients and measurements and as far as I can tell, I prepared the bread exactly as described.  I was going to give one of the loaves to friends as a thank you for babysitting our daughter, but there is no way I could offer the bread to anyone.  They would probably think I was crazy for giving them raw looking bread and toss it in the trash - and rightfully so!  Sorry to write a negative review, but with so many banana bread recipes and having followed the directions as is, I do not want anyone else to spend time on this "5 star" recipe.

I was disappointed...it was too moist for me, believe it or not.  I gave two loaves to my church bakery sale, and my family ate the other two.  There was luke-warm response from my family and no feed-back from bakesale buyers.

How do I even begin to describe how wonderfully delicious this bread turned out? Everyone went wild for this bread! They've always looked forward to my baked goods but now, all they want is this bread. VERY moist, GOOD texture, EXCELLENT flavor. I, believe it or not, doubled the recipe as I had a lot of loaves to give away and used only 4 cups of sugar as the ripe bananas were naturally sweet. I ended up with 16 2 1/2" x 4 1/2" mini loaves and 3 9x5 loaves. The mini loaves are perfect for freezing as whenever you have a taste for banana bread, one little loaf is just enough to satisfy the craving. Thanks, Esther, for the recipe.

I have made this recipe dozens of times. I get raves
from all who sample it. The cinnamon sugar coating in 
baking pan adds a light coating to the loaf which makes 
it unique.
i finding myself buying extra banana so that i can 
accumulate enough. I freeze the ripe banana until i have
enough. 
i also freeze the baked bread which keeps very well.

oh my goodness. this is a banana bread for people who think they don't like banana bread. i made it with greek yogurt (an awesome and extremely healthy substitute for sour cream) and splenda, and you would never know it. I baked at 350 for 45 minutes and halved the recipe, and it came out just fine. can't wait to wow people with this one!

I would give this recipe more than 5 stars if I could! I consider myself a pretty good cook, especially when it comes to sweets, but I have never been able to make a good banana bread until this recipe came along. I prepared just as the recipe is written with no substitutions or additions, and it was perfect. Stayed moist for days.

the loaves are in the oven right now. The making of the recipe was easy enough. I added lots of walnuts and made sure that even the sides of the pans were dusted with cinnamon and sugar. Will update once they're done baking

**UPDATE
The loaves came out a little tough on the outside, but inside was ok. I wish the banana ingredient was indicated in cups or some definite measurement system because just saying 6 bananas does not cut it.  I was ok with the sweetness as it didn't come out scary sweet with all the sugar the recipe calls for.  The addition of walnuts was really great, I might add even more next time instead of just one cup.  Also my bf didn't like the sweetness much, so next batch will have less sugar.

Other than that, the bread was easy to make. The sugar on all sides came out nicely.

This was a great recipe.  The bread was delicious.  The sugar and cinnamon coats the outside and makes it a little crispy which gives the bread a great flavor.  I made as is with no changes.  Good to go.  Great for presents too.

This bread ROCKS!  Now, can I share with you my first attempt at this recipe?  Before making a new recipe, I try to make sure I have all ingredients.  (I don't like to stray the first time.)  I didn't check here because I was SURE we had everything.  But as soon as I started, I realized we didn't have enough butter.  I substituted a container of apple sauce we normally throw in my kids' lunch (abt 1/4 c.) for most of the butter.  When opened the sour cream container in the fridge, I saw that my wife had used most of it in some guacamole she made a couple nights ago.  What was left had goops of avacado in it because she stirred the guac and then double-dipped with the same spoon to get more sour cream.  I substituted vanilla flavored yogurt.  That also meant I didn't have to add vanilla, but probably O.D.'d the sugar content.  Moreover, I halved the recipe.  I forgot that fact when I added cinnamon, baking soda and salt -- another O.D.  Finally, when I went to add nuts, I couldn't find walnuts.  They were apparently eaten without being added to the last grocery list for replacement.  I added pecans instead.  It still turned out great.  None of these hassles were big problem, but I spent probably an extra half-hour in preparation time looking for the ingredients in the fridge/pantry.

Delicious! I halved the recipe because I could only find one loaf pan.  Used 2 eggs & a little less sugar.  I made one loaf & 6 muffins.  I had to cook the loaf longer than 1 hour.  This is a keeper!

Two words: Amazing. Recipe.
I have a couple fun things to do with it though.
1. Instead of using loaf pans, use muffin pans. It takes a couple batches for a twelve-muffin pan, around three or four. But trust me, IT IS AMAZING.
2. Instead of greasing the pan then sprinkling on the cinnamon-sugar mix, mix the butter with the sugar then add cinnamon. Grease the pans with this and create a lovely caramelized bottom and sides to the muffin.

This is a tasty, moist recipe. A tip for Bansreeparikh (and anyone else who found the loaves did not rise): the acidity of sour cream mixes with the baking soda, resulting in a reaction which releases gas. If you mix the baking soda into the batter very thoroughly before filling the loaf pans, this process will be done and the gaseous bubbles may be beaten out of the batter. If this happens, the eggs are the only remaining source of leavening for the bread, so it won't rise as much. Instead, I recommend adding the baking soda last and mixing it just enough to incorporate it. Don't beat the batter too much. Then when you fill the loaf pans, the chemical reaction will continue, causing bubbles which act as leavening. My loaves raised nicely using this method.

This is an awesome banana bread recipe! I halved the recipe (used 1 cup sugar and 2 eggs) and didn't have any sour cream, so used ricotta cheese w/ a T. of vinegar. The best banana bread I've ever made!! Thanks for the recipe!

This has definitely made it to the household favorite list.  Made two pans without nuts for the kids and it was gone in less than two days.  I put the walnuts in the other two pans and took them to work.  It got rave reviews at work, not even the crumbs were left.  I will definitely make this over and over again during the fall and winter seasons.

Yummmmmmmmmy!!  Used all the recommended ingredients but added more cinnamon sugar dusting to the top also before baking.  The cook temp is off.  300 degrees just didn't sound right so I upped the oven to 325 and it was done perfectly in an hour.  I only made two loaves so I halved the ingredients.  But as I sit here eating ANOTHER reheated piece with real butter on it, (diet tomorrow) I wish I had made 4 ;-). I forgot now who made the suggestion but it was a good one; covering the top of the bread with foil for the last 20 minutes.  I can't believe I have never thought of that before.  Good job!!

I was looking for a healthier banana bread recipe and loved this recipe but did cut sugar down to 2 cups and was plenty sweet. I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour/1/2 white and half low fat sour cream and half nonfat Greek yogurt. I made one large loaf-cooked for 80 minutes and a dozen muffins at 35 minutes and even had enough batter for 12 mini muffins at 20 minutes-thanks for a great recipe.

BE CAREFUL AND DO NOT OVER FILL YOUR PANS.  I did and it overflowed big time.  The bread is AWSOME, so moist.  Better if it sits a day or two.  I had to use some not so ripe bananas because that is all I could find so I substituted banana extract for the vanilla and the bread tasted great.  I also sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on top prior to baking and it made a great "crust".  Will make again. (and again and again....)

It was just too tempting to try a recipe with almost unanimous 5-star ratings.  My husband and I both agree that this is the best banana bread we've ever had.  I reduced the recipe to 12 servings, used a 9x5 pan, substituted fat free yogurt for the sour cream, and applesauce for the butter.  I used three bananas for the one pan, and offset the low-fat effect by adding 2/3 c chocolate chips and 1/3 c walnuts.  Wonderful!

If you like your banana bread to taste like a very sweet spice cake, you will like this recipe. This loaf tastes good, for a spice cake, which is what I would think I was eating if I did not know it was supposed to be a quickbread. My three criticisms are (1) that the banana flavor is obscured by the excessive amount of ground cinnamon, (2) that the texture is too soft and cake-like for a quickbread, and (3) that the large amount of sugar makes it overly sweet and, again, too cake-like. My family and I agreed that we prefer banana bread that is more banana-flavored, more toothsome, and slightly less sweet. I give it three stars because even though it is neither banana nor bread, it tastes good as a spice cake.

I have made this recipe several times so I wanted to pass on my mistakes.  

First, if you are like me and only have 9x5 bread pans this will make three loaves. 

Next, if you like the denser bread don't use a mixer, smash the bananas and hand mix.  If you like a fluffier bread mix everything.

Finally, one day I ran out of sour cream after 2 cups and used plain Greek yogurt for the other 2 cups and this still turned out awesome!

Hope this helps!!

The reason that some cooks are having trouble with the bake time and/or this bread coming out is that they are using pans that are too large. The recipe specifies 7 X 3 loaf pans--less than half the volume of a regular loaf pan. Try it again, this bread. is worth it.

Very moist and tasty bread - loved it.  I made the exact recipe (which should be a prerequisite for a review -- you shouldn't review a recipe unless you actually made the recipe!).  It occurred to me that the people that had trouble with the bread not being done may have used larger bananas, therefore more wet ingredients.  I found that 6 medium bananas made exactly three cups mashed, which I think is the right proportion for this recipe.  My only complaint is that the recipe is way more than four 3x7 pans' worth!  I increased to six 3x7 pans and still had a god-awful mess in my oven.  I'll use 7 or 8 small pans next time, or use larger loaf pans.  I'll also try substituting some whole wheat flour to be more healthy.  Thanks for sharing this delish recipe!

Made this last night exactly as described, sans the walnuts, including dusting the loaf pans. Doesn't everyone keep cinnamon sugar in the spice rack? It made a nice sticky glase on the bread. The smell of cinnamon filled the house and drove me crazy! I made three 5"x9" loaves which took about 1 hr 20 minutes to bake but they came out great. Took one into work this morning and it was gone by 9:00 am. People were asking for the recipe. We have tons of bananas in the yard this time of year and this is a great way to use them! Thanks for the recipe!

After seeing how highly rated this recipe is, I really wanted to make it.  However, I also wanted to cut the fat as some of the previous reviewers did.  I cut the recipe in half, and I followed the advice of one reviewer and substituted 2 tablespoons butter and 1/4 cup applesauce for the butter.  I was nervous to replace the sour cream with fat-free because I didn't want a dry and crumbly bread.  So, I used non-fat Greek yogurt because I thought the thickness of it would mimick sour cream.  I have to say that this bread came out very moist and delicious.  It received rave reviews from everyone who ate it.  Thank you to all the reviewers before me who gave such good advice.

I made this as the recipe and it turned out fine. I baked @ 300 and removed from the oven at 55 mins.  It was nicely browned and moist and tasty. I can never figure out why others complain that theirs were under cooked. They my  need to check their ovens with a thermometer.

Concerned about the baking instructions, I baked the loaves at 325 degrees for 1 hour and ten minutes and they were perfectly done.   I made a topping of ½ cup brown sugar, ½ cup flour, 1 Tablespoon Vietnamese cinnamon, and 3 Tablespoons cold butter cut into the other ingredients with a pastry blender.  The topping was an absolute necessity in my opinion.   My regular banana bread recipe calls for the addition of strongly brewed black coffee and I don’t think I realized how much that ingredient adds a wonderful complexity to the banana flavor until tasting this recipe.

This is a great recipe. I had to modify it a little because my fiance is diabetic, and it was the best batch of banana bread i have ever made. I used apple sauce instead of all the butter. Used whole wheat flour instead of all white flour. Used artificial sweetener for half the sugar. And i did add some chocolate chips along with the walnuts. I had to bake my two loafs for quite a while longer than the 1 hr. The  cinnamon and sugar mixture on the bottom was genius. It added a sweet crispy texture in contrast to the nice moist banana bread and was quite good. Overall, the best banana bread i have made.

I made this bread to give for xmas, it was a huge hit! My kids even loved it! It is not a traditional tasting banana bread so beware if that's what you're used to, this is more of a cake/bread/dessert. BUT AMAZING. Already have people asking for the recipe!

Wonderful Banana Bread.  Loved the idea of dusting the greased pan with cinnamon and sugar.  I sprinkled natural cane sugar (Sugar in the Raw) over the loaves before placing in the oven to bake.    This added a nice sugary crunch to the top.  Will make again.

I halved this recipie and used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I added about 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder because I thought it would help it rise as some people commented the bread was thick or fell.  I don't know if it made a difference but my bread turned out perfect.  I added 1/4 cup chocochips and 1/3 cup mix of pecans and walnuts.  I also followed a tip and added nutmeg and cooked both loaves at the same time 325F for 1 hr 10 min.    I also made a cream cheese frosting from this site and my BF loves it.  It's even better the next day!

used brown sugar instead of white, and used all fat free products (my friends are health conscious) and added 2 cups of chocolate chips! Yum :) I didn't enjoy it as much as most people, but that might be b/c I only like chocolatey desserts :)

My kids help me mash the bananas and after they tasted the batter they couldn't wait for it to finish baking. It was quick,and THE BEST banana bread I've ever made. I'll definitely be making them as gifts this year!

This banana bread is fantastic.  I am planning on giving it to friends and family for the holidays.  The sour cream adds a great moistness!  Yummy.

This IS a Winner! 
HONESTLY I think I have about 5 banana bread recipes saved and they are ALL going out the door...IT seems like its just not going to work when making BUT cook 300 for 1 hour and 20 min...that way everything is cooked through...I made 3 loaves one time, then halved the recipe another time and cooked for 1 hour 10 min and made muffins!
THEN started to layer it...little on the bottom, blueberries..then top it off....PERFECT!

I made a half batch and used two 9x5 in loaf pans.  300 degrees seemed a little low to me, so I upped the temperature to 350 for 60 minutes and they came out perfectly done.  I used 2 eggs, about 1/8 cup additional flour and half white sugar, half brown sugar.  Overall, I thought it was alright, but my husband (the big banana bread enthusiast of the family) didn't care for it much.  He prefers the Extreme Banana Nut Bread recipe also from allrecipes so I'll be going back to it next time.  There's really nothing wrong with this recipe and I would make it again if the rest of the family liked it better, but I think I'll have to find a different way to use up leftover sour cream.

I have tried about a dozen or so banana bread recipes and this is the best!  I half the recipe, add an additional banana, and make as directed.  I really think the sour cream makes this bread stand out.  I really like the sugar/cinnamon mixture on the pan too.

I received so many compliments from my coworkers over this banana bread.  I reduced the sugar by one cup (the over ripe bananas add sweetness naturally) and dust the pan with a brown sugar cinnamon mixture.  However, it required about an hour and twenty minutes to bake.  Great receipe.

It is an excellent tasting bread, there is no doubt,  BUT...  1 hour at 300 doesn't bake the bread to an appropriate "doneness".  I have baked this several times now, and have to increase the temp in the oven to 330 degrees and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes for them to be done.  Other than the change in baking time and temp, a wonderful tasting bread.

Absolutely wonderful, super moist.  I adjusted to 11 servings for 2 bananas baked in a 9x5 for 1 hour at 325.  Will never make another banana bread.

This is ridiculous.  I find I have to use more butter in order to cream the butter and sugar, but aside from that, this recipe is INSANELY GOOD.  You will be hard pressed to find a better banana bread recipe

I actually "discovered" this recipe a few years back on the internet; and at first I thought the same thing, just another banana bread recipe! But, this has to be the most wonderful banana bread I have every tasted.  I bake numerous loaves(mini and full sized) every holiday season for my family and gifts for coworkers - everyone adores this bread once they try it.  I use mini-chocolate chips in some instead of nuts; absolutely grand.  Thank you for a recipe that has become a family favorite.

This recipe was excellent!! Although the 4 loaves that the recipe was supposed to make made a whole bunch more!!  This recipe will make 12 5 11/16" X 3 1/4" X 2" loaves.  Only fill the pans half way, no matter what size you use.  There were no instructions on that, and being aperson who has never baked bread before I filled it to the top, only to find an ennormous mess in my oven.  Besides that pain, this was east to make and my husband loved it.  I took a few to work and gave a few to my friends, they want more!!  Also- I doubled up on the walnuts!!

This has got to be the best banana bread recipe we have ever tried. Even the batter smelled wonderful. The cinnamon sugur crust was a major hit with the kids! Took a loaf to work, it was gone before 9am with request to bring more!
If you love banana bread you must try this recipe!!

Amazing! I followed the recipe, but halfed it. I also only had one bread pan, so I put the rest in a cupcake tin, it made 9 of them. I dusted the sides of each cup and they were great. They only had to cook for about 30 minutes though. It was so yummy! I will only use this recipe!!!

This is a good recipe in my opinion.  Everyone enjoyed it.  It's a moist bread.  The spices were right on.  Unless I find a better recipe, I will use this for my family.  had a recipe I used for years and somehow it was misplaced.  This is a keeper.

Very moist and delicious.  I made 2 9x5 loafs.  One with chocolate chips, and one with a crumb topping as suggested by a previous reviewer.  Both were great.  I was hoping for more tang from the sour cream but nonetheless a great banana bread.

Really delicious!  I used 3 - 9x5 bread pans, baked at 325 for a little over an hour and they turned out perfectly.  Instead of walnuts, I opted for chocolate chips......seriously good stuff!!

I halved the recipe and made 12 muffins and only a small loaf (surprising).  I only used 1 cup sugar and think even that was too much, also I baked at 325 for 1 hour (bread only) and wished I had followed recipe.  Mine turned out too dry.

Really Good!! I made very small changes...I did not use the sugar/cinnamon mixture for a liner. Used 2 1/2 cups sugar in the mix and used "light" sour cream instead of full or no fat. I baked them in 3 regular sized bread pans. The timing thing others were having trouble with I fixed by baking at 325° for 1 hour. Absolutely perfect!

I've made this twice and its really good, even for high altitude baking!  The sour cream balances the banana flavor.  I've switched the flour out for whole wheat and it still works great.  Thanks for sharing!!

I followed the advice of another reviewer and baked my two loaves (I halved the recipe) at 325 for about an hour and they were perfect. The cinnamon/sugar coating gives them a slight crunch and delicious spicy undertone. I also added a 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the bread because it heightens the flavor of the cinnamon. This bread is super moist and has a perfect banana/spice flavor.

There's a reason why almost 75,700 people saved this recipe, it's fantastic!  Thank you Esther for an incredibly moist and delicious banana bread recipe.  I followed a combination of Esther's recipe and some of the reviewers' suggestions.  Here are the only two changes that I made:  1.  Baked at 350 degrees for 55 minutes (that's when my toothpicks came out clean).  2.  Used 1 1/2 c of white sugar and 1/2 c of brown sugar.  Between the very ripe bananas and the 2 c of sugars this banana bread had the perfect amount of sweetness.  Thank you again Esther.  Another great banana bread to try is the Banana Banana Bread.

I've made this bread twice now and didn't change a single thing except I used two large bread pans.  After years of looking for banana bread that wasn't dry, I have finally found it!  I will never make another banana bread, this one is perfect!

As a foods teacher, I have used numerous banana bread recipes, this is by far the best, so moist and flavorful. The outside coating makes it really different to save on fat and calories, I used 1 c. lite sour cream and 1 c. regular sour cream and poured into  threes 9 X 5 1/2 X 3 inch loaf pans. Will definitely make this again and encourage my students to make also.

Baked it this morning. The best ever!!!!!! The only thing I did different is halve the recipe. Cut the sugar down 1/4 cup and sprinkled the sugar cinnamon mixture on the inside on the pan and on the top of the loaf. Yummy!

Only had 4 bananas and 2 pans, so I cut the recipe down to 22 servings. Just right for 2 loaf pans. I had to cook it an extra 5 minutes.

Made is last night but into Muffins! Came out wonderful. I used nonfat sour cream, for the butter I used half butter and half applesauce. Then I coated all the muffin pans with the sugar/cinnamon mix and I made the crumble topping.  1/2 cup packed brown sugar ~ 1/2 cup all-purpose flour ~ 2 or 3 tablespoons butter or margarine ~ 1 teaspoon cinnamon ~ 1/3 cup chopped walnuts or pecans. I microwaved the butter for just a while to make it nice and soft, mixed it together with a fork until it was cumbly, and spooned 1 heaping teaspoon over each muffins before putting it in the oven. I made about 24 muffins.

I thought this lacked flavor and was a little dry for me. I wouldn't make again. I reviewed the recipe again and can't see anything I did wrong, guess it just isn't what I was looking for.

My friends loved this banana bread! I halfed the recipe and baked it in a 9x5" loaf pan for about 1 hour and 25 minutes.  I used the topping from Banana Crumb Muffins - 1/3 cup packed brown sugar, 2 tbsp flour, 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1 tbsp butter, cut together until it resembles coarse cornmeal.  The combination of this topping with the cinnamon sugar coating was delicious!

Excellent!  I used applesauce instead of butter, light sour cream and sprayed my pan with non-stick spray.  I was a little concerned that the bread would stick in the pan with the cinnamon-sugar coating but they didn't.  They came out beautiful and delicious!  
UPDATE:  The 2nd time I made this I replaced ALL of the butter and sour cream with plain fat-free yogurt -it was fabulous -moist & delicious!  A half recipe fills a bundt pan perfectly!

The best banana bread I've ever made. My boyfriend loved it and is making me take a loaf to his family! I only made two loaves and so I halved the recipe- yet I still used 4 bananas instead of 3 and I used two eggs rather than one and a half. It cooked for 1 hour and 10 minutes- so a bit longer than suggested. The result is PERFECT. Tons of banana flavor! A+!!!

Many banana breads are too dry, but this one was almost too moist!  Still, it is one of the best recipes I've tried (and I've tried MANY).  The sour cream gives the cake a luscious texture that really makes this bread stand out from the rest.
The only problem I had was converting the recipe to make fewer loaves.  The recipe does not convert easily, so I had to guess at the appropriate exchanges.  Thankfully, this is a forgiving recipe.

I had previously thought the "banana banana bread" was the best banana bread recipe on allrecipes. WRONG! This one is even more moist and more banana-y tasting. It's a *very* wet batter. I made it as written except I put it in 3 loaf pans rather than 4. Because of that I had a little extra cinnamon sugar mixture so I sprinkled that on all 3 loaves prior to baking. It took a full 2 hours to bake, but it came out delicious. It doesn't rise as much as other banana breads I've made, but I attribute that to the moist and dense texture. I kept one loaf out to eat and froze 2 loaves and when I defrosted them they were fantastic, too. This recipe is a keeper!

The directions to use four 7x3 inch loaf pans is way off base and left a huge mess in my oven.  I knew the pans were probably too full, but I'm a novice at banana bread so I just followed the directions.  I bet it will be good, but it's still cooking and the stuff that's falling to the bottom of the oven will probably set off the smoke alarm once my kids are asleep tonight.

Yummy, moist banana bread.  I reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups (plenty sweet), used 4 overly ripe bananas + 2 ready to eat bananas.  I sprayed loaf pans with cooking spray then sprinkled cinnamon/sugar from a shaker I already had with mixture.  I used 2 - 8 X 5 inch loaf pans and 2 - 5 3/4 x 3 inch mini loaf pans each filled about 3/4 full. I got nice, full sized loaves as does not raise too much.  I did bake at the 300* but did have to bake longer than recipe states.  The mini pans I removed at 1 hour 10 minutes and the full size pans at 1 hour 20 minutes.  Cooking time will vary on individual ovens so just keep an eye on it and use the toothpick in the middle should come out clean method to check for doneness.  Oh yes, I did add some walnuts. Again, very yummy.  Do try this recipe.

I made this once as it is written and it was fabulous - I just made it again today and had a few changes - I used 9 bananas that I needed to use up and I did not have any vanilla so I used almond extract.  This time it is exploding with banana flavor and the almond extract adds a nice change.  As another reviewer added I mixed the wet ingredients with a mixer and added dry by hand - I made two loaves and 12 reg muffins and 36 mini muffins and they are all wonderful and dense...and I baked at 350 and just watched carefully...the best banana bread recipe you will ever make!!!!

3.5 stars.  I rounded it up to 4 stars b/c I made some adjustments, and some other reviewer noted that it changed the texture of her bread.  Maybe it is the reason for mine's texture.  I just thought the flavor was so so.  I've been looking for the perfect banana bread recipe for some time, and this just isn't it.  I followed the directions except for the fact that I used fat free sour cream and made the recipe into muffins.  Though the result was by no means dry, it was not as moist as I'd like (could this be for the longer cooking time b/c of the lower temperature?)  The flavor was not all there either.  But my bananas were frozen...so I did not want to deduct points off for that.  I tried a crumb topping to add more flavor, but it only marginally helped.  I'm sure the ppl at my husbands work will eat these anyways.

Awesome!! If you prefer dense, moist banana bread to cakey versions, this is your recipe. Do yourself a favor and follow exactly as written before you alter. Bet you won't.

I have never had any banana bread as good as this one. Moist and so tasty.

Perfect recipe as is.
Of course the more experience you have, the easier it is to want and be able to change a recipe around.
I've made this as is and it was great.
I've also substituted 1C of sour cream with 1C of banana yogurt and added 1c of shredded coconut. I now make this in a bundt pan and sprinkling the bottom of the pan with cinnamon sugar for a slightly crisp top.

My entire family loves this recipe.  I often use whole wheat flour to make it healthier and I substitute about 1/2 apple sauce or apple butter and 1/2 butter or margarine instead of all butter.  I usually cut the recipe in third and make 1 loaf.  My kids like it with chocolate chips so I add those too.  I also like to do a little topping on it of brown sugar, white sugar, flour, cinnamon and butter.  If I don't have enough sour cream I sub all or 1/2 for vanilla fat free yogurt.  Sometimes I toss in a little bit of cloves or nutmeg for fun. Yummy and so moist.

O M G!!!!!!!!! THIS WAS THE MOST AMAZING THING I HAVE EVER TASTED!!! AT FIRST WHEN I SAW IT MADE 4 LOAVES I WAS LIKE THATS GONNA BE WAYY  MUCH BUT I CANT EXACTLY CUT IN EGG IN HALF SO I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE AWAY 2 LOAVES BUT I MADE THEM LIKE 14 HOURS AGO AND ONLY HALF OF 1 LOAF WAS LEFT. IT WAS A HUGE HIT EVERYONE LOVED IT. I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS 2 EVERYONE AND EVEN THOUGH I RATED IT 5 STARS I WISH I COULD RATE IT HIGHER. IT MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH AND IS DELICIOUS EVEN WITHOUT BUTTER! YUMMM!!!!!

What a great recipe!  The bread was VERY moist and the sour cream added a bit of tang to the bread.  I like this recipe because it was not too sweet.  I will definitely make this one again - Thanks! :)

This is my new banana bread recipe! I use it for both bread and muffins. It is so moist and the sugar and cinnamon on the bottom of the muffin pan gives it the finishing touch.  I do believe the sour cream is the secret ingredient to making this recipe so good!

I made these as jumbo muffins. Quartering the recipe made me 6 Big muffins. They are super moist and the crunch of the cinnamon sugar is really lovely. Other than subbing chocolate chips for walnuts I didn't change a thing and these will definitely be made again soon!

I love this recipe and the amount of bread it makes. The only thing I did differently was to add 2 teaspoons of lemon juice to keep the bananas from darkening and cooked them in cupcake tins.  I baked four dozen muffins @ 350 for 16 minutes.  I will freeze them and have them ready for on the go mornings for the kids.  Great recipe will make again and may add nutmeg.

Very yummy banana bread!  The recipe makes a huge batch and I love the idea of dusting the pans with cinnamon sugar.  I probably won't make it very often because I tend to use lower fat recipes, but this was a great addition to my holiday baking.

Received this recipe as a gift and it was delicious so I made a loaf myself and it's just a yummy! This is simple and very moist ...a keeper for me.  I also only wanted to try one loaf and changed the servings size to 10 so it would fit my 9x5 loaf pan and it was perfect.

I have made this recipe 4 times and I love it.  I followed some hints from others to really perfect it.  300 is to low in my opinion I baked at 325 for 1 hour and 15 minutes for the small loafs and about an hour and 30 minutes for the large size otherwise they turn out to doughy.  I also added a dash of nutmeg and liked how that turned out.  I also hand mixed the flour in to make the loaf a little denser.  Also adding a topping is awesome on this bread.  I tried it both ways and everytone liked the one with the topping more. For four loaves 1 cup of brown sugar, 1 cup flour, 6 tablespoons of butter(softened),2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 2/3 cup of chopped walnuts.  MIx together until crumbly and spoon over mixture before cooking. Awesome!

The best banana bread recipe I have ever tried!  And I have tried so many recipes - and they all seemed the same.  This bread was moist, but not heavy.  The sour cream made for great texture and flavor.  I also loved the addition of dusting the pans with cinnamon sugar.  Added a wonderful sweet crunch to the bread.  This is the recipe I will use for now on.

This banana bread TASTES really great, but the batter is so thick that it took a really long tome to bake up. Once it did finally get baked through, the "crust" was very crunchy. I think that the baking temperature needs raised to 350, that may help.

I have made this twice and love it, I have not used sour cream thou, but plain yogurt. I will have to make it one day with sour cream but until then I can say that this is great. I made up some in the mini loaf pans and am giving it as gifts this Christmas.

Ugh, even though I am obviously in the minority here, I did NOT like this recipe! WAAAAAY too sweet for my taste and for my family's taste. The only person who ate it was my 9 yr. old daughter, who would literally eat sugar straight up from the sugar bowl, if we would let her!

As good as Starbucks banana walnut loaf.  Next time I will use less cinnamon and will make smaller loaves.  This is definitely a keeper!

This is good and definitely moist.  However, it doesn't stand out over any other banana bread recipe I've ever made.

WOW.  This recipe is so easy and incredibly moist and tasty!  Anyone looking for a great banana nut bread, look no further.    The only thing I would change next time is that I wouldn't mash my bananas as much as I did so I get more of a texture variation between the bread, nuts and banana.

I have made this 2 times in 2 weeks since I discovered this recipe. I purposely don't eat the bananas I buy, just so I can have an excuse to make this bread. My husband said it was the best banana bread he has ever had. I used pumpkin pie spice, as I was out of cinnamon, and as I usually substitute PPS for cinnamon, and it was perfect. I made a 1/4 recipe, as I just have 1 loaf pan, and it worked perfect. I am going to give these out for Christmas.

I am not a banana bread person at all. But since I had some bananas in the fridge I went ahead and tried this recipe. I cut the recipe in half and modified the amount of ingredients called for: used 3/4 c of white sugar and 3/4 brown; added a dash of nutmeg and all spice; and no nuts used (personal preference). I had some leftover streusel mix (1/2 c flour, 4Tbs butter, 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon) so I used and drizzzled it on top.  Came out good and the bread alone is super moist. If I make banana bread again, I will only use this recipe.

seriously awesome!!! i had doubts of trying yet another banana bread but this is my keeper!! i halved the recipe and still got 2 decent sized loaves out of it. i did increase the eggs to 2 (instead of 1 1/2) and used 4 bananas. the taste is superb! all the sour cream i had on hand was smart balance and it turned out fine. i dusted my pans with flour and put a topping of brown sugar and cinnamon on top of loaves. i also had my oven at 325 and my small loaf was done after 55min and my larger loaf more like 65-70. and here it is 6hrs after making and one whole loaf has already been eaten!! choose this recipe it is awesome!!

I recently made the Creamy Banana Bread on this site which uses cream cheese and really liked it, but I think I liked this recipe even better. I halved the recipe, using 2 eggs and 4 ripe (though not overly ripe) bananas. I only had lite sour cream, so I used half the sour cream and half full-fat plain yogurt. Because I'm lazy, I didn't sprinkle cinnamon and sugar in the pan, just on top of the loaves before baking. I baked the two loaves at 325 for 42 minutes, and the bread was super creamy, light, and just sweet enough, delicious! My husband loved it as well. I think this is my go-to banana bread recipe from now on.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this bread! Very moist, and awesome warm with a little butter. I agree with some of the other reviewers, I cooked mine at 325 for an hour and 15 minutes, and put foil on for the last 15 to keep the top from burning. I also mixed some brown sugar and butter and spread that over the top during the last 15, so when I pulled it out it was all melted and gooey...YUM!

This is my favorite banana bread recipe thus far. Probably because this came out a lot like cake for me. I halved the recipe and baked it in a Bundt pan @325 for 1 hour and it was perfectly done. I did add a little canola oil (probably 2TB) to the batter before pouring it into my Bundt pan because it was too thick to pour at that point, and I wanted it looser without being wetter (otherwise I'd have added milk). I did not glaze it, but I think that would be appropriate, though not necessary to make it taste good (but necessary to make it taste WOW!). Thank you for the recipe!

Oh my goodness! Delicious! I halved the recipe and put the batter into a bundt pan, which turned out perfectly at the temp and time suggested. The only thing I didn't have on hand was the sour cream, so as per suggestions, I replaced with yogurt...only, I didn't have plain yogurt, so I went with what I did have: 3 oz. of vanilla yogurt and 3 oz. of strawberry yogurt. I think I'll make it that way every time from now on! I loved the hint of these added flavors. It tasted just as wonderfully as it smelled the hour it was baking. This is a keeper!

Best banana bread ever.  I added 1 cup of chocolate chips and about 1/4 cup of maraschino cherries that I quartered.  I also used pecans instead of walnuts.  I didn't use as much sugar ... only 2 cups and would probably try it next time with half the butter and some applesauce (one of the other reviews did it that way) to cut back on the fat and calories.

I loved this bread!  I halved the recipe and used 2 9X5 loaf pans.  I used plain yogurt because I didn't have enough sour cream.  The cinnamon/sugar dusting is key.  I made the bread at 9 pm last night.  By 9 am this morning there is only 1 loaf left ... and only 2 of us live here!

I read the five star reviews and got excited.  I read the one star reviews and got worried.  In the end, I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I took several suggestions from one star reviewers and increased the oven temp to 350 degF.  The bread was perfect in just 40 minutes in a convection style oven.  Very moist, very tasty.  The kids loved it and my church community loved it.    I put a basic vanilla glaze on one loaf and that was a big hit!

Best Banana Bread. Ever. My husband said it was the same caliber as his grandmother's (or better). I made some slight changes to lower the calories a bit (although it did not taste "healthy" at all, if you know what I mean). 1) I used 1/2 WW flour and 1/2 all purpose. 2) Used about 1 cup less sugar 3) 1/2 butter & 1/2 Margarine 4)More cinnamon than called for and 5) threw in choco chips/walnuts. AWESOME!

Here's a trick!  If you add the sour cream and the baking soda together and leave for 20 minutes till the sour cream rises, then fold it in - it makes it even more fluffy but just as moist....

this should be 350 degrees not 300.  I wondered if 300 was correct as most of the baking recipes I see are at 350.  The 1st timeI made this I put my oven at 300 degrees and the loaf did not get a rounded top, it was also kind of gooey.  The 2nd time and every time efter I use only 5 bananas and put the oven at 350. Much better!

This is a pretty good starter recipe, but it needs some more flavor!!  I halved this recipe since I only have 2 mini loaf pans.  After tasting the batter as written, I thought it was bland so I made some changes. 1) Melted the butter, then cooled it 2) Reduced sugar to 1 cup and substituded brown sugar for white sugar. 3)Added 1/2 cup cinnamon applesauce 4)Used 4 ripe bananas 5)Used 1 Tablespoon cinnamon and 1 Tablespoon pumpkin pie spice 6)Added 1 zuchinni, grated 7)Used walnuts 8)Mashed two of the bananas with a fork and set aside.  The other two bananas were whipped with the butter for a few minutes. (You want a light and fluffy banana cream)  Then I added the butter, eggs, vanilla, and applesauce.  In a seperate small bowl I combined all the dry ingredients and whisked them before I added them to the batter.  When you incorporate the dry mix, DO NOT OVER MIX!!!  Next, FOLD in the sour cream, the 2 mashed bananas, and nuts with a spatula.  Pour into well greased loaf pans. 9) Sprinkle top with a strussel topping consiting of 1/2 c. brown sugar, 3 TBS chilled butter, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 TBS flour. 10) Bake in a 320 degree oven for 63 minutes on the middle rack.  Cover with foil for the last 15 minutes of baking  There you go... it tastes a lot better with these changes!!!

I agree, this was like cake (good cake!) and I only used 2 of the 3 cups of sugar. It was plenty. Also we forgot to add the nuts to the batter so we put them on top with extra cinnamon-sugar...wow. My 4 pans were 6 by 2 inches, and then I had extra batter for a 8 by 3 inch pan. The 300 degree cook temp IS weird. It worked, but I had the smaller pans.  Next time 325!!!!

I made a half recipe and used it to fill an 8x8 pan - it was the perfect amount!  I also used FF sour cream and only 1 cup of sugar (for the half recipe), as suggested by others.  I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  Flavor of this bread was superb!  I also added 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips, and fiancee loved it.  However, he mentioned that with 1/2 cup walnuts added as well, the bread would be PERFECT!!  Will definitely add both next time!

I am amazed how I became an overnight baking sensation with this recipe :)  I brought two loaves to my husband's softball game, and the players asked me to bring more the next week.  I dropped off a loaf to my mother, for a luncheon she was having with friends, and everyone asked for the recipe.  I have shared this recipe at least 15 times, in the four times I have given the bread to friends/family.  I didn't change a thing, and it has worked perfect each time.  Once however, I did add some chocolate chips.  Thank you for submitting this!

The BEST Banana nut bread ever! I followed the recipe for the bread exactly but did add a crumb topping, it was good but this bread will be good with or without it. One tip, hand mix everything, it makes a difference in how dense your bread is and careful it makes a TON but I'm sure none will go to waste. I did one loaf pat at 325 for 45min and 2 pans of mini loaves at 325 for 20min each. They all came out perfect. I will never use another Banana Nut Bread recipe again!

All I can say is WOW!  I am NOT a Banana bread fan, but this is not your typical banana bread!   I did make changes as follows:  I halved the recipe as I had only 2 ripe bananas, so 1/4 cup butter, just under a full cup of sugar, and two eggs.  8 oz of 5% MF Sour cream.  As a treat, I added about 1/3 cup of Hershey's Special dark chocolate chips.  I did the crumble top that was mentioned in another review (butter, brown sugar, cinnamon and walnuts).  This made exactly two 4 x 7 loaves.  I baked at 325, and they were done in an hour.   They are PERFECT!  Not dense; not cakey, just right!   Try it; you'll really love it!

This banana bread is my family's favorite!  I sometimes make it with a topping using: 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 c  flour, 2-3 T butter, and 1 t cinnamon.  Just combine and lightly press into batter before baking.

Have to agree with the rest, absolutely fantastic recipe.  Here it is Day 2, and I still can't get enough of this still incredibly moist and flavorful banana bread!  Ms. Nelson hit a home run with this recipe, and is completely worthy of the 5 star rating on here!!  Way to go!!  Thank you for sharing the knowledge to make this sumptuous bread!  :)

Very delicious! I also upped the temperature to 325 degrees and cooked the 4 loaves for approx 1 hr 10 mins and they came out perfect! I added the brown sugar topping. It adds a very nice crunchy sweetness. Love it! The topping I used was 1 cup packed brown sugar, 1 cup all purpose flour, 6 tbsp soft butter, 2 tsp ground cinnamon and you can add nuts to taste, but I omitted the nuts. Just cream all of these together and spread over all 4 loaves. Enjoy!

I followed some of the tips offered by other users and came out with the best banana nut bread I have EVER had. First of all, I only had 4 mushy bananas so I halved the recipe but used 2 eggs.  I also added a dash of nutmeg and ground cloves.  Another tip I am so grateful for is the stand alone mixer vs. hand mixing.  I agree it is way too difficult to cream the sugar and butter so I did all of that bit in the stand alone mixer and then mixed in the flour by hand.  The texture was perfect.  Also for 2 loaves, 325 for 1 hour 10 mins was dead on the perfect time.  Thanks so much for the BEST banana bread you will ever sink your teeth into!!!

If you put 3 cups of sugar into any batter it will be the best batter you ever tasted.  This recipe was spot on.  Ingredients and instructions yielded 3 moist, tasty, lovely loaves of banana bread.

THIS IS SO GOOD!
 I *halved* the recipe, used only 1 cup sugar (next time I'll use even less), I also added an extra banana, and put pecans on top of one loaf before baking, instead of in the batter - that way they're crunchy. :) Next time I'll use only 1/4 cup butter because it was very moist and I don't think it needed that much. YUM!
(For me, this recipe is tied with Banana Crumb Muffins for 1st place. They're both SO yummy!!)

1/2d the recipe and had GREAT results. super moist yet light & delicious banana bread! here's what i did.

1. reduced sugar to 1 C white sugar and 1/4 C. brown sugar (for a HALVED recipe)

2. used two eggs.

3. hand mix dry and wet ingredients together until BARELY wet.

4. used 1/2 cup of walnuts, pecans would have worked great aswell.

5. would suggest using a crumb topping (regretting that i didn't right now)
6. in the oven at 325 degrees for about 65 minutes!

this was PERFECT for ONE 5x9 loaf. i was worried that it was going to overflow but it was just right! (and rised perfectly)

Super yummy, super moist - made as directed but halved the recipe.  I ended up putting in one large loaf pan & baked at 300 degrees for 75 minutes.  Came out perfect.  A winner !

Awesome recipe - perfect texture and flavor. The sour cream makes the difference. Impressed my mother-in-law and grandmother-in-law (who is an AMAZING cook). I halved the recipe and only used 3/4 cup of sugar (will probably try Splenda next time). I used a 1/2 cup of chopped pecans and added cloves just because I love them. I used brown sugar in the cinnamon dusting mixture, reserving about 1/3 of it. To that, I added about a T. of softened butter to make a crumble topping; sprinkled it on top and baked it in a large loaf pan (took about 80 min. to cook). The topping was nice and crunchy. Will definitely make this again!

I halved all of ingredients but used 3/4 cup sugar and 2 eggs.  I used a 9"x5" loaf pan and baked at 325F for 1 hour and 20 minutes.  It turned out perfect (as you can see in my posted picture :))!  Many of reviewers say this has too much sugar so I cut sugar a little bit but it was not sweet enough for me.  Maybe because I didn't put cinnamon-sugar dusting?!  But, over all I really liked it.  I was actually expecting more treat-like loaf, but it was breakfast-like loaf which is still good.

It should be labled "Banana All-the-fats-you-can-find Bread." It is good, but it needs a crunchy topping.
I don't know who had trouble with it rising, but mine overflowed two regular loaf pans AND 3 muffins! Nothing like the smell of burning batter on the heating element...

I have lots of single moms on my Christmas list. They have no time to bake between work, chores and children. For this reason, they really appreciate receiving a big basket of goodies at Christmas. It allows them to freeze and use throughout the year. In trying various Christmas breads on this site, I have found this entry to be one of the best breads ever.
For my presentation I will be making this recipe in mini-muffin or tart tins for a perfect individual serving size.
Thanks Esther. This is perfect!

Wonderful recipe. Everyone said it did melt in your mouth!
I like to make this and give some away. Recently my new neighbor said that it was the best banana bread he ever had. Oh, did I mention that he is a culinary chef? He wanted the recipe.  Thought this might be encouraging!

I made this for a banana bread competition and won first place. It did take longer than stated (around 1hr 20min) to bake. Baking at 300 is great though because it stays very moist. Took it out and put on a cooling rack afterwards and the sugar/cinnamon crust hardened into a nice crispy outer layer. Used pecans instead of walnuts.

This is the best banana bread of all the ones I've tried on this site.  Everyone loves this!  The sour cream makes the bread soooo moist.  I do add extra bananas and cinnamon, though, because it tatsed somewhat bland without the extras.

I also cut the sugar to two cups. Three just sounded too sweet, and it turned out just right for us. This was very good, but more of a cake than a bread. I used a 9x13 pan and baked for an hour. Worth trying for sure....

This was FANTASTIC.....I have never tasted banana bread this good and all of my holiday guests raved about it....it was moist and I couldn't put it down!  I will be making this again very soon!  The only thing I will say is that it takes longer than the stated "10 minutes" to prepare this and it takes about 1 hr. 25 minutes to bake at 300 degrees.  This will stay in my recipe box forever!

I've made multiple banana bread recipes from here and this one is my favorite- by far! I halved the recipe and got one loaf and five muffins. I baked them at 325, baked them for 45 minutes, took the muffins out, covered the bread with tinfoil, and baked the bread an additional 15 minutes and everything is *perfect*. I didn't measure my spices; I'm sure I added more cinnamon than called for and I added nutmeg. I'll be sticking with this recipe from now on- I'm so happy to have found a recipe that I love!

I have used the EBNB (extreme banana nut bread) recipe from this site for years but I tried something different this Mother's day and all I can say is "Wow!"  This is a far superior recipe for a much more moist bread.  Dusting the pans with cinnamon sugar made a delicious difference.  The only thing I did differently was that I used 2 cups brown sugar and 1 cup white as we prefer the taste of brown sugar in a banana bread.  Simply amazing!! I made 2 larger loaves (9×4?) and had to bake them at 325 for nearly an hour and a half but they could not have turned out better!

This is the best banana bread I've ever tried. However, there's no way  that amount of batter is going to fit into four 7x3 pans. I mixed it in a Kitchen-Aid mixer with a very large, very deep bowl, and the batter was over the top of the beater! I filled 6 7x3 pans and got lots of spillage (I anticipated this and put the small pans on a cookie sheet), probably could have filled at least 8.  Also, no way does this bake completely in one hour at 300 degs. After the first hour, I turned it up to 325 degs and gave it another 20 to 30 minutes. Eventually, I ended up with some salvageable loaves, and we even ate the free-form baked batter that went onto the cookie sheet. It was totally delicious, and worth trying again to find the right baking pans and temperature combination.

Very good! I cut the recipe in half and followed it with no other changes. It made two large loaves. The whole family loved it.

I love this recipe. In the past, I've had problems with banana bread not rising fully in the middle, despite being overly done in the remaining parts. I no longer have that problem with this bread. It has a good banana flavor, not too powerful, but not whimpy and lacking either. I consider this my new "go-to" recipe when it comes to banana bread. I simple strusel topping sends it over the edge too.

Very rich and moist. I halved the recipe and followed the recipe exactly except few minor changes: 1. Sprinkled white sugar only after greasing the pan (next time I will do cinnamon). 2. Cut down sugar to half (I just prefer not too sweet). 4. Used half vegetable oil and half applesauce (no butter). 3. 10 minutes before taking out of the oven I sprinkled brown sugar, cinnamon, and cocoa on top (all of them in generous amount!). Oh and using half the recipe, I used 2 eggs instead of 1.5 (too lazy to get 2TBSP out of 1 egg).
Now this one is quite important, I baked almost 1 hr and 15 minutes. (And I only used HALF of the recipe in ONE loaf pan, so timing may vary depending on the pan you use too.) Thank you for uploading this recipe. My family absolutely loved it! I will definitely make it again (as long as there are left over bananas around this house lol)

Easy recipe and great bread.  Everybody was impressed.  I added some toffee over the top and cut the sugar down to 2 cups though.

I halved the recipe and a substantial amount of the batter overflowed the 7x3 pans. The taste is very nice, though more like dessert than bread. I did bake it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for. It is worth making again but in larger pans and with an additional banana, less sugar, and perhaps some applesauce. With revisions, it is a delicious 5 star bread. We like the batter sprinkled with cinnamon and coarse turbinado sugar.

Oh My Goodness! And what goodness this is! I have been looking for years for a good recipe that is moist, and this one is a KEEPER!! I always keep cinnamon sugar in a shaker cup, so I didn't have to use the first two ingredients to make it. I made 2 regular loaf pans, and they came out perfect. The only thing I did differently was to shake some cinnamon sugar on top of the loaves before baking. My husband, who usually can take or leave banana bread, has changed his mind! He loves this recipe! Thank you!!

For a healthier twist, I used greek yogurt in place of sour cream, a little less sugar, a little more banana, and used whole wheat flour instead. Came out perfect! my new favorite banana bread.

Received endless compliments on this bread. The most moist banana bread I've had.

Followed other comments and placed in three 9 x 5 pans. I baked @ 325 degrees for about an hour and 15 mins.

I don't usually review recipes but I just have to comment on this one. Don't listen to any of the 'top reviews'; you don't need to change any of the directions or ingredient amounts for this bread! It's amazing as it is written! And it definitely DOESN'T NEED A TOPPING! Are you kidding me?!

I make this for a cafeteria (because everyone begs me to) and the recipe is very forgiving. I frequently quadruple the amounts (or more) and everything still comes out great. I don't even measure everything exactly, and it always works out fine. You can throw in a couple extra bananas, less flour, more baking soda, whatever, and it still turns out great. 

This banana bread is famous at the place I work and people get really excited when they see I have made it.

This was an amazing banana bread recipe. My family loved it and I think this is going to be my go-to recipe for banana bread! I didn't have any walnuts on hand, but the bread was still delicious. I look forward to trying it with the nuts next time. Thanks for a great recipe!

Oh no...yet another banana bread recipe.  I really wanted to love this especially because of the sour cream....but it rather disappointing. The only change I made was to halve the recipes. I'm giving it 3 stars only because I may have overworked the batter, which could have affected the texture. Two stars for flavour, of which there was little....and for the hype, of which there was waaaay too much. It was all right. I won't be using this recipe again.

I am not a banana bread fan but this turned out fantastic. I quartered the recipe to make 1 loaf - used 2 bananas lightly mashed, 1 egg and mini chocolate chips instead of nuts. Baked at 325 degrees for 1 hour and let it cool for 15 minutes. It was gone in 10 minutes with the help of my 4 and 11 year old sons. This is a keeper and I will probably make it again as soon as the bananas get too ripe.

So delicious!!! I added 1 tsp of Nutmeg, and took the advice of another reviewer for a topping. I took a 1/2 c. of brown sugar, 1/2 c. flour, and 2-3 Tablespoons of butter and mixed well. Then sprinkled mixture on batter before putting in oven. It is scrumptious!!

I used 2 cups whole wheat instead of all white flour.  I only had half the sour cream the recipe called for so I used vanilla Greek non-fat yogurt.  I had to cook the bread a bit longer until done in the center. It turned out very well. It was the best banana bread I have ever tasted.

Good but I have found better banana bread recipes using sour cream. A little dissapointed though because my daughter said it was dry and couldn't really taste the bananas as much....very unusual because thats a whole lot of bananas compared to the banana bread recipes I have used. Although, I do like the sugar/cinnamon outer crust.

Ok this bread is to die for! It almost got several less stars when I checked it at an hour it was completely RAW and cold. I saw another reviewer said the same thing....I refused to give up on it and turned the temp to 325 and cooked an extra 18 minutes. PERFECT! I used SaraLady19's advice and added the crumb topping (1/2 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup flour and 2 tbl butter) over the top before baking and it kept it from getting too dark. Instead of walnuts I added 1 cup of chocolate chips...SOO moist sooo delicious!!

I would have given 5 stars had this been called Banana Sour Cream Cake. It is far too rich (not to mention calories) to be called a bread. As promised it is indeed moist, maybe too much so as it tended to stick to my pans (all 4 of them). Then again, maybe that's because the recipe called for the pan to be buttered and my pans are Teflon coated. In any case, I think the combination of buttering the pan with the sugar/cinnamon layer created the sticking problem.

Also, because this called for 4 pans and I noted only 1 cup of walnuts, I opted to split the batter in half. To the first half I added the full 1 cup of walnuts and to the 2nd half, I added a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. (One of my guests is allergic to nuts).

The flavor was quite good, particularly the one with the chocolate.

Made this recipe many times and I make the following changes:  I use only whole wheat flour, 2 1/2 cups of Splenda (no sugar), and use unsweetened applesauce instead of butter.  I've tried it with the lite cream cheese but prefer with regular.  Always get rave reviews when I bring a loaf somewhere.

This is an incredible recipe! I added the crumbly topping, as suggested by the most popular review; otherwise, left the original recipe as it was written. It was very moist and yummy! This is a keeper, for sure!! Thank you for sharing.

This is my go-to Banana nut bread recipe. Not too moist, and packed with favor! One time I was short on white sugar, so I subbed dark brown sugar for about half the amount... now I do it that way on purpose.

I'm not sure if the misfire on this bread happened when I scaled it back (4 loaves? Too much!) or if it's just the way the bread is. The banana flavor really wasn't what I was expecting here. The bread was certainly moist, almost like a cake, but the flavor wasn't so great. Think I'll switch back to my old recipe after this one.

Very moist, halved the recipe & made muffins. Didn't have sour cream so uses 1/2 cup crushed pineapple with juice. Not as much banana flavor as I wanted maybe the sour cream brings it out more? Also used all whole wheat flour maybe it was that. Still very good will def make again!

Absolutely delisious!  I made banana muffins.  I sprinkled the cinnamon/sugar mixture on top of the muffins before baking.  For 24 muffins (1/2 of this recipe), I baked for 35 minutes.  Muffins are so moist!

Followed the recipe, except baked at 325 for 1 hour 15, and added 1/2 cup more nuts.

The loaves didn't rise!!  I was going to give the recipe 3 stars until I remembered that I sprayed the pans with Pam, thinking I needed something to keep the sugar cinnamon mixture on the sides of the pan when I dusted them.  What was I thinking! Big mistake!

I cut the flattened pieces into cubes and took them to work. and they were gone in minutes.  They still tasted good!

I discovered halfway through making this that my sour cream was 4 months out of date, so I improvised with whole milk and vinegar instead, using 11 oz total, instead of the 16 oz of sour cream. Turned out fine!

Some people like their banana bread firm throughout, and with a softer crust, but others like it like this recipe, more of a coffee cake texture. It turned out with a lovely crunchy outer coating and very tender inside. More of a bananas foster flavor than the traditional banana bread, but I'm in love.

I did have to increase the time of cooking, but it wasn't much. If you don't know basic rules of baking, such as sticking in a knife or toothpick to test how done it is, then you fail at life.

WOW YUMMY!!!!! was looking for a different banana bread then my usual and thought this one(with sour cream instead of milk and oil) would be great and I was not disappointed. I didn't add cinnamon and used maple extract and its so yummy! I got one large loaf and 12 large square muffins. I will make this again but I will reduce the sugar as I find it really sweet. I also think that using maple extract added an extra yum to it. Thank you for sharing this great recipe.....Oh I forgot to mention, I baked everything at 350, muffins for about 30 min and the loaf was 75 min.

I don't know if it is the altitude difference here, but I baked at 350 for 1 1/2 hours.  Regardless, I love sweets, so I was happy with all the sugar :)  I did not have any sour cream, so I substituted strawberry yogurt and it seemed to work great.  Also, I only had one egg, but the egg shortage didn't seem to hurt.  I am actually pretty happy with my strawberry banana bread!

Loved it. halved the recipe due to the # of overly ripe bananas on hand. Didn't even use walnuts (didn't have any). Fantastic. Best banana bread I've made. Thx, Esther.

This is now my signature treat I make for guests when they stay in our home. I send them off with a loaf as well. My son is OBSESSED with banana bread as a result of this recipe. Let me tell you too, I tried SEVERAL other recipes until I finally resorted to this one. Who would have guessed? This tastes just like the moist, gooey banana bread I remember growing up on. I do it EXACTLY like the recipe says on this one & it comes out perfectly every time. I even tried a buttermilk recipe- dry. Thank you for this wonderful recipe, you've inspired me to bake!

This bread was wonderful! It's such a great recipe. The bread came out super moist and full of rich banana flavor. I did halve the recipe and made two 8x3 inch delicious loaves. I used 1 over ripe banana and 2 regular ones since I didn't have enough. I don't believe it affected the flavor too much. I also used only 1 cup of sugar, since I don't really like super sweet bread. The baking time is spot on, 1 hour was the perfect timing for my bread. This banana bread recipe is definitely one that I will use again!

unbelievably good recipe! hats off! this is my first time baking banana bread & 3rd time baking from scratch but i felt like an oven genius! i just used 4cups of flour & 7 large bananas to prevent a very "thick bread" & compact the flavor. adding sugar & cinnamon at the bottom is plain genius. thank you for sharing! :>

This was absolutely the best banana bread I've ever eaten! The only problem I had was that it took quite a bit longer than an hour. Think I'll bake at 350 next time.

This was my first time making banana bread and these were delicious. I decided to use cupcake trays instead since I have no bread pans and after 30min they were perfect. The sour cream added the perfect touch.

I'm a novice baker, and this came out perfectly. The sour cream really does make the difference. I used a fat free sour cream and still found this was delicious - full fat would only be so much better I guess!

I've made this so many times, I almost have it memorized.  The people I work with BEG me to bring it in.  One girl I work with said, "Girl!  You put your foot in it!!"  haha.. that's a good thing.  The ONLY change I make is 1.5 cups white sugar, 1.5 cups brown sugar.  This is my most favorite recipe on the site!!!

I have made these twice now. The first time was great, the second time was even better. I made 3 loaves the first time, gave one to my father in law who loved it. He asked me to make it for his birthday which I did last night. I did make a few changes the second time. I didn't use the full coating ingredients. The first time I had more than half left over. I used 2 tablespoons of white sugar and 1/2 teas cinnamon, sprinkled over greased pans and still had leftover. I added 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and 1 cup packed brown sugar. I used 7 very ripe bananas instead of 6. I didn't have enough sour cream so I used 8 ounces of sour cream and 8 ounces of Greek style yogurt. I added 2 1/2 teas of vanilla. I also toasted the pecans at 175 C degrees for 10 minutes before chopping. I added a 1/2 teas of nutmeg as well. I used a 9x9" round pan and baked it for 1 hour and 45 mins at 160 C degrees. It also made one extra loaf which baked perfect at 160 C for 1 hour and 25 mins. I have a smaller oven and takes a bit longer to cook. It turned out perfect, not to sweet, moist, soft and melts in your mouth. The crust topping makes it that much better, if possible. The crunchy topping and soft middle is the perfect match. I've never had banana bread this good. This is the one and only banana bread recipe for me. Thank you so much for this recipe.

This is a great recipe!!! I only had 5 bananas and I substituted splenda for the sugar. I added a topping that consisted of 1/2 c flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, a couple teaspoons of cinnamon and a half stick of butter (softened). Delish!!! Highly recommend!!!

I baked it at 325 for an hour in an 8x8 and 9x4 (?). Just moved and had to improvise. :o) both turned out beautifully!

This was the best Banana Bread I have ever made and my husband "actually" loved it!  It didn't get completely done in 1 hour. I was afraid it would burn so I turned the heat down to 300 degrees and let it bake another 15 minutes...it came out great. No one in my family likes Walnuts so I used Pecans.  I toasted them first in a pan on the stove and just as they were finished I added a tablespoon of sugar and 2 pinches of salt then a teaspoon of butter and it put a very nice glaze on the nuts...then I added it to the batter.  We really loved this recipe and will defiantly bake it again!

Wow! I would actually give it 4 1/2 stars. I think that it needs a little more spice. I will try a little more cinnamon and maybe some nutmeg next time. Will definitely make again!

I normally make Banana Nut and Ginger Bread but didn't have a dark beer on hand so I made this instead.  I thought it had a great flavor and enjoyed the sugar dusting on the pan, but I'm still partial to the other recipe.  I changed the temp to 350 and cooked for just over an hour.

Absolutely wonderful.  Cut recipe in half, used 2 eggs, put in 2 loaf pans at 325 for 55 min, perfectly done.  Slabbed a hunk of butter on it and yummo!

This banana bread is wonderful!!  Make sure you springke the pan with the cinnamon/sugar mixture.  This addsa nice little crunch to the outside edges.  I baked mine in three loaf pans for 1 hr 10 min. on 300'. Like another reviewer, I also mixed up 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 3 Tbs. butter and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts.  I sprinkled all of this on top prior to baking.  WOW!!!  Best banana bread I have EVER had.  My husband isn't a big banana bread fan, but he ranted and raved about this one.  PS. I covered the tops of the loaves with an aluminum tent for the final 20 minutes to prevent the tops from browning too much.

This was a very easy recipe which makes it a keeper for me. I found the bread had a good crumb and a decent banana flavor. I halved the ecipe as I only had three bananas and didn't need four loaves anyway. I got lazy in the half-recipe and used two eggs instead of using a one and a half-egg, I just added about two tbsps more flour. I also used plain greek yogurt in place of the sour cream - it's what I had on hand. I used a glass loaf pan for one and a disposable aluminum tin for the other, then precisely measured the batter in half between the two pans to see how the time came out (since there is quite a lot of issues mentioned). The glass pan loaf was done in 70 minutes (it was probably passable at 60, but I thought it needed that tiny bit extra). The aluminum tin was still visually batter-y between the cracks at 70 minutes - it needed 30 minutes more for a total of 100 minutes baked at 300 degrees. I covered both loaves with foil at the 50-minute mark to control the dark top.

I make this all the time. Love it! I omit walnuts personal preference, and it took me a couple of times before I realized I needed to cut bananas to 4 instead of 6; it just wouldn't bake properly, no matter how long it went over on time. 4 is perfect and it cooks evenly. Thank you!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I don't even like bananna bread and can't wait for this to come out of the oven.  My fav way is toasted with butter.  Thanks.  I followed the recipe with no changes 5 times now, all perfect.  It took about 10 minutes longer to finish baking.  I didn't raise the temperature and I won't for the next batch either,  I think that is what gives it the great texture.

So moist and delicious! I made these into muffins. Be warned. If you want to make these into muffins make sure you don't have to be at work in an hour and a half. It makes a lot of batter and you can make lots of muffins with it. Perfect for a treat for the co-workers which is where I'm getting ready to take them to.

This recipe was very good! I was experimenting since I only had one banana, and I didn't want to throw it away so I cut the recipe into 1/4. I baked this in two little porcelain souffle dishes. The first one I left plain, and the second one I added chocolate chips to. Both tasted delicious!

I must say...this is a great recipe.  Very good indeed.  I made it for 16 Servings which is half of the ingredients and it turned out great.  If my colleagues are nice I just might bake another one and bring it to the office.

followed recipe and a few other hints in the other reviews. I have to say I wasn't that impressed. I mean it was ok, but nothing to write home about. second round, i cut back a bit on the flour, but still just so plain...not bad just plain...lol Just my two cents.

Perfect if you have a sweet tooth.  The texture and flavor are awesome but I found them a bit too sweet.  They bake perfectly and give you a nice moist bread texture given you use the correct size pans (7" X 3").

This was my sons cake for his first birthday! lol It is really good! I sprinkle brown sugar on top, like the carmalization it gives. My girlfriend jokes that I have to always make her some whenever we meet up  At the time I only had on loaf pan so I stored it in the fridge overnight and it turned out great

Long time user, first time reviewer.  This bread is amazing!  The sour cream and fresh bananas make all the difference.  First attempt were made as loaves of bread.  Second attempt in muffin tins - just as yummy!

Fantastic.  The whole family loved it.  I put it all in a large cake pan instead of 4 loaf pans, and it turned out great anyway.

This is by far THE best banana bread I've ever made/eaten! I made the recipe exactly as statet. I only had 2 bananas so I made 10 servings on the recipe page and hit the calculate button and follwed the recipe as stated. I used a "standard" meatloaf/bread glass loaf dish but had to bake it for 1 hour and 25 minutes. It turned out PERFECT! This recipe is definitely a keeper. Everyone raved that it was the best banana bread they'd ever had! CORRECTION- I just realized I altered the serving size for the recipe I made but still added the full 16 oz.of sour cream! LOL Maybe this is the secret to my amazing-tasting fatty banana bread success! It tastes SO good I think if I ever make the full recipe I'll add more sour cream than recommended ;)

This bread is delicious and so moist. Just the right amount of sweetness and the walnuts make it extra nice. Great recipe! As a side note, I've made this twice now and the second time I did not dust the pans with cinnamon-sugar. I didn't think the extra sugar was necessary so I used a paper pan liner instead and it was fine.

Good, easy and lots of loaves to share!  I was short 1 banana which I feel made mine a bit drier (USE ALL 6!!), and I also left out the walnuts because I have a picky eater trying these. They definitely need a little something, nut, chocolate bit, something.... I will definitely make these again with 6 bananas and some chocolate chips. Yummers!

Awesome!  I made it just as it is except I baked 2 at a time and baked them at 325 for 70 minutes and they are perfect!!  My hubby took a loaf to work and the whole thing was gone by lunchtime.

1)I forgot to add baking soda and it turned into a gelatin like chewy bar, disgusting, will try again

2) i tried to only make one loaf, but didn't want ot waste the egg by adding 3/4 an egg, so i used an urber small egg, its still too moist...
failed #2, gonna try it without the sour cream

GREAT! Very dense, moist and delicious.  Temperature MUST go to 325 degrees and cooking time should be increased to 1 1/2 hours. Easy on greasing the pan when using the cinnamon and sugar for dusting.  I started with the foil baking loaf pans...never too early to start Christmas baking!

Very good banana bread, I cut it down to 1/4 the original recipe and it was the perfect amount for 3 people for a couple of days.  Next time I'll have to try adding some chocolate.

This is absolutely great! I halved the recipe and made muffins. Kids loved them! I baked them at 325 for about 27 min. This is definitely a recipe I recommend you try. A great banana bread flavor. Not overpowering, not too sweet. Just right.

Really good - very moist.  The sugar and cinnamon alomst form a crust around the bread.  It makes a huge batch though.  I followed the recipe and it made 12 muffins and 2 loaves....

This was great. My family loved it. I made it as stated however next time i might cut back on the sugar just a tad since i thought it was just a bit too sweet. Thanks for the recipe.

Before trying this, I read all the "negative" comments, suggestions and changes people made. Accordingly,  I just made this recipe with these changes:  I set the oven at 325; I used only 2 1/2 cups of sugar; I used light sour cream;  I filled only 3 regular (9x5) loaf pans only half-full plus one smaller foil pan. I just tasted a small slice: a very moist, sweet banana bread (more like cake).  Although I tested each with a toothpick which did come out clean, I probably will leave it in a bit over an hour next time.  I added chocolate chips to one loaf and found that the very bottom of that one could have done with one or two minutes more of baking.  All in all, a most delicious banana bread to add to my collection. As with most quickbreads, probably best to save slicing for after one or two days of ripening.

this is an awesome recipe. It was just the right amount of sweet and soooo moist.  The touch of cinnamon and sugar on the pan gave it a nice little sweetness to every bite. Everyone loved it!!

I have found my forever banana bread recipe!  It was so moist!  I did use plain yogurt in place of the sour cream to make it a bit healthier and it turned out fabulous!

This was excellent. I bake in a counter top convection oven, so I scaled the recipe to 21 servings (2 eggs; yield: 3 mini-loaves), adjusted the temperature to 275 F. and the cooking time to 40 minutes. I used these settings for the first 2 mini-loaves. For the third mini-loaf, I changed the cooking time to 35 minutes. I covered all of the loaves with an aluminum foil "tent" during the last 15 minutes of baking time. Other "tweaks" included: (1) I used 2 cups all-purpose flour and 1 cup whole wheat (healthier); (2) I used 1 cup Splenda (fewer calories) and 1/2 cup brown sugar; (3) I used the full 1/2 cup of butter but I also added 1/4 cup unsweetened (homemade) applesauce for additional moisture. The results? My 2 adult sons finished (a better word might be "devoured") one of the loaves before I had a chance to wrap the second loaf and even before the third loaf had finished baking (LOL). They topped it with Cream Cheese and "washed it down" with milk. I will be making this again.

Great banana bread. We followed it pretty much to the letter, but made only two big loaves (so upped the temperature to 325F and baked 1 hour and 10 minuts) Was lovely!

I inherited a wonderful banana bread recipe from my grandmother when she passed away. I was practically brought up on that stuff. The smell of banana bread in the air always makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. So, I was surfing around on here looking for different recipes for dinner and such. I came across this sour cream version, and I thought I would give it a shot.  First off, this recipe is phenomenal! It has a great texture, it’s very moist, and also has a wonderful taste. It was very easy to make. Since there are only two people to my household, I divided the recipe by a fourth to accommodate only 8 servings (which equals one loaf). I also took into an account that the written instructions of the recipe are for the 32 servings (four loaves). So, I made the necessary changes to the written recipe format (1 tablespoon of sugar & ¼ ground tsp of cinnamon for dusting the pan. Also, ¾ cups of white sugar go into the mixture).  As for dusting the pan, I didn’t use the full amount that was called for. I took a little bit in the palm of my hand, and just lightly sprinkled it on the greased pan.  I placed the finished mixture in a Stoneware Loaf Pan and cooked it at 300 degrees for about an hour. It was delicious!

Wow, so moist and flavorful! I cooked it at 325 for 40 minutes, then covered it with foil for the last 10-15 minutes (new house, new oven, new and very humid climate). So delicious!! Thank you for sharing!

I subbed Splenda for the sugar and non-fat yogurt for the sour cream... came out really great. Very light and moist. Thanks for a banana bread recipe that's not the same old thing. I'll definitely make this one again!

Delicious. My husband loved this and it is a great way to use up "too ripe" bananas. I halved the recipe and added a toping... ~ 1/2 cup packed brown sugar ~ 1/2 cup all-purpose flour ~ 2 or 3 tablespoons butter or margarine ~ 1 teaspoon cinnamon. put the topping on before putting it in the oven. delicious!

This is absolutely the best banana bread recipe I have every made.  My kids never really liked my banana bread because it was too dry.  This is so moist I can't keep it longer than one day.  If I want to save it, I have to freeze it (out of sight out of mind).  One of the reviews said not to use fat-free sour cream.  I use it always and it turns out fine so maybe she had something else going on that day with it.  Not really knowing what six bananas would be (as they are all different in size), I started off using 2 cups and then 3 cups and then 4 cups and found that 4 cups makes more of a "loaf" of banana bread.  At 3 cups it was flat.  Thanks so much for the delicious recipe.  I threw out all my other banana bread recipes as I will never make any other kind of banana bread.

FABULOUS! I made it as written, but added brown sugar crumb topping suggested by SaraLady19, which covered 4 8" loaf pans perfectly. I cooked them at 325 for one hour.  My husband absolutely loved it. I took slices over to my parents, and my dad said "next time bring over a loaf on Sunday morning with coffee!"  This recipe tops all other banana bread recipes I've tried on this site, some were good, some better than good, but this one is perfection! I hope all enjoy it as much as we do.

I made this today. I was short 1 banana and only had 1 cup of sour cream but it was still great. I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of allspice. My hubby and daughter loved it. My daughter said it was the best banana bread I ever made. This one is a keeper.

I was expecting this recipe to be incredible and instead it is a very moist but abnoxiously sweet bread. The sour cream just makes the 3 cups of sugar taste like 2 and a half, it adds no flavor of its own. Also, baking time should be adjusted to 1:15 at 325 degrees.

I made the recipe & baked it in a cupcake form @ 250* for about 2-3 hours.  They still turned out raw looking in the middle. I think it's because of all the banana's & sour cream. I will not make this recipe again. The taste is good, but the look is raw looking.

The bread was so delicious!  I did make few modifications- I cut the recipe in half and baked in a 8x8 square pan.  I used 2 eggs, 3/4 cup sour cream (all I had on hand), a pinch of nutmeg, 1/2 cup chocolate chips (& walnuts), 2 cups whole wheat flour, left everything else the same, and baked at 300 for an hour.  After an hour, it was obvious that the temp needed to be higher, so I raised it to 350 and baked about 30 more mins.

It was so moist and the crust was just a tiny bit crunchy.  My boyfriend and I couldn't stop eating it!  Even with the 100% whole wheat flour, the texture was great, almost like it was made with white flour!  I will definitely make again!

I made several changes to suit my family's tastes:  Instead of sour cream I used non-fat plain yogurt, instead of oil I used unsweetened applesauce, omitted the nuts and I thoroughly mashed the bananas.  I would also like to mention that this recipe freezes well; I made a triple batch and froze two thirds of the batter which is just as good after freezing!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This bread turned out great!  I halved the number of servings and baked it in a bundt cake pan, because I don't have any 7x3 pans.  That worked perfectly.  All it needed was a little extra time in the oven.  I sprinkled the sugar mixture in the middle of the cake to make a filling, which was really yummy.  This bread is't fragile or too heavy like some banana breads and toasted very easily.

I didn't like the banana or banana with blueberries. SO I substitued pumpkin about 1.5 to 2 cups and the bread was amazing. I halved everything (16 servings). I chged measurements to 2 tsp cinn., 1 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 c brown sugar, 8 oz sour cream, 2/4 white sugar, 2 eggs, 2 tsp vanilla, 2 eggs, 2 1/4 c flour. I baked it for 1 hour at 300deg. I make this bread every wk and people asked me for the recipe. Sometimes I put the sour cream in or not..still good. Definitely 5 stars.

As other reviewers have said, the baking times are a bit off.  Also, I substitute some brown sugar for the white, which may be the reason for that(?).  The batter makes much more than I thought, and the cooking time takes longer than stated-maybe 1 1/2 hrs, but TOTALLY WORTH IT!!

I give myself a pat on the back for very few things, one of them being my baking and cooking capabilities(almost to a point of arrogance!).  I sell my baked goodies at work and this, along with "moms zucchini bread", have given me a new regular!  She wants 2 loaves of each every week!  One to share with others at work and the rest for her and her son.  Everyone at work raves about it!  Thank you for this recipe!!

I've not actually made this yet, but my mom has and I wanted to add her comments, so I don't forget(she LOVES this recipe):

Pan size is not regular loaf pan size but smaller. If you make full recipe this will make 3 loaves. If you half this recipe use 2 eggs. I've made with or without nuts and used pecans rather than walnuts. With this list of ingredients how couldn't it be great! (Mom)

I made muffins with this bread instead of loaves.  The recipe was very moist and my husband loved it. The sour cream definitely adds a creamier consistency. I generally think fat free sour cream tastes gross but I couldn't taste the difference when adding it to this recipe. My usual banana bread turns out more golden so I broiled the tops of the muffins for 2-3 minutes.  Yum!

WOW! my first banana bread ever, was really good! I didnt have cinnamon for some reason so I used pumpkin pie spice (which includes cin,nutmeg and a few others) wherever it said to put cinnamon in. Very delicious. Cooked all 4 loaves at 325 for 75 minutes, added the brown sugar and butter(and more pumpkin pie spice) to the top to make the crust. simply wonderful.

Very easy to make with EXCELLENT results. I halved the recipe (using 2 eggs) and used 1 standard loaf tin. I had to increase the cook time by 20 minutes.

When I first tasted this, I thought it was very good.  Then I tasted some banana bread that I had been given that was probably made from a mix and I realized that this recipe isn't just good, it's outstanding!  Will be trying as muffins soon.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe, its delicious. And so easy to make too. The first time I made it I discovered I didn't have quite enough sour cream so I substituted it with the same amount of cream cheese instead and it worked perfectly. I warm the cream cheese in the microwave on a low setting before mixing it in to the butter, sugar etc. I've made this recipe about 4 times already and have used sour cream half the time and cream cheese the other and haven't been able to tell a difference in the wonderful flavour and soft texture. Thanks for a great recipe! :-)

I halved the recipe and then made 1 loaf and 12 muffins.  I put chocolate chunks on top of the muffins before baking.  They came out great; very moist and flavorful.

Wonderful! Thanks for making me a baker LOL. My 9 yr old neice and I made this bread scaled down to make two loaves and it is a family hit. I don't even like bananas but this is the most tasty moist delicious bread. Again thanks for making me a baker.....

Unbelievably good!  I'm now going through my recipe collection and discarding all other banana bread recipes because NOTHING compares to this!  The bread is moist, flavorful and incredibly delicious.  I made 8 gift-giving size loaves (in 3-by-5-inch pans) out of one recipe.  I also used small, garden-size bananas off our banana trees and found that 22 very small bananas did the trick.  I made this bread exactly according to the recipe and cannot possibly improve on it.  Definitely a keeper!

Great taste and texture :-) I made a half recipe and made muffins instead of loaves. A half recipe made 12 large muffins and 12 mini muffins. I baked them at 350 degrees for 30 minutes (a few minutes less for the mini muffins). I used a bit less sugar than the recipe calls for, and skipped the sugar/cinnamon mixture. I also used fresh blueberries instead of walnuts.

Will definitely make this recipe again :-)

Wonderful! I made one huge loaf, which took longer to cook.  I accidentally cooked it too long, but it was still moist. Thanks! *** Update:  I now halve this recipe for one big loaf, but I think I will invest in smaller loaf pans, maybe that's the trick to making this work best. I do not dust the pan with sugar & cinnamon, because it gets stuck to the pan. Also, the last time I made this I didn't have enough sour cream, so I used part vanilla yogurt. It was awesome!

I cut this recipe in half and used a mini muffin pan. I also used half oil and half applesauce. For some reason, the tops of the muffins never browned (although the sides were fine). They tasted pretty good the first day, but the appearance was off-putting... they looked uncooked. My young son was not thrilled, and he's usually a fan of muffins.

I adjusted this recipe to make 1 loaf in a 9x5 loaf pan = Yield 8 servings. On the conversion for me it says 3 cups of sugar. I halfed this to 1 1/2 cup sugar. This was the only change I made. It turned out absolutely perfect! Any more sugar and it would have been far too much for me. To compensate I dusted the loaf pan a little bit heavier than what the recipe called for. I used 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. FH loved it! It was my first try at baking from scratch in 10 years, so I am very impressed with how easy and yummy it turned out. I will be making this again for sure! Thanks for the recipe!

Best Banana bread that I have made!  My husband, mother in law and 1 year old son loved it!  I cut the recipe in half (using 2 eggs) and made 12 muffins (only baked the muffins for ~25min) and one bread loaf... They both turned out great! I will definately make these again when I have overly ripe bananas! They were quick and easy to prepare!

I made this for Sunday morning breakfast for my husband and myself and I am embarrassed to say that an entire loaf was finished by Monday morning!  It is the best banana bread recipe that I have ever made.  The sour cream made it super moist.  I DID make a few changes, though--no nuts, used two 9x4 loaf pans instead of four 7x3 (made two large loaves) and I omitted the cinnamon in the batter (I am a banana purist, what can I say).  Next time I will probably try the cinnamon in the batter, as per my husband's request!  I also baked them at 350, as other bakers have mentioned here.  The loaves turned out great--this one is definitely a keeper!

I just made this bread and HAD to come rate it.  Oh...my...god.  I had a banagasm...it was so delicious!  

I halved the recipie because I didn't have enough bananas and used reduced fat sour cream.  It STILL was amazing.  This will be the recipe I will use from now on.  Thanks for sharing!!!

This is absolutely the most delicious, easiest banana bread recipe I've ever had to pleasure to taste!
Execellent. I made some in small loaves, wrapped them in those little Christmas cellophane bags, tied them with curleycue ribbon on the end, and off they went. Everyone loved how they looked and especially how they tasted.
This is the best! Thankyou!

This recipe was OUTSTANDING! Best banana bread I've ever had, and sooo moist! I only used 2.5 C sugar, and used just a light dusting of the combo on the bottom. Turned out great! Will make again and again. Thanks for the great recipe!!

WOW! These are spectacular! I don't like banana bread but I had a ton of ripe bananas that I had to use and I came across this recipe and saw that it had sour cream (also had some to use up) and figured that I don't like it anyway so why not try it. Well, I LOVE this recipe. I make some into muffins so my three year old has an eaisier time eatting them and put the rest into a loaf pan. I just can't say enough how good these are. Thank you for a GOOD banana bread recipe!

This is a nice twist of an old favorite.  I added a bag of chocolate chips at the end of the recipe.  I made 3 loaves and a dozen muffins.  The muffins cooked in about 45 minutes, and two of the loaves were ready when my hour timer went off.  One of the loaves, filled a little more than the others had to cook a little longer.  

If you make this, make sure you are not opening your oven to check on the breads.  This may affect the cooking temp.  I like the cinnamon flavor that comes thru, especially on the bottom of the bread/muffins.  I will make this again!

This us the BEST bread ever! I always get rave reviews from friends when I stop by and drop off some of this yummy bread! The cinnamon sugar "crust" make it terrific, and the sour cream keeps it moist for days!(If it even lasts that long!)

Very moist and easy to make.  I also had to bake longer than an hour, probably close to an 1 1/2 hours. 

I do agree with Pink's review that the bread does taste better after letting it set for a few hours.  I made mine yesterday and it tastes even better today.

The texture is cake like, not as dense as some banana bread.  The next time I make this recipe I'm going to make into cupcakes and top with cream cheese frosting.

So yummy! I only had 4 bananas so I added 1/2 cup apple sauce and 1/2 tsp banana extract. I also added 1/4 tsp ginger and ground cloves. After reading the review where the loaves didnt rise I mixed some or the dry ingredients together first before adding them to the sugar/butter mixture. I'm not a baker so I dont know if that made a difference, but the loaves were beatuiful.  We arent big on nuts so I omitted those as well. The loaves baked up nicely in 3 5X9 pans. I will definitely be making this again and again. Thanks!!

This recipe is FABULOUS!  It made 3 nice size 5x9 loaves.  Would be even better with toasted pecans or even some mini chocolate chips.  I think I'll cut back on the sugar a bit next time-it is a very sweet bread.

NOTE: I poured the batter too thick in the first two 4x8 dishes and it never cooked the middle of the bread, so a lot was wasted.  Pour absolutely no more than 3 inches thick in a 4x8 glass loaf dish.  EXCELLENT RECIPE.

Just wonderful!  I made a half recipe and baked it in 8 mini loaf pans for friends and a 2x6 loaf pan for my boyfriend's grandparents.  I scarfed down a mini loaf in 2 seconds flat, so I'm making a full-size recipe today.  I only had one problem - some of the sides of the mini loaves stuck to the pans because the cinnamon-sugar coating melted into a sticky syrup that defeated the purpose of the greased pan.  So, this time I'm only going to but the cinnamon-sugar coating on the top of the loaves.  In conclusion, this banana bread is the tastiest, most moist stuff I've ever tried!  :)

A few months ago I had a piece of banana bread at a small coffe shop that was wonderful.  For months I have been trying to duplicate the moistness and density of that bread.  I have found it and much more with this recipe! I made it exactly as It calls for. Perfect.  I am so pleased at how moist the bread is.  The cinn./sugar caoting is a sweet and playful touch, much needed for someone who doesn't care much for the "end" slices. Please keep in mind that the kind of pans you use, the temp. of the ingredients, quality of ingredients and accuracy of oven temp. (as well as other things)all play a role in how well this recipe bakes up.  If a dense and moist banana bread is for you do not give up on this recipe if it doesn't come out right; take a look at some of the things mentioned.  This banana bread is fabulous. Myself, and my husband (who is very picky and critical about his food,have plowed through all four loaves in the past four days! The only thing I would suggest is to maybe add banana extract to batter if you like an intense banana flavor( as another review mentioned).  But keep in mind this is a sour cream banana bread, the "sour cream" coming first. Thank you Esther!!!!

Yummy!!! I ended up making two large loaves and sprinkled a little extra cinnamon and sugar on the top.   I also found it was yummy warm, BUT it got even better the next day after I had wrapped it up and let it sit.   It  just melts in your mouth and the cinnamon and sugar makes the crust my favorite part (unlike other recipes where it is usually dry).

this recipe was extremely moist & east to make. I added the nuts and chocolate chips for something extra. I made mini banana muffins for my 3year old son & he couldn't get enough of them! I would definately make this again!

This bread is absolutely AWESOME! I made only half the recipe and still had 2 nice size loaves.  I brought one to work and it was gone quickly.  Everyone liked the cinnamon/sugar on the sides. I sprinkled some on top before baking and some more when I took it out of the oven.  Will definitely make this again!

Absolutely delicious, moist, flavorful bread.  Big hit with family.  One suggestion: four loaves from one batch of batter is too much.  Loaves come out too small.  Try 2 or 3.  You won't be sorry...freezes great, too!  A+

This was my first attempt at banana bread. I made it with my 4 year old niece and she had a blast. The recipe didn't say how much to fill the loaf pans though. I filled them 3\4 full and ended up with banana bread all over my oven. Next time I'll fill them 1/2 full instead. It still turned out really good though.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!!!  I halved the recipe and baked ALL the batter in a 9x5 loaf pan.  I baked it at 350 degrees for 1 hour.  I took the advice of a previous review and loosely  covered the loaf with foil during the last 25 minutes of baking to prevent the top from becoming too brown.  No gooey center as most of my other attempts in years past!!!!!  Definitely a keeper!!!!  The sour cream seems to be the secret ingredient in this banana bread in the same way that mayonnaise is the secret ingredient in my cake recipes!!!!!!

Amazingly good recipe! The trick to this one is to beat the butter, eggs, sour cream & sugar on high with a hand mixer before adding everything else. The loaves fluff up perfectly like a cake and then settle down after cooling off just like a good nut bread should. The ONLY two things I did different, was use HALF the sugar because good, ripe bananas add sweetness, too. Everyone far & wide that got to have some LOVED the bread and were none the wiser that I used less sugar!! And secondly, I cooked at 325* for 45 minutes before turning oven up to 350* to finish them off for the final 30 minutes of baking (1hour & 15 min total). The toothpick test came out clean then. If the loaves start to brown too much on top, cover with a piece of foil and they'll be fine.

Totally amazing! So moist and delicious. I only have one bread pan so I quartered the recipe, which led to me having to use like one whole egg rather than 3/4 egg. Not a problem to round up. I also baked at 325 for an hour and covered the pan with foil during the last 20 mins of baking. The loaf came out completely uniform in color except swirls of spice and banana wonderful-ness. I also left out the nuts because I don't like them. The cinnamon sugar on the outside was such a hit. Best banana bread, hands down.

Hands down the best banana bread I've ever made!  I didn't have enough sour cream so I substituted half plain greek yogurt and half sour cream.  Scaled it down to 3/4 and made in two 9x5 loaf pans.  Cooked at 325 for an hour and ten minutes.  Don't overcook this - I took it out when my knife had moist crumbs attached but not batter.  Even better the second day!

I get great feedback whenever I make this, but I make a few changes.  1). I do not sprinkle the cinnamon and sugar into the baking pan(s) because I find the taste to be overpowering.  The cinnamon in the bread is a nice subtle flavour which always surprises people who try it and think it's great.  Covering the bread in it is simply overpowering.  2). I halve the recipe and that will make a single loaf in a standard size loaf pan.  When halving I recommend using 2 medium bananas and 1 egg (forget about the half). Bake at 350 for around 45 minutes and it comes out perfect.  3).  I like to sprinkle some quick oats and brown sugar on the top before baking.  Gives it a nice rustic look.

Great! Better than plain banana bread! Cinnamon, vanilla and "sour cream," make it so delicious.  Very moist!! I had to substitute sour cream for half yogurt and half cottage cottage-cheese since I did not have sour cream.  I also used a 9X13  pan and ended up raising the heat to 325 degrees since it was not baking at 300 degrees.  Baked for 15 minutes additional minutes.  I also halved the sugar since I am pre-diabetic.  I am not those annoying people that make changes just used what i had on hand!

I halved the recipe, using 2 eggs instead of 1.5, poured into 2 pans and baked for one hour at 325. Perfect! Not sure if it made a difference but I added a bit more vanilla and some clove and nutmeg.

Was probably the best banana bread I've ever had.  Every time I passed by it seemed like there was slice missing, needless to say it didn't last long! I didn't have 4 loaf pans so I just made the entire recipe in a bundt pan,turned out great!  Thanks, great recipe!

Very moist and a definite keeper.  My family recipe always seemed to come out dry when I made it.  This one is perfect.  I like adding some cinnamon sugar to the bottom and top to give it a nice crust.  A perfect recipe to experiment with or leave alone although I did only use 2 1/2 c of sugar and it was plenty.  I've also added a dash of nutmeg to the bottom of the loaf pan and the top - delicious!

Also can add 1/8 tsp. nutmeg & cloves and use Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream. :)

Followed Saralady19's advice for making 2 loaves. Turn down the oven temp & hand mixing the dry ingredients . So moist everyone loves it. Gave it to the teachers & all 5 asked for the recipe & said hands down best bread. I added lots of halved walnuts & raisins

This is the recipe you are looking for. It's hands down the best banana bread you'll ever make. Everyone loves banana bread, but if you want one that stands out as the best everyone's had, this is it. I have a million other things to be doing right now, but just made a loaf for the hundredth time and decided to review it because it's that great. I don't always have sour cream, so that's the one thing that is tricky, and I also don't always have 6 ripe bananas, either! I have found that halving the recipe is fine (sometimes using 2 of the 3 orig. eggs). As for the raw center others speak of, use your judgment. If it looks raw, let it go a couple more minutes. This one doesn't dry out quickly like others-- it's really moist, rich and just the right amount of sweet. Sometimes I add whatever chopped nuts I have on hand to the top, and I always finish the top with a sprinkle of cinn/sugar. I have frozen the loaves as the recipe description suggests and they come out literally as good as a fresh loaf. But the only way that extra loaf will make it to the freezer is if no one else is around :) Seriously, this is a keeper.

The texture of the bread was light and springy and coating the pans with the cinnamon/sugar mixture gave the outside a wonderful brown sugary taste.  Half the recipe calls for 1.5 eggs so I used 1 egg and then a flax/egg substitute (1T ground flax + 3T water) for the 0.5 egg as it is much easier for me to use half of the flax than trying to use half of an egg.  The flax also adds a slight nuttiness to the bread which was nice because I was out of walnuts!  My two 9x5 loaves were done in exactly 1hr at 300 degrees so no trouble there, but I am only giving this 3 stars because the banana overpowered by the cinnamon.  I will use this recipe as a base and add more banana because everything else about the recipe is spot-on.

I was looking for a banana bread recipe at the request of my fiance due to his starbucks B-bread addiction LoL I ten found this recipe.. Hands down the BEST banana bread ever! I made it to the tee, just might've added a bit more cinnamon LoL I also added the walnuts over the bread batter just before putting it in the oven so that they baked onto the top and looked pretty when sliced. I saw that some people were cutting sugar and using lowfat ingredients... well. if you're on a diet, I don't recommend eating this bread period LoL it just doesn't taste the same! My family loved it! They ate every last crumb and are begging for more! It's very moist and ohhh so good!!!

Good stuff! I only had 1 cup of sour cream (instead of 2) - so I added yoghurt (actually... Yop!) and it still came out nice and moist.  I decreased the amount of sugar to 2 1/4 cup - and it's sweet enough for me - just make sure your bananas are really ripe.  One review said that she/he had trouble with baking at 300 degrees for 1 hour.  Yes, I had the same experience.... at one hour it's still raw in the middle... however, just leave it longer in the oven until the toothpick comes out clear.   Mine were done in 1.5 hr.

I have made this recipe in a loaf pan, muffin pans and mini muffin pans. We adored the muffins. 
One dozen muffins is the same volume as one loaf pan and they cook in only 30 minutes. The minis cook in 20 minutes. 
No matter which way you prepare this recipe it will turn out great. 
I don't think a few chocolate chips would hurt either!

This is my go-to banana bread recipe!  I use brown sugar in the batter instead of white sugar and cut it down to 2 cups.  In addition to dusting the bread pans with the cinnamon-white sugar mixture, I also sprinkle some on top of the batter before baking.  This gives it a light crispness on top and is my fiance's favorite feature of this banana bread!  Thanks for the recipe!

If I could give 10 stars!!!
This is by far the best Banana Bread recipe I have ever made. The only changes I made were: 2 more tsps of vanilla, and fat free sour cream. Yum Yum

I made this today with my extremely overripe bananas.  I halved the recipe, and made the following changes- used 1/2 ripe avocado instead of butter, 1 C sugar, 2 eggs, separated and beaten before adding, 3/4 c greek plain yogurt, half wheat/half white flour, added extra cinnamon and I had to put in chocolate chips for my daughter.  I also did sugar and cinnamon the outside....I brought a loaf to my husband at work...he texted me- Nothing but....Y U M M Y....and he usually DOES NOT enjoy most of my somewhat healthier version of baked goods....he has no idea I used avocado either...nor do the kids!!  GREAT RECIPE

I had to bake for 1 hour and 30 minutes though as it was still raw in the middle after an hour, but it was fantastic! I love how moist it came out.

I always thought my mom made the best banana bread on earth. This recipe is almost exactly the same as hers but just a bit better. I love using the cinnamon and sugar to line the pan. Definitely the BEST banana bread.

Best banana bread I've ever had, Granma! (17 yr old granddaughter said that & I agree.)  Left out nuts becuz grandkids don't like them & I thot I wouldn't like it at all becuz the nuts r usually what makes it good (my opinion).  Not this time.  Has 2 b becuz it calls 4 more bananas than usual AND the sour cream.  Sooo moist & delicious & flavorful! Definite SAVE!

This a such a great recipe!  Big hit every time I bake it.  It is a go to recipe for pot lucks and parties.  I know some of you have had trouble with baking time/temp.  My current oven takes about 20 min longer than it calls for at 300.  What I do is keep a close eye on it after an hour checking in the middle until my toothpick comes out clean.  DONT change the temperature. Keep it at 300.  Tried to up it to 350 and came out dry!

Made exactly as it is listed.  My bread pans are 10x5 and it was done baking on 300 degress at 50 minutes.  I was a little leary taking it out at that point due to so many needing to bake longer than an hour, but it came out absolutely perfect!  This is the most delicious banana nut bread I've ever had.  Not too moist and not dry.  Just perfect!

This is very tasty and quick and eash to prepare.  I substituted yogurt for the sour cream and added white chocolate instead of walnuts.  My only gripe is that it made more batter than would fit in the pans.  I tried to "make" it fit and they overflowed when they rose.  Should have followed my intuition and put the rest of the batter in a mini loaf pan.

I don't know who needs 4 loaves so I halved the recipe and used a 9x5 loaf pan (a shallower pan would've been better). I left out sugar recipe for bottom of pan. I don't think its necessary

2 eggs
3 bananas (thats all i had)
3/4 cup of sugar (cut back on the sugar because of other reviewers, but it needs more!!! I'd say 1 cup to 1-1/4) 
8oz of sour cream
1tsp of vanilla
1tsp ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon of salt
1-3/4 baking soda
2-1/2 cups of flour
1/3 cup 1tbsp and tsp butter (awkward i know)
no walnuts, so i used 3/4 cup of raw halved pecans

300 degrees 1 hour (because of the pan I used I think I ended up baking for about an hour and a half. I would recommend upping the heat to 325-350, especially for a deeper loaf pan.)

This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever made. All my other recipes for this are going in the trash. I did have to bake them for 1 hr. 15 minutes though. Make sure you dust the pan with the sugar mixture because it makes it extra yummy.

I have been trying out banana bread recipes for years since we always seem to have ripe bananas on hand.  I have to say...this is the best banana recipe I've made.  It's moist, light, and has great flavor.  Even my mom requested my recipe! :)

This recipe isn't better than the one I normally use, but it's really good. I wanted to try it with the sour cream and it turned out wonderfully. I halved the recipe (used 2 eggs), and used 1 C whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 C white flour. It is very moist. I have some more ripe bananas so I may just make a couple more loaves for in the freezer.

Awesome! So moist. I think the bundt pans cook more evenly. Very close to time mentioned. You do end up with extra batter than just 1 bundt pan. I may up the recipe to get 2 bundt pans full. Easy to cut in half and fit in a gallon sack tol freeze or give away.

AMAZING. The BEST banana bread I have ever had. Everyone who eats it asks for the recipe! I'm even making it in lieu of a birthday cake. It is THAT good. I use a half cup less sugar than the recipe calls for.

My banana bread didn't have much flavor too it. I think I should of added more cinnamon and vanilla extract. I also had to keep it in the oven for an extra 20 minutes. Still tasty tho!

This was awesome!! I made this per the recipe with no changes (I did however forget to put the cinnamon and sugar mix on the bottom of the loaf pans but otherwise I followed to a T). The loaves turned out very moist with a great flavor. I got many raves over this and plan to make again. Would give 10 stars if I could.

I made changes only because I didn't have everything on hand but the reason I want to rate it as is because it is helpful to read reviews. I used 2 ripe bananas and 3 very ripe peeled barlett pears. I used 16 oz ricotta for the sour cream everything else the same. I made 2 loaves and 6 muffins instead of 4 loaves. I forgot to sprinkle the cinnamon on the sides of the loaves so I put it on the top.Excellent recipe even with the changes I will make again

If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would!  This is literally the best banana bread I've ever had--so moist and delicious.  And I did not tweak the recipe at all, except to scale it down to make just one loaf, and it turned out perfectly, so I don't know what others' problems with it were.  This will be my go-to banana bread recipe from now on.

Average banana bread to me.  The baking instructions cannot be correct. I followed the recipe perfectly and cooked at 300 for an hour and had soup in the middle.So I covered with tin foil since the top was already brown and baked another 15 min.  At least it was cooked but it tasted like regular ol' banana bread to me.  I only cooked one at a time so maybe by adjusting the temp...the others will turn out better. This just goes to show how frustrating it is when a recipe has 5 stars because people rate it based on their own tweaks and adjustments.  This is not a 5 star recipe.

This recipe was a complete failure.  The batch was too big for the mixing bowl.  The loaves came out of the pans (Greased and sugared as per directions) in pieces.  The texture is crumbly and the bite is gummy.  A complete waste of time and ingredients.

Thank you for sharing your recipe. This is the "BEST" banana bread I've made. It was popular at work and espcially at home. Hubby kept nibbling on it all day during his projects at home :) I am passing the recipe onto my co-workers :) Looking forward to having it with my coffee tomorrow morning :)

Very moist! I added macadamia nuts instead of walnuts.  I split the batter and made muffins with chocolate chips, muffins without, and also mini loaves. I adjusted the cooking time to each batch.  Cooked until a toothpick came out clean.  My family loved them all.

Phenomenal!!! This will be my go-to banana bread recipe. I made 2 regular sized loaves and four mini loaves with this recipe. It does freeze great and maybe even tastes better after its been thawed than fresh out of the oven. Sooo moist!

I did change this recipe just a bit.  I used 4 cups of self rising flour instead of all the measuring with the all purpose items,  and it turned out great... also, since I don't like tasting the banana flavor all day (if you know what I mean) I only used 4 bananas... but my family/friends loved it... this is a keeper... I have now made it twice... once with pecans instead of walnuts... and it is still a hit......

We really loved this bread! I scaled this down to one loaf, using 1.5 bananas. Next time I will use 2. baked for 55 min...little too long. The sugar on the outside was awesome! Next time I will use a nice, thick layer!

Made this again with 2 bananas and 1/3 cup of sour cream. Very moist and hubs loved it!

Wow- this is by far the best banana bread I've ever had. I put additional cinnamon, sugar and walnuts on top of the loaf before putting it in the oven. That topping made the bread so yummy! Everyone loved it- I have never had so many compliments on my cooking before!

Super delicious. I also added 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips... I couldn't stop myself from snacking every time I walked by in the kitchen. My boyfriend took a loaf to work and the pan was picked clean in less than a half hour!

PERFECT!  I have never used bananas before that I had frozen so I took them all out and gave it a try.  Have the bananas defrost in a bowl cause so much of the water seperates from the bananas.  I didn't not use the remaining water in the recipe.  I had so many bananas I made a double batch.  Holy Moly! we will be eating banana bread for a long time to come.  I did add a few chocolate chips to some just to see.  They are still in the oven.  will let you know!  
Thank you for the fab recipe!

Awesome bread! Making it for a second time, going to use some orange zest. Last time I used brown sugar and pecans instead of white sugar and walnuts.

This cake recipe is wonderful. I omitted the first part. I reduced the amount of flour to 2 1/2 cups and reduced the cooking time to 45 minutes, added some molasses by eye, reduced sugar to 2 cups. Keep an eye on it so it does not burn. Pam sprayed the cup cake pan and filled them 3/4 full. Made cup cakes for on the go!!!!! REALLY GOOD

5 stars and over 3000 reviews can't lie. I have made this for a few years in a row now for the holidays and in mass quantities. Turns out perfect every time. I put a crumble on the top and it turns out absolutely delicious!

Thank U so much for a great recipe. I make it at least once a month. The only thing I changed is amount of sugar I use. Instead of 3 cups I use 1 cup of white and half cup of brown.

Really good.  I cut the recipe in half (2 eggs and only 1 cup of sugar) and it took about 45 minutes in my oven. Note: Initially I gave this a 4 (since I couldn't do a 4.5) - the next day I have upgraded it to a 5.  I wrapped them and left them on the counter and they are fabulous!

Not impressive at all...I found the sour cream added heaviness to an already dense bread (banana bread is not an airy light sweet bread by nature), but it's a good way to use up sour cream if you need to.

This was so yummy! I didn't have loaf pans so I made muffins instead. They turned out great! I'm always afraid to try dessert recipes because I don't want to waste my ingredients if it doesn't turn out right. This recipe is a keeper! Even with the cinnamon sugar crust they weren't too sweet.

This is too die for!  Made the recipe without any changes.  I highly recommend adding the optional walnuts.  I made it both ways because my kids claimed they didn't like walnuts.  Well they discovered this was much better with walnuts!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!

I just made this banana bread about a week ago and it turned out amazing! It's the first time I've ever attempted making it and my husband said it was the best banana bread he's had. I did almost everything exactly as instructed but took a few other reviewers tips and made 3 9x5 loaves baked at 325 degrees for an hour and 10 minutes. I also used 5 large bananas since I didn't have 6 and it still tasted great. Take it from a first timer, this banana bread is awesome!! I was super apprehensive to try making it because we love banana bread at our house and I didn't want to make something only to have it turn out yucky. It was very easy and better than the banana bread that people have made for us. Thank you for a recipe that I will be using for years to come!

I don't like banana bread but was told by everyone how great this was. Adding a crumble topping like other reviewers suggested gave it an extra something special. I also cut the recipe in half (only had enough bananas for half) and increased the baking time a bit. A keeper!

This was the best banana bread I have ever had!  Everyone loved it!  It was so moist  and delicious.  I followed saralady19's review - what great advise.  I even used the crumbly topping.  I would never use another banana bread recipe.  Thank you!!!

So good!  I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, cut the sugar down to 2 cups, used 8 bananas (that's what I had) and used 1/4 c. butter + 2/3 c. apple sauce to cut the fat.  I also made muffins (it made 30 big ones) instead of loaves.  They were fluffy, moist, with just enough sweetness.

This banana bread was really good!  I substiuted Greek yogurt for the sour cream as I was out of sour cream.  I also cut out 1/2 cup of the sugar might try a full cup next time as I am feeding this to my kids and do not like them to have tons of sugar.  Turned out really moist and yummy it was gone very quick.

Fantastic!  I made this recipe as written and it was very moist and delicious.  The only changes I made were to add one additional banana and I cooked the bread 10 minutes longer then the recipe called for.

This is a wonderful recipe. Instead of the bread version, I made large muffins. They freeze well. 2 minutes in the microwave, instant breakfast. I have posted a picture of my finished product. I made some minor changes to the recipe. I didn't have white sugar available. So I used 1 cup of brown sugar for the muffins. 3/4 cup of applesauce instead of butter. 2 cups of wheat flour, 2 1/2 of all purpose. A couple of dashes of nutmeg. I had a cup of blueberries that needed to be used up. I threw that in there as well (otherwise they would have walked out of the fridge.) I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar and cinnamon as a topping instead of using it on the bottom. This recipe is in my recipe box. Thank for sharing!

Yummy!  I cut the recipe in half because I didn't want that much bread -- it made one large loaf and one medium size loaf.  For the sugar, I used half brown, half white.  Used one egg and just added an additional banana.  Also, need to bake a bit longer, it was still mushy in the middle.  Overall, loved it!  Husband loved it!  Will make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This recipe makes a ton, but you'll eat it, or find someone who will. Super easy to make, and super delicious. I usually don't like the bottom of the bread, but the cinnamon/sugar on dusted on the pan is a stroke of genius. Yum!

This was really good. My sour cream container was only half full so I subbed an 8oz container of expired plain greek yogurt I had in the fridge. Delicious!

This came out  very wrong the first time I made it.  I realized cooking it at 300 degrees was the problem. I have been making this recipe for about 4 years now and it is so good! I cook it at 325 degrees and it comes out perfect. I make muffins and loaves using this and either way it comes out awesome. My kids simply love it and my husband can eat a whole loaf  all by himself. I would adjust the temp to either 325 or 350 for about  45 min to an hour for a loaf. My muffins cook faster.

made 1/2 this recipe and it was plenty to make 2 loaves.  Only used 1 cup of sugar and it's plenty sweet.  I baked on 325 degrees for 70 minutes and it was perfect!

This is the first banana bread recipe I could get my family to approve of, and they beg for it!  Just a note... I tried it as muffins which didn't turn out so well, but the bread is to die for.  I also sprinkle a little of the cinnamon sugar on top before I bake it and it makes a delicious crust.

This banana bread recipe is a winner through and through!!  It's the only recipe I use because it's one that EVERYONE asks for after trying it.  I make it with and without the nuts and sometimes as muffins!  Every way you want it this recipe is great!! The recipe in itself is for more banana bread than I ever really need at one time but I usually make the full recipe because it freezes really well.  So have some now, share some with someone else and save some for later!  Top it with a little whipped cream cheese and serve with a cup of tea or coffee and a smile will appear on your face!!  Double YUM from my crew!

My kids wanted to make some banana bread for Teacher Appreciaton week.  This recipe was easy to make.  The small amount of ingredients was perfect for them to stay focused and finish the recipe.  And, the bread turned out delicious!  They were so proud.

I can mess up a recipe in no time! I tried to halve this recipe and ended up combining all the wrong ratios. It still was tasty. Then I really focused and made the seemingly large 32 Servings recipe (as shown)... Oh my goodness! I had a loaf for everyone and now everyone wants a loaf. I will double the recipe next time... ;-) Thank you for the amazing bread recipe!

Oh so good....I toasted the walnuts before adding them to the bread and added 1 1/2 cups walnuts.
I baked 3 loaves for 1 hours on 350 and it was perfect.

this is REALLY GOOD, similiar to the choc chip banana muffins on this site which i make with walnuts. i halved the recipe, and i used about 2 tbs butter...didnt have a hand mixer so i just whisked it with 1 cup sugar..i used only 1 egg, i forgot the cinamon and half cup walnuts and used only 2 cups flour baked in 2 loaf pans at 325 for 1 hour and 10 minutes perfectly cooked!!!... i also felt like it was a little sweeter than id like so next time im goign do to 3/4 cup of sugar

**UPDATE IVE MADE THIS AGAIN TODAY AFTER A WHILE**
For half the recipe...
I used 2 tbsp melted Smart balance butter, and 3/4 cup of sugar. I kept everything else the same, but used FAGE NONFAT YOGURT instead of sour cream...and 4 ripe bananas, and 2 cups flour. Awesome for breakfast!!

I didn't think this was so great. I am an intermediate baker, followed the recipe...meh. Kind of bland really. Pretty surprised. Maybe I overcooked it? But I don't think so.

I have to add to the accolades of all the other 5-star ratings!  This is a delicious banana sweet bread!  I prepared as the instructions (excepted mixed wet/dry ingredients together by-hand) and used a Wilton pan with four mini loaves.  The recipe made 8 loaves, exactly!  I sprayed the pan with non-stick spray so the cinnamon/sugar would stick.  The cinnamon/sugar is a great addition! Thanks for sharing, Esther!

It was very good but the recipe was way too large!  I ended up making an 8x8 pan and a regular size loaf pan.  My 8x8 cooked perfectly but my loaf pan was overcooked :(    Try adding chocolate chips, it's delicious!

Awesome.  Never liked any kind of nuts in anything sweet until I tried walnuts in this bread.  Best banana bread I've ever had.  Baking time is hard to get right so you'll have to watch it closely depending on your pan size and temperature setting.

Is very moist with just the right amount of banana taste. I did cook on 350 for 1 hour. Used only a half cup (1 stick) of butter to cut back on calories and fat and it's still  great. Like the fact that can make ahead and freeze.

Wonderful! I made it last night and it's almost gone. The cinnamon and sugar sprinkled onto the greased pan is an idea I'll take with me for a long time, the crust is delicious.

I didn't have any sour cream so I used vanilla yogurt, came out great! The only complaint I had is one hour at 300 degrees was way too short--I think I had to bake it for at least 1 hour and 45 minutes. Keep that in mind if you're baking on a schedule. ;)

Not sure what happened, but I followed the recipe and ended up with "flopped" loves, and an overpowering flavor of sour cream.  Won't be making this one again...

This is the best banana bread that I have ever made.  As a macho man, I like baking and I learned it from my mother.  Yeah, Mama's boy here.  Regardless, I had no sour cream, so I used non-fat plain Greek style yogurt.  I also used half all-purpose flour and half almond-flour.  It bakes perfectly!  My wife and daughter love it!

FABULOUS!!!!!! Perfection!  I didn't have the same size pans as called for. baked 2 in 9" loaf pans & had enough batter left for 6 muffins. Just keep watch over the baking time as muffins cooked up fast. Usually use light sour cream, but splurged & went for ther real deal...so worth the calories... The cinnamon/sugar in the pan adds a lot... Recipe called for 2 tsp cinnamon, then had you put 1 tsp in with 1/4 c sugar for the pans....later said to "add the cinnamon" to the mixutre...Wasn't sure if it meant the additional 1 tsp or another 2 tsp....so I added 1 generous tsp....turned out great.Wonderfully moist & delicious...Thanks!

This is the ONLY recipe I will use for Banana bread ever again!  The sour cream makes it just delicious.  It has a great texture.  This makes 4 full sized loafs, so make sure you have enough pans.  Delicious... it's disappears very quickly at our house!

Amazing recipe! I only used 1 rather large loaf pan, 15x11?? I might need to adjust the heat and cooking time due to this next time though. the center was soft, like bread pudding. but very very delicious!

I made this recipe this morning for breakfast and it was super easy and definately bomb!  I cut the recipe in half and did what one of the reviews had suggested by baking at 325 degrees and cooked it a little over an hour.  I also sprinkled a little of the walnuts on top of the batter before putting in the the oven. I will obviously be making this recipe again and this time, no need to cut recipe in half, we'll be gobbling the whole thing up.

I made the recipe as it was written & it was fantastic! It yields about twice the normal banana bread recipe, I should have guessed that when I saw it required 6 bananas, huh?!

This is actually my second review... couldn't figure out how to add to that one so starting anew.. :o)  

this bread is AWESOME! The first time I made it with only 5 very overripe bananas, and it turned out delish.  The second time I made it with 6 bananas that only had 1 or 2 brown spots on them (thought for sure the bread wouldn't turn out) and it turned out wonderfully, maybe even better than the first time!  Whoever said that they had to be rotten is WRONG!  And both times I've made this recipe I've used Splenda, and it's amazing how fast this bread has disappeared.  
Also, be sure to make a topping for it.  I use a few shakes of cinnamon (I eyeball it... approx 2 teaspoons), half-stick butter - softened, 1/2 cup brown sugar and a 1/2 cup flour.  

The next time I make it I may try using that topping in the bottom of the pan, too.  Mmmm...

halved the recipe, but probably used a bit too much butter.  crumble on top didn't really stay as a crumble (when added from the beginning)...it oozed into the bread instead.  

this tasted more like cake and less like bread.

This banana bread is the best! I have to say I did mess up the first time by putting too much in a loaf pan and having it erupt in my oven like a volcano. So that one got thrown out and after the second try, I had perfection! I added a crumble topping like another reviewer suggested and it melted in my mouth! So good! I did half the recipe and still got plenty! Thank-you for this great recipe, I will be making this often :)

I was not a big fan of banana bread but I had a couple of black bananas and some sour cream close to expiring. I cut the recipe by two thirds since I only had 2 bananas and used a mini loaf pan. I baked for 50 minutes at 300 and probably could have taken them out after 45. I ended up with 7 cute little mini banana bread loaves to wrap individually. My husband and I each tried one and they are great!

The best banana bread I have ever made. So moist and almost decadent without being overwhelmingly rich, it's more like a dessert than others I have tried before. I only had one bread pan, so I baked the rest of the batter in a Bundt pan and it came out even better than the normal sized loaf. I also put chocolate chips in the smaller pan and it was delicious! I will definitely be making this again, many times.

I liked the cinnamon sugar coating from the pan.      The recipe was too large for what I wanted, so divided it in half.  I also used a larger loaf pan but cooked it for 1/2 longer, so it was fine.

I was in a hurry to get breads done for gifts during the holiday and didn't get very ripe banana's. So, there wasn't much banana flavor, but it is moist. Will make again with ripe friut and maybe add an extra banana cut up in small chunks?

This bread was so good! This recipe is way to large though. I usually read other reviews and change the recipes, but this one is perfect as is.

Best banana bread I've ever had.  Followed the recipe exactly for a high school cooking demonstration - we ended up with about 12 loaves and every one of them turned out perfect!

This just didn't have the right spices for us.  The cinnamon seemed overwhelming, but the taste somehow lacked something else --not sure what that would be.  It WAS very moist and very EASY to make.  I liked the sour cream addition, so I may try again and tweak the spices.

Definately the best banana bread recipe I've tried yet!  I made this for Christmas goodie bags and I'm very proud to have included a loaf of this moist, flavorful bread in each one.  I took other reviewers' advice and baked the loaves at 325.  I used two 8" pans and one 9" pan.  I cooked the 8" loaves for 1 hour 5 mins. and the 9" loaf for 1 hour 10 mins.  I don't understand why some people had so much trouble with the timing.  I use glass loaf pans - perhaps metal pans cook differently?  I followed the recipe exactly and will do the same next time - I wouldn't change a thing.  It's perfect :)

I love to read through all of the reviews before I make anything.  However, I just didn't have the time this time around.  Guess what?  You don't need to either.  Don't change a thing about this recipe and you will have an amazingly moist, flavorful bread that won't last long in the house!  YUMMY!

I've tried banana bread recipes before, and have had problems with dry, dense bread. Not this time! This recipe is so moist, so fluffy. Such a wonderful recipe. I cut the recipe in half, and still cut the sugar by another 1/2 cup. I also used extra bananas. Such a great tasting bread recipe!

My husband told me this was the best banana bread I had every made - a perfect 10.  I did add about a teaspoon of nutmeg and ground cloves, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It is wonderful!  
I usually double the recipe and make 7 loaves

Very good!  A tad too sweet, more like a dessert bread.  But loved all around by my family.  I also tried it with a cream cheese frosting for half of it.  I would cut out a 1/2 to 1 cup of sugar.  Especially if you're going to frost or ice it.

This banana bread recipe is delicious! It has great flavors - I will definitely be making it again! The only problem I had was that 1 hour at 300 degrees is NOT enough to cook this bread. I halved the recipe and after an hour, my bread was not done. I recommend raising the temperature to 325 degrees.

The one hour bake time was totally off. It was probably closer to 2 by the time I took it out of the oven but it tastes great and is nice and soft. I ran out of sour cream so I used non fat raspberry yogurt for most of it. It worked great.

I used chocolate chips instead of walnuts and re-sized the recipe to make one loaf (serves 10 according to the site).  Oh my goodness.  First off, the batter?  Tasted AMAZING.  Not chalky like most banana bread batter tastes.  The bread smelled amazing all through cooking as well, I could barely make myself wait for it to cool.  SO worth it.  This is quite possibly one of the tastiest recipes I've ever made.

This was delicious.  In order to cut down on some of the fat/calories but still get the slight tartness of the sour cream, I substituted low fat greek style yogurt (I used chobani) and it was delicious

Did everything that Lindabtx did...but swapped all flour for whole wheat (used 2 cups for 1/2 the recipe).  Will sign back on to add my rating...smelling good so far!

I downsized the servings size since I didn't have enough sour cream, and made a few changes. First off, I changed the temp to 375, as other reviewers stated 300 was way too low. 2) I added an extra egg, because 24 servings says 2 1/4 egg, well ok. 3) I added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg again as other reviewers suggested. 4. I added Terry's chocolate orange chocolate to the top of a few muffins (works very well if I do say so myself!)  I would suggest pureeing the bananas, as the muffins came out with chunks of mushy banana, could be caused by a lack of mashing on my part but I also used a hand-mixer. In the end, this is a really good recipe. I will continue to search for a better one, but will definitly use this one again. Thank you

This is a nice take on an old favorite.  The bread came out moist and flavorful.  The only thing that I would suggest is to toast the walnuts to bring out their flavor.

I made mine in my Pampered Chef mini loaf pans and baked it at 350 for 45 minutes. I sprinkled some of the sugar mixture on the top while baking, YUMM.

This recipe creates the most popular banana bread I have ever made and shared with others.  The sour cream is not a flavor in itself; rather, it melds the other flavors together.  The butter/cinnamon sugar coating is a popular, sweet surprise.  When I make this bread, I deliver small loaves to friends and relatives.  One friend confessed to me that she hides the loaf behind the toaster so it isn't devoured by her kids in one morning!  This wonderful recipe is a permanent addition to my box.

Talk about deee-licious!!! I made half of what the recipe called for, baked it in a bundt cake pan and it came out perfect!! I baked it at 350 for 50 mins.  My husband loved it and it was a big hit at the office.  I will definitely make this again.

I was very excited when I saw the great reviews, however this bread was okay but not great. Like others said it took longer to bake, in fact about at least 20 minutes more for each loaf. The bread was moist but it was missing the banana taste and when it was baking it had faint smell of pretzels.

COOKING TIME.  One hour is not enough.  I cook all four loaves at once and for no less than 90 minutes.  Sometimes additional 10-15 if needed.  No worries, there is enough sour cream in this bread to keep it very moist.  Plus... the top get's a little crispy.  OMG tasty crispyness get in my belly goodness.

This was great and everyone who tried it asked for the recipe.  I added dates just because I had them.  I baked it at 325 and kept an eye on it as I used different sized loaf pans.  It froze really well and was wonderful served with cream cheese!

I have made many different recipes of banana bread and never had one stand out like this.  I usually don't make banana bread my first choice in using up ripe bananas.  However, this recipe was excellent.  Other than leaving out the nuts, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was phenomenally good!  Way better than any other banana breads that I have made. Will definitely make again and have already shared the recipe :)  NOTE: I did bake these in my convection oven and it was very most and delicious!  Took only 45 minutes to bake (not the 1 hr. stated in the recipe).  I do have a double oven so I put 2 loaves in each for baking.  Not sure how they would have done with 4 loaves in one oven.  As another note to another review that stated they baked it at 300 and it was raw in the center - either follow the advice of others to up the temp or get an oven thermometer and make sure your oven is calibrated correctly. I don't know if the original poster used convection and that is why it worked for them and me at 300.  I will try this again on my regular bake setting and let you know the results.

Love this recipe! I always end up having extra bananas at the end of the week. I always had a hard time with dry banana bread with other recipes, but this is awesome! Very moist and delicious, great with chocolate chips and a little peanut butter. It also freezes well. We have 2 loaves in the freezer right now!

This is the first time I've reviewed a recipe because it is THAT good.  I will never ever make another bread recipe!  It was exceptional and oh soooo yummy.  I halved it and used one 11X5 loaf pan.  I used 2 eggs instead of 1.5.  It is sweet, but I think it's delicious!!   I may try to cut down on the sugar next time (but doubt it).  I also took another person's advice and made a cinamon sugar topping.  I did bake at 325 for 1hr15min.

I only added 2 1/2 c sugar and added 1/2 c sour cream and 1/2 c. plain yogurt instead of all sour cream. Everything else I did per the recipe and I ended up with 3 regular sized loafs. Very moist and they freeze very well!

This is the best banana bread I've ever eaten.  I only had 5 bananas, instead of the 6 that it called for.  It turned out very moist and soft.  Delicious!

This was my first time making banana bread without a mix and i will never use a mix again. This recipe was so easy and delicious ! i even messed up and put a little extra butter then what the recipe called for but it didn't hurt it a bit. The recipe made 5 small loaves and a dozen muffins so there was plenty to share.The bread didn't last long enough around here for me to find out.

I am just learning how to bake and cook. So, I was a little nervous making this bread.  But, I had a lot of overly ripe bananas to use.  So, I tried it this weekend.  The bread turned out moist and not overly sweet or heavy.  I was able to make three 12 loaves and made up for it by baking at 325 and covering the tops with aluminum foil 20 minutes before done. I also sprinkled cinnamon and sugar mixture for the top of the bread.  Delicious!

This recipe is outstanding! I LOVE banana bread more than any other kind of fruit breads and at 45 years old, I've sampled many. Don't tell my mom but, this one is better than her recipe! The sour cream adds for a very moist consistency as well as adding just a slight tangyness that's sure to please the taste buds! Highly recommended.

My loaves were completly raw in the center.  I tried adjusting the temperature, leaving them in longer, nothing helped.  What was cooked around the outside tasted great, but I ultimately had to just throw them out.

c hange the sugar into 2 cups and add 1/4 c brown sugar, perfect. i love to mix them all with a mixer to make a fluffier cake instead of bread. it does need more bannana flavour but i love love it. 150 c is the perfect temp to make it evenly cooked and nicely brown

I really liked this recipe. It is a dense bread and the taste is great.I agree that the time cooked needs to be increased. An easy fix! Just watch the last 10 minutes of the stated 1 hour cooking time and adjust. This has to be done with most recipes...different oven, different times to perfection.

YUM. I halved the recipe and it made plenty-loaves were gone in a day because my three boys ate almost a whole loaf each in 24 hours! Only change I made was to add a little nutmeg. I will use this forever.

I made this last night. It was AWESOME. I pureed my bananas and used pecans instead of walnuts. Only one slice left today.

Had some very ripe bananas! Wanted to make something for my kids after school.... My house smells wonderful and this is the best banana bread I have ever had.   Only used four bananas ( cause thats all I had ) I bet would even taste better, if thats possiable, with the full six.  YUMMY!!!!

This is so delicious and simple. I didn't have sour cream, so I strained some yogurt to get the liquid out and used that. Which, coincidentally, lightened the recipe up calorie/fat wise. It was so delicious, moist, and sense. Especially because I hand stirred everything after the eggs. Yummy, I want some right now.

Made this today, and it was fantastic.  While baking it filled my home with the most wonderful aroma...yum.  My mom said it was the best she had ever tasted...with that said, I give it 5 stars.  I greased my pan with margerine and sprinkled it with cinnamon and sugar before pouring the mixture in (as directed), it made the crust a little sweet and kept it from being to dry.  I also brushed butter on top once I pulled the finished bread out of the oven. So good!!

Very good!! My husband gave it 5 stars! Not too sweet for him. Perfect texture. I cut the recipe in 1/2 since I only had 3 bananas, and baked at 325 in 1 deep 9x5 loaf pan for about 1 1/2 hours.  The only changes I made were that I used 2 eggs for 1/2 the recipe, and 1/3 C butter, 1 C white sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar, and a dash of nutmeg.  One complaint: when I took it out of the pan the outside was a bit soggy--I think because of the sugar/cinnamon coating on the pan? Or maybe I left it in the pan too long when it was cooling? Anyways, I just threw it back in the oven for 10 minutes (at 350) to dry out the outside of the loaf & that worked great. The sugar/cinnamon and nuts on top were a great, easy addition. Will do that again.  This will be my new "always use" banana bread recipe!!

This came out great.  I scaled it down for one loaf (and 2 bananas) by changing the servings to 9.  Just remember, that doesn't change the sour cream measurements, so you have to do a little math.  It was delicious and moist.  I followed the directions exactly.  Plenty of banana flavor.

Very good.  I accidentally used 1 cup of butter instead of 3/4 and everything still turned out fine.  I only had two bread pans so made the rest as muffins and they were delicious.  I topped some of the muffins with Heath Bar brickle - yummy!

Amazing bread!  So easy to make and sinfully delicious and moist!  I made it exactly as called for.  The only change I made was I used 3 larger loaf pans instead of the smaller ones suggested on the recipe.  I had to bake them longer than called for since the loaf pans were bigger.  We immediately ate one loaf while it was still warm.  We spread some butter on the slices and it was super delicious.  The second loaf, I've saved for breakfast for the kids this week.  The third loaf, I wrapped tightly and put in the freezer.  I'll never use another recipe again!  AWESOME!

I was skeptical at first, but this recipe is the BOMB!  I couldn't stop eating these.  My wife makes banana bread a lot, but this recipe takes the cake.  I added some streusel topping (sugar, butter, flour), but other than that, used the same recipe.  As mentioned by other reviewers, cook at 325 for 1 hour and 10 or 15 minutes.  300 is too low...

My go to recipe for banana bread.  I usually 1/2 the recipe, and bake in a 9x5 loaf pan at 350 for about an hour.  I use only one cup of sugar and it turns out great!!!  Ocassionaly I add semi-sweet chocolate chips. Very good recipe!

This is THE BEST Banana Bread recipe ever.    I made another highly rated one only a couple days ago and although it was good too, this one blew it out of the water.      My hubby loved them and wanted to eat 3 cupcakes (I made a loaf and then 2 batches of cupcakes with one mixture) and I had to tell him to slow down, LOL.    Thanks so much.  This will be made again and again!  Off to write this down and send it to my sister!  :)

Ok, I have made this several times and finally decided I needed to rate it! This bread is delicious! I subbed applesauce for the butter, used fat FREE sour cream, and it still turned out really, really good! The slight tang of sour cream without the calories! And it is really really moist too:)

I did not care for this. I was worried about the temp. and consitency and I was right. It was completely raw in the middle. Its not a good recipe if you have to make so many adjustments to get it right. try another recipe.

This recipe was a "hit" with my family! Delicious and Moist-I loved the idea of adding the cinnamon and sugar to the pan after greasing, and to the top of the batter before baking. I will be baking again for fundraisers and family gifts. I also tried the both the dark and the shiny aluminum pans. The shiny won me over for best results-the dark baked a bit too fast for me and was not as moist but still Delicious!.

AMAZING! Can also be cut down easily to 1-3 loaves. I substitute half whole wheat flour, and it still tastes yum. Also, to add healthy points, I add a sugar/butter streusel topping. This is my favorite banana bread recipe that I have tried so far.

This is very moist banana bread. I was taking this to a Christmas brunch and wanted something festive, so I made the following modifications. I added a jar of marachino cherries that I halved, and a can of pineapple tidbits that I squeezed most of the juice out of.  I also added roasted pistachios, but I won't do that again; they turned soft. I also used fat-free sour cream and it worked just fine. This took a long time to bake -- about 1-1/2 hours, and it didn't rise much (i.e., it didn't have a domed top). To serve, I sliced the loaf down the center length-wise, then turned to slice cross-wise. This made nice individual pieces that I put on a Christmas tree-shaped tray.  I decorated with maraschino cherries to look like ornaments and put a star-shaped cookie on top. It was colorful and very tasty. My family can't wait for me to make this again.  Thanks Esther!

Moist, with a good texture, but LACKS a WOW FACTOR in the FLAVOR.  I would definitely add more nuts, bananas, and cinnamon.  I would add fresh ground nutmeg to the recipe as well.  I baked the bread at 325 for 90 minutes. It was not fully baked at 60 minutes.

I made the best Banana Bread/Cake ever utilizing this recipe. Usually the loaves turn out too dense and heavy so I substituted CAKE FLOUR for all of the all purpose flour. (I guess you could do half and half too) I also used FAT FREE SOUR CREAM. It was super light and tasty.     I halved the recipe, used one 9 inch square cake pan, and baked it for 40 minutes on 300° and the remaining 20 minutes, covered with foil, at 350°.     It came out perfectly baked. Finally!!! After sooo many banana bread recipes.

This recipe is my new favorite for banana bread!  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is b/c the directions to cook it at 300 degrees, cannot be right!  I had to increase the temp and cook for another 20 min b/c they were originally very raw in the middle!  Once they were done....AMAZING!

Yummmmm! The only thing I can add to this is that a friend of mine clued me in to using Coconut Oil in baking awhile back and I ALWAYS use some in place of some butter in quick breads and cookies. It's a soft solid a room temp (except summer :D ) and a liquid oil above about 75 degrees. It adds just a hint of flavor that everyone that tastes my baking loves, but can't quite put their finger on...the perfect secret ingredient! Try substituting 1/2 the oil/butter in a recipe. My favorites for using it are...Banana Bread, duh, and chocolate chip walnut cookies (or white chocolate macadamia nut!). You can spend $$$$ at a health food store for Coconut oil, but I find it in the vitamin section of my local Walmart for $10 (sounds like a lot for a little jar, but you don't need much and it's soooo good and good for you!...that's my justification for eating the Banana Bread and cookies, hahaha, Girl Math!

This banana bread was so moist and delicious. This is officially my go to recipe for banana bread. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. Another user suggested a crumbly topping, which I tried, but thought it made the bread wayyyyyy too sweet. I ended up cutting the top off and just enjoying the slice without it. It's so perfect as is, it really doesn't need it. Enjoy!

Very good but very sweet.  I followed recipe exactly. Used the very best pan release but the loaves stuck.  Next time I will not put the sugar ion the bottom and sides of pan.  The bread is sweet and the extra sugar is not needed and was the cause of the loaves sticking.Next time I will cut the sugar by 1/4 to 1/2 a cup.

This was pretty tasty! I made two loaves and twelve muffins instead of four loaves of banana bread. I thought this could use some more walnuts, and the suggestion about adding a crumbly topping sounds like a good one. I will definitely make this again.

Awesome flavor and very light and airy!  Like other reviewers I added a little nutmeg to the batter and to the pan dusting.  Mine didn't rise, but I think I might not have put in enough baking soda (or it was too old)  I would try again but would cut the amount in 1/2 so I can use my food processor to mix the entire recipe.  Too bad I can't give it more than 5 stars because it's a keeper.

We love this at my house! I actually  throw a GOOD amount of cinnamon/sugar on the bottom of the pan. I love the way it tastes all around - not just the top of the loaf! :)

The best Banana Bread Recipe EVER! I had family over for 10 days and we went through two batches. I couldn't believe the 2 year old ate a whole 1/2 a loaf himself (that alone says a lot about how good it is). I actually put everything in the blender to  make sure there was no chunks. Both times the loafs came out perfectly. YUM!

Wow! This was great banana bread. It was a painful hour of waiting for the loaves to bake--the smell was making my mouth water! The sour cream makes it very moist without a sour cream taste. I followed the recipe and directions exactly except I covered the loaves with tin foil 20 minutes before they were done baking to prevent the tops from being to well done, and I used only five bananas because one of them had gone bad and I only had six. I also whipped the bananas with a hand mixer, and sprinkled the extra cinnamon-sugar mixture I had left on top of the loaves before putting in the oven. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Didn't care for the texture.  More like a cake texture than a bread.  Also the cinnamon overpowered the banana flavor.  And lastly, the oven temperature seems low.  All the other quick bread recipes I've used bake at 350 degrees.  The top didn't get very crunchy.

I cut this recipe in half as I only had 3 ripe bananas on hand (used 2 eggs) and this made enough for 2 loaves.  I made one without nuts and one with as my kids don't like nuts.   Everyone loved how moist and delicious this was.  As with previous reviews I baked the bread at 325 for 1 hour 10 minutes and it was perfect.

THE BEST BANANA BREAD I HAVE EVER HAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i leave out the nuts and bake it in mini loaf pans for my childs school bake sale's and it's a HUGE HIT! i make it for the holidays as well and it's the talk of the day. i have a small family so the 2 loafs it makes is too much to eat in one week so i wrap up one and freeze it and when it comes time for some more i thaw it in the refrigerator over night  (10-12 hours) once thawed i bring to room temperature and it is FRESH AS THE DAY I MADE IT, REMARKABLE!!!

It's true!  The sour cream keeps this bread very moist.  Note that the recipe is for mini-loafs and you definitely need to increase baking time to make a large loaf.

The is the BEST banana bread recipe I've ever tried and it has become a staple in our home.  I've made it at least six or seven times and it has turned out beautifully every time.  Dusting the pans with cinnamon sugar is a must!  With this recipe, I use a bundt cake pan and fill 1/2 full and use the rest of the batter to make approximately four or five mini loaves which I share with co-workers and friends.  Thank you Esther for a wonderful recipe!

So yummy and moist!  I made a couple of loaves -- one with pecans and one without -- for a weekend outing w/ 5 other families and it was a HUGE hit!  Both of my kids (18 and 10) loved it as well.  Will definitely be making it again.

This was my first time making banana bread. I made 3 loaves in 8x3 pans and had a bit too much batter for that. It came out great. I had to cook it longer because my pans were larger than the recipe pan size, but that's to be expected. It got RAVE reviews. "The most awesome" "Unreal" "oh my God make more!" stuff like that. I used some brown sugar on the top of the loaves. Next time I'll try coconut, butterscotch chips, etc. I like making a few loaves because you can make a few different alterations. Great recipe.

I made this recipe a week ago and my husband promptly finished it in three days and I keep hearing make it again, make it again!  I try to always add something extra nutritional to a recipe.  For this recipe I cut the butter to 1/2cup and then added 1/4cup apple sauce and two carrots grated.  You can't taste any difference other than how fantastic it is.  I also added a can of pumpkin puree to half of the batter.  My husband kept debating which was better, with or without pumpkin.  He could never decide becuase both were fantastic!

I've made this four times so far and twice it came out right;  the other two times it didn't rise properly, so inside was gooey.  When it came out right it was fantastic! I still haven't figured out what I did differently to make this work or not but I'm suspecting my oven...

This is a fabulous recipe. I didn't use the cinnamon sugar to coat my loaf pans; I used loaf stones. The bread came out very chewy on the outside and extremly moist on the inside. I had to bake longer than the hour stated- kept checking the center- maybe because I used alot of bananas.  Still, this was one great bread!!

Wow!  How great was this banana bread.  My husband & I couldn't stop munching on it.  I didn't use the egg, the batter was so creamy I didn't think it needed it.  The cinnamon sugar was finger licking good.

Wonderful Recipe!!!!!! I made a few changes:  I cut the recipe in half and made 2 loaves instead of 4. I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar instead of all white sugar.  I added 1 c of chocolate chunks instead of nuts (not big nut lovers in the family).  I added a crunchy topping consisting of: 1/4 c brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, 3 TBSP of flour, 1/4 c toffee crunches.  Absolutely yummy!!!!  I will make it again and again!!

This recipe was simple and great! I cut it in half because the whole recipe would have been too much. I made 16 muffins and one loaf of bread. I added a tablespoon of vanilla and cinamon instead of a teaspon. Cooked at 325. The muffins for about 30-35 minutes and the bread for 55 minutes. The last 20 minutes I covered with tin foil. Easy, fast and the whole family loved!

Absolutely delicious!   I don't care much for banana bread but I had bought to many bananas and was left with several bananas that were getting too ripe.
I made this bread and was instantly hooked along with my family and everyone who had a piece of it.

I made 3 breads and they were gone in no time

This definitely was really good. I would make it again! :) I followed the suggestions of the reviewers - I halved the recipe, first as I had no need for 4 loafs of bread. I like my breads spicy so I actually put double the cinnamon, and put a dash of nutmeg and a dash of cloves as well. I used light sour cream and it was fine. I did cut the sugar as I wanted this to be more for breakfast than a dessert to 3/4 of a cup of white sugar. Next time I think I will try brown sugar instead.  The only thing about this bread that does not give it the 5 stars is that I like my breads a tad big denser. This was a tad more "cake-like" but nevertheless, delicious! :) I also did the streussel topping with the 1/2 cup flour and brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 2 tablespoons butter before I put it in the oven. Because of this, I thought cutting the sugar was a must, otherwise it would definitely be too sweet. Had no problems with the bread rising. I baked at 325 for 55 minutes with 2 8x3 pans (the aluminum disposable bread pans at the grocery store) and it came out clean with a toothpick. My boyfriend thought the bread was DELICIOUS and especially liked it with the topping. I am an avid baker so he is used to things making the kitchen smell nice but when he smelt this he said his mouth completely started watering!! The aroma this bread let out when it was baking was one I've never smelt before ... it was fabulous. :)

I have tried many banana bread recipes, and it amazes me when I come across one that is even better then my favorite recipe at the time.  When I saw the ratings for this recipe when I was searching for Christmas recipes, I had to give it a try. I am glad that I did. It is a big hit in my family! The sour cream is a nice addition that helps make the bread be so moist.  I love the idea of coating the pans with the cinnamon sugar (I added some on top as well). I halved the recipe since I only had 3 bananas (I used 2 large eggs) and I still had enough batter to make 4 mini loafs. My baking time was decreased to 40 minutes using the smaller pans. Use soft or melted butter to ease in mixing. Added a layer of cinnamon sugar to the middle of loafs. Put l/2 of batter in pan sprinkle with cinnamon sugar and then add the second half of batter. Topped with sugar crystals. Beautiful loafs of bread!  Great gift idea!

This bread is AWESOME! So easy to make and super moist! I gave 3 of the loaves away and people keep commenting on how good it is. The only thing I changed was I only used 2 cups sugar, and it was plenty sweet. I had a lot of the dusting cinnamon & sugar mix left over, so I sprinkled it on top of each loaf before baking (idea from another review), I think this really added to the sweet cinnamon flavor. So yummy! I will definitely be making this again in the NEAR future!

This is the best ever - wish I could give it 6 stars! I halved the recipe for 5 mini loaves, baked at 325 for 45 minutes. I used 4 bananas, 2 eggs, 2 tsp vanilla, and 1 c. toasted chopped walnuts. Also used the topping mentioned in another review (1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 c flour, 3 T butter, 1 t cinnamon and 1/3 c walnuts). The topping really put this recipe over the top!!

Was not sure how it would turn out, but when my husband ate about 1/2 of one loaf in a days time, that told me right there it was good.  The only probelm I had was when I took the advise of one person and put a strudel topping on.  It made it taste great, but I guess I put too much on it and it soaked into the middle which made it kind of doughy like while it was still warm.  After it cooled off completely, it was fine.  All in all, my husband is ready for me to make it again asap!

It's really a yummy recipe!  I modified by: substituting butter with 1 cup oil; reduced vanilla extract to 1 teaspoon & added 1 teaspoon banana extract; reduced baking soda to 2 teaspoons & added 1 teaspoon baking powder; reduced flour to 3 1/2 cups.  Bake at 325 degrees for 1-1 1/2 hours (or until toothpick comes away clean from center).  Immediately cover with foil while cooling & it will be really moist.

This recipe is excellent.  The cinnamon sugar "crust" is great.  The recipe really does make a huge amount of batter... almost too much for a kitchenAid mixer bowl!  The only issue I have is that the size loaf pans called for are very scarce.  So you are kind of on your own as to the size of pan and baking time.  I made 1 9x5, 1 8x4, and a pan of mini loaves.  The large one cooked (at 325) for almost an hour and a half, the smaller one for about an hour and twenty minutes, and the mini loaf pan cooked about an hour.  I filled all of them to about an inch below the top of the pan.  Other than that confusion... this was an excellent, moist, flavorful recipe.  You can add extras like raisins, craisins, different nuts- whatever you like.  Don't skip dusting the cinnamon sugar on the pans.  Not only does it taste good, but it also helps the baked loaves come right out easily.  Try this!

Oh My Goodness... this is even better the next day!  Try it with cream cheese.

this is my favorite banana bread recipe.  I make it all the time, my favorite part about it is that it makes 4 loaves, my boys love banana bread and usually polish off a loaf as soon as I cut it up.  I love the cinnamon-sugar idea, I've made them with the c-s mixture on the bottom and on the top of the loaves and it's good both ways, I've also forgotten to put it on entirely and that works too.  It does freeze well, one day I had a ton of bananas and no one was eating them, ended up making a dozen loaves - had to freeze some, and give some away.

Very good!  This will replace my recipe I have been using for years. I replaced the butter with 1/4 cup butter flavored shortening, 1/4 cup applesauce & 1/4 cup canola oil.  Very moist and made 2 large beautiful loaves.  I cooked them at 325 for about 1 hr 20 min and covered them with foil sprayed with cooking spray for last 20 minutes.  Also, added walnut pieces to batter before baking.  Yummy!

WOW!  I read all the other reviews and had to try it.  This bread is so perfect.  It's moist, sweet but not too sweet, and just wonderful.  Pay attention to the loaf pan size.  I thought it was calling for 4 regular sized pans but they are mini loaf pans.  I halved it thinking it would make way to much.  If you do use two regular sized pans, the cooking time was about 15 to 20 minutes longer.  This is one I will definitely keep and share!

This is the best banana bread I've ever had.  Even my husband loved it, and he "doesn't like" banana bread.  I followed all of the suggestions made by SaraLady19, including adding the crumbly topping she suggested.  I used "lite" sour cream, a healthier "lower fat" butter and pecans in the place of walnuts.  I made 48 muffins from the recipe.  I baked them at 325 degrees for just over 20 minutes.   My nutritional information on each muffin is 178 calories, 6 grams of fat, and 1 gram of fiber.

Wow! I've been making various recipes of banana bread forever, but this one is a cut above the rest! I like the fact that it uses butter rather than shortening.  I put a few mini chocolate chips in one loaf for fun.  This caused some family drama - some members trying to keep others from eating the bananas before they went ripe because they wanted me to make this again!

This recipe is definitely a keeper! I followed the recipe exactly, but omitted the walnuts. The result was super! Moist and delicious, it has such a wonderful banana flavor. This recipe produced two loaves and ten muffins. Needless to say, they were gobbled up within the next couple of days.

Unbelievable!  Everybody asked for the recipe.  The only trouble I had was that I didn't have the same size baking dishes required for the recipe.  So, I improvised with a traditional banana bread baking dish and a mini loaf pan (oh, and I HALVED THE RECIPE, TOO).  I watched my bread like a hawk so that it would not burn or over cook.  I wanted the perfect bread...it is worth the time and effort :)  Thank you.

Thank you Esther,  This is wonderful and I did just as you suggested and gave some loaves as gifts this past holiday.  The only thing I did differently was to use white and brown sugar, 1 1/2 cups of each.  I have made another batch and have 1 loaf in the freezer for us later.  Yum Yum.... (a tip someone gave me years ago ~ freeze your brown bananas then when you bake defrost for about 3 minutes in the microwave or leave on the counter for a couple of hours- this really gives the bananas more sweetness and they are juicier in the recipes)

Pretty good, but not my favorite banana bread recipe.  I made three large loaves with this recipe.  Probably would have added more bananas - to give it more banana flavor.  (As it was I used 7.)  Liked the idea of adding sour cream to give it a different flavor.  Might try this again, but will keep looking for that perfect banana bread recipe.

Oh, my goodness, I am throwing away all my other banana bread recipies, and using only this one from now on. So moist, so full of flavor, oh my so good. I halved the recipie, and used 2 eggs (when you half it it calls for 1 1/2 eggs). I also threw in a dash of nutmeg, and put a crumb topping of cinnamin, butter, brown sugar, flour and walnuts on top before baking. i am going back for my second piece now..excuse me

This is by far the best Banana Bread recipe I have ever tried - and I love Banana Bread, so I have made it alot.  I've made it several times now, and have used different nuts (macadamia nuts were awesome) and always taste the bananas I use prior to adding the sugar.  The last time I made it my bananas, while over-ripe, just weren't very sweet.  So I did use the full amount of sugar in the recipe, and it turned out absolutely delicious!  So it definately rates 5 stars; great just as the recipe reads, and also lends itself beautifully to changes.  I have added different spices, also ... it never fails to be a huge hit.  I freeze extra loaves, and now have to actually hide them in the freezer to prevent family (and friends!) from digging it out and eating it!  Thanks for a PERFECT recipe!

This was great! I only had 2 bananas to use, so I 1/3ed the recipe. I made a few changes to make it a bit more healthy: I replaced the butter with unsweetened applesauce, I used fat free sour cream and white wheat flour. Instead of a loaf I made 12 large muffins. Yum!

This is about as awesome as it gets.  The wife hates nuts so since this recipe yields us two nice size loaves ( 2 9x5 loaf pans ) one is without nuts and still is awesome.  I am always being asked by others for the recipe.   Thanks for the hit!!!!!

fantastic!  I halfed the recipe (using 2 eggs and 4 bananas-- 2 of the bananas weren't quite "overly ripe") and baked in 2 loaf pans for 1 hour and 10 minutes at 300 degress, turned out perfect.

This was so good, very moist  I did make a few changes to make it a little better for you.  I cut the recipe in half to only make 2 loaves so all changes apply to that.  I used 1/4 cup applesauce and 2 tbsp of butter in place of all the butter, 2 eggs, and only 1 cup of sugar.  Next time I think I could cut down on the sugar even more and take out the butter completely.  I followed the advice another reviewer gave and baked it at 325 for 1 hour.  TFS

This bread was very yummy!  Very moist and tender, and stayed that way after a few days too.  My girls devoured it!  The one thing I would change is that I didn't care for the cinnamon/sugar coating on the sides from the pan dusting - it made for a crunchy-type crust because it seemed to carmelize a bit for me.  I prefer my bread to be soft all over, so this was not an appropriate addition for me.  Perfect for someone who likes a bit of crunch in their bread though!

This was my first banana bread try and it was really good! (Too good really, I ate the whole loaf to myself in three days! ) I halved the sugar and replaced it with unsweetened apple sauce. Too much sugar for my taste. The only thing that didn't really work out was that it didn't raise very well...I don't know if it's because of the apple sauce..or maybe because I poked it a few too many times with a fork (I know you're not supposed to do that but it smelled soo good..and I couldn't wait to try it. :P)

I had bananas in the freezer, and sour cream a day past its 'best before' date, so I decided to try this recipe. This was the best banana bread I've ever made! So moist and the flavour was just right. I don't have 4 loaf pans, so I made 2 loaves and a bundt cake. I used flax seed meal & water instead of eggs. I could take or leave the cinnamon-sugar coating, but my husband definitely liked it.

Wow, this bread is great! I live alone (and only had 2 bananas), so I made 1/4 the recipe to end up with 1 loaf. It turned out so much more moist than other banana breads I have made and was delicious! My plan was to give half the loaf to a friend, but after the first piece I decided there was no way I was sharing! =)

Holy Moly!  I will never make another banana bread recipe again!  This is so good that I seriouslu could eat the whole loaf right now.  Wow.  The cinnamon and sugar coating on the pan makes a delicious crispy glaze all over the bread - so add some to the top before baking too.  Mmmmmm.  
I only have 1 9 x 3 1/2 bread pan and a pan that makes 8 mini loaves, so I cut the recipe in half, which made 1 big loaf plus 4 mini loaves.  Since my pan was bigger than the one called for in the recipe I baked it for an hour and ten minutes, and the mini loaves for 25 minutes.  They came out perfect!  Thanks for my new banana bread recipe!

This is one of the best banana bread recipes I have used.  I added some cinnamon and a little allspice to give it some added kick.  I have already made this numerous times and my kids don't eat the bananas knowing that this banana bread is made when the bananas get ripe.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I baked this in two 9X5 pans (since I didn't have the smaller size) and it took FOREVER, but it was very good.  The first loaf was good, but the second loaf, which had been wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for a few days, was excellent!  Very very moist.  Not a huge fan of cinnamon in banana bread, but the texture was great.

I'm editing my original review from 2004 when I rated this recipe 4 stars. I think with less sugar it is very deserving of  stars. I only use 1 1/2 cups of sugar and it is still super sweet. This is honestly the best banana bread recipe out there!

There are lots of banana bread recipes, but the best ones make sure the bread is moist.  This was FINALLY my first successful attempt at a moist and delicious banana bread.  I halved the recipe and used one of the pans that make 4 mini-loaves.  I started watching the bread after 40 minutes, and pulled it out around 45-50 minutes (toothpick came out clean).  I used Tillamook fat-free sour cream, and dusted the tops with confectioners' sugar.  Even though I used fat-free sour cream, the loaves came out really moist.  I brought a loaf to work, and it was gone in 1/2 hour.  Great recipe!!

Very moist and delicious. I've made it twice in two weeks. The first time I did it exactly as it calls, and it was delicious. Second time I tried making it a bit healthier using whole wheat flour, half brown sugar and yogurt instead of sour cream. Was still delicious.

This is absolutely the best banana bread I have ever had.  The only substitute I made was to add pecans instead of walnuts.  It makes 3 large loaves which didn't last very long in our house.

Just as wonderful as everyone here says it is! I had to cover the top with foil the last few minutes of baking so it didn't over-brown on the top. And I made it in 3 9x5 pans and just let it bake longer. Everyone at this house agrees it will become our "standard" banana bread recipe from now on.

I found this to be a sweet, very moist cake-like bread. Other reviews felt the bread improved in flavor over night. No noticable change for us. The reason for the reviewers who enjoyed this whom did not like bananas, is because it has VERY LITTLE BANANA flavor. For us, Its all about the banana flavor. This MISSES the banana mark.

This recipe was very good However it was too moist and heavy. I greased the pans well and coated them with the combination of cinnamon and sugar.  The bottom of the bread stuck to the pans, I wonder if anyone else had that problem.  If I make it again I will not coat the pans.

This is the 2nd recipe ive made from this web site. 5 stars for a perfect recipe. I also think 5 stars should go to all those who made it and very kindly shared their tips which made mine mouth wateringly perfect.I too reduced the sugar. Baked mine in a pyrex loaf dish and had no problem with it rising.It took 1 hour 20 mts tho.Cant wait to try something else now.

this recipe is easy and tastes great.  i substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream and next time i'll cut the sugar back by a cup (it was a little too sweet for me).

I hate to be the bad guy, but I was not impressed with this recipe. It has its pluses, which is why it got a three. It is a relatively light banana bread. Most banana bread recipes are very heavy and dense. This one cooks up light, which is nice. What I didn't like, was the cinnamon in the batter. I love cinnamon, but it overpowered the banana taste. If I decide to try this recipe again, I will not put any cinnamon in the batter. I will, however, put the cinnamon/sugar mixture on the bottom of the pan and on the top of the batter. That would be all the cinnamon I would want. I guess I am used to banana bread tasting like banana, and I didn't find that the case in this bread.

I don't usually leave reviews, but this bread deserves five stars and more.  I've made this numerous times and always am asked for the recipe.  My mother-in-law has always been known for her banana bread, but last week she declared me the "Queen of Banana Bread".  I especially like to make the little loaves and give them to family and co-workers--they rave!!

I had to leave a review b/c it made the VERY BEST banana bread!!  I did make some changes, took others advice and cut sugar to 2 1/2 c sugar, used white/whole wheat blend flour,wheat bran and wheat germ to make the 4 1/2 c flour then added 1 tsp baking powder since some had said it was alittle too dense/didn't seem to cook all the way through.  It came out perfect and sooo delicious.  The recipe made 5 smaller loaves and 12 muffins.

Really good bread!  I used a little less sugar than called for and also used whole wheat flour.  It turned out moist and very tasty.  My husband raved.

I had 1 1/2 black bananas and didn't know what to do with them.  I scaled the recipe down to one loaf and it produced a beautifully light, moist bread.  Used 1 whole egg and 1 tsp. soda when scaling down to the 1 loaf.  I made a 'sample' muffin to review, and stuck the loaf in the freezer.

This is definately the best banana bread I have ever had!!!! The second time I used this recipe, I reduced the sugar to 2 cups, and it was still very, very good. We try to watch our kids sugar intake.

This is the yummiest banana bread. I added an extra banana. It turned out beautifually moist with a wonderful flavour. It took about 1 hour and 20 mins in the oven - longer than the recipe stated.

These were good, but as usual made some small changes. I made into muffins & didn't dust tins with sugar. I cut the sugar in half & added 1/2cup dark chocolate mini chips.
My second time making these. Again cut the sugar in half & decided I didn't want to add any butter, instead I used 1/2 cup cooked yam, 1/4 cup apple sauce and an extra banana. I forgot the nuts. These were awesome, big,soft and flavourful ;)

I scaled down the recipe for one loaf and truly wish I would have made four! This banana bread was moist and delicious, the best I've made by far. The only change I made was replacing the walnuts with pecans. Will make again and again. Thanks Esther for sharing this truly five star recipe.

I cut down the recipe to a third (11 servings), used 2/3 cup sugar instead of 1 cup, used reduced-fat sour cream, added one roughly chopped banana with the nuts (pecans instead of walnuts) and baked in one 9X5 loaf pan for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Delicious.

This is THE banana bread recipe.  I made 6 mini loafs and one big loaf and cooked them for about 50 minutes and they came out sooooo good.  It's a good recipe for the holidays because it makes so much and then you can give some away.

Wonderful! This is one of the tastiest banana breads I've ever made (and I've tried a lot!) Just the right ammount of nuts, cinnamon, vanilla, everything. I made mine in two 9 by 5 inch loaf pans and they were perfectly done after an hour and 40 minutes.  I only had 4 ripe bananas on hand and that worked just fine.  Thanks for this recipe, it's wonderful!!

This bread is fabulous! I substituted 1 cup brown sugar for one of the white, omitted the nuts and added some flour dusted mini chocolate chips, and used Mexican vanilla (a wonderfully spicy vanilla). Cooking time for me was a little over an hour in a Pampered Chef bread pan. The bread was wonderful right out of the oven but even better the next day. I usually make the Banana Banana bread on this site but I may replace it with this recipe. I found this one to be just as wonderful in flavor and moistness but not quite as sweet. Can't wait to eat the loaf I stuck in the freezer!

I followed this recipe exactly (which is a first for me)...and I LOVED it.  Very moist and flavorful.  My favorite touch is the cinnamon sugar-crust.  Very tasty.  Will definitely make it again!

I have been using my Aunt's banana bread recipe for 25 years, but am now using this one!  I like that it makes a lot--with 5 kids, it's nice to put some in the freezer and pull it out when I need a quick snack.  Great for bake sales too!

This banana bread was moist and delicious.  What really made this bread stand out though was the cinnamon sugar coating.  Usually, I end up tossing the ends of the bread, but on these loaves, people were fighting for them!  The recipe makes a lot, but trust me, it will disappear quickly.

I made this bread early in the day, and when I came home from a meeting, I saw that my husband had beaten me home with a smile on his face.  He had eaten a whole mini loaf!  Needless to say, we both loved this recipe.

The recipe was, by far, the best banana bread I have ever tasted. It was very light - almost cakelike, and the cinnamon sugar added just the perfect touch. I've made this recipe several times, and each time I get consistent and tasty results. It also freezes really well!

I have been looking for a good banana bread recipe for a while now.  Was my husband ever glad I found this one.  Thank you!  I noticed another person wrote that it took 1 & 1/2 hours to cook; I'm wondering if she didn't do what I did and use 2 standard sized loaf pans instead of the 7x3 loaf pans the recipe called for since that is exactly how long it took mine.  P.S. The sugar & cinnimon dusting was a nice touch.

HOLY COW!  I made this recipe in mini-loaf aluminum pans and I got 12 loaves!  My 2 year old daughter ate almost a whole loaf all on her own.  This moist and delicious bread is better the 2nd day...I will never search for another recipe for banana bread!  Thank you SO much for sharing your precious secret! - Jenn

This was my first try at banana bread, and it turned out absolutely, without a doubt, DELICIOUS!  Despite the fact that it's the first banana bread recipe I've tried... I think from now on it's my ONLY banana bread recipe!!  I messed up a little bit when I was mixing everything together, but it still came out wonderful (and a forgiving recipe is always a nice thing).  This recipe is extremely easy, and a fast clean-up (which is also very nice!).  It's a great way to use all those bananas that you *thought* you'd end up eating.  If you haven't tried this recipe, you're missing out on something amazing.

The taste was great, more cake-like the bread-like. But i have a big Kitchen-aid mixer and it was filled to the brim, be prepared with a Large bowl to mix with. Also I had to cook mine almost 20 mins longer, and still the insides could have been done more..but it was worth it in the end. ;-)

Alright...I'm now part of the thousands of reviewers who thought this was the best bread out there! If you're reading this, you probably know that some changes made this bread outstanding. I halved the recipe and baked in 7 1/2 x 9 inch loaf pans at 325 degrees for 1 hour and 10 minutes. I also added a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon to the filling. But the best change of all was following another reviewer's advice by adding a crumb topping: ½ cup packed brown sugar, ½ cup all-purpose flour, 2 or 3 tablespoons butter, melted, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/3 cup chopped pecans. Best banana bread I ever made...ask my family who has had to endure very mediocre or underdone banana bread for years!

I have made this recipe  for the past 6 years and I can not give it more than 5 stars or I would!! I have never met anyone  who  didn't think this is the best version they have ever eaten  even  if  they don't like sour cream  just don't tell them before lol and trust me they would never know. The sour cream  is not strong or over powering  at all. I love banana bread but hate the usual bitterness most of them have to them. The addition of sour cream takes that away and you are left with a amazing  flavor of banana. Also the sour cream  adds that extra moisture  most breads lack this bread always makes 5-6 loafs  for me which is perfect for giving at Christmas time an when I have extra they keep for almost 2 weeks wrapped in foil. I hate having to eat everything  so fast then you get burned out on it. The only thing I do differently is I add the vanilla and cinnamon last  I go by smell because  I want the batter to still have  the  banana  smell as well as the vanilla  and  cinnamon, so as I add a little bit of each, I smell above the mixer as its going so I get the aroma from the mixing process to know when I have added  the  right amount for my family. My daughter who cannot make anything poor kid I taught her this method and she was amazed because she never knew that was what I was doing. My kids love the batter left in the bowl just as much as the bread. OK now that I have rambled enough about this bread im off to start making my Christmas batches.

I have made this banana bread many,  many times for my #1 fan, the hubby, who regularly says it is the best he has ever had!! That after almost 70 years of trying different recipes!!!
I now make 4 loaves at a time and freeze some, wrapped in freezer paper (so top does not peel off upon opening it) and plastic. Loaves given out to friends yields frozen banana donations to encourage this baker to keep-it-coming!!! 
Changes: 350 degree oven for 50-60 minutes
                     4 tsp baking soda
                      1 tsp nutmeg added
                       1 TBSP vanilla
                        2 cups walnuts ( pecans weren't 'right' per hubby)
I cream the sugar and butter till very well blended and fluffy then cream in the eggs; with mixer on low speed I add banana- vanilla mixture then sour cream and while still running slow mixer I spoon the flour /baking soda/ salt mixture in. Stir in walnuts before distributing to well sugared ( w/cinnamon mixture) loaf pans. 
Anyone have some frozen bananas for me? 
Perfect!!! Four more loaves in the oven now.

This recipe was a hit with my husband!  I made a few adjustments, based on what I had in the cupboard. For sugar I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown for the added flavor.  I upped the cinnamon for a little extra zing. Also, I had assembled the entire batter and realized I didn't have enough sour cream, so I used vanilla yogurt instead.  It still came out beautifully.

Great, moist recipe--needed to bake for 1 hr to 1 hr & 20 min at 325 deg-F.  Since I used different sized pans, and since I put all 4 pans in at the same time, my breads came out at varying times.  Used frozen bananas (weight of 2 frozen bananas is 7.25 oz with the banana "juice", so multiply by 3 to scale this up to 6 banana recipe) and macadamia nuts since that was all I had.  Also added a dash of cloves and nutmeg to the batter and to the cinnamon/sugar lining.  I tasted the batter before baking and I was really afraid that the bread was going to be too sweet.  But it turned out perfectly in every regard.  Immediately after I barely mixed in the dry ingredients, I popped the pans into the oven.  The bread rose enough such that the batter overflowed, so be careful not to fill the batter to the brim.

not every cooking endeavor can end in triumph.. bf says not to expect everything to go perfect.. i think i just need to stick to muffins.. anyway, i started out by cutting this down to 8 servings to make one loaf.. i decided to cook this in my little conventional toaster oven.. and that was were this went south.. about 45 minutes in bf noticed the top was burning.. so we took it out.. cut off the top and put it into the regular oven.. it's been about 40 minutes and i'm tired of trying to make it work.. it does taste good and i said we'll just put whatever slices we decide to eat in the microwave.. i didn't do the dusting of the sugar and cinnamon.. i used greek yogurt for sour cream.. half margarine and half applesauce.. and slivered almonds for the walnuts.. i'd like to say maybe there will be a next time but i'm just frustrated at this point

Incredible even at high altitude!!!!!! I halved the recipe using 3 bananas and 2 eggs.  Baked at 325 for about an hour and half. (Checked at an hour and then again every 5 mins until my toothpick came out clean.) Made one loaf. Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!

I read a lot of reviews saying that cooking at 300 for an hour wasn't enough, so I took some suggestions and cooked it at 325, but still needed to cook it an extra 15 minutes so it wasn't completely raw inside. Other than that the taste wasn't anything to get excited about. I did add an extra banana just in case, but my husband and I just thought "just another banana bread recipe." There is seriously nothing exciting about this. We prefer Janet's Rich Banana Bread Recipe over this one hands down.

This is a great tasting banana bread recipe and so moist!  I had used the same banana bread recipe for years that was handed down to me by my husband's grandmother until now.  I was searching for a recipe to use up a large quantity of sour cream and as a bonus found a recipe that would also use up overripe bananas.  I made the following changes:  1.  I don't care for cinnamon so I don't put it in the bread nor dust the pans with cinnamon and sugar.  2.  I substitute plain yogurt for the sour cream if that is what I have on hand.  3.  I use 3 pans instead of 4 pans.  4.  I upped the temperature to 325 degrees and baked it for another 15 minutes.  Turns out perfect every time!

I only had two bananas so I only made a third of the recipe. I also used only 3/4 of the sugar called for and used more chopped walnuts than suggested. I had enough batter for a small loaf and six muffins. Muffins were fully cooked at 30 minutes and are amazing.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out delicious! I might use a little less sugar next time, but my family still loved it. The only thing I altered was the cooking time, as a few others have said, I baked it on 300 for 1 hour but it was still completely raw. So I covered it with foil and baked it on 325 for 20 more minutes and it came out perfectly cooked and very moist. Can't wait to make it again!

This recipe should be a 5 star, but as written is closer to a 2 or 3. The recipe itself is sound, but the bake time is waaaay off.  300 degrees will give you a doughy (although delicious) mess. I bake at 325 for about an hour and they come out perfect! So moist.

This recipe was absolutely fantastic save for the cooking time. I found 1 hour at 300 degrees to be insufficient, so after the first hour I covered with foil and increased the temperature to 325 for an additional 20 minutes which resulted in a perfectly done loaf. This could have been the result of me baking in a cast iron loaf pan, but regardless it was a trivial issue that was easily gotten around. 

Additionally I added dried blueberries to the dough/batter which made it even more moist and awesome. I will definitely be making this again and it is my new go to banana bread recipe. :)

This is now my go to recipe for banana bread.  I chose to add the cup of nuts.  Like others, I baked in 2 larger loaf pans and upped the temp to 325.  After 1 hour they were nice and brown but yet not done in the center.  I turned the temp down slightly and placed a piece of foil across the top to keep them from burning on top.  Total bake time ended up at 1 hour 15 minutes.

Scrumptious! Had 3 containers of sour cream and a gallon freezer bag full of bananas to use up so searched for recipes and came up with this one.  Wish I hadn't listened to reviewers that cut the sugar, thought 3 Cups was a lot so I cut it to 1 3/4 Cups but it wasn't quite sweet enough. Next time I'll use 2 Cups. It did however have the perfect banana bread consistency, sliced wonderfully and had super banana flavor!  Making the full recipe I divided batter between two 9x5" pans and baked at 325 for an hour and 15 minutes...I did cover the loaves with foil at about 45 minutes in because they were quite browned already. Next time I think I'll also sprinkle the tops with the cinnamon sugar mixture, the crust was the best! Thanks for sharing a SUPER DELICIOUS recipe... this is my go to from now on!

I followed another persons comment of cut in half and cook at 325°. Came out perfect.  I had to use parchment paper, so I didn't get to add the extra cinnamon and sugar, but since I had to use up 4 bananas it was perfectly sweet.  Hubby said it was a keeper.  Considering I usually get the response, "Eh, it's filler" that is saying a lot!

I made this recipe yesterday and the bread is wonderfully moist, plus the cinnamon sugar makes a tasty crust. The next time, I might even sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top.
Since I only had 4 bananas I switched to 22 servings (love that feature of allRecipes!) for the best balance of ingredients. I made 2 loaves and like others found that the 300 degree setting left the bread still mushy in the center so I popped it up to 350 after the first hour. In about 15 minutes it was perfect - not burned and well baked inside.
The next time I might try 325 for the baking time. Either way, I will repeat this recipe and gave it only 4 stars due to the baking temp/time issue.

This bread was the best banana bread I've ever had. I gave half of the loaf to a friend and she said the same thing. I will make this every time my bananas become very ripe.

This recipe is almost PERFECT. The bread is very moist. It is a dense bread so slices like butter and isn't crumbly. I used pecans instead of walnuts, and I wanted a regular size loaf so I cut this recipe down to 1/3 and was the right size. I will make it again, but will cut the sugar down - it was a little on the sweet side. The sour cream is the secret!! Love it!

I hardly ever write reviews, usually because I just exit out and forget about doing it...BUT, this one was worth it! I made one batch and turned it into so many different flavors. Chocolate Chip Banana Bread, Chocolate Chip Walnut Banana Bread, Banana Walnut Bread, and just plain old FABULOUS Banana Bread! It makes so much and its fluffy and tasty, and everything you could ever imagine banana bread needs to be. I left the Cinnamon out of the actual recipe, but still used it for the lining and I think it was still great! I'm just not a huge cinnamon person. This is one recipe I'll pass on to friends and family!

One of the better quick bread recipes. Used 2 9 inch loaf pans. Took about 1 3/4 hrs. to bake. Foil on the top after 1 hr. Need "longer" toothpicks for the larger loaf pans. Pick came out clean but the bottom of the loaf wasn't completely cooked.

So moist and full of flavor, and the cinnamon sugar in the pan adds a extra yum factor!  I sprinkled the left over cinnamon sugar on top before baking!!!

This is a huge recipe! I had a bunch of ripe bananas on hand so just made the whole recipe. I only have one loaf pan. So I yielded one giant loaf of bread and 24 muffins. Don't be too shy when filling the pans because this recipe lifts really nicely. My husband loved it! Neither of us thought it was too sweet and he's sensitive to things being really sweet. The recipe is denser than a cake but lighter than most breads. The only change I made was add 1/2 tsp rack of nutmeg and cloves. Gave a spicy essence. Oh I also use the crumb topping from the zucchini bread on this site. Very good! The recipe is a keeper!

Loved it..I cut recipe in half. Used half butter and half cup applesauce.  Used one loaf pan and 10 cupcakes. Cooked cupcakes at 325 for 30 min. Perfect.  Loaf took the entire hour.

Just had my first slice from the batch I just made.  FANTASTIC!  Using hints from others I used 2 cups of mashed bananas but made no other ingredient changes.  I made 8 mini loaves, (the smaller foil pans you get at the market - about 3x5.5.)  Using a digital kitchen scale, I put about 11 oz. into each pan. (pan weighs .4 oz. so you get about 11.4 oz. total per pan.) Baked at 325 for about 55 min.  BE WARE - this recipe makes a LOT of batter.  Make sure you have a large bowl. (I wound up using a stock pot.)  :)

This is the best banana bread recipe ever! Everyone raves about it and asks for some. I have been making this recipe for about 9 months now. I have only ever had one loaf fail. I use 3 8X4 inch bread pans and it fills them perfectly. I also measure out exactly 2 cups of bananas for the recipe and I cook the bread at 325 for about an hour and 15 minutes and it is perfect every time. I also add 1/4 teaspoon of all spice and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg to the recipe. I too find that I have to cover it for the last 15 min to avoid over browning the top. My only failure was the very first batch I made.I used larger loaf pans and tried cooking at 300 degrees per the recipe. I opened the oven at about 50 min to check on it and see it's progress and the loaves caved in. I learned from that mistake! Higher temp, smaller pans, consistency on amount bananas. Too little or too much banana can make a difference and 6 large bananas is pretty vague. 2 cups was the magic number! Sometimes it takes 6 bananas and sometimes 8 bananas to make 2 cups...

I have tried dozens of banana bread recipes over the past 25 years and this is my favorite. What makes it special is the moistness (from the sour cream) and the sugar/cinnamon coating, which I would never have thought to use with banana bread. My kids were fighting over who go the butt of the bread!

I made this recipe for the first time about a year ago…I lost my copy of this recipe and recently found it again.  My family LOVES this banana bread recipe more than any other one I've used.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.

Best banana bread ever!!! I baked it for 1hr and 5 mins at 300F and it came out awesome!! I made half the recipe with the following changes: 
1) one stick salted butter 2) 2 eggs 3) 3.5 ripe bananas 4) slightly less than one cup sugar 5) 2tsp vanilla. It was moist and yummy!! Oh and I didn't have sour cream in hand, so I used 1cup full cream+1tablespoon lemon juice. So good!!

The best banana bread recipe in the whole world.  I half the recipe and only make one loaf in a 9x13 pan, cook for 325 for 90 minutes, and it's done! Gets better after a day or 2 so try and keep from eating it straight out of the oven.

I always thought my banana bread was the best and would often 'show off' by making it. Nope. This one is the best!!! I agree with one of the gals, I add the crumble topping and that makes ALL THE DIFFERENCE!!!

We've made this receipe several times now, cutting the recipe in 1/2 using 3-4 bananas, depending on size and 2 eggs.  We also add about 1 1/2 cups of mini chocolate chips.  It is very moist and delicious and my 5 year old is always excited when it's time to make a new batch!

I loved this recipe.  For those who had trouble with cooking time you may want to check the temperature on your oven.  Ours is accurate and one hour was perfect.  

I'm rating this recipe on it's "as written" product.  I used my kitchen aid mixer on a low speed for the entire process.  What I got was a nice consistency delicious bread.  Even my husband loved it..enough that he's taking a loaf to work tonight to share!!!

I have to say that it drives me nuts when people rate a recipe and then list how they changed the entire thing.  But that's just me!  

If you are looking for a nice simple banana bread this is the one you want!!!

I cut in half and baked in an 11.5 x 5 pan that was my grandmother's - excellent bread - baked at 325 for an hour plus a little...people who said their bread didn't turn out - common sense should prevail here - if you're going to make a larger loaf than originally called for, obviously you must turn up the temp and increase the time!!  Happy Baking    :)

Great recipe. I didn't have quite enough sour cream, so I used about 1 cup of sour cream and 1 cup of creamy peanut butter. The result was delicious! I also made them into muffins instead of loaves. The recipe made 36 regular size muffins and 6 jumbo muffins. I also stirred some semi-sweet chocolate chips into the last half of the batter. I did not use the cinnamon and sugar mixture to coat the pans with, but I did sprinkle some coarse sugar on top of the muffins prior to baking.

used almonds instead of walnuts, and yoghurt instead of sour cream. It did take longer to bake than recipe calls for (as noted by DLPALMA), but it is still very good, especially toasted in the morning!

I made this recipe to contribute to an event and everyone LOVED it. There were people coming up for seconds and thirds. It is the moistest banana bread you will ever taste. The lady next to me at the event made banana bread, too (d'oh!), and mine was far nicer. I highly recommend this recipe!

3,000 people aren't wrong about this one.  This is some seriously good banana bread.  It makes a ton!  But don't worry about it going to waste.  People have no trouble eating it.  I'm wanting to make more just thinking about it.  My favorite breakfast of the year.  I think the only problem I ran into with the recipe was that my mixing bowl was barely big enough.  Will not alter the recipe.

I cut the recipe in half to make two loafs instead of the four. I used 2 eggs not 1 1/2. Taste really good.

My husband and I loved it!! We did it exactly as it is in the recipe. It wasn't cook in an hour but, since we weren't in a hurry, we left it in the oven for 25 more minutes and it was perfect. Definitely doing this again! Thank you for sharing.

I'm in love!  I don't even love banana bread that much...but when one has really ripe bananas...you have to do something with them.  I had to cook a little longer (about 20mins) but worth the wait!  AMAZING!!!

AMAZING!!! The sour cream is the secret ingredient. I bought the wrong size pans so I made 3 from the recipe. I've never baked anything, so I didn't realize how much it would rise. The result was a "muffin-top" loaf but the taste was amazing. I cooked it longer - until the toothpick (in this case a skewer) came out clean. Oh my, it was fabulous. I did add a topping recommended by one of the top reviewers - delicious. I didn't have quite enough walnuts - next time I'll add more. Overall, it was easy, inexpensive, and most of all - DELICIOUS!

This bread is soooo good and it even freezes well!  I like to bake things for breakfast in advance that I can just take out of the freezer the night before.  I'd much rather do that than buy pre-packaged breakfast food items.  This bread really does the trick and tastes exactly as it does before freezing....love it!

I made this bread this afternoon.  It turned out absolutely wonderful.  So moist and delicious and the fact that it made 4 loaves was even better.  Two loaves for the freezer.  I will be taking this to my church for the coffee hour.

After reading all those 5 star reviews I can hardly believe we were using the same recipe. I thought 300 degrees was too low to properly cook this bread, but I followed the recipe exactly.  It was very heavy and dense, and I had to increase the baking time by an additional 35 minutes to get it done. I liked the idea of the sour cream and banana together, but I won't be making this recipe again.

5+++++++!! My mom used to make banana bread for us as kids on a regular basis so I'm always reluctant to try other recipes since hers has always been my favourite - none of them can even compare with my mom's. I'd have to say that this recipe is better (sorry mom lol). This is going to be my new banana bread recipe!! I made then into square cupcakes for easy individual servings (made 1/2 the recipe & got about 18 "cupcakes"). I even added some chocolate chips to some. I made these last night and there are only 5 left this morning!!! ***DO NOT FORGET the dusting of cinnamon & sugar on the pan this adds such wonderful flavours!!!!! Although my husband and I are on an eating healthy mission so next time I'm going to try some of the other reviewers suggestions to make this lower fat.  UPDATE: I made this with low fat sour cream and I noticed quite a difference. Will use regular next time. I also tried a "crumble" topping on one of the loaves (1/4 cup packed brown sugar, 1/4 cup flour, 2 Tbsp softened butter, 1/4 tsp salt. Mix all together until it's crumbly). This was good but I'm a huge lover of the sticky top of banana bread (sometimes I just eat the top and give my husband the rest) so for me I prefer this without - personal preference. Others said they prefer the crumble. This is the first time I made these in "regular size" loaves (not sure if that was the diff) and I noticed that the colour toward the top of the loaf was different than the bottom. Although still delicious.

Pay attention to the loaf sizes. When it says 7"x3" loaves, they're not kidding, although it made six loaves, not four. One hour at 300 degrees was perfect for the size specified. The insides were cooked perfectly and there was no thick, dry crust on the outside like I typically get with quick breads. VERY moist. I made the bread exactly as stated. I skipped the cinnamon-sugar topping and instead made a glaze of confectioner's sugar, a little orange juice and zest to pour over the bread and it was fantastic. I will keep this recipe on heavy rotation. UPDATE: Makes terrific muffins too! 15-18 minutes at 300 degrees!

Excellent! I made half the recipe - it made 1 full loaf and 1/2 loaf in full size plans (the 1/2 loaf was just skinny). Used 2 T. butter and 1/4 cup cinnamon applesauce and low fat sour cream and less cinnamon.  I beat the eggs and other liquids alot, then mixed the dry ingredients in gently. I think this made the bread light and delicious. Next time I will add less sugar for health reasons, but thought the full amt. did not make it too sweet. Adding nuts would have put this over the top, but I didn't have any on hand. This recipe was just as good as the buttermilk version which I usually make. I always sub cinnamon applesauce for the oil and it's great! Also, baked the big loaf at 325 for about 50 minutes.

I cut the recipe in half. I got one and a half loaves. It was NOT done at 325 for 1 hour so I covered with foil and uped to 350 for 15 minutes. Very good. Not as fluffy as the Janet's rich banana bread.

I would give this 5 but that's so deceitful when the recipe has the incorrect temperature. That's a pretty big deal. With a 325 oven it's a 5 star but if you cook it too low it's a 1 :) I omit the walnuts because the kids don't like them and swap in some mini-chocoalte chips sprinkled in and on top of the loaf. Yum! Also, it taste just about the same with half the sugar when you add the chocolate chips. 
Other changes: I use coconut oil since I like the flavor it gives. I use plain full-fat yogurt instead of sour cream.

Looking for a banana bread worth gift giving, and came across this one. I made 3 9x5 loaves....about 1 hour 10 min. bake time. Also, hand mixed for a denser result. Topped each with another reviewer's topping suggestion of butter..brown sugar...cinnamon, nuts & flour...all I can say is WOW! May be my favorite recipe I've ever tried from this site. Moist, delicious cake. Bakes up beautifully. Proud to give these as gifts! Thanks for sharing this!

I am always looking for "the best of" recipes and this is definitely it! Best banana bread recipe ever! We omit the walnuts (due to allergies) and add a cup of milk chocolate chips instead...they have to be milk chocolate, semi sweet does not do in this recipe...Also as per someone else's review, you need to put the foil on in the last 20 minutes or so of baking, or the bread will be burnish on the sides. Make this when company is coming and then they'll spread the word and keep coming :) Thanks for sharing this recipe :)

I tried this recipe today and was REALLY impressed with the delicious result!  My family loved it and this one will surely go into my favorite recipe box.  This made 2 large loaves, which I baked at 325 for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  EXCELLENT!

Made this 8/26/12 - made half the recipe and used 2 regular size bread pans.  Excellent but not enough banana flavor and I used 3 bananas.  Next time use 4 bananas for 1/2 the recipe.  Definitely dust the pan with sugar and definitely add the brown sugar/flour/butter topping.  Excellent!

I am making this recipe for the 2nd time this morning, and my husband and boys love it.   I did downsize the recipe to 16 servings....and did need to leave it in the oven longer to cook the inside.   All ovens can be slightly different, so best to check with a toothpick or knife as recommended, to be sure it comes out clean.   I don't care for nuts in bread, but my husband has requested I  try this with chocolate chips added next time.  Sounds yummy, but I will try to see if I can cut down on the sugar.   Guess it's time to experiment ;).

Delicious banana bread. My friend actually accused me of including "crack or something else equally addictive" into the mix. My only fault is that I didn't realize how *large* the recipe was! It would be perfect for baking up gift loaves at Christmas but next time I will be cutting it in half (or even in fourths!).

I feel I have made my share of banana bread through the years and tried a variety of recipes, but that stops here! This was the most amazing banana bread I have ever made or eaten! The only thing I did different was add shredded coconut instead of nuts (next time I am using nuts as well). It made 6 mini loaves and 6 muffins. Cooking it at 300 degrees took almost exactly 1 hour. I can't wait to go buy more bananas so I can make more :o)

This is easy & delicious & makes a lot of bread! Everyone loves that it's so moist. I did use some of the substitutions to save calories (applesauce/greek yogurt/splenda) and it's still getting rave reviews!

This recipe did not work for m.  I made it following the directions explicitly, using 6 medium-sized bananas.  The only changes I made was to use 3 9X5 pans, however, and baked it at 325.  After 2 hours of baking time--yes, my oven temperature is correct--it was still doughy and much too sweet.

AMAZING banana bread! My friends ask me to make "my special banana bread" all the time! the sour cream makes it so moist and I love the sugar/cinnamon mixture that coats the pan. I've made it with and without walnuts and also with chocolate chips. Delicious!

Delicious and so moist!!!  This makes so much! I'd cut this recipe in half for a bread. I did the whole amount and made a loaf, 24 mini muffins, 6 regular sized muffins, and still had some batter left over!

I always halve this and it fits perfectly into 4 mini loaf pans.  I still bake all 4 mini loaves one full hour at 300 degrees and they come out perfect!
EVERYBODY freaks out at how good and moist this banana bread is!! Better than any Ive ever had!!

due to a lack of ingredients, I used 3/4c sour cream and 1/2 c applesauce. I also only had 3 3/4 cups of all purpose flour, so I used whole wheat to make up the difference. These are excellent- first time to use sour cream in banana bread- this is a keeper.

Very good followed it exactly like it said ... After reading the reviews I see some people do not follow directions on recipes they want to change it up first time out .. You really should follow the recipe exactly as it states all that sugar makes for the bread turning out yummy and no fat free sour cream would not work either ..

This was good! I cut the recipe in half and used it to make a single loaf, cooked in a 350 degree oven for about 60 minutes, until the outside was deep golden and a knife inserted in center came out clean.  I left out the sugar/cinnamon mixture because the recipe seemed sweet enough without it.  I used reduced fat sour cream and Irish butter.  A keeper!

This is a wonderful recipe, accurate measurements and perfect cooking time.  I cut the recipe in half, just in case we didn't like it as well as my old stand-by recipe.  My family of 4 inhaled the two loaves in one day...next time I will make the full recipe! (And this will replace my other recipe!)

I've made many different versions of banana bread, and this one was so fabulous that I am doing my first ever review on a recipe.  I did modify it somewhat as I don't care for overly sweet desserts, so change the amount of sugar to 1 1/4 cups, I think I would even reduce that more as the cinnamon sugar that you dust the pan with first already gives it sweetness.  I also put in crushed almonds rather than walnuts, but otherwise kept the ingriedients as indicated.  I baked it at 350 degrees for an hour and it was perfect!  Nicely browned and moist, and the crunch from that cinnamon sugar dusting gives the surrounding crust a nice texture.

I love this recipe, it is by far the best banana bread I have ever made.  I usually half the recipe and make two 9x5 loafs.  I also bake at 350 for 60 minutes.

I was hesitant to make this as I had no luck in making bananna bread in the past, but was not willing to give up, thankfully I found this recipe and it is so delicious, make exactly as the recipe states.  You will not be disapointed.  Thanks so much Esther.

This is the most delectable banana bread I have ever tasted!  I even used fat free sour cream, partial wheat flour, less sugar, 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/4 c. butter and it was still divine!  Ya gotta try it!!!

This is truly an awesome banana bread recipe!  My entire family loves this bread.  The only change I made was replacing one cup of white sugar with brown sugar.  Otherwise, made the recipe as is!

This was amazing! I'm not much of a baker but this was incredibly easy (especially since I did the whole thing in my food processor). It makes a perfect breakfast or snack. I ran out of AP Flour while making it so substituted 1 cup WW flour and you can't taste the difference. Instead of making 4 loaves, I baked it for 1 hour in a 9x13-inch pyrex. Delicious!

Not bad.  Really don't see it much different than the other banana bread recipe I use.  I did half the recipe (used 2 eggs and 4.5 bananas) plus I added a good amount of nutmeg.  Would alternate between this and my other recipe until I find the perfect one.

Absolutely lovely! Made it exactly as written with the exception of oven temp. Like others, I baked at 325. I made 12 muffins for my husbands work, they took 30 minutes. I also got a large 9 X5 loaf out of it. Baked it for just over an hour, also at 325 and covered with foil the last 25 minutes to prevent over browning the top. I also did not use an electric mixer, all by hand. I wanted the density another reviewer mentioned. After all, if you're going to add sour cream for the richness it provides, might as well go all the way. This is simply decadent! Thank you, Esther!

This banana bread is the best I've ever made!  My boyfriend and I loved it!  It will definitely become a part of my permanent recipe collection!  It is very sweet (but I love sweet breads), but the flavor is awesome!  Love the cinnamon and sugar dusted pans too!

This recipe is great! Super moist and delicious. I made 2 loaves as directed and added some fresh blueberries to the second 2. Great reviews for both but the blueberry loaves definitely went first. 

One complaint is that I did have to cook them a little longer than the recipe said at 300 degrees. It could just be the oven in my apartment though.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!  I have made it a couple of times now and every time, they turn out great!  I usually make muffins with this recipe (makes about 32) but I have also made full size loafs as well.  I follow the recipe exactly, except the last time I only had 1 cup of white sugar on hand, so I subbed brown sugar for the rest and they turned out just as good!  5 stars all the way!!

Beware cooking temps & times! I didn't read reviews and almost ended up with gooey bread. I had baked two loaves at 300F for an hour. Reading the reviews after the hour was up because the bread was still wet in the middle, I increased the temperature to 350F for 15 minutes and covered the tops of the bread with aluminum foil to prevent burning. It turned out delicious. Good luck!

That's some pretty tasty bread there! I followed the original recipe exactly except I made one 9x13 loaf that I baked at 325 degrees for 1 hour 20 mins. It came out perfect! 

I've never tried to cream such an uneven sugar to butter ratio before, and "cream" doesn't really describe the end product of this stage. What I did is softened the butter (sticks) in my had until they were super malleable, cut it into 1/8 cup chunks, and smeared it into the sugar with the back of a wide spoon before stirring. The end texture should resemble instant potato flakes (at least it did for me and turned out fine!). 

Next time I make this recipe, I'm going to experiment a bit - the taste is a little plain for three cups of white sugar! I'll probably do half white and half brown sugar next time and throw in some nutmeg and cloves for some extra zing. I would probably let the bananas ripen just a little more as well. 

Overall a very tasty recipe! The sour cream really gives it some moisture! And pretty simple to boot! I will definitely be making this recipe again!

I've made this twice now and loved it both time BUT have to say that i liked it slightly better the first time when I didnt use any nuts and only had half the amount of Sour Cream required.  Dont know if that made a difference the second time around but I'll half the Sour Cream again next time and skip the nuts and see what happens! Either way though - the best Banana Bread EVER!

I thought it was just ok. Maybe it's just that I prefer my banana bread to be very dense and soft, and this was more light and cake-like.

The best banana bread I've ever made! I baked at 300 degrees for one hour as the recipe calls for and the center was like jelly! (Although, I used 3 baking pans, not 4.) So after the initial hour, I baked for an additional 20 minutes at 450 degrees. It made the crust crispy without being hard as if it were stale and it left the center moist and yummy. A perfect loaf!

Just for the record, don't try and sub cream cheese for sour cream. I didn't check my new container of sour cream before I started and got half way through and realized my roommate had swiped half the container. So in desperation, I tried subbing half the sour cream with cream cheese ( 6oz sour cream, 6oz cream cheese). The loaves still didn't turn out horrible but certainly won't be using cream cheese again. With all the great reviews though, I can't wait to try this recipe again with all the correct ingredients.

This turned out incredible, as expected!!!  

I halved the recipe, and did nothing differently!

It's dessert, so remember, making things fat free and artificial takes the fun out of it :-)

I'm a college student, and I went to a potluck party with some good friends tonight.

I got everything that I needed for four loaves of this bread for $20, and it was a huge success! 

I have minimal cooking skills (happily working on them) and it was a very easy recipe to prepare.

I'll say though, 10 minutes of prep time? Are you joking?

What a fantastic recipe, thank you so much for sharing!

I tried to make this a little more "healthy" by substituting nonfat yogurt in place of the sourcream, and used one less cup of sugar, it turned out great!!!! Very moist!!! Yumm!

Awesome! So delicious! Normally I am not a big fan of very banana tasting goodies, but this recipe is SOOO good!! It made more batter than I expected as I was able to make 4 loaves in the slightly larger sized loaf pans. Also, I forgot to sprinkle the cinn/sugar on the  greased loaves, so I opted to sprinkle it a-top the batter just before I put them in the oven, and added a little more cinnamon to the mixture because I love it. Once sprinkled on top I swirled it with a knife. This makes the very top of the bread slightly moist as it bakes, so if you do this expect it to leave some moist crumbs when you do your toothpick check. This is really terrific, you should go for it! :-D

Fantastic, moist, dense and flavorful. Made 3 loaves in two days and handed out a couple recipes as a result! I cut the recipe in half the first time and the second loaf had crumbs left by that evening! Texture is not cake-like...more like a gourmet cafe slice and the topping really finishes it off. I lined my baking pans with parchment paper to help with a tendency to over bake as well as to get a clean loaf and nice presentation. The overhanging paper also 'secured' any loose topping but with pressing it into the batter just a bit, that wasn't a big problem. Even used frozen ripe bananas and it worked great.

I made the whole recipe with only 3 bananas and swapped out one cup of sugar for brown but followed everything else exactly.  I baked small loaves in stoneware pans and they turned out perfectly.  Was a little anxious about the 300 baking temp but it really worked out great. I didn't find these to be too sweet. Banana bread is supposed to be a treat! Would definitely make again.

Great recipe.  I only use 1/2 the recommended ow-fat sour cream and it's still a great recipe.  I don't bake often so I don't bother with the applesauce and other lowfat substitutions.  This is considered a treat.  And I love using cinnamon sugar for the pans - I've done this now with another banana bread recipe when I was out of sour cream for this one.

I guess I'm surprised by all the great reviews. I made this yesterday - using all of saralady19's suggestions and I didn't like it at all - not enough banana, taste was too firm/rubbery and in all not much flavor - maybe was a little overcooked but I pulled at 1hr which is less then everyone else is saying... 

I did 2 loaves and halved as everyone else, I used 2 eggs so maybe only 1? I also doubled the cinnamon leaving it at 2 tsp and vanilla and still not much flavor. We tossed it. Lots of other recipes out there like classic betty crocker. Have never made with sour cream and wouldn't again based on this (and have probably made at least 15 diff banana bread recipes!_

I didn't change a thing and I absolutely love this recipe. i've made it with apples, zuchinni and fresh pumpkin. if you use another fruit/vegie you need 2 cups of the item mashed to go into this recipe. i usually change something in a recipe and this one is perfect as is. i just like the variation of fruits since I pick them fresh and cook them down or blender them to fit this recipe. definately a 5 star!

Wow!!  This is a great recipe.  I added a tsp of baking powder whicI I think made the texture of the cake perfect and made the crumb topping as suggested by another reviewer.  I have made a lot of banana bread in my life and this is the best.  I have two standard loaf pans and it wasn't big enough to hold the batter so that was a problem.  I over filled the pans and some of the batter spilled out.  The crumb topping didn't look great as a result but hubby thought this was the best part.  Anyway will be making this again for sure.

this bread was awesome.  I forgot to put the bananas in and realized it when I was already adding the flour but I threw them in then.  Well it did not make a difference.  they came out delicious.  I shared with family and friends and they are asking when I will be making it again. I believe I baked them at 325, and a little bit longer.  Make sure you insert a toothpick in the middle to check if it is done inside, if it comes out clean, it should be done in the middle. this is my new banana bread recipe.

I make this quick bread often, and usually make one loaf and bake the rest as muffins.  I've got a few little personal changes but I stay pretty true to the recipe and everyone that has ever tried it says it's the best banana nut bread they've ever tasted.

We are going to a kid friendly party tonight and I was trying to find things I had laying around so I could bake a dish for the party. I had everything for this,but only two getting mushy bananas. So I halved the recipe (2 eggs) and added nutmeg and cloves and sprinkled the tops of each muffin with a bit of the cinnamon and sugar mix. I also baked them in mini muffin tins.They have come out so good. Looks like its going to make about 50 mini muffins. I baked them for about 20min at 300. Perfection!

This is a great Recipe! But like others I also baked at 325 oven. I also sprinkled cinnamon mixture on top. I made full recipe and put in two long bread pans. Turned out excellent! I will use this as my new standard. Oh, I did add a little nutmeg, and cloves with the cinnamon and only had five bananas so used those. Great!!! Everyone raves about this recipe!

This is a very forgiving recipe.  I used 5 bananas and had only one loaf pan so I used a bundt pan instead.  I glazed it with a cream cheese icing and it came out delicious!

This is pretty tasty. I had enough batter to make a few muffins (not enough for a whole loaf). I topped the muffins with the crumb topping mentioned by another reviewer and then filled them with a peanut butter creme. Even my kids liked those. 

I think I might use just one more banana next time. Mine might have been on the small side, so it could have stood at least one more. Overall great recipe.

Excellent!  I like it sweet (as written) but do add extra vanilla and cinnamon.  Bread is better day two or three after it's been baked, cooled and wrapped up - flavors definitely blend together better.  My cook time changes every time I make - probably the level of moisture and how much I hold true to the recipe;  it's very tolerant.  Extra chopped nuts on top give it a nice nutty touch.   Try toasting it until the outside is a bit crunchy and then put butter on it.  Just keep telling yourself that the potassium is good for you and not to worry about the butter! It's a bit crumbly but I always go for taste. This is my hubby's favorite banana bread; also like the Downeast Maine one from this site.

Excellent! 1 hour at 300 for 4 loaves just does not cut it. I used original recipe, added nutmeg to dry ingredient and to topping I made (1c brown sugar, 1c flour, 6 tbs melted butter, 2 tsp cinnamon & 1/2c chopped walnuts - sprinkled evenly over top of loaves) and bakes for 1hr 20 mins at 325. Came out amazing! People at my work and my wife said it was the best bread of any kind they have ever had. Topping also help keep the tops of bread from burning or getting too dark. Enjoy!

I've used the same banana banana bread recipe for years and was looking for a change and found this recipe.  It is wonderful!  The dusting of cin/sugar makes a huge difference, in a good way! Give this recipe a try, it is a wonderful tasting banana bread!
PS. I think 16 oz. of sour cream is way too much so I only use 8 oz. and it turns out great!

This is very good bread. I made two large loafs. Put foil over the top the 30 minutes or so to keep from over browning. The texture is not what I expected but it has been a long time since I made banana bread. I cooked it at 325 degrees for about 1 1/2 hours; a toothpick inserted in the middle came out clean. It tastes good with cream cheese.

This banana bread was fantastic! I love it just how it is and have made it several times! Tonight I will be making two loaves, adding chocolate chips to the remaining batter and making muffins for my girls. Thanks for sharing this!

This was a huge hit with my family!  The only change I made was to sub nonfat, plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream.  I also halved the recipe for a smaller bunch.  We gobbled it up in no time!  This is my new go-to banana bread recipe.

I've never made banana bread before and this was a fabulous recipe to use! Easy and very tasty. The sour cream really gives it a good flavor. I wouldn't substitute with fat free (not good in baking), but low-fat is a good option. I love cinnamon, so I tripled the amount. Added a teaspoon of ground clove, too. YUM!

Soooo disappointed.  I really wish I would've read the bad reviews first...lesson learned.

The bake time wasn't accurate at all!  After an hour, I still had four loaves of batter in my oven.  Had to crank the temp up slowly, first to 320 for 20 minutes, then to 350 for another 20.  

Result: My loaves didn't rise, and now I have these solid bricks that remind me of banana flavored play-dough.  

Such a waste of time, money, and the beautiful organic ingredients I splurged for.

 Why the heck do people like this recipe so much?  What am I missing?

EXCELLENT!  That was the BEST batter I have ever had!   So was the final product of course.  I would recommend refrigerating it.  Also, there is absolutely no way you can just use 4 pans for this recipe.  It makes a huge bowl of batter and needed at least 8 pans.  I don't usually even like banana bread but this recipe was AWESOME!

I have made this twice and I took the four big loaves to separate functions.  It is amazing what a difference the sour cream makes. I have to admit that I will not make my mother's traditional banana bread anymore, except for my brothers. Everyone else likes this better, and so do I. 

Jan. 2020 
Update: Still making this recipe and giving it out to everyone who asks. Today I only had 1/2 container of sour cream so I used greek yogurt for the other half. You would never know.  I like to put a line of pecan halves down the top. I always use 2 C white sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar.  I bake at 325 instead of 300. It still takes a whole hour and sometimes more, but I have always made two big loaves instead of the four smaller ones.

This recipe is a huge hit with my husband and his Army buddies! They love it as is, but I like to add a pinch of nutmeg and dust the top with more of the cinnamon sugar to get a nice crispness to the top.

Very delicious and moist bread. Too much sugar though. The second time I made it I used 1 cup of granulated sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar and that was plenty. It did not need any more than that. 3 cups of sugar makes it way too sweet. Other than that, though, this is a great recipe; probably the best one I've tried and I make a ton of banana bread.

I made this bread to have on hand for breakfast and snacks while I had family staying with me this summer. They loved it as did I. As a matter of fact, I wanted to hide it (but I didn't) so I could keep it all for myself!!!
This is without a doubt, the best Banana Bread I have ever eaten! 
This is the only recipe I will use for banana bread from this point forward.
It's that good!

so yummy! I don't have loaf pans so I used a 9 x 13 and baked it for about 35 minutes. I had to bump up the temp to 350 halfway through since I was in a hurry to get it done for breakfast but it still came out perfect. Great taste and perfect texture.

I have made this recipe exactly as it says 5 times now and everyone that eats it says it is the BEST they have ever had! I love love it. One thing i did add the last few batches is a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and I call it "Chocolate Chip Banana Bread" its AMAZING. Highly recommend it!

Didn't rise all that much for me - maybe try 325 next time.  Also may vary how it's put together as it wasn't blended well enough.  Great tasting though!

Great recipe!  I didn't have the required 16oz of sour cream on hand.  Used 8oz and substituted 8oz of cream cheese for the remainder.  Also used regular sized loaf pans vs the smaller version mentioned. Baked them @ 325 degrees for 1hr 45mins.  Came out perfect!!!  Recipe is a keeper.

I think I've found the perfect recipe for awesome banana bread!! The only thing I did was add a dash of pumpkin pie spice and added the crumbly topping (sugar, butter, cinnamon, flour) before baking.  I halved the recipe and baked it all in a 9x13 glass baking dish (because I don't have loaf pans) at 310 for 1hr 10 min and it came out moist and delicious!!

Excellent recipe.  Very moist.  I didn't have four loaf pans though and split it between what i did have.  Didn't know enough to not fill the pan - some ended up on the bottom of the oven (until i put a catch pan there).  I did eat the drippings!!

I just made this recipe for a second time, and I tweaked a few things which led to the BEST Banana Bread that I have ever made (seriously).  

I always use half whole wheat and half white flour when I make banana bread, but the real key to my success this time was not following the recipe (the batter was a little too loose the first time).  I just added a little flour at a time until the batter looked like the banana bread dough of my childhood.

Secondly, I froze all of my bananas completely and then I let them thaw.  It created ooey gooey perfect bananas for the dough.  No mashing required.

Turns out perfectly every time. I have seen a couple of reviews that state "underdone" and "doughy." I have to wonder about their ovens.

Very good! I made a third of his recipe and it made one 9x5 loaf. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream and everyone loved it.

Best banana bread I have ever made/ eaten. Everyone who tastes it agrees- it is so so moist and delicious. As others have said, the bake time does seem to be a bit off, but if you test the bread before taking it out, there should be no problems. I cut this in half and bake 1 loaf at 325 degrees for about an hour and 15 minutes

The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because it honestly tasted just like regular ol' banana bread. I was expecting a nice "zing" from the sour cream, but it just didn't shine through. I followed the recipe, making no adjustments, but it just didn't deliver. Sorry!

Bread was delicious! Used 1.5 bananas, and added strawberries to end up w 3 cups fruit. Only thing I'd change is to use a tad less baking soda. This will be a well used recipe at our home. Will try w/ apples next.

This was so moist!  I cut the original recipe in half (set the servings to 16) and it was perfect.  I ended up using 2 eggs and 1 stick of butter.  I also sifted all dry ingredients together (except sugar) before adding to wet ingredients.  We loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe!  This is a keeper!

By far the BEST banana bread recipe I've ever made.  I'm not a big fan of cinnamon so I omitted dusting the pan w/ cinnamon and adding cinnamon into the batter.  I instead dusted the pan with raw sugar before adding batter for an awesome crunch crust.  Mixed in about 1 cup each of bittersweet chocolate chips, semisweet chocolate chips and chopped walnuts to my batter.  I always get request for this delicious bread!!

I followed the recipe, my husband loved it! It was very moist. It became our quick power breakfast before going to work. He thinks the sweetness is perfect with a glass of milk. I plan to reduce the sugar to 2 cups next time.. he will never know! I posted a picture and am so proud of this!

Phenomenal!  I love that it is a large recipe.  If you're going to make something great, do a bunch of it so you don't run out too fast.  I made it more versatile by making 1 large loaf, 8 large muffin sizes, and 12 cupcake-sized (in muffin tins with paper cups and I added a little cinnamon/sugar to the bottom of each muffin cup).  Careful on the timing for the muffins, as the little ones were ready in just under 30 minutes and the bigger ones a bit later.  Per other recommendations, I cooked them at 325.  I pulled the muffins out when they were golden and left the loaf in for 55 minutes and then covered with foil and added another 15 (for 1 hour 10 minutes total) since other reviews said that it could be uncooked in the middle.   PERFECT!!!  If I had not covered with foil, it surely would have been overdone on top.
I filled a gallon freezer bag with half of this amazing bread and we pull a couple out at a time to defrost for a fresh snack.  
I LOVE banana bread, and will not ever make any other recipe!!!

The best banana bread I have ever made!  I didn't change anything.  It came out perfectly, not to moist not to dry.  I did have to cook the loaves longer then 1 hour.  It took 1.5 hrs.

This bread is an easy and tasty treat. I halved the recipe and used canola oil in place of butter. When baking I think it helps to use a higher temp but if you use common sense with your temp and time, and check it 3/4 of the way through it should be easy to end up with properly baked loafs. All in all, this may be one of my favorite banana bread recipes.

Delicious!!  I followed the advice of a couple reviewers:  halved the recipe and used 2T butter and 1/4c applesauce in place of the butter.  Also used 4 bananas and added a bit of nutmeg and ground ginger in addition to the cinnamon.  This bread is amazing, i just froze some down so i don't eat it all tonight.

This was an amazing banana bread. The only thing I did different was at the request of my 3yr old son was to add a little chocolate chips to it. My kids kept asking for more bread!

I made these for my hubby & my dad and we all LOVED them... we even had them for dessert! I halved the recipe and made muffins so sprinkled the sugar mixture on top instead of in the pan. For a more figure friendly version I used no sugar added applesauce instead of butter, agave nectar, egg beaters, fat free sour cream & half whole wheat, half unbleached flour. THE BEST banana bread ever!

This is a great recipe after adjusting, not the way it is written.  3c. of sugar is too much, I used 2c.  I added one more egg, in leu of the 1c. sugar.  I used 2 1/4c. all-purpose flour and 2 1/4c. whole wheat flour.  This recipes made 4 9x5 loaf pans when baked at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  Cover the loaves with tin foil for last 15 min. to avoid over browning.  Be sure to grease the pan.  Turns out very moist!

First time making.  So delicious!  This will be a recipe I will make often.  I used three 5 x 9 pans instead of the four specified in the recipe.  The bake time was just a bit longer.  Highly recommended!!

I have made this recipe countless times and shared it countless more times! Everybody loves this moist banana bread. I cut into slices after bread has cooled, and freeze individually by wrapping in saran wrap. Its a perfect way to have a quick on-the-go snack that defrosts in minutes.

This recipe truly is the best ever! I hate banana bread but this I like. Super soft and moist. I made loaves for the family and they ALL love it!. I added a little more banana and vanilla flavoring and floured the pans with brown sugar and cinnamon. Taste the difference. Smells like cinnamon tastes like banana.

This is the banana bread recipe I have been searching for! I love the banana bread from Starbucks, and can never get mine taste as good. This totally does it! It is sweet, rich and moist. The only changes I made were adding some cake spice from Penzey's and using two 5 x 9 in loaf pans instead of the smaller pans. I baked it at 300 for 1 1/2 hours and covered the loaves halfway through the baking time with foil so they wouldn't get too brown. Amazing stuff!!!

I was expecting something phenomenal, and it was just ok. It turned out just fine and was definitely moist. But I've had much better banana bread, so my hunt for the best one continues.

Yum, Yum, Yum.  Great recipe.  I think this is my favorite recipe I have tried.  I used whole wheat flour and added extra s. cream and it turned out great.  This will be one I use over and over.

Awesome recipe.  I make this, at least, once a month, sometimes more.  It's fantastic with sour cream, but I've had wonderful results substituting balkan style yogurt.  I love adding chocolate chips, but my husband doesn't, so I'll portion out two plain loaves then add chocolate chips to the last one.  I've also found that I like it better without the cinnamon, but that's just a personal preference.  It's still awesome with the cinnamon.

This was a fabulous recipe! I read many of the reviews and altered accordingly. I raised he temp to 325 and baked it for about an hour. I have a convection oven and this time and temp worked perfectly! I also added chocolate chips coated in flour to half of the batch. Great response from everyone who tried it!

I made this recipe for my family and my parents, and got RAVE reviews!  My dad said, "That's the best banana bread I have ever tasted!"  My dad is 68, and has tasted his share of various banana breads over the years.  :)  Awesome recipe!  I followed it--no variations (except perhaps 1/8 cup less sugar because the bananas I had were so brown that they were very sweet already, and I mashed the bananas too.

Terrific!  Has replaced my decades old recipe.  Love that it makes two loaves, because it disappears so fast!

I think this may be the best banana bread I have ever had.... even tops my moms!  Sorry mom!  I cut the recipe in half and it tasted just fine.  Will definitely turn to this recipe again and again.  (I used whole wheat flour and it was absolutely scrumptious.)

This is the best banana bread recipe I've tried (and I've tried a lot).  Changes I made: I halved the recipe; used one whole egg plus one egg white to equal 1 1/2 eggs; used 1 cup of sugar; baked for 1 hr 15 min.  PROS: 1.  The sour cream does give it a more dense texture but it also imparts more moisture.   2.  The flavor is light but complex with the cinnamon, sour cream and vanilla. 3.  It browns beautifully with a nice, crisp top.  I realize this is a personal preference. 4.  Not too sweet  but I did use one cup of sugar instead of the 1 1/2 that it asked for  CONS: 1.  I halved the recipe thinking I only wanted 2 loaves but after loading the first pan I realized that the two loaves would be very short, so I put all the batter into one 7X4 pan.  It rose impressively and looked appetizing! I don't think the recipe should suggest 4 loaves, but when made as written should be 2 loaves.  However, my one loaf did take 1 hr and 15 minutes to bake. 2.  The cinnamon sugar dusting made the edges overly sweet for me, but my 3 teenagers loved the 'chewy' sides.  I will try the recipe without the sugar dusting. 3.  I would NOT add the dry ingredients individually to the wet.  FIrst, mix the dry ingredients in a bowl and add in bulk to the wet, then MIX ONLY TO COMBINE.  There will be some specks of white flour but no clumps of white flour.  Do not mix til smooth;  DO NOT overmix or the bread will be tough.

A huge hit with my family. I even had a neighbor gal ask me for my banana bread recipe because her kids had come home saying my banana bread was the best! I have half the recipe to just make one loaf, and made the whole recipe which made two very large loafs.

Wow! Awesome banana bread. I used 11 medium bananas (I had quite a few ripe ones), but did not alter the recipe much. Used I can't believe it's not butter spread instead of butter, and just poured the cinnamon (and pumpkin pie spice) in until I felt like there was enough! I think it does better in mini tin loaf pans as opposed to the large loaf pans. Also cooked at 325 for an 1 hour 10 minutes and it was perfect.

DELICIOUS- a true crowd pleaser- fabulous-- moist- smooth yet complex in flavor -   -everyone loved it-the perfect "coffee cake"  made it for co-workers, family, and friends. Devoured in no time. Good for anytime of the year. Used the small package of walnuts- it was just enough.

Fantastic! I substituted fat free plain yogurt instead of sour cream; used 75% white flour 25% wheat flour; instead of dusting the pan with the sugar/cinnamon mixture, I added walnuts to it and added it as a struessel of sorts. I used the recipe to make the best banana nut muffins I've ever tasted!

Best banana bread ever. Whenever my bananas go bad, I throw them in the freezer only to take them out to make this recipe. I do not bake often, and everyone who tries this askes for my recipe. It is moist and delicious. I am very picky about what I put in my recipe box, and this is one of my TOP picks.

FANTASTIC! I doubled the recipe and brought them to a family reunion. We ate 4 of the loaves and the other 4 were used as an auction item we have during our reunion. They brought BIG bucks! Not your average banana bread! Not sickening sweet and not overpowering......really good recipe!

Meh. It was good, but I don't know what all the fuss was about. It wasn't exceptionally moist, in fact, it just tasted like plain old banana bread.

I love this recipe!  I made 3 adjustments and boy- -- moist and rich.  Instead of vanilla extract, I used banana exact, and added vanilla powder for the rich flavor.  I half the sour cream to 8oz and then add 8oz of vanilla yogurt.  I end up giving away allot of banana bread because it was so delicious.

This banana bread recipe IS better than others. I'm usually not a big fan of banana bread or muffins. I made this for my children. I have to say it was GREAT! The sour cream cuts that "sweet" taste that most banana breads have. This is not overly sweet. I halved the recipe, used two eggs, baked these at 325 for about 40-45 mins and followed the rest of the recipe (of course where the recipe says 3 cups of sugar you have to change that when you halve the recipe). I made muffins and a small bread with the left over batter. (I over filled the tins a little because someone else said theirs didn't rise much. Mine rose fine. Maybe I used a 'little' extra soda.) I did separate wet from dry ingredients and just folded them together as to not over-stir them. The result was some very moist, wonderful muffins and bread. These had great texture as well. I had no need for any kind of topping. I did cinnamon and sugar the tins and probably added a little extra cinnamon to my batter- I eyeballed it. Wonderful~ the sour cream just does it! Great recipe!

Delicious.  very moist and flavorful.  I subbed applesauce for most of the butter and a 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for regular and it was still wonderful.

I also cannot believe I'm am also one of the few who had trouble with this recipe. The directions called for baking 1 hour at 300 degrees. (Which I also questioned but followed.) My loaves were totally raw in the center! (even left them in for an additional 25 minutes. What a waste.

Fantastic bread! Love what the sour cream does to the bread. It is so moist, with a creamy taste. Delish. This will be my go to banana bread recipe from now on. I did not change a thing and followed the recipe exactly. It made two loafs for me, probably 3 for anyone else. One was a regular bread loaf pan and the other was a 9X9 square. I added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips after I poured the first loaf. Mixed and poured in the 9X9. I put tin foil on the last half of cooking so it wouldn't get to brown. Great twist. My 2 year old can't get enough!

I didn't read any of the reviews before making this recipe.  Big mistake on my part.  I baked as it said and my loaves were runny in the middle-totally raw.  I thought that the 300 degree oven seemed too low. I even returned them to the oven and tried to cook them longer, but it was like they were never going to get done.  I was afraid that the outsides and the bottom would burn. I was really dissappointed.  I will try to make it again, only because I think with all the changes that are suggested in some of the reviews that it will be really good.

My husband & kids said it was the best banana bread ever.  I did not have any 7x3 pans - but the batter fit perfectly into the 2 larger bread pans I did have.  I was also nervous about baking the bread at 300 because I had the larger pans & Ive never baked banana bread at that temp - so I baked the bread (with the oven rack on the lowest so the top of the bread pan was in the middle of the oven) at 350 degrees for an hour and 15 minutes and it turned out perfect.   I also substituted 2.5 cups of the flour with whole wheat (standard for me) and I have to say this recipe makes a very good whole wheat recipe.

I've made this recipe many many times and it never fails to amaze me. I made it again just yesterday and here are the modifications I made.  - Used 6oz greek yogurt and 10oz activia yogurt instead of sour cream as I had none at home - Used 5 long bananas - Measured out all the dry ingredients into one bowl so I wouldn't forget any of them, before proceeding to mix the sugar and butter - Used Smart Balance instead of butter - Used 1.5 cups natural cane sugar and 1 cup brown sugar so it wasn't too sweet - Spooned half the mixture into a mini loaf pan and a 9-inch loaf pan, and added 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup cranberries to the remaining half of the mixture before spooning into another mini loaf pan and a 9-inch loaf pan - Recipe yielded 2 9-inch loaves and 2 mini-loaves - Baked at 325F for 1hr 10mins  It was absolutely delicious! Thank you for the recipe.

absolutely fantastic! I did up the temp to 325, and omitted the nuts, but that was the only change.  This is my new recipe for banana bread!  Even the dough tasted amazing!

IT MAKES 4 LOAVES!!  Just had to say that since I didn't read that part in advance.  haha  I only have 2 loaf pans so now I cut the recipe in half (I tried buying four 7x3 but haven't found them yet) *** Anyway this is delicious!!  Super moist!!!  My nephew is extremely picky and the only thing he looks forward to eating at Christmas is this bread!!  **** Dust your pans with cinnamon sugar sparingly unless you like a lot of sweetness.  I also adjust the baking time due to my pan size and go with the tried and true toothpick test but it's usually 1 hour to 1 hr 15min depending.

I made a couple of minor changes:  I substituted 1/4 cup of the butter with virgin coconut oil (solid and white, like shortening); I added 2 TBS of banana liqueur, and 4 TBS of dark rum.  This made the mixture a little looser, so I added another 1/4 cup of flour.  I also decreased the sugar by 1/2 cup.  Baking time increased a little, so I kept checking every 10 minutes after 1 hour, and it took another 30 minutes.  The bread came out super moist and delicious!  I recommend this recipe to anyone, with or without my changes.  SO GOOD!

My loaves came out completely raw in the middle, and almost burnt around the edges. I tried cooking it longer, but it didn't work. The banana bread was way to sweet as well. I am going to play with this recipe, and hopefully when i try it again today it will work.

All I have to say is WOW!! This is the best Banana bread I have ever tasted. I would have to say an hour baking time isn't enough. I had mine in the oven for 90 mins... I also used fat free sour cream. It's delicious!

This recipe was delicious, although I did have some trouble with only 300 degrees on the first batch. I just bumped the oven up to 325 and kept it at 1 hr cook time and the rest of the loaves came out perfect!

Good, not great. The ratio of bananas and butter to flour and sugar is lean and I didn't think the results were outstanding.  I've another recipe that has more intense and moist banana and butter volume (and hence, flavors) with brown sugar lending caramel undertones.  BTW, for any banana bread recipe, try using your electric mixer to whip the bananas for a more even, moist texture (they really liquefy)

This is THE BEST banana nut bread I've ever made! I followed the recipe except reduced the sugar to one cup. My bananas were super ripe, so that probably made up a little of the sweetness. The cinnamon sugar is a great touch. Thank you for sharing!

This is a nice moist bread but I think it lacks the banana flavor.  I cut the recipe in half because I didnt need to make 4 loaves.  Instead I made 1 loaf of bread & 6 muffins (bake for just 30 min).  It's good, but not for us.  I have a fave banana recipe that uses 3 bananas for just one loaf.

Delicious and Sooo moist, but not to moist. i used a topping from a different recipe and it was perfect, here is the recipe:  1/2 cup cold butter, cut into small pieces 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup packed brown sugar 2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 1 cup quick cooking oats 1 cup chopped pecans   Mix all ingredients in a bowl until it crumbles. set aside until bread is ready to bake.  sprinkle the top of each loaf with one forth of the topping.  Use the pecans (or walnuts) instead of the walnuts in the banana bread recipe

YUMMYYY.....I made 2-10X5 loafs, one I added chocolate chips to it and the other I increased the cinnamon and added nutmeg, allspice and cloves.  I also made extra cinnamon, brown sugar and white sugar and used it as a topping for both loafs.

OMG this was so awesome.  Stuck to the recipe for the most part and I'm glad I did.  Unbelievably Good.  The only thing I did different was that I used 5x9 pans so I only made 2 loaves and had to bake them another 20 minutes or so on top of the hour.  Great Recipe and EASY!!!!!!

Wonderful! For those who would like one regular loaf, read on: Change servings to 10. There are some weird amounts, but we're big kids, we can handle it. Bake at 325 for an hour OR a little longer so the inside is done. I covered it with foil about 40 min into baking. It turned out delicious! Great recipe.

Excellent! The bread is very moist and the cinnamon sugar crust is tasty. I didn't have an appropriate pan so I used a large cast iron pan. Not sure if that was why or if the recipe time was inaccurate to begin with,  but I did end up cooking the bread for almost two hours, as well as increasing the temperature to 325 for the second half.

Halved recipe using 4 small bananas and 2 eggs, only have larger size bread pan so ended up with two relatively small loaves that I cooked only 45 minutes on 325.  Not sure why it's "airier" than other recipes for me, I like them dense and I don't feel these are as dense as i like them.  They certainly taste good, however.  I followed one reviewer's instructions and folded in the flour mixture.  I did beat the other ingredients together quite well, perhaps too much?

Absolutely delicious! I made it just as instructed but with "light" sour cream since that's all I had on hand--it was just great! I might try some of the other "lighten up" methods listed here but this is a dessert cake really, and is super!

Added chocolate chips & skipped the nuts when I made it in Indiana. Christy doesn't like nuts.  The whole family likes chocolate chips. I will follow the recipe for other people.

Delicious!  This tasted close to my mom's recipe, which is hard to top!  I too cut the recipe in half but instead of doing 2 cakes, I made in a 10x10 pan.  I cooked on 325 for 1 hour and it was perfect- golden brown and perfectly moist!

Sour cream is a MUST for banana bread. Once you try it, you'll never make it without it. I love all the suggestings for strudel and cinnamon toppings. I would suggest, for those having trouble the bread not cooking fast enough to bump the temperature to 350 for 50-60 minutes. You can use foil if top starts to brown too much. Most other recipes I have used call for 350 degrees. Yum!

I cannot bake! I make banana bread once a year cause I didn't get to eat my bananas.  It always turns out horrible!  THIS is the first thing I have baked ever that turned out good.  It is amazing!I halved the recipe but used the same amount of bananas and added nutmeg.  It was so GOOD! Thank you for making me think I can bake again.

This is FABULOUS!  I have made it several times and it is now my go-to banana bread recipe.  My boyfriend couldn't tell that I substituted whole wheat (all purpose) flour and splenda in!  A definite winner for us!

Excellent moist banana bread.  I was out of sour cream so I ended up using plain yogurt.  I also added a little nutmeg and clove.  I used two regular sized loaf pans, baked at 325 for 1 hour 10 minutes and it turned out great!

Can I give this more than five stars. It is excellent and so easy. I seperated the batter and made nut and a no-nut loaf----YUMMY  If you have orange or lemon zest-add it!!

Great banana bread recipe! Beautifully dense and moist. It did not cause heartburn, which I always have dealt with afterward. I recommend this recipe highly...especially with black walnuts! mmm mmm good!

Made this the other day exactly as directed, except added mini chocolate chips instead of nuts. It is absolutely scrumptious, I wouldn't change anything about this recipe. We ate one loaf and froze the rest for Christmas Day.

This bread really is moist and delicious!  We tweak it by adding blueberries (we use frozen) and it comes out even more moist and flavorful.  We make it every Christmas and our family friends rave about it.  Thank you!

This is a wonderful banana bread! I made 8 mini-loaves in 325 degree oven for 45 minutes. They turned out beautiful with the cinnamon crumbs that I made: 1/3 C brown sugar, 3 Tbs all-purpose flour; 1 tsp ground cinnamon; 1/2 C walnuts; and 1 1/2 Tbs butter. I will definitely make this again!

This was really good but mine fell in the middle after an hour even though a toothpick came out clean. After fully cooling I see it fell because it looks not done... this was my fault and next time I will cook it longer. I cut the recipe in half because I didn't need 4 loaves and I didn't have enough bananas for it. I also didn't have the small bread pans (7x4) mine are all 8.5x4 (standard size). I always have left over sour cream so this was a great way to use it up plus my husband loves banana bread. As usual I added extra walnuts - 1 cup is never enough for him! Thanks for the recipe!

The sour cream in this recipe really makes it the most delicious and moist bread!  I brought it to the inlaws and it was gone in a matter of minutes.  Definitely a hit.

Excellent. I've been testing numerous BB recipes and this is the winner. Who knew that a basic sour cream coffee cake recipe could be adapted for BB.  I baked it in muffin tins and large loaves pans and both turned out perfectly.

I loved this recipe, although I too cut the recipe in 1/2, and baked at 325 for 60 minutes. My kids and husband love this and I have made it numerous times over the last few weeks.

I've made many loaves of banana bread in my day, and have tried many different recipes...this is the best by far. It has a really great texture and taste. I make a few loaves at a time and freeze some to  to keep  on hand for company, but my kids beat me to it every time. They  can barely wait for it to thaw before eating it.

Awesome recipe!  This is the first time I've ever made banana bread because I always make pumpkin bread.  Well, my signature pumpkin bread may be playing second fiddle to this recipe ...  After reading the reviews I, too, cut the sugar down to 2 1/2 cups.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

This recipe is amazing!!  I had some left over chocolate chips so I threw them in, YUM!! Unfortunately I didn't have a loaf pan so I ended up baking the batter in two round cake pans and one small square cake pan and it still turned out fabulous!!

Really, really moist and light.  I cut the recipe down to about 1/3 (1 egg, 2 bananas) to make just one regular sized loaf.  I also used light sour cream.  Adapted baking temp to 325 degrees for one hour, and it was perfect. The cinnamon sugar coating in the pan is a really nice touch, too.  A keeper for sho!!

This bread really WOW all of us! I halved the recipe to make 2 loaves and generally followed directions as stated, except reduced sugar to ¾ cup, used spatula to mix in flour instead of using an electric mixer to produce a more "bready" texture as per someone's suggestion and increased oven temperature to bake 325 degrees. My bread turned out to be super-moist and delicious; all thanks to the sour cream called for in the recipe. All of us really enjoyed this wonder breakfast bread and we especially love the crunchy crust!

This is now our go to banana bread recipe. We've made all size loaves 9x5 down to mini, including muffins with this recipe. I even have neighbors that drop off bananas to get some of this bread. They prefer theirs with chocolate chips added.

Fantastic AGAIN :D - This was my second time making this recipe - I used a different sized pan but the 300 cooking time for 1 hr worked perfectly for me ( my pans were larger than the 7X3 in the recipe ...mine are...9X5?). Both times I used more cinnamon and a little nutmeg or allspice and cut out a little sugar also- i never have sour cream on hand so I used lo-fat yogurt instead(and reduced serving size to 16 because I only had 3 bananas). Turned out FANTASTIC!

I have been searching for just the right banana bread.  This recipe is it!  I followed the recipe exactly.  My sour cream was light, and that didn't matter in the least.  So moist and delicious.  The cinnamon/sugar mixture on the sides and top really make a very nice touch.  Yum Yum.

Best banana bread ever!  Very moist with great flavor.  Make sure you use a really big batter bowl!  Mine nearly over-flowed once all ingredients were added.

Perfect!  I halved the recipe, which fit into one large loaf and 4 large muffins.  Also used the topping recipe that others suggested, which was awesome.  Sooo good!

I felt so professional cooking this recipe!  I'm a beginning cook and I wanted to try something that sounded fun and the sour cream taste was just what I was looking for.  Everyone that tried it here in Chile loved it because they had never eaten banana bread before.  So much fun!

Delicious! I halved the recipe, as I knew my husband and I could never eat that much bread. The bread was moist and yummy! My husband said he loved the cinnamon and sugar on the outside, which I am surprised he even noticed! It definitely gives it a special touch. Thank you Esther!!

Like others, I used applesauce instead of butter and used a little less than a cup of sugar, but I used 4 bananas instead of 3 to make up for the sweetness (for a half recipe).  This was really, really good!  The texture is amazing, it basically melts in your mouth.  I will definitely make this again and I don't even really like banana bread!  Also, I made mini muffins with part of the recipe and they were great, I baked them for about 15 minutes.

Made 6 servings to make a small 8 X 3 loaf pan. Replaced half the oil and sugar in batter with applesauce. Tasted great! Cooked for about 70 minutes.

Unbelievably delicious recipe! Thanks to the suggestions on temp and baking time for HALF the recipe, my first time making it turned out perfectly.   I added almost a full pint of blueberries (at the peak of ripeness, from the farmer's market) and everyone loved it, even my kid who does not like to try new things. DO NOT SKIP the butter/cinnamon-sugar in the pan, and do top it with whatever you have left of the mixture. A little crunch on the top is really nice, too, and makes this feel almost dessert-like.

Really good.  I used yogourt instead of sour cream because that's all I had and it turned out really good.  I baked it at 325.  The top was a little dark so I put foil on it near the end. I will make this again.

This is sooooo good! I used a bundt cake pan (filled halfway) and a 9x5 loaf pan. I also added a pinch of cloves and nutmeg to the batter. I have always had bad luck with banana bread so I am so excited to have an awesome recipe! Next time I will make another bundt cake loaf and drizzle some chocolate over it. I did increase the temp to 325..but halfway through turned it back down and covered with foil.

It's my favorite!  I too made some changes for a healthier result:  only 2 cups sugar; I sub'd 1/2 c. butter buds and 1/4 c. applesauce for the 3/4 c. butter and use 2 c. white and 2 c. wheat flour with 1/4 c. ground flax seed for the 4.5 cups of flour.  USE THREE LOAF PANS - you will be glad that you did  :o)

Soft, moist and yummy!  This is by far the best banana bread I've ever had.  I cut the recipe in half but still had to bake it for 1 hour and 10 minutes at 325 degrees; however, the results were incredible.  Delicious!

I had 6 overripe bananas in the refrigerator yelling at me to do something with them and when I stumbled across this recipe I was finally able to silence them. The flavor is this bread was amazing! It was fluffy, had a crusty top, the perfect amount of cinnamon and vanilla, and almost creamy with the sour cream...almost. My only complaint was that it was a bit too sweet. So now I usually omit the 1/4 cup of sugar and just take that much away from the 3 cups of sugar and use that along with the additional cinnamon to dust the pans. Very good recipe; one of the best banana breads I’ve ever had! I'd give this 4 and 1/2 stars if I could, but I'll be nice and give 5 instead.

Got rave reviews from my husband about this bread!  He said his favorite part was the sugary crust, so don't skip that part!  I halved the recipe (used 2 eggs and 2 1/2 bananas) and the only  additions I made were 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of cloves.  Delicious!

this is a great recipe! i have made this 2 times now and have not had one complaint. i did alter it alittle though. first of all, i have cut the recipe in half. also i cut the cinnamon into 1/4 of what the recipe calls for and then i add alittle less than 1/8 of ground cloves and alittle less than 1/8 nutmeg. this really makes the bread just how my grandmother's bread was.

I followed directions exactly even thought I thought the oven temp was going to be too low. Next time I would do it at 325.  Cooked breads the exact time and was raw in middle- cakes sunk in middle. We ate around the cooked outside part and was tasty.  I added chocolate chips to a few of the cakes and was delicious. I am just sorry that I am going to have to through out half of them because the middles are undercooked. My oven is brand new so I don't think its an oven thing.  Plus, this recipes make a huge amount.  I didnt try to cut it down because I didnt want to mess things up, however now I wasted a ton of ingredients on a cake that didnt work. I will stick to my better homes and gardens cookbook recipe for banana bread.

I really liked the sour cream twist on the bread, the moistness is great. It still stays a bread and not a cake like some do. I made muffins, and did a cinnamon/sugar topping, the kids love them!

Snaps for Esther! We really enjoyed this bread. I halved the recipe and it was perfect. I added fresh ground nutmeg, a bit more cinnamon and allspice. My daughter said it smelled like Fall in the kitchen. I made one plain and one with chocolate chips.I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup white. I baked them at 400 degrees for 7 min. and 330 degrees for 50 min. They werent gummy or raw just perfect. Thanks, its a keeper!!!

I followed reviewers's suggestions, including turning up the heat and cooking for a longer time - I ended up with something like bread pudding with a rubbery shell.  However, because of all of the good reviews I will may try this recipe again. It seems like the happiest reviewers made only half a recipe.  Probably next time I would make only half the recipe as the whole recipe is an awful lot to deal with if one is not satisfied.

This is the perfect banana bread. It actually cooks in the middle - no gooey stripe down the center.  My daughter received a blue ribbon at the county fair with this recipe.

This recipe is excellent! I used nonfat greek yogurt instead of sour cream and substituted 1/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce for 1/4 cup of the butter and the bread was delicious (and pretty healthy)!

I halved the recipe and then made it "as is" and it came out perfect.  I cooked them in a Pampered Chef mini loaf pan that has (4) 5X2 loaves and it was the ideal size for the halved recipe.  Everyone loved it, including the kids.  Thanks.

This is hands down the best banana bread recipe I've tried. I followed the directions exactly and ended up with 3 incredibly tasty loaves. The only thing I would suggest is putting some aluminum foil on the top at about 45 minutes to prevent over-browning. I'm recommending this to people.

This was really good banana bread!  My kids loved it.  I did reduce the sugar to 1 cup on a 16 serving recipe and it was plenty sweet - and I have a sweet-tooth.  The crust was delicious with the cinnamon and sugar.  I did make it in a stone pan which makes the crust a little yummier.  Thank you for the recipe!

WOW! My husband was sent home with a banana nut loaf earlier this month by a relative. We ate it but both agreed that this was NOT the best we'd had. So since I ALWAYS have bananas that sit and sit until they land in the garbage, I decided to try a loaf myself. Well THANK YOU! this made a wonderful snack. First of all, I am high altitude and I made no changes for that with no problems at all. I made 1 5X9 loaf, baking at 325 for 1hr 15min,  I used fat free sour cream, and Also I used 3 and 1/2 bananas( a little more than a 5X9 called for).  Otherwise I followed this recipe to the T and it turned out great.

This was a fantastic recipe. I followed the directions to the "T" and all four turned out wonderful. I brought a loaf to my good friends house to share and they both LOVED it. Asked for the recipe right away. The only thing that I would do to put a lil pop in there is add chocolate chips! This is something my mother did growing up, love it! FYI fluff chocolate chips in the flour before you add it to the rest of the mixture..this prevents then from sinking to the bottom of the pan:) happy baking:)

AWESOME! I only make for holidays because it is like eating cake. I followed ther recipe exactly and then did a topping of 1 cp. brown sugar, 6 tbsp. softened butter, 2/3 cp. walnuts, 1 cp. flour and 2 tsp. sugar. I had to bake mine for 1 hour and 45 minutes at 300. I usually wrap 2 loaves in foil and then put in freezer bags and freeze for special occasions. It tastes just as good after freezing and this recipe makes such a large amount, it's nice to have leftovers.

Wow! This is the most perfect banana bread ever!   This is my first time making it so I used the full amount of sugar and did not substitute with apple sauce so that I have a basis.  I did make the crumbly topping which I use for the zucchini bead.   I cooked at 325 for 1 hr 10 minutes.  I added a dash of nutmeg.  I did not need a blender at any point as others have mentioned they did. I just made sure the butter was soft and used a spatula to "cream" together with the sugar.  Fabulous! Will make again and again!

OMG!  This is the BEST banana bread I've ever tasted.  We entered it into our county fair this past weekend and it received GRAND Champion honors and sold for $800!!!!  I did follow the advice of another by adding the topping to the top.  It gave it that added punch and I think it made a difference to the judges too!  I had to use 7x9 loaf pans, so I kept the recipe quantity the same and divided it amongst 3 pans. I use Pampered Chef Cinnamon plus in all my recipes, so that's what I used here as well.  YUM YUM YUM!!!

I love this recipe!!! My husband says it's the best banana bread he's ever had!!! I made just a few changes, although I am sure it would have been perfect the other way as well! I used 8 oz. fat free sour cream and 8 oz. light sour cream. I also used 1 cup  white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, and 1 cup Splenda. I added a dash of nutmeg as suggested by another reviewer. I split between 3 pans- since that is what I had. Baked at 320 degrees, and checked after 45 min. One of them was already done, so keep an eye on it!! I also covered with tin foil, as another reviewer suggested, towards the end of the time, so it was not to dark. I love this bread! It is wonderful!! Thank you!!!

WOW-I WOULD GIVE THIS MORE THEN 5 STARS! LITE AND DELICIOUS. I will make this again. I didnt have the size pan it suggested i used 6" rounds and they did spill over. Glad I put them on a sheet pan. The pill over was good also, cruchy. You will love this bread, but it is cake like in texture. Very moist. YUM!

Good recipe, but I think I'll go back to my old recipe.  Mainly because this recipe called for four pans and made so much batter than I had to throw a third of it out, because I didn't have enough pans for it all.

According to one of the helpful reviews, I halved recipe and made two 7 1/2" x 9" loaves and baked at 325 degrees for 1 hr 10 mins. I agree that you can't really make the butter and sugar in the beginning "cream." I think this has something to do with the problem of this recipe. I even hand-mixed the flour in to create a denser, bread-like consistency. I didn't achieve anything close to "bread." Like some other reviewers, the consistency I got was more of a cake. After letting them cool, I could barely get them out of the pan and ended up with something like crumbly cake. Barring all that, I still gave it 2 stars because for all its problems, somehow it still tasted pretty good - for cake.

I made this for Christmas morning and it's the best banana bread I've ever had.  Nice and moist!  I followed recipe but baked in 3 normal sized loaf pans at 325 for about 1 hour 10 minutes and they came out perfectly.  Will definitely use this one again when the bananas pile up!

if there was a 10-star rating here, i'd select that. this was so  good that i made it to give away to family and friends for Christmas. I love to cook but baking is my Waterloo. But follow this recipe to a T and it is fool-proof. Actually, even if the bananas are not super ripe, still came out fantastic! Starbucks has their version of this called Banana Walnut Loaf...uggh, nothing compared to this---at all. Thanks for recipe! It's almost unfair for me to take the credit when i hear the ooohs and aaahs. Oh, i know it sounds weird, but i love mixing sweet and salty, so i always pair this with Doritos chips Verde Salsa flavor...just for me :-) --- to DLPALMA: not sure why yours did not turn out right. I've made this twice already, the 2nd time, i did 2 batches, baked them all together, added like 15 mins for each batch and it came out perfect. Could it be the settings of your oven? Or if you used electric or gas oven. I have gas which i think is even more tricky. Also, hopefully you did not use a bigger loaf pan that what was required. I'm thinking the density of the loaf is also important. Baking is precise which is why i'm not too fond of it because i'm an eye-baller. So this one, i followed exactly. It was fantastic!

Excellent recipe! For those of you who don't already know this trick, for mushy bananas throw them in the freezer - then when you're ready to make your banana bread, thaw, peel and you are good to go!

i had to cook this several times to get it right... the correct temp and time for me was 350 for 60-65 mins. instead of the cinnamon/sugar i put a warm simple sugar glaze.

I make banana bread frequently, and this is my favorite recipe.  The sour cream makes this bread perfectly moist.  I have also substituted yogurt or milk+1TBSP vinegar, depending on what I have on hand.  The last time I made it I also threw in some cinnamon chips (found by chocolate chips at the store) and it was amazing!

Good, I made one loaf (1/4 of the recipe) and had to bake it for about an hour at 315.  I used light sour cream and it did turn out a little crumbly but not to bad.

I made this recipe the other day and it was SO GOOD! I added a couple shakes of nutmeg, 1/4 tsp of ground cloves, about a tsp. of lemon juice and 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon. I didn't melt the butter because I have never heard of baking banana bread without creaming the butter and sugar. I also did not leave my bananas sliced, I mashed them because banana chunks just don't do well when baked in a bread. This is now my favorite banana bread recipe, I can't wait for my bananas to get nice and ripe so I can make more!

I make this again and again and again. The only change is that I add a couple handfuls of fresh or frozen blueberries (whatever is available).  This increases the cooking time about 10-20 minutes, depending on the oven (I travel alot), but it's worth it.  To me, blueberries are essential for this recipe.  People ask for this bread, my girlfriends and I usually keep some on hand for coffee talk.  

Don't miss out on this bread. Really.

I use a blender to chop the walnuts - much easier :)

(And I also have to bake for more than an hour at 325F, as another reviewer does).

I have used this recipe for a couple years now and have not tasted one better!  My family love it, and everywhere i take it, Im asked for the recipe.  I did increase the temp to 325 degrees and left it in for an hour, for larger loaf pan i left in for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  This recipe is super moist and is one of those that gets better everyday!  Thanks

Yes...this is very good!!  I made no changes except only made one loaf (changed servings to 8).  Found that 1 hr 10 min at 325 F was perfect.  This will be my new 'one and only' banana bread recipe.

Not too long ago, my boyfriend mentioned something about liking Banana Nut Bread.  Seeing as food is the key to someone’s heart, I decided to go one an extensive search.  I barreled though baking books, performed scientific experiments, graphed my findings from taste tests with chimpanzees, and even hunted down relatives of the late Betty Crocker.  – Well, close.. I Googled “Banana Nut Bread“ and came across this very recipe.  Shh.  No one has to know. :o)

My friend and her husband were having a large group of people over helping her move and unpack into their new home, so I decided that this was my chance to get my bake on and test my skills.

I made a few changes.  1) I added a dash or two of both ginger and nutmeg. 2) I used 7 bananas because the first three weren’t from the same bunch and appeared a little smaller. 3) I used the crumb topping suggested by other reviewer. 4) I used both walnuts and pecans. 5) I first toasted the nuts on a baking sheet in the oven at 350 degrees for ten minutes, and then chopped them after they cooled. 6) I used more nuts than the recipe called for. 7) Since the recipe didn’t specify salted or unsalted butter, I went ahead and used salted, but only used ¼ teaspoon when adding my dry ingredients. 8) I used a standing mixer for this recipe, which resulted in a more cake-like consistency, which isn’t a bad thing. 9) I used two 11¾ x 5½ x 3¼ Hefty EZ Foil Loaf Pans, sprayed them with butter-flavored Pam and coated with the cinnamon-sugar mixtu

I opted to make the whole recipe and *wow* is that a lot of banana bread! It came out beautifully and stayed moist until it was eaten up. The only note is that it did have to stay in the oven a bit longer than called for. Great recipe!

OMG, this is the one to try. I have tried several banana bread recipes, but this one is the only one I will make from now on. It turned out perfect. I did use what others suggested by cooking an additional 20 minutes (used the toothpick method) I also used foil around edges the last 30 minutes to prevent burning.

This bread is really soft and flavorful. Because some people noted the failure to rise, I made the entire batch but poured the batter into 3 pans intead of 4. The loaves came out great! I don't think I'll dust the pans with cinnamon and sugar next time because I don't think it added anything special. I also put in 1 cup packed brown sugar and 2 cups white (instead of 3 cups white). Other than that, no changes and absolutely delicious!

This was a wonderful banana bread. I halved it and it still took way over an hour to bake, and I didn't do the sugar crust. It was totally eaten by two of us in about 4 days.

Wow, my loaves turned out awesome! Followed the recipe almost to the tee.  From the suggestions of others, I upped the temp to 325 and cooked for 55 min, checking every 5 minutes after for doneness.  I think it was about 1hr 10min when I finally took them out.  So good!  I also halved the recipe as well.

Absolutely phenomenal! My changes; 7 bananas instead of 6, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg pwdr, extra 1/2 tsp of cinnammon. I cut down walnuts to 3/4 and added 3/4 cup of chocolate chips. I also reduced sugar a little to account for the chocolate. This was definitely rich and cake-like and got rave reviews from everyone at work. Do not skip the sugar crusting...it is fabulous!

This is a great delicious, reliable recipe. I made it for a group of Croatians (usually very picky and not apt to try anything new)and they loved it. I made a double batch and brought home an empty platter.

as promised, the bread was soft and moist. I ran out of all-purpose flour so I had to substitute it with cake flour (2 cups all-purpose, 2.5 cups cake). I also added some chocolate chips to the batter, but felt that it DOESN'T go well with the cinnamon, will definitely make again! but with walnuts/ pecans next time!!! thanks for the great recipe
PS: the amount of sugar may seem a lot, but it will turn out just fine and it WON'T make the bread too sweet, just follow the recipe!!! =)

I love this recipe!  My husband did too.  I added nutmeg (b/c I love nutmeg) and only did one loaf.  But I was so sad when the loaf was gone the same night I made it.  Everyone loves this when I make it.  This is my new Banana Bread recipe.

Used SaraLady19's suggestion of crumbly topping and they turned out wonderful! :-) Hubby gave 2 thumbs up!...........Update 12/12/10..........Halved the recipe. Used 2 tablespoons butter & 1/4 cup applesauce vs. all butter. Used 1 & 1/4 cups white flour & 1 cup whole wheat flour vs. all white. Used 1 cup white sugar & 12 truvia packets vs. all white sugar. Came out wonderful! Next time I will increase the truvia & whole wheat flour and decrease the white sugar & white flour.

My favorite banana bread recipe.  I use low fat sour cream and mostly King Arthur's White Whole Wheat flour (I mix a little regular white flour in too).  It has also come out moist and flavorful.  Never had any complaints :-)

I had a hard enough time not eating the raw batter before I baked it let alone not eating the entire loaf when it was finished! It was so soft and tender yet dense and hearty, and the almost crispy-crunchy texture on the outside from the cinnamon sugar was such a subtle yet essential part of it's deliciousness. I followed the recipe exact because I'm not much of a baker and I didn't dare mess it up but I did double the walnuts and used big walnut pieces because I just love the nutty, almost chewy flavor they provide. I also halved this recipe and did one bundt pan instead of two loaf pans, it turned out absolutely perfect.

The best banana bread I ever made.  Everyone who tastes it agrees. It is very moist and I love dusting the pan with cinnamon and sugar.  I will use that trick with other sweet breads.  The only change I made was using 1 1/2 c. whole wheat flour, 1 1/2 c. of oat flour (ground oat in a blender), and 1 1/2 c. of white flour.  I do this with most cookies and sweet breads I bake and it adds a deeper flavor.

This is a great recipe for banana bread.Very easy!! I adjusted in two ways. First I halved the sugar into half white cane sugar and the other half into brown sugar. Then I added nutmeg along with the cinnamon. I wished I would of had nuts or raisins to add. Adding the sugar cinnamon to the bottom is a great idea so I added some more to the top before baking. I used 3 loaf pans and they baked in 1 hour 10 minutes. Taste great!!

This was good bread! But the recipe says it makes 4 small loaves, it actually makes 8 small loaves - the 7 by 3 inch ones! I reduces it by half to make 4 small loaves and it was very good.

I followed the recipe exactly except for adding an extra banana yet I ended up with a dry almost flavourless loaf. I am wondering why. How important is it that the bananas are overripe? Mine had spots but I wouldn’t call them black, is that why it tastes so bland? I think youd need way more butter or spices to make this taste as good as some other recipes Ive tried. I don’t know why everyone else loved it when I find it disappointing

This bread is absolutely DELICIOUS!  I couldn't stop eating it!  I halved it with 2 eggs and 4 bananas.  I also used the crumb topping one member suggested.  The cinnamon sugar mixture in the pans is a genius idea because it gives the bread an extra sweet coating.  I love it and will make it again and again!!!

Yum!!!  I cut the recipe in half to make one big loaf in my Pampered Chef Loaf stoneware.  At 300 degrees, it took 1 hour and 30 minutes to bake and turned out perfectly.  I added the crumb topping and a dash of nutmeg and cloves as a previous reviewer suggested.  Will definitely make this banana bread again!

Yum, yum, yum!  Made the following modifications: made one 9 x 5 loaf by setting servings to 11, subbed plain low fat yogurt in place of sour cream, increased vanilla to 1T, added a big handful of chocolate chips and sprinkled walnut pieces on top, which allowed to them to get toasted.  Baked for 1hr 15 min at 300.

This was a very moist bread--and a great way for me to use up some of my sour cream that I keep buying because I have no short-term memory! I scaled it down because I only had 4 bananas. Great with my morning coffee on the way to work!

Like many other reviewers, I was convinced my mom's banana bread recipe was the best.  But, I had to try this one because of the sour cream--and, this one wins hands down.  The cinnamon-sugar crust is such a great idea, and the texture is perfect.  For those wondering how to make this with normal loaf pans (mine are 8 x 4), the full recipe fits in 2 of these, but I put some cookie sheets underneath because I was afraid the dough would spill over.  It got close, but never ran over.  The loaves were very pretty.

This bread is awesome!!  I will make this again and again! 
I always use mostly whole wheat flour as I did this time.  I would cut the sugar next time, though, but that's just me - don't like it too sweet.

I also followed some recommendations from SaraLady19.  For instance, I halved the recipe.  Baked the 2 loaves at 325 for 1 hr. 10 mins.  Made her crumb topping for one of the loaves. (I halved: 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 2 TBS butter, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and chopped walnuts).

I made this at Christmas this past year and my dad went nuts.  He said it was one of the best tasting banana breads he had ever had.  Be careful though, this recipe made a TON of bread (i believe I had 4 different loaves or so maybe even 6), so change the servings to what you need.  It's a great breakfast food as well!  enjoy!

It wasn't too banana-y... I'm not sure if it was because of the sour cream (I used really ripe bananas).  I will try this again but this time with more bananas.

Delicious. Made one loaf exactly as indicated with the exception of the cinnamon/sugar 'dusting'. Instead, I made a crumb topping using brown sugar, flour, butter, and cinnamon. It turned out moist with the perfect balance of sweet and banana flavor.

Not sure what happens with this one; it never got done though I let it almost 2 hours in the owen. I think it was the sour cream, as I use 50 cl for only 2 saucepans. If not, I really dont know. 
It was the second time I tried, first one with the same problem, and it was too sweet for my taste. 
I'll not try again. Sorry!

Very good recipe, very moist-could use a little more flavor, but I will definitely make again.  I did substitute 1/2 of the flour with whole wheat flour, and it turned out really well.  Also, we made 2 loaves and 12 muffins (cook for 25 minutes at 300 degrees).

With all the great reviews - I tried this with some changes to make it wheat & sugar free...I used spelt flour instead of the reg.flour, honey (2/3 the amount) instead of the sugar and plain yoghurt instead of the sour cream...it turned out fantastic & I can't wait to try it as written!  Thanks for such a flexible recipe!!

Fantastic bread! I halved the recipe (using 2 eggs and 4 bananas) and got two 9x5 loaves out of it (baked for just over an hour at 325 degrees) One of the best banana breads I've ever had!

Really good taste and very moist. Almost too moist. I used four 7 x 3" pans and baked them for an hour, it still wasnt enough time. They were still wet in the middle so put them back in the oven for 10 more mins. Came out great tasting but the cooking time is off.

I baked this one up twice so far for gift giving.  It makes a very delicate moist cake-like bread.  My daughter gave some to her 4th grade teacher, who stopped me to say it was so good. My daughter has requested it again, this time only for the family to eat. :)

Great recipe! I cut the sugar to 2 cups because of using large, very ripe bananas. I also used the mini pans (approx. 6 x 3.5) and baked them for 65 minutes. I was able to make 9 mini loaves, (& baked them all at once!) putting 1 cup of batter in each. After easily removing them from the pans, I placed them on their sides on a wire rack to cool. They'll make great gifts!

I used 2% plain yogourt instead of sour cream, since I made it for myself to have as an everyday snack.  I halved the recipe and only used 1 cup of sugar.  I don't like an extra-sweet bread.  I made two small loaves.  I did not add cinnamon, but only nutmeg and extra vanilla, which I believe gives it a much smoother taste.

This was really good; the texture was right on. I was worried about the sour cream, but the flavor wasn't overpowering, it balanced the bananas well. I skipped the nuts and it turned out great.

This one replaces mom's recipe. Sorry Mom! I didn't add nuts and I replaced the cinnamon with pumpkin pie spice. Also..I used 10 or 11 very ripe bananas ( I bought a bag of them at the grocery store for 50 cents!)and reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup to counter the sweetness of the bananas. Other reviewers are not kidding! This makes A LOT of batter. I ended up mixing it in a giant stock pot because it was overflowing my mixer bowl before I added the flour and bananas! Very good crust and appearance. I'm wrapping it in green saran wrap and giving it away as Christmas presents. Thank you!

I make banana bread all the time and I finally decided to look for a new recipe. Well, this one was the first I tried and THE BEST!! I did subsitute some sugar for splenda and used low-fat sour cream and still fantastic. My husband said I should use this recipe from now on (and he doesn't like change).

Great recipe. I divided everything in half, used two loaf pans and baked at 325 for 1hr 10min. I also sprinkled a sugar/cinnamon/brown sugar mixture over the top before baking. It gave it a little extra sweetness... yum yum!!

Good recipe...bread baked to perfection following recipe with no changes...however, I was a little disappointed because of all the reviews hyping it up and it was only what I would expect from a good banana bread, not beyond.  Again, recipe is perfect, just not anything different about this bread.

Perfect Banana Bread!  I printed this recipe out near the end of July, and have now made this bread at least six times and it is delicious every time!  I follow the recipe as is.  Very easy to make.  The batter yields enough for 2 regular sized loaves + 2 to 4 muffins.  I bake at 325 deg. for about an hour.  My family loves this recipe!

I tinkered with the recipe and was pleased with the results.  The butter was replaced with 1/4 cup of apple sauce and 1/2 cup of margarine/canola spread.  I used 2 cups of blueberry yogurt instead of sour cream.  Omitted the vanilla because I ran out.  The results were inhaled at a school lunch today.

DELISH-IOSO!! Brought this to the Hamptons & my uncle ate 1/2 of it in one day!! I cut the recipe in HALF, used 2 eggs, white whole wheat flour & organic sugar. I sprinkled the remaining sugar/cinnamon mixture on top. Baked it in a 9x9 dark coated pan for 50 min. Perfecto!!

This is everything the 5 star reviewers said it was... I was skeptical using cinnamon in the bread both on the outside coating and on the inside! It was spectacular!  I had no idea banana bread could be this good... I followed the recipe exactly even tho' I often change things.  If you haven't, you need to try this one!!

I was really skeptical about trying another banana bread recipe since I thought I had found the one, but after trying this one, I'll never use another recipe unless I have to (I don't always have sour cream). This bread was so moist and creamy. I halved the recipe, but used 2 eggs (didn't want to throw away half an egg!), I also used 2 tsp of baking soda instead of one to compensate for the extra egg. Also, I like brown sugar so I used 1/4 c. of it. Loved, loved, loved this banana bread!

I have never been able to get a moist tasting banana bread until this!  I have used up to 6 bananas in previous recipes, but I used only 3 in this one.. and my family loved it.  I did cut the recipe in half, and as suggested, added a crumb topping with pecans, brown sugar and butter.

The perfect banana bread recipe!  I like to change it up with minor variations such as leaving out the cinnamon etc. This last time I added raspberries to it.  So Good!

about 15 min. after i removed these from the oven, one entire loaf was gone -- the family raved about it and told me to enter a baking contest with this recipe!
i love the sugar/cinn. outer coating and plan on trying it on pumpkin bread and other pastries. 
THE best banana bread recipe ever!

Just took it to work today. Got comments that it was "blue ribbon" and the "best they'd ever had". Great recipe! Would definitely recommend! I cut the recipe in half and divided it in two disposable foil bread pans. Used light sour cream. The bread was almost too sweet - but much better than dried out-run-of-the-mill-banana bread. Thank you!

Oh my goodness!!!  I have used the same old banana nut bread recipe for the past ten years.  Knowing it was time for a change I chose this particular recipe...Boy, am I glad I did!  This one is absolutely scrumptious!!  Next time I will coat the pan with even more sugar and cinnamon, but that is about it.  I did turn it into three loaves in 5x9 pans.  Fantastic!!!

this bread is so awesome. People keep asking me how it's so moist, in reality I have no idea, but its really good. Although I did add more bananas cause I like them, and it was sweet but not too sweet, Im a sugarholic, so I added a little more than recommended, and I grilled a slice on butter, awesome for breakfast.

The banana bread was moist and tasty.  However as another reviewer warned, it was ALOT of batter.  Also, the finished bread was not all that attractive. My husband was hesitant to try it because it didn't look appealing but he agreed that it had a good taste.  I expected that cinnamon sugar coating to give it a crust but it actually made the bread kinda wet.  I gave this recipe 4 stars because I prefer the recipe I use from Betty Crocker using buttermilk, which has a better taste, less work and less batter.  I'll try the Creamy Banana Bread recipe with cream cheese next just to compare.

This is the best Banana Bread! I always get alot of compliments on it, and my daughter requests it often. The sour cream makes it very moist, and compliments the sweetness of the banana's. I probably use more banana's than called for , but just a little. Very yummy!

Unbelievable! This was so incredibly good that even my extra picky husband was all over it. I did make this with the Sugar/Splenda blend and substituted one cup of the flour for wheat flour. It still came out so moist and delicious! The smell alone was worth it. Definitely a permanent keeper.

This is a dense moist bread.  Dusting the pans with sugar gives it a wonderful crunch.

Simply delicious.  If you try making this one, you will find that you must save this recipe. I cut the recipe in half, so for the eggs I just beat 2 of them together in a bowl and then only used part of it.  I was making something else that needed to be dipped in egg anyway, so it worked out great.

Great recipe, both the family and friends truly enjoyed this banana bread.  Update:  I halved the recipe and made about 11 jumbo muffins.  It took about 25-30 minutes to cook.  Update 2: If halving the recipe use 2 eggs and 4 bananas.  At half the recipe it will make 12 regular size muffins and 6 jumbo muffins.  The regular muffins cooked in 28 minutes and the jumbo muffins cooked in 30 minutes.  I would start checking the muffins about 3 minutes before the time I have listed here.  Update 3: I halved the recipe, it made 3 regular size muffins and one 9x5 loaf.  The muffins cooked in 20 minutes and the loaf cooked in about 1hour and 10-15 minutes.  Also, I didn't throughly read the recipe and I did not cream the sugar with the butter.  Instead I mixed the butter in with the bananas and the other liquid ingredients.

This is a delicious recipe.  I have made it 3 different times, twice throwing in a 12 ounce bag of chocolate chips.  My family prefers the chocolate chip version, but then, we are chocoholics!  I use 2 small loaf pans, 4 x 8 and then one large 5 x 9.  Easy, moist and always a winner.  The cinnamon sugar coating on the outside of the bread is a great addition.  Thanks for sharing.

I used mascarpone instead of sour cream cream and it was utterly smooth. Everybody said it was better than any banana cake recipe they had ever had. I also sprinkled demerera sugar on top which gave it a wonderful sweet crunch on top.

I found this recipe in 1999 and use it every time I make banana bread! It always comes out moist and the cinnamon sugar dusting of the pans makes this recipe all the more mouth watering. It is fabulous right out of the oven and freezes wonderfully.

This recipe made me famous at the office. Follow as directed. Note that it probably takes about 15 minutes longer than listed to prepare, as you have to cream the butter and sugar and mash the bananas. EXCELLENT, don't change a thing!

3 cups white sugar is far too much, try 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  Added the nuts and one extra banana and had exactly enough to make 8 mini-loaves which cooked perfectly in one hour. To keep from having a soggy top the next day, store loaves with a few saltine crackers to absorb the extra moisure. 5 stars with the changes.

This bread was excellent! I think next time I'll add an extra banana since it tasted more like a coffee cake but it was sooooo moist and the cinnamon sugar coating was a nice touch. Doesn't get much better than this!

Excellent!  Made a few loaves to give out as Christmas presents and everyone loved them!  It's so simple and the batch made 2-3 loaves of the standard 8.5 x 4 in pan (I am not sure if the measurements are exact).  I added pecans instead of walnuts to mine.  Made a great breakfast and was a great way to dispose of all those over-ripe bananas hanging around!

I have been searching for the ultimate banana bread...and I think I've found it!  I made some changes to the recipe to suit my family's tastes, but overall, I think the changes are minimal.  We don't care for cinnamon or nuts in our banana bread, so I left that part out and included instead, 2 cups chocolate chipits.  I also only used 2 cups sugar, which was plenty sweet and swopped out one cup of flour for 1 cup of oats, trying to make them a little healthier after adding 2 cups chocolate!  Also, instead of making loaves, I made muffins, (got 30 good sized ones) baked at 300 for about 30-35 min.  This recipe is the bomb, thanks for sharing!

We love it, I have been making it for about three years. The only thing I do differently is double the amount of vanilla and add a small package of Nestle's mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. Also, I use pecans instead of walnuts about half the time.

It tasted a little like sour cream coffee cake, which overpowered the banana flavor a bit. Made 2 large & 1 small loaf.

Absolutely delicious! I coated the mini pans used with a cinnamon/sugar mixture and it gave a great addition. I also used ripe and not exactly ripe (split evenly and left some chunks of bananas in the mixture and added chopped pecans. It turned out perfect. However I had to bake about 15 minutes longer. Thank you for this delicious recipe!!

This makes a VERY moist bread. After reading some reviews I cut the sugar to 2 1/2 cups and that was plenty. I was a little disappointed in the mild flavor, I like a strong banana taste. However, my husband said it was the best I've ever made so I'll be making it again I'm sure. Maybe I'll try some banana extract as someone else suggested.

I made this tonight. I had 5 medium ripe bananas and 1 large regular banana on hand.
This came out wonderful! I was able to get 3 lg loaves and 4 mini loaves. I just bought the disposable foil loaf pans from Walmart and set them on a cookie sheet since they are kind of flimsy. I did lightly spray PAM into the pans before I did the cinnamon sugar coating. This is better than my mother in laws recipe.And I will bake this from now on. I was concerned with what another reviewer said about "to much sour cream" but honestly It diddnt taste at all tangy to me. Just delish! I do like more of a banana flavor, but that could be because my 1 banana wasnt fully ripe. I guess you could always throw in some banana extract or an extra small ripe banana. I plan on giving my mini loaves out to the neighbors. Thanks for a great recipe.

By far the best banana bread recipe I've tried.  I didn't need 4 loaves, so I cut the recipe in half.  I also used a combination of white and brown sugar like some of the other comments suggested.    Yum!

Loved this "bread". My husband raved. Really more like a cake though.  Very sweet and moist.  I will decrease the sugar to 2 1/2 cups instead of 3 next time I make it will be soon!!!! Great gift when made into small loaves.

By far the BEST banana bread I have ever made. I did it for Christmas last year and everyone I made it for asked for the recipe.  I also added semi sweet chocolate chips to a couple of loaves which was very popular too!

This was fantastic!  My new favorite recipe.  My husband, who thinks he makes the best banana bread ever even admitted that this one was better!  I love the cinnamon-sugar crust, too.  I did not add nuts, as that's my personal preference, and next time, I might try sprinkling a bit more of the cinnamon-sugar on top before baking.  Sooooo good!

I have found a new banana bread recipe!  It was so flavorful and moist.  Other recipes use oil to provide the moist texture and sometimes have an oily taste.  This is not a problem here, just great banana flavor coming through.  Coating the pans with cinnamon sugar added a nice contrasting texture.  I was worried that my loaves would stick but they came out fine.  I used 3 9 x 5" loaf pans and ended up with nice sized loaves. This one is a keeper!!

I've tried many different recipes for banana bread and think this one is something special.  The sour cream makes it very moist and it has lots of banana flavor.  Sprinkling the pans with cinnamon sugare was something new and I think it added a little something.  I didn't have any butter so I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 2 T of oil.  I scaled the recipe to 22 servings to get it to 4 bananas (what I had on hand) and 2 eggs.  Bake time was perfect.  The only suggestion I have is to cut back a little on sugar.  It is plenty sweet and I don't think it would hurt it to scale back a little.

This is a delicious banana bread. I've tried a lot of them and this will be the one I make from now on. I've adjusted the amounts here and there due to what I have on hand and it's been consistant every time. I use the toothpick to be the final judge for cooking time. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is my favorite banana bread.  I cut the recipe down to a 1/3 of all the ingredients call for.  This made one 4x8 loaf.  I cooked it for 1 HR and 8 minutes and it turned out great.  The house smells good and the bread is very moist!

OK, I really hate it when people change the recipe around drastically, and then give it a low rating because it didn't turn out.  That being said, I LOVE THIS RECIPE!  It is absolutely the best banana bread recipe I have ever used!  My kids love it.  Whenever I make it, it gets eaten in the first day or two.  I love the cinnamon sugar dusting; it gives it a little bit of texture on the crust.  WONDERFUL RECIPE!!!!

Great recipe--I too subbed half of the all purpose flour with whole wheat flour.  Really moist with yummy banana flavor.  I made 2 full size and 3 little loaves.  I put pecans in one, mini choc chips in one and left one plain--they were all devoured, but I liked the chocolate chip one best.  My 11 year old son said "Mom, this is the best thing you've ever made!"  That alone gets this recipe 5 stars for me!

Everyone who tastes it asks for the recipe before leaving!
It's a VERY sweet bread. You can definately cut the sugar from 3 cups to 2 cups and its still very sweet.

The very best banana bread we ever had. Sour cream makes this so moist, packed full of banana flavor. Cinnamon & sugar create a tasty crust.  My mother begs me to bake it.

Heavenly.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  If you're browsing allrecipes looking for a banana bread recipe, look no further.  It just doesn't get any better than this.  It's fine to modify a bit to fit your tastes (we add a bit of nutmeg, cloves, ginger, and allspice, since we like spices), but even as is, this is the PERFECT recipe.  Just amazing.  And it makes the house smell nice, as an added benefit :)

This recipe is super yummy!  I dont usually like banana bread that much because to me it seems very bland.  But the mixture of sour cream and cinnamon in this recipe makes it burst with flavor.  A definite must try!

This bread is amazing!!! I served it as a "personal card" to start my bakery business and everyone just loved it!!!  It has the perfect moist, the perfect flavor, it came out of the oven in 1hour 20minutes exactly and became a bit sank but even so it didn´t notice that much...THANK YOU ESTHER!!! this recipe is just per-fect.

It's a good, moist banana bread. I don't think the sour cream does anything for it flavorwise though. It didn't really taste any different than other banana breads I've made.

This is great banana bread.  Very, very moist.  The sour cream didn't make it really tangy - but it did taste smooth and very moist.  The cinnamon was a wonderful addition - just different enough.  I've made this 3 times in a week for different people - it's so good!

Very, very good!  My husband and I are extremely picky about banana bread, and this recipe delivered total perfection in our opinion.  I followed the recipe exactly...no changes required!  It's nice and moist, from the center to the edges.  I've tried about a dozen other banana bread recipes, and this has surpassed all of them.  Thanks!!

Very, very good. Not my all time favorite but this is a bread you can be proud to serve. I halved the recipe, making only one loaf. Thanks for the post.

Being from the South, sour cream is a staple in the kitchen. I never thought of using it in banana bread. It's amazing. It truly is. I bake quite frequently, and am *very* picky about recipes. This recipe, while supremely simple, is the *only* recipe I've used for banana bread for several years. It's delicious. The cinnamon sugar dusting on top is great if you want to make the bread tasted more like a dessert. Really, try it. You won't use any other recipe. It's fabulous.

This is excellent banana bread!  I halved the recipe and made one 9x5 loaf and had a little bit of batter left so made 7 or 8 mini muffins.  My husband, who claims not to like banana bread, scarfed down the muffins while the bread was still cooking.  He loves it!  If you use a bigger pan like I did, remember to bake it a little longer so it gets done in the middle.

I have tried several recipes and this one was the best. Even my "my moms is the best" husband loved it! I altered it a little, I cut the recipe in half, used 1/2 cup of butter instead of what would have been half, used 2 eggs, and 4 bananas because mine were only a little brown. I made 2 loaves, one was 8", the other was 8 1/2" the larger loaf took 15 min. longer and I added nuts and chocolate chips to that one. My family loved the cinnamon on the top and sides. I will use this recipe for holiday gifts and for our family recipe.

This is, by far, the BEST banana bread I have ever had!  I will never use another recipe again!  I served it at a brunch I hosted & my quests raved!  I was thankful it made so much, I had leftovers & I think I may have eaten an entire loaf myself.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

I made this for some diabetic friends, using Splenda in place of the sugar.  I should have used less Splenda, as it was too sweet.  Also, I made it in 3 large bread pans, and it did not seem to rise at all.  And maybe because of the Splenda, it did not brown at all.  I will make it next time like the recipe says, and come back with another review.

I should have written this review about two years ago as this was when I first used this recipe.  This is absolutely the best banana bread recipe ever.  My mother used to make banana bread for the family, now she comes to me to have me make it.  This is the only banana bread recipe I have used for the last two years and is probably the one I will pass on to my children.  Thanks for posting it!

This recipe makes a very moist and sweet banana bread.  My kitchen (whole house practicly) still smells amazing after baking this bread.  I halved this recipe and used 4 mashed bananas instead of 3, but everything else I did according to the recipe.  Also, after reading a previous review I filled my pans only 1/2 to 3/4 way up .... very glad I did because they definitely do rise!  Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this bread many times and each time I love it more. Baking time is longer than what the recipe states, but if you put less in the pans and use larger pans it will work out.

I have made this banana bread many times before but instead of the butter I added 1/4 cup vegetable oil. Makes the banana bread very moist.

This is by far the most wonderful banana bread!  I have used the same recipe (Made with buttermilk)for over 15 years and thought it was the best until I tried this ONE!  I toasted my pecans first and also used them in the 'dusting mixture', I also used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and sprinkled some of top of each loaf.  This will definitely be made again and again....Pat, East Texas

I loved this recipe so much I printed it out and gave it to my friends at work! The only thing I did different was used less flour (by accident) and didn't dust the pans with the cinnamon and sugar. It was wonderful!

My mother has been putting sour cream in her coffee cake for years and it is the moistest cake ever.  I should have known it would work for other baked goods also.  Great bread!  Next time I will sprinkle extra brown sugar/cinnamon all over the top.  Good stuff!

I've made this bread a few times, and it's very good,  but I didn't find that the sour cream really made all that much difference... my husband has eaten it a few times, and says it's Banana Bread... pure and simple. I guess I was expecting this to be spectacular.

This recipe was very good.  I used fat free sour cream, and only 4 bananas, and it was still moist and delicious.  The recipe made 8 mini loaves, not the 4 indicated in the recipe, so I was able to share the wealth!

This recipe i give high marks. Sweet it is. Sent a loaf to the school stuff, I was told they inheld it.  Make sure you use rip bananas, the ones that the skin has turned brown. They make for a better banana favior.

This is the best banana bread in the world! I've baked lots of banana bread (including Mrs. Field's recipe) and haven't found anything better. I always tweek a recipe to my liking but leave this one alone. Family and friends moan in ecstacy when I serve this.  Thank you, Esther, for sharing.

Great recipe! I made it yesterday with bananas and sour cream. Today I made it with 3 cups of pureed sweet potatoes in place of the bananas, buttermilk in place of the sour cream, and 1/2 tsp. ginger, 1/4 tsp. cloves and 1/8 tsp. nutmeg in addition to the cinnamon. Sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before baking. I got 10 mini loaves out of each recipe and they came out terrific!!

Used 1¼ C white sugar and ½ C of dark brown sugar and Nonfat sourcream, super ripe (blackened)bananas. Very moist and brown.
Thanks =-)

Simple to make--even for this cooking novice.  The bread is moist, not too sweet, and so good toasted.

My 10 year old daughter baked this recipe for us. It is by far one of the best Banana Bread we've ever eaten.Rich and moist. She added chocolate chips to one of the loaves.

I was really excited to make this bread after reading all the rave reviews. Unfortunately, it didn't turn out as I had expected.  The bread came out very "light," I like dark banana bread.  I was moist, but didn't have very much flavor.  I probably won't make this again. I am still searching for the perfect recipe!

This was is a fabulous tasting banana bread-very moist and sweet.  This made 5 little loaves and one big loaf.  I mixed in chocolate chips with a half batch and my husband ate the whole mini-loaf!

It is very good. The best part is dusting the baking pans with cinnamon and sugar, however the bread is slightly dense and wet. The flavor is phenomenal though! Definitely worth making.

This is absolutely the best tasting recipe ever.  I halfed it, which after I made it I wished I wouldn't have.  I made one with walnuts and one with chocolate chips. I think this would be the ultimate with both walnuts and chocolate chips.  The two 9 x 5 loaves were gone by the next day.  I don't think I'll bother trying any others.  The sour cream makes this! YUMMY!

This recipe was wonderful! I brought it to a ladies "non-superbowl party" and they loved it!! I had a small problem finding a 7x3 loaf pan, so I substituted an 8x4 and still came out with 4 nice size loaves.

I would strongly recommend only very disciplined individuals make this banana bread because if your not careful you could EASILY eat all 7 loaves before it has completely cooled.  You have been warned!   This is my new banana bread recipe, thank you for sharing Esther Nelson, and yes I did manage to freeze a few loaves.

I made these into mini loaves for my coworkers for Christmas.  They turn out wonderful!  I gave a loaf to my mother, who just happened to receive another loaf from a friend.  We ate from the two and there was no comparison.  This recipe had better flavor and was much, much moister.  Hint: Use a large bowl, the average mixing bowl will not be large enough - Thank you for the recipe.

This is the best banana bread ever, and I've made alot of them.  It's very tender and moist.  I halved the recipe, and it made one 9x5" loaf (67 minutes at 300) and two mini-loaves (50 minutes at 300).  I added chocolate chips to the mini-loaves, and they were wonderful.  THANK YOU!  I always wonder why I try new recipes for old standbys.  Now I know!

Made 24 muffins from this recipe, plus a separate loaf.  Turned out so light, but moist!  The sugar-cinnamon on the bottom of each muffin was especially nice!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I made 18 petite loaves from one recipe and will give them as Chistmas gifts.  I only used 2 cups of sugar and the sweetness was just right.

I'm not a real lover of walnuts, so I substituted pecans and raisins. I made 4 loaves for Christmas, however, it was so good I have to bake it all over again. I can't keep anyone away from it. Thanks for all your wonderful recipes.

If I could live on Banana Bread alone this would be the recipe to make me want nothing more.  My whole family loved this. So rich with great flavor and texture.  Wonderful!

THIS IS THE BEST RECIPE YET, THE SOUR CREAM MAKES IT SO MOIST, VERY TRUE IT WOULD MAKE A GOOD LITTLE GIFT. DUSTING THE BREAD PAN WITH SUGAR AND CINNAMON IS ALSO A PLUS......EXCELENT.......

I have to say, I "rarely" ever do a review, but I just had to on this one.  I am a novice baker, but decided to try this recipe as the couple others I tried long ago turned out too dry.  This is is not dry at all and like the creator said, Melts in your mouth!  The only changes I did were to the loaf pans.  I wanted mini loaves for gifting.  I did 5 of those and 1 large one.  I WILL make again, but I will try and figure out how to scale back the amount and make all mini loaves.  It will make it easier to freeze also.  :)

This was very flavorful recipe.  I agreed with other reviewers, 3 cups is a lot of sugar.  I reduced it to 1 3/4 and it was just right.  I substituted unflavored homemade yogurt that I always have handy for the sour cream.  I also used frozen bananas which I also keep in supply.  The yogurt and thawed bananas made for a very runny batter.  I got 6-6" x 3" mini loaves and some pans overflowed.  Next time, I will reduce the yogurt to  1.5 cups from 2.  I reduced fat by using parchment paper to line the pans instead of greasing with butter.  Then, I used the cinnamon sugar for topping instead of lining the pan.  It made the top look pretty, shiny and crackly  when done.  The loaves looked underdone after 1 hour so I baked an extra 10 minutes.  Next time, I might try to bake at 325 F.  As promised, the bread is melt-in-mouth moist. I like the mini loaves because I can freeze what I don't use right away to keep it fresh.  I will definitely be making this again.

I cut this recipe in half because I only had 3 bananas.  My bread was done at 55 minutes. My husband said, " Eew, sour cream, I'm not eating that!" However, when the banana bread came out of the oven, he ate two pieces. My husband gave this banana bread 5 stars!

I made this just today and it came out perfect! I think I've baked about 3 things in my lifetime (just never got into baking) but this recipe was super easy and I read the reviews and changed it up a little. I made the whole recipe but used 5 very ripe bananas instead of 6. I also used only 2 cups of white sugar and replaced the 3rd cup with 1 cup of brown sugar. I noticed that almost everyone baked at 325 degrees so I did that for an hour, then covered my loaf with aluminum foil and baked it for an additional 15 minutes. It came out perfect! I had enough for 2 loaves in a 9x5 inch loaf pan. The remaining batter I used a muffin tin and made banana muffins. I baked at 400 degrees for 18 mins and they turned out perfect! Super yummy and moist and I'll definitely  be making this again!

Best banana bread recipe I have tried. Everyone loved it. It's moist, has a wonderful texture and flavor, not overly sweet. I think the secret is the sour cream. Yummy! I sprinkled the top of each loaf with a combo of finely chopped nuts, coarse sugar and cinnamon before baking.  I substituted pecans for the walnuts.   I had to bake at about 335  degrees and for about an hour and a half in my oven which always seems to need more time than recipes usually state. But I think 300 degrees is unrealistic for this recipe.
This recipe makes four 3x7 loaves. I wrapped the extra loaves in foil and put them in the refrigerator for a couple days. What do you know? Three more banana bread occasions came up and I was prepared!  The refrigerated loaves were fresh and perfect even after 3 days in the fridge. So now as I type, I'm baking another batch for a community potluck and for work. 
I'm a beginning baker who loves to try easy recipes and bring my experiments to work. This recipe fit my repertoire.

Everyone loves this recipe when I make it. I actually make 4 - 9 x 5" loaves. I drop the temp to 325 degrees and bake it for 1 hour.  It makes great gifts or treats for the office as well.

I turn to this recipe over and over. I love that it makes several small loaves. My kids can't get enough. I leave out any nuts for them, but I have tried adding mini chocolate chips, which is a yummy alternative. The coating makes it extra special. One of the only recipes that didn't come passed down from my mother that I ever use. You must try it! But make sure you bake it long enough. Sometimes I leave it on for an extra 5 minutes or so.

I'm not really sure how this turned out so well....but it did. The best! The reason I say that is because after an hour of cooking on the correct temperature ( & having followed the recipe), the entire middle of each was a goopy mess that was even bubbling over in some spots (thank goodness I baked them over a cookie sheet). So, thinking it was a total loss anyway, I cranked the heat up on my oven to about 450 degrees for the next 30 minutes. And...the loaves turned out amazing. Perfectly baked, soft and moist and perfectly delicious. Yeah! Thank you so much for sharing this beautiful banana bread recipe!

This was an excellent banana bread recipe.  I like that it recognized spices like cinnamon add to the taste.  I also added nutmeg, cloves and pumpkin pie spice to the flour mix.  I think I will lower the sour cream content next time though.

For those with temperature issues, I would suggest looking at your loaves about 5-10 minutes after they have been in the oven.  If the center is rising faster than the edges your temperature is TOO LOW.  If your edges are rising faster than your center, your temperature is TOO HIGH.  Adjust your temp accordingly and then look at it 5-10 minutes later to see if the top is now flat rather than uneven.  

With people altering sugar content,  sour cream and baking soda amount, number of bananas, etc, it's best to just monitor the bread for a bit in the beginning to get the temp right.  It just so happens 300 degrees for 1 hour 5 minutes was right for my two loaves (half recipe).  I use the skewer coming out clean method to determine doneness.

Those with gooey centers that were inedible but the sides were done, your heat was too high.  

That said, I think I will try Martha Stewart's recipe next.  She doesn't have cinnamon in it so I will add that but I do think her proportions of sour cream etc is more along what I like.  She cooks it at a higher temp and I like that too because I like the "done" taste.  Maybe it's the combo of a lot of sour cream and the low temp but this recipe's bread sat "heavy" in my tummy.  Still was tasty though!

Followed the recipe exactly and this came out perfectly.  The only thing I can add is a tip.  The bread will rise more than twice the depth of the raw batter as it sits in the pan so plan accordingly.  I like a lot of crust so the huge bloom over the top of the pan height wasn't a problem, at all.  Just be aware that it does rise a bit more than usual for banana bread recipes.

I questioned the suggested oven temp. of 300 & didn't feel it was high enough, so I baked the loaves at 350 & they turned out great. (I checked a few other recipes & found 350 degrees to be given.) The loaves were very moist & delicious. My husband said it was the best banana bread he's ever had.  I used smaller pans & made 7 loaves from this recipe; some to give away, some to eat & some to freeze. Definitely a keeper, just remember to adjust the oven temp!

Amazing and Easy!  I give this bread away regularly because I have a lot of bananas go bad.  Everyone at family holidays expects me to bring it.  I never really indulge that it has sour cream in it.  To me that's kind of a "Secret ingredient".  I have had great success making this recipe a Gluten Free dessert.  I just substituted all-purpose GF flour blend for the regular and added 3 tsp of xanthan gum to the full batch.  No one has ever known ths difference.  And I like to make this bread a tad healthier than the recipe.  Natural sugar is so much better for you than "white death", so I keep all the bananas, maybe sometimes add one or two and cut the "white" sugar down to 1 3/4 cups.  My husband loves sugar and quickly steals an entire loaf for himself when they are done, so my guess is that the white sugar is not missed.

I scaled this down to 10 servings (as I had 2 ripe bananas to use up) and made it into muffins instead. Baked them at 300 degrees for 26 minutes. Had some batter left, so made some mini muffins as well, which those baked up in 15 minutes. Super light, and super moist! A great banana bread recipes. Will make again.

I will tell you that I always make the recipe as directed the first time. The second, I tweek, the third, I make final changes.
I have made this bread almost a hundred times over the past 2 years. I became motivated when I told someone I make raw desserts. He asked if I made banana bread; I did not. My challenge began. By the 7th or 8th batch, I began to make the bread Gluten-free and vegan. I subbed Bob's Mill all-purpose flour, tofutii sour cream, apple sauce (another recipe I got from here: Slow cooked spiced apple sauce), and 8 bananas instead of stated in recipe. One extra because, why not, and the 8th, I cut into diced pieces and throw in at end of mixing stage. I cut sour cream down because of extra bananas. The tub is 12 oz, I use about 6-7oz. I had started to sell my bread. I love it! It is amazing! Any questions, please let me know. (I'm not vegan, I just wanted to make it safe for everyone :-)

Amazing recipe!  My husband and son can't get enough. Had to bake it a little longer but other than that it was great. The extended time was because no two ovens are the same

A doughy mass! Stayed up half the night to bake it! I took the advice of another comment and halved this, making two loaves.  I then cooked it at 325 for 1 hour 10 minutes (per comment).  Really, I should know better, most banana recipes I've tried cook at 350.  After looking at it baked an additional 35 minutes at 325. After looking at THAT, cooked it at 350 for 15 minutes. Still doughy.  No, nothing wrong with oven.  And it has something pink in the dough I'm a bit concerned about.  Perhaps I should have split it into 3 loaves.

I prefer the Banana Banana Bread recipe over this one. I added chocolate chips (coated in flour so they don't sink).  It was a little cakey, even though I followed reviewers advice to fold in the flour instead of using a mixer.  I also used 10 mini loaf pans for this recipe as gifts.  It did come out okay; I just didn't like it as much as the other recipe.

I used 4 aluminum "throw away" 8 x 4 pans and baked at 315 degrees for 1 hour.  I only had 5 bananas, so I decreased the flour, sugar and sour cream accordingly. This recipe is a KEEPER!

Outstanding! I followed the directions (minus the nuts) and added a sprinkling of the left over cinnamon/sugar mix on top before baking. My batch made three loaves. Baked 70 minutes at 300 degrees and they all came out perfect! Kids and friends went crazy over it. Best banana bread over ever had!

I did three loaves and 6 muffins.  It's the best banana bread I've ever had and I love that there's no oil.  It took over an hour for some of my larger loaves.  Can't wait to freeze some and pull it out as a gift or treat later on.

This was a great recipe.  I didn't have sour cream so used plain greek yogurt, it came out fantastic.  My daughter asked for it for breakfast lunch and supper lol, the ultimate test for recipes.  I added chocolate chips just because I could ;)

Oh my goodness this is the best banana bread I've ever had in my life!!!  I went to Walmart to buy a couple loaf pans because I didn't have any to make this recipe.  Well they didn't have the size called for or the size used in a popular review all they had was Mainstays Bread and Loaf Pan with Handles 8.5"L x 4.5"W x 2.75"H.  The good news is they were only 88 cents.  Having to take a swag I decided to buy three and it turns out it was the perfect choice.  I baked the three loaves at 325 for 75 minutes and wow -amazing! :-)

I followed the direction's, as I believe people should when there's rating to do. This bread is fabulous!! My family loves it and our kids want me to make cup cakes with the batter next time. This is going to be Christmas gifts to a lot of friends.

I have had this receipe for several years. It's the best banana bread ! I've used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, added more bananas, added amaretto in place of vanilla and all is wonderful. It's a keeper to be passed down in the family.

Second time I made it I substituted 1/2 cup brown sugar for the white sugar to give it a deeper color.  I also added 1/8 tsp more salt because I use unsalted butter.  You don't need to make these changes because the first batch was WONDERFUL just as is.

Excellent and very moist.   I used less sugar 2-2.5 cups.   I am going to try substituting plain yogurt for the sour cream next time.

This was a simple,  easy to make, fantastic banana bread!  I made it according to the recipe but instead if making a bunch if mini loaves,  I made one big 11x15 banana cake.  I cooked it at 350 for about 90 mins,  and it was excellent, super moist, and perfect density.  Everyone enjoyed it so much, they made me make another!

LOVE this recipe it is a family favorite, here are my modifications: 
1/2 cup less sugar,
1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg,
1/2 teaspoon of allspice,
pre heat oven @ 350 then turn down to 325 to cook. I put tinfoil around edges for 50 min, remove foil and bake for another 5 - 10 min 
I use 8in X 3 3/4 in X 2 1/2 in EZ foil pans it makes 4 loafs

An excellent recipe. I didn't have enough sour cream so I made up the difference with Greek yogurt and no sugar added apple sauce. They were a huge hit.

This was delicious!     Sometimes banana bread is dry.  Not this recipe.  We ate it while it was still warm and 
everyone kept sneaking more pieces from the kitchen.   I left out the nuts because I didn`t any. 
Also I adjusted the serving size to make just one loaf, and it was wonderul.   I think the sour cream is the "wink-wink" on this recipe.  Thanks!!!!!!

OMG... Is all I can say. I've made it several times, great results each time. I used stevia instead of sugar + I added 1/2 tsp baking powder as well. This is super moist.. My oven temp was set at 325*

This is a great banana bread recipe, very moist and tasty. I like making the little loaves so and giving them as gifts. It is also really good when you put a slice on the grill for a bit and serve with a little ice cream.

Loved it! Made recipe as written minus the nuts and only used 5 bananas since they were pretty large. My pans were larger than stated, I used 1 9x5 pan and 3 8x4 pans, and had plenty of batter to fill all four. I baked at 300 for 75 minutes. I checked at 60 but they were still wet in the middle. An extra 15 minutes and they came out great. The tops weren't burnt and the middles were cooked through. This was my first attempt at banana bread and this is the recipe I will be the one I will continue using.

This was delicious! Followed the recipe EXACTLY (but cut the servings in half since I only had 3 ripe bananas)and it was so moist and light. The best banana bread Ive ever made. I strongly suggest that the walnuts be added if you like walnuts at all; they added a flavorful crunch. And dusting the pan with cinnamon sugar gave it a sweet thin crust. BUT one warning; unless Ive got the wimpiest, most contrary oven ever, when I set it at 300 degrees it just wasn't enough to cook it in one hour. After testing it at one hour I had to add another 25 minutes before it was done. But it was worth it....

This is the absolute best recipe for banana bread.  I have been told that it's the best ever. I always follow the recipe exactly with no changes needed.

Update: substitute  1 cup of brown sugar  for  1 cup of white  sugar. I've been  told  that it's the best banana bread ever!

We have nut allergies in the family, so I make this sans nuts.  I also use the topping SaraLady19 recommended - I think this is the best banana bread we've had.  Easy to make with the KitchAid mixer - this recipe makes two large loaves and two small loaves.

Update:  Have made this three times more, again sans nuts but with SaraLady19's topping.  I took two loaves to the office - to a person, everyone said it was the best banana bread they had ever had.  I've only favorited some of the dozens of recipes I've tried on allrecipes.com and reviewed few - this one tops all.

I have been looking for a new banana bread recipe and I have found it. My old one ALWAYS turned out too done around the edges and since I had a container of sour cream about to expire I decided to try this one. I did not dust my pans with the cinnamon sugar though. I also have larger loaf pans then what this called for so I made 3 loaves instead of 4. This bread was so moist! This was some of the best banana bread I think i have ever had!  Reading through some other reviews I wanted to add that I baked my 3 loaves at 300 for an hour like the recipe called for and they we perfect.

Awesome! Egg-free (allergy)-added a couple extra tablespoons of sour cream.  The crunchy topping from Zuchini Bread IV - fabulous! I bake it at 325 degrees one 9 x 7 pan (30-60 mins) and 5 individual pans 20-30 mins. checking with toothpick regularly. Got fabulous reviews

Recipe turned out just like everyone else said, moist and delicious!  I followed the recipe size and was able to get about 20 small loaves (4.7inX2.4in) since I only have a 6 cavity loaf pan.  I am going to cut the recipe in half next time, but it worked out well this time to give to neighbors.

I gave this a 5 star but I am rating it according to my alterations. First of all, I used 2 1/2 cups white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of 3 cups white sugar. I reduced the sour cream down to 8 ounces instead of 16 ounces. The bread remained moist but not wet or under baked in the centre & I did not have problems like a lot of others said they experienced. I added 1/2 cup raisins to my batter. Everything else I kept the same. The next time I think I will leave out the sugar / cinnamon dusting for the pans, for me it is just a little too sweet & I feel it distracts from the overall flavour of the bananas. All in all this is a really good recipe. A keeper. Happy baking!!!

Delicious! I found, like a few others, that I took a lot longer to cook than the time notes on the recipe. After the hour, I increased the temp to 325 and cooked it for another half an hour.

The loaf was far too sweet and it refused to cook in the middle no matter how much extra time I cooked it for. Had some better luck when I put the rest of the batch into muffin tins, but still not a hit.

Made as written with 2 cups of walnuts and it was excellent!! This will be my go to for banana nut bread / muffins and I have tried many a recipe. I made muffins with a crumb topping for work, this recipe yields 36 muffins with the additional nuts bake at 325 for 25 mins. Perfection!!

Crumb mixture: 
1 1/2 c oats, 2/3 c brown sugar, 1/4 c melted butter, 1/4 c chopped walnuts. Mix until crumbled top muffins prior to baking.

I made HALF a batch into 6 jumbo muffins and had enough leftover to fill a mini-loaf pan. Cooking time for these was 25 min. I used two eggs and also added 2 TBSLP of ground flaxseed. I cut back as I always do on the sugar by about 1/4 cup (used some brown sugar, too). I combined the dry ingredients (except cinnamon...recipe had it going in with the eggs...sure it would be fine to add with other dry ingred). A little low on sour cream so topped that off with plain Greek yogurt. I did not add nuts into the batter but did make a streusel topping to which I added them. I tried something different and added about six coarsely chopped, mini dark chocolate peanut butter cups from Trader Joe's. Oh my...just enough to put these over the top! I highly recommend this recipe! Thanks Esther!

Best ever!! I did the topping suggested by sarahlady19. Turned out great. Very moist. Best banana bread I have ever made. I also cut the recipe in half for two loaves instead of four.  And I also cooked the loaves at 325F for 1 hr and 10 mins.

Baked one loaf with the sugar cinnamon floured glass pan and one without. The greased pan without the cinammon mixture stuck in the pan and the other one with did not.  I made half the recipe using 3/4 c sugar and made 2 loaf pans and baked for 50 min. and they were done. Very good.

This was the best banana bread recipe, EVER.  I did add some my own personal favorites. I made two loaves, instead of 4 and used 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour and 1/2 white all purpose flour. I used baking Stevia in the Raw, instead of sugar 1 cup. I added more walnuts,vanilla and cinnamon than the recipe called for and I added chocolate chips so my picky son would try it.  Delicious and soooo moist.  Will do it this way again.

I made a third of this recipe and used my mini muffin tin. A third of this recipe fills one mini muffin tin with 24 spaces. Fill the spaces just about to the top. In addition to cinnamon, I added a healthy dose of ground cloves and ground nutmeg, both of which go nicely with banana. I also used two and a half bananas, or use two large bananas. I baked at 350 degrees for 18 minutes.

I had only 4 over ripe bananas left over to  toss (I hate any black on my 'nanas!).  I've used 6, three times before! The "sour cream" makes it!.  IT IS TO DIE FOR!  Sans nuts. Hubby doesn't like nuts.  But oh, I can just imagine it with nuts!  Make this!  Right now!  I usually freeze three tins and eat one right away. Next time I will add nuts in two of them before freezing and labeling them!

This is the best recipe for banana bread I've tried yet! We loved it! I halved the recipe and baked in an 8x4 pan. I raised the oven temperature to 325 and it took about an hour and 20 minutes to bake.

Wonderful! kids love this. We use our own cultured sour cream or milk kefir. This has been among our favorites for years. Usually we only make it for the holidays. 
P.S. 
Make sure you take it out when it is a tad uncooked in the middle.

We loved this recipe. We live in Boulder, CO and I add 1/4c flour to almost all my baking recipes because of the higher elevation.  I was very leary of cooking at 300 so I upped it to 325 for 50 minutes and checked after that. It was very moist, great flavor and the kiddos at it up!

FANTASTIC RECIPE. If you don't have allergies to any ingredients, this is the ONLY banana bread recipe. There is a reason it's rated so highly. It made me feel like a baking queen when I made it. I cut it in half and used one pan. I also had sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on the top to make a light crisp for the top, and I had to substitute baking powder for soda. Still phenomenal. I did two eggs instead of one and a half, and I guessed on the sour cream because I had already gotten into it. Also my cooking time because I used one large pan instead of the minis was 1hr 15min. Good luck. Enjoy.

This recipe is so fantastic, my husband finished 2 loafs in a day! I didn't want to make too many loafs so I halved the ingredients and only made 2. Instead of using loaf tins, I made this recipe using the baking function on my rice cooker (ended up looking more like a cake than a loaf haha) and it turned out perfect after 60mins (crispy on the outside and spongy/moist in the inside). It is honestly THE best banana bread/cake we have ever tasted!

I've made this several times and always get told it's the best ever!  Once you make it this way, there's no going back. 

Because we have a convection oven, I bake it at 325° for 1-1.25 hrs. I think the bananas make the difference in cooking time, but I could be wrong. The recipe is great as is, but I add 1tsp of nutmeg and 1 1-2 tsp baking powder.  Truly, you'll make a banana bread better than your grandma, so be prepared to face the consequences!

I made some changes based on what I had in the house. I was short 1/4 of butter, so I used mayo. I am sure I added in extra bananas, since I used whatever I had (probably 7 or 8), thew in vanilla and cinnamon without measuring. Sugar was half white, half turbinado (Sugar in the Raw). I ended up doing 2 brownie pans of bread, one tray of 24 cupcakes, and one tray of muffin tops. At 300, muffin tops were done in 30 min and muffins in about 40/45. Rest were good at about 70 minutes.  They tasted great. I love sour cream in anything, though! I added about a cup or so of chocolate chips, also. I am sure I will make it again for Thanksgiving and Christmas time and will change it up based on what I have in the house.

Definitely my new go-to banana nut bread recipe! The sour cream made it 10x more moist than a recipe without it. I cut the recipe in half, and baked 2 loaves at 300 for an hour and 15 min. Turned out great and my family loved it. :)

I was a bit sceptical of this recipe as I have made banana bread before and they have always turned out terrible. But I had sour cream and bananas to use up so I thought i'd give it one last try. I'm so glad I did. This turned out wonderfully well. I followed the recipe exactly except I only used 5 bananas (I only had 5 on hand) and 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon ( I don't like strong cinnamon tastes). I did do a double take when i saw the temperature setting, 300 seemed a bit low but I set it at that anyway, and yep they rose well. I had to leave them in there about 10 mimutes longer than stated though. They looked fantastic when I took them out of the oven and smelt great. I was getting ready for the dissapointing taste but no, it tasted great too. I still can't believe I have found a banana bread recipe I like and turned out so well. Thank you Esther for the fantastic recipe!

Hard to rate when I changed the recipe so much but it came out great. I halved the recipe and wanted to make it a little more healthy. 
Two eggs, 3/4 cup of sugar and a dollop of molasses, 1 cup of white flour and 1/2  cup of whole wheat flour, 1/4 stick of butter only and 1/4 cup of applesauce. Added a handful each of ground flax and whole flax and chia seeds. Bumped the spices way up and added cloves, nutmeg and allspice. All other ingredients were just halved. Used reduced fat sour cream. Used almonds as it was the only nuts I had.  At 1 hour and 20 minutes, I turned off the oven and let it rest in there for another 10-15 minutes.  This banana bread came out so moist and slightly dense, it was more like a cake. Even better after a day in the fridge. I was afraid of how long it was taking to cook at that low heat but it came out perfect. I froze one and can't stop nibbling at the other one!

Very moist and delicious! We added some chocolate chips to it.  It did take 1hr 15mins to bake through and only made three loaves at the 4 loaf directions. But we were very pleased with it and will definitely be using this recipe again and again and again. Oh, I was out of baking soda so instead did 4 tsp baking powder and omitted the salt. Worked great!

This was very good.  I too have 9x5 so I upped the heat to 350, set the time at 60.  Perfect timing.  Great taste and I didn't not do an pan prep (non-stick breadpan).  Nor did I top the bread.  Will definitely repeat.

This recipe is perfectly moist. I made half a batch, but followed everything exactly. The only exceptions were that I added a dash of nutmeg, 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, & 3/4 cup of walnuts! So great!

Made twice; once following recipe exactly and once with a few changes; following recipe was great, just a little too gooey.  Changes I made were subbing one cup of the white sugar for brown sugar and sprinkled a little sugar/cinnamon on top too. And cooked at 325. I only gave 4 stars because only a "no change needed" recipes gets a 5:)

After tweaking the bread recipe by reviews the bread came out much better.
325 seems to be a much better degree than 300 which left it mushy.

This was the best!!  I only had about 12 oz of sour cream so I added two extra bananas and it was great. I also made banana bars and cooked them about 35 min.

I had a bunch of bananas I wouldn't eat and some light sour cream in my fridge so I searched recipes and found this one.  I didn't have the nuts and I added a crumble top for texture but everything else stayed the same.  My bf took a loaf to work this morning and told me he wasn't sharing it and my coworkers ate another 2 loaves at work today.  I don't even LIKE bananas or banana bread but I will eat this.  A keeper!

So moist and delicious! I love the cinnamon sugar pan coating. Tried this in my convection bake oven, manufacturer says to reduce temp by 25 degrees, so cooked at 275 but then took much longer than an hour. Cut the recipe in half (used an egg white for the half egg) with no issues.

I made this recipe  with the exact amount of everything specified,  except I put in 1 tsp cinnamon,  1/2 tsp ground cloves,  and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg instead of 2 tsp of cinnamon. I also think it could use 2 tsp of salt instead of 1. I made it in Reynolds 2 1/2 inch foil baking cups sitting on a cookie sheet at 325 for 30 minutes and they came out perfect. I also dusted the walnuts with a cinnamon sugar and butter and just put them on top before baking instead of in the batter.

Took the advice of others and cut the white sugar to 1-1/2 cups and added 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Where we live we have Apple Bananas growing everywhere, so that was the type of banana I used.  They are smaller than the regular bananas you get in the food store so I used all I had on hand which was 8.  I thought I had plenty of sour cream but was a bit short of the 16 ounces.  So to make up for the lesser amount of "wet" ingredients I added 1/3 cup of coconut cream that I had left over in the fridge.  Sprinkled the tops of the three loaves (which is all I got out of the recipe)with cinnamon sugar.  Oh boy, this was so good when it was warm and so good the next morning toasted and buttered.  Moist and fluffy and not too sweet.  Going to try again with the next batch of bananas but this time I am going to add lilikoi or guava to it since they are going off right now, too.

This is the best banana bread I have ever made!  I cut the sugar amount in half, and used about half whole wheat flour.  I was short of sour cream so put in some plain yogurt also.  My family finished 2 loaves in a day and begged for more.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I have been looking for a great banana bread for a long time, and I had one recipe I used a long time.  That recipe pales in comparison.  I followed it exactly.  My husband is raving about it right now.  He ate a full mini-loaf.  I did use small loaf pans instead and made 5 small loaves with a 2/3 recipe.  I only had 4 bananas.  Yeah!  Great recipe.  I don't know why people think they need to change recipes and add this or that.  This one is perfect the way it is, and I agree that using fat-free or low-fat sour cream won't work the same way because the fat in the sour cream is to replace oil, which is in every banana bread recipe.  I would rather put in sour cream, real stuff with all of the fat, than add oil to a recipe.

This is a pretty great recipe. It makes a lot of bread and it is fairly simple. The bread is incredibly moist even though the crust that forms on top is a little deceiving of that. I love it and my husband will easily go through all four loaves if I let him.

This recipe is amazing! It's a total hit and I make it all the time. I add a bag of Nestle Mini semi sweet Morsels and people rave about it. I also use large loaf pans so mine makes 3 good size loaves.. I sometimes will freeze a loaf for serving later. They freeze great!

One of the best banana bread recipes I have ever made.

This is a REALLY good Banana Bread recipe!  Note, I didn't have enough sour cream so I sub'd 8oz of fat free plain greek yogurt and it turned out GREAT! At altitude (5120') I think I would up the baking temp to 325F next time to avoid the danger of a doughy center in bigger loaves.

This banana bread is simply the best.  It is so moist and flavorful it reminded me of my grandma's.  As I am diabetic I substituted half of the sugar with Splenda® and half with dark brown sugar.  I think I will cut the total sugar amount down to 2 cups as it was plenty sweet.  I did increase the baking temperature to 325 as suggested by other reviewers, and it came out perfect though it did take a bit longer than stated.  I think this is a reflection of my oven's accuracy though as the bread did not get overly browned.  I will definitely make this again.  As this recipe makes a lot, it will be great for making multiple smaller loaves for gift giving, like at Christmas time.  My family is nutty but don't care to eat them, so I added raisins to part of the batter and made muffins out of it.  They grabbed them as they ran out the door.  A huge hit with the entire family.

I got very frustrated making this bread, and I thought I'd never make it again. However, once it came out of the oven, the bread is so good--moist and just sweet enough. I'll have to make it again! However, my very large mixing bowl almost overflowed--I wondered if my bananas were too large. I had so much batter! I used four 6X2 loaf pans and then figured I would put the extra batter in 6 muffins. I ended up filling 18 muffins and not having room in my oven for all of them. I started cooking them at 300 degrees, but I began to question the temp and so checked the reviews and decided to turn it up to 325. The loaves took 1 hr, while the muffins took 30 min at 325. Next time, I will make 2 large loafs instead. :)

Fantasic recipe!  This has replaced the banana bread recipe from my grandmother that I used my whole life!  I usually half the recipe to make 2 loaves. I use 2 eggs for 1/2 recipe and increase the flour by 1 cup. I have used both sour cream and fat free plain greek yogurt and the bread turns out great either way. I have used walnuts, pecans and even mini chocolate chips as add ins. It take about 1 hour 15 minutes to bake at 300 degrees in my oven.  It is so delicious!

Made a few substitutions to reduce fat and calories:  Cut recipe in half then used the following: Replaced all sugar with Stevia, replaced 3/4 cup butter with 1 apple (sauced) + 1.5 T butter, 2 eggs, replaced sour cream with Nonfat Greek Yogurt and used 2.5 Cups Whole Wheat flour.  Replaced Walnuts with Pecans.  All other ingredients kept the same.  Baked at 325 for 70 min.  Dusted top with Cinnamon + stevia.  DELICIOUS!!!

I have tried several of these banana bread recipes and this is by far the best. I'm not crazy about the taste of bananas in recipes, so I use 1 cup mashed bananas and 1 cup applesauce.  There's just a hint of banana flavor to the bread and it's delicious. I also use pure cane sugar with the cinnamon to coat the pans - mmmmmm.  Nanlynn

Made it today.  The only thing I did differently was I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream because I didn't have any.  It's a fantastic recipe as written.  Mahalo!

Great banana bread recipe! The best loaf I've ever made! I followed the recipe the first time and it was really good. The next time I reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups, used 3 cups WW flour and 1.5 cups ground old fashioned oats instead of the all purpose flour that is called for. Even better with the substitutions!

This recipe was a huge hit at my house. I used one large glass casserole dish for it instead of a bunch of little pans. I did have to cook it almost 30 mins longer though. I also added 16 oz strawberry banana yogurt instead of sour cream. It turned out more cake like, but we loved it. The whole thing was gone in 3 days.

I made this banana bread this evening and made 1/2 the recipe.  It was the best banana bread I've ever had! I followed the recipe exactly and my 4 and 5yr old loved it! It did not disappoint.

Yum!! I omitted the nuts and cooked the loaf for 1 hr 5 minutes for the proper doneness. I only made one loaf so I changed the serving size to 8 and it came out perfect.

While I will try adding sour cream to my banana bread in the future, I won't be utilizing this recipe again. For me, there just was not enough banana flavor, instead there was a lot of sweetness from the amount of sugar. Additionally, the bread was more of a cake consistency rather than being dense like you would expect from a quick bread. I have my own recipe for banana that has never failed but decided to try this one to break out of my routine a little bit. Just wasn't for me...

This banana bread is fantastic! Not too sweet and very moist. My family loves it. I cut the recipe in half and made muffins; it was the perfect amount of batter for 12 muffins, filling the cups almost to the top. I baked them at 300 for 30 minutes but I think taking them out at 28 minutes would have been better as they were a little too brown. I changed it a bit since I don't always like to use butter in these kinds of breads. I replaced the butter with applesauce and Stonyfield's low fat french vanilla yogurt in place of the sour cream. Even though I used french vanilla yogurt I still added vanilla. I added about 1/2 tsp nutmeg too. I didn't dust the cups with sugar and cinnamon, I just didn't think it was necessary and I'm glad I didn't. I think it would have been too sweet. I used 3 bananas but I think adding another would be even better.

My whole family LOVED this! It took longer to cook than the instructions tell you. For me, I had to bake it an extra hour! But, other than that, everything was PERFECT! With this recipe, I was able to bake in two 5x9x2 glass pans and three of the small tin foil pans (I think they were 4x2).

*** Originally reviewed 2/17/14 ***
This has become my "go to" recipe for the perfect banana nut bread!  I have made it for holidays, to welcome new neighbors and for the kids to devour. It's easy and crazy, yummy.  I like to add frozen cranberries to it; because I love that bite of tang when I eat the finished bread. It's so delicious.

*** Updated 12/30/18 ***
Still wonderful.  Still delicious! My kids love it, their friends love it, their teachers love it, my colleagues love it. 

The only thing I've changed is, I use a whole, fresh bag of washed & dried cranberries (picking out mushy or white ones); I put in half of the cranberries whole & the other half chopped. Also add 1 1/2 cups of chopped walnuts. Sometimes I add a generous dash of nutmeg & same with cloves.

I've used this recipe 3 or 4 times now and have found no problems,  although I did increase the temperature to 325F for one hour and they come out perfect.  For a healthier version I use plain yogurt in place of the sour cream.  I've also used the brown sugar, pecan, butter and flour mixture on top, suggested by another patron, and it's amazing. This is our recipe for life!

I would rate this 7-10.... It was very heavy.  It was def very moist, I just wish I had used maybe one more banana and used bigger pieces of walnuts instead of chopped walnuts.

I prepared this recipe only to have cream cheese for stead of sour cream. On top of that, about 3 5min into cooking phase, the butter got left in the microwave so, there was no butter or fat content in the mix as well, i added a 4th egg because mine were very small.

I could not stand the melted butter just to get put back into the fridge so, i rued a 1/4 cup of cocoa, about 5 oz of strawberry preserves and a half cup sugar for a topping. I included the rest of the cream cheese left over which was about 3 oz. I set in sauce pan on med heat long enough to DE-crystalise the sugar and melt down the cream cheese. I topped both now cakes once they were cooled enough and it was actually very good and no ingredients were wasted. i never made a banana bread without some fat content be it oil or butter and i have to tell you that the sponginess and moistness was quite impressive despite my mistake of not adding the butter. 

My apologies if in any way i took away from the original author's recipe by sharing my mistake. Cheers!

I eliminated the sugar dusting and divided the batter between four 8x4 aluminum foil pans. Baked them all together on a large cookie sheet for 1 3/4 hours at 300 degrees adding a loose foil cover the last 45 min. Turned out perfect.

I tried this recipe once and loved it!  My only change was the amount of butter.  It asks for WAY to much.  Cut it down by a third and you'll be fine... enjoy :-)

I substituted plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream. It was the first time I had made banana bread  so the prep time was more like 20 minutes for me but the loaves came out moist and delicious.

I make this all the time and we love it. I cook it in mini loaf pans, regular, and even in a bundt pan (all at the same time). You are going to have to cook it longer if you use something other than mini loaf pans. Just take out the loaf when the toothpick comes out clean.  I do make one change to the original recipe; I substitute plain yogurt for sour cream.

Followed this recipe to the letter and by far, hands down, the BEST banana bread EVER!  The bread was done in exactly one hour at 300 degrees.  Made not one change to the recipe.  Absolutely perfect!  This is definitely a keeper!!!!

So, this was my first time ever making any kind of bread, and it came out perfectly! Huge shout-out to SaraLady19. I used her suggestions on the adjusted baking time and added that dash of nutmeg. I also halved the recipe, used 2 eggs, and omitted the milk. (Okay, I forgot the milk.) Everybody in this house rolled their eyes when they ate it.

Perfect made just as written except I didn't have 4 loaf pans so I used 2 loaf pans and 1 bundt pan and I froze the 2 loafs... Excellent!!! And I had every ingredient on hand which is always a plus. Great recipe!

A delicious banana bread recipe. Very sweet though. Just know that before you make it. Personally, I will decrease the sugar a little bit next time. It also makes a lot! I ended up making 6 muffins, 9 mini loaves, and one regular 9 x 5 loaf.

This is the best banana bread I've ever eaten!  I didn't change any of the ingredients.  Co-workers enjoyed it and asked for the recipe.  My husband loved it and he said it was the moistest banana bread he's ever had.  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!  It will be one that I use from here on...

3 stars because the finished product was good. First, I hope you have a rain barrel to mix it in because it makes about 15 gallons of batter.  I made two 3x7 loaves and a bundt cake.  It also took exactly 1 hour 5 minutes to cook at 350 degrees.  I didn't even try to cook it at 300.  3 tsp is a tablespoon.  I don't think the sugar-cinnamon step added anything at all.  But the loaf is good which is good because it made a lot.

I love this banana bread. However it has to much sugar so I cut the sugar down to 2 cups and if I add chocolate chips I only use a cup and a half.

I made the recipe AS IS and it was perfection. I chopped the walnuts until they were very fine and that seemed to work best (less chunky).  We ate ours with cinnamon butter and it was fantastic. This is my new 'go to' recipe. Holy YUM!

Delicious!! I ended up having to cook them longer (about an hour and a half total) but it was worth it!!  I used Regular Splenda & brown sugar Splenda 50/50). low fat butter and low fat sour cream to cut down on the calories and it was still amazing!

This may be the yummiest banana bread I've ever made! I cut the sugar to 2 cups and still received accolades from my family. Don't know that I'd bother with the cinnamon sugar in the future ... it didn't seem to add much taste.

just ok. I baked it on a big and little pan. It was on the dry side, maybe cooked it too long, by 15mins. The taste was more on the sweet side. But the Sugar/Cinnamon gave it a nice crunch on the outsides

Loved it!  I will definitely be using this recipe again.  I recently moved half way across the country and discovered that I no longer had my loaf pans.  I had made the full recipe, so I put it in a 16x12 pan.  I baked it at the 300 degrees for an hour and it came out perfect!  It was so wonderfully moist and delicious!

Moist, rich and Amazing loooove it. I made some alterations to it:
1- 2 tablespoons baking powder instead of 3 teaspoons baking soda
2- 1 whole stick of butter.
3- put it in cupcake pan and into the 350 F oven for 1/2.

Like most of the reviewers, I had to bake this for much much longer — almost 2 hours! It is good, but too sweet even using bananas that weren't super ripe. Next time I will cut the sugar content by at least 1 cup and try again.

***Update*** I still make mine this way, the only change I make is to dust the top with cinnamon/sugar mix on top before baking - otherwise I do everything the same. I just watch the baking time because every stove bakes differently. Mine usually takes about an hour. 

PERFECT THE WAY IT IS!! I'm not known for my skills in the kitchen because I do kind of lack pretty much all cooking skills. I do like to bake and have made this recipe several times exactly as shown and now everyone says I make the best banana bread they have ever tasted and often ask for my secret. I just tell them sour cream. lol!!! Thank you so much for the recipe!

This is a great recipe! I couldn't find Mom's original recipe. (and over ripe bananas were calling!) I wasn't sure very sure at first when I saw this recipe, (After reading the lower reviews) but you never know unless you try making it yourself! 

The banana bread needed a few more minutes more than an hour, but after it turned out wonderful! There weren't any purple banana globs and the whole bread was evenly cooked. I also made some cream cheese frosting to go with it. Together with frosting and more mild sweetness of the banana bread this recipe was wonderful! 

This was my first time making banana bread without Mom directly helping. If your new to making banana bread like me, this is a great recipe! I will without a doubt use this recipe again. Actually, I plan on making more banana bread very soon! (more bananas calling!)

I have made lots of banana bread and this is by far the best recipe I have made. I followed the recipe exactly (no nuts).  It is so moist and dusting the pan with cinnamon sugar before baking gives it that little extra "something"

Fabulous recipes! These muffins are amazingly moist and full of flavour! I changed the following things: 1/2 c melted coconut oil, 2 c applesauce, and 1 c sour cream, I used 6 packages (1.5 tsp) stevia, 1 c sugar and 1 c coconut sugar.

My mom's "Betty Crocker" banana bread we had during the holidays every year was so good... This is even better! I make several batches with a twist and like most holiday breads, it's better after freezing. I like to add a cup of pumpkin or a cup of chocolate chips.

I modified my flours by using 2 cups oat flour 2 cups regular flour and 1/2 cup ground flaxseed meal. I also found that when using  a regular size loaf pan , the middle was not done , but upon using the mini loaf pans temperature was ok , with an Electric oven , but I used the pampered chef mini loaf stoneware . If you only have the larger loaf pans I would start temp at 325 and check loaves after 45 min of bake time . This is a great recipe though !

It was very low on banana flavor and I used extremely ripe bananas to prepare it. I should have expected this with so few bananas spread out between four loaves of bread. I also don't believe that the sour cream adds anything to the recipe.

Best banana recipe I ever made! Only thing was, it took forever and a day to bake at 300. My mum recommended amping it up to 350 next time so I might do that. Very moist, great recipe!

Clearly a winner. I only had 3 bananas so cut everything in half & made one big loaf - which stayed a bit too moist in the middle, but - my choice so my bad.  Even the non-banana-eating kids LOVED this!

Made this with nonfat sour cream and everything else pretty much as written (though I did not dust the pans with cinnamon and sugar) and made muffins. I baked them at 325 until they were light brown and passed the toothpick test. They were delicious and moist and so much better than just regular banana bread! Great texture, great flavor, a definite keeper! They made about 36 regular-sized muffins--great for freezing and eating for snacks!

Kudo's for such a wonderful recipe that will be my go to for years! Thank you!!!

I made this twice now the second time I used nonfat plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream! Absolutely perfect every time! I only bake two loaves at a time and they always come out perfect after 60min @300 with my metal loaf pans!

This is BY FAR the best banana bread recipe I've ever tried. I gave a few mini-loaves to the people at my dentist's office, and they raved about it. Even my husband, who is not a huge banana bread fan, loved it.

Super moist, sweet without being overbearing, and the banana flavor is very strong. This has become my go-to recipe for banana bread. Well done!

Mine did not work at all. It turned out gluey and rubbery. I learned the important thing is probably not to overbeat it. I used an electronic mixer and made it too smooth. May try it again.

My kids and I had fun making this one together.  The results were super moist. We doubled the recipe to have some on hand in the freezer.  We made the crumb topping from the banana crumb muffins from this site to make it truly decadent :)  Needless to say, we have gone through 2 loaves in about a week.  Loved it!

This is an 11 out of 10.  Every time I make this, it is a big hit.  Thank you so much for the best banana bread recipe ever.  I always add tons of chocolate chips and walnuts. Yum yum.

This is a great banana bread recipe that lended itself easily  healthy substitutions. I halved the recipe and substituted:
1. 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and 2 tbsp butter instead of all butter
2. 8 ounces Chobani Greek yogurt instead of sour cream
And I opted not to sprinkle additional sugar... It has plenty already. I baked four 7x3" loaves on 300f for one hour.

I halved the recipe and used 1 egg and 1 cup sugar (thought 11/2 cups would make it too sweet) I only had a 9x5 loaf pan and baked it at 325 for one hour. Turned out really good. And don't skip on dusting the pans with the cinnamon sugar mixture, its a nice touch to the bread

OH MY GOODNESS!!! This is the BEST recipe I have ever tasted! I made the recipe exactly as directed and had no problems at all with the outcome being anything other than YUMMY MOIST BANANA BREAD! I didn't want FOUR loaves so I made 2 loaves, 1 9" round cake, & 12 muffins ... all with this one recipe! Love it, thank you for sharing this recipe.

Love this recipe! I made it as part of a mother's day brunch. I cut the recipe in half and used the full amount of batter in a round bundt cake pan. Cooked for about an hour. This was sooo moist and wonderful and was a huge hit! Everyone loved it, and my sister described it as "the best banana nut bread EVER". Will definity use this again!

FANTASTIC!  This is the best banana bread ever!  I decided to use some old bananas and happen to have 6.  The only change I made was use chocolate chips instead of nuts.  I also put my oven on 325 and had to cook it longer than the hour indicated.  This recipe is def. a keeper.  Thank you for posting it!

Maybe the best banana bread recipe I have ever tried.  I halved the recipe, and used regular loaf pans.  I had to bake them almost 80 minutes, but they turned out great.  I also added chocolate chips, yummy!  This will be my go to banana bread recipe from now on!

By far the best banana bread recipe I have ever made.  I made very little changes to the recipe.  I used baker's sugar (super fine sugar) instead of regular granulated.  I only had 5 bananas so I did add a tsp of banana flavoring just in case.  A dash of pumpkin pie spice as well.  I made one large loaf, 5 jumbo muffins and 4 mini loaves with the amount of batter.  Everyone loved the sugar and cinnamon crunch on the bottom.  Only thing to note is the bake time is definitely longer than an hour.  It took about 90 minutes for my large loaf and about 45 for my mini loaves and muffins.  But just keep testing and you won't be disappointed!

I looked at the top of my microwave... 6 bananas then I looked in my fridge, 2 tubs of sour cream. I had to use this stuff up, pronto! So, with a bit of searching, I found this recipe. I'll admit, I was thinking "300? That's odd; I usually bake these at 350", but I went ahead. I followed the recipe exactly and popped it in the over for 300. The aroma filled my house quickly and it smelled SO good! After an hour, I opened my oven to find..... a big wet mess. I left it for an additional 15 minutes. Again, a big wet mess. So! I cranked the oven to 350 and covered the breads with aluminum foil to try to minimize burning the tops. Worked great! After 15-25 mins amazing, moist banana bread! But - the texture does remind me more of a cake than a bread and it is very sweet!

I love this recipe. It's the best banana bread I have ever eaten. Not sure why people have trouble with it cooking in the center (either too much sour cream or too much batter in the pan). I follow the directions to a "T" and it has turned out every time. EVERYONE loves it!

Have made this twice now and it turns out GREAT!  Though it makes a TON of batter, seriously, whoa.  I left the walnuts out intentionally the first time and accidentally the second time but even so, super moist with great flavor.  FYI it will need to bake longer than an hour depending on the pan, so plan accordingly.  Last night a loaf pan took 1hr15 and a bundt pan took 1hr20.  This one's a winner!

Wow! I usually hate banana bread, but I LOVE this recipe!  I follow SaraLady19's suggestions with the temp at 325 for 1 hr, 10 mins, and the Zucchini Bread IV crumble recipe.  This results in the most delicious banana bread I could imagine.  I've made this for my friends and neighbours, and they're always asking me for more!  I'm only too happy to oblige because this recipe usually makes 2 big loaves and two mini loaves.  Thanks so much for sharing!!!

Delicious. My husband said it was the best banana bread he has ever had and I have made multiple recipes. I only added 1c sugar (halved the recipe) cooked for 40 min, covered with foil and then 20 min more at 300, it came out perfect. Made these again, the whole batch made 10 mini loafs. They cooked for 50 min on 300

I used the other recommendations and baked at 325 for 1 hr 10 min and they came out just right. I also used pecans instead for the nuts and used 1 cup for half the recipe, perfect! Will use this recipe over and over!

I've made this recipe at least 50 times in the past few years.  Today I decided to make it as muffins rather than loaves.  I can't imagine a more tender muffin that these.  The only item I altered in the recipe was to use 1/2 brown sugar AND 1/2 white sugar rather than all white.  Perhaps this had the positive impact on the texture.  Would be great with old-fashioned cream cheese frosting (just a dollop on top)for a dessert too.  I used a large cookie scoop for the muffins and a standard cupcake pan; the recipe yielded 54 perfect muffins.  You won't be disappointed with this recipe.  Everyone I've ever made it for has absolutely adored it!

Made these into cupcakes and they were delicious!! I swapped the sour cream for greek yogurt and I sprinkled the cinnamon and sugar mixture on top of the cupcakes before baking. Everyone loved them! This is the perfect recipe for overripe bananas. The mix does make alot, I mad 24 cupcakes and 2 small loaf pans. So yummy and moist!!

No better banana bread. I make two 4x8 loafs though. You just have to adjust the cooking time and use a toothpick to check and make sure it's done. I could sell this bread at a coffee house for $3.00 a slice. WOW!

Wonderful recipe! I didn't have the loaf pans so I put it in a 9x13 Pyrex dish and it worked out well. I will make this again!

I made the batter following the recipe exactly. I used three 9x5 loaf pans and baked at 325 for 70 minutes. The loaves came out moist and delish. I was concerned the bread would be too dark as it was already a deep tan color 60 minutes into the baking time and the middle hadn't set yet. I needn't worry though; the last ten minutes of bake time set the middle but didn't overtake the crust. Tasty recipe!

Very tasty! I'm really not a very good cook, but I followed the recipe per directions, just added less banana-I didn't want the overpowering banana flavor. It turned out very well, the cinnamon with less bananas makes more of a banana spice cake. I made into jumbo muffins, baked at 300 for about 32 minutes. I would add the crumb topping too as others have posted to give a nice/yummy look. Great recipe.

this is my all time favorite banana bread recipe.  i made just a few minor changes.  i bake it at 350 and instead of four pans, i use three.  i also mix brown sugar, chopped nuts and cinnamon and sprinkle it on top of the loaves (i could swear this used to be part of the instructions of this recipe).  my oven is old, so it takes a bit longer than an hour.  i just keep an eye on it and use the good old toothpick test.

This is a wonderful recipe.  It made much more than I expected however, but since it's Christmas, I have extras for gifts. I filled up my Pampered Chef stoneware for baking 4 mini breads, then I used four more individual mini bread pans. Since my oven usually bakes things a bit quicker than recipes call for, I kept an eye on the bread while it was baking.  Still the bread was in the oven at 300 degrees for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, longer than the recipe calls for.  Using the toothpick method is the most reliable way to determine if the bread is done.  The bread was delicious and it made the house smell wonderful.

This recipe made enough batter for two 9x5 loaves plus six big muffins. I followed the suggestion to up the oven temp to 325 and that worked well. It was a little less dense than I expected but maybe that was because I only had 5 bananas on hand. The flavor is very good. Not sure I'm a huge fan of the cinnamon sugar coating but my son liked it.

The most moist banana bread ever! I made these in a pan that made 8 mini-loaves in each pan. I doubled the recipe and it made a lot...32 mini-loaves plus 2 loaf pans. I baked these at 325 and didn't have a problem with them being under-done. Just preference, I cut the sugar to 2 cups per batch and I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the batter. I sprinkled vanilla bean sugar, that I got from a spice store, on the top of the loaves before baking along with some pecans. Delicious! Honestly, it was amazing and very pretty. Personally, I would add even less sugar next time. Could be because of the cinnamon sugar that I dusted the pans with and the vanilla bean sugar on top, but it was still too sweet for me. Overall, excellent recipe that's moist and full of flavor.

This recipe is wonderful! I use silicone loaf pans so I don't dust them with the cinnamon sugar, but I will sprinkle it on top if I remember. ;) I have made this several times and sometimes I substitute half of the sour cream for yogurt and it's just as good. This recipe freezes really well which I love because I bake in bunches. My kids love it and this is a quick breakfast with a glass of milk.

One minor change is I added 2 more bananas. Everything else followed the recipe to a T. Do not overmix the batter should be chunky. I also didn't have enough bread pans so I baked in 2 cake pans and it still came out moist and delicious.. I have a few favorite banana bread recipes over the years but this is the most simple and it comes out moist and delicious just like we love.

This is great! I substituted plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream, and the bread turned out great! Dusting the pan with the cinnamon sugar and dusting the top of the loaf before baking was wonderful.  It gives the top of the loaf a shiny, tasty finish and the yogurt/sour cream really does keep the bread moist.  Two thumbs up! Thanks for posting.

I made this into mini muffins.  Cooked them at 300 for 28 min and they came out great.  I added nutmeg to them and I only had 4 bananas but those were the only changes I made.  I think unless you are feeding a small army, this is a huge recipe.  I will cut it in half next time.  I got 96 mini muffins from it.  The kids, my husband and the guys at his work all loved them.  I don't even care for banana bread that much myself and I liked them.

We  all know to bake addy 350. 300 is for prime rib for 5 hours! I made exactly according to recipe. Great taste and consistency but time and temp are WAY off. I made two loaves and 12 large muffins. The muffins were done @ 1 hour. The loaves were almost raw. I turned the heat up to 350 and let them go for another 20 minutes to get them "done". Next time I think I'll start @ 350 and check them after 40 minutes.

My boss made this and it was the best ever.  I have been making banana bread for over 40 years and this is the best recipe I have ever tasted.  HOWEVER, when I tried to make it at home, I used very overripe (almost liquid) bananas and it did not work out at all.  The second time I used bananas with lots of brown spots and it was delish!!  If bananas start turning from brown to black, I would not recommend using them.

This was a wonderful recipe and I love it and will continue to use this one! I made two large loaves rather than four small ones. This recipe for me was not done in an hour. After one hour...I put on my timer for 30 more minutes at 325 degrees and they were perfect! (I was sad to see where someone who rated this recipe a one star threw out all four of theirs because it wasn't done). The key is to know your oven and to adjust accordingly...DEfinitely use a toothpick and test after an hour...then add maybe 15 minutes at a time until the toothpick comes out clean! My house smells delicious as it is cooling!

My mother in-law pushed a bundle and a half of very ripe bananas on me; looking for me to whip together a nice fall treat. After using this recipe I can't wait for my next surprise banana bundle. I did add an extra banana since I had so many. Also, I added ginger to my dry ingredients as well as to the pan before pouring in and baking.

I made one loaf of this bread, so I cut the serving size from 32 to 8. It confused me at the beginning because the directions didn't change, only the ingredients, but after a minute I realized my stupidity. I threw in 2 banana's instead of 1.5 and used a whole egg instead of 3/4 of an egg (because how am I supposed to measure that, lol). It came out well, I had to bake it for an extra 10 minutes. The bread was extremely moist, but not undercooked. In the future I think I'll use the correct amount of bananas.

There's something very odd about this recipe:  when I first tasted it straight out of the oven, I didn't really think it was any more fabulous than any other banana bread recipe I've tried in the past, but I had a tough time refraining from eating the entire loaf then and there!  I made exactly as written, except I don't have any 7x3 pans.  I made the bread in one 9x13 pan and one 9x5 pan, and filled them up even with each other.  The 9x5 cooked in about an hour, and the 9x13 cooked in about 1 hour 5 minutes.  I think that the bread really does need the crumb topping that so many other reviewers were suggesting; it was delicious and moist, but lacking that "wow" factor.

I have made this bread 4 times and it always turns out delicious! I have also tried it with blueberries and ran out of white sugar, so used half brown sugar, both variations were great. I bake it at a slightly higher temperature (320 degrees) for an hour and fifteen minutes, as is suggested in other reviews. One time I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and this turned out well, too.

Like everyone here; the best banana bread recipe ever. I normally hate making a new recipe because they always ask for some things I don't have handy. Just so happen I have all the ingredients it calls for. 
I am a rebel in my own right. I almost never follow a recipe. so, here are little things I did.
I only had three babanas at home. I made half the recipe and used a regular loaf pan instead of small loaf pans. Put sour cream more and cut the butter in half. Use half the sugar and substitute the other half with brown sweetener. Baked for 1 hour and 35 mins in the oven. 
The bread was so good. The kids ate almost entire loaf at one sitting. I will be making it again for sure.

I've tried a lot of Banana bread recipes, even one with sour cream in it, but this was definitely the best.  Kids and Husband thought so too.  I halved the recipe but wish I didn't, so we would have more to eat!  I would measure out the mashed bananas rather than go with a certain number.  I used 1.5 cups for half the recipe so 3 cups for the full recipe amount as said by another reviewer would be fine.

Wonderful banana bread. I halved this recipe but now I'm wishing I would have made all 4 loaves. Very moist. Made it exactly how it was suggested.

Because I only had half the sour cream, I added 3 (100g) vanilla fat free yogurts; and, since I only had two bananas, I added 1 cup applesauce along with the 2 bananas.  I could have eaten it all in one sitting it was so delicious.  However, I did find my tins small and would put the batter into 5 small loaf tins instead of 4.

First time, soo good! Of course i changed it like everybody. My bananas were frozen last week before they went bad and i substituted 1 cup of brown sugar for a cup of the white. Best ever, you can't go wrong with this one.

This is the best banana bread I have ever made. And I don't even like banana bread that much. Everyone I've ever given it to asks for the recipe and promptly makes it themselves. It's that good :)

This was wonderful! 
I made the full amount, which made two loafs and 12 large muffins. 
Changes: Only 2 cups of sugar, added a dash of nutmeg, and mixed half low fat sour cream and half plain yogurt. 

I also made another batch with MANGOES!!! (more muffin like, less sweet) 
Changes: Three large mangoes mashed, 2 cups sugar only, and slightly less sour cream

LOVED this recipe! I did change a couple of things to make it a bit healthier. I used 1 egg and 2 egg whites rather than 3 whole eggs. I used 2 cups of unsweetened apple sauce instead of the 3 c of sugar and I used fat free greek yogurt rather than sour cream as the local grocery store did not have fat free sour cream. I also did not use any butter. They taste amazing and moist! I did use the sugar and cinnamon to dust the pans and added 1/2 c of chocolate chips :) 
Will definitely make them again!
Mine yielded 3 large loaves and they took 1 hr and 20 mins to bake. 
Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe!

Awesome! I discovered I only had 4 bananas mid mix, so quickly added some banana cream pudding. I made the whole recipe, 2 loafs & 11 large muffins. I used Walnuts & added the crumb topping another review suggested. ~ 1/2 cup packed brown sugar ~ 1/2 cup all-purpose flour ~ 2 or 3 tablespoons butter or margarine ~ 1 teaspoon cinnamon ~ 1/3 cup chopped walnuts. I baked 350 for about 35 minutes for muffins annd 55 for the loafs. Yummy!

This was a fantastic recipe! It was devoured by my husband and kids. I followed the exact recipe minus the walnuts and added a crumbled topping of butter, sugar and flour which blended in and made it fluffy and delicious! I also baked some in cupcake pans and turned out fantastic! This recipe is a keeper.

I made a few changes to this recipe that seemed to work well.  I used 3/4 cup of no sugar added peach flavored applesauce (it doesn't affect the flavor) instead of butter.  I had 4 egg whites, so I used those in place of the eggs.  I cut down to 2 cups of sugar and I think it was plenty sweet.   Lastly, I didn't make the topping or dust the pans with sugar.  I ended up having to bake for about 20 minutes longer because of the changes, but it turned out nicely and you'd never know it was lower in fat.

Amazing! I always find a new banana bread recipe because I am never that satisfied.  I have finally found one I love!  It does make a ton! I made 1 9x5 loaf pan, 24 muffins, and a tray of mini muffins.  It would easily make 3 loaves in a 9x5 tray.  I could see halving the recipe, but it was so delicious that they had no problem disappearing.  I took about 1/3 the batter and added 1/4 cup cocoa powder and some chocolate chips.  Those were amazing as well.

I butchered this banana bread and it is still great. I was preoccupied and watching a movie when I decided to whip up something sweet. I halved the recipe and did not pay attention so I wound up only using 3 tablespoons of sugar (half of the amount used for dusting the pan DUH).

The bread is still very moist and good. I can only imagine how great it would be if I had done it right.

My bf and I are eating the "butchered" banana bread right now and it is still pretty good! Since it is not very sweet I think it will be good for breakfast with peanut butter.

This had very good taste.  You really can't taste the sour cream.  I made some changes that I often make to recipes without them making any difference to taste in my opinion.  I use 1/2 King Arthur white whole wheat four and half all purpose, 1/2 Splenda 1/2 sugar and I through in about 2 Tbs of ground flax seed.  I also had to half the recipe, I only had 4 bananas.  Technically half the recipe calls for 3 but I used all 4.  I really liked this bread.  It came out lighter/less dense than my traditional recipe and also less moist, which I was looking for.  Obviously the changes I made may have altered the outcome but in my other banana bread recipe they don't. I was looking for a recipe to try that might give me a lighter  result and I think this did.  I also thought this bread was less bitter than my normal recipe.  I usually don't care for banana bread because I find it a little bitter.  I use baking soda without aluminum so that is not the reason for the bitter taste I usually get.  I would make this again and I recommend it.  The only reason I give 4 stars is I think most people like banana bread more moist than mine came out, but again it might be the changes I made.

I found my "go to" recipe for banana bread!  I cut the recipe in half and it worked well!  My 10 year old loved it and we polished off one loaf in my household in one night!  I added chocolate chips to my batch....delicious!

I loved this bread! I did use applesauce + 1TB oil in place of the butter, and I did not have the size pan suggested but used a 2 larger sizes, baked those for an hour and 10min, and the rest of the batter I put into muffin tins and baked for 20 min. Turned out moist with really good flavor! Will definitely keep this recipe!

Tried this recipe today with 2 cups of pumpkin instead of the bananas, 1/2 teaspoon cloves and nutmeg each. It was pretty good, used a large pan and turned the heat to about 320 (oven read 325 and had to turn it up to 330 after an hour but I believe my oven runs a tad cooler) Took a total of 1 hour 40 mins. I give it 4 stars since it wasn't the BEST Ive ever had. That said, a delicious way to use up the sour cream in the fridge :)

Excellent!  It makes a lot and the actual size of the bread pans in the recipe are a little odd so you have to make your adjustments.  minimum cook time 1 hour and keep checking every 10 minutes for a normal loaf pan.  You can't go wrong.

Best banana nut bread I have ever made. My family loves it. The bread freezes really well so you can make extra for christmas or for any other occasion. I'm so glad that I was able to go back to allrecipes.com to find this recipe because i misplaced my recipes and have lots of bananas that need to be transformed into yummy bread. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

I have made with recipe a few times now and love it.(I bake the loaves at 325 for 1h 20mins) but I have realized that it makes even better banana muffins! I just bake them at 325 degrees F for 30 mins and they are perfect everytime!

I have to agree with the other reviewer about the length and time of this recipe.  My bread was raw as well.  By time the toothpick can out clean, the bread was overcooked.  Ah, to bad for all that effort.

The only change I made was to make two larger loaves instead of 4. It takes about 30 min longer at 300 but they still cook just fine. Next time I'll try 1hr10min at 325 as was suggested in another review. I use light sour cream but not fat free and add chocolate chips sometimes.

This is a really good recipe.  One of the best I've had.  However, it stuck to all of my pans.  I had nonstick pans and I sprayed them with cooking spray.  I read where others used butter and theirs stuck too, so I guess it has something to do with the sugar cinnamon coating.  I think next time I will try it with out the coating.  It was sweet enough anyway.

I halved the recipe and had enough to make 1 bread and 12 muffins.  I did alter a bit in that I used half whole wheat flour and a little bran, and added chocolate chips.  They all turned out great!  The loaf browned lovely.  Very good and easy recipe! A definite keeper.

This banana bread is very sweet with very little banana flavor compared to the breads I usually make. The texture is alright. Just very mediocre IMO. I'm throwing them away because I can make much better things to eat and will save my calories for those that are worth it.

Lives up to the reviews- very moist and very good.  I didn't have any sour cream, so I used low fat vanilla yogurt instead and replaced half the butter with margarine.  I also added one more banana for extra moisture and left out the nuts.  It took a bit longer than an hour to cook all of the way through- probably an extra 15-20.  Thanks for the new banana bread recipe!

A wonderful recipe!  The oven temperature needs to be 325 degrees.  For a healthier alternative, I used a quarter cup of applesauce as a substitute to a quarter cup of better.  My wife did not notice until I told her.  I added a light coating of chopped walnuts to the top of the batter before it went into the oven.  It provides a crunchy topping which I enjoy.  This recipe is a keeper.

Great bread.  I made two loaves in 9x5 1/2 loaf pans and 16 muffins @ 325. Muffins for 30 min loafs for 1 hr. Used 1/2 fat free sour cream and 1/2 plain yogart.  I only wish the sugar content was lower.  I might try a motification next time.

This actually made three loaves for me which turned out PERFECT!!  I was even down a banana and didn't have any walnuts.  My husband couldn't stop eating it and two of our grown children, who have homes of their own, somehow sensed I was baking and made off with a loaf & 1/2.  By the end of the night we barely had half a loaf left.  This is definitely a keeper and will be used often, thank you!!!!  :oD

Amazing! I followed the recipe exactly, except baked the banana bread for 30 mins at 300 degrees and the  last half at 325 degrees. Don’t let the amount of sugar fool you as it does not taste overly sweet at all! Very moist, dense and flavorful! Brought to work and now coworkers asking me to make them a loaf! Thank you!!

Great recipe!  I have just made 1/2 of the recipe , 1/2 brown sugar + 1/2 white sugar, and 2 eggs. The 1/2 of the recipe was just right for a 9 x 5 inch loaf pan.  It took about 1 hour and 15 minutes (with 325 degrees F )to bake.   Next time, I would like to try less than one cup of sugar.

I am not usually a fan of banana bread nor do I usually comment on sites after using a recipe. HOWEVER, one day I had a bunch of overripe bananas and figured it would be a good idea to make some banana bread with it. First off, I cannot make bread to save my life! I followed this recipe exactly at first and it came out so moist and delicious. Everybody loved it! Now, this is a part of my normal rotations everytime i have alot of overripe bananas. Thanks for this!

I just made this and it turned out pretty awful! I baked it for an hour, but it didn't look close to finished. Baked it for another 30 minutes and the toothpick came out clean. I let it cool and when I came back, the bread had fallen in the middle. I cut into it and inside seemed really heavy and didn't seem cooked all the way. I should have stuck with the recipe I've always used before, but wanted to try something different. The outside that actually crusted was good. I feel like I wasted good money and time on this recipe. Like another review said, I knew something was off with the degree it was to baked. 300 degrees doesn't seem right.

Much too sweet in my personal opinion (even as a sweets nibbler) but a moist cake nonetheless. I would cut the sugar in half and leave all else as is :) overripe bananas deliver plenty of sweetness!

This is now the only banana bread I make now.  I make half the recipe for 2 loaves, took the advice of another reviewer who suggested cooking at 325 for 70 minutes.  Only thing I added was some chopped pecans & about 1/2 cup or so of mini-chocolate chips.  A co-worker is always asking when I am going to make it next bcause he just loved it!  I especially like dusting the pans with the cinnamon sugar.  Nice touch.

Made this exactly as is, but used 2/3 splenda and 1/3 sugar.  It was moist and tasty - I gave it 4 stars because it would be even better with a crumb topping (and chocolate chips!)

WONDERFUL!!! I made two loaves and they were gone so fast I wish I would have made the full batch.  I did not add the walnuts to the bread instead I combined about 1 1/2 cups of them with butter, sugar, and cinnamon and used it for a topping on the loaves, YUM!!

One of the best banana breads I've tried in a while. Followed recipe to a "T" and hand mixed everything to combine well.  I used 6 medium size very ripe bananas, mashed up well along with a (16 oz) reduced fat daisy sour cream. Added in some rough chopped walnuts. I don't have any 7x3 inch loaf pans.  I filled up three 9x5 loaf pans (greased) a little more than halfway. I sprinkled a little more cinnamon/sugar on top of the bread right before putting it into the oven. I baked them at 325 degrees for 1hr 20 mins until done. The breads baked up nicely, rising just over the edge of the pan. The top of the bread was nice and brown. The bread is very moist, not dry, soft and flavorful. I think it has to be the sour cream that helps to make it moist on the inside. I could definitely taste and smell the bananas as well as the cinnamon/sugar. The walnuts adds a nice texture to the bread. I love the hint of cinnamon/sugar, nothing was overly sweet, just right for me. The wonderful cinnamon/sugar aroma just filled my house.  Adding the brown sugar crumb topping (from another reviewer) really sounds good. I think I might try that the next time I make this bread. But on its' own, this banana bread is moist and delicious! I am very happy with the way this turned out. thank you esther nelson for sharing this wonderful banana sour cream bread recipe!

Very good recipe!  I like to reduce the sugar by 1 full cup in the batter and add a 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ground cloves.  Then make a rum glaze (with Goesling Rum) and brush that on, OMG - that makes it a 5 star!

This would have been a good recipe, but it didn't cook in the very center. I used one more banana than the recipe called for, so that *might* have contributed to this; I'm not really sure, as I'm a complete novice at baking. But I still wouldn't use this recipe again...

Not a super banana flavor but a good texture and moistness!
I ended up cutting the recipe in half (used 2 eggs), doing half brown/half white sugar and subbed 1/4c apple sauce for butter (the 2T extra I used melted butter) oh and a hint of nutmeg because I like it. They turned out light fluffy and very moist. 
Knowing my oven, I preheated to 325 and got 16 jumbo muffins after cooking 20 minutes. Perfection!

The best banana bread I have had in a long time! I had way too many bananas and was weary of making MORE banana bread, but this recipe was definitly worth doing. So moist and delicious! I even stuck a loaf in the freezer for a couple months, and brought it too my mothers house for a family gathering....it was a huge hit, still tasted like fresh! Thank you Esther, this is the only banana bread recipe I will ever use from now on!

This is fantastic! I cut the recipe in half, using two eggs, (I did not have enough bananas) and made mini muffins instead of loaves. Half of this recipe made almost 72 muffins! I did not use the extra cinnamon and sugar to coat the pan. The muffins were sweet enough without it. My 1 year old and 5 year old keep coming back asking for more. This is a definite keeper.

This is by far the best banana bread recipe EVER.  Also if you don't have walnuts and you do happen to have some chocolate chips add them instead, it makes for a great treat!!

1. 5 stars with my changes. I didn't coat the pan with cinnamon and sugar. I sifted the flour and soda and stirred it better. I didn't add cinnamon, salt or vanilla to the batter. I baked it at 325 for 1 hour and it was perfect!
2. Half recipe also came out great!
3. Made a 1/2 recipe, using plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and egg whites. Still THE BEST recipe for banana bread!

I decided to make this recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand to make a half batch and my bananas needed to be used. Made this two days ago and both loaves are gone, such a tragedy, it was super tasty and moist. Didn't rise very high but the flavor was on point with a dash of clove and nutmeg!

I made this today, the only things I changed were instead of using butter I used Wesson oil (all I had), and I didn't have walnuts so I added a little bit of chocolate chips.  This by far was the best banana bread I have tasted!  I absolutely love the pan dusted with cinammon and sugar because it makes the crust sweet and crispy!  Very easy to make.

Really good.  I halved the recipe & made the healthy substitutions LINDABTX listed in her review.  What I differently from her was to use half honey for the sugar.  I kept the sour cream full fat (it's hard to find natural sour cream in a low fat variety,) but I think that was for the best anyway.  I used 1 egg and 1 egg white for the halved recipe.  FYI, I made mini-loaves and they took 40 min to bake at 325; the full size loaf took an hour.

Amazing! My husband cannot eat a lot of sugar, so I substituted the sugar with splenda. I tried it once with fat free sour cream and once with full fat sour cream- full fat makes all the difference! So worth the extra calories. The texture is divine, the kids adore it, and it is the best banana bread I have ever had!

Loved it. The kids loved it too. I used strawberry/banana yogurt and some whey I needed to get used in place of the sour cream, also added a few diced strawberries in with the bananas and used 100% whole wheat flour but this recipe still worked great with all the changes and adaptations. I am glad it makes 4 loaves so I can freeze a couple for later. Am going to make cinnamine toast with the left over cinnamon sugar mixture on the bread in the morning! Thanks so much for sharing!!

Delicious and moist! The outer crust is crunchy and sweet, but not overbearingly so. Great with walnuts. This is my new favorite banana bread recipe.

I made this for Christmas morning to accompany strata and was pleasantly surprised.  Though more like a spice bread than banana bread, it's cake-like consistence was perfect as is.

I made this in a medium loaf pan and the rest in muffins.  It tasted good, but the baking temp/time was way off for me.  I think I'll stick with my Martha Stewart recipe for banana bread.

Not sure what it was but this reminded me of when people use banana extract to make banana bread.  Was it the sour cream?  Regardless, our favorite remains Banana Crumb Muffins (from the site that I make into a loaf).  It's not a bad recipe, just not our favorite.  This batter barely fit into my KitchenAid.  It was up to the top.  Nice that it makes 4 loaves but I wouldn't bother attempting again since we have our favorite on here.

I had problems with getting these loaves done.  I only have two 2 bread, so I filled a muffin pan and cooked that for 30 minutes at 325 and the loaves for 1 hour and 10 minutes at 325.  The muffins were done but the center of the bread was undercooked so I sliced the ends off and put the center back in to cook for 15 more minutes.  The part that was done was very good but too much guess work in trying to get it to cook right.  Won't use this recipe again.

Perfect! Moist, fluffy, flavourful, perfect amount of sweetness, definitely a unique banana bread and the best I've ever tasted! I found the recipe, cooking time and temperature perfect. No adjustments needed!  Made it for a church brunch potluck and everyone raved about how good it was!

So delicious!  I decided to make this and use up some bananas that were sitting around on the kitchen counter.  I did a few things different than the original recipe: I heated the oven to 350 since I like a nice soft cake-like center and a slightly crispy, toasty brown outside, and this is usually the temperature I use to achieve that; also, I only have one loaf pan so I used a muffin tin, 1 9in round, and my lonely single loaf pan.  I didn't think about quantity until I saw how HUGE the bowl was when everything mixed together.  Glad I had a few different pans on hand!  I filled the muffin pan and put it in first, followed by the 9in round, then the loaf pan.  I left them in the oven for 15 min until the muffins were done and took those out, added another 15 for the round pan to finish cooking and pulled those, and finally another 20 for the loaf pan.  So easy and sooooo good!

Best banana bread ever!! The cinnamon flavor is prominent, while the banana flavor is more discreet.  It has a fluffy almost cake like consistency, which i loved.  Definitely a hit and something which will be a regular in my recipe rotation.  Thanks :)

EXCELLENT.  Make a day or two before. Taste better on 2nd day. Next time i do not think I would add the sugar and cinnamon on bottom of pan.  I made this in a loaf pan, mini muffins and reg.muffins.  worth making again

I halved the recipe and made these into 18 muffins. I used 6 T of butter, 1 c white sugar, 2 eggs, 3 bananas, 1 c sour cream, 1 t vanilla extract, 1 t ground cinnamon, 1/4 t salt, 1 1/2 t baking soda, and 2 1/4 cups flour. Instead of walnuts, I added chocolate chips. I baked them at 300F for 25 minutes. They were perfectly sumptuous!

This banana bread is DEE-LISH!!!  The moist texture makes this bread stand out from all the rest.  I did make a few changes after making it the first time.  First, the original recipe calls for TOO MUCH sugar.  I used 2 cups of ORGANIC RAW sugar.  And I skipped sprinkling the sugar on the pan before adding the batter.  It makes it tastes perfectly well balanced with the sweetness from the ripe bananas.  Also I added a small container of fresh raspberries.  PERFECTO!!!

I have baked this about 10 times and i dont ever change a thing! I am allergic to the nuts so i cant make them with the walnuts but if i could i would. I became allergic when i was 20 and man i sure do miss them. Dont forget to coat the pan the delicious sweet crust is whats keeping the recipe at 5 stars. I have had better B-bread but it lacked that crust!

Best banana bread I've ever had.  I halved the recipe, and following the suggestions of a few other reviewers I cut down on the sugar by a third (still PLENTY sweet) and used about half whole wheat flour instead of all white. I also added 1/2 t. nutmeg (1 t. for a full batch) which adds to an already INCREDIBLE flavor.  This recipe is definitely coming out again. I probably can't review it fairly because of the changes I made, so take that into consideration.

I loved this recipe! I love to cook , however I am not much of a baker, I followed the directions exactly except for the oven time my 4 loafs needed about 1 hr and 15 minutes and then they were perfect!! It is the best Banana Nut Bread I have ever tasted , so now my familiy buys bananas every time they go to the store hoping they sit around long enough to become ripe, in order for me to make more !!

So good! Instead of using a 16 oz container of Sour Cream, I used 1 cup of Sour Cream and 1 cup of Cream Cheese! SO WONDERFUL! I will make this again and again. The texture is perfect

First time banana bread baker. I was skeptical of the amount of mix & the baking temp and turned out to be correct about the time/temp. The amount of mix is matter of personal preference I guess.  The bread was not baked thru at one hour. I left it in much longer. Used 2 small & 1 large loaf pan (*neither* size was cooked thru at 1 hour at 300 degrees).   Might use more bananas for more banana flavor next time. Used 5 large bananas instead of six b/c  of their size, but probably could have used more.  With added baking time, it turned out moist & dense. Very cake-like. I'll experiment with another recipe before making this one again or follow modifications by other, more experienced bakers below.  Gave it 4 stars, b/c I'm inexperienced at Banana bread and want to give it the benefit of the doubt, but I suspect this won't wind up my favorite recipe.

This is one of the best Banana breads with sour cream.  I have made many in the past, and this is a winner.  It freezes well also.  Then you won't be tempted to eat in all in a day!

I used the sugar/cinnamon "topping" that goes on bottom that recipe had and it was WONDERFUL. I halfed the recipe and baked two loaves using a 7.5 x 4.5 glass bread pans @ 325 for 1 hour 10 min. I've tried MANY banana bread recipes and this is DEFINITELY top two.

Excellent recipes. I made most of the adjustments and additions recommended by SaraLady19 in her review. I added the topping (zucchini bread topping) that she recommended and it was delicious. This "bread" is much sweeter than my usual banana bread recipe, really more like a coffee cake. The sour cream does, indeed, make it much moister than most sweet breads. I made it for our school's "Boo Hoo" breakfast tomorrow and those parents are going to love it! Thanks for a great recipe!

This the BEST Banana Bread I've ever had!  Soft, fluffy, full of Banana flavor and not too sweet.  The only change I made was I omitted all of the cinnamon & didn't add nuts.  I also forgot to sprinkle sugar on the greased pans.  But it is absolutely amazing!  Thank you Esther for sharing this with us!!!

UPDATE:  I have made this Banana Bread TONS of times.  This makes A LOT of bread.  I usually make it in small disposable loaf pans but I have also made it in regular loaf pans.  I spray my pans but do not sprinkle sugar on the inside.  I also recently made it with bananas that were not super brown and ripe and it still came out just as wonderful.  This also freezes very very well which we have done numerous times.  WARNING if you do not add 6 bananas (I never mash mine, just add into my mix in chunks and my kitchen aid breaks them down no problem) you will not get as much banana flavor!

Love this recipe! I've used it without modification a couple times now, and the bread is soooo moist and delicious, not to banana-y. I've never been a huge banana bread fan but this recipe has turned me.  Also made a loaf with chocolate chips - what a nice treat :).

Great recipe, I did customize it a little, used plain non fat yogurt for the sour cream and apple sauce for the butter.  Light and tasty, it made a 9x13 pan, a 10 by 10 pan, and 6 jumbo muffins!  Won't use another recipe!

Rich, moist and a very special banana bread (and I don't even like bananas).   Certainly not for the calorie counters and, as was stated, it does need full fat sour cream.   If directions are followed you should not have a problem with it.

This is the first time I have ever baked anything! This recipe is perfect. I used only 2 cups of sugar instead of 3 and 4 cups of flour instead of 4.5. I also used one large deep dish and kept it in the oven for 1 hour 15 minutes at 300F.   P.S. Thanks for suggesting raisins! Works perfectly!

This was very good as most banana breads are.  Had that little tang of sour cream, though, which made it good.  Was best when first made.  Over time, the sour cream taste became stronger and took away from the really great flavor.

My husband and I made this late last night and it really turned out great, except, I didn't know at the time why it had a gel consistency, real moist, but not dry...I watched the video on banana bread making tips and this was the recipe they were making.  My husband and I had halfed the recipe to 16 servings using the conversion tool on this site.  I noticed in the video that the ladies did not use a full 16 oz container of sour cream and they were making a smaller batch as well.  The conversion tool halved everything else, except the sour cream.  We used a full 16oz sour cream and I think that may have been why our bread turned out with a gel consistency.  I think it probably should be 8 oz sour cream when cutting the recipe in half.

This is so good! We make it any time we have extra bananas. I follow the recipe exactly, but sprinkle some cinnamon and sugar on top of the mixture once it is in the pan to give it a nice crust.

I cut this recipe in 1/2 due to the lack of 6 bananas.  I also used 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 banana cream yogurt to kick up the banana flavor.  The dusting of the pans is a wonderful idea giving this bread a sugar-cinnamon crust.  I took this one step further in adding a layer of cinnamon-sugar to the top of the loaf as well.  This forms a thick sugar crust on the top.  The bread is moist and flavorful.  Oh, and I also subbed applesauce in stead of the butter - I almost always do this, and the bread always turns out great.  My husband says this is the best recipe so far.  Thanks!

This si so good! I am not a fan of banana bread - I made it at my son's request. But I will definitely be eating this. I did cook it at 325 as per some earlier comments and it still took almost 1 1/2 hours! My loaf pans were a little bigger than the size recommended so I tried to fit into 3 loaf pans - big mistake!!!

I got so many compliments on this bread! This is a great recipe. I ran out of white flour and used wheat (about 1 1/2c. wheat and 3 c. white) and I also ran out of white sugar (used 2 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown). I also greased the pans with butter and coated them with flax seeds and then put the batter in the pans, a trick I learned on allrecipes in another recipe, and did not put the extra sugar/cinnamon on top. This bread is excellent and is really moist because of the sour cream. Definitely a do-over!

FABULOUS!  I have been trying banana bread recipes that would measure up to my standards and finally found what I have been looking for!! This was really good!  I baked in two standard sized loaf pans and baked at 325 for about 1 hr and 15 min.  I also did the crumble topping another recommended and it really made the top great.  The bread was really sweet, though not a problem at our house.  Put the bananas in a ziplock bag and let the kids help mash them...this is their favorite part.  I did omit the nuts b/c my daughter is allergic but they are my favorite part of this bread.  Next time i will make one with nuts and one without. Thanks for sharing!

I, too, had to bake the loaves longer than the directions state but it was well worth it.  Yummy!!!

Mmmmmm, so yummy!  The top inch of the bread that rose above the pan was like a great big delicious chewy cookie.  Best banana bread recipe yet.

Absolutely the best banana bread recipe I have ever tried.  I made 4 big loaves for a family reunion and got compliment after compliment.  I wasn't sure about all the cinnamon but this made the bread.  I not only coated the pan with the sugar cinnamon mixture I also put some on the top which formed a sweet crust.  This is a keeper.

This was excellent! I used whole wheat flour, added a dash of nutmeg and cloves, and cut the sugar in half. If you don't like super sweet fruit breads, I would recommend reducing the sugar. I thought half the amount of sugar called for was plenty. Since I was only using half the recipe and only had one largish loaf pan, I increased the oven time to 325 for 65 minutes, which was perfect. Also, I covered the loaf with tinfoil the last 20 minutes of the cook time to avoid having the top get too brown.

Outrageously moist and great taste!   I made as described (w/o walnuts) and ended up with two regular sized loaves and 11 muffins.  The muffins took ~ 30 minutes to bake and the loaves took ~ 1 hr 10 mins before they were done.  Definitely a keeper!

This is the perfect banana bread recipe. I've used it several times and always get requests for it. The cinnamon sugar coating on the pans gives the loaves a nice touch.

I followed all the directions, except I did mash the bananas, and I used light sour cream.  In the last 15 minutes of cooking I did reduce my oven by 25 degrees, as the top was browining quickly in my oven.  I also sift my flour and melt the butter.

I made this recipe to take to work for a treat. It turned out perfectly. Wonderfully moist and banana-y. I did add extra spices, including nutmeg and ground clove. Everyone loved it and I was even asked for the recipe! Thank you

Love the light texture of this bread, and the cinnamon sugar is a nice touch.  I added a dash of nutmeg, and halved the recipe.  It made 1 8.5" loaf pan, and 16 mini-muffins for my toddler to have as snacks.

I made this recipe when my parents were visiting as I knew that at least 3 of us would eat it.  My kids and husband are anti-bananas!  I only had 3 very ripe bananas so added a small lunchbox size container  of applesauce.  This was wonderful.  My non-banana eaters loved it!  Very easy to make.

Absolutely the best banana nut bread recipe ever! Everybody that's tried it has the same thing to say...awesome! I bake mine in a bunt pan and one loaf pan rather than the 7 loafs. I bake at 300 until toothpick comes out clean. No need to change the recipe at all.

I halved the recipe and put it in 2 regular bread pans. Took about 45 minutes to cook. The breadis somewhat dry. Try another recipe. I can't change the stars... 3.5-4.

YUMMMMMMY! I had allrecipes adjust the servings to 16 - the only change I made to the recipe is 2 eggs (instead of 1 1/2 called for), 1 tsp of nutmeg and a handfull of milk chocolate chips (I didn't have any nuts). The batter made 16 generous muffins. They took 45 minutes @ 300 and came out golden brown, moist and delish!

Great recipe.  I followed the advice of other reviewers regarding cooking temp/time, and cooked 2 9x4 loaves for 75 minutes at 325.  I note that the author used very small pans (7x3) which could account for the discrepancy in cooking temp/time.  I added 1 Tbsp. spiced rum to the wet ingredients, and used a whole-grain baking mix instead of the flour, salt and baking soda. I added extra cinnamon, allspice and cloves to the dry ingredients.  My loaves came out moist and delicious!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Great flavor and bread is moist.  My only criticism is that it makes a HUGE amount of batter and it is hard to handle if you do not have a large mixer and mixing bowl.

This banana bread is incredible. I only had 3 bananas so I thought I would half the recipe. Everything went fine until I went to put the batter into pans. After I mixed it up I realized that I hadn't halved the flour and baking soda. I thought about throwing it all away but thought I would try to bake it and see what happened. It was incredible tasting. SO I can hardly wait to make it again but this time the right way. If it tastes half as good as my mistake it will be great. Thanks for this recipe. It is obviously a no fail banana bread.

This recipe was very good.  The bread was very moist.  I didn't have 4 loaf pans so I used a cupcake pan for the rest of the dough (cooked for 30 minutes).  They came out prefect.  I did have to cook the loaves a little longer than an hour.  I also added a little bit of chocolate chips and my whole family loved it!

Great recipe, very moist. I used an electric mixer and it was a little cake-like. Someone suggested that hand mixing creates a denser result. I will try that next time. Still five stars for excellent flavor, though!

YUM!!  I just let the bread cool a little bit and had a taste! YUM!! This bread is perfect.  Love the coating of cinn/sugar.  I didn't change a thing and I have to say this is one of the best banana breads I've had.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

One of the best banana bread recipes I've had.  My husband loved the cinimon/sugar on the outside of the bread... really added good flavor to dust the pans with it.   I have swapped this one in as my regular banana bread recipe from here on out.

Mmm, moist and tasty banana bread!  I halved the recipe and used 2 eggs and 4 bananas.  I didn't have sour cream, just subbed low-fat greek yogurt.  I love the sugar and cinnamon on the outside of the bread.  I would use this recipe again.

Amazing recipe! Loaf was gone in less than 5 minutes. Nice and moist. I used apple sauce in place of the butter and sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top before baking to give it a nice little crunch and a little more sweetness. Definitely putting this in my cook book!

OMG, I made these in my favorite 'crack muffin' pan and even my BF (who prefers zucchini bread) couldn't keep his hands out of my Mr. Frog cookie jar!  I made just a few changes to the recipe.  First I quartered the recipe (for a smaller more manageable batch), used plain yogurt instead of sour cream and added a little extra cinnamon and extra half a banana... it and uhm, uhm, uhm this banana bread is the absolute yummiest I've ever eaten!

Very good banana bread!  I am trying to lose my baby weight, so I made the following changes: halved the recipe, skipped the cinn/sugar sprinkling on the pan, used only 2 T. margarine and 1/4 c. applesauce.  Cut the sugar down to 1/2 c. sugar, 1/2 c. honey. Used only 1 egg, subbed fat-free plain yogurt for the sour cream (but that was just because that's what I had on hand), used almost all whole wheat flour (except for 1/4 c., which I used white).  Even with ALL these healthy changes, this yielded a sweet, hearty banana bread which the whole family loved!  I baked this in an 8x8 pan and just cut into squares.

Great recipe!  Super moist bread!  I use half brown sugar and white sugar.  That is the only change I made.  I did have to add almost 20 minutes of cooking time (maybe because of the size of my bread pans).  Love this recipe...have and will continue to use this recipe for my banana bread!

Love, love, love this bread!!! I always get tons of compliments. So simple to make and freezes beautifully.  I like to sprinkle some extra cinnamon sugar on top before baking.  It makes for a yummy little sweetness all the way around (since the pan is already coated in it...)

This recipe turned out way too sweet.  I followed the recipe, but left out the cinnamon, which I can't imagine would make that much of a difference in the sweetness.  My bread was moist, but it's too sugary and not bananay enough.  If you make this recipe, definitely cut back on the sugar.

One of our family favorites. Moist, tasty, excellent. I split it into 2 9x5 bread pans. Very full, huge loaves. Cooks quite a bit longer and i cover with foil when top gets dark. we have large fam so bigger loaves is good.

This is such a fantastic recipe.  Yes, the sour cream really does cut the sugar and gives it a nice, nice tang although very subtle.  I followed the recipe precisely but I cut out all the cinnamon, only because I love the taste of the bananas and vanilla on their own.    I didn't have but one of the pans called for in the recipe, but I had some LeCrueset bread pans that were very similar in size, so I used those.  I filled the pans a bit too full because it really rose nice and high!  Next time, will fill all the pans only half full and use the remaining batter to make muffins.  I used my kitchenAid mixer and used Speed 1 to stir in the flour.  My bread was still nicely dense and not light.. so the trick is to stir in the flour slowly at the end.  Also, I sifted my flour, which helped to mix it in much more evenly.  Very good.  Thanks for sharing Esther!  Now my ONLY go to banana bread recipe!

Yum yum in the tum tum.  My only suggestion is to let people know to only fill the pans just over half way.  I filled one of the too high and it over flowed.  The others turned out beautiful though.  Also I did have to leave them in about a 30-45 minutes longer then the recipe says becasue they weren't cooking.   But they are still moist and WONDERFULLY  YUMMY!!!!

Fantastic!  Moist and delicious.  I added mini chocolate chips to one loaf, left the other one plain.  I didn't do the sugar/cinnamon coating because I was trying cut down on sugar.  These were made as a little Valentine's gift for my secret crush and he proclaimed them to be "Amazing", especially the chocolate chip loaf.  I will definitely make this bread again.

Very good banana bread!  I like the suggestion of lining the bread pans with cinnamon/sugar mixture.  I used up the extra as a topping on the bread.  It turned out really yummy, with a sweet crunchy crust.  This recipe makes a lot of bread.  Which is great, I froze 4 small loaves, and have 1 large loaf we are gobbling up right now.  It is very moist and deliciuos,  I will definitely make this again.

I am utterly disappointed. I prepared this recipe exactly as it was written and my loaves were totally undercooked and gooey. I baked them for an extra 20 minutes and still didn't help. And the taste was bland and unremarkable. I had to ditch the bread and it was supposed to be a birthday present for my friend.

My first time making banana bread... it is delicious. It's soft a tasty in the middle and the top has a wonderful crust. I used the fat free sour cream, as I always buy low fat if it's available and still thought this bread was amazing. The only problem was that I didn't realize it makes four loaves and my mixer isn't large enough so I had to split it up half way through.. this resulted in 2 loafs of banana nut (with the optional walnuts) and 2 loaves chocolate chip. Next time I will halve the recipe for simplicity of mixing in one bowl.

Good stuff, but I wouldn't call it "great".  I followed the recipe as stated, but left out the cinnamon/sugar coating.  The resulting bread has a really nice consistency -- definitely a "classic" banana bread feel -- and the loaves remained good even without refrigeration for 3 days.  The taste was a little bland, however.  Surprising, because the BATTER tasted really really good!    I didn't have any 7x3 loaf pans, so I had to use 3 8x3.8 inch loaf pans + a mini muffin pan instead.  Cooking time at 300 degrees had to be lengthened by about 45 minutes to cook the loaves all the way through (muffins were done in 30 mins).  If I were to make this again, I'd probably try adding something else to the batter to give it a kick -- maybe some dried cranberries, or some rum.  It was really nice bread, but it just needs something more.

Very yummy! I made a 1/2 of recipe and it made two 7 X 3 loaf pans and 4 mini bunt pans (sixe of an ex large cupcake) and came out wonderful! I think the ones that are complaining about it not being done after 1 hr may be useing larger loaf pans. The addition of the cin & sugar on the inside of the pan is wonderful! I think next time I make it I may use banana extract instead of the vinilla just to see how that tastes. I can't wait for my hubby to get home and taste it!! He is a banana nut bread freak!! This won't last long at my house ... :)

I bake for a living and I'm not usually wowed by recipes I find on here but this recipe was exceptional (I joined just so I could review it). I halved it- since I didn't think I'd want or need 4 loaves but after trying it I immediately regretted that decision. The texture and flavor are pretty much perfect- I don't feel that it required any tweaking  and will probably use it from now on. Thank you!

This is a great recipe!  Be sure to do the sugar/cinnamon dusting of the pans.  My hubby loved that!  Bread was moist and flavorful.  Will definitely make again.

AWESOME!!! I absolutely love this recipe! Before I began, I was a bit concerned about the batter sticking to my pans-since the only thing between the pan and the batter was grease and sugar, instead of flour. I should never have worried. It didn't stick at all! I made a half recipe and did make some changes (the review by Saralady19 was very helpful): I did not have enough sour cream so had to sub in mayonnaise for about 1/2 the amount, I used 2 eggs, hand mixed the dry ingredients into the wet, used pecans, to half the amount of batter I also added chocolate chips, and on the loaf without the choc. chips I added a streusel topping. Baked it at 325 F. I don't think I will EVER even try another banana bread recipe!! :-)

I fail to see how one would find this recipe difficult....I don't bake! I just got tired of looking at black bananas so in 30 minutes this was in the oven....The toothpick trick is as basic a tool as I needed.....My kids give the recipe a thumbs up...That's all I need;)....TOO EASY!

I thought I had a good banana bread recipe, but after I made this, my husband insists that from now on I only make the "banana sour cream bread". It's moist and rich with banana goodness. I just wish I could whiddle the ingredients down to 1 loaf successfully.

Very good recipe.  First time I used the cinn/sugar mixture as a coating and I really liked that idea.  I used 3 9x5 loaf pans and baked them for 1hr 5 mins and they turned out beautifully.  These were gifts so I didn't put the walnuts.  When I make this for myself and family, I will definetely use the nuts.

So good. I think this is one I would like to perfect. Husband wasn't so crazy about the sour cream taste but I loved it. I left out half a cup of flour by accident and it still tasted good.

Loved this recipe.  I have a banana bread recipe that I've been making for years and thought I would try something different.  I am so glad I did.  Loved this.  Added chocolate chips to make it that much more healthier ; )  Good stuff.

I cut this recipe in half and used 1 9x5 in pan at 350 for 1 hr 10 min and it was delicious.  I filled up 2/3 of the pan with the batter.  The next morning I put the leftover batter in muffin pans at 350 for 30 minutes and it was great too.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Perfected in every way. I have made this recipe so many times and it always comes out the same way. Ive given this bread wrapped in plastic wrap with a ribbon tied around it with a bible verse attatched. Great scripture bread or just to eat at home or anywhere. Ships great sent some to reletives for thanksgiving this year. I also tried to put instead of nuts, chocolate chips. Turned out fantastically. Also before baking i sprinkled cinnamon and sugar because i had extra and it came out with an excellent crisp brown top with a moist inside. Perfect recipe in every way. Thanks so much!

So moist, full of banana flavor and delicious.  I used half brown/half granulated sugar and half cake flour/half all purpose for a lighter touch.  This is one I will be making again and again.  It would be excellent with streusel topping or drizzled with cream cheese icing.

Award Winning!  I made this bread using the exact recipe - minus the nuts - and entered it in a quick bread baking contest at work.  I won first prize.  I would say winning a baking contest with this recipe is the highest praise you can offer.  Thanks for providing such a wonderful recipe!

The texture of this bread is terrific.  It is nice a moist and tender with a great spicy flavor.  The problem is that it does not have enough banana flavor.  I will definitely add about 4 more bananas next time I make it.

This was my first time ever making banana bread and I am SO happy I came across this recipe!!  Like many other reviews noted, the baking temp should be 325 and it does take a little over an hour to bake(but all ovens are different).  I covered mine with foil after 45 mins and they turned out PERFECT!!  I highly recommend making this bread!  Thanks for sharing!!!!!

Fabulous! Made it for my sunday school class and everyone raved. I followed the recipe exactly. The only difference was that I used light sour cream (since that is what I had on hand) and I had to bake 10 min longer than what the recipe said. Will definitely make again!

Really like this but thought it a little too sweet. I didn't use the sugar/cinnamon dusting in the pans and I substituted 1.5 cups of whole wheat flour for white and it worked out fine. Next time I'll cut the sugar & maybe try using yogurt to lighten it up a little...but yummy!

This is outstanding banana bread!  So moist and tender.  And I love the addition of the cinnamon.  I made 1/2 recipe, used 2 eggs and light sour cream.  Next time I will double the cinnamon sugar mixture and sprinkle on top as well.

Great bread, but like others I made a few changes... I made two loaves out of the recipe and had to bake at 325 for an hour and 10 mins then at 300 for another 30 mins or so to get the center done.  The crust didn't burn but was hardened.  Substituted cinnamon applesauce for the butter and 1.5 c of splenda with 1.5c of sugar.  Also used fat free sour cream, and eggbeaters, was delicous warm, haven't tried it cold yet!

I just finished a batch of this bread which I made into muffins simply for the convenience. It was very good- moist and not to sweet. I was a little disappointed in the lack of banana flavor though - I ended up adding four additional bananas just to get the flavor to where I thought it should be for banana bread. That aside, this is a very good recipe!

This was really good banana bread and I have made many.  I added big chunks of walnuts, yum.  I also halved the recipe since it took so many bananas, wish I hadn't since then I only got one big loaf, always prefer to get two, either for freezing or gifting.

I cut down on the sugar by 1 cup, and the banana bread was just sweet enough. I also reserved some of the batter and added some melted dark chocolate to the mix and spread it down the center of the loaves. Great recipe, but like many other members I found that it did take a long time to bake since I baked in 2 9 inch loaves. But it was well worth the wait!  Thanks for the recipe!

If you are tempted to bake this in two large bread-sized loaf pans, DON'T do it. I did and the results were not good. It took an hour and a half at 300. The loaves looked beatuful and released from the pans perfectly, but when we cut into them, they were like a brick of pudding. I'm gong to try this again in smaller or maybe even mini-pans.

it is quite sweet ... but the sour cream makes a fabulous balance. i sprinkled my pan with turbinado sugar (large crystals) ... added a beautiful crunch. i also doubled the cinnamon. oh ... and i used half sour cream, half natural yogurt to drop the calories ... rich without being too naughty

I was sceptical when the recipe called for sour cream. After the bread was done, I was amazed that the sour cream could not be tasted. I am not a big sour cream fan but I would definitely recommend this recipe.

OK....what did I do wrong?  I read a lot of reviews before making this.  I halfed the recipe with 11/2 c. sugar, used 2 eggs, 1t. cinammon etc.  I used 3 bananas. Got two breads out of it but they were brown even on the inside, not light colored like banana bread, and didn't taste like banana bread.  It was more like a spice/cinammon bread and I did not add any other spices.  HELP????  What did I do wrong? Thanks!!

Awesome banana bread! Halved the recipe and added the streusel topping. Baked it at 350 for a little over an hour. Wonderfully moist and flavorful. Best banana bread I've ever made, and I've tried several recipes. This one's a definite keeper.

Yum! This recipe has now replaced the banana bread recipe my mother used to make and passed on to me. I used Greek yoghurt as I didn't have sour cream and it was deliciou. I also used chopped pecan nuts which I had lighly toasted first. I made two large loaves and 12 muffins. I sliced up one of the loaves and put them in the freezer individually wrapped. I take out one slice each day for packed lunches and by lunch time they are perfectly defrosted and taste as though just baked. A lovely recipe, thank you.

I halved the recipe and followed it exactly (used 1 egg since it called for 1 1/2 eggs) and it came out PERFECT. I'm not the best baker but this was easy and fast to put together. Definitely will make again!!

I haven't made banana bread in many years and am not the best baker. I made this exactly as stated other than quantity. I only had 4 bananas so I recalculated for 22 servings and used 2 larger loaf pans (didn't have the other sizes). It was very flavorful and moist. I have other family recipes but I will keep this one for my own! Thank you!

It was moist, and not as dense as a more traditional banana bread which I really do prefer. I used 7 smaller bananas, and it gave me 2 cups and a third banana mashed. I also added half teaspoon of nutmeg, and quarter teaspoon of cloves. I like to put nutmeg in as many recipes as I can, it adds a great touch to the fall spices and goes beautifully with the bananas. I substituted using brown sugar for half of the sugar, doing half white and half brown sugar for more flavor. I did not use nuts, but added 2 cups of chocolate chips, and made two normal sized loaves, and one slightly smaller. I did not think the adding the sugar cinnamon was a big added factor for taste. The sour cream really does keep it moist. I also baked at 325 and not the lower temp of 300, for an hour and fifteen minutes.

Very moist and very good flavor.  The cinnamon and sugar in the pans give it a little extra something;o)  I made these in mini muffin pans for my kids and they loved them. I think adding a brown sugar crumble to the tops could make this extra special.

So delicious.  I made three 9x5 loaves and baked at 325 as suggested by other reviews.  We ate a whole loaf right out of the oven.  My kindergartener had a friend over and we sent a loaf home with him so we wouldn't eat it all ourselves.

This bread was excellent! It was very moist and tasteful. I omitted the nuts. I am not a big fan of nuts in my food. I only used 2 cups of sugar and added a 1/2 cup of applesauce. I also sprinkled one with cinnamon/sugar mix and one with brown sugar.I will be using this recipe again.I have tried other banana bread recipes in the past and this is by far the best one.

Unbelievable!!!  The most moist bread I have ever made.  It must be the sour cream that does the trick.  I thought for sure I had messed the whole thing up because I forgot to put in the eggs.  I put the bread in the oven and turned around to see the eggs sitting on the counter.  Ugghh...But to my surprise it still turned out great.  It did take approx 1hr and 1 minutes to get done. I also loved the sprinkle of cinammon and sugar in the bottom of the dish.  Overall an excellent recipe.  Thanks!!

This banana bread was awesome. It was fluffy and cake like which I really like opposed to the super dense banana bread. I used plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream and no one could tell a difference...everyone just ate it all up!

This banana bread was fantastic!  My entire family loved it - and the sugar/cinnamon coating on the crust is a great addition.

Yummy and moist as a good banana bread should be! If you don't have six bananas this will come out just as good. The smell permeated through the house drawing a little crowd in the kitchen ready to pounce the minute this came out of the oven. Nice toasted the next day with aaahhhh yes a bit more butter! Okay, I know the (AHA) American Heart Association won't advocate my little suggestion... It freezes well if you want to make this in advance.

Always a major hit with my family. I add a cup of skor bits aswell which makes it a little trickier to get out of the pan, but also adds a sweet chewy taste that my boyfriend loves!

This was amazing.  I have never liked banana bread, but decided I would try this b/c of the reviews.  My boyfriend and I ate 2 loaves within 3 days...it is so good. The only thing I did was add some brown sugar b/c I love brown sugar. If it isn't finished cooking in an hour just leave it in a little longer.  Mine turned out perfect when cooked at 325 for 1 hour.  Thank you!

This bread was DEEEElicious!! I added mini chocolate chips and crumb topping as others have mentioned. Try slicing bread about 1 inch thick and frying in butter in a cast iron skillet. It gets all caramelized and sticky!!

This was really  really good. Definitely a dessert bread. I added chocolate chips to mine. I like to have my banana bread a little  doughy in the middle. FYI you dont need to under cook for that for this recipe. In fact if you dont like your bread doughy I would cooking it about 5 minutes longer or so.

This is great banana bread! I was worried about it tasting a little sour, but it wasn't. I halved the recipe, but since you can't halve an egg really and I only had one anyway, I substituted an extra banana in and only added one egg. Delicious breakfast on the go if made in muffin tins! Also baked at 350 and watched them closely so they wouldn't burn. UPDATE: If you can, weigh the sour cream!! I purchased a too-large tub of sour cream for the first batch so I ended up using a scale to weigh the correct amount. It turned out very moist. The second time I just bought the correct size tub and added the ingredients without weighing it. It wasn't nearly as moist. Weigh if you can!

The best banana bread I've ever tried! I used 16 oz of previously frozen (about to expire)strawberry/banana yogurt instead of sour cream, 5 bananas, (all I had) and added 1 tsp nutmeg. It made 2 large 9x6 loaves, baked @325 for 85 minutes. The cinnamon sugar on top is great! One loaf supposed to be given away but kids didnt' know and they devoured both. Looking forward to trying different yogurt flavors.

This banana bread is excellent!   I had to use a bit of oil as I only had 1/2c of butter and I substituted plain nonfat yogurt for the sour cream.   I like that it makes a lot and so do my neighbors!

I have to agree with all the reviews. This is an awesome recipe. The only thing I do differently and it's only because of personal taste, is take out a couple of tablespoons of sourcream and replace it with amaretto liquor or almond extract. It gives this recipe a little extra perfection. But even without the change this is the best banana bread I've ever had.

I've never made banana bread before and this turned out excellent.  Really moist and delicious.  I had to cook it almost 1/2 longer but that was not a big deal.  I sprinkled the cinnamon sugar mixture all over the inside of the pan and then on top of the bread before baking.  Really delicious.  Freezes well.

This bread is amazing! I will definitely be making it again. I was hesitant to use non-fat sour cream, to cut the fat, but it actually turned out great and didn't change the texture of the bread. I added some allspice and nutmeg based on other reviewer's suggestions, and it tasted great.

Great recipe. Try making this with soft brown sugar for an even yummier caramel taste! Also make extra cinnamon sugar and coat the top. Delicious!

I hate to give bad reviews.  The taste was amazing, but the bread didn't bake through even with a longer baking time.  It was raw and gummy and the bottom halves of the loaves stuck in the pan.  We still ate some of it and as I said, the flavor was terrific, but it wasn't bread.  Sorry.

This recipe turned out well. I made a few adjustments, increased temp to 325 and cooked for about an hour and 10 mins. In addition, I used yogurt instead of sour cream (because all I had was ff sour cream) and added chocolate chips. Turned out moist and delicious. Good recipe.

I have tried so many recipes and never overly thrilled with any until this one. Loved it, not only easy to make, it is moist and delicious. Will never search for another banana bread recipe again!

Followed the recipe as is, except I only had 3 pans. It turned out perfect! I just had to increase the baking time.

Loved this recipe.  I was looking for the right recipe for a banana strawberry mix and this worked.  I cut back on the amount of sour cream because the strawberries would provide a bit of a pop.  I did, however, have to cook it longer than one hour.  At 300 mine took about 1 1/2 hours!

one word - addictive.  how could it not be with those indgredients.  very moist with a wonderful flavor.  i just put it in 3 loaf pans and it was perfect. thank you!!!!!!!!
2nd time made I put in a couple pinches of nutmeg and just a little less cloves.  Delicious!!!!!!!!
Update 3/6/17:  I made this as stated, except for 1/2 c. less sugar and replaced 1 c. of white with brown sugar; made 3 loaves.  Cooked for 48 minutes.  Delicious!!
Update 4/1/17: only used 2 c. of sugar (1 white, 1 brown) and it was still delicious!

I made half a batch of this recipe, and used 2 eggs (not one and a half!). I had about 1/2 cup leftover pumpkin puree which I threw into the whole thing along with my bananas. I also used low fat sour cream. I got one loaf and 24 mini muffins out of it!!!! I was sooo moist and so tender and delicious. Worked out perfect, even with LOW fat sour cream! thanks a lot for sharing, we all loved it!!

This is my new favourite banana bread recipe.  The bread came out bursting with flavour, moist and rich-tasting.  I also tried to do muffins with this recipe, but the bread turned out much better.  It is so moist that the muffins didn't hold together.  You could easily customize this recipe by adding fruit, nuts, chocolate chips, etc.  Simply delicious!

This is the VERY BEST!  I do substitute 1/2 the sugar with splenda and add the recommended increase in baking soda and powdered milk (formula on the splenda pkg).  I use all splenda/cinnamon for the sprinkling in the pan.  My husband whines when I give any away :)

This bread is phenomenal. I've made it three times now. I've had friends request it; everyone loves it. I followed the recipe exactly. My only recommendation is letting it cool completely before eating. I always make it the night before eating so by morning all the flavors have combined. Bread is so moist and delicious!

Halved recipe and used 4 ounces of unsweetened applesauce in place of the butter called for.  I was going to make 2 loaves but realized I have only 1 loaf pan.  To save time I poured into a 7x11" brownie pan and baked @ 325 degrees for 1 hour 5 minutes. It came out perfectly baked.  Next time I will substitute some splenda to cut the calories down even more.  This recipe is good at 4 stars but the 'Banana Crumb Muffin' recipe from this site is better at 5 stars.

I do love this recipe... have tried a lot of the suggestions and haven't had any trouble... I often use ground flax seed for half the amount of flour and still have great results... I also love to add chopped strawberries or other fruit... not that it needs the added moistness as it is always lovely!!!! DEFINATELY A FAN!!!

Made this as muffins.  Baked at 325 x40 min.  Used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 regular flour.  Also decreased the fat by replacing 1/2 the butter with applesauce.  Kids loved them!

My boyfriend and I love this stuff... perfect when there are leftover bananas. We do like to add extra sour cream and chocolate chips though, as well as using a little less sugar, and only brown sugar for the bread.

I have made this recipe several times now, and each time the response I get is "This is the best banana bread I have ever had".  Too bad I can't take credit for the recipe! I do make sure to put the bananas into the mixer so that you don't end up with lumps... The lumps end up looking and feeling like the bread isn't baked completely.  Also, I never have four 7 x 3 loaf pans... I used a regular loaf pan & 1 bundt pan for my last batch, but did have to increase baking time by 30 minutes (approx).  Came out great!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

This banana bread was beautifully moist and tasty.  When I made it, I halved the recipe and reduced the sugar by a half-cup and added an extra banana.  In the future, I will add a few more spices -  nutmeg and some clove, would definitely be a fragrant and welcome addition.  And, for fun I'll add some chocolate chips. I think white chocolate or milk chocolate would be a tasty and decadent addition.

Very good recipe.  I followed it exactly.  I did not have 4 loaf pans, so I purchased the alluminum foil, disposible ones & the loaves I baked in those had to be baked slightly longer than the ones in the ones in my regular pans.  But all turned out great.

Yummy and moist! The only downfall is that it comes out flat, unlike the ones we buy at cafes...

This truly lives up to its reviews.  Moist, delicious.  My husband, who loves banana bread, deemed this the best he'd ever had.  I don't know why some complained of it being too cake-like.  Mine was perfectly dense and moist.  It helps to add the sugar about one quarter at a time, but it will still be grainy.  Not to fret.  The only time I used my mixer was to incorporate the wet ingredients into the butter mixture.  I incorporated the flour a little at a time by hand.  Maybe this helped it to keep it dense?  I only had two loaf pans, one large and one medium, but they held all the batter.  I baked at 325 degrees for more about 75 minutes.  Absolutely worth trying.  I didn't bother with a crumb topping, save that for coffee cakes!  Enjoy!

First time I have made Banana Bread and I could not have found a better recipe! This turned out awesome! It was all gone in 2 days and everyone wanted more! The only thing I did different was instead of nuts I put in oats.... YUMMY!!!!

This is an amazing Banana Bread. I cut the recipe in half and I baked it in one loaf pan at 325 for a hour. Don't worry about the butter and sugar not creaming. It doesn't affect the outcome which is a great Banana Bread.

This tastes good, but more like cake than bread.  I also think the heat is too low, I wouldn't cook it at less than 325.

Great recipe!  Very moist and easy to make.  I used both walnuts and pecans and used brown sugar on the bottom of the pan rather than white sugar.  Yummy!

this recipe is out of this world!  i live alone so i made this as muffins instead of loaves and it was wonderful!  i also added a little nutmeg and ginger and it turned out as good as a dessert!  i would recommend putting the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture on the top but it is great on the bottom also!

Wow! I've tried many variations of banana bread recipes and this one is the best! Changes:  A full batch fits perfectly into 2- 5 1/2 X 9" Loaf pans,  Baked at 325 for 1 hour 15 minutes Added 1 tbsp Epicure Apple Pie Spice (cinnimon, cloves, nutmeg...) Light Sour Cream worked great! Thank-you Esther!

I guess I can't fault the recipe, but I had a real bad experience with this. I baked this loaf, and it tastes like going to visit my grandma, and she lives in a home. I got real upset when I thought about the food my grandma has to eat because she can't live alone anymore. My girlfriend wouldn't eat any because I had cried on the loaf.

I LOVE this bread! It's easy and taste awesome and by using non-fat sour cream, is pretty healthy too.  I might use a little less sugar than called for next time, but I used an extra banana too so that probably made it a little sweeter.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Really good! Given all the rave reviews I think I had my hopes up a little high but it was great. I made it just as written- except I added a little leftover cinnamon/sugar mixture to the top of the loaves before baking. Definetly  make again!

I make quite a few adjustments to make it much healthier and its extra tasty when you know its not so bad. I also do about a half batch because i cant count on 6 bananas in the house that long.   325* oven  -1 Cup applesauce (Motts natural) - 3/4 cup white sugar - 1/2 cup brown sugar (measured without packing it in) - 1 Egg - 1 Egg white - 2 Large overripe bananas - 8 Oz lite sour cream - 1 teaspoon vanilla - 1 generous teaspoon of cinammon - 1.5 teaspoons of baking soda - 2 cups Whole Wheat Flour - 1/2 cup chopped walnuts  I like to bake em muffin style - which takes 25 minutes if you fill the cups half way.  A thinner loaf takes about 45 minutes.

This was very moist.  I halved the recipe and made it in a bundt pan.  It took just under an hour to bake that way.  I left out the walnuts and added mini choco chips.

Excellent.  I love the yummy dusting of sugar and cinnamon in the pan before baking.  Kids can't get enough of it.  This last time I made it, I used half whole wheat flour and half white flour.  Couldn't tell any difference.  Always good to sneak in a little more wholesome goodness!  It does get a little gooey if kept sealed in a plastic bag, however.

I don't like bananas but have family members who like banana bread.  They have raved about this bread. My brother, the chief of the family, told me this recipe was a keeper.  He liked the crunchy sides and bottom created by the sugar/cinnamon.  He told me this is the most flavorable and moist banana bread he has ever had.

This bread tasted awesome!!! I haven't made banana bread before so I don't have much to compare it to, but it was great nonetheless. 
One note...this makes A LOT of bread so be mindful of that before you start.

Wow, this recipe is AWESOME!! I read a great many of the reviews, and picked up some great tips...I halved the recipe, substituted some brown sugar in place of white, added a dash of allspice & cloves, and baked it in one standard size loaf pan at 325 for about and hour and a half (my oven sucks, make sure you check yours half way thru baking) and topped it off with a brownsugar/butter/flour/cinnamon streusel topping...and I LOVE IT! So far I'm the only one who's tried it, but I bet my family will flip for it!
I'm adding this to my permanent recipe file, and wish I'd tried it before Christmas!

This is amazing!!!!  I didn't have a loaf pan so I used a 12 muffin pan instead.  I also used 1 C. butter.  I heavily dusted the muffin pan with the sugar mixture and also put more of the sugar mixture on top of the muffin before baking.  I baked them for 25 minutes at 300.  These turned out fabulous!!!!!!!!!!!!!  THANK YOU!!!

Thanks for this awesome recipe. It's always a big hit. Some modifications that worked wonderfully: 2 1/2 cups sugar instead of 3, I added 1 more banana, I used whole wheat flower and since my husband doens't eat dairy, I used Tofutti "Better Than Sour Cream" and Earth Balance instead of butter. This bread still comes out moist, dense and delicious!

Best banana bread recipe! I just slightly modified it, I used two cups of sugar and half a cup of light brown sugar. I also like addding a pinch of ground nutmeg.

Great recipe! One time I made it and I was short on bananas and substituted 2 small shredded zuchini for 2 of the bananas. Excellent. All my friends have requested the recipe.

The best, most moist banana bread I have ever made (and I've made hundreds of loaves over the years!).  I made 1/2 of a batch, dividing everything exactly as written (even the egg!) and baked it in two aluminum med-size loaf pans until toothpick came clean in the center.  This is by far my favorite recipe.  AWESOME!

Delicious! Tweaked a bit: 1 stick butter (1/2 c.) & 2 oz applesauce. Used 2 1/2 c. whole wheat flour & 2 c. all purpose flour. 2 c. sugar was plenty with the cinnamon/sugar dusting in the pans (which is a nice touch). I almost never use the whole amount of sugar called for in recipes.

Absolutely delicious. Be prepared to use a large bowl for prep. I did not have 7x3 inch loaf pans, so I filled up 2 larger loaf pans about 3/4 full, upped the oven temp to 325 and checked after one hour. After one hour the middle was still undercooked, so I added 15 minutes, and checked then - perfect! Very moist, inexpensive to prepare, and makes a lot. I did not have any problem with rising, the bread was dense but not too heavy. I think it would also be delicious with bittersweet or semi-sweet chocolate chips.

This was really good, I didn't notice the sour cream and didn't find it too sweet. I'll make half the recipe next time, I had 5 5x3 mini loaf pans, and it made that plus 6 regular muffins and an entire tray of mini muffins.

this was really easy to make.  i didn't have super ripe bananas, i had just ripe ones, and they worked out just fine.  i ran out of sugar, so i used splenda instead, and they tasted great.  but had a weird after taste, that i'm assuming is from the splenda.  i spooned the batter into a muffin tin, and made 12 good sized banana muffins.  i also baked them for 35 minutes.  good stuff!

OH YUM!!  I found the cake to be just great.  I was a little thrown by the sour cream, but it made the cake very moist.  I did 3rd the recipe because I didn't have that many brown bananas - it still turned out great.  
Does any one know if this freezes well?

this is the only banana bread recipe i'll ever make again!!  it was so easy and so moist.  I made it with the intention of bringing some to work to share, but it never made it out of the house.  Dee-lish.  I added chocolate chips of course, because banana bread is not banana bread with out chocolate chips!

I would say this recipe is just alright.  Just two days earlier, I tried the "Banana banana bread" recipe and it was much much better and developed a much nicer crust than this one.  Further, I baked my loaves at 350 for 1.5 hrs, and it still wasn't enough- I had to bake them for another 20 mins.  All in all, I think banana bread can be made much better and easier.

A most excellent recipe!  I did it the low cal way also.  I made the 4 loaf recipe but put 4 Tbls butter and 1/2 cup chunky applesauce.  1 1/2 cups splenda and 1 1/2 cups sugar.  Also used light sour cream and pecans in place of the walnuts.  Cooked the loaves at 325 for about 1 hour 5 minutes and they came out perfect!

Excellant recipe... really moist with the sour cream. I used cashews that I had on hand instead of walnuts and I substituted the sugar for splenda and was quite happy with the result. I did 1/2 of the recipe and ended up with one loaf pan and about 6 muffins.

This is delicious.  I halved this recipe and it was so good!!!  The sour cream is a great addition and the bread was so moist.  We had a hard time waiting for it to cool down enough so we didn't burn our mouths eating it.  My favorite banana bread recipe now.

This was all right. I've actually got a banana bread recipe I've been making for years and really like, but was looking for something different -- just to mix things up. This wasn't it. This was just more sugary and fattening without tasting much different.

this is by far  the best banana bread recipe i have tried here, better than the ones with buttermilk. i decreased the sugar to 1/2 a cup and put it in two smaller loaf pans and baked 325 degrees for one hour, covering with foil for the last 15 minutes so that the top doesnt burn. turned out perfect! very moist and flavorful.

Great recipe!  I've made these with sour cream and Stonyfield's Banilla yogurt and they turned out awesome both times.  I made them into muffins instead of  bread and cut the baking time back to about 40-45 minutes.  I also didn't have vanilla so I used almond extract, but cut the amount in half.

I love banana bread and this recipe is amazing. I have never tasted such a moist banana bread! :)... I like to use some cinnamon sugar throughout this recipe and also added chocolate chips. Everyone at home and work loved getting a slice of this! Thanks very much... will definitely keep this recipe on hand ;). 2 Thumbs up!

I grew up on Banana Bread and I always thought my mom's recipe was the best (which it is great!), but now that I'm out of college and thousands of miles away I figure I would find my own recipes... this bread turned out fantastic.  My boyfriend loved it and he's not as big on breads as I am.  I didn't have the full amount of sour cream on hand, so I improvised and added some Apple Sauce, which only added to the moistness!

*Yummy tip: make it breadfast on the go or a snack by cutting yourself a slice of bread, cut that slice in half, spread cream cheese on the bread, and put the slices together like you would a sandwich... verrry good tip from my childhood!

JUST THE BEST
  This was wonderful. I did change a few things. For half a recipe I used 1 cup of sugar, thinking banana's are sweet enough and I was right. I used 4 banana,s, and 1 cup of chopped nuts. I also baked it at 350 and it took approx. a little over an hour. I tested it with a tooth pick. 
   DON'T OVER BAKE!!

Wow!! I am not easily impressed but I LOVED how this turned out. I reduced the sugar by 1/2 c. because I made a crumble topping that I got from another review (1/2 c. brown sugar, 3 T. butter, 1/2 c. flour, 1 t. cinnamon). It was amazing. I am very proud of this bread!! I ate a mini loaf by myself haha. It looks beautiful and the crust gives it a wonderful taste and color. I baked at 325 for a little over an hour (the mini loaves were ready in 45 min. though). This recipe made 3 regular loaves and 2 mini loaves. You won't be dissapointed, trust me!

SO GOOD!!!  I baked at 300 for almost an hour and a half and it came out perfect and very moist.  Also, I only made half of the recipe and it only made one loaf instead of two.  I did half white/half brown sugar.  Next time I'm going to try some of the healthy substitutions from other reviews.

Don't bother looking at any other banana bread recipes This one is so delicious. I did divide the batter and used chocolate chips for half and pecans in the other half. I made three loaves and twelve muffins. I cooked the muffins for thirty minutes. Great for breakfast on the run.

I changed a few things.

I halved the recipe, added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp ground cloves to the mix. I used fat free organic vanilla yoghurt instead of sour cream, and a tbsp more butter. I left out the nuts, because I´m allergic. I baeked it for 50mins. I took this to my sister-in-laws baby shower and it was the only dish that was completely finished- in two hours! A keeper.

This is my favorite Banana Bread I've made so far! Very moist. I did bake at 325 not 300 and it turned out perfect.I also have made this both with and without the crumbly topping and it is out of this world with the crumbly topping. I used the butter, brown sugar, flour & cinnaman topping. Wonderful!

This bread was okay.  I felt that the sugar on the outside made it too sticky and not what I was looking for.  I may make again and not use the sugar crusting.

Love it!  Definitely add a dash nutmeg and ground cloves and make it with the crumble topping: 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 c all purpose flour, 2-3 T room temp butter, 1 t cinnamon, mix and spoon over loaves before baking.  All around crowd pleaser!  Thanks so much for sharing.

Phenomenal, truly.  I followed the instructions to bake at 325 for 1 hour 10 minutes.  I also added an extra banana because I'll be shipping some of it and a 1/4 cup extra sour cream because we buy it in bulk at Sam's and I need to use it.  

Most fabulous banana bread I have ever tasted or made.  I've been making it for years like my grandmother did.  Hers is wonderful, too, but this truly takes the cake.  Not overly sweet or dense (mix in dry ingredients by hand), intensely moist, and caramelized crust.  I would, however, suggest adding more cinnamon and nutmeg.  Maybe even double it?  Wow.  Delicious.

For a lower-fat/calories modification of this recipe, user "Lisa" posted an EXCELLENT alternative. 
Instead of the butter, she used 1/2c applesauce, 1/4c olive oil, and 1 1/4c sugar.
I went with a no-sugar added applesauce, 'light-tasting' olive oil (mainly to use it up... I have nothing against olive oil flavor :)), and 1c white sugar, 1/4c brown sugar.
I also went with 2 1/2 c AP flour, 2c whole wheat flour. Also 'light' sour cream.
Made the whole thing in my mixer, and it's very moist and spongy, and perfectly sweet...I think backing off on the sugar would still yield a good bread.

I couldn't believe how fast this was eaten. My family loved it. They said it was good and moist. The cinnamon and sugar added so much flavor to it. I think I will even sprinkle some on top next time.

I'm going to give this 5 stars, because even with my tinkering it still had great flavor.  I reduced the sugar by a half cup.  I also replaced the butter with applesause and the eggs with flaxseed (1TBS ground flaxseed + 3TBS water to every 1 egg).  Also used half whole wheat flour.  I didn't get my baking temperatures and timing just right (made the mistake of trying to bake it hotter) and the texture wasn't bready enough because of that, in combination with the flaxseed.  But even so, they tasted wonderful and froze beautifully.  Be warned, this is a big recipe.  I baked four mini loafs, 12 large muffins, and 24 mini muffins.  I froze the mini loafs and have been bringing them out to thaw over night for the last couple of weeks.  My kids love them with breakfast.

This is the best Banana Bread Recipe EVER!!!  The bread is so moist.  I didn't change a thing about the recipe - except I only had 4 Large bananas handy and it still had an awesome banana flavor.  It will melt in your mouth- forget about halving it- triple it!!! :-)

I have been making this banana bread for several months.  We love it.  I do add extra spices to the bread itself, but the texture and use of sour cream is great!

I made it with Splenda, which may have changed it a little. Next time, I will use less sugar and add more spices.

Absolutely loved this recipe!!!  I followed the suggestion of the one cook and halved the recipe and increased the temperature.  The last 5-10 minutes I had to adjust accordingly.

I've made many banana breads from this site and this is one of two that I really like.  The other one is made with buttermilk instead of sour cream.  They are both terrific.

I'm sure that it tastes best just using the original recipe without modifications. However, I wasn't looking to impress anyone with a knockout recipe, rather just needing to use up ripe Bananas into a somewhat healthy treat for my family. I took 3 reviewers advice and combined their suggestions.  The results were exactly what I was looking for. I halfed the recipe and these were the measurments I used: 1 T. Butter, 1/8 c. Olive Oil, 1/2 C. Applesauce, 1 C. Splenda, 1/2 c. Sugar, 1 Egg + 3 Egg whites, Light Sour Cream, 1 c. Whole Wheat flour, 1 1/4 All Purpose Flour. I love nuts so I used about 1 1/2 c. chopped walnuts. I also used a dash of Nutmeg and Cloves as one reviewer suggested. I baked it in a bundt for 1 hour at 325. Turned out fabulous! I'm not sure I will be making the "correct version" any time soon as this is plenty sweet and delicious even with the healthy changes!

One word...perfection! Followed the recipe perfectly and it was super moist and had the best flavor of banana. I didn't have four loaf pans so I decided to put some in muffin pans for only thirty minutes and those turned out wonderful too. I will definitely be making this recipe again. I did the low fat sour cream as the only slight modification, but I can't imagine the regular sour cream making it taste any better than it did. The only hard part is waiting days for the bananas to ripen (but putting them in a brown bag does speed up the process).

AMAZING!  This is the best banana bread I have ever tasted - unbelievably moist.  I did follow the advise of others and spinkled sugar and cinnamon on top so I would have a nice crunchy crust but a soft and moist inside.  We prefer our banana bread dense instead of light and fluffy, so again I followed  advise of previous posters to mix in the flour by hand instead of using an electric mixer.  This turned out perfect.  I didn't change any ingredients. I was able to do two big loaves and a big pan of muffins (I cooked those at 300 degrees about 18-20 minutes - depending on the size of your muffin tins.)  Definitely will make again! UPDATE: 7/6/17  I have been making this banana bread since 2008 and it is still my favorite and most requested banana bread recipe!  You can't go wrong with this one!

Light, airy, and moist,with a delicious banana, and cinnamon flavor. I've been looking for a banana bread recipe for a long time.  This one is the greatest!
Instead of making into bread, I made it into muffins, regular size muffins, and mini muffins.What a treat!

I have to admit, I thought this was going to be another "banana bread" recipe..hoehum boring but WOW was I surprised! This bread is so moist! I really like the crunchy coating and then the soft center. Great idea to coat the pan with the cinnamon sugar. I am on my second piece already! I omited the nuts but I bet it would be great with pecans!
Happy baking!

I've read the other reviews and had to contribute my $.02.  It is fabulous!  What a delight to eat.  Much more moist than my previously enjoyed Fanny Farmer banana bread recipe and it's even a little less dense in texture.  Sorry Fanny Farmer, this recipe is a keeper!  Thank you allrecipes for this one!

I have made this recipe twice now and I do have to say that it is the best banana bread ever.  I don't think I will ever go back to the usual recipe I had always made in the past. Plus everyone at work just loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Its true, this recipe is awesome.  No modifications necessary, although I did sprinkle some left over cinnamon sugar on top of one of the loaves, which was a tasty addition if you need even more sweetness.

Fantastic banana bread!  I make one often (recipe that I have adapted from my mom to make a bit healthier) and liked the sound of this one as it uses sour cream.  Since it makes so much, I cut the recipe in half and made a few modifications to make a bit healthier as follows (cutting recipe in half): instead of butter used 1/8 c canola oil, 2/3 c unsweetened applesauce, 1 egg and 1 egg white, light sour cream, 4 bananas, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1 1/4 c white flour and 1 cup whole wheat, other ingredients remained the same.  I left out the nuts as we don't like them too much.  I was able to get one large loaf (9x5x3) and 6 muffins (loaf baked for 65 mins then turned off the oven and let sit for 15 mins).  Turned out super moist and I loved the hint of cinnamon.  Thanks for sharing!

Everyone tasting this bread says it is the best banana bread they have ever had.  I agree (sorry Mom).  And, it makes 2 large loaves and 1 tiny loaf so goes a long way and freezes great.  Thank you!

No one made a better Banana Bread than my "Gram" ... until now.  I thought it would be a nice little gift to send home with my guests who were coming for Easter.  I accidently dropped one of the breads as it was coming out of the oven. The loaf cracked so that was my opportunity. I just had to taste it.  Delicious!  The hint of cinnamon was great. The sour cream made it moist.  And, dusting the pan with the sugar/cinnamon just adds to the crust. I will certainly be making this again.  Thanks,Esther, for a wonderful recipe.

FABULOUS!!  I didn't even like banana bread until I tried this recipe.  I can't beleive how moist it is!  I baked it in muffin pans instead of loaf pans.  I used half whole wheat flour and half regular flour and it was wonderful!!!!

This recipe was easy to do!  It made one loaf and an 8X8 pan.  I halved the recipe.  My hubby took the loaf to work with him and everyone raved about how good it was!  He was surprised to find out there was sour cream in it!  I LOVE this recipe and have to make more today for his work!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this bread according to the recipe, no changes at all. However, the bake time seemed quite a bit off to me.  I cooked it for an hour and it still came out super mushy.  If i were to make this again i would turn up the temperature in the oven by a few degrees and keep my fingers crossed that I got a slightly more solid bread.

Wonderful. I halved the recipe. Used plain yogurt instead of sour cream since I didn't have any. Did take a little longer to cook than it says in the recipe, but I use a countertop oven so that could be the reason for me. I also sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top of the bread. . .gave it a nice crunch.

I just made this and it is wonderful!  I've got to admit I was a little leary of the sour cream but it gave the bread a wonderful teaxture and you don't even know it's there.  I cut this recipe in half and it made 1 loaf in a 10 inch loaf pan.  (I didn't use all of the sugar/cinnamon mixture to line the pan though.)  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have been making this bread for a few years. And it really is one of the best ones out there. I use only use 3 bananas, then add 1 cup of drained pineapples, 1/2 cup of drained cherries, 1 cup of coconut, and sometimes even drained peaches in I have them in the fridge. I chop them up. I always use canned fruit. But I bet fresh fruit would be good too. Some people said it wouldn't cook all the way threw. It has happened to me once. Just keep sticking a knife into the center until it comes out clean.  That way you can really get a good look of the inside. It also makes a lot. I like to make small loafs and give them out to everyone.***************

Loved it! I combined SaraLady19's suggestion for the topping with LINDABTX's recommendations for a healthier bread (except using Splenda - I don't like it! ;P), and it was amazing!  Oh, and I also roasted the nuts at 350 for 5-10 min beforehand. I used fat-free sour cream, too, and it was delicious! The bread turned out more like cake! I also halved the recipe. I'd do a couple things differently next time to make it that much better: 
1. Use unsweetened applesauce, used less sugar, or both.  The way I did it, it turned out just a bit too sweet for me. OK with a nice glass of milk, though...mmm!
2. Waited until the bananas were just a titch more ripe.  I think it would have given the loaves that extra oomph of flavor. (I got impatient to try this awesome recipe!)
3. The bottoms of my loaves got a little more moist than the top once it sat on the counter & cooled off.  Maybe that's because I had it cooling on a paper towel on top of the cooling rack. I'll try putting it staight on the rack next time next time. I forgot about adding the wheat flour (from LINDABTX's) until my batter was already in the pans, so I just carefully stirred it in.  That could have done it.
Otherwise, this is, without a doubt my favorite banana bread recipe!

A GREAT banana bread recipe, this will now and forever be my tride and true. The only modification that I made on this one is that used 1 package of instant banana creme  pudding instead of sour cream-- it turned out fabulous! Definitely be sure to make the Brown Sugar topping that was mentioned by another earlier, it makes all the difference.

Oh my gosh. Words cannot describe the deliciousness of this bread. My 16 year old son fell in love with it.
I just made 2 regular loaves instead of 4 small ones and - no joke - I have 1 loaf left. They came out of the oven an hour ago.
Excellent!

Delish delish delish!

Better than the kind that I grew up with (sorry Aunt Nancy).

I loved the slight crunch of the cinnamon sugar on the outside.

Very tasty banana bread - great for a snowy February day!  I'd never had or made banana bread with cinnamon, so wasn't sure how that would taste.  Different, but good! 

For Sanetha D.......

You probably chose to decrease the amount of the recipe by half, which is why 3 Cups of sugar is referred to in the directions and 1.5 Cups sugar is in the ingredient list.  I've noticed that only the ingredients are affected when you change the serving size of recipes, not the amounts in the directions.

This is the best banana bread ever, even my fussy 26yr old "i dont like anything" daughter loves it! I always substitute half the sugar for apple sauce, so i add about a cup & a half of apple sauce & depending on how mushy the bananas are i sometimes have to add some more flour so its not so runny. I also add crushed walnuts. This is a hit everywhere i take it.

This is the best banana bread I have ever tasted.  I quartered the recipe the first time I made it so I had just one loaf, and it was gone within minutes.  I already went back to the store for the ingredients to make more.  This stuff is addicting!

I made this bread last night.  Was good but I wouldn't say 5 star.  A bit on the sweet side and very moist - more cake like.  I may try again.  Will add more cinnamon next time.  Got 4 loaves and also 10 muffins.

I am always looking for that "magical" banana bread recipe so I decided to try this one after reading all the good reviews.  This definitely was a good banana bread, but to me, they all taste the same.  I try tons of recipes, but banana bread is banana bread.  I definitely would make this again, but would also try others.

I can't believe how well these turned out!  I was surprised at how many muffins I got - 32 big ones!  I added a bag of milk chocolate chips to them and everyone in the house gobbled them up.  Absolutely delicious, I will make this again and again and again!

This was my first time making banana bread and this recipe is amazing!!  I only made 1/2 and I had a huge loaf and a half dozen muffins.  I did add the walnuts- next time I might try chocolate chips.  Thank you for the great recipe!

This is my absolute favorite banana bread recipe ever.  Moist and sweet and just plain delicious.  I usually make three loaves:  one without the cinnamon, one with cinnamon and one with cinnamon and chocolate chips.  The kids love them all and couldn't say which is their favorite.  They disappear very quickly!

I have tried more banana bread recipes than I could ever count, all failures. This was a huge success! My friends and family absolutely loved it! I love that it takes few ingredients and makes 4 loaves.  I gave them away at Christmas. I did not have 7x3 pans, but it turned out well in the larger loaf pans. The only change I made was adding slightly more cinnamon. I'm going to half the recipe right now and make some muffins with a crumb topping. I was sceptical of adding sour cream, afraid that it would give it "bite", but please do not hesitate, it does not take away from the banana taste one bit.  This is definately a great recipe with so many options of things to add to make each time a little different.  Thank you for finally giving me a banana bread recipe that I can bake!

thanks to previous reviewers, I made a few revisions that enhanced this bread.  It is really moist and tender because of the sour cream, so I split the recipe between 2 bundt pans to reduce the weight and cooking time.  I used olive oil instead of butter, used white whole wheat flour, and used splenda in the cake itself.  I also added an 8oz bag of dark chocolate chips.   The cinnamon sugar really adds to the rich appearance and taste.  This is a winner.

This bread was so moist & delicious.  I got so many requests for the recipe.  It does make quite a bit as well.  Great for Holiday gifts, I made 3 large loaves and 4 small loaves.

Very good! Moist, easy to make. The cinnamon sugar pan dusting makes a really nice sweet crust. Have to cut big slices because it is a little crumbly & fell apart when I sliced it thin, but the taste is worth it!

Very good recipe!  My daughter loves banana bread and wanted me to make my old standby recipe....We have a new standyby.  This was not too sweet and the sour cream in place of the butter was great!

I ended up cutting this recipe in half, and poured all of the batter into a regular size loaf pan.  The bread didn't turn out that moist, but quite possibly it was because of the pan I put it in.  It had a different flavor, but I can't say it's the best banana bread I've ever had or made.

I had some brown bananas and thought I'd look for a new recipe rather than my tried and true banana bread and I am so glad I did!  This bread is so flavorful and moist!  The friends I gave a loaf to said it was hands down the best banana bread they've ever had.  Thanks for my new "tried and true" banana bread recipe!  (I did use pecans instead of walnuts due to personal preference, but everything else was exactly as written)

This is the only banana bread I will eat. Everyone loves it! It easy to make and fool proof. The cinnamon and sugar coating gives it a little crunchy coating. Make it and freeze 2 of the loaves. Thank you for the recipe.

I've made this twice and everyone says it's the best banana bread they've ever tasted.  I divide the batter so that I  can make 3 loaves with pecans (better than walnuts, I think) and 1 loaf with chocolate chips for my son.  Terrific and moist either way.

I made several loaves of bread for friends and family as gifts this year.  This bread came out beautiful.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to sample any but everyone who received one loved it.

Most Excellent!!!  I ended halving the recipe because I only have two loaf pans, but otherwise I followed the recipe to a tee and the bread came out perfect!  I might have to buy a couple more pans for the next time I make this - I would love to bring a loaf to work, and maybe put some up in the freezer for later.....

This was VERY GOOD!  I cut the recipe down to a third and it was the perfect amount for making one 9x5 bread loaf.  It was very moist and easy to make, the cinnamon sugar coating on the pan was a really nice touch.  Next time I may add a little more banana and spice for a stronger flavor, maybe chocolate chips too!  Definitely a keeper though, just needs to be adjusted for personal tastes.

The best banana bread I've ever had or made. I've tried about 15 recipes so far but I'm done now. I have found the winner. This recipe is excellent as is with the addition of nutmeg and cloves (and the guilty pleasure of chocolate chips, once in a while). 
I have never used a topping but tried the brown sugar/butter/flour/cinnamon topping recommended by a reviewer and I am converted. Excellent. I fell asleep with a loaf in the oven and it was still good after cooking for 2 hours. The topping carmelized and kept everything moist. Have I mentioned yet how much I love this recipe, lol?

Seriously wonderful! Lost my recipe I had for many years. Tried this one because I had extra sour cream on hand. I added and additional 1/2 cup of flour and did not put the cinnamon in the batter. Loved the tangy addition of the sour cream. Even if I find the old recipe, I will be using this one instead.

I’ve made banana bread at least a hundred times with several different recipes.  I made this one tonight and it was absolutely the very best!  The cinnamon you dust the pan with and the sour cream make it amazing!  I froze the extra loaves.

This is the best banana bread I have ever had.  I prefer it without nuts and extra cinnamon, and I usually double coat the pan with cinnamon sugar as well.  The texture is perfect, and it freezes very well.

Excellent!   I cooked mine for about an hour at 325 and they turned out great.  Maybe a tad too sweet, so next time I might cut out 1/2 c sugar or more.

This is absolutely the best banana bread recipe you will find! WARNING: This makes a LOT of bread...I have the 4-loaf mini pans and it made eight of them. One of the best things to do is once you butter the bread pan, just take regular cinnamon sugar to sprinkle all over. It creates this yummy sweet crunchiness on the outer layer of the bread. This bread also freezes really well, just thaw in the refrigerator for a day or so. Thank you for the great recipe!

We thought this was an excellent recipe.
The bread was moist and flavorful.  We
especially enjoy it with morning coffee.
Thanks for posting!

Yummy!  I didn't have 4 loaf pans, so I opted to half the recipe.  The bananas I had were on the small side, so I used 4 in the recipe.  It turned out wonderful.  Moist, but not too moist that it fell apart.  I really liked the sugar mixture on the outside of the loaves.  I also really like nutmeg, so I added some to the batter.  I will definately make this one again.

YUUUUUMMMMMYYYY! Wow, this recipe is so much tastier then the one I usually make. I followed the recipe exact except I didn't add walnuts because I was out and I also followed a suggestion from another review. I baked the banana bread for 1 hr and 10 minutes at 325 and it turn out great. I will for sure be making this in the near future

Tried this recipe and loved the flavor and moistness. I followed the other viewers advice with the changes. The only thing I didn't like about it was after it was baked it felt wet around the outside and I didn't let it sit in the pan very long before I took it out to cool. Even after it cooled and I wrapped it, it still felt wet on the outside. My husband is a picky eater and doesn't care for sweets like I do, but he liked this one and wanted to take a loaf to work to share. Even though this was very good in flavor I don't know if I will make it again untill I can figure out how to get rid of the wetness around the outside. It doesn't make for a very attractive gift when you unwrap it and half the sides peel off. I love to bake but I haven't learned all the tricks of the trade, so I need everything written down and detailed instructions. I'm not a "Fly by the seat of my pants gal." (as Julia Roberts would say) I'm still giving it 5 stars because the flavor and moistness was great and everybody that sampled it wanted the recipe. Maybe they will have better luck than me with the outside.

This recipe is the most amazing banana bread recipe that I have tasted. The end product was so moist and flavorful that to all that tried it was so impressed that I will be making more this coming week. I used larger loaf pans so I actually devided the batter into three pans. The end result was nothing less than perfection!!

I cannot even begin to describe how good this banana bread is.  I LOVE banana bread, but whenever I tried to make it, it always turned out mushy and flavorless.  But this recipe gave me the BEST banana bread EVER!!!!!  I followed this recipe perfectly (I did hand-mix dry and wet ingredients as per other reviewers) and I will be making this over and over.

The recipe promised to be "a little bit different" and it is. Just enough so that it's now our 'offical' banana bread. Nice work!

This is a very good recipe! Good way to use those overripe bananas.. The sour cream gives it that extra punch!  Thanks for the post! Note my pans were bigger than the ones called for but just added some time on the baking and they came out fine!

Love it Love it Love it! I have found I prefer to bake at 325 degrees or its kind of wet in the middle. I use 1 9x5 bread pan and a 10x15 metal pan. I like to sprinkle the cinnamon sugar on the bread and not the pan, because it seems like the sugar cements the bread to the pan. I also like to spoon the flour into the measuring cups after i stir it a bit, so it's not so heavy. I also like to add 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. Sooooo yummy.

I've made many variations of banana bread and tried different recipes, and I must say that this is the best banana bread I've ever had! The sour cream keeps it moist and the cinnamon adds a little something that makes it great! It pleased even the pickiest of eaters!

This is the best banana bread I've ever had! I first made it exactly as the recipe states, but the second time, I used applesauce instead of butter, used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all purpose flour, 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 sugar. It was great both ways!

I have been using the same banana bread recipe for 10 years up until now. I am converted! This recipe rose very well in the pan and was level and moist, not a hump with a crack down the middle like I usually get! Love the sugar and cinnamon on the outside crust too. It is just so moist and flavorful. It has become a frequent request of my husband's now.

Very good. Made 4 loaves. Very moist and a lot of banana flavor. When my bananas start going bad I freeze them. Loved the sugar and cinnamon coating.

This bread turned out great!  It was moist, flavorful and just as easy as any other recipe I have tried.  The cinnamon sugar you coat the baking pan with really makes it great, and a little different.  I babysit for a 4 year old and a 6 year old and they went nuts over it.  I did cut the recipe in half and still had a ton.  I followed someone else's suggestion with half the recipe and used 2 eggs (instead of 1 1/2) and 4 bananas (instead of 3).  I think this helped make the bread more moist and have a better consistency.  I also divided up the batter into 5 mini loaf pans and baked them together for about 40 minutes.  Great for sharing!

My new favorite banana bread recipe! My old recipe used plain yogurt, which I don't have on hand, always had to buy special to make banana bread. I also experimented using Splenda Blend for Baking, turned out great. Not too moist, not too dry. Left out walnuts, my husband hates them. Scaled the recipe down to match the 4 VERY overripe bananas I had, and baked in 5 mini-loaf pans for almost an hour.

The best bread I've eaten, and I'm not really a big banana fan. It's even better when you slice & toast it the following day.  Something in the bread crystalizes (banana? sugar?) and gives the bread a nice crunch. Even the serious bakers in my family have requested this recipe. Yum, yum, yum!

I thought the banana bread itself was excellent.  I will definitely use this recipe again and again... but I would omit dusting the pan with sugar mixture.  I found it made it too sweet and detracted from the banana flavour of the bread.  As well, I used the crumb topping that was suggested by other reviewers and again it was just too over the top.  Banana bread in its simplest form is the best and does not need any embellishing. (maybe some chocolate chips for the kiddies, though!)

This is the BEST!  I won the blue ribbon in a competition with this amazing recipe :) I always generously top the breads with the cinnamon and sugar, use a little less butter and atleast one extra banana.  Always a big hit and truly a hard recipe to mess up.

This is the best banana bread I have ever made! I cut the recipe in half, used two full eggs like other suggestions, but used 5 bananas, just because we like extra, and it turned out just fine!

The best banana bread I've ever tasted--perhaps it's the sour cream, or the crispy cinnamon-sugar coating on the crust, but it's fantastic.

I gave this a four star rating only because i had a little problem with the outside of the loaves browning a little too much in order to fully cook the inside. But since noone else seemed to have complaints about this maybe it is just the oven i used. The middle pieces however were delicious. Very moist and flavorful. I added a struesel topping to two of the loaves before baking and those came out amazing! Would definetly recommend this recipe.

I've searched many years for better banana bread recipes.  This is it!  The carmelized sugar is the secret. I even messed up and didn't bake it long enough the first time....The family still fought over the remnants! WARNING:  Making this bread will give you the desire to eat the whole loaf yourself!

Sooo Yummy!! Not at all too sweet and so very very moist...I halved the recipe and used light butter and light sour cream - ended up with 4 mini loaves which is perfect for us and you'd never know I used the less fat version of some ingredients.
Thanks for the recipe, a definite keeper!

This is the best banana bread I've ever made!  I didn't have to make any changes, just left out the nuts.  The sugar & cinnamon coating on the crust adds a delicious touch.  Make extra because you'll eat way too much!!!

The first loaf was gone within 24 hrs. and it was only me and my husband eating eat. It is soooo delicious! I did half the recipe, and I definitely could have used 4 bananas instead of 3. I can't make this too often though with all the sugar!

This banana bread was AWESOME - I have to split the batch each time because my husband can't have walnuts.  So, instead, I substituted walnuts for chocolate chips and he also loved it!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Very good recipe.  The bread is sweet and moist with good flavor.  Right out of the oven, the bread has a nice crunchy top, but it softens later.  I prefer nuttier banana bread, so next time I might increase the amout of walnuts.  The recipe makes a LOT of batter.

I cut the recipe in half and didn't use cinnamon (personal preference).  The end result was very, very good.  Moist and filling!  I agree with other folks when they say this bread is REALLY sweet - next time I make this, I will definitely reduce the sugar.

Very good recipe - but the batter was too much for my slightly smaller 6x3 mini loaf pans.   I cut the recipe by 1/3 and had the correct amount.  Also - I use a convection oven and it came out perfect after 45 minutes @ 300 degrees.

I made this for a party and EVERYBODY loved it!  Said it was the best banana bread they ever had and wanted the recipe.  They could not get enough.  The cinnamon and sugar crust was a bit hit.  Very moist and delicious.  Absolutly will be making this banana bread again and again!!

Really yummy banana bread. I was a little worried about using sour cream in banana bread but I found this to be really really good.

This was absolutely delicious. I'm diabetic, so I replaced Splenda for the sugar measure-for-measure. (I used a scaled-down recipe and made one loaf instead of 4.)

To make it lower-glycemic, I replaced 1/2 the flour with whole wheat flour, and 1/4 of the flour with vanilla whey protein powder. The other 1/4 I used white flour. (If you're used to substituting some flour in your breads with vanilla pudding, this has the same effect.)

I've missed banana bread, and now I can have it again! I'm keeping this recipe for sure.

WE HAVE A WINNER!!!! I've been trying to find a recipe that my husband likes for 4 years. This one did it! The only thing I changed was to leave off the cinnamon sugar sprinkle on the sides. This bread is perfectly sweet on it's own. If I try it with the sprinkles I will most likely cut down on the sugar in the recipe a little. I've used fat free plain yogurt when I'm out of sour cream and no one can tell a difference. I recently made a bundt loaf for my physician's office. Now I'm known as the "banana bread lady" and I'm jokingly told I can only make an appointment if I bring more bread!

I thought this was good, I used all whole wheat flower, but I was dissapointed how the cinnamon dusting left the edges taste a little burned.

I work with a lot of accomplished chefs, so praise is difficult to gain. This recipe received RAVES (I kid you not) about how moist and flavourful it was. 
I printed out this recipe 8 times. It really is the best banana bread recipe. Ever.  

PS-- I did not change a thing.

I love this recipe. I had to add a little milk to it, because the dough was a little too "tough" but I think that is because the sour cream is different in Australia when compared to America. I took it to a class I was having and shared with with 50 Australians. THEY LOVED IT!!!

WOW! This is an awesome recipe! I wanted muffins instead of loaves so I reduced the serving size to 11 and it made 18 muffins. I sprinkled the cinnamon and sugar on the bottom of the muffin paper cup and half filled with my batter. I wanted a really pretty topping on the top of my muffins so I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 tbsp. of melted butter and added some walnuts to that. I added that mixture to the top of the batter and baked them. Oh my! I couldnt stop at just eating one, especially while they were hot! A must try! Turned out very pretty to even give as gifts!

This banana bread is fantastic! I have made it with several variations on the basic recipe and it turned out brilliantly everytime. I cut the sugar down (especially if the bananas I am using are very ripe) and omit the nuts, in place of the nuts I have used choc chips (very yummy, but very sweet) or frozen mixed winter berries (this is my favourite variation, the slight sourness of the rasberrys and blueberries really cuts through the sweetness of the bread and the berries go all soft and gooey). In fact, I am making it for the second time in three days to take to work for morning tea! Fabulous.

Wow, what a moist and delicious banana bread. This will replace my standard bb recipe from now on. I did have to make some changes/substitutions. For one, I used two standard bread pans and had to bake for an additional 30 minutes. I also didn't have 16 oz of sour cream, so I made up the difference, about a third, with lowfat plain yogurt, and it was still great. I also used light sour cream, and the loaf is still rich and yummy.

Everyone loves this recipe! I followed others recommendation of using only 2.5 cup of sugar. Perfect! I made one in a bundt pan and three 3 x 7 loaves. Also, I just left it in the oven for 1.5hrs at 300 degree.

this banana bread is my favorite! I've made it 3 times now. I usually halve it and it's still really great. I don't do the cinnamon and sugar as the crust, because it doesn't sound good to me. Like others reccomend, I use half brown sugar and half white, and I usually add a few more bananas. 

This is moist and very flavorful! I very much reccomend it!

I've made many many banana bread recipes and this one is without doubt the best I've ever made.  I didn't dust the pans with the sugar and cinnamon, but I did add about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, semi-sweet and received many raves.  Made 7 mini loaves and gave some for Christmas gifts.  Have made twice and will defiently always have some in my freezer for unexpected guests and just for dessert.

I've made this a few times and finally got brave enough to modify the heck out of it.  I used 1/4 c butter and the rest in baby food prunes.  1.5 cups of brown sugar, 1 egg and 1/2 cup of egg whites.  I also used whole wheat flour and apple yogurt instead of sour cream.  I have to admit it turned out pretty good.  I think it needs to be played with a bit more though.  But pretty good for healthier muffins.  This recipe turned out great.  I halved it and baked it in an 8by8 pan.  I needed to cook it for an extra 15 mins due to the pan size.  I also used a mix of yogurt and sour cream b/c it was what I had on hand.

Delicious!!
I followed the recipe exact, without the nuts. I did add chocolate chips to half the batter. Boy was that a great idea! I wish I put them in the whole thing. Next time I may put dried apples or some chopped stawberries to see how it goes. mmmmm!

Gave four stars cause I'm new to baking and it was a lot of work. Tastes great, though. Beginners, BEWARE: this recipe makes enough to feed the entire neighborhood! I split the batter in half and added nuts to one and chocolate chips to the other. (Kids are allergic to nuts)

If I could give it 10 stars, I would!  So delicious and moist- I followed the directions exactly except that I baked them at 325 for an hour and they were done perfectly.  Thank you for the recipe!

Okay, you could not get me to eat a banana, it's just not a favorite of mine. I made this recipe because I had alot of banana's and no one seem to be eating them. I made three breads and ten muffins and they came out wonderfully. I tasted a slice and couldn't believe how good it was, very moist and the cinnamon on the bottom added great flavor. My husband took one to work and everyone loved it. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

This recipe was sooooo.... good.  This is my first review because we all loved it.  I made two bigger loaves with it since I didn't have the smaller pans and then made the extra into muffins.  It made awesome muffins.  I just sprinkled some of the cinnamon/sugar into the bottom and poured the batter in. I love the cinnamon/sugar crust.  Yum!

I had about 20 reviews on the bread and everyone absolutely loved it.   I did make it without the walnuts because I'm not a fan of them but everyone still love the bread.

I decreased the amount of sugar as others suggested. Especially loved the cinnamon-sugar coating -- gives it a little extra crunch and zip. Moist and delicious. Thank you!

Wow. I have always used my grandma's banana bread recipe, but I had a bunch of sour cream I bought on sale and lots of overripe bananas taking up space in my freezer, so I decided to give this recipe a try.

It's better than my grandma's recipe, and I didn't think that was possible. Fabulous flavor and so easy to make. The whole family loves it.

Loved this receipe.  It was the first thing to go at our Thanksgiving meal.  Beautiful presentation and ultra moist.  Only substitution I made was pecans instead of walnuts.  Walnuts are to bitter for me and pecans have the perfect flavor to compliment this bread.  Thank you.... Thank you....

If you don't have favorite banana bread recipe, this is it. The moistness doesn't leave after being frozen and you still have all that great aroma.  I have tried many recipes for banana bread but this one by far is THE BEST!!!  Thanks for passing along the recipe.

Here's the verdict on this Banana Sour Cream Bread.  This bread was apart of our Thanksgiving meal.  The Bread was very moist, but firm and hearty with execellent flavor.  The butter with the cinnamon and sugar that was dusted on the pan prior to baking assisted in just enough added sweetness, flavor and a little crunch while having a slice with your favorite coffee or latte. I am making more this week.

This came out too sweet.  I would use less sugar next time.  The cinnamon/sugar on the bottom of the pan is completely unnecessary, will omit next time.  The  banana bread came out pretty good.  I used to have a better recipe, a little more moist, but I lost it.  This one is not bad.

Very moist and tasty banana bread. My family really liked it and I will be making it again. I did have to cook it about 15 minutes longer than stated. Use a toothpick to test the center, if it comes out clean, it's done. Thanks for submitting.

This recipe is the  absolute best. My family all agrees it is better than my former favorite banana bread recipe. It is very moist and tasty. I used Crisco instead of the butter and light sour cream...so; had I used butter and regular sour cream, it would only have made it richer and better! Thanks so much; this is a fantastic classic :)

Absolutly the best Banana bread you could make for yourself and your friends!!  It makes a big enough batch for you to make a loaf for yourself and a couple to give away to others (make sure you treat yourself with your own loaf...it's really just that good!)Also I made my last batch (I make it once a month now) with one less banana for my b/f who hates banana anything and he loved the bread.

With the number of loaves that this recipe makes, I always share with family and friends. Needless to say, I'm often asked when I'll be making it again. The cinnamon and sugar glaze makes this heavenly treat a tea time favourite!

Absolutely yummy! Going to make this a lot. I think I may cut back on the sugar amount to 2.5 cups next time. I could not find the 7x3 loave pans anywhere, so used slighlty bigger pans.Thanks for a great recipe.

This was a very good recipe.  I only had 2 eggs instead of 3, and I used (3) 8x4 loaf pans instead of (4) 7x3.  I also omitted the nuts due to allergies.  I also baked it for about 1 hr 30 min on 300.   They turned out so TASTY!  I have found a new Banana Bread recipe!  THANKS!

Absolutely one of the BEST banana breads I have ever made!  The inclusion of sour cream, cinnamon, and vanilla make this bread a moist and delicious standout.  I had just two ripe bananas on hand, so used one third of the ingredient amounts, and baked it in one 8½ X 4½ loaf pan.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I made this for my aunt and her family when they invited us to supper, and it was a huge hit. Without a doubt, it is the best banana bread I've ever made, and I've tried quite a few recipes. Her husband is kind of picky, and he absolutely loved it. I love that it makes a huge batch---I can freeze it or share it, though it is hard to share. :) Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

I believe this is one the website's first recipes when I first logged on years ago-I only just joined recently.  Bottomline:  Ms. Esther Nelson is the Queen of Banana Bread-she could have gotten rich off this recipe.  Glad you shared it!

I have made this banana bread recipe probably a dozen times since I have discovered it. I play with the ingredients (different nuts, adding more bananas etc..)and it is perfect everytime. I love the cinammon sugar "crust", noone seems to mind eating the ends now....

This is the BEST banana bread recipe I have ever tried!  I topped the loaves with a sprinkle of brown sugar, flax seed and almonds before baking.  It makes a nice crunchy top.  YUM!

I used brown sugar and all whole wheat flour with a bit of flax seed meal and wheat gluten added.  The flavor was fantastic, and the texture was marvelous!  Everyone LOVED it!

This is by far the best banana bread ever. I always used the banana banana bread recipe on this site which I thought was really good, but this one is much better its moist and dense. My husband and kids agreed I will never make any other banana bread again. I followed recipe but i used a bunt pan and a loaf pan. had to cook a little longer than a hour. By far the BEST

How do I do justice to this recipe? I made it as an after-thought for Thanksgiving dinner since I had some old bananas to get rid of. It was very easy to prepare and I love the cinnamon/sugar dusting. Everyone loved this bread. My 19 year old son ate it for dessert instead of pie. My niece who is a diet/nutition major in college couldn't believe there was sourcream in it. I imiagine it would freeze well but we ate all four loaves over 2 meals. This has definitely become a thanksgiving tradition for us and a new family favorite, Thanks Esther-it is great!

This recipe was a hit!  I finished baking it less than 24 hours ago and its almost completely gone.  I just want to know how it would turn out if I added less sugar, say, half a cup less.  Any thoughts?

So if you're looking for something a little different from the regular banana bread of your youth.  This is it.  It's just fine.  I like the dense, strong banana flavor like babana bread my gramps and my mom used to make...and this was not it.  It's too fluffy for me to love.  Not enough banana flavor for me to think it tastes like banana bread... very cinnamon-y... but it will be good with coffee because it is very much like coffee cake with a hint of banana.

This is really great banana bread. I halved the recipe and it turned out great. I substituted splenda for 1/2 cup of the sugar and only used 1/2 cup butter. I added an extra banana and a tbsp of extra sour cream (I used light sour cream) to increase moistness due to cutting the butter down. It turned out amazing!! Also, in one of my loaves, I threw in a handful of chopped dates and a handful of unsweetened coconut flakes - this made it even better. I'll use this recipe again - thanks!!

I'm new to making bread.  I tried two other banana bread recipies and they both got mixed feelings.  This one, however, received rave reviews from family and friends.  I don't think I'll ever try another recipe for this again.

Although I only had 4 bananas and used reduced-fat sour cream, this recipe turned out moist and delicious.  And the reduced oven temperature prevented any burning along the edges. I also used black walnuts, which made the bread extra yummy.  This is definitely a keeper!

This is by far the best banana bread recipe I have ever used or tasted. We like to eat it quickly because if we wrap it the crisp sugar topping will get soft. I will probably never use another recipe and I certainly won't recommend any others.

I usually make a different recipe, but tried this one and my family loved it.  My husband said it was better than the usual one I make.  I use a mini loaf pan, which makes cute little loaves.  I used low fat sourcream, I Can't Believe it's Not Butter sticks and I mixed 2 1/4 cups each of white flour and whole wheat flour.  Came out really moist and yummy.  Only had 5 bananas, but it still had good banana flavor.  Thanks!

Unbelievable! This is the #1 absolute BEST banana bred ever! I got this recipie over a year ago and have not stopped making it. I have a big family and this makes 4 perfectly sized loaves so some I give away and some I freeze. The only bad thing about this is having to wait for your bananas to ripen so you can make it again!

Most Excellent!  One of the best banana bread recipes I've made!  Very moist and addicting!  Great way to use overripe bananas! Made 1/2 of the recipe. Topped one loaf with chopped walnuts, cinnamon sugar, and some coconut - delish!  My friends are asking for the recipe and my family wants more!  Thanks for sharing!

300 degrees for an hour did not work: kept them in at 350 for an additional 15 minutes and then they were fine-curious if others had this experience-what other combos of time and temp worked?

This is the BEST banana bread recipe I've tried on this site.  The flavor and texture is just heavenly!  I followed (half) the recipe exactly and used a bundt pan (baked for 70 mins).  It just turned out excellent!  YUM, is all I can say.  Thanks for the recipe, Esther.

This is by far and away, the moistest, most delicious banana bread I've ever tasted! It's easy to make and when finished is a lovely golden brown color, I'm sure, due to the slow baking process. I'll never go back to my old recipe.

Made this recipe when I way too many ripe bananas and an extra tub of sour cream after Thanksgiving.  Didn't have enough loaves pans to accommodate the amount of batter but substituted a bundt pan.  A low temperature is a must with this recipe. Didn't have nuts in the cupboard but recipe was fine without.  Brought it in to share with co-workers the next day and it was gone by noon. Would be great recipe to produce mini-loaves for gift giving. Happy baking!

the best recipe of its kind and believe me, i've tried them all. scaled it to 11 servings (wanted to use only 1 egg), left out the nuts. used 4 med size bananas. 350 deg for 75 mins in a standard loaf pan. so, so good, really rises well. a keeper!

I make this recipe all the time for friends and gatherings.  It's everyone's favorite!  I generally use a teensy bit less flour - too much flour will dry it out and it will taste like every other banana bread out there.  Also, I like to go heavy on the cinnamon and sugar mix in the pan.  One time I made the mistake of getting the cinnamon and sugar mixture a bit wet so that it clumped.  I still dusted the pan with it, though it was obviously clumped in spots.  To my surprise, it was extra good that time!  I will do that again next time on purpose.

This is my favorite banana bread recipe. I have given it out many times. I throw my bananas in the freezer until I have enough to make two loafs and the kids eat one before any one else gets any!

This is the best banana bread that I have ever made and tasted.  It is just so moist and flavorful.  I have had nothing but raving compliments on this bread.  I have made several versions of banana bread including a couple in James Beard's cookbook and nothing has come close.  The sugar and cinnamon on the outer crust makes it very unique and scrumptous.  Thank you.

I MADE THIS FOR MY FAMILY TO USE UP SOME OVER RIPE BANANAS. MY HUSBAND TOOK SOME IN HIS LUNCH AND HIS COWORKER WANTED  TO KNOW IF WE HAD ANY MORE. SERVED IT TO FAMILY THAT WAS IN FROM OUT OF TOWNA ND HAD TO MAKE COPIES OF THE RECIPE FOR THEM TO TAKE BACK TO MAKE AT HOME. ONLY THING I DID DIFFERENT IS I USED PECANS RATHER THAN WALNUTS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I HAD. THEY LOVE IT. THANKS.

This is now my staple banana bread recipe. I love any bread recipe that includes sour cream or instant pudding, you can't go wrong. I usually cut it in half, as it's pretty fattening and my husband and I would eat all four loaves if I made them.

This is one of the best banana bread recipes I have ever tried.  I always receive compliments and requests for the recipe.  It freezes well, and I often make it for gift-giving.  I sprinkle the top with cinnamon sugar, as well as the pans.

This bread was fantastic!  I made this into a fluted stoneware cake pan (had to alter cooking time to almost 3 hours).  It smells wonderful when cooking and the outside was semi-crunchy (I used brown sugar, white sugar and cinnamon) and the inside was moist!  I couldn't wait to taste it so I cut into it as soon as it came out of the oven.  A HUGE hit at work the next morning.

I halfed the recipe and used 4 mini loaf pans instead. I still baked them at 300 for an hour. They turned out great. My 2 year old loved it. You'd never know sour cream was the secret  ingredient. This ones a keeper!

The bread came out great, very moist. I made it exactly like the recipe called for. Not having 7x3 pans though I used 2 10x5 pans and still had enough batter for three large muffin jimmies. I had to adjust the cooking time to 90min with the big pans.

Very nice bread.  I especially liked the cinnamon sugar crust.  I think I might increase the heat slightly when I bake it next as it did appear a bit pale.

I love Banana Nut Bread but this was actually my first time making it. This was absolutely the best I have ever had. It was so good even my 3 year old son loves it; and that's saying a lot. I did substitute the all purpose flour with bread flour but this recipe needs no alteration. Thank you Esther for this wonderful recipe.

Excellent flavor!  I was in a hurry, and didn't have over-ripe bananas, so I had to use regular bananas.  Still turned out great!  1 batch made 8 mini loaves - filled nearly 3/4 full and they rose perfectly to make nice shaped loaves.  Will wrap and give out to neighbors for Christmas.  Thank you!

This was the first time to try this recipe, I got started and realized I only had half a tub of sour cream so I added about 3/4 cup of heavy cream.  I don't know if that made a huge difference but the bread was amazing, almost cakelike.  Will definitely make again, did have to increase bake time about 15 minutes.  Thank You for the wonderful recipe!

I have been searching for the perfect banana bread recipe for quite some time now...and I think I just found it!!  This banana bread was amazing..it was so moist and tasty.  I dont really like cinnamon, so I did not make the cinnamon/sugar coating, and I also didnt add cinnamon into the bread, and it turned out great!  The only thing I would try the next time, is add an extra banana or two.
Thank you for the great recipe.  (I have already bought more bananas to make more this weekend!!)

AWESOME!  My husband rated this as "positively, absolutely the best banana bread he's ever had".  I took a loaf to the guys at work and it was devoured in no time.

I haven't had the chance to even make this yet, but I tried it at a friend's place today, and it was amazing.  She cut back a bit on the recipe, used half yogurt, and pecans instead of walnuts and baked it in a Bundt pan.  It just melter in our mouths.  Good competition for my own recipe, and I plan on making it tomorrow!!!

Hands down, best banana bread ever!!!  I made this for Mother's Day brunch and it was soooo good!  I tried the Banana Banana Bread recipe on this site last week and threw it out because it was so bad.  I was so pleased at how moist and flavorful this bread turned out.  Everyone loved it!  I will definitely make this one again.

I added a full bag of chocolate chips, and baked in my mini loaf pan - the recipe with no other modifications made 10 mini loaves! This recipe was awesome, heard nothing but raves about it from my fiance, who is VERY picky and critical!

Each Christmas, we give away Christmas Cookies. Last year we made over 240 dozen. The centerpiece of our trays was a small loaf of this banana bread. It was absolutely super! This IS the best banana bread we've ever tasted!

My kids loved this bread.  Usually they don't care much for banana bread if it doesn't have chocolat chips in it. I left them out of this one and they still both ate  2 big slices as soon as it came out of the oven.  It is great bread.  I will definitly make it again.

DISSAPOINTED...I was looking for a good banana bread recipe, this was more like cake.  Extremely sweet, and not much banana flavor.  However may not make a bad cake.

This banana bread was very moist but a little sweet.  I'm sure our golden retriever would give it 5 stars, as she did manage to hop up to the countertop and pull down 3/4 of the loaf, and eat it all in one sitting!  An overall good recipe.  Thanks.  Angela

This is easy and oh, so delicious!  I replaced some of the butter with 1 extra banana and used light sour cream.  Because I was baking it in the evening, when it was almost finished baking, I turned off the oven and let it stay in there overnight.  In the morning, it was perfect and delicious!

What a fantastic banana bread! My husband wanted to use up some leftover sour cream and so took to the net. He came up with this gem and he baked it up into 4 loaves. Absolutely amazing! It was slightly crunchy on the outside due to the cinnamon/sugar blend, and was perfect with a hot cup of tea. I have passed this recipe around to numerous other people. Thanks for the best banana bread recipe I've ever had the pleasure of trying.

Excellent!  Very moist.  Even my mom who doesn't like banana bread loved it.  I put extra cinnamon and sugar on the pan for more flavor.  We gave these our for Christmas and got rave reviews.  Thanks!

I agree - this is such a wonderful recipe!  I couldn't find the right size pans, so I used 8" x 4", and they turned out just fine.  I did have to bake them a few minutes longer than suggested, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I couldn't believe how moist this was, and I can't wait to share them with family this Christmas.  This is definitely a five star recipe!!!

This was fabulous! I knocked it down to make 2 loaves, and added milk chocolate chips - gave them to 2 people as thank you gifts, and they were VERY well received. I have been spolled by an Amish Cinnamon Bread recipe (the kind you pass a bag of batter and a recipe copy around as a friendhip bread) - I thought that was the most moist bread I'd ever found - it's been replaced, and this is SO simple!!

This is the most amazing recipe for banana bread. A few things make it exceptional: 1) the sour cream makes it super moist  2) dusting the pan with cinnamon-sugar provides a nice crispy top 3) putting cinnamon in the batter compliments the banana quite nicely. This is wonderful comfort food in such unsettling times. I only had 9 bananas so I reduced the amount of sour cream to 12 oz. and cut out a cup of flour and it came out wonderfully! It took about a half an hour longer to bake than the recipe indicated, however.

I absolutely love this receipe! I have made a few changes that may be helpful to others : I droped the 3cups of sugar to 1 1/2 cups and I used "No fat" sour cream .As long as you use VERY ripe bananas ,it still tastes wonderful and is very moist. I have tried putting chocolate chunks in it as well and it was yummy!

You won't be disapointed with this one. Even my picky boyfriend who hates anything banana gobbled it up. The sour cream really does the trick. The whole office and family gives it "6 STARS"!

There's a reason this recipe has close to 100 reviews...IT'S TERRIFIC! Not only is it yummy it's also very versatile. I added about 1T of milk and a bit of nutmeg to the base and then made one batch with milk chocolate chips and another with shredded apple. My boyfriend took them to work and reported back that "Of all the banana breads I made for them this was the biggest hit and people wanted the recipe."  We both agreed that the combo of chocolate chips and banana bread sounded a bit strange but I decided to give it a try since there were a few of you who added them to your breads.  Too bad we both declined trying the batch with the chocolate chips because that was the one that was devoured the quickest! Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe...I will never be forced to throw out old bananas or unused sour cream again! :)

This bread is fabulous!  To quote my mother-in-law "it's the very best banana bread I've ever had."  Quite a compliment from a very experienced baker.  The recipe makes a lot, but it's fun to share the loaves or freeze them for later.

This is a great recipe.  It is totally delicious and very kid friendly.  My only problem is that it makes such a large batch that for everyday use I would probably cut it in half.  I made 1 loaf and muffins that were totally wonderful and my family loved them.

This is the BEST banana bread I have EVER fixed.  It is particularly good out of the oven when the cinnamon mix is crunchy but as the days go on, the topping becomes moist and is even better!!  A recipe that will become a keeper for me.

Great recipe, but I used 3 regular size loaf pans since I did not have 7" x 2" loaf pans

A very rich,(not too rich) dense loaf. I really liked the idea of dusting the pans with cinnamon sugar.

my co-workers and family all loved this bread...i've tried it with chocolate chips, walnuts and just plain...all are delicious!!...one tidbit though--it took me longer than 1 hour to make sure that my toothpick came out clean, so be patient...it's worth it!

This is a wonderful Banana Bread.  I used cannola oil instead of butter. I also used cinnamon and sugar on the top as well as the bottom and sides. Its great to have a recipe that makes so many loaves.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've never made a banana bread recipe that was bad, so I thought, why bother with yet ANOTHER one?! Glad I did, though, because this one came out moister than any other. Halving the recipe gave me one loaf and two mini-loaves. All other recipes go in the trash, this one's a keeper.

I made muffins instead of loaves and they baked for about 25 minutes. I normally don’t like banana bread because so many are very heavy and dense or oddly moist like they’re under baked. These came out much lighter than other banana bread recipes I’ve tried and my husband loved them!

Awesome! I did not have sour cream so I subbed in Ricotta Cheese. It was still dense without being too heavy. Will be making again.

The flavor was fine. I followed the recipe and it was under baked, gummy and the palest blond I have ever seen for bread. I tried cooking it an additional 10 minutes, but that didn't help. The loaves were dense and heavy. Banana bricks.

After reading reviews I decided to cut out some sugar.  I used 1cup brown & 1 cup regular sugar, and I think I could cut out another  1/2 cup. I also added some mini chocolate chips, so that added sweetness too. It's definitely a tasty recipe . I will make it again.

Like many have said, the BEST banana bread recipe ever.  It would have received 5 stars but for 2 things: 1) 300 degrees for an hour was ridiculous, more like 325 for 1 hr, 15 min.  (2). Why would any recipe be this huge for general use.  And who has 7x3 loaf pans.  I too cut the recipe in half but awkward with original 3 eggs (I used 2 anyway). Would be nice to have this recipe provided for a single use loaf pan. Regardless, my husband says it's the best I've ever made.

AMAZING!! This is the best banana bread I have ever had. I did have to make a few changes because of circumstances. I didn’t have enough of sour cream I used Greek yogurt as well. Next time I may just use the Greek yogurt and see if it changes too much. I also used 7 bananas (I didn’t want to waste any of my over ripe bananas) Lastly I couldn’t find enough of my bread pans. I used a brownie style pan and put parchment paper in the middle. I’m a novice baker at best and I still got this recipe to turn out perfect. This is excellent for a beginner baker.

This has got to be the best banana bread recipe out there. I've been making it for years and anyone who's ever tried it always tells me it's the best they've ever had. I always add an extra banana or two and cut down the sugar down 1/2 C if I'm adding a cup of chocolate chips. I don't even make the cinnamon sugar crust because it's so good even without it. I've tried baking at higher temperatures because 300 degrees always seem so low but then the tops brown too much so no higher than 325. Just stick a toothpick in after 50 minutes. Thank you for sharing this gem of a recipe, Esther. You're the BEST!

I made this recipe today. I found that when the directions and ingredient list are followed it makes four 7x3 loafs perfectly.  The batter i tasted (licked from my fingers) was almost a scrumptious as the finished baked bread. I have been looking for a great sour cream banana bread recipe and i have found it. I cook really well but my baking skills need work. This was easy and made alot.  The only suggestion I have  for anyone making the full recipe and that is once it is time to add the flour, dump the wet mixture into a LARGE bowl that has the measured flour already in it.  Thanka for the recipe!

I have made it as is and got lots of compliments.  
I have also made it with pecans and raisins. 
Total I've made it about 15 times in the last year.

This is a fantastic recipe. I didn’t really need 4 loaves, but I made the full recipe anyways and gave two loaves out. Both people were asking when I’d make some more. I’ll keep this as a go to.

I added the pinch of nutmeg and ground cloves, as recommended by another Baker. Because I live at a lower sea level, I turned up oven to 350° and baked loaves for 1 he 15 mins. (It's likely sea level that doesn't allow the bread to bake at 300° for an hr. I recommend baking the tea bread as you would any other tea breads)

The bread is moist and DELICIOUS!!! The recipe made 4 loaves, as recipe states.  I've made banana nut bread for years. This is absolutely the best recipe ever. I intend to try the lower fat version another time.

Delicious! I misplaced one of my favorite recipes for banana a bread that used sour cream and decided to try this one.  I chose to add pecans instead of walnuts and I followed another user’s advice and baked my 4 loaves at 325 for 1hr 10-15min. They turned out perfectly!!! I will definitely be using this recipe again.

I found this recipe a few years ago, and make it only on special occasions. It keeps it special and highly anticipated. My family and friend absolutely love this bread, and it is devoured quickly! The most outstanding banana bread I have encountered. Occasionally I will add a cup or two of semi sweet chocolate chips to the final mixing stage for those chocoholics. This is truly a moist, flavorful, delectable confection, which has become associated with the the holiday season!

Apologies but I had a request to bake mango cake but never baked any before. I trust the Allrecipes contributors and landed on your recipe. I substituted one cup of mango pulp and voila! that was just yummy yummy yummy! If a store brought pulp got those stars imagine what mashed banana would have brought on the table. Thank you for saving home baker mothers!

This bread is amazing! I find it is to sweet as is, so I cut the sugar in half. This time, i used 5 bananas and 1 apple pureed in the blender. It still turned out great!

I tried to review this earlier not sure if I am double posting. This bread is delicious! I did make a few minor changes based on recommendations. I only had the larger pan’s, and I made three breads. Heat up to 325, and needed to bake it one hour and 20 minutes. I decrease the sugar to 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. Only reason I gave it four stars is because I needed to make some changes other than that it was perfect. Will definitely make again

Fabulous! Used SARALADY19’s ideas on adding nutmeg and cloves, and crumble topping, turned out perfect! I did the entire batch and it makes a ton.

This was so good!  I made this for a Christmas party since I had nothing else on hand to bake. I liked the cinnamon sugar, which turned a normal treat into a Christmas treat.  I would call this the perfect Christmas banana bread.

Absolutely the best recipe for Banana Bread EVER!!! I love banana bread and for years have been trying different recipes. This one is incredibly moist and makes 4 loaves. I made a batch and broke it up into loaves, muffins and mini bundts. 

You can't go wrong and the best part is the cinnamon sugar coating that is on the outside.  I shared at work and home and it was a winner for all that tried it.

I'll never use another recipe again.

This just replaced my favorite recipe of 50 years (if you are looking for a recipe to make a large batch of breads). I received several dozen ripe bananas and went to work. Super tasty - super moist. Thank you.

I have made banana bread my whole life. My husband of 50+ years says this is the best I have ever made. I substituted vanilla yogurt for the sour cream because didn't have amount required in this recipe. So moist and delicious. Thank you for sharing. Baking time in my oven was 70 minutes.  Thank you for sharing. Love Allrecipes for years.

Best. Banana. Bread. EVER! I added chocolate chips instead of walnuts, along with making them into muffins. You just preheat to 350 and cook for 10-15 minutes in muffin pans.

I have made this recipe exactly as listed several times.  The taste is wonderful and my whole family loves it.  It has become a must not only on the holidays, but throughout the year.  However, the baking time is not nearly long enough.  And, coating the pans with a sugar/cinnamon combination makes the bread stick unless I overcook it.

Great moist banana bread.   I still need more banana flavor so will likely add banana and reduce sour creams next time.

This is, IMHO, THE banana bread recipe. I have made it many times over the past 10 years, and it is goof proof! Not to mention the best tasting banana bread ever. I didn’t even like banana bread before finding this, but my husband flipped over it, so when I tried a piece, I was completely hooked! 

My only modification for me is that I don’t use the cinnamon sugar to the pans. I just use the Baker’s Secret spray on the pans. Fabulous every time!

This recipe worked well for cooking with my grandkids. We made our muffins egg-free (3 flax “eggs”), gluten-free and nut-free. Also subbed 1/4 c. butter + 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce for all butter and only used 2 c. sugar. We mixed entirely by hand and baked 35 minutes at 350. Very good. BUT, paper cupcake wrappers stuck to muffin. Silicone would be better.

This is hands down the best banana bread recipe.  I typically spend a whole day and make between 12 to 15 loaves.  I freeze most of them for a later date and they thaw out beautifully.   I have bigger pyrex bread pans so I only make 3 at a time from this recipe instead of the recommended 4.  I get raved reviews and requests all the time for me to make some.

Turned out great but I put the oven at 375 and it’s a min of 45-60 min bake time. I switch up what I put in it. Sometimes walnuts, choc chips and occasionally shredded coconut

Family loved it.  No adjustments other than using splenda instead of sugar and low fat sour cream.   And, baked 1 hr 15 min at 325.  Made one large loaf and 2 smaller.

I made this recipe in disposable mini loaf pans because it seemed like way too much to have out at once and this way it would stay fresh longer. I used brown sugar instead of granulated sugar and I added a streusel topping and a little bit of coffee to give the bread a richer color. Some of the best banana bread I’ve ever had!

Made this a few weeks ago and due to family demands making more.  I would keep one out and wrap and freeze the rest.  This time may just keep them all out as they few out of the kitchen.  Best banana bread I have had in a very long time!

I halved the recipe and it turned out great.  Next time I would cut down the sugar as it was just a tad sweet.  It took about 1 1/2 hours to bake at 300.  This is my new go-to banana bread recipe--it's wonderful!

This recipe is the only one I’ll ever use for making banana bread! The crust is perfect and the inside is moist and spongy.  I only had 3 bananas so I reduced the baking soda to 2 teaspoons, flour to 2 cups, used 2 eggs and 1 3/4 c. Sugar. I couldn’t of had better results!

This was very moist and flavorful.  It will probably be my go-to banana bread recipe.

I have made this recipe countless times. My fans want me to share the recipe often, and I've never had a problem with "brickbread" this could occur if the baker is over mixing or mixing dry into wet ingredients. I want to share my appreciation of the original post of this recipe. I've turned this bread into gifts for Christmas, birthdays, etc.

I used yogurt instead of sour cream. Still amazing. I made 2- 9 inch loaves and saved remaining batter for muffins. Sooooo yummy. Cover top with foil last 1/2 baking time. Cook til knife comes clean. More than an hour for me.

So I followed the recipe to a T and I ended up with two loafs. Also I found if you add 6 Bananas it takes Way longer to cook, so I only put in 4 and it took longer then an hour to cook. Good flavor and texture. All and all I feel this recipe needs to be tweaked to really work.

This is really delicious but the directions don’t say to whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. And it is very important that you do that. The directions are not very robust but the bread is pretty good.

This is an excellent recipe it is extremely Moist. I only had half the amount of flour so I substituted half of it with almond flour and it still worked out fine. I only had two bananas so I turned the recipe into a third and it worked out great. Also I did not have cinnamon so I substituted it with nutmeg, it gave a wonderful aroma.

This was a good recipe! I love making mini muffins. Since this recipe makes a ton of batter - I tried of a portion of it making mini muffins, but since the bread is so soft it didn't hold the shape of the mini muffins well. It did hold a normal muffin size well and the bread loaf was beautiful.

Due to the ingredients I had available, I cut the sugar down to 2 cups vs 3 cups and I put in 7 bananas (I had 7 very ripe bananas that I wanted to use). I also did half white flour and half wheat flour. I increased the cinnamon to 3 tsps (we love cinnamon!)

Very good, and I would make it again.

I've made this recipe multiple times. It's so good I've given it  divided into smaller tins as  holiday gifts at work where we have some serious bakers on staff. I made them jealous! The sour cream is the big secret that I won't share with anyone shhh. The  magical dusting of sugar and cinnamon on the outside doesn't hurt either.

The best ever! I tried others only to throw them away. This recipe is so good, it makes a lot so what I do I make individual breads, in personal pans that are 4" x 2" by  2" deep filled about 2/3 full, bake @300* for about 35 to 40 minutes, my family just gobbles them up.. I freeze what is leftover, they taste just like I made them that day after thawing from the freezer.   I normally put my bananas in the fridge to get them to turn brown right away.. it works great and quick. I also add about 1 1/2 cups of chopped pecans.  1st time I made this recipe I thought that it was going to be too much mix, but I found myself wanting to make more.. def deserves a 5 star rating.. no changes just did exactly what was written and I have probably made this a dozen times over or more..

If I could I would give this 10 stars! This is an amazing recipe! I have to be honest, I cannot stand anything about bananas but after the family loses interest in them, I have to do something with them. When I make this there isn't a crumb left within a couple of hours. I have eaten it and it is good but it is still bananas. It is my go to recipe for "sympathy food" and for family gatherings. You will not be disappointed with this recipe!

This is very delicious banana bread. I substituted the sugar with Splenda to cut the carbs. Absolutely fantastic! My family’s already asking for more and we have 2 loaves left!

I had to keep it in the oven about 10 minutes longer in the small loaf pan and added an extra 20 minutes in the regular size loaf pan. Dusting the greased pans with sugar and cinnamon is brilliant; they slid easily out of the pan and had the delicious sugary cinnamon flavor on the outside.yummy! Lots of fat and sugar, pure indulgence!

I have made it twice and still have two loaves in the freezer. Bread is moist (because of sour cream) and everyone loves it. My oldest granddaughter helped me make it the first time. Good experience for her and me.

This recipe is amazing! I’ve made it many times usually during the fall and winter months but my family has been craving it so I’m going to make a couple of batches. I never change anything from the original recipe because it doesn’t need it! Perfection at its best where this bread is concerned

Way too sweet! I cut this recipe in half since I only had 3 ripe bananas. While, in general, this was well received, it was cloyingly sweet. If I make this again, I’d use half of the amount of sugar- maybe even less than that. The loaf pan does not need to be dusted with sugar and cinnamon.

I love this banana bread.  it's going to be my go to from now on!  I followed the recipe except for lining the pan with sugar and cinnamon.  I used not stick spray.  I also used a mixer for entire process but had on low when adding the dry ingredients. I also changed cooking time to 325 for an hour and ten minutes, covering with tin foil the last 20 minutes. I made 2 loaves with this recipe but it could make 3 easy.

This is my fam’s favorite banana bread so far. I did cut the recipe in half, and added 10 mins bake time to it. I also threw some chocolate chips in there that were in the pantry (also a hit). Yummy!

This is an awesome recipe and simple to make.  With the exception of adding more nuts I followed the recipe to a tee. I kept two out and froze the other two.  This is a definite keeper and I will be making this a lot.  These could be made in mini pans and given as gift but send along a copy of the recipe if you do because people will want it.  Thank you allrecipes.

Uneaten bananas mean time to use this recipe! This is the best banana bread I’ve ever made. Co-workers ask for this on a regular and so do my kids! Very easy to make, moist and delicious.

This recipe is amazing! My mom, a professional baker for years loved it, and my wife's coworkers begged for me to make it again. One tweak, I used 2 9×5 loaf pans and added 20 mins of bake time. Came out just fine.

Everyone loves this one! They all commented “there something so nice about the crust”! I used plain yogurt in place of the sour cream, the rest I followed as directed and it made 3 large loaves for me which required more time, over an hour. I ended up covering the tops with tin foil to prevent them from getting too dark while the centres of the loaves had more time to firm up . I’ll do this again!

My family enjoyed this bread. I made a number of changes to lighten it up.  I followed someone else’s idea and used unsweetened applesauce instead of butter.  I also used Swerve granulated “sugar” for 2/3 of the sugar amount.  I used regular sugar for the other 1/3.  Then I substituted all of the sour cream for Fage 0% plain Greek yogurt.  It all worked!  I made two large loaves so did follow someone else’s suggestion and cooked it at a higher temperature and for quite a bit longer.  
Note:  I haven’t made it the regular way so I can’t compare.  ??

I love this recipe! Every time I make this it always comes out exactly the way its supposed to. At times I've added chocolate chips and it still comes out amazing.  The sour cream really makes it so moist. It's a family favorite in our house.

I tried this recipe in 2013, and I have not made a different banana bread since. It is the BEST banana bread I've ever had. 
I do add twice the cinnamon, nutmeg, chocolate chips to one loaf, and pecans to the other. The cook time is obviously off, but just keep checking it. It's worth the extra wait time ??

My 16 year old calls this the "Cinnamon Bread".  He loves it.  I've made it three times in three weeks.  I've halved the recipe too (used 2 eggs).  Excellent & delicious!!

Absolutely loved this bread!! So moist. Since it’s just me and my son now in the house, I used 3 regular size loaf pans. We devoured the first loaf, I kept the second handy and froze the third.
It’s yummy and one of my favorite banana bread recipes.!!! You can add nuts or chocolate chips but honestly it’s Awesome just as it is!!!

This turned out delicious but I did make changes just because I can. I cut the recipe in half and instead of 1.5 eggs I used flax seed for the .5. I also used brown sugar in place of plain white, and added a TBLS of frozen orange juice concentrate. Then instead of adding walnuts to the batter, since I forgot, I sprinkled the top with cinnamon and sugar and a liberal covering of chopped walnuts. After baking iced with maple buttercream. Everyone thought it was great and all the flavors kept the banana flavor balanced. (Although I love all things banana.)

I cut this recipe in half since there are only 2 of us, and since we wanted breakfast I split it into muffin cups, but the ingredients are all the same. I wanted to use only what I had in the house. we really enjoyed it... muffins for this recipe come out pretty well at 375, 20ish minutes. We got 1 1/2 dozen.

Very tasty. I did make some changes to it.  I halved the recipe and used yoghurt instead of sour cream. I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup. Turned out great. I can only recommend it.

I thought this was a really good recipe. I doubled the recipe and used 5 brown bananas instead of 4. Also instead of folding the walnuts in, I crushed them and layered them on top. Tasted amazing and added a good crunch!

I halved this recipe and it turned out amazing!! I am NOT  a baker whatsoever and so im super excited this worked! I made one loaf of bread and didn’t have another loaf pan so I used a muffin pan. The muffins took 30min to cook and the loaf took an hour! Im saving this recipe for the future! :)

I’ve made this bread several times, I’ve even halved the recipe and it’s turned out perfect every time! I send 2 loaf’s to work with my hubby and get asked frequently to make it. I didn’t change a thing and followed this to the letter it’s perfect! Thanks bunches!

The best banana bread i tried so far! I added chocolate bits instead of nuts. Used 1 stick of butter instead of 3/4 cup. Lessen the sugar by 1/2 cup.
This is now my favorite banana bread recipe. Thank you for sharing ??

I really like this recipe just as it is, but the best thing about it is just how malleable the recipe is. The second time I made it I substituted one cup of brown for one c of white and thought it better. I also added the topping that another reviewer suggested, half c of brown and half c of white sugar with a spoonful of cinnamon and a third to half a cube of melted butter and a bit of flour to make a topping was a must do. And lastly, I took a que from another reviewer and went crazy with the spices, ground cloves, nutmeg, allspice, added ginger and at least one, perhaps 2 secret spices [ones I forgot obviously] and the end result just always seemed to be better than the last. Only bad thing was that I kept making it and had so much laying around that I had to start giving it away....and so then you have more friends and they want more or the recipe and...it's madness I tell you!

I noticed a lot of comments on here about it being a very moist recipe and people were disappointed with how it cooked inside. To counteract that all you need to do is add a little extra flour. Remember banana bread batter should NOT be runny. It should be very thick. So if you have a runny batter, just add a quarter cup of flour until the consistency thickens up. You should bake bread like this at 325 degrees, not 300. It will make all the difference. Also, I added 1 teaspoon of baking powder. For my picture, I had seven bananas so I used 5 cups of flour and 1 teaspoon of baking powder. I also used a little extra cinnamon and an extra teaspoon of vanilla.

I made this bread and it tasted great, but came out extremely dense and remained almost raw on the bottom. It had great bake lines and was even baked longer than suggested. Any suggestions?

Best banana bread. Crispy outside and extra moist. My 9 yrs old daughter followed the recipe as it is except for the 2 cups of sugar instead of 3 c. It was sweet enough. Sour cream really makes a difference.
This is definitely a keeper!

Best banana bread I've ever had!  It was a huge hit with everyone, even the grandkids.  I used two regular loaf pans instead of 4 small and it took about an extra 15 minutes to bake, but came out to perfection.  Highly recommend and will definitely make this again.

Yummmm! Love it! I used what I had on hand, as I usually do :)... so I subbed 2 med shredded apples for the missing 2 1/2 bananas (total about 4 cups of fruit); I didn't have enough sugar, so I added 1/2 c agave syrup.  It's very sweet, so 2 cups would be sufficient;  I used 1 1/2 c oatmeal in place of the same amount of flour; and I used whole wheat flour for the rest.  I only had 2 loaf pans, so I used an 8 count muffin tin!  And I baked @ 350 degrees for 1 hr.  30 min for the muffins.  Next time I'll use all muffin tins!

Boy was this a hit at our Christmas party last night. Wonderful flavor,  very moist. My only complaint is that it took FOREVER to bake. After the quoted hour it was still completely unbaked inside. Took much longer than anticipated but fortunately it was worth it.

Delicious Pumpkin Bread! I made 6 loaves for Christmas gifts. My only add was Mexican Vanilla I bought in Cozumel a month ago. I doubled the recipe so I put in 1 table spoon of vanilla in batter. I will definitely make this again!

Hello there! Phenomenal recipe. I only altered two items: 2 cups of sugar just because 3 cups seemed to many. Moving forward I will use butter for greasing the pan vs baking spray for a much more crisp crust around edges. This is a MUST try!!! Oh, I baked mini loaves vs 1-2 large loaves.

Wow!   Delicious!  1/2d the recipe and now I’m unhappy I did so. I used 1C sour cream and added nutmeg and clove 1/4 teaspoon each.  I increased the baking soda by 50% and high heat started the cooking process 400° for 15 minutes then drop it to 325 for 40 to 45 minutes.

This is one of the best banana breads I've ever made! I made one loaf pan and a Bundt cake pan and it turned out perfectly.  It was a little on the sweet side so I may try and use less sugar next time.  When I get told that this is the BOMB by the family, you know its a keeper.  Thanks to SaraLady19 comments about the crumble she adds...I will ALWAYS add this to my Breads.

Since childhood, banana bread has been a favorite. After making this recipe, I discarded all my old "best banana bread recipes". This is truly moist and delicious. I made two large loaves, not the small ones. Took longer to bake, of course. I used 6 bananas, but they were about 2/3 the size of store-bought Chiquita size.

The time!  Sometimes we put chocolate chips in two of the four loaves.  I can’t say enough great things about this recipe. I’ve passed this recipe on tomso many people as they have tried it and fall in love with it too.

I made this recipe exactly how it's given with a few exceptions: I hand whisked everything because I don't have a mixer, baked it for 1 hour 10 min at 325, I didn't add nuts because I didn't have them, and added the flour last, a cup at a time. This recipe made three large loafs and they all turned out perfectly! Seriously moist, sticky, and 100% delicious.

I make this all the time. The first time I made it exactly as written. After that I’ve been adding medium shred coconut in place of the nuts and I think it’s one of the best recipients I have. The second loaf freezes perfectly.

One of the better recipes. Definitely make the following adjustments...350 degrees, add 1tsp baking powder, and 1 cup of chocolate chips. Cool completely before slicing to avoid crumbling.  For a tasty twist, change out the sour cream for real buttermilk.  Such a great change up.

This has been my go to Banana Bread recipe for years, the sour cream in the banana bread makes it so moist and the sugar topping, what can I say...
 It’s a crowd favorite! I double the reciepe for the holidays and share with my friends and family, a double batch makes 8 mini loaves and 4 standard size loaves.

It was moist but not heavy like some banana breads can be. I cut the sugar by almost half and used vegetable oil instead of butter. This recipe yields A LOT of batter so have extra pans on hand. It filled 3 loaf pans. Everybody loves it.

This is so good. I undermeasured the sugar And probably used about 2 1/2 cups. It was plenty sweet. This is so moist as described that it could be used for cake batter. I Will probably use the same recipe with pastry flour or cake flour next time and just add a coconut cream cheese frosting. Love this recipe.

This is my go to banana bread recipe!  Great recipe and no changes are needed.  I occasionally make this in 1- 9x13 pan and 1- loaf pan.  When I do this 2/3 of the batter goes into the 9x13 pan and the other 1/3 into the loaf pan.
Obviously the cake pan bakes faster so start checking the doneness around 30 minutes.

Pretty good banana bread recipe.  i have made few times as is but this time I skipped dusting the pans with sugar and cinnamon and just used my regular coating with butter and flour.  The reason is that the ones  I made before, when they cooled  down and were left at room temperature, the  sugar that adhered to the crust kind of melted and made the crust  little wet ! Another thing you should do is make sure the walnuts are finely chopped or else the slices  will crumble when you heat a piece of walnut with the knife and won't be neat.

This is the best banana bread recipe, hands down! I stretch the serving size a bit and make an extra loaf for a smaller sized bread. I also use a streusel topping (brown sugar, flour, butter & cinnamon). This is my go-to banana bread, and my husband absolutely loves it!

Excellent.  Also used 1/2 c brown sugar and 2 c white sugar.  Added the crumb muffin topping as suggested and was moist and delicious.  Baked 30 min low 275 and then increased to 350 degrees.

I’ve made this recipe several times and they’ve always turned out great. I usually make them in muffin form and can get 40-50 muffins depending on how full I make my cups. My most recent batch I substituted the butter for coconut oil. I didn’t notice a big difference compared to the times I’ve made them with butter. The sour cream can also be substituted with Greek yogurt; so far I’ve only tried vanilla, with yummy results. These are also great with chocolate chips and extra cinnamon.

It's SO moist. You might think it's undercooked but if a toothpick comes out perfectly clean, it's fine. Just let it rest and cool before slicing. I halved the recipe and lessened the sugar to around 1 cup, then added milk chocolate chunks and chopped walnuts to mine. I also added around 1 1/2 tbsp cocoa powder to half of the batter and ran a spoon through it to marble it. SO delicious. 10/10.

This is such a winner.  One recipe will fill two traditional loaf pans.  This does rise- I learned the hard way.  You can use plain yogurt if you’re short on sour cream.  The streusel topping is a must.

I made the full recipe, and poured the batter into two 8.5 x 4.5" pans plus two 6" x 3" pans.  I baked them at 315 i a convection oven.  The mini loaves were ready in 30 minutes; the large loaves took a bit over an hour.

Changes:  I used 1.5 cups of Truvia baking blend in place of the 3 cups of sugar.

This was perfection!  I wanted only 2 loaves so I used 3 eggs, 4 bananas, 1/3 cup butter, 1 1/2 cup sugar, 8 ounces of sour cream, 1 tsp.Vanilla, 1 tsp. Cinnamon,  1 1/2 tsp, baking soda and  2 1/4 cup flour. All other ingredients were halved. I baked the two loaves at 325 degrees for 1 hour and 10 min. They turned out perfectly.

Amazing recipe. Used 4 bananas because that's what I had, and added 3 tsp of baking powder (in addition to the baking soda). Do not leave out the sugar/cinnamon sprinkle on the bottom of the pan. Holy cow!

Probably the most important change is bake at 325 for an hour and 15 minutes.

Will use this again and again.

This is my "go to" banana bread recipe now. It's so moist and flavorful.  I don't always dust the pans with the sugar/cinnamon mixture because there is plenty of both included in the loaves. Great recipe!

I've  made this frequently following the adjustments in Saraladys review for close to 10 years now and it has become a Christmas time favorite among my family.  I've gotten to the point where I have special pans that are not used for anything else in my kitchen except making this bread.   I now have to make four loaves at a time because my wife and I both take some into our respective offices and an entire loaf will be gone by 9:30!

This is a favorite in my group of girlfriends. Here are my slight adjustments: 2 cups sugar instead of 3, 1/2 cup applesauce to add a little natural sweetness, used frozen sour cream that I thawed and it worked fine. Made 3 dozen regular size muffins, baked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. They turned out perfect!

Delicious! I halved the recipe (2 eggs) and put it in a 9x13 baking pan. I baked it at 325 for 45 minutes and then put tinfoil on top for another 15 minutes. It came out perfectly. My husband and kids loved it.

This turned out great, and very moist. Moist to the point my mom was concerned it was underdone, though it was definitely done baking. I made a couple small adjustments, but otherwise followed to recipe to a T. 
I didn't make the cinnamon-sugar coating for the pans.
I used 2 1/2 cups of sugar instead of 3, and it turned out perfectly sweet.
I used 2 cups of very finely chopped walnuts instead of 1. (thank goodness for blenders) 
And instead of splitting it between 4 pans, I just put the batter in one very long pan, a little over halfway full, and the remainder in a small pan. 
Instead of taking 1 hour to bake, it took about 2, but I think it was because I put it in such a big pan. 

Either way, everyone who tried it (in all age groups, child to elderly) really enjoyed it, I highly recommend this recipe. 
Just bear in mind, it makes a LOT of banana bread.

Made it today. Luckily, I ate the first piece right out of the oven, because  my husband ate the rest of the loaf right after dinner.  We're both in love with this recipe!

I didn‘t have any sour cream but I did have a package of low fat cream cheese.  Substituted that and it is delicious.

I made the lightened up version one person posted and I used all Splenda.  The best banana bread I ever made.  I wish now I had made the full recipe and have more to freeze, but if I’d made the whole recipe and it failed, it would have been an expensive fail. I will surely make it again.

I followed the advice of the first reviewer and mixed the dry ingredients by hand, as well as adding the crumble she suggests at the end. I only needed to make one loaf and so had to quarter the amounts suggested (who makes that much banana bread in one go??). I baked it for over 1hr 20 minutes at 300 degrees to account for the crumble on top keeping the bread doughy. It turned out beautifully, very thick, dense, and moist. The crumble should not be ignored! Very good bread and easy to make.

I love this recipe!  It’s simply perfect.  The sugar/cinnamon crunch added to the backing pan adds terrific flavor and texture.  I also added 3/4 cups chopped Pecans for taste and texture.   And since I only had about half of the sour cream recommended per the recipe , I substituted 1/2 cup whipped cream cheese to make up the difference. My favorite Allrecipes recipe so far for backing//sweat goods.  My husband (who does not typically like sweats) had several portions (he recommends heating up the banana bread with some Maple syrup and/or butter Thank you, all, for your support so fat.

I made this tonight and turned out great. The only thing I had to change was the oven temp. I'm not sure how everyone else was able to bake it at 300 but an hour later I checked on them and they were still completely raw so I bumped the temp up to 330 for another hour and then it was fully cook and good to go.

This banana bread was amazing. I halved the recipe (but used 2 eggs).  The banana flavor was not overwhelming and has a hint of caramel.  And so moist!

This recipe is absolutely amazing! I’ve made it many times over the last couple of years, and it is wonderful! I even gave it as a gift to coworkers this year for Christmas. I stick pretty strictly to the recipe, except for adding a little extra vanilla and cinnamon. Every now and then I will also substitute some coconut oil for some of the butter, but those are pretty much the only exceptions I ever make. I freeze bananas when they go bad, and defrost them to make the bread. It is always super moist. This will always be my go-to recipe for banana bread. Soooo good!

Loved it. Will make it again. The only change I made was using Coconut palm sugar, because that’s what I had on hand. But it does have a slightly lower glycemic index, if that’s a consideration for anyone. Also I’ve made it with less bananas as they tend to be a bit sweet for me. I’ve also been known to throw craisins in. Instead of nuts.

I have made this recipe every year for Christmas for about 9 years now.  My cousins hoard them and hide them from each other.  I do mini loaves and they turn out way better than the big ones!  I also do t add nuts but that’s a personal preference.

I used this recipe because I misplaced my banana bread recipe. I was very disappointed. I raised the temperature to 325 per one baker’s suggestion. Left it for an hour.  Used 2 instead of three bananas and 2 cups of sugar instead of three. The results where flat. The texture resembled more of a brownie mix than of bread. It had a good taste but not the right consistency.  I will try and find my recipe again. Again, I was really disappointed at the results.

I did half this recipe. I substituted bread flour for regular flour and the texture is awesome! I did use 1 1/2 eggs. Love using the dusting the pans with cinnamon and sugar! Great idea! Cooked at 325 degrees. Read that from one other reviewer. Will be my only banana nut bread recipe from now on!

I tried this recipe just because I had all the ingredients and 6 bananas to use up. The bread turned out perfectly! It is moist and delicious and I was happy with the 4 loave quantity! Also the cooking time and temp were spot on! I wasn't sure if I did the sugar cinnamon sprinkle correctly because I sprayed my pans with Pam first. The sprinkle crystallized and Some stuck to the pan but it didn't really hurt anything. It added flavor to the bread and the pan scrape was a nice treat for me to eat!

Amazing! I make these into muffins. I’ve had soooo many compliments on them! I’ve even been called very very bad names at work for not sharing! Freezes well... you can also sprinkle tops then put your finger to make a hole and put more cinnamon sugar in the centre to make a cinnamon bomb.... excellent!

I love this bread!  I did add two extra bananas because I had them and also put more nuts than called for because my family loves nut bread. I had to bake it for a half hour longer because of the extra bananas but the finished product was absolutely delicious. This recipe is my go to from now on!

Delicious!  I love banana bread and I have found it to be something that can easily be changed, here and there.  To make it a little healthier, I used 3 cups whole wheat flour, 1 cup oats and 1/4 cup  'Whole Grain 10 Grain Hot Cereal' (I used Bob's Red Mill).  I used half white sugar and half brown.  I added  1 and 1/2 cups raisins.  I preheated the oven to 350 and cooked it for an hour.   It was moist and fabulous.  I really liked that it made two pans. I actually had 6 overripe bananas.  Perfect! I will make it again.

I only had 3 bananas so I made this with the bananas and about as much shredded zucchini as looked like about 3 bananas worth. Decided to go with muffins instead of a bread and as soon as I bit into one I saw the face of God. Bake time was 30 mins. The sugar/cinnamon in the pan is gold, Jerry. GOLD!

The best, moist, delicious banana bread I've EVER TASTED! I usually get the Starbucks banana bread slices and these are better.  SO glad I found a recipe I like. I cut the quantities in half. This is a huge recipe. I just wanted enough for a single loaf pan not 4! I was able to pull it off with ease. Mix the wet ingredients first like it says but mix all the dry ingredients together in a bowl. It helps with rising if you do it this way. Saw some people complain about it being raw in the middle. Never has happened for me with dry ingredients mixed separately. Man I should sell this stuff!

o......m......g! This is the best banana bread I have ever had. My 3 and 4 year old's love it!  The sour cream really adds flavor and moisture.  Don't be afraid to add even more mashed bananas. The batter will appear soupy but will turn out terrific!

My husband tasted this the first time I made it and said, "That is the best banana bread you have ever made.  Make it like that every time!" He is not a complainer but has a very distinguished palate, so this was high praise indeed. I made the bread exactly as written. The second time I used 1/2 splenda and 1/2 sugar. The result was exactly the same. I did add a crumb topping. It just dresses it up a bit when planning to give as gifts. Thanks for this "keeper!"

We made the bread according to directions - no additions, eliminations or substitutions with regard to the ingredients.  I'm wondering if the issue so many were having with the loaves not being fully cooked was because people weren't paying attention to the size of the loaf pans the recipe called for.  This recipe calls for the pans to be the smaller size (7x3).  I used both large pans and small pans, and the bread turned out perfect baking it for an hour at 300 degrees in the small loaf pans, but I had to add 15 minute to the baking time for the larger loaf pans.

This recipe is totally wrong, if you made this exactly as written and you made zero changes and said it was wonderful, you are a Liar! The temp is so very wrong, not even close to cooking it through!! I want a refund on all I wasted to make these pans of paste!!!!

I made this for my 11 year old grand daughter. it was a hit...Big time!!   I used 3  4 1/2 x 10 1/2 pans. I followed recipe exactly but decided to add a package of semisweet chocolate chips. I will definitely make this again, because I got a text from her today wanting to know if I will make her more! Definitely tween friendly!

Yum! I made these to use up the 6 over ripe bananas. I substituted applesauce for the butter (same amount) & used 3c white flour/1 1/2c wheat flour and skipped the cinnamon/sugar topping. They were still great! It made 35 good size muffins. Baked them 25 min at 325.

Excellent! This is my "GO TO" Banana Bread recipe! I make as is or add to depending on what I have on hand. As other reviewers stated, a dash of ground clove and nutmeg is a great add in. When I have extra blueberries I'll throw them in also.

I've made corn bread from sour dough and I thought it was great! .....till I made this one. The cinnamon sugar you sprinkle on the loaf pan makes the bread taste really special. I love this recipe!

I only had one  very ripe banana...so I had to figure out the quantities, but did and turned out delicious! I used King Arthur gluten free flour and you'd never know it. I baked it in a 9" X 5" pan for 45 minutes. In my favorites now! Oh, I used the brown sugar topping one reviewer recommended & so glad I did.

I've used this recipe a bunch of times, usually tweaking something a bit, always with success. I replace the sour cream with greek yogurt and it comes out really well. This time, I also dissolved the baking soda in a very small amount of hot water and mixed it in before adding the flour. Not sure if this is what made a difference, but the texture was perfect! I also added some butterscotch chips and they go really well in the bread. I've added a lot of things instead of and including walnuts and it's always good, but the butterscotch flavor just went really well! (I just wouldn't over-do it as the flavor can be overpowering, which I've learned with other 'experiments'.) I think other reviews have pointed this out, but 1 hour isn't enough time. Put it in for 1h 10mins and check it.  Putting it in muffin tins works really well, and takes only like 30-40 mins (check them after 20 to get a feel for how much more time they'll need) and they freeze really well and it's easy to thaw as many servings as you'd like.

The best!! I cut the recipe in half, use 2 eggs because 1 1/2 is weird and I don't use the cinnamon and sugar  dusting on the outside. 
I also have to adjust the cooking time for my convection oven but it always comes out amazing!! This is my go to recipe for banana bread.

Out standing!  Swapped sour cream for vanilla yogurt as that's all I had and reduced sugar a little.  I baked this in two large fluted ring tins for just over 45 minutes. Thank you for posting!

My family loves this loaf. I am gluten free and use better batter flour and it turns out wonderful. I also use pecans in place of walnuts. It usually takes an hour and half to bake though.

Very moist. I only had 2 bananas but, it still had a good banana flavor. I also added cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg. Best recipe that I have used for banana bread. Sour cream makes it very moist.

This is a great base banana bread recipe that you can alter as needed, but bake at 350, not 300. Swap the sour cream out for yogourt if you want, half it and add apple sauce to make up the rest or throw in some chewies like plumped dried fruit. Whatever you like! Its pretty versatile. I would recommend baking this in three smaller loaves or muffins rather than one giant loaf. I did my muffins for 45 minutes, my loaves for 1 hour.

this is the only recipe I ever use ! I tried it a while ago and nothing compares - and I have been cooking a LONG time! depending on the weather (and I suppose our oven) I have had to go a little longer in the oven - but the writer suggest testing for doneness as experienced cook would anyway!!! LOVE this & always always get compliments!

Thank you!! I have tried 5 different recipes on here and this is the best banana bread I've ever tasted. The only change I made was pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had.  Ah-maze-ing.

This bread turned out great! I 1/2 the recipe and baked 1hr at 325 deg. I also added a few shakes of nutmeg and allspice. It made two loaves. The bread way really better the next day after sitting under a foiled plate. I will make it again.

This has been in our top 5 Family Favorites for many years now.  I make it exactly as written, but I find I kind of eyeball the number of bananas.  Today I made it with 4 LARGE over ripe bananas, and it was still perfect.  So moist and it has a LOT of flavor!  I have sent them to my husband's job site and he said they raved about it and ate it all.  If you want to be a total Rock Star, take these to your next family gathering :D ;)

This is THE BEST banana  bread recipe I've  ever made.  After reading the reviews I made some modifications.
For the sugar I used 1 -1/2c brown sugar & 1- 1/2c white sugar,
For flour I used 2-1/4c white flour & 2-1/4c wheat flour.
I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts.
I am not high altitude.
Baked @° 325 for 1 hr instead of °300.
Everything else was exactly to the recipe.

I had different size loaf pans, recipe states it bakes 4 loaves,  I used the pans I had on hand which made 3 perfect loaves.
My pans were glass
1- 2 1/2 Qt shallow 11x6 loaf dish,
1-9x6 shallow loaf dish,
and
1-10x6 deep loaf dish ( had to bake this deep loaf dish 10 min longer to make it 1hr and 10 min)

I filled all loaf pans half full which made for 3 perfect loaves, all were moist.
I'm  not sure why others had such a hard time with this recipe, even with my modifications this was very moist and baked evenly with beautiful color.
Everyone raved about the bread, normally they won't  eat banana  bread.

Best banana bread recipe ever!!!  Rich and moist - with an added flavor you can't quite put your finger on - must be the sour cream!!!  I added a couple extra bananas and some almond extract (my secret weapon ingredient!) plus walnuts.  If I'd had dates on hand I would have thrown some chopped dates in too. This is now my "go-to recipe" for banana bread.

Best Banana bread I've ever had. Love the sour cream as it gives the bread a nice fluffy texture. However, 3 LOAFS is way too much I will cut recipe down next time.

This Banana bread is THE BEST !  I find that 1 hour is not long enough to cook it.  I thought it was done, passed the toothpick test, but the centers fell because they were not thoroughly cooked.  I'd add another 15-20 minutes to the hour

Followed recipe exactly, except scaled down to 5 servings since I only had one old banana. It made 3 very delicious and very adorable mini-loafs. (Cooked @ 300 for about 38 mins.)

I had no sour cream so I used full fat Greek yogurt instead.  For banana'bread' it was waaay too sweet. It was more banana cake. I liked the use of yogurt and I liked the taste so I will be making it again but I'll halve the amount of sugar. I rather dust it with icing sugar or spread a bit of butter over a slice.
It took 1 hour and 45 minutes to bake by the way.

I swapped Greek yogurt for the sour cream.  Very good, dense, moist, good flavor.  I may leave the cinnamon out the next time so I get true banana flour.  I will definitely make this again when I have over ripe bananas.

Great recipe.  I took the author's advice and checked with a toothpick at an hour.  An additional 15 minutes was required.  No harm, no foul.
Easy to prepare.  Keep an eye out for "get 'em before they're tossed" discount bananas and make friends and family happy. Yum!

Great taste!  I used my Pampered Chef stoneware mini loaf pan. I slightly buttered it, but not enough to get everything to come out well. I would definitely make this again. Just need to work more on removing it from the pan.

This is the BEST banana bread recipe.  So moist and tasty and the dusting of cinnamon sugar in the pan gives it that little extra.  I dusted the top of the loaf with cinnamon sugar when it came fresh out of the oven.

After years and years of eating only my mom's tried and true recipe, I decided to switch things up. This recipe is amazing! It was immediately my new favourite (I added chocolate chips and Skor chips). The whole family loves it.

Love this recipe, but had trouble with the oven temp.  Checked the loaves after 50 minutes. and they shook like Jell-O.  I upped the temp. to 350, and left them in an additional 20 minutes.
I'll make this recipe again, but in a 350-degree oven.

I am making it today for the second time. You may have gotten a picture if we didn't get company just after it came out of the oven . There was some left but it went along as a snack for the road trip home. Everyone enjoyed it.

Absolutely delicious! Like some others, my oven had trouble baking this to completion at 300 degrees. I did turn the oven up (covered loaf with foil) and finished baking at 325 for approximately another 20 minutes. This is by far the best banana bread I've ever had!!

I am definitely going to make this because it sounds like the best recipe I have seen for Banana Bread and I always prefer to use Black Walnuts but of course if cannot get them the English Walnuts will still be great ???? will let you know how it turned out for me when I make it ??????

It is really good but I think it can be better. I will have to remake this because I put it in the oven for too long and although it is soft and moist inside, but not as I expected it to nor was the top as crispy as I had hoped. I'll remake it and review again!

This is without question the best banana bread I've ever made!  It was so moist my boyfriend knew it was moist when the knife hit the bread!  Don't let the sour cream scare you... it MUST be what makes it so moist and you definitely cannot taste it.  Do not hesitate to make this one....it is FABULOUOS!

I made this yesterday and it is the best banana bread I have ever made. It is sweet, moist and flavorful. Made four loafs. Did not change a thing. Used no salt organic butter since the recipe called for a small amount of salt. I did have to cook them more than an hour though.

I have made this twice and found that the sugar/cinnamon coating on the pans was not as popular as just buttering them up. Also, I did have to bake these for a bit longer than 1 hour....more like 75-90 minutes. All in all though, they came out great and the kids devoured them.

Awesome! This worked well first time 
The sugar and cinnamon on the bottom is a great touch.

I followed this recipe to the letter...it made WAY too much batter so  much that it filled up the four small loaf pans plus one full sized loaf pan and it still spilled over the edge of the small pans....burning onto the large sheet that I luckily had put underneath...what a MESS!  Then the loaves browned leaving the inside raw.....What a waste.   Bummed.

I followed the recipe (as I have the other times I've made this bread), but I also added a pinch of nutmeg with the walnuts.
I poured the batter into two square pans. It came out perfectly delicious!! I was able to cut 60 pieces for a gathering and it worked out great! I used one 7x13 pan and a 8x8 pan to get 2"- 3" tall pieces instead of loaf size. I also put foil around the edges for the last 20 minutes of baking to get the center cooked through with the same color as the edges. I highly recommend the square pans if you don't want such large pieces. It comes out so moist, but check a few spots with a toothpick to make sure it's fully cooked and don't worry if it takes a little longer. Great recipe for delicious banana bread!!

This was a hit.  I made 7 - 6X3 1/2 loaf pans and cooked for about 50 minutes.  This made lots so I could take them to meetings and still have some for home.  A couple are in the freezer.  They stayed moist and good.

this is my new go-to recipe. the only variance is that it took a bit longer than 1 hour to bake (no biggie) & I did add extra cinnamon. Also added nutmeg, cloves & ginger (pumpkin pie spice). Would have been fine without but I like stronger taste. Was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't sweeter that I thought it would be.

Adjusted to 12 servings and it filled fully a 9x5pan.  Used 3/4c sourcream.... and changed sugar to only 1/2c for the 12 servings.  Very moist and delicious.  Thank you.

I have used the James Beard banana bread for 50 years and loved it. I had some buttermilk in the frig and 2 tired bananas so I decided to try this recipe. It is even better than my lifetime favorite.

Delicious!!! This recipe was great. The bread is delicious and moist and since it makes four breads you can share with family and friends.  The only addition I made was to add more cinnamon and I added nutmeg for more spice as another person had suggested. I definitely will be making it again.

I followed the suggestion of one of the reviewers, minus the crumb topping.  The bread was very moist but needed butter.  Next time I will add the suggested crumb topping.

My Grandma lived with us when I was growing up.  She and my mother were the WORLDS BEST COOKS and I was always a kitchen klutz.  So I've muddled along for 69 years with TV dinners and "heat it and eat it "food.  The only time I can recall baking anything was in Home Economics in grade school and a Dutch Oven Dump cake at scout camp.  But I couldn't pitch those 6 brown bananas this morning and found this recipe.  I made some MAJOR modifications to the recipe but it came out PERFECT.  I only had 2 metal pizza pans, and 3 silicon baking molds.  I had a 4x9x3" loaf mold, 6 cupcake mold, and a round 10x2" cake mold.  Modifications were a carton of vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream.  I greased the molds with cooking oil instead of dusting with sugar and spice.  I used almond extract instead of vanilla, pecans instead of walnuts, and added a cup of raisins.  With no expectations of success I mixed it all by hand, ending up with a small dishpan of batter.  [I think it was breeding or something because it kept getting bigger. ]  I spooned all the molds half full and miraculously it all fit perfectly!  The muffin and cake molds were floppy so I placed them on the pizza pans.  The loaf mold went directly on the oven shelf.  I set the timer for 1 hour.  Checking online I read reviews saying only silicon cupcake molds were practical.  I called a friend who told me to expect a doughy center in the round mold.  I checked them at 30 minutes and they were all doughy.  At 45 minutes the too

Normally, I don't post reviews because I so often make numerous changes to the recipes I find on this site and it does bug me a little that people make so many changes and then rate the original recipe.  However, even though I made a few very minor changes,  I still decided to rate this one. Esther, this is a great recipe. Thank you so much for sharing it!  I have been baking various forms of banana bread for almost as long as I can remember baking so I am always looking for a new recipe to try. What intrigued me about this recipe was the dusting of sugar and spice on the pans before putting the batter in.  I wanted to make the recipe as it was originally written but I was prevented from doing so partly by my own faulty memory. When I went to the grocery store I meant to buy sour cream and forgot so all I had was about a third of a container of light sour cream to use for this recipe. To make up for the difference, I used plain nonfat Greek yogurt. I did not find that doing so compromised the flavor or texture at all.  I made two other changes and they were: I had just ground whole wheat for a bread recipe and had some left over so I substituted one cup of whole wheat flour. And, because I don't ever make anything banana without nutmeg,  I added a little bit of that to the quarter cup of sugar for dusting the pans and a couple of shakes into the batter. I mixed  the flour and sugar for the dusting in a bowl and had a little bit left at the end so I mashed the  bananas in that

Perfect! This hits all the sweet spots for me - generally basic ingredients I regularly have in the house, moist but not squishy, with that perfect sticky top after being wrapped up overnight. *Exactly* what I was looking for.

This recipe makes a moist, tasty, chewy banana bread. I made four loaves and gave two to friends. They loved it. My husband raved about it. I added walnuts and raisins to the batter and served it hot with melted cream cheese on top.

An amazing recipe! Love it!  The temperature is definitely off though. I baked mine at 350 for about an hour and 10 minutes, but started checking it with a toothpick at 50 minutes as to not over bake it. Otherwise, deeelish!

The biggest baking disaster ever! I questioned the cooking temperature and pan size but followed it . The batter ran out all over my oven, and after 90 minutes, the centers were still not done. Will have to throw them away and clean my oven!

I was about to throw out some bananas when my 13 year old daughter asked to make bread.  Mom's recipe wasn't available so found this one.  LOVED IT!  Very moist and flavorful.  Recipe was easy enough for my daughter to do by herself.  Will most definitely not be throwing out any more bananas!

Amazing! Use just ripe bananas NOT overripe bananas. Just ripe bananas have more moisture in them and will make the finished bread a lot more moist too.

Since I'm not from the US i haven't had bananebread before I made this recipe.
So in all fairness I have noting to compare it with. 

I had to change a few ingredients. 

1- I did not have sour cream on hand so I substituted full fat (that's 10%) Greek Yoghurt. 
And 2- Bevause I was afraid I would find it to dense. (After seeing all the photos ) i added halve a table spoon of baking powder to get a more airy result. 
We are more accustomed to fruit cakes then fruit breads. And I want to ease my fam into American style dishes.

I made 2 flavours 1 original with the cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg  (I read it in one of the commends and I like that it deepens the flavour and adds a bit of extra spicey warmth ) and i sprinkled the sugar cinnamon over the top of the loaf. 

And i mixed halve the dough with a cup of semisweet chocolate chips and 150 grams of sweet grated coconut. for my husband who doesn't like cinnamon. (And for my 6 year old daughter who likes everything chocolaty ) I did mixed an extra egg to compensate for the extra dry ingredients. 

And prayed I did not mess up the recipe since I'm a beginner baker and wing a lot of my creations. 

I know I should not but thats how I'm used to cook and it's hard to realy figure out what effects an extra egg or additional ingredients do to a recipe when your just starting out the journey of backing. Specially foreign recipes. 

But....

Both where amazing. I baked 2 loafs and had left over batter from both flavours. (I don't ow

Best recipe ever but I did bake it at 325. Everything else is good. Also, I mixed by hand, thoroughly mashed the bananas, and started checking it at 50 minutes since all ovens vary in temperature. Thank you for a great recipe!

I liked the flavor, and the coating, but I really didn't like the texture. For me, it came out very doughy. I made it in a pair of 9x3 pans, instead of 4 smaller pans, which normally is not a problem. The cooking time was increased to 1hr 30 to pass the clean knife test to make up for pan size.

Definitely will make it again.  I only had 4 over-ripe bananas so I added about 1/4 cup of applesauce and the bread was perfect.  I not only used the sugar & cinnamon mixture to coat the crocks after greasing & flouring each but  also sprinkled the tops with it.   Made 4 small loaves (Pampered Chef 4 loaf stoneware 3 x 6" each), 1 round PC Crock and 12 muffins (added pecans to the muffins).

This is my go to recipe.  Everyone loves it!  The only difference is that I make 3 loaves with it.  I also use it for mini bread loaves.  I do increase the amount of cinnamon and sugar for dusting when making mini-loaves.

OMG I thought I died and went to Heaven.  I've made a lot of very good Banana Breads but this one is the BEST of ALL and deserves SIX STARS!.  While you are making it, it doesn't seem to be so spectacular but the magic occurs in the oven and you and your Mother-In-Law will NOT be disappointed.  I tweaked by adding 2 teaspoons Banana Flavor (Hard to find) and I am completely sold on substituting Badia Pumpkin Pie Spice instead of Cinnamon for all of my recipes.  Don't laugh till you try it, it's a superior exotic blend.

PS take a taste of the batter before you bake it,  then fill your pans, and while they are baking, sit down and lick the whole bowl clean!!

I made the full recipe and it made 2 regular sized loaves with some left over for a small loaf. I cooked it at 325 for 1 hour and 7 minutes. I added a dash of nutmeg, ground cloves, and chocolate chips.

I put 1/3 less sugar, added 1C dry oats, and used 1/2 whole grain flour. ill probably decrease oil a little next time, was a bit greasy but overall delicious!

I've tried many banana bread recipes but this is the best so far!  Followed the recipe exactly and came out great!  My husband took a few slices to work and got many requests to make more so I made it into muffins and still came out great.  Thank you!

This banana bread is much moister  than Janet's Rich Banana Bread.  This is a little floppy, but just toast it a bit and it's grand.  Janet's is heavy and seems to taste as if there are not as many bananas in it.  Both are delicious!

I followed the directions exactly.... except made one large loaf and 36 muffins.  They were really moist and delicious.  The muffins were better the same day, still good as leftovers, but worth mentioning.  I will definitely make them again.

Made this bread for work, instead of 2 loaf pans I used my extra large brownie pan (15 x 19 I think). I also skipped the cinnamon since some co workers dont care for it. Overall they loved it, was very moist.

This is a delicious banana bread. I have made it quite a few times and it comes out wonderful every time. I have made as stated but I usually cut back on the sugar because it is a little too sweet for my taste but still a 5 star recipe!

This rating is for the bread. Followed the recipe and added nutmeg and cloves per one reviewer suggestion.  It came out really good and moist. Baking time however was another story. The middle wasn't done. Baked it for another 30 mins and it came out perfection. DH loves it.

Good recipe! I  made only 1 loaf (cut the recipe into 4) and used half White Whole Wheat flour and half all purpose flour.  I cut the sugar back to about 1/2 cup.  It came out really good!  I will try whole wheat pastry flour next time and see if that helps it rise a bit more.  Great recipe to keep on hand as an alternative to my standard banana recipe for times when I don't have milk!

Gotta say I was freaking out a little bit only because I decided to make this 2 1/2 hrs. before I had to be at a Christmas party at sister in laws. but it all turned out fine, was in the oven an extra 1/2  hour. Really turned out great, with lots of compliments. MOIST and flavorful is key.

My 6-year-old and I made this banana bread endless time.  That most probably the best banana bread we had ever had.  It is very moist.  There was a time I even cut everything in half to cook a smaller batch.  It came out perfect, too.

I did try to use vegetable oil instead of butter once.  It definitely doesn't taste as great as with butter.  But if you want to go for a healthier version, the taste may be ok with you.  Just the matter of getting use to it.

All in all, I highly recommend for anyone looking for a great banana bread recipe to try this one out.

I've been making this banana bread for a few years now. This is the best banana bread ever! I let my banana's age for a few weeks and it makes it so much better. I don't need another banana bread recipe. This is it for me.

This recipe is perfect!!  Bread was moist, with no hard crust!!  My bananas are always overly ripe and soft - provides more banana flavor!  I happen to have 8 bananas when I made this and put them all in.  Didn't mess with nutmeg or anything to distract from the banana flavor. I believe the sour cream is the key to this recipe!!

This was fabulous!  So easy and very delicious- I did omit the salt because I don't care for extra sodium in my food.  Note that this does make a LOT of bread so don't start thinking you will have just one loaf.  The sugar and cinnamon dusting was a nice idea because it caramelized in the pan and made a crispy sweet crust on the bottom, great and noted by everyone.  The other side to that is being careful if you try this in the very dark metal pans.  They cook far hotter and this can burn the sugar.  So glad I found this!

Very good, flexible recipe. I used whole wheat pastry flour and whole milk greek yogurt, just because that's what I had on hand. I also cut the sugar down to 2 cups and used half brown sugar... next time, I may cut back a little more.  I got two dozen muffins and a large loaf out of the full recipe. The muffins baked for 20 minutes at 350 degrees and the loaf took about 45 minutes at the same temperature. Definitely will make again!

I'm not too fond of sour cream but decided to make this anyway, hoping it would be moist. It was. I cut the recipe in half and used a bundt cake pan, added raisins, 1 tsp of rum, and it was delicious! Maybe some small apple chunks will the only other change I'll make next time I make this bread.

I love this recipe. I have made it twice. I only had fat free sour cream the second time, but didn't notice a difference. I have had to bake it about 10-12 mins longer. Great recipe, thanks.

The sour cream adds a nice richness to the banana bread.  I used half the sugar and added some chocolate chips.

I cut the sugar in when making the full recipe. Also this makes a huge amount, like 3 loaf pans huge. Amazing, fluffy and perfect.

Followed recipe but decided to add 2 cups of frozen blueberries instead of the nuts.  It made 3 various size bread pans and was baked in a 325 degree oven and it took forever it seemed to bake (probably about an hour and twenty minutes!) but with drooling patience we survived the wait and the payoff was worth it :)

This was delicious!  I am not a baker but I am looking for some yummy yet semi-healthy recipes for school snacks so, when I had some browning bananas on my counter, I gave this one a shot.  Thank you to all of your for your recommendations and substitutions.  I also halved this recipe and, with only 2 mushy brown bananas, I baked a third in the oven for 20-25 minutes to get it to "ripen."  I substituted 2% Greek Yogurt for the sour cream so that it would be higher in protein and lower in fat and it turned out fantastically.    I left out the nuts so my son could bring it to school (where some have nut allergies).  He and a friend just came home from school and polished off 4 slices of this bread.  Will definitely make again.

This is the best banana bread I've ever had.  Made it exactly as described.  Used 2 loaf, glass pans.  Filled only 3/4 of the way and it did raise above the top spilling over into oven however, this worked out perfectly because the top hardened quickly allowing me to cut it off - continued baking the rest and the inside and top were absolutely perfect!  No more hard topped banana bread!  This was very moist and very banana tasting!  Great job!!!

300 for 1 hour was not enough. Took 1 1/2 hours at that temperature in my oven. 350 for an hour gave great results.

Experimented with substituting 2 cups packed brown sugar & 3/4 cup maple syrup for the white sugar (great!) in one batch & adding 2 more bananas, 2/3 cup water & 1 6.5 oz jar of PB2 peanut butter powder in another (may need to add more sweetener on that one, plus it bumped the volume from 4 loaves to 5).

Delicious! I took SaraLady19's tips and it helped quite a bit. I halved the recipe using 2 eggs and 3 bananas. In addition to the cinnamon, I also added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and an 1/8 teaspoon of clove. Baked at 325F for 1 hour and it was perfect!

this is a great recipe. I've used it several times. it's always moist and tasty. I add Chia seeds to mine and end up with plenty of bread which is great because it would be gone in a day if there was only one loaf.

I will make it over and over again.  We have apple bananas here, so I had to use  8 instead of 6.  I was worried about how thick the batter was, but it baked up so nicely.   Made some mini-muffins since I only had 3 loaf pans, and they were great too (about 30 minutes).

Greetings, I did not have that size loaf pans, so I cut the recipe in half, except I used 2 eggs. And used a bundt pan for the whole concoction. 

WOW! Most excellent!

I think this might be my first review of a recipe on here. 

I have made this a dozen or more times now (MANY of those being by request). AS IS. no substitutions - no additions or changes!! 

(ok one change - I didn't have the right size pans so I improvised there but THAT'S IT.) I have used my big bread pan, mini loaves, and even muffin tins. it's not hard to figure out when it's done and get them out on time.  

Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe!!!

I made this about 9 years ago and it turned out terrible. It was wayyyy under baked and ruined. This time I made it, I baked it at 335 degrees, for 1 hour and it was perfect.  I only had 14 oz Sour Cream, so I used 2 sticks butter instead of 1.5. Awesone texture, moist, 5 star banana bread!

This is a great recipe - very moist and banana-y - a great way to use up A LOT of extra bananas.  It makes a perfect banana muffin recipe  too.  I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream which worked well.

My absolute favorite banana bread recipe! I add a little nutmeg and don't dust the pans with cinnamon and sugar (tried it and found it didn't make a difference, so I skip this step), otherwise followed the recipe. I use standard loaf pans and it makes 3 nice-sized loaves.300F might do well for the smaller pans that the recipe calls for, but with my pans I baked at 325F for an hour, maybe a few minutes longer.

I put all four loaf's in the oven and two of them sorta sunk in the middle after taking them out. Though the cooking time is near perfect (I cooked for six more minutes) I would only cook two at a time next time.

It turned out too dry, with little banana flavour (the ratio to flour was just too little), and the taste is just blah. 4.5 cups of flour is just too much.

I've made this recipe about a zillion times and it has never disappointed.  We make it into muffins and cut down the baking time and heat a little.  I substitute nonfat greek yogurt for the sour cream and it adds a little bit of protein without any loss of flavor.

GOOD.  Used only 4 bananas.  Try again with 6-7 bananas next time.  Used a bundt pan and a 9 x 5 pan.  Did not use sugar and cinnamon for the bottom of the pans.  Also only used 1 cup of sugar.

I left out the cinnamon. It turned out well. I took it to work and shared it with co-workers, they loved it. I have made it 3 times, so yes, I would make it again.

I've made this bread with and without the cinnamon  & sugar dusting of the bread pans.  The bread alone is amazing, moist & delicious - better than any I've ever had.   The cinnamon sugar dusting adds that extra special touch that is definitely worth it.  Once you make it, you will receive many requests for it time and again.

I followed this recipe exactly. The only thing I changed was baking temp.  I baked at 325 for one hour and the 9X5 pans were cooked perfectly.  The 9X6 pan was done after an extra 15minutes of baking time. Was delicious! Thank you!

Oh my goodness,  this banana bread is so good! The only thing I changed was, I used gluten-free flour. Turned out moist and delicious.  Also so easy to make!

Healthier  alternative.
I used honey to replace sugar, coconut oil to replace butter and low fat whipped cream to replace sour cream.
It took 2 hours to bake, but was worth the wait.
I might add currents and mixed spice next time(0:

Batter was easy to make and it smelt amazing when baking, but, even after an hour and 20 minutes it was still raw in the middle. I should have gone with my idea of putting the mix in cupcake moulds for smaller loaves that are an easier size for lunch boxes.

This is the BEST banana bread.  I used to very large loaf pans and baked at 325 for 10 minutes longer than the recipe says.  They were Perfect!

Hands down our favorite banana bread recipe!! I make 6 loaves at a time because my guys go through it so fast (in the spring I stock the freezer to have all summer)! I usually make 2 plain, 2 chocolate chip (use mini chips) and 2 blueberry (use frozen berries). I make them in 2 - 9x3 pans. They need to cook for 1hr 20-30min (depending if you're mixing in choc chips or blueberries).  I also add the crumble from the Banana Crumb Muffin recipe. Yum!! They freeze great!! Now trying to figure out how to make them in my mini muffin pan. As my kids won't eat any other banana bread/muffin recipe!

Wonderful recipe! Loved the taste. But next time I'll be substituting 3teaspoons baking soda for baking powder.  I should have risen a little more, and I should have known that without the powder it wouldn't. 
Overall the taste is amazing! I did but in 8 banana's also.

This is a great recipe! Moist and delicious.  I wasn't sure about the cinnamon at first but it tasted so good and I've gotten so any compliments that I will probably continue making it just as written but I am sure you could just take out the cinnamon if you don't want that.

Very nice banana bread.  I'm pretty picky when it comes to banana bread since I've been making it for years. This makes a lot of banana bread, so I made two loaves and 16 muffins.  I topped the muffins with the cinnamon sugar mixture, using brown sugar instead of white to make it pretty.  I also didn't have sour cream so got creative and used a splash of milk and cream cheese instead. My oven bakes best at 350 or 375, so I baked at 350 for 1 hour for the bread and 350 for about 35 minutes for the muffins.  Turned out very well; I'm either going to freeze a loaf or two or take it to work.  Thanks for the recipe.

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!  We made them as muffins.  My husband is a picky eater and he LOVED these.  They were very moist, and the cinnamon sugar on the bottom is a delightful touch.  I made them two days in a row, the second time was gluten free using rice flour, and they were still amazing.  Best muffins I have ever made!

I made this Late at night and took the loaves to my firehouse the next morning... The guys have been killing it all morning. Excellent recipe. I substituted 3x baking Powder for Baking Soda (I was out of baking soda) and I used Splenda in place of white sugar. Slightly healthier and tastes great!

Excellent recipe. Very moist. The only thing I changed was to decrease sugar to 2 cups and it was perfectly sweet. Next time I will double the pecans. I really liked the cinnamon and sugar on the outside.

The best banana bread!! So moist. After making the recipe the first time I had to increase the cooking time by almost 10 minutes it came out too doughy. Chocolate chips and walnuts are a must.

300* definitely is not hot enough - I do 350 but this is the best banana bread recipe ever! It can easily be halved but I make the whole thing and make a mixture of mini loaves and muffins. The mini loaves go in the freezer and are just as amazing when you take them out. This way we never run out of this staple! It is THAT good!!

Make it! Just do it! The best Banana bread ever, seriously! I followed the recipe exactly, just halved it and it made two loaves. The first loaf was gone that night, the other loaf the next day! The cinnamon sugar on the outside really makes it tasty so don't forget that step!

This is very good. I cut the recipe in half since I didn't want 4 loaves of bread. I also baked it in a 350 oven like just about everything else we make calls for.  Worked out fine. I also added nutmeg.

I have been making  this bread for a while.  love it!  But today when I was about to make it again I remember I had sourdough starter I need to use. So 1 1\2 cups of starter go's in everything else the same. That makes it even better ( if that's possible).  This is my new addition to this amazing recipe.

I made this for my family and everyone loved it! I did not grease the pan or put the cinnamon/sugar mixture on the sides of the pan!  I used Pam to keep the bread from sticking and I used the cinnamon/sugar mixture on the top and baked it in a 8.25x4.5x2 pan at 350 degrees for 1 hour!

Perfect! This will be my go to recipe for banana bread. I added a bit of nutmeg for personal preference; other than that, followed the recipe as written. Moist, flavourful, held together, and the cinnamon-sugar dusting put it over the top! Thank you!

My husband said it was the best of any I've ever made-and that's in 48 years! It makes 4 large loaves so next time
I am going to increase the salt to 1 1/2 tsp. Otherwise--splendid!

A good recipe. I cut back on the sugar, my bananas were very ripe and sweet. I will make this again.

This is the best banana bread recipe!!! It's the only one I use now. My granddaughter loves banana bread but not walnuts however she tried a slice, then another and another. Needless to say she ate almost a whole loaf by herself.  Luckily there was 3 more for everyone else.  Adding crumble/strudel on top makes it even better.

Will definitely make it again.  I brought one loaf to a neighborhood party and it was gone so fast, I went home and brought the other loaf that went just as fast.
I halved the recipe, added lots of cinnamon, cloves and fresh nutmeg; chopped walnuts; and I substituted greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  For sugar I used a scant cup of Splenda for Baking and 1/3 cup brown sugar.  
I baked them in two 7" X 3" Pyrex dishes w/ oven set at 320.  
At  60 minutes they were ready.

I feel this is the best banana bread recipe that I've found and baked. I've made it at least 40 times and people I've given the loaves to have asked for the recipe. This is a wonderful recipe!!!! The only change I made was to increase the baking temp to 325° for 45-60 minutes.

Really good recipe. I would have added more cinnamon, but only because I like cinnamon. Need to cut it down next time cause it was a bit too much for my family. Still good stuff with this  recipe!

My family loves this bread. It's so moist and delicious. I usually make it as muffins so it's easier to eat and add some craisins, walnuts and even chocolate chips for an extra treat!

This is a great spin on traditional banana bread. I have made this multiple times, and always to rave reviews.  I always keep a loaf of this bread in the freezer at our lake house to serve to overnight guests.  Perfect for an anytime snack. I bake this in two 12x4 loaf pans for about an hour @350. I also add semi-sweet chocolate chips in one  loaf instead of nuts. 
Excellent!

I get so many compliments every time I make it.  The only think I changed is the timing, it always takes about 80 to 90 minutes.  One hour is not enough.

So goooood! For a healthier option you can substitute the sour cream with yogurt and half of the sugar with dates! Just put the wet mixture in a blender with the dates before you stir with everything else. Still tastes terrific!  I also had to up the baking temperature by 15 degrees or so.

I made this recipe and followed the instructions to the letter. However, I did increase the BAKING TEMP to 325* vice the 300 called for. The bread came out perfect!!! This will definitely be my BANANA BREAD recipe from now on!!!

Very moist and great flavor. I halved the recipe and made one nice size loaf. At 300* it took over 90 minutes to bake. I did not change anything about the recipe. A keeper.

This was really good - made more than I had expected and had to bring out another loaf pan.  The sour cream is such a nice addition to banana bread.

This was exceptional as it is listed. Moist, and tasty! Tried it heated, toasted, and cold. All were fantastic! Great go to recipe - this makes a huge batch, so you might consider cutting in half if you don't intend to freeze half of it.

I got a second degree burn in my forearm getting this out of the oven. But everyone in the party agreed I could burn the other one if that's what it takes to make another one of these beautiful and innocent loaves.

Excellent recipe! I halved it and made a loaf and six muffins. Both were baked at 325,  40 minutes for muffins and 1 hour 15 minutes for the loaf. I also added a crumble topping recommended by another reviewer, which the kids loved!
I can't keep them away from the little one! Thank you for a wonderful recipe. They are so popular in my house I am going to try applesauce instead of butter next time to try to "healthify" them:0)

Very tasty. I used applesauce vs butter, always do in baking, same amount. No nuts, added raisins. Since there were a lot of comments of cooking temp, I baked at 325, for almost the full hour, perfect. I used two loaf pans and one bundt pan, worked out perfect. Plan on freezing the loafs. I'll use this recipe again!

Best ever banana bread! Don't change anything. I am an experienced baker and never could perfect banana bread until I found this recipe. Others were either too sweet, not sweet enough, soggy in the middle, etc. but this one is perfect every time.  I love the cinnamon/sugar dusting in place of flour, I have used that on other sweet bread recipes as well.

This was very good, moist bread. I halved the recipe & didn't need to change the cooking time/temp - I did use a convection oven though. While the recipe will make a great banana bread, I was a bit disappointed since I was hoping it would have a bit of sour cream flavor. This is not the case. Also, the bread was a bit sweet for me. I think next time I'll cut the sugar a little.

I've never coated a bread pan in cinnamon/sugar before & WOW! It's really amazing. It created this crispy layer on the outside that gives the "crust" an unbelievably yummy texture.

It's the saddest looking banana bread I've ever made, and the bake time does need adjusting. I cooked it for an hour at 300F, turned off the oven and let it sit in the oven for 10 more minutes: that baked it all the way through; although, it weirdly still tasted doughy. Nice and golden on the top, but it didn't rise muc Next time round, I'll leave out the sugar/cinnamon pan-sprinkling, and add dark chocolate chips instead.

The taste was just okay (and I added extra spices-- cloves & nutmeg), but I too had trouble with baking.  I set the oven higher than listed-- at 325 for 70 minutes and still had to add another half hour!  Even then, the middle fell.  Hmmmm, not sure what went wrong.

Sorry Grandma, this one is better. I made this recipe exactly as written. Every ingredient, every amount, and baked at 300 degrees for 1 hour. And let me tell you, my whole family devoured one loaf of this banana bread within three minutes of removing it from the pan. It was exquisite.

I added a little bit of pumpkin pie spice as well as a little extra nutmeg ( contained already in the pumpkin pie spice but I wanted to add a little extra flavor for this crowd).

Tough for me since I've been using a different recipe for YEARS and everyone said it was great. Well, today I randomly tried this one (mostly because I had SO many ripe bananas) and my husband now insists I stick with THIS recipe. 
This is a HUGE amount-- i made two loaves plus six big muffins out of it.  But not too much butter, which is nice. I suppose I will halve the recipe next time. I think you could probably go a little lighter on the sugar, but it is pretty tasty this way. The other thing is that I was out of sour cream. So I went with greek yogurt-- about half vanilla greek yogurt and the other half plain. I did add a bit of nutmeg and probably could have added a full teaspoon. My loaves started browning a little fast so I covered them with tin foil. I stuck with the tried and true wooden skewer test for doneness rather than using the time-- and I think my oven was a little hot too. In any case, the texture was perfect.

It is by far the BEST recipe I've tried, and I've just about tried them all. The sour cream makes a HUGE difference in taste and texture. Love this banana bread. I also use the same recipe but swap out bananas for zucchini.

Whenever I make this recipe I feel like it's gone as soon as I turn around! Once I was running low on sour cream, so I replaced half of it with plain Greek yogurt. This change seemed to make it even more cake-like, so now I always do the half Greek yogurt substitution.

Great recipe!  I followed other contributors suggestions and  cooked at 325 degrees for nearly 1.5 hours.  But I only made 1 large bundt cake and 1 other small loaf with the batter.  I did cover them the last 25 minutes to avoid having the tops overcook.  I added nuts and raisins.  But the biggest change I made was I used 1.25 cups of Stevia and .25 cups of brown sugar instead of the 3 cups of sugar in the original recipe.  It turned out just fine.  It got raves from the family.  Moist and tasty.

I was a little skeptical about adding the sour cream but this turned out great. I didn't give it 5 because you do have to bake it a bit longer than suggested.

I have to say that I have made this banana bread several times and it's awesome!!  I do not change a thing.  I've made them for church fairs, gifts, family and I always get compliments on them.  Great recipe.  No need to change a thing.  =)

I have made this more times than I can count!  I could only find pans that were slightly smaller, it makes 7 loaves.  I do add 1/2 t nutmeg, every oven is different, so timing is always approximate.  Small pans are critical.   It is THE BEST banana bread ever!  Thank you so much.

I followed the recipe exactly as written.  What a disappointment!!  The texture is more like a cake than a bread.
I followed the advice of other reviewers and baked it longer so it was completely done, but it  made four little Flat, not very tasty, loaves.  And who has tiny bread pans in their cupboards.  I have several sizes and used my smallest, but they still didn't seem to rise at all.  If this banana bread had tasted good I wouldn't have complained about  the pan size. 
This was just a frustrating endeavor.

I like to change this recipe up depending on what I have by varying the nuts or adding chocolate or butterscotch chips. 

They always turn  out beautifully! No need to look any further!

This was the moistest banana bread I've ever made!!! it was so soft and delicious!! I made 3, 7 1/2 by 4ish loaves and then 12 muffins, so it made a ton! I also used 2 cups of brown sugar and 1 cup of white. However I'll probably cut the sugar down next time, it is very very sweet with all that sugar plus the sweetness of the bananas. I think with 6 bananas, you could probably do with one 2 or 2.5 cups of sugar. But overall very good, and I will make again!

Made it twice.  Didn't change any of the ingredients.  Just upped the oven temp to 325 degrees the second time.  Seemed to take less time to cook without burning or drying out.  Just YUMMY!!  My favorite banana bread recipe.  I make it in 2  9x5" pans and they come out perfectly.

So, I didn't quite have enough sour cream or bananas. This was no problem though. I simply added enough whipped cream cheese to make up for the missing bananas and sour cream, and it turned out absolutely decadent. By far the best banana bread I've ever had. Next time, I'm going to add some shredded coconut, and dried pineapple chunks, and replace the walnuts with pistachios. I'll let you guys know how it turns out :)

Halved the recipe, made two loaf pans.  Used 2 eggs, 4 small blackened bananas, 3/4 cup each white and brown sugar and probably 10 oz sour cream, it was what was left in the cont.   cooked for 55 mins, could have pulled at 53. Really good, moist and perfectly dense.

Super moist and I added mini chocolate chips.  Great great bread just be cautious not to over bake as it can be a little dryer.  Used this same recipe for muffins and mini loaves   thank you to the originator and for sharing

Really  good. I did substitute butter(because  I  was  out) for coconut  oil. I also added  brown  sugar. I reduced  to  10 servings. OK -I only had  a round  pan as well !  It still  works.

Yes, I would make this again.  Somehow i goofed and used four eggs plus only had a half container of sour cream but it made no diff.  Spiced rum replaced vanilla and i used a full tsp of salt.  Toasted the chopped nuts and added 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice along with 1 tsp cinnamon. Sounds like lots of changes but I've bee stirring up many loaves of banana bread thru my life and I know what we like.  Oh, another change was to sub one cup of white whole wheat flour for all purpose.  I think it could have been up to half with no taste difference. My hubby likes to eat whole wheat so that way I could say that yes, it has whole wheat :-). As others said, you should 'probly loosely cover the loaves with a sheet of tin foil after half the baking time. These baked 50 min in 325 degree oven but please, always check several times before time is up.

This was really good. Omitted the nuts.  Cut the recipe in half and filled a 9 x5 loaf pan. Didn't change the cinnamon/sugar topping amount. Used it for dusting the bottom of the pan and the rest put it on top before baking. Baked it for one hour in a glass pan at 325 then tented it with foil and reduced the temp to 300 until a knife put through the center came out clean about an additional 20 minutes. It was so moist and delicious.

Made this twice, first time as directions said, though I baked at 350 for one hour and came out perfectly. 2nd time I cut the sugar by about half and added one cup semisweet chocolate.  Yum! Makes 2 sense, sweet loaves and two mini loaves for me. I also use plain yogurt instead of sour cream.

I made 2 of the 9x5 loaves with this recipe. I cooked it at 300 for 75 minutes.  I took it to school for the first day of class and my students --all college students--couldn't believe their teacher would make them homemade bread. The loaf was gone almost instantly. I even cut the slices down the middle, and they all took seconds. My family loved it and I loved how moist it was. The only change to the recipe was that I used pecans instead of walnuts, because it's what I had on hand.

I have made this several times and it is wonderful! I followed the  recipe (with and without nuts). Would not change a thing. Everybody likes it and will continue to make over and over. Most banana bread recipes are too dry and need lots of butter to moisten. Not this one.

This was fantastic! Very moist but also very sweet. I'd decrease the sugar a bit next time (my bananas were extremely ripe and probably added extra sweetness). I divided the batter in half-  made one with chocolate chips and pecans, the other plain banana, both were great. I didn't bake@300° rather, I divided the batter and placed in two brownie pans and baked @350° for 30 min.
*Update: added peanut butter, about 1/4 to  1/3 cup, gave it a nice hint not too overwhelmingly peanut buttery taste.

I do not bake. I love to cook and drink, but baking is not my thing.  With that said, this is the easiest template there is.  Follow the instructions and make another cocktail.  Put your goods in the oven, and finish your umpteenth cocktail... And you have dessert.  Thumbs up and thank you!!  (If you care, used chocolate chips in place of nuts...wife hates 'em)

I changed the recipe a little.  I used 2 cups brown sugar instead of the white.  Used half whole wheat flour and half white flour.  I added 2 tbs flax seeds to the batter and I sprinkled only the top with walnuts.  This was very good.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made these exactly how the recipe called. No change in any ingredient. It was delicious and a big hit with the family. We made loaves and muffins. Froze the muffins for quick grab to enjoy with coffee. I will definitely use this recipe frequently. Thanks for sharing.

Yip - this really is very good!  I made a half recipe.  Since I don't have 7x3 pans, I put all the batter in a 10x5 pan and cooked it for 1 hr. 25 min. -- perfection!    :o)

I love to add chia seeds and flax seeds to banana bread, along with walnuts.  Healthy and delicious!

This banana bread recipe taste great! My husband  said it was the best banana bread he ever had!  I have to agree.  It took way longer to bake than posted. Next time I will try to bake at 325 instead of 300 and use foil like someone else suggested. I'm not a good baker so I pretty much just followed the recipe - easy and tasty.

I made this recipe because I happened to have both over-ripe bananas and sour cream on hand to use up.  This recipe does make a moist bread, but I found the texture to be rubbery.  I also did not care for the cinnamon.  The cinnamon sugar crust was an interesting idea, but I thought the cinnamon competed with the banana flavor.  I will keep searching for what I think is the best banana bread recipe.

Very good, very rich, beautiful looking banana bread.  I didn't have 3x7 loaf pans so I baked the dough in two standard loaf pans (5x7) for about 90 minutes, turned out great.

OMG!!!! 5 stars just for the smeeeeelll!! It smells SO good while baking. I couldn't even wait for it to cool all the way before I tasted it - that's why my tongue is burning now. Lol. It is absolutely delicious! I cooked it at 325 for just under 50 mins (47 to be exact) and it was perfect! I did do the crumble topping like one other reviewer suggested. My topping did not come out like a crumbly topping at all and ended up just blending in to the bread. I made no changes to the recipe except I halved it. Deeelish

I wasn't "Wow-ed" by this bread but it was  good and fairly moist.  I made no changes other than halving the recipe for 2 loaves instead of 4 ( 1.5 eggs is a bit of a pain). 
My dilemma is that a recipe that "Wows" me, others may not like at all. This bread is a safe bet-- tasty to most. Its a solid recipe and a crowd pleaser.

Amazingly moist and delicious. I make it without the walnuts and love it.  I gave it to people for Christmas and it got 

I'm diabetic and tried it with whole wheat flour and splenda instead of sugar and it was still delicious.

This is delicious banana bread.  I used walnuts and substituted half the white sugar with brown sugar.  I also doubled the vanilla and the cinnamon.  I highly recommend this bread.  It's really moist.

If you double this it will make 2 5x7 pans and 10 of the small 3x5 pans..............I have baked it a little longer, 15 minutes or so, I have also kicked the heat up the last 15 min to 325.  Always works out and everyone loves it.. :-)  I have also added choc. chips and it is very good that way as well...............

The best banana bread I've baked. Moist, rich in flavor. I've added chocolate chip for added flavor. Dont think I need to search for other recipe anymore, will be sticking to this. Thanks for this recipe!!

Moist and delicious! Nothing more to say. 

Didn't have 7X3 pans so I had to fiddle with the time- but that was my own issue! Cooked it at 300 on convection just because I knew it would take longer. Thanks for the recipe!

I was short on sour cream  by 1/4 cup and made up the difference with homemade apple sauce. This was the most moist banana nut bread I have ever made. This recipe will be moved to the front of the box. Thank you so much.

I made this today. I made 2 loaf breads and 12 muffins.
for the muffins I stuffed half a dozen with a cube of dark chocolate, and the other half with peanutbutter chips. came out great! I didn't add walnuts to mine at all. the cake is soft, moist and delicious!

This is by far the best banana bread I've ever tasted. Adding a dusting of the cinnamon sugar mixture on top while it's cooking is the only thing I change to it.

This is, by far, the best banana bread I have ever made.  I divide it into 2 large loaf pans and add extra batter to one mini loaf.   I cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups and it's still plenty sweet.  3 cups is way too much sugar!  I have made it with the sour cream and it's great but I also substituted it with full fat plain yogurt and my family liked the result better.  Everything else I leave the same!  Don't skip out on that sugar/cinnamon dusting of the loaf pans...it adds a nice crusty crunch that's unexpected and delightful!:). Great recipe!

Oh my goodness!  So good!  My 13-year-old BEGS me to make this when she sees that we have some overripe bananas to use up.  I alternate between another recipe, but this is the kids' favorite because of how moist and rich it tastes with the sour cream in it. (And they say they HATE sour cream, haha!)  I have added things to it on occasion ... blueberries, apples, etc.  They all taste really great together!  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Very Good!  I only added used 2 cups of sugar, and it was still divine. I subbed one 1/2 cup apple sauce for 1/2 butter.  I optioned 1 cup of pecans.  Made 1 reg. loaf and a cake size loaf.  Larger loaf had to cook 15 min. longer.

I've made this recipe at least 4 times.  It is one of the best banana bread recipes I've made.  Everyone loves it.  I've also made a variation where I put 1-1/2 cups of pecans and 1 cup of amaretto. The couple of large loafs that it makes goes quickly at our holiday gatherings.

made as written except that I used 1/4 cup of apple sauce and 1/2 cup butter instead of 3/4 cup butter. I baked it in three cake pans - - tastes like a banana cake - lighter than banana bread.  I baked it at 325 for about an hour - I kept checking it after 40 minutes.  the cinnamon/sugar crust was a nice touch!

This was the best banana bread I ever made by far! I did cut the recipe in half and it made 30 muffins. Baked 300 degrees  for 25 minutes. I also sprinkled the cinnamon and sugar on top and added some crush walnuts on top.

This was my first attempt at a banana bread and I absolutely love it!!!!! It was moist and indeed melted in your mouth. After reading the reviews however, I decided to tweek the recipe a bit. I substituted the 3/4 cup butter with 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup oil and instead of 3 tsp baking soda, I used 2 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp baking powder. Took less than an hour to bake so I didn't experience the issues other reviewers had with the uncooked middle..... My only issue is that 3 cups sugar is wayyyy too much so in ny next attempt, I'm cutting that down to 1 1/2 cups seeing as the bananas have a sweetness of its own.

Great recipe.  I used the tips by SaraLady19 in the top review.  I made one-half of the recipe, 2 loaf; the time and temperature she recommended, and the topping.  Fantastic recipe, a real keeper.

I split the dough in half and made 2 loaves with nuts and 2 without. Everyone preferred the bread without nuts. Personally I think it baked better without the nuts.

wow.. right on!! I've never made banana bread, not much of baker, my husband request it because we had very ripped banana wasting away in fruit basket..  found this and best part about  this recipe was so simple and had all ingredients on hand (except for walnut,  which I don't care for).. he came home to a very warm fresh out of the oven bread.. after a scout hike with my son and he said "best banana bead ever"... I was rather impressed with myself... I think the cinnamon sugarcoating was my favorite part .. enjoy..

My new go-to banana bread recipe!  I halved the recipe and it made one very large loaf... and three very large muffins (from the 6 muffin pan).  Might even have been able to do 4 muffins.  Loaf took right around an hour, and I pulled the muffins around 45 min.  (Maybe slightly less time on the muffins next time.)  Otherwise, made exactly as written - and delicious!  2/10/2016: Eating one loaf that we had frozen from the fall - amazing!  Have to say it again... probably the best banana bread I've ever had.  So moist, lots of flavor.

I have tried it twice. Both times they were raw and had to cook longer. I love the taste but will keep trying with bigger loaf pans and turn up temp.

The 2nd time I made a double batch he end up takeing some to school for lunch andshared it. Next thing I know I got teenagers bringing me banana and saying please can you make us some its so much better than our moms.

THE BEST BANANA BREAD!!!  I have made this recipe twice and it is quite delicious!!!  My friends and family just love it.  I can't make it fast enough.  They keep asking when I'll be baking it again.  The only thing I did different was I added a teaspoon of banana extract to the ingredients.  I still put in the 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract as the recipe calls for.  I wanted to be sure the banana flavor would be there.  It was perfect, just the right amount of banana flavor.  I did turn the oven up to 325 degrees and lengthened the cooking time to an hour and fifteen minutes because I used larger loaf pans. You may have to adjust cooking time according to your own oven.   This is the best banana bread recipe I've ever tasted.  It is so moist and please don't omit the dusting of the pans with the cinnamon and sugar mixture because it gives the bottom and sides of the loaf added flavor.

I have made this recipe several times and it's a BIG hit when I do. This bread is sooo moist without being too sweet. I do not make any changes to the recipe, except to add choc chips to a portion of it at times, depending on who I'm making it for. I have also used part of the recipe for small loaves and part of it for muffins. The muffins are easier to ship to my kids in college. The kids LOVE getting that surprise and the muffins stay moist for many days. If you love banana bread I highly recommend this recipe as its written

I added nutmeg and ground cloves.  People noticed those flavors.

There is far too much sugar in here though.  You could cut it back to 1.5 cups or 2 cups, but not 3!  Darn it.  I just made 8 loaves of sugar bread!

I have been making this banana bread for years and haven't used any other recipes since.  Everyone loves this recipe!!  My daycare children will even bring me bananas so that I will make it and they can take some home!  I put bananas in the freezer when they start to get a little to ripe for eating then I take them out and let them defrost in the refrigerator.  Yes they will look so nasty but they are extra sweet and make the most amazing banana bread.  I read one of the comments on the recipe about the baking time and the temp of the oven.  I honestly don't ever set the timer...i just test the loaves with a cake tester until it is done.  I also wrap the loaves in plastic wrap after they cool and the become so moist and irresistible.
Hope my post was helpful!!

My family LOVED this bread! The only thing I added was a zucchini (only because I needed to used it up). I shreaded 1 zucchini and it came to around 2 cups. Through that in baked it at 350 degrees and Walla SUPER TASTY delish bread!

Healthier version & just like my mother made:
This turns out even better if you substitute 2 of the cups of white flour with whole wheat flour (leaving 2 1/2 cups as white.)  And if you also replace 1 cup of the white sugar with dark brown sugar, it tastes deeper, richer.  325 degrees between 50 mins & 1 hr 10 minutes, depending on loaf pan size.  I used all medium & small, no full size pans. Don't fill pans too full, since this is dense bread.  Refrigerate loaves.  Tastes gourmet!

I have made this very recipe many times now and my family LOVES it.  Only thing I change is to use GF flour for the girls.  And I use some fresh bananas as well.  Mix it up.  My family LOVES this recipe!  And there's another batch going into the oven shortly.

This is my go to banana bread recipe now. The only change I make is I cut the sugar in half and bake it in 3 larger loaf pans rather than 4 smaller ones. Overall great recipe!

I just love this recipe, moist and delicious and what a bonus!!  Freezes well and for the same amount of work, you get 4 loaves instead of one! The sour cream adds that little extra something that sets this recipe apart from any others I have tried. I don't throw over-ripe bananas out any more, or feel pressed to bake when I really don't have time. I just throw them in the freezer until I'm in a baking mood!! Superb!

Moist and delicious! Not too sweet which I really liked but at 300 degrees it took an extra 15 minutes for perfection. When my son tasted it he closed his eyes in bliss and moaned, this recipe will be going into my box.

Loved it! I added Chocolate Chips to mine a and it tasted amazing! I also put 4 cups of flour instead of 4 1/2 so my banana bread was a lot more moist. This recipe is definitely a keeper! :)

ABSOLUTELY EXCELLENT---I GRIND MY OWN CINNAMON AND I USE VANILLA FROM MEXICO--I USED PECANS BECAUSE I GROW THEM AND THEY ARE A TEXAS STAPLE--OKAY SO IT NEEDS TO COOK 2 HOURS AT THREE HUNDRED DEGREES--THIS IS THE MOST MOIST, FLAVORFUL BANANA BREAD I'VE EVER TASTED---BLESS YOU FOR SHARING.

By far my favorite banana bread recipe. I have made it countless times and it always turns out great. I do substitute sour cream for plain low fat Greek yogurt because I always have it in my fridge.

My husband made this banana bread.  He is really the backer in the house.  It was outstanding.  We gave the loaves to a sick friend and it was a welcomed treat for them.  It was moist, not undercooked.  I always check my oven temp before I use it.  I always eyeball and toothpick test before I take anything out of the oven.  This bread baked in a little more than an hour, but I checked it every 8 minutes or so there after. We did use regular loaf pans and recipe made 2 loaves. This will be my go to recipe for banana bread.  Thanks for sharing Esther! and Thanks SaraLady19 for the info on pan and time changes.

Didn't change a single thing and loved it! Made 3 loaves and medium sized muffins. Baked everything together for exactly 60 min @ 300. Everything was perfect and my family loved it. Highly recommend this recipe.

The recipe as written is great. To cut down on some of the fat I substituted yogurt for the sour cream. I have used plain,vanilla and peach flavored yogurt..all were loved by my family. You might want to cut back on the sugar if you use a flavored/sweetened yogurt. When I used the pea h yogurt I I cut back 1 banana and used some diced canned peaches in place of that banana.

Delicious! Made only half the recipe since we only had 3 overripe bananas. Followed SaraLady19's  review minus the nuts (didn't have any) this was so moist and delicious, even without nuts, baked in a large loaf pan. It took about a little over an hour to bake. My 5 year old loved it so much he was asking for it as snack and  then as a dessert after lunch. This just become our favorite banana bread recipe, we will be making this again with or without nuts either way its delicious. Thank you Esther Nelson!

The best banana bread I have ever had, bar none. For best results, stay close while baking and use the toothpick test as you go. I ended up making 6 muffins, a cake pan loaf, and a standard loaf all at once so staying close was essential. I never would have put sour cream in banana bread but now I plan to use this recipe exclusively!

I just made this recipe. It's my first time making banana bread and it came out amazing! Great light and fluffy texture, and great flavor as well! I made it without walnuts and cut the servings in half. Will definitely be making this often!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it turned out perfectly. I did tent the loaves with foil for the last 15 minutes to prevent over-browning. I have other banana bread recipes, but they're getting sent to the back of the recipe box. This is now my go-to recipe for banana bread. I made it into small loaves which are the perfect size for gifts.

Followed recipe exactly so I could review and rate it. This was a great bread. Not sweet bread, it's the sugar sprinkle that's sweet, if you left if off you would not be saying its sweet.   A bit dense but moist.

THIS is the BEST banana bread recipe EVER!!! I typically make one bread in my pampered chef fluted pan and make one loaf to give away.  Hubby eats this bread like it is going out of style! Says it is the best banana bread he has ever had! I do not make any changes to the recipe but sometimes have to cook it a little longer.  Thanks for an AWESOME recipe!!!

This was a great recipe.  I've made banana bread in the past, several recipes all pretty tasty.  This was the first time I used sour cream in making banana bread, and I was pleasantly surprised how well it turned out.   I did very slightly tweak the recipe after reading reviews especially SaraLady19's.  

-- 1.  I used 1tsp cinnamon & 1tsp all spice --- 2. I turned this into muffins (made 3.5 - 4dz regular sized muffins).  --- 3. I did bake at 325 for 20-25 for muffins.  --- 4.  I used the electric beater, and loved having a lighter cake fluffy muffin which Sara Lady did mention would happen.   --- 5. I mixed in pb chips, and chocolate chips into some of the muffins after I made 2dz regular ones.---6. I made the crumble topping SaraLady19 mentioned (it was very good!) 

-- Side Note: make sure you use a really large bowl, I had to transfer before adding in the flour to a very large bowl I use when making bread.  --

This banana bread was amazing! Only problem was that I had to leave the loafs in for two hours a piece instead of an hour. But after that they were one of the best I have ever had.

I am 59 and just learning how to cook from scratch. This recipe was easy to put together, had ingredients I already had, and was so moist! Instead of loaves, I made muffins in the large tins(like SAMs club), and baked them for 30 min. I quartered the original recipe since there are only two of us, and used an egg from my Banty hens for 3/4 of an egg! ;) they cooked up fluffy and moist! Thank you! This is a winner in my book!

This was so yummy. The Sour Cream makes it so moist but you can't taste the sour cream or i couldn't. It s easy and did not last long at all.

Best Banana Bread that I have ever had! The best part is that the longer you have it the more moist it gets!

Really easy recipe and makes a lot! I ended up with 6 mini loafs and 14 muffins. Adjusted cooking time for smaller quantities and I dusted the tops with cinnamon and sugar mixture also as I had a lot left over.

I swear, every bread recipe that claims to be the moistest lets me down.  This was a fine recipe, but it tasted just like every other banana bread I've ever tried and was just as dry as the Better Homes and Gardens recipe I have been using for years.  I'm not sure that I'd waste money on the sour cream in this recipe since I don't think the result was any better than any other run-of-the-mill banana bread recipe.

I did notice the "not creaming together" thing at the beginning, but ignored it. I only made two loaves but it took about an hour and a half to cook all the way through.  After the first original hour, I'd check on them every 10-15 minutes.  Every time I put a bitter knife in the center it was doughy. Waited another 10-15 minutes etc. Until it wasn't any longer. This is the best! I will make it over and over again! !

According to my boyfriend and my brother this is the best banana bread I've made, ever!  My brother took some to his work and his coworkers asked him if I was married.  For the single ladies out there, impress your crush with this recipe! I added a whole package of semi sweet chocolate chip 11.5 oz to the cake - I think that is what pushed this cake to perfection.

Best banana bread recipe.  Made it twice and awesome both times!  I added chocolate chips.  Amazing!  I made the recipe at high altitude (8300 ft)  and it still came out great.

I always use my great aunt's recipe, but I couldn't find it.  Instead, I found this and I will never use another recipe again.  It was delicious.  I used 9 medium bananas, because I had them.  Delicious!   Everyone I shared the bread with asked for more.   Sooooo good!

I halved the recipe and made one loaf and 12 small muffins in cupcake papers. I sprinkles the sugar/cinnamon on the tops when they came out of the oven. The small muffins were done in 35-40 minutes and the loaf was done at 50 minutes. Really moist and tasty recipe!

This is the only banana bread recipe that is moist and fresh-tasting the next day, although it rarely makes it to the next day.  The sour cream keeps the bread moist, and adds exceptional flavor.  I have a small family of 3, so I made only a third of the original recipe.  This made one loaf, and 4 nice sized banana muffins.  To top off this recipe, I added a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, which was a splendid idea, if I don't say so myself ;)  I used real butter to grease my pans, and sprinkled on the sugar mixture which makes the sweetest most delectable crust ever!!!  I will use this from now on in all of my breads and pastries.  I must go have a slice now...  Thank you for this javascript:void(0);wonderfully tasty and moist recipe!!  One more thing...  I have substituted the sour cream with greek yogurt when I ran out of sour cream, and the results are great, as well!  Great way to add protein to my meat-hating children.

this recipe is a great hit I am making it again only after one week I did take some notes from saralady19 and baked them at 325 1hr 10 - 15min. I had to keep checking it because like dlpalma the centers didn't want to bake. you need to watch how much you put in the pan, it will double in size once it is done. the first one I poured took forever to get done. I made it way to thick. we will see how they turn out to day. :)

This was the best banana bread recipe I've ever had.  It was moist and delicious.  Dusting the pan with the cinnamon and sugar gave it a nice touch.  It was a big hit at my ladies' Bible study class.  I don't need to search for any other banana bread recipes.  It's a keeper.

This is the BEST recipe for banana bread that I've ever tried...and I've tried a lot. I only had 4 small bananas and an 8 oz tub of sour cream, so I cut the whole recipe in half. I used all 4 bananas because they were REALLY small, and 2 eggs instead of 3. Even cut in half I was able to make 2 full size bread loaves of banana bread.

I love this recipe.  I've made it a lot.  I cook it at 300 deg for an hour and 10 min.  I also add ground cloves and nutmeg to it. MMMMMMMM. After cooking, I let it sit in the 4 pans that I separated it into for a good 30 min.  Then take out of pans to finish cooling.  After cool, wrap in tinfoil.

best banana bread I have baked. every banana bread I've ever tried comes out under baked in the middle and this one does too unless you leave each loaf in an extra 10-15 min….. but the flavor is incredible and better than any other I've tried. Especially like the recommendation to sugar/cinnamon coat the loaf pans.

I made this recipe today. Made two larger loaves though so I baked at 325 for 1 hour and 25 minutes. Was concerned about burning and there was a little "dampness" on the toothpick so I shut off the oven and left the door open about 10 minutes before I put on my cooling rack. Bread came out fantastic, not only in color and texture, but taste... Great recipe, thanks!

It's a really great banana bread recipe!  Made the four loaves and 8 hours later we're down to two.  I did add a couple dashes of ground cloves and sprinkled the cinnamon sugar on top and bottom before baking.  Also, baked at 325 for about 50 minutes for perfectly done loaves.  Didn't have any walnuts on hand, so made without and missed out on the added crunch.

Really great recipe and easy to make for a first time cook.  I really like the lining of the pan with the sugar and cinnamon.  It came out a little heavier than I would've liked and may cut back on the butter a but but overall very yummy.

This recipe was practically perfect. The only thing I did differently was I used a pan that made a lot of smaller loafs, which turned out fantastic. I was concerned towards the beginning of making these,but they are absolutely great. Even my little brother loved them.

Made it for my sisters-in-law and they loved it. So did my family. Have wanted more since the last piece was gone. Since that first time, I've made this recipe more times than I can count. It's probably my favorite recipe on this site.

Used whole-wheat flour and brown sugar. A little yogurt instead of all sour cream since I didn't have full amount.

I accidentally made this recipe to perfection. My son was very demanding and I forgot a few steps during the process. I made 6 muffins with left over batter. When I realized I forgot the vanilla and cinnamon I added it to the loaves. Left the muffins in the oven. The muffins were perfect and loaves, not so much. In the future, I'll make this a muffin or mini loaf recipe.

I baked this, brought it into work, and it was a major HIT! There were many compliments about the moistness and the rich banana flavor. Am making it again right now!

I only had 2 bananas so had to cut this recipe in thirds. Also used 4 small foil loaf pans (the kind you get in your Christmas goody basket from Aunt Edna) instead of larger loaf pans & since I'd read several reviews that said this recipe was too sweet I sprayed & floured them instead of using the cinnamon sugar mixture to coat them. 
The banana bread turned out moist, tender & flavorful. I like it a lot & will absolutely make this again. Maybe for my Christmas goody baskets....:D
Making it again tonight. Had 3 bananas this time so I did 1/2 recipe this time & used 2 loaf pans size 3 X 7. I can tell I'll be making this a lot.

This IS the best! Tastes like the kind my grandma made.  Very moist, flavorful.  I didn't use any crumb topping, we liked it just as it was. I took advice from others and baked it at 325 for 1 hour and about 10 minutes.

I am sorry but I did not like this at all.  It was way too sweet, the cinnamon was overwhelming and it was dry.  I don't know.  I followed the recipe to the letter but it just did not work out for me.

I used four bananas and only 2 cups of sugar. Also added a dash of ground cloves and nutmeg. It made three large (8x4) loaves and baked on 350 for 1hr and 25 min. My crew loves it!!

It was way too sweet and completely gummy.  I realized after making it that 6 bananas and 2 c sour cream is way too much liquid  for only 4 c flour.

This recipe is just insanely good. I could eat the batter all day… which is probably good that this makes A TON of batter! My only change is to slightly cut back on the sugar because I like my sweets a little less sweet. I cut back by about 3/4 cup this time and I thought it was perfect. Melts in your mouth. I brought it to a brunch and it was gone in minutes and everyone at the party kept asking where it came from.

I have made this recipe several times and it is by far the absolute banana bread ever! It is so moist and the cinnamon sugar coating really kicks it up a notch! My family and coworkers always rave about it and it is gone in no time. I will usually freeze a couple of the loaves and they are just as yummy when they are thawed.This recipe is a keeper for sure!

It turned out beautifully! I made two batches and made six loaves. My family loved it and had to stop themselves from eating it all! I made it exactly according to the recipe only I put the oven on 350 for an hour.

Fantastic!  The best banana bread ever.  I cut the recipe in half and made 2 loaves.  I cut the butter to 1/4 cup and the sugar to 1/2 cup... You don't need all that sugar and butter... Everything else was cut in half, except for 2 eggs and 2/3 cup walnuts.  I cooked it at 325 for 1 hour + 2 minutes.  I immediately took the loaves out of the pans and cooled on a rack.  Outstanding!  I don't give that rating lightly.

Loved it! I use greek yogurt instead of the sour cream and it is still so delishious and moist! I have to make double batches (8 loaves!) so my family doesn't fight over who gets to take a loaf home.

Great recipe.  I made some large loaf so I increased the temp to 325 as someone suggested because I did not want a doughy center.  They came out beautiful.  I would just change the cinnamon/sugar grease pan coat to just a greased/flour coat because the sugar tends to cook quicker than the bread itself, increasing the chance of over doneness on the outside.  Overall a super moist and delicious bread.  It yields quite a bit doughy batter so hope you have a really large bowl.  It helps to cream the sugar/butter in a processor and combine the dry ingredients in a separate bowl, of course.  Wet and banana ingredients were in a third bowl.  Combine all of the ingredients in a super large bowl.

It made 3 large loaf pans and 9 muffins.  Do the loaves, I did have to leave them in the oven for about 80 minutes.  Use the toothpick or a knife to check the center of your bread for sure. Bread comes out delicious and super moist.

I'm not sure what went wrong, followed the directions, the flavor is wonderful, but the exterior got overcooked while the inside is still very gooy a raw gooy. The exterior very dry an crumbly

This is the best and most moist banana bread I've ever tasted!! I just added 1 teaspoon of nutmeg and it only took 45 minutes in metal pans but 60 minutes in glass pans.

I prepared these as directed, but only ended up with enough for three loaves. My pans were not all the same size. Anyhow, this is the best banana bread I've ever made! I love the sugar/cinnamon coating. It gives it that extra something. Perfection!

Wonderful recipe. I cut the recipe in half (but using 2 eggs) and used one 9x5 ceramic loaf pan. At 300, I found that I had to bake for about 1 hour 45 minutes (possibly due to ceramic vs. metal). Following other suggestions I topped with a cinnamon crumble (sugar, cinnamon, flour, butter)  before baking and it melted into the middle of the loaf making it even more delicious. I found that dusting the loaf pan with sugar and cinnamon after greasing, not only gave it a crisp outer edge, but also helped it to slide right out of the pan. Thank you for the recipe. Definitely one I will make again.

The reviews on this had me nervous. So many mentioned it not baking evenly, having a mushy middle, bad consistency, etc. I followed the recipe closely, changing only the amount of sugar (2 cups instead of 3). I used two large loaf pans - 11+ by 5+ because that's all I had on hand (EZfoil). One hour and 10 minutes later, perfect banana bread - perfect consistency, fabulous taste. All in all, very easy to make and totally worth it.

Great recipe. I didn't have sour cream on hand so swapped in Hellman's mayo. In one , I added 1 cup of dried cranberriies. This is the moistest banana bread and PACKED with flavour. Definitely a new family favourite!!!

I am so picky about banana bread after tasting the perfect one 20 yrs ago and never getting the recipe; I knew it had sour cream though.   I only had 4 bananas & no sour cream so used 18 oz of my plain, homemade tart yogurt hoping the extra yogurt would make up for the missing bananas and followed the reviewer with 2 larger pans at 325 for a little over an hour and foil covered the last 20.  This is the recipe I've been searching for - so moist, so yummy!  Thank you!!!

Wet.  Cooked it at 325 degrees for close to 80 mins. and I still ended up with a gloppy mess.  A sample from the cooked edge of the loaf revealed a rich flavor, however.

Excellent flavor and texture.  Make sure you don't over bake this recipe.  I made a third of a recipe (2 bananas, 1 egg, worked out) and baked it in a regular loaf pan and it fit fine.

Awesome recipe, I made this exactly as written, and the second time i made it i made i wanted a more healthy banana bread so i made these adjustments, I used only whole wheat flour, I added 3 TBS of ground flax seeds, 1 teaspoon of nutmeg,  extra 1/4 teaspoon of salt because of the whole wheat flour, an extra banana ( be sure to use really brown banana's ) and kept the rest of the ingredients the same.  Awesome Awesome! My husband who can't stand it when I use whole wheat flour didn't even notice the difference!

Unbelievable!  I made it with the recipe and Saralady19's tweaks.  Brought one loaf to a friend as a thank you and another to work and now I have multiple people asking me when I am going to make banana bread again.  The one change I made to Saralady 19's tweak was that I baked the bread for 10-15 minutes, then added the topping so the topping would stay set on top.  I froze the batter for the other two loaves and baked them later.  They come out great - as if I just mixed them up.  Simply put the frozen batter in the refrigerator the night before and allow it to thaw naturally, then bake the next day.

Right on! This is a wonderful recipe. I added a few dashes of cinnamon and one more banana. I made these into muffins and baked a dozen muffins at 350 for 14 minutes. Double the ingredients and you'll have 4 dozen  to share. Just lovely!

I tried this recipe as given and it did not bake completely.  Thought about it for awhile and wondered if the 16 oz container of sour cream was by weight not volume.  so not 2 cups of sour cream but more like 1 cup.

All I did different was add one extra banana as I would have had nothing more to do with it other than throw it away and it turned out AMAZING!!!  YUMMY!  I got 2 large loaves and 12 muffin cups out of it.  I also added a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the muffins.  Will definitely use this recipe again!!!  :)

For alterations, I have been known to substitute pecans for the walnuts, or even do without if no nuts are on hand. I normally bake at 300 degrees for 70 minutes in two 16 inch Pullman loaf pans. I could easily scale the recipe to 1 1/2 size with these pans but the mixer is maxed out already! Time for a bigger Kitchenaid!

This recipe is fantastic. I used only a little of the cinnamon sugar to dust the pans, then sprinkled the remainder on the top of the batter. I only had 10 inch loaf pans, so I made two loaves and baked them at 325 degrees for 70 minutes.  Turned out perfectly.

I have made this recipe twice now and it is so good. I made some for Easter, everyone loved it and took some home. I had plenty because it makes two loaves plus a small loaf! I'm sure glad I found this one, thanks Esther!

Absolutely delicious!  I reduced the ingredients to 8 servings (the only things I altered was using 1 full egg and I only had 1 banana), this made one loaf. Very soft and moist, the best I made and ate.

Awesome recipe!  So versatile, too!  I actually 1/2 the recipe and got one loaf of bread and 12 muffins.  I did 1 1/4 cups regular flour and 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour.  I also threw in about 1/4 cup wheat germ and 1/4 cup flax seed.  You can't even tell...delicious!

I thought it was a good recipe. I made part of it in my Pampered Chef mini loaves pan and they stuck rely badly. I baked those for 45 min. Then I made the rest in my larger loaf pan (glass) and it popped out beautifully. 
I also raised the temp to 325 for my baking and being at high altitude, added two Tbsp of flour.

I made a few changes to this recipe after a few disastrous results and and some small flavor tweaks. When I used 4 small loaf pans like the directions called for, my loaves ran over the top (not due to overfilling, believe me!), took extra time to bake, but when they did, my goodness, they divine! I baked

Great recipe and the sour cream makes it really moist. May be my oven but I need mine in the oven longer than suggested. Very yummy though.

Best banana bread I've ever made!! I used 7 bananas and 1 1/2 cups brown sugar and 1 1/2 white. The bake time did take 30 mins longer and loaves didn't rise to the top of the pan. It was super moist. Next time I will adjust for high altitude and turn the temp up. My family loved it!

This is the best banana bread Ive ever tasted. However, every time I make it the cook time varies and I never know if it will turn out mushy, dry or just right. Who has a 7 x 3" loaf pan? Trying to guesstimate how much bake time is needed is frustrating and i never get it just right. Reviewers on the site suggest increasing the temperature to 325 degrees and/or extending the bake time. I wish the owner of this recipe would rewrite it using the more common 8 x 4" or 9 x 5" loaf pans and adjust the time and temp accordingly. Yes, I know about using a cake tester. 
Sorry about the 3 stars but trying to figure out when the loaves are done is always a shot in the dark.

3.5 stars. I halved the recipe for my 9 inch square pan (cooked for just over an hour) and used 1 cup whole wheat flour & 1.25 cup AP flour. Added a handful of whole pecans which I could take or leave. I also added a handful of large dark chocolate chips and I would definitely add chocolate chips next time, milk or dark.

I only had 3 bananas so I halved the recipe and made 2 standared loaves.  Since my Wilton pans are darker, I baked them on 300 degrees for about one hour and 15 minutes.  I was planning on keeping one and taking one to work, key word being WAS.  After tasting it my loaf, I threw that bad boy in the freezer to keep for myself!  The cinnamon sugar mixture on the pan added a sweet, slightly crunchy texture to the outside and the sour cream gives it a little extra richness.  This is the banana bread recipe I've been searching for all my life.

The flavour is just wonderful! I wanted to follow LINDABTX changes but didn't have all the ingredients so I just changed: 3/4 cup of butter for 4TB butter and 1/2 cup of apple sauce. 
Just amazing! Next time I will try: less 2TB of butter and about half the sugar (I usually do that with most recipes as we don't have a sweet tooth in this house). Oh I also added some chocolate chips, YUM!

This banana bread was a bit sweet for my taste so if I ever try this one again I will cut down the sugar.  It also needs to cook higher and longer in my oven at 325 degrees for 80 minutes using half the batter in a 9x5 glass loaf pan.  Decrease the sugar level by 1/4 whether you bake one loaf or two.

I loved this banana nut bread. It is the best I've tasted. It does come out moist and a little sweet, but since I have a sweet tooth, there's not a problem for me there. It's better than the store bought. I've made this recipe a couple of times already.Easy to make. My family loved it...they keep asking me to make it for the holiday. I would recommend 1st timers to give it a try :) as indicated by another fan of this bread, I do cover it with aluminum foil for the last 20 minutes. Thank you so much Esther Nelson for sharing this recipe with us :)

I do not cook often but I have been trying to do more lately.  This was a VERY easy recipe to follow and everyone in my house loved it! I had so much that I took some to my parents and they loved it too.  The only thing that I changed was add cranberries, almonds and chocolate chips.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Followed the recipe...came out great, and, in addition to providing for a nice snack for fam (and friends), I cut up one of the loaves, and used it next morning, to make French Toast (along with a side of bacon)...which was also very well received!

Everyone loved this.  So moist and delicious.  I almost didn't add the walnuts, but I'm glad I did.

Amazing! I used all whole wheat flour just because its all I had. Also  GREEK YOGURT instead of sour cream again because it was what I had. It taste so good and this is easy to do cupcakes. I cooked them for 35 mins at 300.

I made this with only maybe 1/2 cup brown sugar and whole wheat bread flour, 2 extra bananas and it turned out fabulous!  moist and not dense and more naturally sweetened.  Lovely recipe!

The ingredient combination is delicious but the TEMPERATURE is off on this recipe. It should be 325 F. I baked mine for 1 hr and 5 minutes at 325 F and it was my perfect, which is a soft bake but done in the center. 

Also, I added chocolate chips and pecans....yum!

I love this recipe. Only gave it 4 stars because it was tpp sweet for me. I have made this several times and it always turns out beautifully, even with reduced sugar. I made it tonight, but forgot to get sour cream, so used greek yogurt instead. Results? Just as good as sour cream.

This has to be "the best" banana bread recipe that I have ever come across and I've made a lot of banana bread over the years.  So moist it melts in your mouth.  Big hit with family and friends over the holidays.  I haven't had any problems with this recipe at all and have made it a couple of times already. Making some again today.  :)

Used half brown and half white sugar and 7 small bananas. 
Made 4 small loafs and one large loaf that were extremely full. Dusting the pans with cinnamon sugar made for sweet bottoms and easy removal from pans! Warning the original recipe makes a lot of batter so make sure you use a very large bowl! The large loaf took about 1hr 15 mins to bake. Will make this recipe again!

make sure not to completely mix dry ingredients to wet like you would a cake. Instead use the muffin method; make a ''well'' in the centre of the dry ingredients, add the wet, and gently fold just until the wet ingredients coat the dry. you want to make sure you have lumps of flour, not smooth. over mixing causes a dry, tough, odd shaped product. I learned this from my friend. Excellent bread!!

This is delicious.  This year we "made" Christmas.  I made a loaf of this bread to add to every relative's gift basket and for each of my child's teachers (I did mini loaves for my son's teachers as he is in middle school and we had a LOT of teachers, assistant teachers and administrators) - we also made chocolate drizzled popcorn.  Because we made SO much of this recipe, I froze the loaves until we were ready to make the baskets.  They freeze/thaw out nicely.  I will do this again next year.  We got so many compliments on it.  I did what the other reviewer suggested and added a topping: brown sugar (1/2 cup), flour (1/2 cup) and walnuts (1/3 cup), 3 tbsp butter and 1 tsp cinnamon mixed and crumbled over top of bread to bake.  When I ran out of tins I had some pretty tulip shaped muffin tins and I made some of those, too... they puffed up beautifully.  I am on my way to make more of this now for breakfast tomorrow.  YUM!

this is a good recipe and almost identical to my grandmothers,
I used pecans as my grandma did and I increased the temperature to 325 degrees and cooked this an additional 20 minutes. I also have a propane stove which makes a difference.anyway needless to say this turned out very good , I can remember my grandmother adding extra cooking time when she used heavier batters such as this one.

We always end up waiting too long to eat our bananas, so I use them by trying different banana bread recipes each time. I just happened to have three very ripe bananas and all the ingredients at home, so I cut this recipe in half and made two loaves. They were so delicious and moist, I won't need to search for another banana bread recipe; it was a hit with the whole family! No nuts included (hubby hates them).

Tried this and turned out perfect. Crusty on the outside and bread like consistency inside. I adjusted the serving size to 10 (roughly 1/3rd) as I only had 2 bananas.  From  the reviews, I also added a pinch of nutmeg. I baked it in one 4" X 12" pan at 300 for 60 minutes.

Absolutely delicious! However, I've got some tweaks. Since I had slightly larger pans (9"x4.5") I had to alter my cook time/temp. I ended up putting them in at the 300° for 80min, then an additional 30min @ 325°. It was a bit hard on the exposed crest at the top, but still moist and delicious throughout.

Fabulous!  Made them in Christmas tree molds instead of pans.  Added nutmeg, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Absolutely fabulous!

Very good banana bread.  Easy to make.  Baked very evenly and my husband loved it.  He's going for seconds as I am writing!  I personally wonder if I prefer a firmer texture and a little less sweet.  It's a matter of preference.

Very good! I followed the recipe exactly. Be careful not to fill the pans too much, the bread will rise quite a bit. It may be because I am high altitude that my pans overflowed, but maybe not, so be careful. I did 1-1/2 the recipe and baked some in mini loaf pans and some in large pans. If you do 1-1/2 the recipe, make sure you have a VERY big mixing bowl, I mean VERY big! The cooking time was considerably more for large pans, but that is to be expected. Very good recipe, no need to "tweak".

We love this recipe. I usually do cookies for my father and husband for Christmas to take to work but this year I am WAY to pregnant to mess with all that. So I thought I would do bread instead. I followed the recipe for the most part. I used 3 tsps of vanilla instead of 2 and used pecans instead of walnuts ( I have never had walnuts in banana bread ). 

I used a mini loaf pan instead of regular sized loaf pans and baked for 18-20 minutes. I re greased the pan and dusted with the sugar and cinnamon mixture for each batch and used about 1/4 of a cup batter for each mini loaf cavity. These came out prefect sized to fit into little treat bags after they cooled completely. They are absolutely delicious: very moist, not to sweet.

I didn't believe this recipe would be any different than my previous favourite banana bread recipe. I was very wrong. This recipe is perfectly balanced. It is light, tasty, and by far the best banana bread I've ever made. I made a few changes but I am sure it would be just as good without them. I substituted greek yogurt for sour cream, added a 1/8 tsp of cloves and a 1/4 tsp of baking powder. I added the powder because I prefer a less dense bread. I regret not trying this recipe years ago... so just go ahead and make it and enjoy. Thanks for the great recipe!

I did not read any other reviews prior to making this Banana Sour Cream Bread or prior to writing this review. 

I only utilized 5 bananas as that is what I had on hand, and that was perfectly appropriate. I used real vanilla extract with the actual vanilla beans in it, which gives the bread tiny bits of crunch (much like poppy seeds). I did use walnuts. I did not have 7 x 3 bread pans, so I used Wilton Professional 9 x 5 pans. I did have to bake the loaves for approximately 40 minutes longer (nearly 1.75 hourS) to get them to come out appropriately at the same temperature setting. I should have turned up the heat.

Regardless, the bread was absolutely wonderful, moist, tasty and I will make it again, likely in 9 x 5 loaves. I took it to a potluck, and it was a hit. The recipe makes a large volume of bread (Two huge, very full 9 x 5 loaves).

This is the best recipe I came across for banana bread!  It was dense and delicious.  I made mini muffins, everyone raves over them!  Only change is I double the spices.

I made 2 loaves cutting the recipe in half. Used 2 eggs and cooked at 325 for 50 minutes. As other reviewers suggested, I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of cloves. It was fantastic!!! Not dry and so flavorful. Will make this again.

I didn't add the cinnamon, as I think that it would cover up the BANANA taste. I sprinkled brown sugar on top before baking...that was a good trick. It turned out very well. Super MOIST and we LOVE it! :)

I only had five very ripe bananas instead of the six the recipe calls for.  I didn't have quite enough sour cream either and made up the difference with fat free Greek yogurt.  Even with these variations, the recipe came out absolutely perfect!  I made a dozen muffins, one 8x8 pan, a large loaf and a small loaf.  Even though I had to watch the stove with the various baking times, they all came out perfect!  I froze the loaves for future use.  Great recipe!

Even the banana bread 'haters' in my life love this bread! There's something magical about the addition of sour cream, along with the crunchy cinnamon-sugar outside, that makes this the perfect texture. I'm no expert baker, and someone had stolen a couple of my loaf pans, so I made two loaves and 12 muffins and clearly had different baking times going on. Also, I mixed in mini chocolate chips to half the muffins and one loaf of bread, and wished I had done more of that. My kids called them Amazing Chocolate Chip Banana Cinnamon Crunch muffins and are fighting over the last ones as I type!

This is by far the BEST Banana Bread I have ever eaten!  I took some loaves to work and after requests for me to make more and more and more, I now have printed it out and shared this delicious recipe!  Thank You!

I did make a crumb topping like suggested using -1 cup packed brown sugar -1 cup all-purpose flour -5 to 6 tablespoons butter or margarine -2 teaspoon cinnamon -2/3 cup chopped walnuts or pecans and put it on the top of the loaves before baking and it was PHENOMENAL!

I followed the recipe exactly and thought that it could use a few adjustments. I thought that there could have been more banana taste, I would have used about 8 very ripe bananas instead of 6. It could have used more sugar as well, maybe 3/4 or a whole cup. Other than those few adjustments, the texture was great and the chopped nuts and sour cream was a nice touch. I hope this helps!!

The only reason I'm giving this a 4* is because I think a few things in the recipe need to be tweaked.  I added, (Mexican)vanilla, allspice and a hint of nutmeg and 2 drop of lemon  to the recipe.  Instead of baking @ 300 I chose 350 and cut the baking time down by about 15 mins.  Other than that the recipe comes out perfect everytime.  Also I do this recipe in batches of two using two full eggs instead of 1 1/2.I also bake it in the oven over a cookie sheet with water. It comes out very moist and light.  It will not last 2 days.  So make sure you plan to make more before the last piece is eaten:)

So good!  I used chocolate chips instead of nuts for my kids and also replaced the sour cream with non-fat plain Greek yogurt to reduce the fat and it came out great.  Will definitely make this again!

I agree that the baking directions are incorrect. The bread is soupy in the middle at 300 for one hour. Thus, by the time you keep the bread in the oven until cooked, it is dry and overcooked on the outside and on the edges. I wonder if lessening the amount of sour cream, and increasing the amount of flour, might also help?

I've used this recipe ever since I discovered it. However, I can tell you it never comes out the same twice. Over the years I've discovered that it all has to do with the size of your bananas and eggs. When I've used large bananas and only had extra large eggs on hand, this bread doesn't turn out when the recipe is used as posted.  There is too much moisture/fat and the bread doesn't rise nicely. If the batter is very light in color while it's baking I can be guaranteed that the loaves won't turn out and will be heavy like bricks. I've thrown many loaves out. I've tried using extra large eggs with smaller bananas and using 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 cups sour cream and had good luck with that. I'll continue to use this recipe even if I haven't tweaked it to perfection. The flavor is perfect and if you can get the moisture/fat content right it's delicious. My family can't get enough of it.

This was really good. I froze one loaf and on day three I took it out and defrosted it. It was actually better than day 1 because you can taste the flavors. I did not put a topping. It doesn't really need one. I will definitely make this gain. It's a good way to use up sour cream as well.

Followed the directions for 10 servings instead of 32. Yum! I had to cook for 10 minutes longer, other than that no problems. I see why so many people use this recipe.

Made this recipe tonight and it is delicious.

I followed some of the suggestions from other bakers, trying this recipe.  Definitely needed the oven to be set at 325 F and approx 80 minutes did the trick.
Next time, I will definitely decrease the sugar by .5 cup.  The recipe calls for 3.5.  I will use 3 cups...it is almost too sweet, which says a lot, considering I have a crazy sweet tooth.

Love this recipe!! moist and yummy! There is enough for two loaves so I freeze one for later! I especially love (and get a lot of compliments) that the pan is dusted with cinnamon and sugar, what an added bonus!

Best banana bread I've tried. Instead of doing the cinnamon and sugar to dust the pan I sprinkled it on top. It came out awesome. This is now my "go-to" recipe for banana bread!

I had a problem with this recipe. I grew my own bananas and needed a recipe for making a lot of banana bread for freezing. I followed the recipe very closely and therein lies the problem. How much banana? For this recipe it depends completely on which type of banana you use, now doesn't it. I grew Lady Finger bananas which are about 2inches shorter than the length of the normal Chiquita brand found in stores but much sweeter. So the fact that only the number of bananas is given and not a measured amount is problematic in the outcome. The main issue is that one look in the bowl after mixing and I knew I did not have four pans worth. As I stood and scratched, I could see almost two full loaves or three very skinny loves but in no way would there be four loaves to fit the pans. So, in the absence of a measured amount, I added two more bananas mashed. I filled two 7x3 pans allowing for rising. In the end I got just these two loaves. I can't imagine how many bananas it would have taken to make two more whole loaves. The quality of the resulting product was average, nothing to get excited about. But I did use up a portion of the banana bunch, which all come ripe at the same time. So, I'll keep looking and see if I can find a recipe that has a measured amount of bananas and compare this recipe to that one.

I have now made this many many times. I add nutmeg and clove to add a bit more spice in the fall. Every time I make it I get compliments galore! This is absolutely the best banana bread ever.
I do have to cook it for 90 minutes though for it to come out right. At the 45 min mark I have to rotate my loaves just to ensure even baking.

Great recipe Esther my whole family loves it :-). I've been using ur recipe for a couple years now, and my kids beg me to make it, my husband begs me to make it...its a favorite.  I tweak it now and then when I'm feeling creative or don't have one thing or another, but definitely 5 stars for how it's written.  Even when I double the batch, it doesn't last a week in our house.  I freeze the other loaves though, and then when we pull them out and let them defrost they are even more moist. Thanks so much for sharing it with us!

Oh my God! This recipe is awesome especially thanks to SaraLady19! Thanks so much for sharing that crumbly topping recipe. I never would have thought to add the topping to a banana bread. I also added semisweet chocolate chips into the mix. I did not measure, just put some into the mix. My husband loves this bread.

I  USE LESS SUGAR!   I used 1 cup instead of 3 and it was dessert-sweet.  With that change, I got lots of compliments on this banana bread at a party -- three people brought banana bread, and this recipe was the best!  
FYI: Instead of mashing the bananas, I pureed them in a blender.  The moist consistency of the banana bread was perfect.

I absolutely love this recipe! I have made it several times. The sour cream keeps it so moist. The sugar/cinnamon mix on the pan make a nice, light crust. Do not waste your bananas on any other recipe!

Excellent recipe!  This banana bread bakes up moist and delicious without being heavy.  I adapted the recipe by using Splenda instead of sugar, swapping out 1/2 cup of the butter for 1/2 cup applesauce, adding a package and a half of sugar-free vanilla pudding mix, and adding extra cinnamon and vanilla (a tablespoon of each).  It turned out so yummy! This is definitely a recipe I'd make again and again.  Thank you!

I loved this recipe. I did cut it back a bit. I made muffins instead of loaves. I used 2 cups of sugar, 1/2 stick of butter, 1 stick of Parkay, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, 2 cups flour, 1/4 tsp of salt, 2 tsp baking soda, 1 cup light sour cream, 4 bananas, 2 eggs, and I added in a package of Martha White Banana Nut packaged mix. No walnuts or sprinkling of the sugar and cinnamon in the baking pan. I just used baking spray. I almost cooked them a bit too long at 350, so make sure you watch the oven. They are moist and delicious!

Best banana bread recipe I've ever used. I love the candy crunch at the bottom of the bread! I've found that as long as you do that first and it has plenty of time to set, it works out for the best crunch. If you've ever forgotten to prepare the pans first like I have, then it doesn't work as well, but it still tastes good! I highly recommend this recipe!

Love this recipe! I didn't have any sour cream the first time I made it so I made one change, I used plain yogurt in place of the sour cream and replaced half the flour with quick oats. This turned it into a VERY moist but very delicious bread.

Not sure if I should give this recipe 4 or 5 stars. The original version is way too sweet for my taste, and even when I cut the sugar in half, it was still very sweet. Next time, I'll just use 1 cup of sugar, just right for my preference.
I like the generous amount of bananas, I used very ripe ones, and the banana taste was delicious. I used only 4 Tbsp of butter, and 1/2 cup applesauce, whole wheat flour, and low-fat sour cream, and I added a brown sugar crumb topping. It came out wonderful.
I baked the bread as one huge loaf (I don't recommend this unless you have a really big cake tin, because the bread rises quite a bit), and it took 2 hrs and 15 min at 325 degrees to be done just right.
Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Didn't rise properly. The flavor was good, but the consistency was just awful. After an hour at 300, it was still raw. I bumped it up to 400 and baked it another 45 mins and it was edible. But, it was crunchy and overdone on the outside and raw in the middle.

I don't understand what my problem is. This is the third time I have tried this recipe. The flavor is great, but each time I have ended up with raw batter in the middle and the center of the bread caves in. How can you possibly bake this bread at 300 for 1 hr and have it cooked properly. I have thought maybe I was doing something wrong, but I can't imagine what it could be.

I've made this twice and the second batch was just as amazing as the first!  I lost my BN bread recipe three years ago and have been desperately searching for a new one and this is it!  With or without the topping, you just can't go wrong with this recipe! I adjust to time for mini loaves that can be given as gifts. 325 for 45 minutes for 6mini loaves or muffins for about 18 minutes.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I had to change this recipe slightly, so I give it 4 stars.  The way I made it came out spectacular, so I saved a custom private copy to my recipe box.  This recipe yields 2 loaves if you use an 8x4 or larger loaf pan.  I increased the temp to 325 degrees Fahrenheit, and increase the cook time by 15 extra minutes.  I covered the bread with aluminum foil for the last additional 15 minutes to prevent the top from burning.  Also I didn't quite have 16 oz of sour cream so I used 8 oz sour cream and 8 oz vanilla yogurt, roughly.  I eyeballed this ingredient amount.  Great recipe thanks you!

I loved it and followed the recipe pretty much as it was stated.  I also tried some of the suggestions such as adding the brown sugar topping.  I think the sour cream makes a big difference.  I did use low fat sour cream, but it was still relish!  2016 - This time I made it with 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 chick pea flour!!!  I also substituted half the butter with apple sauce - oh and I used about 3/4 amount of sour cream suggested. - Still perfect!

I have made so many banana breads and this one is clearly one of the best. It made three in the regular 5x9 loaf pans. I did half Splenda and half sugar, half whole wheat flour and half all purpose. I added a crumb topping, but it would be just as good without it.

Great!  I only had 8 oz. sour cream and added about 4 oz, vanilla yogurt. Also added about 1/2 cup more flour as batter seemed  too runny. Also used chopped pecans , no walnuts on hand.  Put 1 tsp baking powder as well, and did topping with brown sugar/cinnamon on top. I used baking powder as well as baking soda because I had read on review it didn't rise quite enough.  Rose great! I think it also depends on size & ripeness of bananas.  Mine were large and dark skinned so pretty liquid when mashed!

I should tell you this recipe for me made three loaves of bread. and the recipe doesn't say but you will also need a hand mixer. the dough gets thick. as the recipe calls for a large bowl i think you need a huge bowl for all the batter. my kitchen counters were a mess. this recipe was my first time making any kind of bread. I was so nervous, I usually just bake out of the box recipes. it turned out so good. I was so proud of myself. i will make this again. next time i think i will  sub sour cream for peanut butter and sprinkle chocolate chips on top ! can't wait..

Just made this last night. I made 3 loaves. Wow, this is a great banana bread. I had 6 really ripe bananas, perfect! It came out so moist. Best I've ever had. I did add some nutmeg as someone else stated and some extra cinnamon (just because I love it!). One of the best parts was the cinnamon/sugar used to dust the pan, yummy!! The loaves took longer than 1 hour, probably since I made 3 instead of 4 but no problem, just kept an eye on them. This is my new go to recipe. I'll be making these for Christmas gifts. Thank you so much for sharing this.

Even my fiance, who doesn't like banana, loved these! I made it exactly like the recipe shows, but I divided the batter between a loaf pan and mini muffins. Both were delicious! I left out the nuts. If I were to add raisins next time, I'd use a little less sugar.

I reviewed this recipe back in 2013, when I first baked it.  Here we are in 2016, and this is still the one and only banana bread recipe I use!  I bake this banana bread several times a year, and my friends and coworkers go crazy for it!! :)

I loved this recipe!! I've tried lots of banana bread recipes and this one is my favorite so far. I halved the recipe to make one large loaf. Per some of the reviews I read, I baked mine at about 1 hour 10 minutes at 325. I used 2 medium size eggs and a mix of white sugar and brown sugar and it was perfect.

I love this recipe.  It always wins me rave reviews from my friends and family. The only change I made was the oven temperature.  I took the advice of other reviewers and increased the temperature to 325 degrees.  The bread came out perfectly.

Awesome banana bread. First time to use sour cream on one and was skeptical at first; until the first bite. After that I've been converted. Will definitely keep this recipe under "Faves".

I loved the flavor and moisture of this bread, though I think I made a mistake in halving the recipe and making a larger loaf. It didn't seem to be fully baked in the center, and the whole thing fell apart quite easily. Next time, I'll use smaller bread pans and see what happens. Will definitely try again.

Awesome recipe...made without the nuts...It does make 4 and they don't last very long!!! This is why this recipe works  out great....Gave one away and the other three were gone within 5 days (lunches and snacks)

Mixed all the wet ingredients, butter, sugar and cinnamon in together...blended lightly with my Bamix...then added the flour mix and it was good to go!~ Very smooth mixture.

great recipe- not too sweet, and is specially light. I used a light sour cream as a substitute for regular sour cream with no other changes. The recipe is substantial, to use with a variety of baking dish sizes that made well into a few gifts to friends and neighbors. It was a nice find!

Yummy and it turned out perfectly.  The only reason I gave four stars is because it is heavy on the fat....I have another banana bread recipe that is just as moist and tasty but healthier.  This one I will make on occasion though ; )

Will use sugar crust on future banana breads, but will stick to James Beard banana bread recipe in future, and just use the sour cream on baked potatoes.

I made this banana bread this morning and it was awesome.  I used this recipe as a base because I have to eat gluten free.  The changes I made were 1) 2 cups GF Bisquick + 2 1/2 c rice flour in place of the regular flour (one box of GF  Bisquick only holds 2 cups..Who knew?) 2) I only had 5 extremely ripe bananas, so I stirred in 2 single serving cups of cinnamon applesauce (about 1 cup). 3)  The GF Bisquick already has the salt and baking powder in it but the rice flour did not so I added 1/2 the baking powder and salt called for in the recipe 4) One of the reviewers said to blend the flour into the wet ingredients by hand because doing it with a mixer makes it more cake like so OF COURSE I used the hand mixer to blend all the ingredients.  Any little bit helps when cooking GF!  5) I  skipped the cinnamon sugar dusting and just greased my pans really well.  6) I stirred in an ENTIRE bag of chocolate chips (remember, this makes four loaves!).  7) I only had one regular loaf pan and 3 smaller ones, so the regular loaf pan wasn't quite full, but the others were.  I adjusted the temperature per another reviewer to 325 and set the timer for an hour.  I had all four loaves in the oven at once.  2 of the smaller ones were done at about 50 minutes and the 1 semi full larger one and other smaller one took an additional 5 minutes.  Hands down the BEST GF Banana Bread EVER.  My family (who does NOT have to eat GF) devoured two loaves! I had planned on freezing three of them....lol.

I reduced sugar by half the second time I tried this recipe, and then it met my German taste perfectly! Guess we just don't eat as sweet in Germany in general. Whole family loves it now! Thanks for the recipe.

This is the first banana bread that I have ever made that did not come out to dry.  I cut the recipe in half and it resulted in 1 very big loaf.  I think next time I will put a bit more sugar and cinnamon in the bottom of the pan.

I keep trying new recipes, only to return to this one.  It is so good.  I do end up baking it a little longer than suggested and I cut it in half, because 4 loaves is way too much.

The only thing I did differently is that I added nutmeg and substituted 1 cup of sugar with brown sugar.  I didn't add nuts either.  This was a really nice banana bread recipe.  I cooked at 300 degree for an hour and they came out wonderfully!!  Everyone loved them.  Will definitely make again. :)

I'm a novice baker, and this recipe made me feel like a pro! Everyone loved this... It made so much... I made two loaves and 2 dozen muffins with the batter. The only thing I changed was adding a little nutmeg, and upped the cooking temp to 325. Amazing!!

I don't usually like to make banana bread--always turns out underdone and mushy for me, despite cooking much longer than recommended.  This recipe turned out great.  I halved the recipe and made two loaves (using 2 eggs).  A prior post recommended 325 deg for 75 minutes.  My oven cooks a bit hot, so I checked at 55 minutes--the toothpick was clean and they were done!  After cooling, both loaves easily came out of the pan--no chunks of left-behind mushy bread.  I had added the brown sugar crumble topping, and the taste is quite good.  This will be a go-to banana bread recipe.

This is it!!! I've made this twice and I feel like a rockstar! Its easy if you have the items prepared. This time I used what I had on hand so I substituted eggs for Egg whites and used less flour and added Ground Flaxseed and it still came out great! I made it as a Superbowl treat for the guys and they devoured it!

I cut this recipe in 1/3 since I had 2 bananas. I also reduced the amount of sugar (1/2 cup for the reduced recipe) and the butter (3 Tbs). I added some cinnamon/sugar/butter crumble topping that I had left over from another recipe. Delicious and very moist. I cooked the single loaf for 1 hour at 325 deg.

This recipe was so good and so filling. I usually try to follow the exact recipe but I didn't have eggs so I used 1/2 c. oil. I probably could have used 1/4 c instead.I halved the recipe and it made 24 muffins. My 3 girls ages 8,4 and 18 months loved them.

I halved the recipe and the only thing I changed were the eggs.  I used two instead of 1 1/2. I made one loaf with walnuts and one without.  Both loaves came were delicious.  I will definitely make again.

I just took the loafs out and let it cool for a bit before cut a piece off and was floored how good it was! The best banana bread I have made to date. I did use two loaf pans (had extra batter that I might make cupcakes out of) and followed other's advice and bumped the temp to 325. It took about an hour and a half to bake but it seemed to have come out great! Highly recommended recipe!

I wasn't paying attention when I first made this, and didn't realize it would make FOUR loaves, but it freezes beautifully. It's our favorite banana bread.

Excellent recipe.  Lots of banana flavor and very moist!  I used half sour cream, half Greek yogurt (just because I ran out of sour cream) and it worked great.  Add a little brown sugar on the top for a nice sweet crunch.

I had two problems with this recipe:  Took an hour and a half to cook and the batter oozed over the sides of my LARGE loaf pans.  Next time I'll put a few cups of batter into muffin tins to avoid the mess.  This loaf is not as sweet as most BNB recipes and that I find to be a major plus!

this is excellent as is but I got creative and made 2 batches one with shredded coconut and walnuts and the other one with white chocolate chips with chopped pecans :) house smells sooooo good too! Dusting the pan with the cinnamon and sugar really made it good too :)

Absolutely perfect just the way it is. I'm sick of people saying they love the recipe but added about 10 different things to it to change it. This bread needs no changes to it AT ALL!

I tried the recipe...and I am soooo in love with this one! 
It certainly is a keeper. Like some I too had a concern about the creaming of the sugar and the butter and the Temp and Time. I just thought it was me being anxious to get these bananas going. As I have waisted afew bananas in my time. Of course with the best of intentions to making bread. And not having the butter at room temp. is my fault. Getting back to the results of my Bread...Wonderful. Longer than 1 hour baking time. I used a larger set of pans {8 by 4's?} The recipe made two loaves then with the bit left over I made 3 small sized loaves for my daughter and added semi sweet mini chips. She loved it. In fact, I baked them in my toaster over at 300 as not to interupt my reg oven. Just awesome. And in closing, I guess they would of been over the top if they had the nuts in there but my Husband likes them without so thats the way I baked THIS batch. LOL I may do a NUT overload next batch. Thanks for the recipe and look forward to making Holiday cookies next!

We LOVED this recipe. I had 8 bananas, so I used them all. I cut back the sugar by 1/3, and then used light brown sugar for 1/3 of the remaining sugar. (1 1/3c white, 2/3c brown). Also, with the additional bananas, I felt like the batter was a bit wet, so I added nearly 1 cup more flour. I baked it at 350, rather than 300. It was excellent! The sugar and cinnamon in the pan really added a nice extra crust to the outside. A great recipe for sharing!

I made this recipe last week for a group of friends that joined us here on Isla Mujeres from NJ to help with our christian ministry.  They loved it without a doubt. Some ask me to make some more so that they can take it back home with them when they go. A few days later I made some more and added dried cranberries which made it even better. A+ recipe.

This banana bread has become famous in our community.  Everyone loves it.  It is so moist and wonderful tasting.  I put a little raw sugar on the top for a sweet, crunching crust.  I'm right now hoping my bananas get ripe enough to make it for a big party we are having in a few days.

Moist & stands up to the palate of foodie friends. You can make it undetectably NON-DAIRY by subbing-in a small container of GREEK YOGURT (5.3 oz) in place of sour cream; and FLAX MEAL for 1 egg (1 TBL meal to 3 TBL water = 1 egg); and MARGARINE for butter.  Still yum!

The taste of this banana bread is phenomenal.. this is the best one i have found on this site.  The only thing I didn't like is that the bread didn't rise.  It wasn't the fault of any of the ingredients, I just don't think it's meant to.  I filled the pans about 2/3 full. The texture is perfect.  This time I halved all the ingredients (except I used 2 eggs), and used 2 regular sized bread loaves. Next time I may increase the ingredients and fill the pans almost to the top, since they don't rise.  I wouldn't skip the dusting of cinnamon sugar.. I loved this part! Thanks for the great recipe!

After years of making and LOVING the other infamous banana bread recipe on this site, I decided to give this one a shot (and it didn't hurt that I had a spare 16 oz of sour cream that I had to use up!).  Sorry, but this recipe doesn't even come close to the Banana Banana Bread recipe I've been following for holiday gifts, as a snack with hot tea, or whenever the spirit moved me.  I really wanted to like this one, but I'm afraid I just don't.  It was more of a hassle and the flavors weren't nearly as satisfying as I'd expected.

DEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELICIOUS!!!  This is how I'm making my banana bread from this point forward.  I love the cinnamon and sugar dusting of the pan.  Adds some wonderful spice.  And I think it's even better the day after making it.  Next time I'll add the nuts...... had none in the house this time.

I made this pretty much exactly as written except I didn't have the same size pans. I used 3-8x4 pans and baked them at 350 for 55 minutes in a convection oven. My only criticism is that I'm not so much a fan of cinnamon and banana together. It's not bad, but the next time I make this I think I'll leave the cinnamon out. I love the two separately but not together. Otherwise it has great texture and flavor, and will definitely make it again.

This recipe was great! The only thing I change was I baked them in 3 8*5 pans & added about 15 minutes to the bake time!  Next time I will probably alternate the flour and sour cream additions, just so that Im not adding all the flour at once!  This bread came outta the pan beautifully!!  Thanks so much!

Good banana bread recipe. Followed exactly other than adding a teaspoon of banana extract.  To make bigger loaves I split the batter between just three loaf pans.  Thank you for sharing

This is the best banana bread I have ever had. I added 1 C choc chips along w/nuts just b/c I'm normally not a huge banana bread fan, and it was great (dust chips and nuts with flour to help keep from possible sinking). The cinnamon coating in the pans was a huge hit in that it made for such a nice and tasty crust.

Makes 24 muffins. Added 1 cup chocolate chips and used creme fraiche instead of sour cream - WONDERFUL!  My kids loved them...so did I:-)  Baked @ 300F for approx 28 mins.

Followed the recipe and it turned out great.  Took longer to cook than it recommended.  The children scarfed it down.

For sure the best banana bread recipe EVER!  I have substituted plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream with excellent results.  Also, I use three (3) 9x7 inch loaf pans and bake @325 for approx. 1 hour, or until the "toothpick test" indicates doneness.  Next time I will try adding chocolate chips since so many people are raving about that.  Can't wait for those bananas to ripen up!

I am a baker I love to make tasty treats and love to bake for the holidays. This is absolutely the best Banana Bread recipe that I have ever eaten. The sour cream is the trick it makes the bread moist and adds a bit of a twist to the taste. I am putting this recipe on my favorites list and will for sure be making this for my holiday gift baskets. ENjoy!

I've made this bread 100 times, and it has never failed me.  I do, however, agree with the baking time and oven temp.  If you use a loaf pan that is not deep, the time and temp should be ok.  I, however, used a pan with four loaf compartments.  Since this is a very dense bread, I cooked for 1hr/45min on 300, then covered the loaves with tin foil and turned up the temp to 350 for 15.  This seemed to do the trick.  I used half the sugar and 1/2 whole wheat flour.  Also a small container of applesauce to sub for some of the butter.  DELISH!  LB fromGlenRock

This recipe was absolutely delicious!!  I had left over bananas that were going bad if i didnt use them so i found this recipe.  I only had about 8 oz of sour cream so i substituted the remaining 8 oz with approx 8 oz of sweetened condensed milk and it was outstanding.  I only had 2 loaf pans so I added about a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips to the rest of the batter and placed in muffin cups.  I put cream cheese frosting on the muffins and took them to my husbands work and they all cant stop asking for more.... I will be making this again and again!!!

Everyone loves this recipe.  Makes delicious, moist banana bread great for bake sales, thanking neighbors or just a yummy treat for yourself.  My kids would eat a whole loaf in a day.  We make a 1/2 batch with 2 eggs which makes one small loaf for us and six mini-loaves to give away.  Best banana recipe I've found so far.

This recipe turned out some very good banana bread, but I did like the "Best Ever Banana Bread" slightly better.  However, I don't often have the buttermilk that the other bread calls for on hand and this bread is also excellent.

Wonderful banana bread recipe. Actually tastes like banana bread, unlike some recipes that have banana flavor. I halved the recipe and baked in a bread pan for 1 hour 15 minutes. Turned out great.

Wow, this bread was amazing! I thought it was quite odd adding the sour cream but boy was I wrong, it turned out great. I had 8 x 4 loaf pans so I managed to fill up three. The instructions do not inlcude how much to fill the pans so for a first time baker this can be confusing. I filled them up about 3/4 of the way and they turned out perfect, however if you try to bake them all at the same time plan on adding about 15-20 minutes more. I actually baked them all together for an hour and they were not done so I stuck them in one at a time for 5 minutes more and then did the trick. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I've probably made this 10 times now in just the past year. It's wonderful for breakfast freezer meals! I made half a batch the first time and really regretted it. Our family of 4 eaters ate all four loves probably in two weeks. I recommend making it all and slicing it then freezing whatever you can before it's gone! Going to make a batch now with my 3 and 2 year old girls while the 5 month old takes nap!

Love this recipe! It doesn't even need the walnuts which I am such a big fan! Soooo moist!  I cut the serving size to "12" and made one big loaf of bread. It came out perfect for a family of three!

I used my mixer for mashing all of the bananas. Added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the flour mixture. Rather than nuts, I used raisins. Baked at 325. I'd make it again.

I made this exactly how the recipe said...AMAZING!!!!  My family gobbled it down.  I made a half batch for the first try and made one regular and the other loaf I added chocolate chips.  My husband said this was better than his moms!  (this is the ultimate compliment!)

This is the best banana bread I have ever baked OR tasted. It's actually better than store bought or bakery banana bread! It is SO incredibly moist and fluffy. I could eat another pan! Everyone always asks me to make it for potlucks.

I make this recipe every time I have overripe bananas and everyone in my house LOVES it!!! I follow the recipe exactly except I omit the walnuts (just don't care for nutty bread) and bake it at a lower temp for longer in two loaf pans instead of four. Highly recommend this recipe.

The perfect banana bread right here. Look no further. I reduce the servings to 16 in order to make 2 loaves. The only thing I add is some brown sugar crumb topping (2 T flour, 1/3 C packed brown sugar, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and 1 T butter cut in). Absolutely delicious. Thank you so much for sharing!

I used slighly less sugar and instead of all white sugar used mostly white sugar some some brown - delicious! Although I would maybe cut the sugar even more next time.

This is a very moist bread. I did cut back on the sugar and used half brown sugar so it wouldn't be too sweet. I will make this again.

This was a fantastic recipe.  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers - cutting the recipe in half and used 6 oz greek yogurt, 3/4 cup of sugar, 1 cup of whole wheat flour (1 1/4 all purpose flour), 2 tsp of cinnamon and 4 well ripe bananas.  I baked in at 325 degrees for one hour.  Thank you to Esther and a few others for the great tips.

I made this, substituting a cup of molasses and a cup of brown sugar for two of the cups of white sugar, which made for a darker batter.  I used light sour cream without any ill effects.  I made this in a bundt cake pan, and I added chopped walnuts to the batter.  I substituted sweet sorghum flour and rice flour and a half-teaspoon of Xanthan gum for the wheat flour to make it gluten free.  It still rose and made for a great bread/cake.  I mixed everything in an electric stand mixer.    Cooking time takes longer than an hour.  Check it in the middle with a toothpick, and keep cooking 15 minutes extra, recheck with toothpick, and repeat until the toothpick comes out clean.  Mine took an hour and 40 minutes.

Best recipe ever since it stood up to all my changes.  I used applesauce instead of butter and two cups Splenda and one cup sugar.  I also used whole wheat flour and egg substitute.  And I used pecans instead of walnuts.  It took a VERY long time to cook at 325 but it was the best banana bread I have ever made...and I have tried ALOT! Thanks for the recipe!!

Best banana bread recipe EVER!!!! I will never use another recipe for banana bread.... this is THE ONE! I halved the recipe, used two 8x5 loaf pans and baked for 40 minutes. I probably could have cooked a couple minutes less. So moist and flavorful. The slight crunch from the cinnamon sugar coated pans is a nice touch. EXCELLENT!!!!

Wonderful recipe. I baked my bread in the large loaf pans. I got two loafs out of the recipe which was perfect because we ate the first loaf in a matter of minutes. I did have to keep my bread in the oven longer but I was cooking two loaves for the original recipes one. My son (8) told me that my banana bread is now better than grandmas!!

This recipe has become a family favorite.... Have made it many, many times since I first found this recipe....made sure I have more than one copy...in case I lose one...   It is the only banana quick bread I make now...like it too cause it is a large recipe...can make mini loaves and give to all my friends as well as family... Sometimes I vary it a little and add some mini choc chips... not that it needs it... it is delicious without them.

Absolutely delicious.  The sour cream adds a little something to keep it from the average boring banana bread.  Got lots of compliments on it!   I actually had made it several times now, including one time with Splenda once instead of the sugar, since my brother is diabetic, and he loved it!

This was the best banana bread I've ever had.  I did use 1 cup of almond flour in place of 1 cup of the all purpose flour just to make it a little healthier.  This made the bread a bit more dense and flavorful.  The texture and taste is sticky but not overly sweet.  I will make this again.

my husband used to be the banana bread person in our house.....that is until i made THIS banana bread!!!!!  it is totally awesome!!!!!! the slight sweetness of the cinnamon/sugar mixture sprinkled on the baking pans is perfect.   the taste of cinnamon and banana are totally blended together and neither are overpowering.  the addition of 16 oz. of sour cream only moistens this beauty perfectly.  the only thing i will do differently, on occassion, just as a little change,  is add 1 - 1-1/2 cups of raisins next time.  DEFINITELY A KEEPER IN THIS HOUSE!!!!  freezes well too!!!!!  thanks so much for sharing this one!!!!!

I halved the recipe because I only had 3 bananas.  I split every thing in half but used 2 eggs.  I also didn't want to wait an hour, so I made them as muffins and mini-loaves.  Cooked about 25 min. on 350.  They are really good, but not "wow" good.  Maybe I'll try mixing in another fruit, such as blueberries, next time!

This is my absolute favorite to make when I have ripe bananas that need used.  I love the fact that there is no oil/butter in this recipe, and I always use reduced fat sour cream, and 1/2 whole wheat, 1/2 white flour.  I prefer the ease of this bread even over the Banana Crumb Muffins on this site.  Enjoy!

This is my favorite banana bread recipe! Made it several times and everyone gives me bananas because they always want their own loaf.

Yummmm.... I did make a few changes. First I hal- ved the recipe. I added a pinch of ground clove and nutmeg to the batter w/ 1/3 brown sugar, 1 1/2 cups of white sugar. I also used the crumb topping from the recipe banana crumb muffins. Sooo good!

This banana bread stayed moist and held together well. I made a third of the recipe (using balkan-style plain yogurt) and baked it in one 9x4" loaf pan. It was a little bit too sweet, and didn't rise as much as I would have liked; however, I will make it again with a few modifications.

I made this and substitued 2 cups of splenda and 1 cup brown sugar. I also added a little fresh nutmeg. I didn't have enough loaf pans so I used glass 13x9x2 dish and cut across into 3 sections. It turned out delicious and moist.  Will defintely use again!

Just tried a slice warm out of the oven, and it's DELICIOUS. I cut the sugar by a 1/2 cup, and it's still more than sweet enough. Excellent recipe I will be using again for the holidays.

I have made this recipe over and over again.  It never fails me!  It's become expected that I bring it to my department's potlucks and nobody else dares to attempt banana bread!  My family looks forward to the holidays when I show up with little loafs for each of them.  It is, by far, the best banana bread recipe I have ever tasted.  I can't understand some of the reviewers that had issues with it as I have baked it so many times, in so many different pan types.  The only person that didn't like it, doesn't like bananas!  If you know ANYTHING at all about baking, adjusting the temp and times for varied pan sizes is quite simple.  And I'm a novice baker.  In conclusion, if the recipe fails, it's YOU not the recipe!!

I just finished making this (I made it into a 3 story cake instead of loaves) and it is great! And really very easy! I´ll definitely do this recipe again. Though next time I´ll use less sugar (I highly recommend this...it was a little bit too sweet for my taste) and make less servings. I used 2 1/2 white flour and 2 wheat flour; also, I combined white and brown sugar, added some nutmeg, and used more than the 2 teaspoons of cinnamon. Everything turned out great :)

Outstanding! I increased the oven temperature to 325. Made 1/2 recipe using two 8x4 pans. I recommend lining the bottom of the pan with parchment paper - makes it easy to get the bread out of the pan.

This bread is great ! I did just as the recipe said. No problems everyone who ate loved it. If it aint broke don't fix it. My husband especially loved the cinnamon & sugar coating. I might of added a little more than the recipe called for otherwise kept it as was.

I made this with a few alterations. Used 1 cup butter instead of 3/4 cup and 16 oz. of plain whole milk yogurt instead of 16 oz sour cream. I also added a few dashes of ground cloves. I am going to be passing this on to the Mother-In-Law to test out.

These smell so good when they're baking and they taste great. I bake double batches, then wrap all the extras in a couple of layers of plastic wrap. Two loaves fit in a freezer bag and you can take one out and defrost it in minutes in your microwave!

This recipe was wonderful! It made 4 small loaf pans and 6 muffins. I had to bake it an extra 10-15 min. I took it to work and everyone LOVED it. Was super moist and flavorful.

This is the best Banana Bread I have ever had.  I cut the recipe in half and bake everything in one pan for an extra hour.  It comes out yummy and moist.

Excellent!  I only have the standard Pyrex loaf dishes (which are slightly larger than the loaf sizes called for in the recipe), so I raised the temperature to 325, baked for about 75 minutes. They came out great, and there was just enough batter left over to make 12 muffins.

First time i had to sub 1C of brown sugar for white b/c i didn't realize i was almost out of white and it was 11pm... and i couldn't really leave the kids in bed to run off to the store... turns out its still delish!!  So much that I made a 5 loaf batch today (I only eat a loaf or two, I'm using the " because I'm pregnant" excuse!!! I give the rest away) and have found that 5 loaves is the max amount of batter that my kitchenaid stander can hold!!! Awesome awesome!!

This turned out PERFECT!! SO yummy! The only thing I did differently is bake at 350 degrees for one hour and added choco chips.

The best banana bread I've ever made!!! I did two small things differently:  1 - Sprinkled more cinnamon and sugar on top of the uncooked loaves. 2 - After cooking at 300 for an hour, I turned up the oven to 325 for another 10 minutes since, as #3 states, "Back for 1 hour, until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean," and mine did not.  With the additional time at a higher temp, they were perfect!

This was a very moist flavorful banana bread.  I used reduced fat sour cream and I cut the sugar down to 2 cups instead of 3. It was still very sweet. I did have to bake it a little longer than 1 hour.

This recipe is so forgiving!  I have made it many times, the only change being I bake it at 350, not at the 300 as stated.  I made it today but had to substitute 0 fat strawberry yogurt for the sour cream and its still awesome.  I think my family deliberately let the banana's spoil so this page comes up.

This is by far the best banana bread I have ever made! I have made this recipe at least 10 times. The only I do differant is add cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter instead of dusting it. I use 2 large pans and 1 small pan. Also, I bake it at 400' for 45 mins. Comes out perfect!

When it comes to Banana Bread there are high standards around my house.  These recipe moves to the top of my list.  The cinnamon/sugar dust had mixed feelings (I made it with and without).  I use Real Mexican Vanilla extract it makes a big difference in the flavor of everything.  Quick reciepe but it is slow to cook but well worth the wait.

I also tried it with the applesauce, subtracting some of the butter.  I also baked it at 325 degrees for 1 hr & 10 min.  The texture was still a bit doughy though.  I decided to slice the bread (cold) into about 1 1/2 inch slices and toast them under the broiler for about five minutes.  Yummy!  At first I thought I'd waisted my time and ingredients.  But now I know I will be making this again!  Well, gotta go before the kids and the hubbie eat the rest!!

If I could give this recipe 100 stars I would. I followed it to the T...with the exception of adding the crumble topping as the previous person had recommended. I ended up having to add more flour because the topping came out mushy...but with the extra flour it was PERFECT.. Love love LOVE this recipe!

I and everyone I fed loves the bread. Comes out moist but not so as to being sticky.  Love the way the sour cream tames the sweetness as stated.

I loved it! Turned out really well.  I did put tin foil over it when it was getting close to done to keep the top from getting too brown.  I also took someone's advice and sprinkled cinnamon/sugar on top before throwing them in the oven.  Other than that, stuck to the recipe and it turned out GREAT!  Everyone loves it. ^_^

OMG Soooo good.  I didn't have quite enough white sugar on hand so I used a cup of brown sugar and 2 cups of white.  Still turned out awesome.  I followed someone else's advice and added a crumble to the top (zucchini bread recipe).  Will make this again for sure!

Nice recipe. I only had 3 bananas so I halved the recipe and it turned out fine. I wish I would have had one more banana for a little more flavor. My husband loved the crust - I also sprinkled sugar on top of the batter before baking and it made a terrific top crust. The bread was very dense and moist. I probably could have cooked it 10 minutes longer - but it was a hit. I also baked it in one large bread pan at 325. Thanks, I've found my new banana bread recipe.

Yum! Followed other reviews & baked at 325. Perfect. Great texture. I'm eager to try freezing and see how it holds up. My kids really enjoyed this, but I might want a little bit stronger spice. Some nutmeg or extra cinnamon maybe?  My only word of caution is to consider halving the recipe. I didn't look ahead to see that this makes FOUR loaves. My KitchenAid was filled to the brim with batter and I had to stir in the last of the flour and nuts by hand in a larger bowl.

WOW! This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever tried! Everyone that tried it wanted a copy of the recipe. The sour cream and putting cinnamon/sugar in the pan prior to baking were wonderful improvements! I wouldn't change a thing.

Delicious! In an attempt to make it a bit more healthy, I used 2 1/2 cups white flour, 2 cups whole wheat flour. I reduced the sugar to 2 cups. I also used low fat sour cream. To counterbalance all this hard work, I then added mini chocolate chips rather than walnuts. Result: Heaven! My fiance would have eaten the whole loaf if I hadn't have stopped him!  *Side note: I made 2 loaves and 12 muffins out of this recipe. I took someone else's recommendation and baked the loaves at 325 for 1 hour 10 minutes, the muffins took 45 minutes. Turned out perfect!

I made 1 batch using the recipe given (scaling the measurements accordingly) and was disappointed in how it turned out.  I would suggest using half of the measurements if you want just 1 loaf.  Otherwise you get a shallow bread which does not look appetizing.

Ok, this is the best banana bread recipe I have tried.  I even overcooked one loaf on accident and it was still good!!  The sour cream definitely makes a difference.  A tip - don't put too much cinnamon/sugar when dusting.  I made loafs and muffins and sprinkled a little c/s mixture on the bottom of the muffin pan and then on top of the muffins.....PERFECT!  They were soooo good!

Great recipe! I halved recipe, doing what others did-2 eggs, 4 bananas. It only yielded one loaf though. I cooked at 300 degrees but I think 325 would have been better as I had to cook it about 20 min longer. Maybe it's just my oven. The very bottom of the bread tasted funky and I think it was from putting the cinnamon and sugar down first. Other than that, one of the best banana breads I've had and made!

Good recipe.  I got three loaves out of this but filled the pan too full and had a hard time getting them done.  Loved the flavor and will make again.

Absolutely loved this recipe!  Made this recipe one night and brought one of the loaves in to work the next day... The whole loaf was gone in an hour!  A couple of changes were made, though.  I added in some cloves and a little allspice for a spicier taste.  Also used reduced fat sour cream instead of the regular.  Before baking, I dusted the loaf pans with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar.  This is the best banana bread recipe I have found! :)

This recipe sounded amazing and with such a high rating, I thought I couldn't go wrong.  too much sugar, too much flour, and the cooking temp is so not right!  When I took this out of the oven, it was completely raw in the center and done on the edges.  I bumped it up to 375 and cooked for another 20 minutes.  I ended up with 4 loaves of bread with moist, perfect centers and overcooked edges.  The taste is okay, but not how I like my banana bread.  Will not use again, but if you use this recipe, cook at 350 for maybe 1hr 15 min and cut back on the sugar!

This is the best banana bread I have ever had and it's super easy to make. I did end up cutting the recipe in half because there was no way we needed 4 loaves. Needless to say, this is now my staple banana bread recipe. YUM!

This really is the best banana bread recipe there is...ever.  It makes the whole house smell so good.  The only thing I did different is cut the sugar to about 1/2.  If the bananas are really ripe, then they add the rest of the sweetness the recipe needs.

I cut the recipe in half and it was truly amazing.  My very picky girls both loved it.  The only change I made was to not use any cinnamon and i dusted the loaf pans with brown sugar.  Oh my - it's simply delicious

Really really good, but holy cow - 3 cups is a lot of sugar!  We all enjoyed it but consider it more of a desert than a breakfast food since it has so much sugar in it!

This is PHENOMENAL!! All our family and friends love it! And I make it for them every two weeks or so (it's that good!) I've tried a bunch of different banana bread recipes and this one is by far the best. I don't change anything about the actual bread, but I do use Saralady19's topping of butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and flour, and I make home made whipped cream on the side for each person to top their piece with - 2 cups whipping cream, 1/2 cup sugar, 2 teaspoons vanilla.  Thanks for this amazing recipe! :)

I halved the recipe and baked it in a large loaf pan.  It baked a little longer than the recipe called for (maybe 15 minutes?) and came out perfectly.

I watched the video and made the loaves, using some apple sauce instead of all the sugar.  I also added blueberries and cranberries.  Today I will be adding raspberries and blueberries.  Gently folding it all together, the loaves did rise.  Warm with some butter is absolutely delicious.  Many compliments.

I was a little disappointed in this bread.I've been trying lots of different banana bread recipes trying to find the perfect one.I was hoping this would be the one because of all the high reviews.I did not have quite enough sour cream so I had to use some greek yogurt but other than that I followed the recipe.I just didn't care for the texture.I think it had too much flour for my taste.I've also noticed that out of all the banana bread reipes I've tried I prefer the ones made with oil instead of butter.I'm going to keep searching for the perfect banana bread recipe.

I made this yesterday and halved the recipe which made one nice large loaf.  It is delicious and not too sweet or too bananay if that's a word.  I like the addition of cinnamon but I think I will reduce the amount next time because I think it over powered the taste of banana.  A great recipe all in all and so easy.  Thanks.

This Banana bread is fantastic. My husband doesn't care for banana bread but went crazy over this recipe! I halved the recipe & made 2 loaves. I used 3.5 large bananas & just sort of squished them in my hands for a few seconds so I didn't completely mash them up. But the chunks in the bread made it even better! I didn't feel like using 1 1/2 eggs so I just used 2 eggs. I used light sour cream & also used half splenda and half white sugar. I left the 2 loaves in at 300 degrees for 1 hour, rotating the loaves in the oven half way. I also lightly covered the loaf pans with foil after 40 minutes. Wonderful, wonderful, Wonderful!

I cut the recipe in half because I didn't want 4 loaves. It had a nice flavor and good presentation.  It is a little denser probably because of the sour cream.

The BEST banana bread I've ever made.  I'm always looking for one that is super moist and flavorful - this is finally it!  Like another, I halved it, used 2 eggs & 4 bananas and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips to half of it.  This will be my only banana bread recipes finally!  Next time I'll add raspberries or blueberreis too!

This is the best banana bread recipe I've ever made.I used a mini loaf pan, which made 16 loaves. This size is great for lunches or snacking.I did add Brown sugar to the coating around the pan, which turned out amazing and gave the bread a sort of crunchie caramel taste.This recipe is a must for any banana bread lover.

Moist, but WAY TO SWEET.  Too much sugar, it's over powering the flavour of the banana.  I also didn't see a need for dusting the pans with the sugar and cinnamon mixture. I also substituted non sweetened apple sauce for the butter.

This is, without a doubt, the BEST banana bread!!! Halved the recipe and followed the instructions to a tee and the results were superb!  Like many others who did the same, I too wish that I had not cut the recipe and just made the 4 loaves.  The two that I did make were gone in less than two days!  Plan on making it again very, very soon. THANKS FOR A GREAT RECIPE!

Oh yeah. The best banana bread I've ever tasted.  I just replaced both my Mom's and Grandma's banana bread recipe with this one.

This is an awesome recipe. The comment about increasing the temp to 350 and adding nutmeg and cloves is perfect. Also, don't overbeat  the ingredients.  I've made it several times and loved it.  But last time I used my fancy 400$ stand mixer (I overbeat it!) and it was much more bland. Normally I love it.

I make banana bread a lot, but since I had sour cream I thought I'd try this. I didn't care for the texture and actually found the flavor a bit flat.

Pretty good. I used whole wheat flour. Indiscernible. I liked it most when it was still warm, but still yummy.

OMG!!  This was fantastic.  I have some sad looking bananas that either needed pitched or cooked.  Was going to make a banana cake but I knew I would be the only one eating it.  So, I thought why not banana bread.  My house smells wonderful and my husband and I (plus kids) have almost finished a whole loaf. Thank goodness there are 3 more.   Thank you for sharing.   I was able to cook it at 300 for 1 hr about 15-20 minutes for 2 loaves at a time.

I made this bread twice so far and everyone keeps asking me for the recipe.  It's just fabulous as it is.  Thanks.  I did sprinkled a little extra sugar, cinnamon and nuts on the top just before baking though.  Gave it a little extra mmmmmm.

This is the most AWESOME banana bread, I didn't even have the walnuts so made it without and usually not crazy about bread with no nuts but this was the best I ever had! I ate 3/4 of a loaf in one evening and I am not a big eater but this ended up being my supper because I was addicted to it LOL and just couldn't stop eating it especially right out of the oven and you cannot taste the sour cream at all, it is just there to make the loaves moist and they are! You should really try this one!

This is the best Banana Bread I have ever made.  I hate to say it but its even better than my Grandmothers.  I with she were alive to I could bake a loaf for her.  My nephew just loves when I make him a loaf all for himself.   I make four at a time and they don't last long...it's a waste to try and freeze it.

Wonderful recipe! Every time I used to make banana bread my husband use to say that his mother made great banana bread, maybe I should call her for the recipe. After I served this for him, he stopped saying that. That's proof enough for me! I've also made these with chocolate chips sprinkled on the top, and I've frozen them with great results.

Best banana bread I've ever made!  Loved the texture. Used 2 c. white sugar & 1 c. light brown sugar.  Substituted mini chocolate chips for nuts due to allergies.  I only had regular-sized loaf pans, so I adjusted oven temp to 325° and watched closely toward end of cooking time.  Perfectly browned but not quite done at 1 hr; covered lightly with foil and baked an additional 7 minutes.  Made 3 regular loaves & 6 muffins.

Best I've ever made! I would cut the 2tsp. cinnamon to 1 tsp. next time. The sugar cinnamon coating also adds the additional cinnamon so 1tsp. in the batter is plenty.

WOW.  This is very good.  I had no problems with the recipe at all.  It makes a lot of banana bread so I halved the recipe.  It's way too yummy and I got rave reviews from the folks at work!  Thanks Esther.

This is the most moist, amazing banana bread I have ever tasted.  I have never changed anything in this recipe except for the servings.  Sometimes I have 2 bananas and sometimes I have 5 or 6.  I just adjust the servings to make what I need and it always tastes fabulous!!  My family and my neighbors all love this recipe.  Thanks, Ms. Nelson

This is one of the BEST loaf/breads I have in my arsenal now.  LIke many, I made changes to suit our lifestyle & taste.  We eat a certain way and one serving of this bread & a glass of milk or piece of fruit make a meal of us (we eat 4/5 meals, approx 4oo c. each throughout the day.   I have calculated each serving to be approx 305cal.    3 loaves @ 10 serves each.  2 tbsp butter + 1/4 c applesauce  1 1/2 C. Br sugar Splenda  Bananaa remain the same - 6  16 oz container Fat Free sour cream  vanilla, cinnamon, salt, soda - same  4 1/3 c. Nutriblend flour (in Canada - like W.W. pastry flour)  2 C. chopped walnuts  2 C. semisweet Choc Chips   (@ 30 servings, the nuts & choc. works out to 2 tbps. per serving, which is exactly what I intended)    I put a little cinnamon/sugar mixture on the bottom/ sides of the pans (after coating them with Pam Baking (flour) spray, but I don't find it necessary.  This bread is FABULOUS and stands on it's own as a cut above others.  Freezes   incredibly well and is really moist.      Be prepared to let cool (try some :) - cut in to servings and individually wrap w/ seran, freeze and have to eat when you want ...   All the best ...

I halved this recipe and it made 4 mini loaves of bread.  I cannot say that this recipe is bad or I disliked it, but I didn't like the cinnamon in it and I thought it had way too much sugar.  I did like the addition of sour cream as it does make it very moist.  It also seemed like it took a long time to bake as most breads are baked at 350.  I will go back to my tried and true banana recipe bread (not on this site) and experiment with the addition of sour cream to moisten it up.

This is by far the best banana bread I've ever made...I used 2 Pampered Chef loaf pans kept the heat at 350F.  PERFECT!  Make sure your oven is pre-heated

i thought this recipe was nearly impossible to get baked. It took almost 2 hours to bake and I had to turn the temp. up to 350. I liked the banana banana bread much better sorry I will not be using this recipe again.

Amazing recipe! Very delicious and moist. I did not have sour cream so I used plain yogurt instead. It was still very good. I loved the idea of coating the pan with cinnamon/sugar, it made the outside of the bread sweet and delicious! I halved the recipe and still had enough batter to fill  a large bread pan and a small bread pan.  I will definitely make this again.

The only reason I'm even giving this recipe 4 stars is because of taste. I baked 1 loaf for 1 hr at 350 and it ended up completely raw in the center... yuck. I decided to bake the rest of the batter in mini muffin pans and baked them for 15-20 minutes at 350 and were perfect.

This bread tasted really good and stayed moist/fresh for days with the help of my pyrex loaf dish and lid. I only made one loaf and i had more bananas that the recipe called for and I wanted to use all of them so i ended up putting less sour cream and more mashed bananas. Overall is turned out great! Thank you

First, I am wondering if I was the only person who actually believed that this recipe was going to fill only four 7X3 inch loaves as stated?  Pans were ready - mix was voluminous - oh MY - more pans, quick!  Next, the temperature was not high enough to bake the inside without burning the outside.  It was O.K. but nothing extraordinary.  I think it should have made four 7X4 pans of bread!  Someone could not have tested this out before posting it.

This banana bread is out of this world.  My husband brought one loaf into work and his coworkers devoured it (and asked for more); my mother took another loaf and said it was the BEST and the other loaf was eaten rather quickly by my husband and I and my 2 year old neice (who kept saying, "MORE" after every bite.  This recipe is definately a keeper and will be used over and over again.  THANK YOU!!

I was disappointed with this recipe. It was not GREAT, it was alright. I have had MUCH better banana bread with less work and ingredients. It was ok but I certainly would not consider this a 5 star recipe.

The best banana bread I have ever baked. I have been looking for a great recipe for a long time that tastes like the bread my Mom used to make and believe me this one is better, sorry Mom! My husband said to throw out my other recipes. It is so moist, I think the sour cream does it and I love the cinnamon sprinkled on the pan. I even used some on the top. I did not alter the recipe except I used 3 larger pans instead of the 4 pans and had to bake 5 minutes longer. I will be baking more tomorrow for my son and family, yummy. This one is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing this.

This banana bread recipe is fantastic.  I don't even like bananas, but my boyfriend wanted banana bread, and I think I ended up eating more of it than he did.  I sent this recipe to my mom to try, just because I'm so in love with it!

one of the best tasting things I have ever made.  And I am not a sweet person or a baker for that matter.  I am already saving some banana's to make this again.  I scaled the recipe back, I didnt want to make 4 loaves.  Awesome!!!

My husband said this is the best Banana Bread he has ever eaten.  I had 4 bananas and no loaf pans so I halfed the recipe, threw in the extra banana, and baked it in a bunt pan.  Turned out great!  I am making this for family Christmas presents.  I only had fat-free sour cream on hand so I added a heaping tablespoon of sofened margarine.  The moisture was perfect.

i had trouble in the end when i was mixing the banana mixture with the flour.  i couldnt get everything to gel together.  its like the flour would get stuck in the folds of the banana mixture.  anyway, as i was pouring the mixture into the loaf pans, there were still poofs of flour popping up.  i have never made banana bread before so i wasnt sure if this was right.  but i mixted it until my hand hurt.  anyway, i baked it (for an hr and 15 min) and it still came out nice and yummy.  there were still little spots of flour that you can see in the bread though lol  edit: i also sprinkled some of the sugar/cinn mixture on top of the loafs before i baked.

We all liked this, served warm with melted butter.  However it needed to be cooked longer than the recipe states.  The inside was not done.

A+++  I have to say when I started to cream the butter/sugar and then added bananas I was a little skeptical.  I was wrong... this is the BEST banana bread recipe I have ever made.  Moist delicious!  Given my loaf pan size I cooked it for an hour and a half.  I still made 4 loaves out of it.  And coating the pan with cinnamon/sugar was a neat idea.

Super delicious! The only change I made was: split each pan's portion in half; inbetween the two halves, put a layer of chicken chips. And make sure you use the sugar/cinnamon dust on top before you make. This was my first time making banana bread, and I have a feeling I'll be doing it again soon!

The taste was incredible, so I gave it 5 stars. I did the no-nos of using applesauce instead of butter, and nonfat sour cream. It stayed pretty raw in and I cooked it for way over an hour. In the end it was still pretty gooey in the middle, but that was from my adaptations, I'm sure. The flavor itself is delish.

Very tasty! I baked it at 325 for 1 hr, 10 min. I also used the topping from the frist review. I wasn't that crazy about. I will make another topping next time.

My husband went to the store and bought me more bananas so that I could make this again.  So needless to say, he loved it as well as the rest of us did.  Thanks for submitting

Wonderful! I made this for a EcoPeace event at my college, so I lowered the sugar to 2 cups, and added some wheat germ to the mixture used to flour the pans, as well as to the mix itself. I used all whole wheat flour, and added a half tsp. of each to the mix: ground cloves, ginger, allspice, nutmeg. drizzled with vanilla glaze. looked and tasted lovely. thanks for the recipe! will make again!

This was pretty good, I would not say it was the best. I followed the directions exactly, EXCEPT that I baked it at 325 degress for  1 1/2 hours (as suggested by another reviewer).  Next time I make Banana Bread I will certiainly try out a different recipe.

Very moist and tasty! Easy recipe to follow although I did have to increase cook time about an extra 30 minutes. Kept for a few weeks and still tasted great!

Fantastic recipe! The cinnamon sugar on the pan was such a delicious addition! I increased to 7 bananas and substituted 2c whole wheat flour and 2.5c AP flour for all white flour. I made the full recipe in 2 loaf pans and a 4 mini loaf pan which was great for teacher gifts. I baked the mini loaves 45 mins and the big loaves 1hr. 15mins. Delicious and not too bad for you :)

This was scrumptious and all family members agree.  My son was skeptical when he saw me mixing in sour cream but agreed it made it moist an delicious.  I made it in a 9x13 metal pan and cut it into 4 equal rows across and 1/2" pieces.  Some went to work with my husband and none was left after lunchtime.  I did substitute 1 cup Equal sweetener because I ran out of sugar and it was still great!

I love this bread! I made for our church but I only have one loaf pan so I did the rest in muffins. I did make two changes however. Since I was making muffins I only put in 2 tsp of baking powder and added 3/4 tsp of cream of tarter. They puffed up pretty well, and they were really fluffy tasting. I just put them in with the loaf at 325 and they went for about 25-30 min and when the second batch of muffins came out the bread was done too. I also saw the review to add walnuts, I am not the biggets fan of them, so I added 1 cup crushed pecans. Oh they are good in there. And my five year old eliminates things from his diet regularl, he is now a vegitarian while we  are all meat lovers, and he loves these. I am going to make these all the time and freeze them for his breakfast.

My husband said this was the BEST banana bread he has ever had.  The only changes I made were to use 'light' sour cream and instead of 3 cups of sugar, I used 1 1/2 cups of Splenda Blend.  Because I only had 1 stick of butter left, I used that and then used unsweetnened applesauce for the remainder of the 'butter' use.  It came out delicious!  Thank you!

I have made many variations of banana bread.  This recipe is one of the best.  The bread is moist and flavorful.  I really like dusting the pans with cinnamon sugar, too.  This is much better than dusting with flour!

It tastes good, but like other reviews mine wasn't done after cooking.  I even extended the cook time an add'l 10 minutes. It was real doughy throughout even after the 10 add'l minutes.

This recipe makes a lot of bread, but it was all very good.  I had one full-sized loaf, 12 regular muffins and probably 24 small muffins.  It remained super moist.  I did not have any issues with it being raw in the center of the loaf...but I cooked it 15-20 minutes longer than stated in the recipe. I still like my mama's recipe best, but this is great banana bread!

I am going to try this recipe the next time I make banana bread.  I have my stepmother's recipe and it calls for sour milk.  I know you can make it sour by adding vinegar, but I choose to put half a cup of sour cream instead and I loved it.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Love this recipe! I didn't have sour cream but it was good anyway. I did dust my pans with powdered sugar and cinnamon...it really makes a difference. i also put some on top before baking with crushed walnuts...YUMMY! Halved oil with butter. Can't wait to try with sour cream for EXTRA moistness.

This recipe was good, but not quite as spectacular as I thought it was going to be because of alot of the reviews. I cut it in half, so I only made two loaves...one with nuts, the other with chocolate chips. I haven't tried the one with nuts yet, and I am eager to see which one is better! :)

300 degrees is too low. Both loaves were raw in the center. Should have used 350 right off the bat.

Very good recipe!  I made half the recipe and used wide-mouth pint size glass canning jars to bake it.  (Add lid when slightly cooled and they make great gifts!)  I will use a little less cinnamon next time as I'm not a huge cinnamon fan.  I decreased the sugar by half a cup, increased the vanilla by 1/2 tsp, added 1/2 tsp almond extract and used 1 cup of pecans.  This bread rose a lot more than I'd expected (maybe b/c my sour cream had been opened for a few days) so be sure to leave plenty of room for rising.  (Mine overflowed the jars and filled the oven with smoke!!)  Even with my oven mishap this bread came out great!

This bread was great.  I made it in disposable 8x4inch pans and it made 4 nice sized breads. It is lighter than traditional banana bread.  I brought one loaf to my office and it was gone within 30 minutes of my arrival.  Lots of people asked for the recipe.  If you have 6 very ripe bananas available, make this cake.

The best Banana Bread that I've ever had. I was able to make two regular loaves plus two small loaves. I baked them at the same time at 325 degree for 1 hour and 10 minutes.

This is amazing! The cinnamon/sugar coating give a little crunch to this otherwise very moist bread. I cut the recipie by a 1/4 because I only have 1 bread pan (and can't eat any more than that before it goes bad). My measurements were a little off, but it still turned out wonderful. Will make again and again!

I tried this recipe because a friend of mine said it was yummy. She was absolutely right! I could have eaten a whole loaf in one sitting and still wanted more! The only thing I did differently was add more vanilla (I love vanilla - can't ever have too much!) and put the cinnamon/sugar mixture on the top as well as the sides.

I really like the cinnamon taste because it adds a little zing to the bannana taste. I have made this twice and the loaves freeze very well.

This was a delicious banana bread recipe! The only change I made was increasing the butter by 1/2 c. This produced a very tender crumb and a crisp exterior.

Not the healthiest banana bread out there, but when you're going for flavor and texture you can't beat this recipe!  It's moisture is uniform....there were no mushy parts which sometimes happens when I make banana bread.  I will definitely make it again.

We liked this recipe, and the cinnamon was a nice addition. The texture came out a little rubbery for me though, and it was so moist that it was almost wet. We enjoyed it, but we like our banana bread to be a little sweeter. Next time I would sub pecans for the walnuts, and I think I'd add the cinnamon/sugar to the top as well. I love that it makes 4 loaves, enough to share with the office!

This is exactly what it promised...moist and delicious. I was leary about the sour cream but it turned out beautifully. I added chocolate chips for an extra kick and used vegetable oil because I was out of butter. This was fab!

This is soo very good.  It has a light texture with a lot of banana flavor.  Brought as a hostess gift.  One of her guests was an owner of a bakery and thought that it was the best she has eaten.  She said that with her mother right there.  lol.   A must!

By far the best banana bread I've ever made.  I added 1 cup of mini semi sweet chocolate chips.  It was wonderful, but beware it makes 4 loaves of bread.  I have only two loaf pans so I made muffins too.  Thanks I will keep the recipe close at hand.

Great bread!I've tried many banana bread recipes and this one is by far the BEST! I did decrease the sugar to only 2 cups and it was plenty sweet enough. I also used Rapadura instead of white sugar to make it healthier. I only put in 4 bananas instead of 6 because that's all I had and it was fine. Next time I will try it with the full amount. I used 2  9 by 5 glass pans filled 3/4 full and with the rest of the batter I filled 6 mini rectangular muffin pans. I baked those for about 40 minutes and the      9 by 5s for 1 hour all at 325 degrees. I frooze some for my husbands lunch for a later date and I'm glad I did because he loved the bread and can't wait till I make some more. Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome!!!  I did not have enough sour cream, so to make up the difference I added yogurt.  I also added a little bit more cinnamon and some chocolate chips.  Did not add the nuts.  Perfect.

I also had trouble with this recipe .. although I did take the advice of using applesauce (low fat version) and doing half of the recipe. I baked at 300 F for 45 minutes longer than the hour recommended, and it was still too moist / heavy.  Next time I'll try at a higher temperature.

Mine ended up pretty flat, but the taste was amazing anyways! I used half brown sugar because I ran out of white (who runs out of white sugar??) and I added chopped rhubarb instead of nuts b/c I have tons to use up.....sooooo yummy!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I added chocolate chips and have to admit that I found myself unable to stop eating this!  This will be my go-to banana bread recipe forever. Thanks.

i consider myself a banana bread fanatic, and loved this recipe.  I looked at other comments and I did make a few changes-I folded in the dry ingredients and added the strusel topping, and baked 3 (meat loaf sized)9x5,I think, pans for 1 hour 10 minutes.  PERFECT !!!!

I really liked this bread, especially how moist it was. I thought it tasted too much like cinnamon though, because I sprinkled it on top too (it was excellent cinnamon bread!). It kept well in the fridge for a week. I used 2 cups demerara sugar instead of white and added some applesauce with less butter, which made it feel healthier.

Although it is very moist, I thought the consistancy to be more of bread pudding than a bread. I was disappointed.

This was so good and easy... I had 2 black bananas on hand and instead of pitching them I stirred up 1/4 of this recipe in less than 10 min.  Put the pan in the oven on time bake while I went off to work, and had a lovely banana nut bread waiting when I got home!

I have made this recipe four times now. It always turns out great and I am not the best at baking. I agree to bake at 325 for 1 hour 10min. I used the suggested crumb topping and it was awesome. Last time I cut the it in half and baked at 325 for almost an hour. I feel like this is a hard one to mess up.

Yum-O! Best banana bread, hands down!  It tastes exactly like the bread they serve warm at Mimis restaurants.  The sour cream and the amount of bananas in this recipe makes it so moist and Banana-ey.  I did do Saras suggestions with the topping.  Super duper wonderful recipe, thank you for sharing! :)

Absolutely fabulous!!!!!!!! So good and stays so moist. I would suggest this recipe to people who don't even like banana bread.  It reminds me of my sister-in-laws New Zealand banana cake.

It was so good. I took some to work, my co-workers just went crazy over it. I did modify a little bit. I added 1/8 cup of flax seed and used 1/2 part all purpose flour and 1/2 part whole wheat.

Only five stars if you set the oven at 325 for an hour and five minutes.  Otherwise this would have been raw in the center.  I didn't have any vanilla, and I used reduced fat sour cream, still moist and not too sweet.  I added a crumb topping, which was a nice finish.

I baked this a couple of weeks ago, and everyone loved it.  I did, however, bake this at 325 degrees for 1 hour 25 minutes, and it came out perfect.  I baked one loaf pan and a bundt pan.  It was so good that I am actually baking it again today!

This recipe makes a pretty good, moist banana nut bread! But like a lot of people who gave lower ratings, I had a lot of trouble trying to get the bread to bake all the way at 300 deg for an hour. I had to let it sit in there for 300 deg for 1.5 hours and the top started to get too crisp so I turned it down to 280 for another half hour. Took about 2 hours total but still turned out pretty good.  Also, I noticed it's easier to mash the bananas PRIOR to mixing in with the rest of the recipe.

Delicious, moist and flavorful!  Next time I think I will increase the salt to 1 tsp, but other than that, these loaves were perfect!

I made this for the first time and it is awesome...I made it exactly as written and my family had a whole loaf gone almost instantly.  I sent a loaf to my sister and promised my mom a loaf...wish I wouldn't have, because  now I'm going to have to make some more today...oh well.  Thanks for the recipe!

This banana bread is so good, everyone in my family loved it even my picky husband.I am about to make it again for the second time this week, because the first time it was gone so quick.I also used this cinnamon sugar sprinkle from pampered chef on top and it made a great topping.

Wonderful recipe.  I used 8oz fat-free sour cream and 8oz lite sour cream, and it was very moist.  Sprayed pans with Pam and then sprinkled 1/2 the sugar mixture on bottom and sides.  Other 1/2 of sugar sprinkled on top of the loaf once poured into pans.  Instead of mixing the walnuts in I put them on top of batter with the sugar mixture.  They rose perfectly and tasted fabulous.  Definitely a keeper!

Best Bread I have ever made!  Super easy and delicious.  Search no more, you have to try this one!  I have to say, you may as well make all the full recipe.  You will want more once you try it.

This was really good, I could only use 5 bananas because that was all I had, but it turned out just great anyhow =] I made it into one loaf and then used the rest for muffins. I did have to cook the loaf alot longer than stated in the recipe, at least 2.5 hours, not sure why?

Love this recipe!  I was looking for a slightly less traditional version of banana bread.  Made it last night.  When the in-laws came over for a visit they begged to take some home with them!

Wow, loved this banana bread!  I halved the recipe and added 1 cup of chocolate chips, a dash of nutmeg, and a dash of ground cloves...baked at 325 for 1 hour 10 minutes...came out perfectly!  Definitely a keeper!

This is the best banana nut bread I've ever had since it's perfectly moist. Instead of using the full amount of sugar, I used 1/3 of what is called for and the rest was splenda (full scale: 1 cup sugar, 2 cups splenda). I also used light sour cream and cut out the salt. It comes out perfectly after an hour. This is a very easy recipe even when you scale it down to one loaf.

This recipes was ok.  I have an easier banana bread that doesn't use sour cream that I have been using for years and I think it is much better than this one, as did the rest of my family.

I would have to agree with others. This is not your typical banana bread recipe. It has to be the best that I have ever had~with the richness of the sour cream and the sweetness of the cinnamon & sugar sprinkled in the pan to cook on the outside. It's simply wonderful!

This is really good bread and a great use for slighly old bananas.  I cut the recipe in half but used two eggs and a stick of butter (slightly more than is called for).  I can't stop eating it!! I would highly reccomend this recipe.  I did have to turn the oven up at the end though.  After 45 mintues at 300 the middle was far from cooked.  Up to 350 for the last fiftenn solved that...

This recipes is great the loaves turn out super moist with tons of flavor. I didn't powder the pan mainly cause I just didn't think it needed to be done, they still were fantastic. They freeze very well too.

This is superb!!!  You have to make it with the crumb topping as well but otherwise, I make it exactly as written.  It freezes well, but the top gets a little mushy when taken out of the freezer  with the crumb topping.  Great gifts too.  Will probably make some for the holidays.

I've made this a few times and the flavor is very good and it's very moist.  But the tops are always very sticky and gooey after the first day of making it.  It makes it difficult to store.

Vary good, this recipe came out great! I took some of it to a friend and she couldn’t believe that a man could make something that good. I’m going to make it again and take it to the girls in dance class; maybe I’ll get lucky. lol

I printed this recipe years ago. I make it often throughout the year. During the holidays I end up making it about 2-3 times per week! My husband (and his friends) love it, so do the kids. I have never had problems making this recipe. I also spinkle the cinnamon & sugar on the top and then spinkle some more walnuts in a row on top before baking. The recipe makes 9 of the small or mini loafs, I've also make 3 mini loafs and the rest in a small rectangle (my brownie) pan. Then I cut it into 4 loafs. I love this recipe, it's my all time favorite from this site. Thank you!

This is absolutely the best banana bread.  My family always looks forward to our banana's going bad because they know that this bread is on its way!

This was a big hit!  I scaled the recipe down to 1/3 the original and it made one standard loaf perfectly.

I had to half it because I didn't have 4 pans. Although it fit in 1 pan and my husband sore it would be ok, I should have used 2 pans! Also, I had to cook significantly longer and eventually turned oven up to 325.

I like this recipe. I made three big loaves of this and it is just great. I added toasted walnuts pieces and it turned out great. Took it to work to feed to the coworkers and they all loved it, too. Very moist and even better the next day.

Very good.  My other recipe uses a lot of oil, I guess the sour cream replaces that - it was very moist.  I add a handful of chocolate chips, the kids love it.

I accidentally sort of massacred this recipe, and it still came out fantastically. I wanted to halve it, but I ended up using 1/2 cup butter. I also used brown sugar Splenda blend, about 6 oz of yogurt in place of the sour cream, and two large bananas. I also added some oats instead of the nuts. Baked at 350 for 65 minutes in a 9x5" pan.

I had sour cream and banana so I was searching for a recipe which contain these two main ingrediants! I tried this recipe and It is really wonderful! This bread is really soft, moist, light! I took half of the ingrediants and I deduce little amount of suger. Recipe suggested 1-1/2 cup suger and I used 1 cup + 1 table spoon suger also 1-1/2 eggs were suggested I took 2 eggs and It came fluffy and perfect sweet. Everybody Loved it! I don't eat cakes usually but I had one bite of it and I gobble another one :)! Its delicious! Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

These loaves were really moist and my husband is saying this is the best banana bread I've ever made.  A few changes that I made: I used 3 standard loaf pans and baked at 325 for 1 hour and 10 minutes. Unlike other reviewers, the loaves were perfectly cooked, not doughy.  I didn't have sour cream so I used non-fat plain yogurt, I added 2 tsp. of nutmeg and 1 tsp. of cloves.  Thanks for the great recipe, I will make this again!

This is a FANTASTIC banana nut bread! I made nine 5 and 5/8'' X 3 and 3/16'' X 1 and 15/16'' mini loaf pans with the above recipe. It is so moist and flavorful! The dusting of cinnamon sugar on the pans creates a wonderful flavor around the edges of the bread. This was the first time I have ever made banana nut bread and I cannot believe how easy it was. I gave the loaves out as gifts and have received rave reviews and EVERYONE wants the recipe. I kept one for us to try before we gave them as gifts and my husband devoured it! Again, this is a wonderful recipe and so easy a beginner, like myself, can create something delicious in the kitchen!

This is the best banana bread ever!  Since pan sizes vary, you may have to bake a bit longer.  Be patient, it is worth the wait.  Use a toothpick to test for doneness.  These are also great as muffins.

Delicious bread but I messed it up.  First of all I halved the recipe and made two loaves.  I was supposed to put in 1 1/2c sugar but I accidentally used 2c.  I don't use regular sugar, instead I used turbinado sugar aka raw cane sugar. I used this sugar for the dusting of the pans and it provided a slight crunch to each bite.  Taking the bread out when there is just a little dough on the knife after baking allows for a more moist bread. I am a novice baker but I think this bread turned out well.  Other than the sugar change and using 5 bananas instead of 3.....I love the banana flavor, it turned out well.  I baked it at 325 for 55 minutes.  Happy baking.

Omg.... this was soooo good!!!!  So good!  Everyone couldn't get enough of it and I used a suggested comment for the topping by mixing flour and brown sugar and butter and put it on top before baking and that was probably the best part!  Yummy!

I gave it a 5 star. Only I halved the recipe, using 16 servings, 2 eggs and 4 bananas. I also added in a packet of banana pudding powder. And I baked them at 325 for a little over an hour. It came out perfect!

Wow, absolutely fantastic!!  I am not sure the sugar and cinnamon coated pan is really a necessity, but other than that it is really good.  I had 12 people over and we had tons of good food -- it was the first to go.

Great recipe.  Super easy and really yummy!  I used chocolate chips instead of walnuts which made it even better :)

Tastes great.  Only down side is it gets soggy almost sweaty the next day.  If you are serving this to guests, do it the first day.  Just for you and family, does not matter if it is a little sweaty because the taste is still great.

I love Banana Bread and this recipe sounds really good. I tried SaraLady19 hint using the crumb topping on 2 loaves, wish me luck I'm sure it will come out fine. If this doesn't come out good I'll repost telling of my failure, if not complete success!

Absolutely the BEST banana bread recipe I have ever had. I only made 2 loaves and used 2 whole eggs instead of 1-1/2. It took about 10 minutes longer to cook, but the result was flawless.

Everyone at work loves this bread.  People chase me down asking for the recipe and asking me to make it again!  I now bake it in a very large meatloaf pan to get a really big loaf.  It's massvie and they just love the size and the taste.

Very tasty and freezes well. The cinnamon and sugar dusting makes these really flavourful and the sour cream add a good amount of moisture. Have made these into full loaves, mini loaves, muffins, and mini muffins. All were good. Make sure you  use FULL FAT sour cream or you won't be getting the best part of what this recipe offers. I give this 4 stars because while it is a great recipe, it isn't the best I've had. This does freeze the best of any other I have tried, though.

Very good! Everyone loved it. I accidentally added baking powder instead of soda but then added soda too. It came out excellent. I read some had problem getting it rise, so maybe the extra baking powder helped mine. I used two larger pans and 1/2 recipe. I baked with 325 for 1hour 10min. The rest was exactly like in recipe.

I switched half the flour to whole wheat, used fat free sour cream, half the sugar as splenda and some of the butter I switched for applesauce but it was still moist and delicious!

Fantastic recipe.  I mashed the bananas as someone suggested, and it worked out fabulously.  I used buttermilk instead of sour cream only because I didn't have the latter.  It turned out great, so I'm going to continue using buttermilk.  My husband loved it, and he doesn't like banana nut bread!

Yes, another awesome review! Now when I see a banana that looks a little old, I throw it in the freezer so I can make this.  I have enough bananas to make a couple loafs so when it gets cooler outside, I will be a baking machine.  Everyone LOVED this recipe!

So when I saw this recipe I was blown away with the sour cream idea... I tinker in the kitchen, but not much more...BBQ is where it is at for me!  I cut this recipe in half and put the mixture a larger bread pan.  With the leftover batter I made cupcakes to have my 6 year old take to neighbors just to tempt them about what we were doing.  Both turned out perfectly.  One thing I did different is brush butter on top of loaf with about 10 minutes to go.. I got a great crust and then when it came out, we brushed some and put the cinnamon/sugar mixture lightly on top... Huge hit!  My wife said she only wanted a slice but finished a couple and was snooping around the kitchen to see what was left.... Thanks for the recipe..

OH MY GOODNESS! This is the best banana bread I have ever had! It turned out perfect...perfect texture, height, soft but doesn't fall apart, and the taste, AMAZING! The only tiny thing is I only got three loaves out of it. Maybe my loaf pans are bigger than the others. But if that is the only drawback to this recipe, I will take it! I am SO GLAD I took the time to make this recipe!

Family loved it... great banana bread best recipe I have used.  Lowered sugar to 1 1/2 cups, cooked at 325 in a glass pan if using heavy bread pan then recommend 350 for an hour.  Turned out great.

I have been cooking for years, but never got into baking. I recently asked my girlfriend if I could make anything for her...and she said Bananna Bread...I got a little scared as I have NEVER made anything in an oven. I found this recipe...and made it. She said she would be pretty harsh on judging it...as it is her favorite thing in the world...and she LOVED this recipe!!! It came out moist, full of flavor and balanced well.

THANK YOU!!! This is my new secret weapon.

This was my first banana bread recipe.  I was attracted by the sour cream and I wasn't disappointed.  It is so moist and delicious.  The sugar coating really adds something special.  I felt like a true gourmet when I made this, and will never use another banana bread recipe!

Very good bread.  The sour cream does give it a unique taste that everyone loves.  I also use apple sauce instead of oil.

The taste is AWSOME and I even added mini chocolate chips.  I made 12 cupcakes and three mini loafs to freeze.  I was BUMMED however because they didn't rise and get puffy, then fell flat after removed from the oven, did I overmix the batter???  I blended all the ingredients with a hand mixer then folded in the flour and baking soda....

CRAZY GOOD.  Now, my kids won't eat bananas.  They want them to ripen so I'll make the bread.  It is the biggest hit I have ever baked.  I might give loaves as gifts at Christmas time.

Okay, so I got  the bright idea of making this with a couple of mini sous chefs...and they did such a good job helping me that it wasnt until we had everything in the pans before I realised that...(DUH!) I hadnt put the baking soda in. So after dumping it all back in the bowl, resugaring the pans, and firing said sous chefs...I figured the bread was a flop...but it turned out amazing! Everyone loves it, and I am beyond happy. Definitely keeping this recipe!

Yummy and moist, but still just "another banana bread recipe." I could not taste the cinnamon sugar coating very well, and it makes the sides and bottom sticky so I will skip that step next time. Even if it wasn't special for me, one of my guests whooped "this is so good I could slap my mama!" (It was a compliment)

Loved this recipe.  I halved it, but used 2 eggs (it's hard to half an egg!).  I baked 2 loaves at 325 for 70 minutes.  I loved the dusting of sugar and cinnamon in the pan and also used some cinnamon sugar on top of the loaves.  Very tender, yummy loaves!  This is my new go to overripe banana recipe!

So wonderful!!! Cut the recipe and it made two mediums sized loaves.  Perfect.  Almost didn't coat the pan with cinnamon sugar.  So glad I did, it add so much.  Everyone fights over the end pieces now.

This banana bread is pretty good.  I halved the recipe and used three 7.5 inch x 4 inch loaf pans.  Some previous reviewers claimed that they had trouble getting the bread to cook all the way through.  It seems like this batter yields more than stated in the recipe. I used whole milk plain yogurt instead of sour cream because I had it on hand.  Next time I will try with sour cream to see if it makes the recipe better.

This is the best!!!  I omited the nuts because my family doesn't like them and it was still delish!  Warm out of the oven it melts in your mouth.  I also halved the recipe and only used one egg.  It was still nice.

You know, I'm a much better cook than a baker and it showed with this recipe.  I followed it to the letter.  It tasted great the first day, but the 2nd it kindof tasted funny.  I think I'll stick with my mom's recipe for now.

This was so yummy! Only change I made was using splenda rather than sugar. I took a loaf over to my in-laws since father in law is diabetic and it was a big hit! 
I also made it at work but used sugar and had to substitute chopped macadamia nuts for the walnuts and it turned out very well also.

This has really good flavor.  My family loved it but my husband said it had too much sugar.  I liked the cinnamon sugar crust but he said that made it too sweet.  I also did a crumble topping with flour, butter and brown sugar from another recipe on this site.  That may have just made it too much, but having a sweet tooth, I enjoyed it and my kids couldn't get enough!

The bread turned out quite yummy!  I made 2 with nuts, 2 without to suit the family's tastes.  I did have to leave them in about 30 more minutes to get them cooked thru but it was well worth it!

Well, I hate to go against the grain, so to speak, but I have a MUCH better banana nut bread recipe that I'm going to submit to allrecipes.  I had the same problem as others with this one not getting done in the middle. I cooked at 325 for 1 hour, 35 mins, and the middle still wasn't done.  I shielded the bread with tin foil after about 45 mins in the oven to keep the top from burning.  I was just disappointed about the inconsistency of the loaf after so long in the oven, however, the part that did get done tasted fine.  Not "knock your socks off" or anything, but ok.  I did enjoy the cinnamon sugar coating that was on the bottom and sides of each piece.  :)  Ok to try, but I think I'll stick with my tried and true. Thanks though!

I cut this in half to make one loaf. 

Only thing different I did was bake it at 350* for about an hour. I didn't think
that it would cook all the way through at 300* and I wanted to prevent wasted ingredients. Oh, and I added a little nutmeg in with the cinnamon when I made the batter. 

I found this recipe just okay. I wasn't overwhelmed with it and neither was my family.

with all of the reviewers advice i took it came out great! i got 5 loafs using 6x9 loaf pans. I used nonfat sour cream, a dash of ground cloves and nutmeg, 2 cups of sugar in the raw (instead of 3 cups of white sugar), about 7 ounces of semi sweet chocolate chips and baked it at 325 for an hour. these are perfect for freezing, baby on the way and i wont have time to bake for awhile.

This recipe was amazing. My husband raved about how it was the best banana bread he has ever tasted. One thing I did that we all loved was not mash the bananas completely so that there were moist banana pieces every few bites of the bread. This was absolutely decicious. LOVED THIS RECIPE!!! Baking it again right now in my oven.

This is the best recipe for banana bread ever.  It is very moist, not overly sweet and extremely easy to make.  This recipe makes four loaves that freeze beautifully. Some in my family cannot eat nuts so I make a crumb topping similar to what other users recommend except I use coconut instead of nuts.  For four loaves I use 1 c. packed brown sugar ~ 1 c. flour ~ 6 T. softened butter ~ 2 t. cinnamon ~ 2/3 c. shredded coconut.  Mix these ingredients together with a fork until crumbly and spoon evenly over loaves before baking.  My family goes "bananas" over this bread!

Very good!  I made 12 muffins & 2 loaves. The dusting of cinnamon sugar creates a wonderful crust. Very moist

by far the BEST banana bread I've ever had.  this bread is incredibly moist and sooooo good with coffee for breakfast.  also, since each batch makes so much, i gave them to my kids' teachers for Christmas!!  They freeze very nicely too.

This was so moist and delicious!  I baked my banana bread in two medium size bundt pans, and 3 mini loaf pans- cuts down cooking time in half!  My family loves banana bread, and have always used a recipe with a lot of oil- not anymore, we will be making this banana bread from now on!

Just made this recipe a little bit ago and it is almost gone! I only had two ripe bananas on hand, so i reduced the servings to "8" making only one loaf, used 1 egg, and baked in oven at 300 degrees for 50 minutes. This will be the recipe I will use for banana bread from now on. Thank you for sharing it!

This was very yummy. The only thing I did differently was to use 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup canola oil.  I think you could actually put this into three loaf pans and make them a bit taller, but I will have to try that next time.  Thanks for a great, super moist, banana bread.  We loved it.

I made my first banana bread a couple weeks ago, my husband wouldn't eat it.  This recipe was gone(I had one slice) is a day and a half.  I was worried about a couple reviews that said it didn't rise, so I added some baking powder as well, had no problems.  I used a 9x5 loaf pan, halfing the recipe, which was perfect for the size of the pan.  My second loaf is in the oven now, making my kitchen smell wonderful...thanks for the great recipe.

This is the BEST recipe for banana bread.  There is no need to make any changes to the recipe. Make it exactly like it says, and it will turn out amazing.  Everyone loves this banana bread and says it is the best they've ever had.

This is such good bread! i cut the recipe in half. I used only 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/2, 1 egg and 1 egg white, fat free sour cream, coconut instead of vanilla extract, and whole wheat flour. It ended up being healthy , filling and amazing tasting. My sister said she liked it better with the coconut than regular banana bread. I will definatly make this again and maybe add some crushed pineapple so its like a hawaiain bread. mmmmm! 

Update: When i made this a the second time, i made the whole batch. For that i used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup of olive oil in place of the butter, 1  cup of sugar, fat free sour cream, and whole wheat flour. I also used 1 egg and 3 egg whites. 3 cups of sugar would be WAYYYY too sweet. I think the key to adding the sweetness without the sugar is extremely ripe bananas.

This was really good.  Overall this was one of the best banana bread recipes I've come across.  I only gave it 4 stars because the best banana bread belongs to Howard Johnson's.  Already have plans to make this again.

WOW!  i have never made homemade banana bread before and i was so PROUD of myself after making this recipe.  I gave 4 stars only because i haven't had many banana breads so there might just be a better one out there but this is, to date, the BEST i've ever had.  thanks for the recipe.

I used pumpkin spice and some nutmeg.  Hand mixed it- very dense and bread like if you don't use the electris mixer.  Made two loaves and they are pretty much gone!

I scaled this down to 16 servings (1/2).  However, the amount of sour cream stayed at 16 oz for 1/2 instead of going to 8 oz.  I didn"t catch it until after I had baked it.  It turned out ok, but I'll try it with 8 oz next time.

cut the recipe down signifigantly to make just one loaf, and per another reviewer's suggestion, used 4 oz of sour cream. Took about an hour and fifteen minutes to bake at 300 but came out very moist. Worked wonderfully!

The flavor is wonderful.  I made the recipe as is.  I would suggest reducing to a 1/2 recipe unless you feed an entire army.

so delicious and moist!  my first time making banana bread and it was great :)  i didn't have any baking soda so i used baking powder instead, doubled the amount, and didn't add the salt.  it still didn't really rise though, but who cares when it tastes this good??

This banana bread is the bomb! I have tried out 2 other mediocre recipes from this site (despite great reviews), but this one is def the best.

I made some changes: I baked the entire batter in one large bundt pan, adjusted the baking time to 165 Celsius and baked for 1 hour, then on 150 Celsius for another 30 minutes. It definitely needed the extra time to be thoroughly done.

I also reduced the sugar, about 200 grams less in metric form, and it was definitely sweet enough with the very ripe bananas. So I would suggest using much less sugar at first, and adding more if you find it not sweet enough. I think it would be too sweet for my taste with the called for amount. I also added extra spices like nutmeg, clove, and cardamom.

This cake really tastes like bananas! It's very flavourful, moist, but still fluffy. I left out the walnuts and am glad I did, the banana flavour is enough for me. I used completely brown, mushy bananas which were ready to be thrown away, which were perfect for this! Great recipe, thanks for sharing. :)

Don't use the sugar/cinnamon coating on the bread.  It's too sweet!  Besides that, this bread is really good.  Extra vanilla and cinnamon.  Lots of walnuts.  Used only whole wheat flour and brown sugar.  EXCELLENT!!!!  Husband devoured a loaf all by himself in less than an hour.  Family and friends love it.  

UPDATE: 2012---not so good.  Very mushy and all we tasted was sour cream.  Found another banana bread to die for.  Thanks Allrecipes.  :P

UPDATE: 2014--Delicious!!!  Used Greek yogurt and applesauce instead of the sour cream.  Moist and tasty!!!!

I was specifically looking for a sour cream banana bread that looked like my grammas recipe and I found it!  I hate the dry cakey crumbly stuff, this was velvety and moist!  We didn't have walnuts so I thrwu in slivered almonds and it was wonderful!  As soon as I get more walnuts I will use that as an exuce to make it again!  This one is going in my recipe box as a keeper!

My mom used to make banana bread when I was a kid and she says she can't remember the recipe.  Well I came on here and found this one.  I've made this a few times already and again tonight.  I love it!  Tastes just how I remember.  I was feeling a little chocolaty so I tossed in a few handfulls of chocolate chips and it was delish!!!

Loved this recipe! The only thing I did differently was used light sour cream instead of regular.  I have been looking for the right banana bread recipe. It turned out very moist and my family and friends loved it!

I love this recipe!  My husband and I like denser banana bread so I followed the suggestion from previous reviewer to fold dry ingredients in.  Kind of had to anyway because this is a SERIOUS amount of batter and wouldn't have fit combined in my kitchenaid mixer bowl.

I decided to use Chinese Five Spice (anise, star anise, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg) instead of cinnamon/nutmeg in recipes and previous suggestions and love the little spicy bite it gives.

The idea of the sugar/cinnamon "dusting" was wonderful.  I think I used too much but don't care because as it cooled it formed a crunchy crust!  Mmmmm...

Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

This was good and moist yes.  The top was really sticky and almost made it hard to eat.  I might make this again, but the Banana Bread recipe in the Joy of Cooking is still my fave hands down - and no sour cream so better for you!  For a treat, add mini chocolate chips to one of the loaves!

I have reviewed this before with 5+ stars but wanted to update. I baked with Splenda grandular and Splenda Brown Sugar Blend and my testers said it worked great. Didn't brown as well which made me unhappy but the taste was still good. Try the Splenda if you don't need the sugar.

This was the first banana bread I've ever made and I think I will stick with this recipe for years to come.  I halved the recipe and made two loaves and they came out awesome! Moist but with slightly crisp, sweet edges  I don't think that I have had a better tasting banana bread.  Thanks!

This recipe probably would have gotten 5 stars from me if the bake time was longer. My bread came out half raw after the time given. So I'd definitely make this again, but put it in for at least 10 more minutes.

I hate to review a recipe when I made an edited version, but this is such a good base recipe.  To cut some of the fat, I used low fat sour cream and substituted apple sauce for half of the butter.  I used over-ripe bananas that I had thrown in the freezer a few weeks ago and it turned out really well.  The texture is nice, it's moist and the flavor is EXACTLY what I want from a banana bread.

Excellent banana bread!  I made it with whole wheat flour, added flax meal and reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup to make the bread healthier.  I also add rasins to one loaf because I love rasins in banana bread.  I poured the bread into two regular sized loaf pans and the loaves cooked up nicely and came out moist.  I'm so glad I tried this recipe because the last two times I made banana bread with a different recipe the top came out too brown and the inside didn't cook enough.  I was beginning to think I couldn't make banana bread!

Although I was disappointed because I accidentally put in no fat plain yogurt instead of the reduced fat sour cream I was planning to use, this bread/cake still definitely rated a 5.  Sixty minutes in the oven wasn't enough, so I left it in for an additional ten or so, and it still seemed a bit "damper" on top than I would have liked, although by the end of the seventy minutes the toothpick came out clear. The bread also didn't rise as much as I would have liked, but that too might be related to the age of my baking soda, plus the fact that I was so anxious about overcooking the bread and kept checking the oven (I know, a no-no).  I definitely want to make this bread the way it was intended to be made, with sour cream, and I may even use full-fat sour cream next time!  This bread  has tremendous potential with more practice on my part, particularly if I incorporate the ideas of other reviewers here in terms of toppings, substitutes, etc.  Will definitely make this again!

I'm not usually a banana bread fan but I had a few ripe bananas I'd frozen for just such an occasion. I had a slight issue as the bread overflowed my small loaf pans, so I'd advise against filling anywhere approaching 3/4 full. I made three muffins in large muffin tins using leftover batter and they turned out beautifully. Other than my ugly loaves, the recipe was a winner. As an aside, the overflow that baked onto the baking sheet I used tasted amazing. It had gone crisp and I called the bits banana bread cookies. ;)

This is an excellent recipe but the texture is so moist and dense it seems to be more of a coffee cake than a quick bread. I prefer my banana bread to be more banana-y, but once I knew what to expect, it was wonderfully tasty.

Even better than my old favorite banana bread recipe.  I halved the recipe and put it into one 9x5 loaf pan, which required a longer cooking time.  I also halved the sugar (3/4 c. for the already halved recipe) and it was still sweet enough even for me, someone with a serious sweet tooth.  Next time I'll make the full batch because one loaf just isn't enough!

Right after baking it, had a piece of the bread and I thought it wasn't true to its claim of being moist. Placed it in the ref, and on my next slice, it was moist and yummy! My family and husband enjoyed it. Will be making this again

This was REALLY good and easy to make.  It even tasted better after a few days in the fridge!  It's not mushy and not too dense - just right!!  I baked it in foil pans and gave them away as little take-home "gifts" and they were a HUGE hit!!  Will definitely save this recipe and make it again and again!!

This recipe was great! It seems I'm always trying new banana bread recipes in search of the best one....this may be it! The sour cream made this very moist. We loved it. I also like the fact that this recipe made a few loaves. I have a big family so that was a plus!!!

This was the best Banana Bread I have ever made. I made 2 extra loaves and froze them to have for  Christmas morning. I was surprised at how well it held up.  My whole family wanted to know what I did to this banana bread to make it so good. I will bake this again and again.

I have a sour cream banana bread recipe that I've been using for years and I thought it was good, but this recipe is even better. I never would have thought to dust the pans with cinnamon and sugar mixture, what a great idea. It really makes a difference. I also sprinkled what was left of the mixture on top of the loaves. I made 3 standard size loaves from one batch of batter. Thanks for the recipe!

I halved the batch and made one with walnuts and one without.  It turned out wonderfully.  My only suggestion was to add more sour cream then it called for.  I like a more moist and heavier bread.  It turned out wonderfully.  People who dont usually like banana bread raved on mine.  

Great recipe.. try it ... you'll love it!!

Maybe too much to eat at once so I ended up freezing the 3 loaves and I still had a big one and one small!

This is good bread, but a little on the sweet side.  The sour cream does add a unique flavor, but I felt it kind of keeps the banana from being the "star" of this bread.  Good, but still not the "best".

wow!  simply delicious.  
I too made half the recipe using 2 eggs and 4 bananas as others suggested.  I added a 1/4 tsp of cake spice which added a bit of...well, spice. =)  
Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This is wonderfully moist, and stays moist.  I did make a few changes, though.  My bananas were very ripe, so I went with the amount of sugar in my "old standby" recipe--I started with 1 3/4 cups sugar.  3 cups would have been way too much!  Then I added 1/4 tsp. ground cloves and a couple dashes of nutmeg.  I also added about 1/2 tsp. baking powder.  I never would have thought of putting sour cream in my banana bread, but this just might become my new favorite!

Sour cream in banana bread is something I never thought of! But it's magic!

Wow, it doesn't get any better than this! Except if you like more cinnamon and nutmeg in the actual bread, but it was the most moist, delectable banana bread I have ever had, and I HATE banana bread!

This bread has a wonderful texture, moist without being too heavy.  It was a little too sweet for me, so next time I'll cut back the sugar if I'm such over ripe bananas.  Also, it needed to bake for 1.5 hours so a toothpick came out clean.

I had bananas that were a bit on the smallish side, so next time I'll use larger ones as I found this lacking some banana flavor.  The moistness is right on, though, and even though I was doubtful about dusting the pans with sugar - thinking the breads would stick - it's a nice touch and the loaves popped right out.  I will use that technique with some of my other bread recipes, and maybe use nutmeg or other spices.  Will definitely make this one again!

Excellent!  My family loves this recipe.  It's more like a cake, which they were all about.  It was very simple, and tastes like a gourmet bakery treat.  

Sprinkling cinnamon sugar both in the bottom of the pan and over the batter makes a perfect treat, as the sugar on top gets a bit of a crust to it, which traps moisture in the cake.  Yummy!

I did make this gluten-free to accommodate family allergies(adding 2 tsp of baking powder to help it rise better).  I also thought I'd be clever and add a 2 tsp of rum extract, but it wasn't discernable in the end. I'll be making this often. Thanks for sharing!!

I bet this would've been great had I cooked it according to the time and temp given, but I mistakingly took another users advice and cooked my 2 loaves at 325 for 1hr 10mins, and they were completely overdone and dry. I was so upset, this was supposed to be my contribution to Thanksgiving, needless to say I was ashamed to serve them, and ended up throwing them out. I will give this recipe another try but next time I will follow it "as written".

I followed the recipe exactly and it was truly amazing!!! I was a little nervous at first with all the sour cream, so I made a 1/2 recipe. Next time I will be making the whole recipe. My husband and I ate the 1/2 recipe in 3 days it was so delicious!

It was perfect! I cut the recipe in half thinking we'd never get through the 2 loaves. Well, I should have made both! I made the bread in the evening, and we had some after dinner. By the next morning at breakfast, my husband and his friends had devoured the entire loaf! I'll be making more this weekend! Thank you.

Yummy!  I cannot say enough good things about this banana bread.  It is certainly the best I have ever made.  I made two regular size loaves and baked for 65 minutes at 325.  I also had enough batter left to make two dozen mini-muffins.  Those were gone in less than 24 hours.  I did take the suggestion of another and added a dash of cloves.  I did not have nutmeg so I added a dash of pumpkin pie spice as well.  Even my picky toddler loved this recipe!  Thanks

This was good but didn't wow me.  I cut the recipe in half and used 4 bananas and 2 eggs.  It made 2 small loaves.  I omitted the cinnamon because I don't like it in banana bread.  It was one of the better banana bread recipes I have tried so I would probably make it again.

This was the most moist and flavorful banana bread that I've ever tasted. However, I did alter the recipe a tad bit.  What I did different was that I added some freshly ground nutmeg and some ground cloves.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Best banana bread ever. From the slightly crunchy, slightly sweet crust to the moist, heavy interior... Eat it warm slathered in butter for a little slice of heaven.

This was a wonderful recipe. I was able to make 2 loaves and 6 muffins. I think using some cinnamon/sugar to sprinkle on top works well too. I received raves on this. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is THE most delicious banana bread I've ever had, EVER.  My kids love it, and it is so easy to make.  I substitute whole wheat flour for 1/3 of the total flour, and it tastes just the same to me.  Even my husband, who dislikes quick breads of all kinds, ate many helpings of this at breakfast.

I really liked this banana bread.  It's very moist, and the cinnamon is such a nice touch.  I would like to comment, though, on the fact that on the title page, where you see the name of the recipe and a little blurb about it, it says something about it making "four small loaves", and that is not the case.  I filled up four small loaf pans and a regular loaf pan, and still had some batter left!

I love this banana bread.  I made this last weekend and took it to the soccer fields (I’m on the board and we have to be their all day) and everyone ate it up.  The adults and the kids all loved it.  I will be making this may more times.  Don’t skip the cinnamon and sugar part it taste great.

I thought this bread was great, but I didn't think it was amazing.  I did cut the recipe in half and baked in small loaf pans, and it came out a little drier than expected.  Next time I try regular loaf pans and see if it makes a difference.

Absolutely the best banana-nut bread I have ever tasted.  It was extremely moist and the sugar-cinnamon mixture on the top and bottom added for a delightful treat.  I made 4 loaves and plan on freezing 2 but they might not last that long :-).....I will definitely make this one again. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious.  I cut the recipe to make one loaf and am now kicking myself.  It was gone in less than an hour.  Very, very good!

This is absolutely wonderful.  It makes quite a lot.  My 18 year old ate a loaf at one setting! Very moist.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is the best banana bread recipe that I've ever come across. Anytime I make banana bread, this is the one I use. :) It's just perfect.

WONDERFUL!! My kids have told me this needs to go on the list of goodies we make for Christmas goodies.  Great way to get rid of  over ripened banana's.  Will make this year round; by far the best banana nut bread I have made.  Thank you for sharing the recipe. :)

Not the best I have had , but great, none the less.  I loved the cinnamon and sugar coating.  I also cut the sugar back to 2 1/2 cups.  I love that it made a lot, now I have some to freeze.  Yum!

Fantastic!  Great flavor and texture.  I made the half recipe with 2 very ripe bananas and an applesauce kids cup! Also used low fat sour cream.  Perfect amount in a 4 pack miniloaf stoneware pan.  Will make again and again.

This recipe is absolutely, without a doubt, a keeper.  I literally received a few marriage proposals out of it. ;o)  The bread is incredibly moist and delicious.  Be sure to use extremely ripe bananas, though...it makes all the difference!

Excellent bread!!  I goofed and left the eggs out of the recipe, but still ended up with a deliciously flavored bread.  I highly recommend this recipe (though next time I'll try making it healthier with applesauce and some whole wheat flour)!

I used 3 regular loaf pans with I buttered and dusted with flour. I only used 1 tsp. cinnamon and added extra walnuts in the mix and some on top. It was delicious. This recipe is a keeper!

This recipe surpassed my expectations. I halved the recipe, used slightly less sour cream and 2 eggs instead of the 1 1/2 eggs needed when halved. Also, I substituted 1/2 cup brown sugar for white sugar, giving the  bread a little more depth. I also added about 1/4 tsp ground cloves. It came out perfect, with just the right amount of spice. I will definitely use this recipe again!

I halfed the rec and baked on 325F. I decreased sugar, used 4 bananas and it came out nice and moist. Next timei will use more sugar though because i do like my bread sweeter.

Wonderfully rich and moist, with a tiny tang of sour cream.  I didn't do the "outer coating" of sugar and cinnamon, and I don't think I would want to.  It's just sweet enough without it.  Perfect!

Wow!  This is the best banana bread recipe I've ever found.  My family LOVES it.  I have tweaked it a little by replacing some of the sugar with Splenda and using nonfat or light sour cream, and it still tastes amazing!

Great recipe!  I halved the recipe, but only had one loaf pan, so I made that and a 8x8 "loaf".  Both were delicious! I brought it to work and it was gone in less then 10 minutes (with 4 people eating it!) I'll be making this one again for sure!

Really good!  I'd never made Banana bread before, but I've tasted Banana bread... This one is good.  I almost gave it 4 stars because of the cooking time... I may have been my stove tho.  It took me almost 1 1/2 hours and the outside cooked more than the inside.  Still great tho.  I will use less in the pan and see if that helps any.  I followed the directions to a "T".  I'll try chocolate chips next time.  Thanks for sharing!

This was good but a little bland for my taste.  I did like the cinnamon mixture on the outside.  I made half the recipe (but you need to be careful since the sugar measurements in the instructions don't change with the ingredient changes).

This was very good bread.  I only gave it 4 stars because my husband wasn't so keen on it.  He said the Betty Crocker recipe was better.  Thankfully, I'm the one who does the baking, so this will be the recipe I use.  Can't wait to use it for muffins.  I halfed the recipe and it made one very large, dense loaf.

I love the sour cream, makes it very moist.  I did as another user did and substituted 1/4 cup apple sauce for the butter, I also added chunks of dark chocolate.  The sugar that lines the pan is a must.  Thanks for the great recipe.

The crust makes this banana bread, but to be honest I will use the cinnamon and sugar crust with a different banana bread recipe.

I'm always looking for a good recipe for those ripe bananas and I found one here. Probably the best banana bread I've made to date. I put bourbon cream cheese icing on it and took it to a cook out. Needless to say it didn't last long.

This bread is good, a little lighter than how I like my banana bread to be though. I was hoping that after using all that sour cream, I would be able to taste it, but not even a hint. :o( This is definately not a recipe that I would throw out, but I do prefer the EBNB (Extreme Banana Nut Bread) recipe off of this site better.

Excellent recipe! I made this for some friends who came over after dinner, and everyone raved. 
I skipped dusting the pans and just greased them instead because my husband doesn't like much cinnamon. I only used a dash of cinnamon in the batter itself too--still incredibly flavorful and full of banana goodness. I'm sure it's great with the cinnamon too, but it was excellent without as well. I cut back on the sugar as well, only using one part brown sugar and one white. 
When I halved the recipe, I used one whole egg and one egg white--came out perfect. 
This is my new favorite!!! Thanks for sharing!

Yummy- I was expecting more bite from the sour cream though.  Dusting the pan with cinnasugar (we always have this mixture on hand)is the most awesome idea!  I also sprinkled raw sugar generously on the top prior to baking- gives it a sweet, crunchiness.

Delicious!! This bread was so moist! It made the whole house smell great. Instead of putting nuts in the batter, I added a chopped walnuts and a little brown sugar on top of the batter right before baking it. Gave the bread a nice touch. Thanks for the recipe!

This was REALLY good!  I made this in 6 mini loaf pans, and had just a bit of left over batter.  As others suggested, I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup.  I used 4 large very ripe bananas (that's all I had).  I also replaced 1-1/2 cups of the flour with 1/2 cup of soy flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  I sprinkled some cinnamon sugar on top of each loaf for a nice topping.  Give the recipe a try, you won't regret it

The other reviewers are correct-this recipe is amazing.  I have made it twice now, the first time I followed the recipe exactly with amazing results (it makes a ton, two huge bread loafs and one 8 inch cake round).  The second time I halfed the recipe.  It wasn't as light and airy, more dense and bread like, but still tasted great!

This bread is so great. I made it in a 9" cake pan. It was moist, delicious and sooo yummy. I dressed it up with cream cheese icing. Will definitely use the recipe again.

I don't know if it is the best ever, but it is tasty. I omitted the nuts, used 1c of brown sugar and 1 1/2c white, 1c low-fat sour cream 1/2c yogurt and 1/4c black coffee (approximates) and moist...oh boy it took FOREVER to bake, at least another 20 minutes if not longer. It really puffed up (don't bake too close together)and then flattened a bit, so no nice dome on top, but really yummy still, more like a cake.

Awesome recipe! I tweaked it a bit -instead of 3C sugar, I used 1/2 splenda-sugar (1 1/2C each splenda & sugar). Instead of 3/4 butter, used Smart Balance. Added a little flour to the cinnamon/sugar mix and topped the bread. I used mini loaf pans and it's been a hit!

AWESOME! I used the fat free sour cream and i didnt have as many bananas as it called for and it turned out great.  I love that it calls for the cinnimon sugar covered pan...it adds kind of a sweet chewy crust to it...also i only put in 1 and 3/4 cup sugar.

An exceptional bread!  Extremely moist!  I used non-fat sour cream and only had 5 instead of 6 bananas, and it came out great.  Be aware that this recipe makes A LOT of batter.  I barely had enough room in my mixer for all the ingrediants.  I used two standard bread pans and then six mini loaf pans and managed to use up all the batter.  Will definately make it again.

This is the best banana bread recipe. Extremely moist. I modified it to add raisins. 

Here's what I did: Put 1/2 to 3/4 cup of raisins in a small sauce pan with 1/4 cup of water and boil it until almost all of the water cooks off of the fruit. Turn off the heat and pour Amaretto (you can probably also use brandy) into the pan and light it with a long match to flambe it. Light it and swirl the pan a little to make sure all of the alcohol has burned off. Drain it and add it to the batter. 

It needs more baking time than what the recipe calls for - or maybe my oven needs to be recalibrated.

This was fabulous!  It was so moist. It makes a lot, too!  I used organic white milled sugar and it was fantastic.  I took a loaf to a friend who said baking with that type of sugar didn't work for her.  She loved it!!!   
Definitely a keeper and great for gifts because it will make so many.  TY!

This is THE best banana bread recipe- hands down.  The only revision I make is to add about an additional 1/4 cup of sour cream.  I also add milk chocolate chips to one loaf for me.  :)  I will never make another banana bread!

I always seem to buy too many bananas. Since I have overripe bananas so often, I'm always trying new banana bread recipes. This is one of the best I've tried. I think I'll use this as my standard from now on. Just great!

I had to modify this recipe because I was out of sour cream, so I substituted vanilla yogurt. While I was on a role, I played around a little more. I replaced the walnuts with roasted peanuts, relaced the sugar for splenda brown sugar, and added a 1/2 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. The bread was heavy and dense, but very tasty!

This recipe makes for some  good banana bread. Warning: It will not last long. The first time I tried it I made a half batch which is good for experimenting with. I did not add as much sugar and a couple extra bananas.  Very moist and delicious.  I don't use the cinnamin sugar either.

This recipe makes alot of batter! I maxed out my stand mixer bowl before adding dry ingredients, had to switch to a larger bowl. The banana bread was very good, moist but not soggy and the cinnamon was just the right touch!  My husband took some to work and everyone liked it. I just took my last loaf out of the freezer and it does freeze well.  I have six bananas ripening right now so I can make another batch to take to book club in a couple weeks.  I have always used my grandmas recipe but this is so much better!

WOW...i butchered this recipe - and it still turned out EXCELLENT!  i only had about 3/4 of a 16 ounce container of sour cream so i topped off the container with some vegetable oil and skim milk.  i only had 3 bananas so i doubled the vanilla. i forgot to coat one of the pans with the sugar cinnamon mixture so i spread it on the top of the batter.  i mistakenly set the temperature too high in the first 10 minutes but turned it down.  i also don't remember how long i baked it.  guess what?!  it really didn't matter - all of these things worked!  my altered recipe yielded 1 large bundt and about half a large loaf.  the taste and texture is really very good - the little cinnamon crust is a something i'll use over and over again in other recipes too.  of course i will try to make the recipe as printed the next time and will post another review but thank you so much for sharing this winner!

This was an excellent banana bread!! It was very moist and had a great flavor.  I made it into muffins instead of loaves, cooked them for about 20 minutes, and they turned out great! I will be making this recipe again.

I've made this bread several times, always to rave reviews.  Even people who don't usually like banana bread are happy with this one.  Tried it with plain yogurt instead of sour cream and it wasn't as good.  Tried it with ripe, but not very ripe bananas and it was not as good. Omitted the cinnamon dusting and it wasn't as good. Just as written, this one is a 5!  Thanks!

Loved the idea but way to greasy.  It didn't rise like a typical sweet bread.  Cream cheese works better than sour cream.

This was good banana bread but i don't find anything amazing about it.  and the hour bake time is too short.  i baked mine at least 15 minutes longer, and the middle was still a little too moist.  i might up the temp to 350 next time.  thanks for the post though!

Wow, this was soooo good!  The best banana bread I've ever tasted.  Definately a keeper.  I love that it makes 4 loaves because theres enough for my family, and a couple to give away aswell.  I forgot to put the cinnamon in but it still tasted wonderful.

Sure, it tasted good. But not that much better than the Better Homes and Gardens recipe that I've been using for years. And with all that butter and sour cream, it is certainly fattier than many other recipes. I wasn't as knocked out as a lot of reviewers here, sorry.

Awesome.  I am 6 months pregnant and woke up at 5:45 this morning starving and not able to fall back to sleep.  I got up and had everything on hand (except walnuts) to make this recipe.  I just ate a hot piece with butter....yum!  Amazing!

I've made the recipe 3 times and each time everyone raves!!  The sour cream makes them so moist and adds a great tangy to contrast the sweetness of the bananas.  I usually half the recipe and it comes out perfect.  I skip the sugar/cinnamon pan dusting and sub half wheat flour and half brown sugar.  Easy recipe with fabulous results.  Thanks!!

Absolutely delicious.  My 3 year old ate two full slices when it was cooled.  Note: The bananas called for are probably meant to be small-medium.  We had 3 large bananas.  I had halved, the recipe but still had too much batter for one loaf pan.  It makes great muffins too if you have a little extra.

"The best!" It is perfect--so moist. Everyone raved about this banana bread. I have tried numerous recipes for banana bread and am always disappointed--not this time!

This is the best banana bread I've ever had.  My mom makes great banana bread - and I always thought the key was the brown bananas.  The sour cream makes it even more moist and delicious.

I love this recipe and constantly have people requesting I make this.It is so moist. I usually add an extra banana to the recipe. I also add chocolate chips to half of the batter. The kids love this recipe and it is also a great one to let them help with. There is so much they can do.

Wonderful>  I especially liked the sugar & cinnamon mixture inside the pan before you put the batter in.  This was a huge hit.  It took longer to bake though.  I used pecans instead of walnuts.

This was a very good banana bread...very moist!  I may cut back a little on the sour cream the next time I make it, as the bread had a slight "sour" flavor. (And I used EXTREMELY ripe bananas!)Family really liked the cinnamon/sugar sprinkled all over!

I thought this bread was fantastic just like all the other positive reviews.  My sister asked me to make some pumpkin bread for her to take to work for her coworkers and she said that everyone loved it.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, I will make this again and again.

Very good.  Kinda sweet though, so the next time, I will reduce the sugar or skip the cinnamon and sugar sprinkle. I didn't have the bread loaf pan, so I used the rectangle pyrex pan and 1 hour was too long.  Will reduce to 50 minutes the next time. I also used oil instead of butter.  Over all, it tastes great and very moist. A keeper.

Fanatastic!  I've never made banana bread before and this turned out wonderful.  Since I only had 3 ripe bananas I halved the recipe, and I had to cook for 10 extra minutes.  Otherwise I made exactly as directed.  Will make again...very very soon. :-)

I am so excited!  I have found my banana bread recipe!  This was delicious!  I have tried 2 others on here which were very good, but this one is the winner.  I omitted the nuts for personal preference, and I think I forgot to add the cinnamon to the batter, but that just made the banana flavor more dominant.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This was very good.  Family loved it.  I also added chocolate chips to the mix.  The only problem was trying to make less than 4 loaves!  I tried to half it and may have altered it a little.  I also had to cook longer than an hour.  Love the sugar mixture.

I love this recipe. I didn't change a thing except to add Chocolate chips in place of the walnuts. I also made mini muffins instead of loafs. The texture is wonderful, more like a cake than a bread, Which I love. Definitley my new favorite banana bread recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!!

I made 2 9x5 pans.I did not use sour cream, but used applesauce. I also did not "sugar" the pans. I did put a mixture of brown sugar and cinnamon on the tops before baking,though. Both loaves were gone in about 2 hours!!

Really, really delicious.  I made just one loaf, and at first I was disappointed at how little it rose in the oven - then I tasted it and all my reservations disappeared!  Very moist, dense and all eaten the same day.  I see why the original recipe is for 4 loaves now!

This is a delicious recipe!  The previous ones I have tried (not from this site) have all been typically dense and dry.  This recipe is SO moist and perfect in density.  I halved the recipe to make two regular sized loaves (I also only had three bananas) and baked at regular temp for regular time.  Turned out perfect.  The only thing was I couldn't get the cinnamon-sugar to stick to the pans so I lightly greased and then sprinkled the cinnamon-sugar.  I think that was a problem later though as my loaves ended up too moist and sticky on the outside.  We also sprinkled extra cinnamon sugar on the top of the loaves before baking.  Yum!  Next time will probably NOT grease the pans, skip the cinnamon-sugar on the pan and just sprinkle on top and see if that helps the outside be a little drier.  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

This tasted wonderful. I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't need 4 loaves, I had to adjust the recipe for one loaf, and it also didn't need to cook as long in my oven. I will use this recipe from now on for Banana Bread

I like this better than the popular Banana Banana Bread on this site.  I made a 4x8 loaf and baked a little over an hour about 8-10 minutes minutes more (ovens vary).  A sure way to make sure your bread is done is to stick a toothpick in the middle and if comes out clean its done.  I will make again adding chocolate chips and reducing back a little bit of the sugar because this bread is a little on the sweet side.

This is the best banana bread recipe!  Tastes almost identical to my grandmas recipe.  This is the recipe for you if you like your banana bread moist and dense.

This is my family's FAVORITE banana bread recipe. Whenever bananas start getting too ripe everyone always looks to me to make them a loaf or two. Sometimes I add chocolate chips to satisfy the chocoholics.

I added 1 tsp of allspice to add more flavor. I also substituted whole wheat flour for the half of the flour and added 3/4 cup of water because whole wheat flour makes the batter so thick. The cinnamon/sugar pan coating sounds good in theory, but in reality the sugar carmelizes and makes the bread stick to the pan. I made one 9x5 loaf and 12 large muffins. My boyfriend said "they're good" and ate 2.

The best banana bread I have ever made and tasted(my picky husband LOVED it). It needed extra cooking time though(maybe 15-20 extra mins). I made three regular sized loaves. We ate one and froze the other two. Thanks Esther :)

Love the sugar dusting on the outside.  I use a bit of pecans instead of walnuts since we don't care for walnuts. If you want banana bread, this is the recipe to use.

Thank you, Esther!  I love banana bread and this is the best.  Made it Christmas Eve for brunch and found it to be very moist.  The outside sugar is an extra nice touch. I will make this many more times.

Outstanding!!!  This is the first time I've made banana bread, and it turned out great!  It's the best banana bread I've ever had.  It's perfectlly moist, and I really love the idea of coating the pan with cinnamon sugar.  The only thing I changed was I used 3-9X5 pans, and cooked it for about 1 hour, and 20 minutes.  It made my place smell so yummy for the whole day.

This is really fantastic stuff...definitely a new family classic. It isn't overly sweet (although I didn't dust the pan with cinnamon sugar), which is a big plus, and it's moist but still holds together quite well. I also baked a 1/2 recipe in a bundt pan for 1 hour and 20 minutes...it was perfect. Great for snacking or warmed up with a dab of vanilla ice cream.

Wow.  The sour cream makes the bread.  It provides a uniquely wonderful slightly sour flavor to a sweet banana bread.  I think it's a great combination.

Not bad, not much better than my usual recipe. Made these changes, I used 1 cup of butter, 2.5 cups sugar, and 3.5 cups of flour. Less flour gives it a more delicate crumb, i think. Dont use less than 2.5 cups of sugar, it is necessary to balance the tang of the sour cream.

My family and I liked this bread. Be sure to use a huge bowl as this makes a very large amount of batter. It is very very moist almost to moist. Will probably make this once in awhile, but will stick with my other bannana bread and muffin recipes that I make all the time.

Excellent. I reduced the sugar to 2 c.,  and substituted 1 c. with brown sugar, and kept it in the oven for 1 hr. I'm a college student, and with only one round around the dorm, it was practically gone. I used a tube pan and made a couple muffins. The muffins turned out delicious, and the cake in the pan looked beautiful. I'll definitely make this again. =)

This was a wonderfully moist bread!  My husband couldn't wait to eat it, and it disappeared quickly!  I added some lemon juice to keep the bananas from turning brown, and to reduce some of the sweetness from the bananas.  I reduced the sugar, as another person put in their review and took the remaining sugar and cinnamon mixture and sprinkled it on top.  All in all a great recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

Oh my, yum!  The moistest cake I've ever had.  You can't really taste the sour cream, so I may want to try again with more, but it is excellent as is too.

This was so good! I made 2 8x5 loaves and 1 9x5 loaf. It really makes a lot! It filled my 12 cup mixing bowl to the brim so I had to add things slowly. Make sure you use a REALLY large bowl! This was so moist,we loved it! Thanks Esther for sharing this!

I also cut sugar amount in half as I had very ripe bananas. I have a dark colored 6 mini loaf pan which required about 65 minutes of baking. The loaves came out a little darker than desired-I think it comes from the loaf pan color. Otherwise, it's a good breakfast bread.

This bread is to die for! It makes a large batch and so I always make about six or seven mini loaves and either give them away or freeze them. Everyone raves when they taste this bread. A loaf disappears in minutes in our house!

My daughters and I made this bread when we were stranded home during a snow storm. It turned out delicious.  I was able to freeze a couple of loaves for future use and took one to a "girlfriends day out" and they all just raved about how moist and delicious it was.  I will definately let my bananas get over ripe again for this recipe! :)

This is the best recipe I have found. This gave me all that I was looking for in a banana bread. It has plenty of banana, very moist and makes the house smell soooooooooo good. I will not part with this one. I am waiting on my bananas to ripen so I can make another batch. I give this recipe an A+++++++++++++++++.

This is a fantastically easy and delicious recipe!!!! I cannot believe how great it came out - I am a terrible cook and baker, but this was so easy. And the taste! And the moisture!!!

I even used non-fat sour cream instead of full fat and it still tastes great! 

So - thank you for this recipe!

I made this for Thanksgiving Breakfast and found out I hadn't made enough.  Everyone loved it so much they complained when we ran out.  Next time I will double the recipe.  I plan on using it for Christmas gifts for neighbors.  I have a daycare and the kids enjoyed it without the nuts (of course) Thank you for a wonderful recipe.
