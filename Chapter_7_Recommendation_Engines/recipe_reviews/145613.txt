I love anything with pineapple in it. This recipe is yummy. I did make a change by using fat free ingredients and still loved it without guilt.

I made this over new years. Adding pecans to the topping was the only change I made.   I decided last minute to attend a party and didn't have time to make a traditional cheesecake. I made 3. 2 for the party and one for home. Didn't even try it just whipped it up and left. I had to fight for a piece at the party after our was taken out of the fridge lol and both were gone in a half hour. I loved it as well. Just make sure to refrigerate or it turns out more like creme pie. Also once the family dug in I didn't get much of the one I made for home either lol.
