i made this as a last minute dinner for my mother in law and nephews. its was delicious and very simple to make. the only thing i did differently is i used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of onion and i omitted the water. the gravy that was created was of a good consistency and the pork was juicy. i will make it again.

This was fabulous.  Couldn't find condensed onion soup and used celery.  Will be making this many times.  Since I made pork chops for the two of us, I had a lot of sauce/gravy left.  Next time I think I will add some peeled and quartered potatoes.  Scrumptious!

Sauce was delicious. It was very watery for me, maybe because I used bone-in chops. Next time I will leave out the water. The chops just fell apart and couldn't stop eating them. Thanks for the recipe!

First time I followed recipe without cream of onion - can't find it anywhere - only did 4 chops so used just 1 can of cream of mushroom.  Everybody liked it ok, but said the ranch tasted "weird". The Second time, I left out the ranch and added minced garlic on top of the onions and a "squirt" of Dijon mustard to the soup - everybody loved it. So, 4 stars as written.

Very good recipe for a busy day. Slicing onions was the hardest part! I added about 2 cups of sliced mushrooms and used all cream of mushroom soup and knorr leek soup. Omitted the water as the onions and mushrooms and chops would release plenty of juice. Hubs loved it and there are plenty of leftovers for another easy meal.

Loved it!  I cooked it for family and the absolutely loved it.  I passed on the recipe to my brother, who is learning to cook, and it turned out great for him.  I love how easy it is to throw it in the crockpot and come back to a meal.  I couldn't find cream of onion soup, so I used an extra can of cream of mushroom.  I used bone in porkchops and it turned out great.  I added seasoning salt, garlic powder, and onion powder because I thought it was going to be bland.

I made this for the second time & the flavoring, ease of recipe is super. This last time I used boneless pork chops. I changed up a little after reading other reviews. I put can of "French onion" soup in bottom of slow cooker, added pork, a little garlic salt on meat. Sprinkled maybe 1/2 package of dried onion soup & then can of Mushroom soup. Only added small amount of water (1/4 cup) while rinsing soup cans. Did add some corn starch @ end to thicken. Very tasty!

Instead of pork chops I used a 2 1/2 pound pork roast.  I could not find cream of onion soup so I used a can of cream of celery instead of the cream of onion soup.  I made this with white rice and the sauce was a good gravy to use for it.  Has a great taste.

I will try this. Sounds a bit richer/more depth than other similar recipes. Glad we cleared up that 'Fluid Ounces' on the water! Heehee! :]

Made these delicious and easy pork chops in my crock pot as the recipe instructed except that I did brown the pork chops first. Could not find any cream of onion soup so just used two cream of mushrooms soups plus the dried onion soup mix. Served it over brown rice with steamed broccoli and dinner rolls and my family loved it all. Thanks so much for this great and easy recipe!                                  Colorado Karen

Unless you're a fan of onion I would suggest replacing the cream of onion soup. I also suggest reducing the liquid as it's too much. Overall this is a basic recipe a beginner can make and be proud of.

This was so good.  I didn't have cream of onion so I had to use 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup.  the 1st night I served it with mashed potatoes.   The left overs made excellent open faced sandwiches.

I just made this today accept I didn't add any onion soup or ranch mix. Instead I added 2 cans of cream of mushroom condensed soup and sprinkled Weber's roasted garlic and herbs and it was very tasty. I only give it 4 stars because it was to watery for me I prefer a thicker gravy.

I thought this was great.   I used very thick center cut pork chops - only two as I basically cut the recipe in half as it was just for my wife and I.   I still make the same amount of sauce though.

I served this over egg noodles.. 

(We had left overs, lotta sauce and noodles, one pork chop,.   Added a large spoonful of sour cream and warmed in the microwave - wow, pork stroganoff)

This is on my favorite list. I couldn't find cream of celery, so I used condensed cream of mushroom and added sliced portabella mushrooms. I put it on low for 5 hours and it was delicious. My two year old and 14 month old loved it.

Have always uses one can cream of mushroom or chicken and one packet dry on ion slip mix.  Add a can of liquid of choice , brown the meat, then add all of this, cover and simmer.  Always excellent and terrific gravy.  Works for pork, beef and chicken....just change out the soup . A little vermouth or dry wine doesn’t hurt. Neither does sliced mushrooms. Been doing this since the 60s.

Much too salty ... Omit the ranch dressing.
Also, brown the chops prior to throwing raw chops into a slow cooker.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was awesome!  I followed the recipe completely and wouldn’t change a thing.  I will certainly fix it again!  I am considering using a different protein just to see it goes.  LOVE IT!

I was making this last minute and of course, was out of a few items. (1) I didn't have any onion so I used onion powder, (2) I didn't have cream of onion soup so I used cream of celery instead and (3) I didn't have dry onion soup mix so I used Italian seasoning mix instead. Having made those changes, I should also note that my husband does most of the cooking, so to my shock and amazement, he LOVED this and said I should definitely make this again soon. YES!! It is a keeper!!!

I made this and it was quite delicious.  The pork chops were so tender they almost fell apart. The soup made an excellent gravy which I served over mashed potatoes.  Will make it again.

This recipe was awesome and my family loved it!! I did it a little differently marinating the pork chops over night with the dry ranch dip. Also I used 2 cans of mushroom soup and a little bit of milk instead of water. Highly recommend this!!

I made this for my boyfriend tonight. I reduced the recipe to feed 2. I used 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, just a quick shake of the ranch packet & onion soup mix. Also only about 1/2 cup of water. Towards the end I microwaved some carrots then added to them to the crock pot for the last half hour of cooking. I made boiled cauliflower & potatoes for a side dish. Delicious!

This really is as good as everyone else says! Super simple and easy to "jujj" up as you need/like to. I used with four pretty large chops, and doubled the ranch packets (2 oz total), added way more onions, some lemon and apple slices and one less can of cream of chicken. Let it on low with frozen chops for several hours and they turned out great!

I would make it again on my cooking night lol. Too cold to BBQ and I don't like to fry, so was an easy way for me to make chops. Tested frequently towards the end so as not to overcook as we like our chops tender. Wished I had put more of the sauce on my plate.

I went with cream of celery soup. Will use cream of chicken next time, as my "picky" one noticed the tiny celery pieces! I added new potatoes cut once for the gravy base. I will make it again.

Not a fan of pork, but my family is. I made these exact to the recipe and they’re definitely my favorite pork chops ever. My family loved them and I could actually tolerate them.

I did not like the sauce. It tasted heavily of onion and I like onion. The ranch dressing mix added an odd flavor too.

This is a simple and delicious recipe.  I used a can of cream of celery soup and cream of chicken with herbs.  Instead of water I used chicken broth.  Husband loved it even the next day heating up the leftovers.  Recently I used the same ingredients to make the gravy sauce and put it over hamburger steak with onions and green peppers.  Love it!

The meat turned out a little dry and the flavor was a bit sharp, very creamy sauce though. Wouldn't make again.

I made this for dinner last night and it is definitely a keeper. I couldn't find cream of onion soup so I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom instead. Other than that I followed the recipe and it turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe!!!  The gravy was perfect for mashed potatoes. My husband loved it too!!!

Used one can cream of celery and one can cream of onion, and added red potatoes (peeled and sliced into 1/4  inch rounds) on the very top. Potatoes cooked nicely in the gravy and gravy was a good consistency. Meat was tender & flavorful. I would sub a different cream soup instead of onion to cut back a little on the onion flavor. Will also sauté the onions a bit next time to add color. Quick and easy, and thumbs up from the family!

I made these tonight for dinner. I had 6 bone-in center cut pork chops. I only had one can of cream of celery soup to which I added 5 oz. of water & 2 T of corn starch (most reviews said the sauce was watery.) I added the pkg. of dry onion soup mix to that mixture. I DID brown up the pork chops with a little salt & pepper before placing in the slow cooker. Sliced one onion and layered it on the bottom and the 3 pork chops, poured some sauce on top and then another layer of onions & chops. Cooked on high for 2 hours and turned it to low. They came out delicious and looked very appetizing. Did not add the dry ranch dressing as some ppl said they didn't like the taste. I would make it the same way again! Next time will will make it with chicken. Thanks All-Recipes!

I 'be been making a version of this for years. It's called Georgian Pork Chops. I substitute about a half cup of peanut butter for the cream of onion soup by first heating the mushroom soup and gradually stirring in the PB until it is well blended. Substitute white wine for the water, and leave out the ranch dressing mix. Delicious! And no one can guess that there's peanut butter in it!
NOTE: Be careful of guest's possible peanut allergies

This was very good. Simple ingredients of onions, cream of mushroom and cream of onion soups set up a smooth creamy sauce; powdered ranch dressing and beef flavored onion soup mix added a flavorful sweet zing. My only variation from the recipe was I browned the chops; 2 minutes each side. 4 hours in crock pot with a meat temp around 162—still fork tender pork!!

This was a great meal to come home to after a soccer game.  I prepared the slow cooker in the morning and put it in the refrigerator.  After school, my son turned it on.  When we came home around 7:30 that evening, I served it with rice and green beans .  I will make it again!

Glad I read the reviews before I made it. I didn’t add the water and it was still too much liquid so will find a way to thicken it when I make it again. It was a big hit and on my favorites list.

The soups stayed clumpy, the onion soup mix was overpowering, and the pork chops looked nothing like the photo. They were blanched. I suggest if you want to try this recipe, use very little of the onion soup mix and blend the soups, water, and mixes before pouring over chops.

Great recipe!  I agree with the other reviewers-eliminate the water for a nice gravy. I added a little more spice but followed rest of recipe as-is. Everyone loved it!  So easy. Thanks!

Very very oniony. Used only one can of cream of cream of mushroom and NO cream of onion. Meat was also very dry but that is also just the nature of the meat. If I was to make again, I would cut out the dry onion soup mix and add cream of chicken. I would also brine my pork chops prior to the crockpot.

Very yummy and tender. I used cream of celery instead of onion because I'm not a fan of a too oniony taste. I also used a spicy ranch mix and it gave the chops an extra kick. Will definitely make again.

Read some other helpful reviews and used 2 cans of mushroom soup instead of onion soup. Added less water to keep the sauce thicker. Easy to make and delicious!! Served it with penne pasta and green beans.

Really disappointed - all of the ingredients sounded great together but yielded something of a 'cafeteria meal' as per my husband's review.  Had to sub the cream of onion soup because supermarket didn't have it - but I doubt that was the culprit.  Not a fan.

Extremely tasty! Followed reviews by not adding water and leaving out the ranch dressing mix. Also, instead of cream of onion I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup with the 1 can of cream of mushroom. Served with mashed potatoes. Perfect gravy, tender chops.

We have prepared this recipe twice for dinner, last night we prepared for visiting family.  It is easy, the whole house smells great while cooking, and it is delicious.  We normally begin in the morning so we put on high for 2 hours then change to low for 6 hours.  Just printed the recipe for our visiting family who enjoyed this so much that they want to prepare when they return home.  This one is a "keeper".

Easy, tasty.  My husband and I only make 4 chops at a time, so I used one can of soup and cut the remaining ingredients in half.  I usually sautee or bake my chops and, at times, they come out tough or dry.  These were very tender and moist.

Killer recipe, easy to prepare enjoyable to eat. What I would do differently next time is one member mentioned to use cornstarch in the liquid, brilliant idea. I made smashed taters and the chop gravy was an excellent topper. Another addition is mushrooms, adding some shrooms would have brought this little gem to a new level. 

On an other note, I should have weighed myself after joining this site and then at the beginning of the next year see how much weight I gained.

To be blunt, we didn't like this.  I followed other reviewers and used two can of mushroom soup and no added water.  I added a can of mushrooms. But with two cans of soup and the ranch dressing mix and the onion soup mix, it was salty, and I like salt.  I cooked it on low for 3 hours, on high for one hour, and on low for another hour.  But the meat was not falling apart like usual and the onions were a little crunchy.  After it sat for a  day, it mellowed out some.  The sauce minus the ranch mix is very similar to what I put on a chuck roast when I make a pot roast.  It works well there but did not here.   I will not make this again..

Definitely very easy, but flavor was just meh.  Didn't like the fact that the pork chops fell apart and they also didn't look very appealing when finished.  Certainly not like the picture on the page.

Yummy yum yum. Used golden mushroom soup and cream of celery soup as that is what I had. Smell while cooking was amazing. Taste when done was amazing. Served over mashed taters, a real winner with hubby.

Took a little longer to cook. Didn’t use ranch. Used 2 mushroom soup cans because I couldn’t find cream of chicken. Used bone broth instead of water.

Turned out great was a big hit. Doubled recipe for 8 people, no leftovers. I got the Campbell’s Cream of Onion soup from Amazon. Had to buy a case of 12. But, will be adding it to other recipes like roast beef.

The sauce was very watery. I was willing to look past the consistency of the sauce, but I also did not enjoy the flavor of the sauce. Maybe with alterations to the recipe, I would enjoy. However, as written, I did not like this recipe. One positive was the meat was very tender and falling apart.

I used the pork chops I had on hand that were bone in and some boneless.  After cutting the onion as directed and layering between the chops, I took all the other ingredients, mixed them thoroughly, then poured the mixture over the chops and onions.  The gravy is so good I'm considering trying the recipe with tenderized beef.

Going to try to do low and slow cooking next time. A little overdone doing high cooking times. Flavor was amazing! Will add mushrooms next time too. Kids loved it too which is a winner...just dry meat.

My meat thermometer went off at 145 degrees after 1 hour; however, it wasn't the first time that happened. I cooked the porkchops for 2.5 hours and the sauce was delicious over rice. I couldn't find cream of onion soup or 10.75 ounce cans, so i used a french onion soup and 10.5 ounce cans.  Although the chops were tender (not fork tender), I wonder how would they be at 145 degrees?

The taste was good, the pork was tender but it was way too salty. I added more water to get rid of some of the salt. I tend to favor salt and it normally doesn’t bother me but even for me this was too much.

Very god!!!! I used pork steaks instead of regular pork chops. I like some fat on my meat. Due to not finding condensed onion soup, I used cream of celery with a can of cream mushroom soup. I like some spice so I used a tablespoon of chili sauce. The rest of the recipe I followed exactly. Oh I forgot only used 4 oz of water them used some cornstarch to make gravy a little thicker.

We really enjoyed this dish. We modified it a little by adding some sliced mushrooms in the middle of the two layers and sliced new potatoes on the top layer. 
Really nice flavor and the meat almost fell off the bone.

This is so easy and so good!  I add red potatoes near the end. Time depending on if I’m cooking it on low or high. I add half the fluid for thicker sauce. I don’t and cream of onion or onion soup mix. It would work well with most cream soups.  I’ve also made it on the stovetop.  This is a great meal train meal.

Good and tender pork chops.  Needs a little more flavor for my taste and it had a little too much liquid.  But overall it was a decent dish.

Not that good. I have to say that I could not find cream of onion so I used cream of celery. I don’t think that’s what made them not taste good. I would recommend seasoning the meat with the salt and pepper. Maybe that will help. The meat was dry tasting, almost like eating dry tuna out of a can.

This was absolutely delicious. This is a perfect dish to make for anyone who doesn’t want to slave in the kitchen but wants a great meal to make. Since I need the meal to be completed sooner, I threw everything in my Ninja Foodi and it was superb.

Absolutely delish!!! 
I did not add the onion soup mix or ranch dressing mix as i was concerned about sodium. But, even without those 2 ingredients it was delish. I served it over egg noodles

So I really wanted to try this recipe but didn't have the right soups on hand and wasn't going to the store but did have a can of Cream of Bacon soup.
WOW !!!!! it turned out Amazing with just the Cream of Bacon soup (and of course the other remaining ingredients)!
I did reduce the # of pork chops to 2 because I cook for one, and I did cut them in half lengthwise tho to give me 2 servings of thinner chops.
I will be making this again and again!

I did it with bone in pork chops the first time and served it with rice.  The 2nd time I used chicken and served it with Pappardelle noodles.  I also added a bit of garlic.  Excellent both ways!!!

Enjoyed but I didn't like the way the onions turned out. Next time will brown onions before adding plus omit cream of onion substitute cream of mushroom maybe add mushrooms. I also like the idea of adding potatoes. So many ways to make it your own

I just wanted to cook two boneless loin chops. So, I just used an onion, one can of soup (mushroom) and one packet of soup powder (onion), one small can of mushroom pieces and halved the water.  I used my smaller crockpot. I cooked it for about five hours, half on high, half on low.  The sauce tasted excellent, maybe needed even less water.  but the meat was very disappointing. Maybe the cut was wrong, as usually I enjoy that cut, but these were like eating softish tasteless string.

This is a great recipe.  Like other reviewers I could not find cream of onion soup, so I replaced with cream of chicken soup. I also forgot to pick up the dry onion soup mix, so I searched Allrecipes for info to make my own.  I had all the necessary spices.  Happily it tasted just like the dry mix you buy.  This recipe may be a tad salty for some, so I did not add any additional salt.  I'm looking forward to the leftovers too.

I tried this once but the ranch dressing mix keep it a weird flavor. Then I tried it again without the ranch dressing with one can of cream of celery and one can of cream of mushroom. Everyone loved it and my family.

Followed the recipe to the letter. I had high hopes for this recipe; sadly, we were all disappointed.  Sorry, but this just awful!  my hubby even said next time, he would go hungry rather than eat this again.  I will say, the pork chops were extremely tender. Unfortunately, the ranch gave a strange tang to the sauce. What a waste of meat!

I made this with a couple of changes.  Couldn't find cream of onion soup so used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup. Since others said it was too watery, I only used 4 ounces of water.  We loved this recipe!  I made Uncle Ben's Wild Rice and we put the gravy on top of the rice too and it was delicious! I will definitely make again soon!  Also only used 8 pork chops since only 2 of us but had enough for left overs!

I saved this recipe although I havent' tried it yet.  For the people that said it was watery try thickening with some cornstarch mixed with cold water.  I love my gravy!  My husband drives a school bus and I need recipes that I can have timed to when he gets home, usually about 6-6:30 in the evening.  What caught my attention was the picture.  When I was growing up my mother had a recipe for liver and onions and it looked like this.  There was always gravy with it and she made yeast rolls to go with it.  I may try adapting this recipe to use with liver.  Wish I knew how to make her rolls.

I will make it again with some changes. Next time I will add a smaller amount of diced onion instead of sliced onion rings and maybe add mushrooms. The gravy turned out just right per the instructions.

The key to this recipe is to use bone in chops and cook on high 3 1/2 to 4 hours so they don't dry out. I omitted the onions and used 2 cans of cream of mushroom since I couldn't find cream of onion. I also sprinkled a little bit of Laurey's season salt on top. The last 20 minutes I added minute rice to soak up the sauce for an instant side dish. It was delicious!

Good,  doesn’t need the salt and pepper added. The seasonings from the ranch and onion soup mixes are plenty salty!  Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe as written. Turned out tasty.

This turned out great, but the gravy was too thin.  It seems that everything I make in my crockpot according to recipe is too thin.  However, this recipe is very good, but I will leave off the ranch dressing next time.

I made recipe as is and the gravy was a little thin so I removed the pork chops, added cornstarch to thicken and added the chops back. I wasn't too crazy about the flavor as the onion seemed to be overwhelming for my taste, but the meat was tender and my family absolutely loved it!  Served with a side of rice, with gravy of course and green beans and hot rolls.

Great flavor! It is a bit saltier than expected so next time I would omit the additional salt and probably use less of the ranch and onion soup packets. I also used two cans of cream of mushroom instead. I would make this again!

Simple, but delicious. The only thing I did different was that I used about 3/4 each of the ranch mix, and the onion soup mix.

I will definitely make again. I did omit the water as I wanted a thicker sauce. I added season salt and  garlic powder. I also used fresh mushrooms.

Excellent recipe. The chops were fall off the bone tender, but not dried out. I followed the recipe except I added no water, and used two cans of cream of mushroom soup vs. one each of cream of mushroom and cream of onion. It produced a perfect gravy that was not too thick and not too thin. We plan to serve the leftovers over noodles. Plan to try it with a pork roast next time.

Although this recipe called for pork chops, I used a beef roast & was thrilled with the results. I used cream of celery soup instead of onion as that was what I had on hand. I also used a Leek dry soup packet as again it was on hand. The results were delicious! It did seem like overkill on the liquid but I can't argue with the results. This one's a keeper.
