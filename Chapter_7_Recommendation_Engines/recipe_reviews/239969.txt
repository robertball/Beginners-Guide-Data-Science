Made these today and they are delicious! Only thing I changed was how I prepared them, I made these changes based on a few other reviews that had great tips! Here's how I made mine:
Used a food processor or blender to grind up the oatmeal and chocolate chips in to a powder. Pour this mixture in to a bowl, stir in the flax until well mixed. Then add in your pb (I used creamy)and vanilla. Heat the honey for about 10sec so that it is thinner, then add to the bowl. Stir until well combined. Put in to fridge for 10-30mins, use a 1/2 tbsp measuring spoon to dish out the dough (can be rounded scoops or exact, doesn't matter). This made me about 30, 1inch bites. Put in the freezer to enjoy later!

To help keep the mix from sticking to my hands, I refrigerate it for about 30 minutes before making into balls. This really helps! These are also very good with toasted coconut mixed in.

I have three athletic middle schoolers who eat like a hoarde of ravenous locusts.  I followed a reviewer's suggestion, doubled the batch, processed it in my food processor, and then spread it in an 8x8" silicone baking "pan" and refrigerated it, slicing it after an hour or so (because ain't nobody got time to roll a bunch of dough balls).  I immediately put the bars into snack bags (or else, they'd be picked to nothing in the pan by the aforementioned locusts) and back into the freezer until the locusts are allowed to transfer them directly from the freezer to their lunch bag.  They're delicious, they're easy, and thanks to Aldi ingredients, they're inexpensive.

I was super impressed with this recipe!! My husband's #1 hobby is body building... I am always in search of a good recipe that fits into his eating plan. These are perfect! I have made them several times with different nuts and fruits even pumpkin is good. Serve them COLD it makes all the difference!

I followed the recipe exactly and it made 11 medium size balls (not too big or too small). Use natural PB so the wet and dry stick together better.  You can also heat the wet (honey & PB) up before mixing (balls will be darker, but same taste).

Made these few weeks ago, keep in fridge for when I need-yes need;) easy, yummy & health conscious. I added some dark chocolate nut butter, as well peanut butter, added some cinnamon, & didn't have enough vanilla so augmented with almond. They were tiny bit sweet for me so I'll use less honey next time. I look forward to making these again, perhaps trying almond butter or using pb chips-lots of possibilities!

Easy to make and oh so good!!! I didn't have crunchy peanut butter and used creamy and it was great! My kids (me too) really enjoyed eating this energy balls.The key is the mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. They give it that extra chocolately crunch and it is a perfect compliment with the peanut butter. Can't wait to make these balls again!

Delicious!! Didn't change a thing. Question though - how many bites on average should the recipe make?

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this. I substitute flax seeds for walnuts but that's just because I never have flax seeds laying around the house. These are delicious and filling. They're actually pretty addicting too, haha.

I used a little less honey, and I only had organic creamy peanut butter. Added a bit of toasted coconut. Threw it all in the FOOD PROCESSOR, chopped it up finely and then pressed in a pan and put in freezer. Later cut out squares for the perfect snack - thanks for this recipe! My entire family loves these!!!

It's not often that I find something everyone in my house loves. I can't keep these around-I'm constantly making them! I do lessen the amount of honey and have never used the vanilla but they still taste wonderful. I also add M&M's once in a while because hey-I didn't see any rules about that,right? ;)

Followed this exactly, and the family devoured them! I think I will be doing many variations on this fast, simple & easy recipe. I do want to note I used natural peanut butter, which worked really well bonding with the oats.

Both my kids and my hubby practically inhaled these. I doubled the recipe, used quick oats, creamy peanut butter (what I had on hand), replaced the flax seed with sunflower seeds (again, what I had on hand) and scooped them up with my cookie scooper.  This little gadget made forming them into balls really easy.  I froze them and everyone loves them.  I'm making them again today and made need to quadruple the recipe so they'll last a little longer.  Yumm!!  Like eating raw cookie dough only safer and healthier, but you wouldn't know it was healthier by the flavor - just too delish.

I use natural peanut butter. I also add 1 Tbsp hemp hearts, and 1 Tbsp chai seeds and 1/3 cup coconut (and never tried it with vanilla). So good. It saves mid afternoon trips to the vending machine.

Made these one night as I thought they'd be a quick and easy breakfast the next morning. And they were. My 5 year old and I both really enjoyed these! Although having them right out of the freezer makes them hard to bite into at first, I left some out for a few minutes and they were much better right out of the freezer! My husband thought they were too sweet to eat a few at a time. But my son and I enjoyed them, reminds me of a Snickers bar!

It was OK, then we added stuff and it was delicious! We had to use sunflower butter because of a nut allergy, but it needed more, so we added about 1/4 teaspoon vanilla stevia and a teaspoon of cinnamon.  We also subbed ground chia seeds for flax. Then they were delicious!

My 6 year old loves these we have been making them quite a bit experimenting just a little. Tonight I added almonds, chia seeds and subsituted the honey with agave which I liked better because the honey is so potent! We will continue making these. I feel better about these than store bought granola bars for him

Easy to make, but way too sweet!  Maybe if I cut the honey to 1/4th the amount (I had used only 1/2 the amount)?  Maybe if I had used something less sweet than chocolate chips?  I'll make these again, but will need to change the recipe up a bit. I really like the idea of flax seed meal in these!

Really good!!  I made them as-is and family loved them.  Next times around I used 1/3c PB (not a super PB fan) and I've mixed in white chocolate, coconut, butterscotch chips, crushed-sliced almonds or craisins (NOT all at the same time).  Yummy too, and didn't change consistency.  I haven't had any trouble with being too dry. Another tip would be to add about 1TBS coconut oil. We keep them in the freezer.  Thank you!

This is a delicious, easy recipe. They go fast and fill you up well! Energy balls can easily be made without exact measurements,  so after trying this recipe once (or even without trying it once) you can add/subtract things, like adding cinnamon, sunflower seeds, chia seeds, coconut, etc. To make the chocolate chips more bite-sized, I ran them through a hand-cranking nut slicer machine thingy.

Wow! These are delicious! I used cinnamon sugar soy butter (nut allergy) and also added about 1/2 a cup of rice krispies. Next I will try it with a vegan "honey". Thank you for posting this!

I made once exactly as the recipe suggested and they were great! I made them a second time adding a scoop of vanilla protein powder and that was delicious too. A yummy way to get your energy and protein. Perfect for this busy Mom on the go!

I'm giving it 5 stars even though I changed it. I didn't have flax on hand but usually do, since I had started making it I decided to give it a go with chia instead. Oh wow! So yummy!  I also used natural pb. Will probably always have these on hand in the freezer now since I live with four men!

These energy bites are delicious! I did add some coconut, about a 1/2 cup. I also wanted to add that some people leave out the flax seed meal and they say thier recipe didn't turn out. The flax seed meal is like a flour, so if you leave it out, you should replace it with something else like Almond Meal, or something that is high protein in powder form. You could even throw some oatmeal in a blender and grind it to a flour, but that takes the enegy level out of the snack. It is still nutritious, but not necessarily energizing. I used Golden Flaxseed Meal and really couldn't tell that it had flax seed in it. Anyway, these are delicious!!

These were good & irresistible... However, to keep them on the healthy side I used 1/3c of whole organic fresh linseed and 1/3 cup of cacao nibs and grounded them in my nutribullet.   then used a 1/2 cup of the ground mixture, instead of a half cup of each.   I toasted some coconut flakes in a tad of coconut oil and mixed it all together.   yummy yummy!!!  grazie

Delicious and healthy! I used 1/4 cup chia seeds instead of the 1/2 cup ground flax seed and after shaping them into balls, I rolled them in quick-cooking oats for easier handling. The second time I made them I added half the honey and more peanut butter (they were rather sweet the first time).  Yummy!

Oh Gosh, these are so yummy!!! but I have a problem that hopefully someone can answer. How many is considered a serving and calories? I can't find any any info. But a definite 2 thumbs up. If you put it in the refrigerator after you make them up they are much easier to roll into balls

This was an awesome recipe! I added raisins. I will continue to make these: tweaking them according to ingredients on hand.

I did not make these for any certain health benefit, but just as a change of menu for me.  I have shed a least two inches in the past three weeks: I will not complain about that,

These were great! Only thing I changed - I was out of crunchy peanut butter used regular and added about 2 tablespoons of granola for texture. Going to make again with crunchy peanut butter.

These power bites are a family favorite. I make three batches a week, and guests ask for them whenever they come over! Sometimes I skip the vanilla and add a little extra peanut butter to make them a bit softer. Also, I use Quick Cook oats—the oats are smaller and easier to chew.

These are so simple and delicious! I have added protein powder to them to give them a bigger protein punch. I have also used different nut butters and they are all good. The best part is, I can make them in 20 minutes from start to finish. They are a staple in my house now! Thank you for this fabulous recipe!

These are delicious and addictive.   I’ve already made two batches.  My only suggestion is to dampen your hands while rolling these into balls, as the mixture is very sticky.

Hubby and I love these for a treat straight from the freezer. Quick and easy to whip up too.  The original recipe was a little too sweet for our taste so I cut back the honey to a 1/4 cup and they still hold together nicely.

Really great recipe. I used almond butter, as opposed to peanut, due to allergies and they were wonderful. The flax definitely leaves a bit of an aftertaste, next time I will reduce the amount and maybe add in chia seeds. Easy recipe to adapt to different tastes. I'm looking forward to playing around with it a little to see what other tasty combinations I can come up with.

I used Trader Joe's crunchy peanut butter and these didn't stay together at all.  They were way too sticky and were sticking to my hands so I couldn't even roll them.  When I added more oats, they wouldn't stay together in the balls.  I just stuck them in the freezer to see if they'll roll together later.

These were great! So easy and quick to make. I substituted chopped walnuts for the flax seed and used regular sized chocolate chips. I also used quick oats and creamy peanut butter since that's what I had.  Froze the balls for about an hour and they were great right out of the freezer. Thanks!

I loved these!!! Doubled the recipe but used a total of 1/2 cup raw honey and they were sweet enough.... Ok made them a second time with no honey, just used semi sweet dairy free chocolate chips and added raisins to sweeten them and for having almost no sugar (I used unsweetened natural pb)  they were still delicious!!!

My kids and our carpool buddy can't get enough of these.   Every day when I pick them up from school they ask if I brought them energy bites (since they can't take peanut butter to school.)  I just keep them in the freezer until I pack them into my lunchbox in the morning.  Delicious!

These are very good, I had a little bit of coconut so I added it and they taste great.  The first time I made them, I used my hands and it was messy, the second time I used a cookie scoop, it was much easier and less messy.

I made these and really enjoyed them.  I had a few leftover black walnut pieces and put those in also.  I will make them again, since they are a healthy alternative to other snacks.

I made this recipe following it exactly. I LOVED THEM!!! My husband and I went on vacation and I took these and some Oatmeal bars. When we were out in the  middle of no where, we just grabbed these and they satisfied us completely. Thank you and I will be making these all the time.

I used honey and fresh ground almond butter.  It is delicious!  I have used a small cookie scoop to make the balls, makes a nice size/mouth size individual piece.  Next time I make them, I might add some protein powder, ground Chia seeds and ground hemp.   Like others, the possibilities of what you can add to this basic recipe is endless.   Great recipe and thanks for sharing!!

I made a few changes to the recipe, I wanted something with a little more protein. I did not add the rolled oats and used french vanilla protein powder (the serving size on the container) and I added a little more peanut butter to make them stick better. My batch made 22 servings (1 ball) and each has ~ 46 calories, 4 grams of protein, and 3.6 carbs each.

These are always delish! I modified and removed chia seeds, swapped to dark choc chips and then rolled in unsweetened coconut flakes. Tastes like an almond joy. Accidentally melted the chocolate when I warmed up the PB and honey, but was not disappointed.

I found these far, far too sweet and tasted primarily like honey. I ended up doubling the original recipe but left out the honey and vanilla in the doubled portion then dipped the balls in a little course sea salt which made all the difference.

I have been making these as per the exact recipe for a while but recently had to substitute a few ingredients and I wanted to share how it turned out; spoiler alert, just as good as easier to form. To be clear the advertised recipe is great too.

I used quick 1 minute oats in place of rolled oats and since I only had 1/6 cup honey, I substituted the remainder with 1/6 cup maple syrup and a tbsp of light brown sugar. I took advice from others and lightly heated the liquids and peanut butter before mixing with the solids and refrigerated for 30 minutes prior to forming the protein balls. I found they didn’t stick to my hands or the spoon as much and it made them easier to form. Also when the protein balls are frozen, the texture is much easier to bite into immediately without having to wait for them to defrost.

This recipe was delicious. The only thing I'll change next time is the shape of the 'bites'. Because they're frozen, it's hard to get your teeth into it, especially in the middle. Next time I'll freeze the mixture in a granola bar shape instead.

Delicious! My kids don't care for oats so I ground up a cup of rolled oats in my Vitamix and made them into a powder and followed the remainder of the recipe as it's written. With a house full of middle school, athletic boys a double batch was devoured in 2 days!

After looking through the reviews and my pantry, I made it with the following changes:
- sunflower seeds instead of flax seed
- added 1 T chia seeds
- used almond extract instead of vanilla extract
- scanted on the honey (1/4 cup)

Put a layer of shredded coconut into a small casserole dish lined with parchment paper, then pressed the mixture in.  Froze, cut into bars.

5 star after changes made. I used almond butter, agave, flax meal instead due to dietary restrictions. Very good.
Added raisins and dried cranberries to second batch. They would not stay together. I will not do that again.
Otherwise tasty.  Goggling them as i write.

Very good, easy to make, and a great snack. This recipe is on the back of the organic ground flax meal sold at Trader Joe's though so not an original recipe. Poster shouldn't claim it as their own.

These are so so good, and very easy ! I didn't have chocolate chips so I used the white chocolate ones I had and dried cranberries as well ! And I used a cookie dough scooper so there was no mess and I didn't have to roll the balls by hand. Thanks for the great recipe !

This was a really great recipe loves it so much. Would not add as much flax seed though I added about half of what it called for. Also I refrigerated for 30 min so they wouldn’t stick to my hands. Once they were cold I rolled them into one inch balls. And put them in the freezer to keep cold. I like mine colder so I put them in the freezer but if you like them soft put them in the fridge. I have made many different ways. One of my favorite ways was adding almond butter instead of peanut butter and white chocolate, craisens and almonds instead of chocolate chips.

First time I followed the recipe exactly and they were really good. The second time making it I tweaked the ingredients based on our preferences; leaving out the chocolate, and adding in 1/4 c. Chia seeds and 1/3 c raisins and using not quite  a third cup of honey.  It is definitely a keeper for us!

My kids love these! As written it's a little too sweet for us (me, actually. The kids don't mind). I decrease the honey to 1/2 cup or less. I keep meaning to try adding other things like cranberries or nuts but the original is yummy!

So simple and yummy! I definitely recommend running most of the oats through a food processor. it really helps keep everything easy to compress into balls that'll stay together. also I know there are meant to be super healthy, but I didn't have any honey, so I used some corn syrup instead. You dont need as much corn syrup as you would need of honey. It can get runny. And that ain't funny. Seriously though there are perfect little snacks!

Great recipe, can not make enough for children’s sports team. everyone asked for recipe.
My suggestion- rolling into balls is too time consuming+ not space saving. Lay batter in a log shape on wax paper, freeze,  cut into bite size pieces.

I made these for my daughter's volleyball team and they all loved them! Her coach asked for the recipe. I made one change just for my personal preference and to add more protein. I took out half of the flaxseed and substituted powdered milk for it. I also tripled the recipe and made bigger balls by using a 1/8 cup measure. I had to grease my hands  because they were sticky. Freezing them for 1 hour to set them was perfect.

Made this recipe from a different source and took on a 5-day back-country hike.  Not only were they tasty, but they kept their shape quite well in our packs.  (I did roll them in some oatmeal, which I had ground fine, before storing them; that probably helped keep them from sticking to each other.)

Made these for my husband to take hunting as a quick and easy snack.  He LOVED them as did my 11 year old daughter.  I will do less chocolate chips, add chia and craisins next time.  Terrific as is though!

I use natural creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy, and add about 1/4 cup unsweetened coconut flakes. I'm on my third batch in a month - they're wonderful! I have two in the morning and then an apple or a banana, and I'm good until lunch. So yummy!

This is an awesome no bake cookie. I processed the oats just a bit as recommended in another review. left out the vanilla by mistake. Also flattened mixture to cut into mini bars as another reviewer suggested.
These are perfect for me to take in my work lunch or just with a coffee or tea. so many possibilities. One change I may make is to reduce honey as they are pretty sweet. other than that, YUMMY!

This is a great recipe. I have made it just like it is. I also have a son that is vegetarian and goes to a nut free school, so I have also made some changes. I use 1/2 cup of sunflower butter instead of peanut butter and I have also made it with 1/2 cup of hemp hearts in place of the flax seeds. It is perfect just the way it is but some ideas for those that have allergies to nuts. This is kid approved. Mine all love it and an easy healthy snack for my son. Plus the protein iron and omega his little body needs.

This was a huge hit for everyone in my house.  My children, husband and I loved it.  It's difficult to find something small (under 200 cal) that's satiating and delicious.  This is it! I didn't change anything about the recipe & I don't see any reason to next time.

We use almond butter. Sooooo good! 
Occasionally add some crushed banana chips to the recipe. 
These are so tasty that one batch is never enough in our house.

Loved the recipe.  I, of course, added all sorts of goodies...just eyeballed the amount.  All of it was delicious.  Ground Flax Seed, Oats, Peanut Butter, Honey, Craisins, Chocolate Chips, Nutella Spread, Sunflower Seeds, Cinnamon, Vanilla. A very protein-based energy snack.

I did everything just about as written and it came out awesome! I used quick oats, and milled flax seed (not sure of the difference) and added dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. The smaller the ball, the easier to eat so I liked about 1 inch in diameter. Great recipe, will definitely make again!

These were a hit with my healthy eating grandchildren. I doubled the recipe  and it worked well. I don’t think you need to double the amount of chocolate chips........it was a bit too many for my liking !!!!!!

This recipe is pretty flexible and forgiving. I didn’t have crunchy PB so I used natural creamy PB. And I swapped in Agave Nectar for the honey. My kids love these. I’ll change them up sometimes and toss in a tablespoon or two of unsweetened cocoa powder or chia seeds. My hubby likes them with a little toasted coconut mixed in. Easy, tasty treat.

A HIT at home and office! To cut some calories, I used chocolate chips made with stevia instead of the sugary ones.  This recipe is a staple at my house.  Doesn't heat up the kitchen, kids LOVE them, healthy....WIN WIN WIN!!

I have made these several times as written and then started adding chia seeds with everything else.  You do have to add a little more PB and honey.  I love them.  I'm on meds that require you to eat first and these are great for that  reason, but I eat them because they taste great and are good for you.

I've made these 3 times already, after having just found this recipe a couple of weeks ago! I am always looking for healthy alternatives in the kitchen as my husband had a heart transplant in 2010. He has a super active sweet tooth, unfortunately, so this recipe was a Godsend. He LOVES these, we both do. One really good benefit is that it's a great source of fiber. No discomfort or bloating, either. Another wonderful benefit is the energy I get after having 3 or 4 of these. It works like a charm to have these with a cuppa Joe for a nice start to my day.

I added 1/4 cup of Chia seeds this last batch, and my husband is positively RAVING about how good they are. I prefer to use organic as much as possible.  In the event it looks dry, I just add a little extra honey. Oh Em Gee... Best recipe on here! Thanks for the recipe, and thank you especially to all those who took the time to submit their reviews, as they are SO important to the overall success of the recipe!!!

oh-my-god this recipe is fantastic.  Eat one of these with a cup of tea and it leaves you feeling satisfied and full.  Like some happy and magical chocolate bar, but far fewer calories.  I didn't have ground flax seed--just regular flax seed but it is all good...

These are yummy and so good for you. I did not roll mine into balls, I patted them flat in a cookie sheet and then cut them into bars after they froze for one hour.

It was delicious! I made the honey warm and it melted the chocolate chips. I also added crushed pecans.

2/24/19:  I doubled the batch and made 40 balls.  I did refrigerate the dough for around 30 minutes before rolling the balls, and they were still sticky to roll.  Don't try to roll without putting it in the fridge first!

As a breastfeeding mama and milk donor I like to eat healthy snacks so why not make one that promotes milk production! I do not like flax seed so that was left out. I also only had creamy PB on hand. They are in the fridge now as I review this but so far they tasted great!

I doubled this and made changes to pump up the nutrition. Instead of all flax I did 1/3 c. flax, 1/3 c. chia seeds and 1/3 cricket protein. If eating insects (hey, they eat us all the time) bugs you, you could use some taste neutral protein powder or just go 1/2 and 1/2 flax and chia so you still get omega 3s and increase the protein. I also swapped out the regular chocolate chips for dark chocolate chips and reduced the honey to 1/2 c. and they stuck together fine. I like to freeze them and pop them out as needed. Even my colleague who doesn't like healthy foods liked them. I forgot to tell her about the cricket so I may be going to hell for that. At least I'll be warm:-)

Yummy, but mine didn't exactly turn out... They wouldn't stay in balls but just flattened out if left to sit more than a couple minutes.  Not sure what I did wrong. I thought I followed the recipe correctly :(

Love them, Came out great though i did find this exact recipe on the back of the flax seed meal i used from Trader Joes. Glad I found this though, taste great. I did use chocolate chunks instead but the idea is the same, will definitely make again!

These are terrible. They have a weird not-cooked after taste. I ended up throwing them in the oven at 325° for like 15 mins,  & that seemed to help, but they're still not great.

Someone had shared this recipe on Facebook and they looked so yummy I had to make them.  I did add a little bit of unsweetened coconut flakes (about 1/4 cup) for a little more texture.  They turned out great!  My whole family loves them!

These are unbelievable! My husband and 3 year old daughter can't stop devouring them. They taste even more indulgent than cookies, although it's likely because they have the calorie content to match, but at least it's healthy calories! I followed the recipe exactly as written and added shredded coconut. I've decided to make these for the two Christmas parties I'll be attending this year.

I made these just as written and they were delicious.  The second time I made them I omitted the chocolate chips (to save on sugar), and didn’t put in as much vanilla (just personal taste).  I think the combinations are limitless!  Play with whatever you have on hand.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious. In addition to putting it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes, I also added 1/4 cup of chia seeds to increase the calcium. These energy bites are a delicious way to boost breastmilk supply!

I loved the taste and texture. I used a little milk to help them stick together and that worked great.  However FLAX SEED mimics estrogen. So if you don't want your female hormones out of balance which can cause excessive menstrual bleeding, use ground walnuts instead especially if you are eating them all within a few days.  I took them camping intending to eat them for lunch 4 days in a row, and a couple weeks later suffered consequences of too much estrogen.

Great tasting treat! I warm the peanut butter and honey before adding to the mixture. This thins out the peanut butter, and makes the honey easier to pour. In addition, this makes it much easier to mix everything together. Then refrigerate for an hour, so that the peanut butter and honey firm up.

Delicious! Has a bit of a hard time staying together when not chilled, perhaps another sticky substance like dates would help. I also added coconut because I love the texture.

I followed the recipe except used almond butter. Because my son is allergic to peanut butter. The energy bites were delicious!

My kids and I love these. My son is allergic to flax seeds so we just omit and they still are very yummy.

These are delicious!  I only had the regular size chocolate chips so chopped those in the blender, along with the oats.  Also added about 1/2 cup coconut to the mix, then rolled the balls in quick oats.

These were amazing. I made them for a camping trip and they travelled well, lasted for days, and were such a great camping snack. Now I make them to take for work lunches.

Delicious,  healthy, and easy! I had fun taking the basic recipe and tweaking it for different tastes. I always double it because they don't last at home or anywhere I take them! Definitely put the mix in the frig for 30 before rolling into balls. Twists I've added: almond butter, dried cranberries,  toasted coconut, chia seeds (still like flax better though), and vanilla protein powder. YUM!

These are tasty, easy snack options. Made as directed, except used a little less honey (1/4 c). I used a combination of instant rolled oats and instant steel cut oats. Took the advice of other reviewers and refrigerated the dough before rolling into balls. Used a level tablespoon per ball, and they were just the right size. Not too big to break your teeth off when frozen, and not to small that you eat a handful at a time. Will definitely make again.

Freaking awesome!!!!!   I made these for the first time today and they are delicious.  I substituted almond butter for peanut butter only because my stomach can't tolerate peanut butter.  Absolutely delicious.  I will be making these many, many more times.

This recipe is very good. I unfortunately did not have enough honey so my energy bites were less sweet than expected. Also, I only had chocolate chips that were a bit bigger than the mini size the recipe calls for. Despite those two shortcomings, I am pleased at the results! The recipe yielded 25 bites.  I am a PB lover since I was a child. This hits the spot. I guess next time I can try caramel morsels to try a slightly different flavor but equal idea. I will definitely make this again and have a stash ready to eat! EDIT: I made this recipe using butterscotch morsels. Try it! It is an excellent source of energy hands down. One can cut that "hunger" for about an hour. It is an excellent snack for those counting calories and if you need an extra bit of fiber believe me these are an absolute must in your diet while getting a freebee sweet! Absolutely a must have in my fridge.

I have made these several times and usually triple the batch, they are delicious!  Press into a parchment lined 8.5x11 pan.  I score them, then freeze and easy to break into small squares. You will save lots of time instead of rolling into balls. I typically process PB and honey first them add the nuts.

 Sliced almonds, mixed nuts, pumpkin seeds, use your imagination)and toasted coconut and get a chunkier bar.  Chocolate chips are added at the end so they do not pulverize. Thanks for a great recipe!

I added blended pretzel pieces(about a handful)I also  used creamy peanut butter, cooled in the fridge for about an hour and I was impressed by how yummy and healthy they are! And they’re so easy to make
These will be my new go to pre/post workout:)
I plan on trying new combinations next time.

I made these for Church fellowship.  They are very easy and people really love them.  I did refrigerate the dough before I tried to make the balls.  Since I made a double batch the dough started to get warm again so I popped in back into the refrigerator.  These snacks are delicious.  50 of them just disappeared off the plate at church.

These are so good! I used ground up walnuts and chia seeds instead of flax seeds, and I added in raisins. I also left the chocolate out of the balls and melted it and dipped the balls into the chocolate, sprinkled some sea salt on them, and refrigerated. Yum!!

I use this recipe weekly. These serve as a great breakfast through the work week. 

I mix the ingredients, refrigerate for 30 min, form them and freeze them for 2 hrs. They seem to set really well this way. 

Other than wait time, these take like 20 min of my time per week

Came out great!  I made 3 changes to up the ante on the health factor.
1. Added 2 scoops vanilla casein protein to add 1 gram of protein per ball instead of:
2. Removed chocolate chips
3. Used organic powdered lower fat peanut butter.

Macros ended up with a batch at 20, calories - 73.5, protein - 5.1g, carbohydrates - 9.2g, fat - 2.5g

Mine looked and tasted GREAT but I had to keep in the freezer because as soon as they came to room temp they turned into a gooey mess!!!  I followed the recipe to the "T" and even used a small ice cream scoop so I had 12 perfect round balls.  I want to know why mine turned out like that and others didn't, if I could figure that out then I would def. make more, otherwise #notagain  #toomessy

These balls are SUCH a hit. I bring them to every party, and they are always the first things to go. People are constantly asking for the recipe. I make them as the recipe suggests. The only change I make is that I refrigerate the "dough" for about half an hour before I roll them into balls, which makes it a little easier. Love these!

Delicious and easy!!  These are so good and filling too.  A great snack!  The recipe made 18 "bites".  Super easy to make with just a few ingredients.  It would be easy to swap the chocolate chips with fruit, nuts or mini M&M's.

I don't have flax seeds at home so I didn't add those in. I will for my next batch. I almost always eat bananas with peanut butter so I decided to add that in as a topping. I used creamy peanut butter and melted the chocolate chips, which I think made them chewy--just the way I like them! I tried them chilled and at room temp. I liked the chilled ones better! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

We make these for the kids for before and after their sports. The only change we make sometimes is substituting the flax seeds for organic Chia seeds.

Left out the flax seed for my mother and it was tasty.  I used a small cookie scoop to portion it but didn't roll it into a ball as I wanted a softer consistency.

Super easy, healthier than the average, snack!  And, 4 year old approved way to finally try oatmeal. :)  I had everything on hand, except for the ground flax seed.  I also had regular chocolate chips, not mini.  All turned out perfectly.  I added the honey at the end, and just squeezed in a little a time until desired consistency, enough to mold it together.  They are a tad sweet, for not sweet lovers, like myself.  But I rolled them small enough, that one or two make a great snack, or even, quick breakfast.

Super easy to make and delicious! Best recipe I’ve found yet for the energy balls. I prefer to ground up my oats with the ninja blender. The honey and peanut butter is the perfect wet ingredients for all the dry. I even add a little protein for extra.

Made these the other night and they were amazing. Everyone at work is asking me for the recipe. 
I altered it slightly to what is posted here. I adjusted the following:
-I used JIFs All natural Crunchy Peanutbutter
-Got a bar of dark coco 70% and cut it in to bit size pieces.
-I used Quinoa seeds instead of flax seeds
-I added a Scoop of Vanilla protein
-I added a splash(1-2 tbsp) of water when mixing
-Froze the mixture for about 5-10 minutes before rolling in to a ball shape and refrigerating.

I did make some changes, but the original recipe is phenomenal. You can make it as is, or try what we're doing. We substitute 1/2tsp Sweet Leaf Stevia powder for half the honey called for. I add 1/4 cup more peanut butter, to make up for the binding power of the honey. I also add about 1/8 tsp salt. These are phenomenal! Great as written, but done with the adaptations we make, even less sugar and every bit as delicious!

These are so easy  to make and taste delicious!  I made the recipe as stated and rolled out the bites.  When I had about 1/3rd of mix left, I added cranberries and chia seeds, so I had bites with and without the cranberries/chia seeds. Both the original version and my experimental version were delicious! Will definitely be making again!

Simply amazing and easy to make! It’s a great healthy snack especially on the go. I use almond butter instead of crunchy peanut butter because my oldest Son has a severe peanut allergy. It still tastes wonderful! The kids love them too. Thanks, Heidi!

My family loved these!  I did take the advice and put them in the freezer to hold them together.  We used the wheat germ and flax seed suggestion as well.  Recommend dark chocolate mini chips if you can find them!

I made these for my SIL after she had her baby so that she would have a healthy and filling snack when she got home and was tending to the baby. Of course, my girls and I had to taste test them first. I had to make a second batch for my SIL because my kids ate almost all of them before we left to see the baby! They are so yummy and my 5 and 10 year old picky eaters loved them! I am making a double batch today so the kids can grab these for snack rather than go for the fruit snacks!

I loved this! So good for breakfast and an on the go snack.  Since I didn't have crunchy peanut butter I added about a cup of almonds that I ran through a food processor. Absolutely delicious and I loved the added crunch. I made them into balls and then froze them, the dough was pretty nice if a little sticky. I'm considering adding  toasted coconut flakes next  :)

My family gobbled them up!!! Great  on the run breakfast treat. As the chef......I did not love how difficult it was to get them to stick together and form into a ball. I googled a  tip, will try next time. Tip is put mixture in fridge for 15 minutes. Makes easier to form into balls.

These are super easy to make, but I agree with other reviewers that you should chill the mix before making them into balls. Plus, if you are an athlete, freezing these makes them easier to take them on long runs or rides.

Very easy and good. Only change I made was to use quick cooking steel cut oats. Family loved them, would make again.

I originally found variations of this recipe on Pinterest.  I used smooth PB, dark chocolate chips, 1/2 t vanilla, and 1 t cinnamon.  I made 30 balls using a heaping teaspoon scoop for each.  It is a bit sweet for me, but my 13 year old son loves them.  Maybe semisweet morsels will temper it for me next time.

We make these regularly as a sweet treat! Kids, husband, and myself all love them! I use half fresh honey and half pure maple syrup along with mini dark chocolate chips.  Excellent recipe! Thank you!

My niece calls them cookie dough. It's a hit! The only changes to the recipe were adding a 1/4 cup each of hemp hearts and chopped peanuts, and using only 1/4 Cup of honey because I used sweetened smooth peanut butter.

Very easy to make and quick too. I don't like things overly sweet so I cut the honey back to 1/4 cup and these were still plenty sweet. Not something I would make again.

Super fast and easy to put together. That's what I'm rating for. As far as ingredients go, you can use most anything that suits you. For example, I didn't have ground flax on hand, so I used sunflower seeds, coconut flakes and chia seeds in its stead. You could also add your favorite chopped nuts and a whole array of other things that tickle your taste buds! Have fun! My kids loved the ones I made

I make these weekly. I follow the recipe as is and sometimes  add dried cranberries. I store them in a ziploc bag in the freezer. The kids love to grab a couple for a snack. I think they make a perfect quick breakfast for me since I am not a big breakfast eater.

My kids and I love this recipe. It makes about 24 Tbs size balls that I store in the fridge for quick a access snack. Variations I've done is add 1 Tbs Chia Seeds to fill you up faster or 1 mashed banana (eat within a week) for a new flavor.

Instead of flax I use toasted wheat germ. Its flavor is more mellow and not so harsh. I don't like flax. Also, I sometimes use almond extract in place of vanilla.

Wayyyyyyy to sweet! I'm rating this three stars, but after adjustments I would rate them 41/2 stars. I used 2 tablespoons honey, since it definitely does not need that much! I used chia seeds instead of flax, and omitted the vanilla. Pretty good, but 1/3 cup honey is WAY to much! All I could taste was honey before I shortened it down!

I made these but this was not the recipe that I was looking for. Though these are ok, a friend of mine made energy balls that were way more addicting than these were. This recipe has a pungent honey flavor and for some reason, the last few balls did not come together as well as the first bunch. The peanut butter and honey were evenly dispersed but this did not help. I ended up having to mix into another two tablespoons of peanut butter to hold the oats together.

Love love love these! I used a combination of ground flax seed with ground chia seeds and added a little smooth peanut butter to the crunchy because it seemed a little dry the first time I made it (and difficult to form). These are amazing!!!

Loved it...!! I sprayed a square baking dish with vegetable spray and sprinkled a light coating of sweetened coconut. Then put in the blended ingredients "smashing" it down like rice Krispy bars; also added a light coating of coconut on top. I doubled the recipe except for chocolate chips and popped it in the freezer for about 30 minutes. Then easily cut into 16 bars estimated at 150 calories each. I wrapped each square and put in Ziploc in freezer so they stay together nicely and are easy to grab and run...

Super easy. Made about 20 treats after hand picking and eating at least 3 lol! I used a medium scooper.  Be sure to pack the mix in the scooper then form with hand. This will help them stay together much better then completely hand rolling.
I added a few things to this exact recipe: 
Additional 3tbspn agave/honey blend. 
1/2 cup off-brand rice crispers. 
1/2 cup brown sugar oven roasted pumpkin seeds. 
Freeze 30 mins to hour

I did not have flax but I believe the rice cereal was a great substitute.  Now I'm hesitant to modify because these turned out so perfect.

Great recipe!

Made these this afternoon and love them!  I am trying to get away from eating protein bars, so this looks like a great substitution.  I followed the recipe to a tee, put them in the refrigerator for 30 minutes and then rolled them into balls.  I got 22 energy bites out of this recipe.  Even my daughter thought they were very good, and she is not an oatmeal fan.

Our whole family loves these!  I add toasted coconut (unsweetened), craisins and mini chocolate chips.  I also do the mixing in my food processor.  They come out great!

A am allergic to peanuts so I substituted sunflower seed butter and almond butter. I also added dried fruit and seed mix. Shared with 3 kids (1-5 yr olds) and they loved them!

Delicious!!!  I am going to substitute walnuts in place of flax seed next time. The peanut butter and walnuts sound great together!   I used creamy peanut butter too. Great, satisfying recipe!

I don't normally leave reviews, in fact this my first time to leave a review, but I felt I had to say this is the easiest recipe to make and taste so good that I really eat more then I should.

My family can't get enough of these!  So easy and a great snack or breakfast on the go!  The only update we made was a chia seed/ground flax blend vs. just the ground flax.  Same amount - 1/2 cup of the blend.  These are literally too good to be true!

I backed down a bit on the honey, added 2 T toasted coconut flakes and 1 T of chia seeds to the mix.  Very good!   Will try them with dried cherries next time -- I like the chocolate/cherry combo of sweet/tart.

I made these with chia seeds and almond butter: no chocolate chips. I was very pleased with the cookie like texture.  Next time I plan to make with sunflower butter so my nut allergy son can try them.

Big hit and so easy to make! I added about 1/4 cup of chia seeds and a handful of raisins and left out the chocolate chips. The kids still loved them because the honey makes it sweet.

I'm sure these are just as fantastic as the recipe is written, but since I didn't have any flax on hand I used about 1/4 cup of ground Chia seeds. My natural peanut butter required some heating to be smooth enough to stir and I realized a little too late that I should have let it cool more before adding the chocolate chips. As a result, my chocolate melted into the peanut butter mix, but it was still delicious. I used a small cookie-dough scoop to quickly form the dough into small bites.

These are very delicious. I followed the recipes as is. I'm surprised I had all the ingredients already at home. It's very sticky though. Next time I'll just spread it out on a pan and let them freeze first, then cut them into squares. I will definitely make this again.

These energy bites are AMAZING! I only wish the nutrition facts were as good as they taste! I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with about 10 balls, not too big or too small. If you're the kind of person wanting to eat these while also dieting (like me thinking these were a healthy snack for you) I recommend you only eat one energy ball at a time if you can't shake a craving for sweets. Just 5 of these energy balls (half the batch) contain 84g of sugar, 61g of fat, 135g of carbs, and 25g of protein! Just trying to forewarn anyone that is trying to find a healthy, good, on the go snack.

Easy and delicious.  I used wheat germ when I found I was out of flax seed and wish I wouldn't have. They taste AMAZING, but if I'd have used flax seed meal, it would've been wheat free and then safe to share with a gluten intolerant friend of mine.  Next time.  This time, my kids will devour these and I'll make them JUST as the recipe stated after a trip to the store.   Delish!

We made these two weeks in a row now and we absolutely love them! They're great to snack on in the afternoon when you need that extra bit of energy to help finish off the workday. We swapped out the chocolate chips for cashews and the second time we rolled them in shaved coconut. It's super easy to make this recipe your own.

I love these balls for a quick on-the-go breakfast. They are super easy to make and yummy. 
I add 1/2 cup sunflower seeds, half the amount of chocolate chips, and occasionally add some raisins to my recipe. I use a cookie scoop to make the balls and this helps keep them uniform in size.
I don't freeze them, just keep them refrigerated to firm the balls.

These are VERY tasty but I am not sure about healthy. By my calculations, each "bite" is worth about 5 Weight Watchers points. Of course, I figured that out AFTER eating 10. Whoops.

I used fewer chocolate chips and added a bit of cocoa powder. Really addicting.

Made a test batch tonight. All the same ingredients except I cut out the flaxseed. 
Used 1/2 the measurement amounts.
Rolled some balls right away. Found they were not staying together and were sticking to my hands. 
Put the rest of the Mix in the fridge for 15 minutes.  Rolling after that was easy, balls stayed intact and didn't stick to my hands.
Delicious!!!
Will make again.

I love this recipe as is and with tweaks. I used creamy PB and added dates, chia seeds, hemp seed no chocolate chips. My favorite thing to make and pop in the freezer and grab a few on my way out the door.  My 11 year old makes her own batch and adds the things she likes like chocolate chips and craisins.

I love this recipe..have made it for years. I do not like flax, so I omit, or sub chia seeds. I also use less honey, maybe two tablespoons or maple syrup. I personally like to use cashew butter, or a mix of that and peanut butter. I also think 1/2 bar of 90% dark chocolate is a great addition.

This is a great recipe. Good proportions. I substitute craisins for the chocolate chips to keep it healthier. I add about 1/3 of unsweetened shredded coconut. I also add 1/4 cup of water because I use regular oats. Love it! I make it every Sunday, and then I have a quick, easy breakfast for every day of the week. Instead of rolling them into balls, I simply put it into a 9x9 square Pirex dish and squish into a dense, evened layer. Then I cut into squares for each day of the week. I keep it refrigerated so it remains fresh. Enjoy!

Would add a little more moisture next time, to make less crumbly.  For more chocolate, more flavor used mini-chocolate chips.  Made for ski trip, people are asking for recipe.  Will make again!0 Thanks for sharing!

These are awesome!  The texture reminds me of cookie dough.  I didn't have flax so I substituted with more oats and some wheat bran.  I didn't add nuts but I think that would have been a good sub for the flax as well.  Other reviewers mentioned that regular creamy peanut butter doesn't hold it together but I didn't have that issue at all.   Another nut butter would probably work fine if you don't have peanut butter.  I would highly recommend.  They are better than a trip to the vending machine for mid-morning/afternoon cravings and actually filling.  I can only eat 2 at a time.  I got about 14 or 15 balls out of one recipe.  I will probably double it next time.

It is so hard to find healthy alternatives for our family and this one is an absolute hit!  I added ground chia seeds as well as raisins and craisins. PERFECTION!

It was a great recipe, and offered plenty of energy for running. The only thing is the balls dont stick together 100%, however  they dont really fall apart either. I would make them again!

I love the fact that this is so easy, and pretty healthy. The only thing I will change next time is that I will add little, if any flaxseed. To me, it was overpowering. But overall, a great recipe

These are a hit in my house!  The only change I made was to use creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy because that's what I had in my pantry but will make again and try with crunchy peanut butter and maybe some chia seeds.  I used a small cookie scoop to help form them into balls which made about 24 and they are the perfect size to pop in my mouth and eat in one bite or two.  Thanks for a great recipe that I feel like is more healthy than a store bought granola bar that has ingredients I can't pronounce!

A friend of mine brought these to a "Healthy Eating Supper Club" and I couldn't eat just one!  I went right home and made a recipe.  Unfortunately, my husband and son strolled through the kitchen about the time I was taking them out of the fridge and they were gone in no time.  We were all  impressed with the simplicity of the recipe and very satisfied with the taste.  I never give 5 stars...but I loved them!

Always a favorite. They go quickly. I also run the oatmeal and flex seed through my NutriBullet before adding the other ingredients. Makes them more uniform and the flax seed a little easier to chew.

Made this and it was excellent. Didn't have flax so we did chia seeds instead. We also added sun flower seeds for extra energy. Set them in the freezer for about 10min and they turned out great. A toddler friendly snack as well (with the chocolate chips).

Easy to make gluten-free and vegan!  I used certified gluten-free oats,  gluten-free golden flax meal, Enjoy Life  vegan gluten-free mini chocolate chips,  and substituted 100% organic maple syrup for  the honey.  I mixed it altogether with organic natural crunchy peanut butter, a teaspoon of salt, and added a generous tablespoon of natural bourbon vanilla extract.  Since I doubled the recipe I put it in my stand mixer to make sure I incorporated all the ingredients. I love that the peanut butter and flaxseed help lower cholesterol! Wonderful easy recipe!

I made this to hopefully curb my appetite for snacky items . Let me tell you it is well worth the small amount of time it took to make them. The only thing I changed was the mini chocolate chips. I used dark chocolate chips because I thought the recipe called for them and so thats what I had on hand. I've never been a big fan of dark chocolate but it was delicious!

These were gobbled up by my kids - perfect as an after-school snack!  Followed the recipe exactly and got excellent results.  Will try adding a little chia seed next time.  This is a great base recipe to tweak to you own preference.

I made these today and followed the recipe ezactly. Waaaay to sweet IMO and I have an insatiable sweet tooth! The honey overpowered the chocolate and peanut butter taste. I would add salt maybe next time to balance the flavors. I really want to love these but was disappointed :(

I LOVE this recipe! It is so easy and yummy! This is my second time making it, and I did add in a tablespoon and half of unsweetened cocoa powder for a little more of a chocolate flavor. I will definitely continue to make this whenever I can! Thanks!

A friend gave me this recipe a couple of years ago and my whole family LOVES it!  They are a bit messy to make, but it's worth it.  We don't taste the flax seed at all with the peanut butter/oats combination dominating.

Very good, natural and healthy. I omitted chocolate chips since I didn't have any. Added 1/4 cup of cocoa powder instead. (Maybe this cuts a few calories?) Did creamy instead of crunchy pb... Once again it's what was in the cabinet. Super! Try it out!

I made these exactly as recipe is except I added toasted coconut. My kids loved these even the picky ones!  I told my grandson they were energy balls so he came up to me out of the blue and said "Grammy I need some energy" lol I love that they are healthier than cookies.

An everyday staple in our house. Recipe is delicious as written. We have tweaked a bit to our tastes by reducing the chips in half, and adding some flax, chia or other healthy grains and seeds as we have. We actually triple the batch (for our family of five), roll onto parchment on cookie sheets and freeze. We then put nto a large freezer bag, and grab as an on the go snack in the am, or whenever a healthy bite is needed. We much prefer them in the freezer. They are a bit or work to make and roll, so we do a team effort, wetting our hands sometime to help the rolling process.  Worth the effort.

I made this as written and with minor modifications and my entire family can't get enough of them. I use it as a substitute for my sweet tooth! I will continue making these and will continue to experiment using a variety of nuts, seeds, dried fruit and chocolate chips.

Although they turned out looking devious, my family and I did not care for the flavor, I think maybe a little too much flax seed.

Simple, easy, and delicious! I used whole flax seeds the first time and definitely use my grinder to have them as ground flax seeds now. Experimented with rolling the completed balls in extra oats to make them available as a lunch snack for my husband because he can't always have them straight from the fridge. Seems to do the trick. My whole family enjoys these bites and I make this recipe at least twice a month (and hide some for me!)

Excellent.  My husband is diabetic, so I did not use honey. I used a couple of tablespoons of coconut sugar and a couple of tablespoons of a low-glycemic sweetener called Agave 5. This worked out well, except that it was difficult for the balls to hold together. Honey probably helps since it's sticky. I'll bet it's even better with honey.  However, this is a wonderful recipe that can be easily adapted to whatever ingredients you have available.

These are delicious! For the reviewers who don't like flax seed, I personally didn't taste it. It was mostly there for texture. 
     I loved the overall texture and flavors of the honey and peanut butter. I will defiantly be making these again.

Yum! I made these and substituted 2tsp cocoa powder instead of the chocolate chips because I didn't have any on hand. I also added a tsp of chia seeds.They're really delicious. I used a tsp cookie scoop to set them out instead of my hands and it made exactly 25. I might be hiding these from my hubby.

Loved them! The first batch followed the directions except I added approx.  1/3 cup Chia seeds also. The second batch I omitted the chocolate chips and honey. Instead I grabbed two very ripe Bananas out of the freezer and mashed them.  I added approx. 1/4 c unsweetened cocoa powder along with the rest of the ingredients including the addition of the Chia Seeds. Depending on the size of your bananas you might need a bit more rolled oats.  Not as sweet as the originals but everyone preferred them.

Anything this easy and kid friendly gets a 5 from me!
I was looking for something to put in my daughters bag for a school snack and my toddler ended up loving them just as much! Easy and healthy! I used regular chocolate chips (not minis) only because thats what I had on hand.  I ended up with 26 one inch round little bites! perfect!

Oh yum! I have to admit I had my doubts that I would even eat these, but wait until you freeze them! This is the PERFECT snack for SAHM's that seem to find themselves accidentally skipping breakfast, lunch or dinner while waiting on everyone else. This snack will be a staple in my freezer for sure! I ground my Flaxseed in my NutriBullet and presto, done in seconds! Thank you for sharing such an awesome & HEALTHY snack:)!

Our pediatrician gave us this same recipe for a child who wasn't eating enough.  To my surprise, our extremely picky eater likes these!  I use creamy peanut butter instead of crunchy and use slightly less than 1/2 cup otherwise I get complaints that it is too peanut buttery.  I've tried rolled oats vs. Steel cut and the roll oats are preferred by my kids.  You can add nuts, dried fruit, chia seeds or whatever you like.  Mine prefers mini choc chips and mini dehydrated marshmallows:)  It's a compromise I'm willing to make to get him to eat oats, ground flax seed and peanut butter! I often serve them instead of dessert.  I keep them in the fridge as they are less sticky when cold.  You can't detect the flax seed flavor by the way.

Made this with a group of middle schoolers for their Cooking Crew!  Like another reviewer, we heated up the peanut butter and honey first before adding to the dry ingredients. It mixed up much easier that way. The warm wet ingredients did melt the chocolate chips, but the end product still was a hit! Many kids and staff loved them and asked for the recipe.  Chilled the batches flattened on a cookie sheet with parchment in the freezer for about 10-15 minutes to help stiffen the "dough" enough for rolling into balls and that helped tremendously. Finished balls went on a parchment-lined tray into the freezer for about another 15 minutes before serving. Added 1/4C roasted & lightly salted sunflower seeds and 1/4C roasted & lightly salted pumpkin seeds too. Might try unsweetened coconut flakes sometime as well.

These are very tasty and filling too, which is what you want with a healthy snack. But, when making the recipe, the balls kept falling apart when I was rolling them. I think it was because I didn't use as much honey as the recipe called for. Instead, I added more peanut butter but that didn't work too well. I got them together as well as I could and froze them immediately hoping that would hold them together and it did. It's a great snack to keep in the fridge and grab when the hunger pangs strike.

Followed recipe except for the following: Only used 1/4 c chocolate chips(that's all I had), added 1/4 c coconut flakes and almonds. I put almonds, whole flax seed, chocolate chips and coconut in the ninja to grind up before adding the other ingredients. These are awesome prior to freezing also!

These are my (and my teenage son's) new favorite snack. They are easy to make and I just store them in the freezer in a ziplock bag. They are a great pre/post workout snack and an awesome late afternoon energy boost.

I have a huge question, should I keep them frozen. I'm using them for a protein snack after a long 1 hour-2hour Practice. If I need to keep it in the freezer till practice and just find a freezer or fridge for the remaining 2 hours, should I do so!? Help!

Delicious! Just made these, I couldn't even wait for them to freeze for the one hour. They are good before the setting time and after the setting time. I did add coconut like some other reviews suggested and raisins with less than called for chocolate chips. These were great and I'm trying to make myself stop eating them. Oh, I also added some pecans I had. I will be making them again.

They came out great!  Husband- and daughter-approved.  I doubled the recipe and made over 60 balls (about 3/4" each).  They are perfect for snacking or on-the-go breakfast.  I'd like to try with less chocolate chips and add raisin.

Very delicious!  I used whole flax seeds instead of grounding them and like the crunch from it.  I also think the extract is unnecessary next time as the other natural flavors are so delicious.  I will double this next time as it is sticky to make and they go fast!

Easy, healthy little snack that takes care of the sweet tooth.  Not half as messy as I thought it was gonna be.  I'm gonna double the recipe and make more next time.  Good to keep on hand for my kids.

Such a simple and quick recipe! My girls loved these as part of their brief (3-minute) break mid-way through their curling game. Just the right amount of yumminess and nutrition! I will definitely be making these again -as is!

I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 cup flax and 1/2 cup chia seeds (that is what I had on hand).  Next time I will cut the amount of honey as I found them to be a little too sweet.  My kids and husband are asking for another batch.  Great treat to keep in the frig for a quick breakfast or snack.

I roll it out in between wax paper to make one big "bar" and put in the freezer for about 30 minutes.  Then I cut into squares and roll into balls.  This makes them pretty close to the same size.

I substituted flax seeds for chia seeds, used creamy and not chunky PB, used agave and not honey, and didn't put vanilla or chocolate chips (solely based on what I had at home, not for preference). Turned out great anyway. I toasted about a full cup of sweetened coconut flakes on the stove, mixed in 2/3 cup to the ball mix, and then rolled the balls in the leftover coconut flakes.

These make the best snack ever!  I made the recipe as is and used old fashioned oatmeal, and they were great.  Next time I will try the 1 minute kind to see if the finer oatmeal pieces improve the texture, making the oatmeal pieces less pronounced.

Perfect for sweet tooth when trying to stay healthy & not over eat! Just one of these after dinner satisfies my craving! Easy. I used creamy almond butter.. Definitely a staple for me. Keep in fridge to stay fresh after!

A great recipe. I find it easiest if you refrigerate the "dough" for about 30 minutes before you roll into balls. This helps keep it from sticking to your hands. 

One of my favorite substitutions for this recipe is to use ground chia seeds instead of flax seeds. I like the taste and texture better this way.

Great base recipe as is or you can tweak it to your liking.  I didn't have flax.  I added some chopped walnuts, raisins, and cinnamon. I also added about a 1/4 cup coconut oil. Yum!

Very easy.  Delicious!  Kids gobbled them up!  I wore non-latex gloves while rolling to make the mixture not stick to my hands.  Worked perfectly.  I made smaller sized balls-more pop-in-your-mouth size!  Made 36.

I found it to be a bit gooey, so I added more dry ingredients. For a double recipe I added a cup of dessicated coconut and about a 1/2 cup chia seeds.  You really can't go wrong with these....

I actually made these at first as horse treats (I left out the chocolate and vanilla for that reason) and they actually turned out too delicious to save them for my horse. I ended up baking these mostly because I didn't want them super sticky and wanted to be able to pocket these for easy feeding. It was really simple (put them in at 350 for 15 minutes) and they turned out PERFECTLY in between crunchy and chewy. Needless to say my whole family munched on these and there was none left for  the horses!

Awesome! To make this gluten free (because oats are not gluten free! unless you buy special gluten free oats which cost A FORTUNE), I used millet flakes and chia seeds instead of oats. I also dipped the balls in coconut flakes. I also skipped the vanilla extract. Yummy! And crunchy! Next time I'll add a little bit of chocolate flavored protein powder.

I really like this recipe.  It's quick & easy to make, and uses ingredients I normally keep on hand.  It also lends itself well to modification based on personal tastes.  The reason why it's getting 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the portions.  I doubled the ingredients & made approximately 1" balls, and I only ended up with 25.  Since these keep well in the freezer, I wanted to make a BUNCH that could be used for team/after school snacks.

Great, the kids loved them. I used almond meal instead of flaxseed because that is what I had.

This recipe works so well with my family's schedule. We are all busy and athletic and having these one hand is so convenient. I recommend taking then out of the freezer a few minutes before eating them. Don't microwave them, even for a few seconds, because they hear up unevenly.

Yummy and easy.  Almond butter instead of peanut butter and chia seeds in place of flax; added almond slivers and chopped cranberries.  Instead of vanilla, I put a few spoonfuls of applesauce.   I made 10 ping-pong sized balls.  I haven't calculated calories, but it's such a great starter for the day!  No-bake aspect was just what I wanted!

I used creamy PB instead of crunchy and they turned out great. They stuck to my hands quite a bit, but they tasted great.

I would definitely make these again.  I replaced the flax seed with almonds.  I did have an issue rolling these out as they were very sticky.  I finally used a spoon and wet my fingertips and was able to accomplish.

I just made these last night and they are incredible. I love dark chocolate, so I went with Hersey special dark chips instead of semi sweet. I would love to hear how everyone spooned these out? I started with a spoon and then transitioned to using my hands, but that got super sticky.

Love this recipe. I use creamy natural PB. Also add 1/8 - 1/4 cup finely chopped roasted almonds. I use Hershey"s Special Dark Chips which I partially melt.  This makes the whole ball chocolate with small chocolate bits.  I keep these in the frig at all times. Just one satisfies my cravings for something sweet.

My kids and I LOVED these. We didn't have flax seed, so I just chopped some cashews and threw them in. I also used regular sized choc. chips because that's what I had. They were amazing!!!

This is a very healthy snacks for kids and adults. My whole family liked it! Instead of Flax seeds, I used Trader Joe's Super Seed Blend.

Being out of flaxseed meal, I used almonds instead. I also had only regular chocolate chips, which I thought rather large for this use. I processed the almonds and chocolate chips in the food processor until fairly finely ground and continued as per the instructions. These were an instant hit with the whole family, and I will make them often! They reminded me of no-bake cookies, but healthier and with no cooking. Thanks for this keeper recipe!

Only had agave nectar and used that instead ( because I was out of honey).  I found it was hard to form in balls (kept sticking to my hands and fingers).  Maybe because I used the nectar.  Put in the freezer just now so we will see.  I am sure they will taste good.  I will update my review when they are done.  Update ..they came out fantastic!  Next time I will use honey.   Hopefully that will make them easier to form into balls.  Update again.  Lol!  Made exactly as written and they were very hard to form into balls.  Used another reviewer's advice and used a spoon but it did not work.  I am sure they will come out ok but I am not sure if I will make them again.  Not worth the aggravation.

My kids loved these. I doubled the basic recipe but in the second half I added nuts, ground chia seeds and coconut. The coconut was the perfect addition. I will continue to do the same thing with doubling and making the two different kinds.

We used to make these years ago and I had forgotten how good they are!  Only thing is that I took out the Flax Seed but I also added Raisins like I did when I made them in the Past!  Another addition would be coconut!  So easy to make and quick energy!

I doubled this recipe and pressed it in a parchment lined 8 inch square pan (16 bars) and refrigerated overnight. I did not have enough honey, so I used half honey and half agave nectar. I used half of the ground Flax and replaced the other half with wheat germ. I also added 1/2 cup Brewer's yeast to make it lactation friendly. I had to add some liquid because it was a little dry, so I used about 2 Tbsp soy milk. They were pretty yummy and it saved me some time because they did not need to bake like the other lactation recipes I've tried.

These are so great! The best part about a recipe like this is you can switch it up to your liking.  I used coconut, pecans, etc.  I throw some of it in the blender and make the pieces smaller just as a family preference.
