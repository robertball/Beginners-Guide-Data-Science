Made as directed with maytag blue cheese, needed a little larger pan though! Fabulous flavor and a HUGE hit at our Christmas dinner with Prime Rib.

I don't know what this is, but it doesn't fit any conventional definition of a bread pudding. It's an interesting dish, but don't try it if you're looking for a bread pudding dessert.

We love this dish with some spicy ribs. The blue cheese really helps cool your mouth.

This dish is every bit as decadent and amazing as it sounds, though realistically I'm not sure what I could ever serve it with because it is SO rich and heavy. Wonderful, but whoa. It's definitely a special occasion-type thing. And I agree with @Laurie in PA about needing a bigger pan: the took about an hour to set - not 40mins - because it was really jam-packed into that 9X12 dish.

I followed the recipe exactly and I have to say this was excellent.  I will make this again for sure and will also serve it to company.  It looked rather dry when it came time to bake it  - I was tempted to add some milk but I decided to follow the instructions all the way - and it came out beautifully moist, wonderful flavour and great texture.  Can you tell I enjoyed it?!  Thank you to the poster for the unique recipe.  I will be doing up a beef tenderloin for Christmas - this would be great as a side.  The serving size is generous but that means leftovers, which are even good cold.
