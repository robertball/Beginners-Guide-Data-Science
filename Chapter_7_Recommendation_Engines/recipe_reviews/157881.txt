The only change I made to this recipe was to subsitute an extra 1 tsp of chutney to replace the teaspoon of apricot jam since I didn't have any. The flavor was very good but it was too dry and almost burnt from baking for so long. When I make it again I'll use a 2 quart casserole instead of a 3 quart. I'll also shorten the baking time from 1 hour to 1/2 an hour before adding the egg mixture and then continue to bake for only 15-20 minutes after adding the egg mixture. I'd also add another egg to the milk to make it thicker. This really does have great flavor and I definitely recommend it with the above changes.
***Update: I made this recipe again with the changes I suggested. We all loved it! The bobotie was moist and delicious. I've passed the recipe along to family who also love it. I'd give it the recipe five stars with the changes.

Oh my goodness.  I would NEVER have thought of putting an egg custard on top of this dish.  I have also never eaten minced beef quite as sweet as this.  I didn't have any chutney or jam, but used peach jelly as a substitute for both, and it turned out awesome.  I surprised my wife with this recipe, as she works longer hours than me.  She loved it, as did the kids.  I served it with roast potatoes and minted peas, and now have my extended family hooked on it too.  I am now going to try other South African recipes because this one was a real surprise.

Super easy and taste great!  I m a South African living abroad and regularly impresses guests with this recipe combined with the South African Yellow Rice also on this site.  Ideal when served with a tablespoon serving of mango chutney as well as sliced bananas.

Try sticking a few lemon leaves into the bobotie so that it just sticks out on top, before the bobotie goes into the oven(about 3 leaves).It just add to the flavour.

Very good.  I had a dish very similar to this a couple of times recently while on a safari.  Easy to make and wonderful. Thank you.

at our African themed potluck, this was one of the best dishes at the table!  I used peach jam instead of apricot (and really think that for a teaspoon, any jam would work fine) and used extra because I left out the chutney.  it continues to be requested!

I loved this recipe.  I used a milder mango chutney because I no not like things too spicy.  I was hesitant to add the egg mixture but it added just the right amount of creamy gooness.  I did add 2 tbsp of flour to the eggs so it would not be too runny.  FABULOUS!  I will maked this again and again, for sure!

This recipe had very interesting flavor, but the cooking time needs to be reduced by almost half.

Great Recipe! My husband is from Cape Town, South Africa and so It really reminded him of home. Only suggestion would be to use a smaller pan than a 9x13..Otherwise it was awesome!

A little too sweet for my liking, but my boyfriend came up with a brilliant idea to spread the apricot jam on top and serve it for breakfast.

This was the very first time I had ever made or eaten bobotie, but my whole family really enjoyed it! I almost always substitute ground turkey for ground beef, and in this case I used a whole two pounds of the turkey. The only other difference was that I reduced the cooking time. I just baked mine right in a cast-iron skillet for about 45 minutes before adding the egg and then cooking it for another 25 minutes. This turned out just right, and if I had cooked it much longer, it probably would have burned. This really is an excellent recipe! I am happy that I stumbled upon it and we will definitely be having this again!!

I have used other bobotie recipes, but this one is my favorite.  The ingredients blend well for an interesting flavor.  As mentioned in other reviews, I used a smaller baking dish because I didn't want the meat to dry out.

This is a really tasty dish, especially served with rice, bananas, chutney and coconut.   There is one tip missing from the instructions though -  place the dish of boboti in a water bath in the oven;   this prevents it from drying out.

After trying  Bobotie for the first time during a recent trip to  Cape Town, SA, I just had to try making it once I got back home.  This is a very good recipe, but I did incorporate some of the recommendations of other reviewers. I couldn't find apricot chutney, so I used 1 tbsp + 1 tsp of apricot jam, and it worked fine. The recipe doesn't say to drain the excess fat after cooking the beef, but I did. When you put the beef mixture into the casserole dish, pack it down, so that most of the the egg mixture will remain on the top of the Bobotie. After you've squeezed the milk out of the 2 slices of bread, break them up into small pieces, so they get evenly distributed throughout the mixture. I used a 2-qt casserole dish instead of a 3-qt, and I also used 2 eggs instead of just one.  Also,  I reduced the initial baking time from 1 hour to 30 minutes, and after adding the egg mixture to the top, I let it bake for a full 30 minutes to ensure that the egg was completely cooked and had even started to brown a little.  I served this with 3 side dishes of sliced banana, a raisin sauce (also from this site, made earlier in the day and allowed to chill), and a simple tomato/cucumber/onion/chives/lime juice salsa, the same way it was served to me in SA. I also made an African Yellow Rice (also from this site), as a fourth side dish.  Topped all this off with a chilled bottle of white SA wine, and got the thumbs-up from my wife and daughter.

I would use a smaller pan next time so it's not spread so thin.  I couldn't find hot chutney, so I just added some red pepper powder to regular chutney. Used a food processor to mince the onions.  Pretty tasty, I'll make it again

This recipe has good flavor, but does not look like the Bobotie I ate several times in South Africa.  The meat mixture was crumbly when made according to the directions.  There was no custard top as when I poured the milk/egg mixture on top it all sunk in around the chunks of browned meat.  The baking time was too long as everything was over done.  I am going to make it more like a meatloaf with raw burger mixed with the spices and after that has firmed up, making the custard on the top and reduce the baking time.

I cooked the onions and meat (ground turkey) in a large (12-inch) cast iron skillet, then baked the dish in the same skillet. Baking times were reduced to 25 mins for the first step and 20 mins with the topping. Delicious. I thank the previous reviewers who said the recipe dish size was too large and cooking time too long. Even with my modification it was quite shallow, but the moisture was perfect.

This was sooo good!!  I made it for a themed dinner, but now I'm going to put it in our regular dinner rotation!  I did reduce the first cooking time as others mentioned, by half.  I also couldn't find chutney, so I used more apricot jam and some hot pepper flakes.  Also, this works just fine with lactose-free milk.

Recently returned from South Africa where I enjoyed this dish at our Band B, (which also served dinner upon request!)  This recipe tasted just like the one made by our hosts.  I added some sliced almonds to the meat mixture, about 1/4 cup.  I also sprinckled some garlic powder into the mix before stirring as other recipes for Bobotie call for garlic cloves.  I added both apricot preserves and chutney.  It was delicious and as I had the ingrediants I made it again.  Not very hard and it tastes wonderful with rice.  Cooking time was spot on for me.

I'd never made this dish before and was excited to find a recipe for it. Pretty darn good! Spiced it up a bit and made it more flavorful and the family (including kids) enjoyed it!

This is very good. I read the reviews and decided to cut the cooking time to 30 mins, then 20 mins after adding the egg mixture. It came out wonderful, but I could see it becoming too dry if cooked longer. It was perfect with this timing. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly. Thanks!

I make it regularly and often add slivered almonds, and sometimes add a bit more curry powder as we like everything..hot!   My husband prefers not to eat much beef, so while the original recipe called for ground lamb (or mutton) I have also made it with turkey

Didn't make any changes and came out good. Next time I will try an 8X10 casserole pan as the 9X13 was a little thin.

Loved the first attempt i made. 

I excluded the curry and the apricot jam as we not fond of eating fruity supper. it still came out well and delicious.

Made this for my fiancé because he was homesick. Now he asks me to make it regularly. Easy to follow, only I add extra apricot as another South African friend of mine suggested. And serve with yellow rice. This is my go to to make him happy.

Used 1 lb ground lamb and 1lb ground beef. Was more liberal with the curry. It was a big hit. Thanks for the recipe.

We love this! It rates highly with our South African friends too! I serve it with South African yellow rice, by trixie on this site. It's a winner all round!

It's the taste of South Africa and one of the dishes that warms the heart.

I have made this many times, and it never fails to please — but I substitute ground lamb for the ground beef. Delicious!

Loved the flavors! I had peach hot sauce that I used in place of chutney and I had peach preserves that I used. I too didn't think it needed to be baked 1 hour before the custard because you pre cook the meat. However my husband thought it was mushy. Next time I will reduce the milk by half.

I changed the amount of servings to 1 and made this for my invalid mother-in-law. She doesn't eat very much and this served with a portion of rice and chopped tomato went down an absolute treat. I added a photo.
