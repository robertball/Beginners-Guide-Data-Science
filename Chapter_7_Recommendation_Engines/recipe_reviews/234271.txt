I've been making turkey for 30 years and this has got to be the best recipe yet. I usually don't brine but decided the morning of Thanksgiving to give it a try and used the quick method (doubling the salt and sugar and letting it sit in the refrigerator for 4 hours) and it resulted in the most moist and flavorful turkey I've ever made. The other difference was that I used a fresh rather than a frozen turkey and it came out so tender and juicy, even the breast meat which typically comes out on the dry side. Even my mother (a very picky eater) enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing!

This was my first turkey ever made solo and my mom loved it! I was worried since my turkey was a bit larger, so I just watched the thermometer and it turned out great. The brine is what makes this- you could anything to the butter when coating the bird, but the brine leaves the meat super juicy. Thanks for the recipe!!

I've used the overnight method before with great results and was thrilled to see the quick brine method - I tried it and was happy with the results.

Awesome recipe. First time brining my turkey and it turned out better than expected. Everyone usually fights for the dark meat. This year people went for the white meat because they're so juicy. Delicious! We made a 24lb turkey and brined it for close to 2 days because the dinner got moved back. Wonderful results and thank you the the recipe!

I usually use the "Out of this world turkey brine" or the plain "Turkey brine" recipe from this site, but decided to change things up a bit. Wow! Wow! WOW! I made a 22 lb turkey and tripled the recipe (probably was a bit too much). I have to admit I was very leery of using the sugar, but it had great reviews so I decided to go for it. The gravy was so good (and I'm not a real big fan of gravy). I admitted to my husband toward the end of dinner that I had changed the brine recipe and his response was "Well, looks like you found a keeper". Definitely easy and definitely worth trying!

I buy my turkey already brined, but otherwise follow these directions. I think it turns out much better this way than the traditional 325 from the beginning.

I started hosted thanksgiving when I moved into my house 5 years ago for about 23 ppl.  I always get a 23lb turkey, double this recipe, and it turns out juicy and delicious! This photo is from 2014 on my 1st try and I haven’t wanted to change it up ever since! Very simple.

My turkey turned out beautifully! This was only my second turkey and it turned out juicy, golden brown and absolutely perfect. I did brine it a lot longer, probably about 24-hour as compared to the 14-recommended. This may be the reason I didn't really get a lot of juice for my gravy.

I would have liked to give this a 5 but this wasn’t quite to my taste. I followed the recipe exactly but found the meat to salty. The tenderness and moist meat was perfect but to much salt. I didn’t use any additional salt for the stuffing and gravy and they were perfect for flavour. Next time maybe not Brine it for the full 24 hours or reduce the amount of salt used in the brine. just a little tweaking.

Spectacular! Perfect for the Holiday, the only amendment was adding a couple of bay leaves, sprig  of rosemary, thyme, and 8 whole cloves following the brine time I added all the herbs to the standard stuffing along with a whole garlic sliced at the head.
