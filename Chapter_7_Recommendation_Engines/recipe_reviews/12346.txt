This pie is awesome!  I put chocolate chips on the bottom and then caramel sauce on top after it is baked.  It's rich, but always a favorite.

I have not made this yet but it sounds like the pie I had at a restaurant today.  I am confused about the description of "stiff egg whites" when you don't even beat them.

This pie is served at a steak restaurant here- Angus Barn- my husband had it and wanted to make it at home.  This recipe is VERY close to the restaurant version!  YUMMY!

This is delicious, I added mini chocolate chips also!
The only problem I had was, the bottom of my crust did not bake all the way through. When I make this again, I will blind-bake the pie crust first.

I added chocolate chips and baked them in a pan as cookie bars.
