Excellent flavor.  I like to simplify the process by chopping the chocolate in my food processor until, then pour the hot cream down the feed tube and give it a whirl... in seconds you have wonderful ganache. Use this ganache warm as a pourable glaze, let it cool to room temp (over night) and use like a standard frosting, or chill until firm and whip with a heavy stand mixer until it's light in color and spreadable. You can even use this ganache to make authentic chocolate truffles - just roll the chilled ganache (unwhipped) into balls and coat with cocoa powder, chopped nuts, or whatever.

I made this ganache for some truffles I did for a friends b-day.  I used dark chocolate and followed the recipe to a T with the only addition being a heavy dose of creme de menthe candy flavoring.  I then put the ganache in the freezer until it was thick enough to roll into balls and refroze the balls so they were rock hard before dipping them in more dark chocolate to create a shell.  I then melted a little green chocolate (available at Michael's stores) and drizzled it over the top.  Absolutely Heavenly.  Store in the refrigerator, incredibly rich and creamy with a nice mint flavor.  To die for...

Even though it is not a "real" ganache... i.e. double boiler... It is still awesome. To use this recipe as a frosting, prepare the recipe as is usinga metal bowl, but after all the chocolate is melted, place the bowl in a bigger bowl with ice and water and slowly beat the same amount of Heavy cream you used earlier to the mixture then beat until stiff peaks form. Use ove chocolate... You will be amazed...

I made this and poured it into a tart pan with a thick graham craker crust then topped with raspberries and served with fresh whipped cream. So pretty and good too.

I think if you like hops (which are bitter) you'll love this! I used good quality chocolate, but still found this recipe tongue-paralyzingly harsh (the sides of my tongue are still unhappy with me). I had double the amount of heavy cream and add 1c confectioner's sugar to make this palatable. When I usually make ganache, I use semi-sweet choc, so I guess I need to stick with that. It might be my own taste, but I really wish there had been some warning that this could be really in-your-face AND offensive.

Wonderful, fast, and easy! This recipe makes a lot of ganache, so if you are making a layer cake, you can afford to be generous between the layers.  I have made this twice and the crowd goes wild!

This was excellent and easy to make.  I beat 1 cup confectioners' sugar into half the ganache to make it a little sweeter since I was using it to top a bittersweet chocolate cake.  It was perfect, rich and glossy!  This makes more than enough to top TWO cakes!

This worked very well with my cake.  I used semi-sweet and bitter-sweet (60%) for two different layers of the cake and was very pleased with both.  I let it cool just moments before going nuts draining it into the layers. Raves.

This was actually quite good. It has a richer and bittersweet flavor. It needs something to counter the bitter for some taste buds. We liked it though. I made a buttercream frosting to border the ganache which worked out perfectly.

This is the first ganache recipe I have ever tried, and now its the only one I use. I have tried 10 or so other variations and none are as easy, never-fail, and tasty as this one. I recomend this recipe HIGHLY to all cooks.

I made this recipe following the directions exactly, but I used one 16 oz bag of semi sweet chocolate chips.  I also added about 1/4 cup of powdered sugar just to make sure it didn't turn out too bitter.  It was absolutely perfect and smooth.  I used in on a layer cake with the recipe "too much chocolate cake" and it was a huge hit.  I also topped the cake off with shaved semi sweet chocolate.

This is some serious ganache =)) I used it as the filling and topping for a dark chocolate cake and it tastes really good with the frosting. I haven't had a slice of the entire thing as a whole yet because its for someones birthday tomorrow but did try it with the frosting and it is delish. I did use half and half with success.

I'm shocked so many people rated this as 5-star with bittersweet chocolate.  WAY too bitter!  Still the best recipe as it uses both cream and butter but I used semi-sweet and it was perfect.  Also whips up wonderfully when firm for a fabulous filling or frosting but must sit at room temperature for a while or it will be crumbly. 
Rating as-is 1-star
As modified, 5-star.

This was a great recipe! I used semi-sweet baking chocolate and whipping cream because that's what I had on hand. I halved the recipe and melted in the microwave. 45 seconds on full power, 30 seconds, stirred, 20 seconds, stirred, 10 seconds, stirred and it was smooth and lump free! I had made some chocolate heart-shaped cupcakes which I then dipped into the ganache. Simple and delicious! Thank you for sharing.

I absolutely love this recipe! I couldn't find bittersweet chocolate, so I bought semisweet instead, and it came out fabulous. I used it to top my chocolate eclair dessert. Of course I had to use half the recipe, and there was still more than enough for the topping. I give it 5 stars.

Very good taste!  I loved the fact that it was not overly sweet. The texture for frosting is a little runny but it did harden after it was frosted.

Serch no further. Best Ganache I have made. Having made quite a few using different methods this was the easiest method that I have ever used. Obviously the quality will depend on the chocholate so I am rating the easy and the look. This will be the standard Ganache for my daughters cakes from now on.

I've used this recipe quite a few times. I really like it very much and it's soo easy to use. The recipe is very forgiving. Very flexible. The one thing, I never alway to cool completely because I'm using it immediately. It totally gives that satin look to it when it dries and it quite gorgeous to look at. Even though I've used as directed with bittersweet, I have also used regular semi sweet as well.

This is the only chocolate cake recipe I use! It is so easy to make and it turns out perfect every time. No changes needed. I make a chocolate ganache from All Recipes (Ganache II) to drizzle on top.

I used semisweet chocolate and cut the recipe in half to put on butter cookies. For my first ganache it turned out really good. Will definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing.

I made this Ganache and the instructions were very simple to follow and it was amazing. My family was extremely impressed with how it looked and it tasted even better. There was even left over Ganache for me to take home and use for strawberries.

I had to add sugar to mine only because the baking chocolate was unsweetened. (it's all I had to use).
I wanted to eat it by the spoonfuls!!!!

So simple and so-o-o good! I used semi-sweet chips and glazed a yellow cake. I added a glaze, threw it in the freezer for 10-15 minutes and re-glazed, repeat.
I had a piece of cake for breakfast this morning. I might have one more... :) Oh, I added a little vanilla.

This was so easy and delightful taste, I used salted butter, didn't seem to matter, not as sickeningly sweet like so many frostings! Going to add mint extract this Friday I'll let you know!

Super quick and easy to work with. I let it cool then used it as cake icing. Looked and tasted great!

Great recipe. Although I added a couple ounces of light corn syrup to give this ganache some shine. It worked out pretty good!!! Definitely going to use this recipe again.
