We really enjoyed this recipe!  If you like sauerkraut and mustard flavoring, then you will like this.  Next time, I may decrease the sauerkraut liquid a little, so that the flavor isn't so strong.  But, that change certainly isn't necessary.  It is very good!

I couldn't get the fries cooled in 30 minutes so I think I'll cook them separate next time or serve the brats and kraut over mashed potatoes. Maybe it's due to high altitude? The sausage and kraut were SO SO yummy! Thank you!
