This was different but very tasty. I thought 2 peppers were going to be way too much but the heat was just right for us . You don't taste it  at first but it sneaks up on you. I recommend using only 1 pepper if you are sensitive to heat. This got thick in the blender quick so I was unable to get it as smooth as I wanted but that is my only complaint. The flavor combination in this is good and unique and is one worth trying.
