I wasn't sure what kind of tea bags to use, so I opted for 1x black tea and 1x Yogi chai tea. It was spicy! Quite different & strange to my pallet, that I loved it. I even added ice to the leftover tea for a nice way to cool off a hot afternoon.

Not bad, but it was missing something.  A pinch of ginger maybe?  I used Lipton bags and the tea itself was fine.  A single peppercorn does not add enough punch.  I also felt that this is scant for 3 servings, but a good size for just two.

Recipe was simple make and had excellent taste. You might want to make sure you check on the peppercornsqty to add more if you would like an extra kick. I used regular Lipton Yellow tea bags and tasted very well.
