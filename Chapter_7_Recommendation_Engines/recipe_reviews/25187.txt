This title seems misleading. I was looking for baked wings and these you have to fry then bake? Too time consuming to be labeled easy.

I made this recipe for a party I had at my house, there was about 10 people there... 10 people ate almost 3 lbs of wings!!!  It was a HUGE hit.  I had NO IDEA where to buy MSG so I just left it out, dont know what it would of done for them but it was GREAT without it!!  It was a messy prep, but so worth it in the end!

Very tasty and easy.  We reduce sugar and it still tastes great.

These were really great.  I was worried about them being soggy because of reading another review but after baking for an hour they kindof carmalize and they are soft yet crunchy...my kids loved them and they are picky.  Kinda sweet I will use less sugar next time and I totally skipped the MSG. Enjoy.

I threw a party this past weekend and decided to include these wings as one of the appetizers and they were GREAT! I only used about 1/2 tablespoon of MSG and it turned out fine. Everyone commented on how good they were, but even if they hadn't I could tell because they FLEW off of the plate! My husband is probably the biggest fan, as he has been begging me to make them again this week.  I guess I'll be making these more often!

The taste of the wings was excellent. However about 10 minutes into baking them it seemed like there was way too much sauce and I was afraid they would turn out soggy, so I took them out of the oven, took the wings out of the pan and continued baking them without the sauce. They turned out great this way. I had to change the recipe to fit the amount of chicken I had, so this could very well be the reason I had the problem. Either way I will definatly make these again, I took them to a party and they were a big hit!

I made this for a church potluck, not quite sure how it would turn out.  Frying the wings took awhile.  I added dried (jarred) ginger and a little black pepper to the flour and more ginger to the "sauce" - I'd add even more next time.  The wings disappeared at the potluck and I thought they were tasty.  Just not sure I'd spend the time to make them often, because it was time-consuming to cut apart whole wings and then fry them (my frying pan would only hold 4 comfortably at a time).  But for special occasions or potlucks when I'm not pressed for time, I'll keep them in mind.

These are good and exactly the same as the sweet and sour drummettes on this site, I mean, EXACTLY, only difference is that this recipe has margarine and msg, which I find you don't need, because when you eat it, you won't be able to tell you had butter in the oil or msg.  Good recipe, served this with rice and asparagus (hey, it's asparagus season, lol).

The reason I gave this recipe 3 stars is because I actually made a lot of adjustments to it. I did not add the soy sauce on top because people in my family do not like saucy wings. and I did dip the wings in the egg but instead of just flour I used breadcrumbs as well and baked them for 45 mins at 350, they came out fantastic, and my family kept asking for more. Great for a side dish or an easy appetizer.

Great recipe, but shocked that MSG is used. Monosodium Glutamate is a substance that is added to enhance the flavour of your food but also to make you feel full much faster (appetite suppressant). Many, many people have an allergy/sensitivity to this and it should never be added to food.

Otherwise, the recipe is great!

Made these last night. Soooo good!! I kept flipping my wings so that they wouldn't be too soggy on one side. Will definitely make again. Good for dinner with family or entertaining. Looking forward to both with this dish!!

Very yummy. Used boneless chicken breasts cut into strips (and skipped the MSG). Even my pickiest eater raved about them!

These are REALLY labor intensive and the ingredients seemed odd to me but I went with my gut and gave them a try. YUMMO. I didn't have the msg but they didn't need it.

I just tried this recipe for the first time at my annual thanksgiving dinner this week. The recipe called for chicken wings but I decided to use drumsticks instead. I chose chicken instead of turkey this year and it was a great hit. Everyone at my dinner kept coming back for more and complimented me on how good the chicken was. To be honest, I didn't expect it to turn out so well but it did. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us!!~

Good recipe. I did bake thew wings for about 20 mins before I put the sauce on as I was trying to avoid fried food. I also cut down on the sugar a bit. Thanks for the great recipe.

Had to make wings in a hurry and was not disappointed.  I fryed the wings as directed but then baked them on a broiler rack (or use a cooking rack) to keep the wings from getting soggy in their own juice.  I did put any sauce on until the wings were done. Then tossed them in a bowl of Franks redhot wing sauce.  The wings had great texture and taste.  My husband does a recipe from Alton Brown that takes all day! These definitely rivaled his wings. Thanks!

I made the recipe exactly how it was written and for the people afraid that the wings will be soggy not the case the amount of time in the oven turns the sauce into a great crispy coating that is wonderful!  You will not be disappointed give these a try:)

Crispy wings with an amazing sweet sauce... so, so good! It’s well worth the extra time it takes to fry them first. I omitted MSG and used low sodium soy sauce, but did add about 1/2 tsp salt.

I used this recipe for boneless, skinless chicken breasts and they turned out delicious.  I didn't have any MSG, but it turned out to be unnecessary.  Great, easy, and wonderful!

The taste was OK, but when the baking time was up, my wings were actually floating in the sauce.  I removed them from the sauce and placed them on a baking sheet and continued to bake them at a low temperature (275) for over an hour until they dried out a bit.  Perhaps 1 cup of vinegar, and 3/4 cup of water and soy sauce is too much liquid?  If I make these again, and that is not likely, I would brush the sauce onto the wings, repeating several times as they were baking.

Very good.  Was a little time consuming, but the results were well worth it. I didn't use the msg either.

Just follow the recipe and you won't be disappointed!  Fry the wings and use the right amount of sugar.  It was worth it.  Plus if you need MSG, it is often in the spice isle called Accent.  I have heard a lot about MSG but if you don't have allergies then don't worry too much about it.  It is in everything from Chef Boy-R-D to beef jerky.  Just don't put it on everything you eat; a little common sense and reasonable man theory applies.

This recipe was great. Next time I would cut the sauce mixture in half to see if I can get the wings crispy.  Other than that perfect.

Took this dish to a party and they were the first to disappear. First time I had made them and will definitely make again. A few changes though. I used about half the sugar and instead of MSG, I used seasoned salt. When I got ready to pour sauce over wings, it looked like too much, so I only used about half. I checked about half way through and it didn't need anymore, so I threw the rest away. Came out perfect!

This came out great. I did not have any MSG and I used extra virgin olive oil (no butter added). Oh and I seasoned the wings before drenching in egg and flour...nice flavors.

Although I wouldn't consider this a baked chicken wings recipe because you have to fry the wings, it was absolutely fabulous! I got rave reviews from the sauce flavour! This recipe is definitely a keeper (for those cheat days)!
