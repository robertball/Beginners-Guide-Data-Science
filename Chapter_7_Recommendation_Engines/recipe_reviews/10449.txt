Excellent recipe.  Just like my Grandma made.  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon to the honey and toasted the pignoli (pine nuts) before sprinkling on top.
I've also made them in individual servings, mounding a heaping spoonful into foiled muffin cups.  Makes about 32 smaller servings.  Great for giving a few small portions to the lovely elderly Italian couple next door!

I tried to copy my Grandmother's recipe.  This was close, but not quite right.  I was told that I should have cooked the honey longer to give it a darker color.  It was not sticky enough, so the presentation was a flop.... literally.  Very messy, too much work, not worth it.  For those who attempt this, here's the best tip:  When you roll the dough into "ropes", simply cut the ropes into the sizes you want them to be.  Once you fry them, they will plump up into ball shapes.  I wasted so much time shaping the dough into balls before frying them... a step that was completely unnecessary unless you have so much time on your hands that you don't know what else to do with your day.

This recipe is almost identical to my grandmother's recipe brought with her from Naples, Italy.  The only difference is that she added an extra egg, and 2 extra tsp. of baking powder.  They come out lighter and less dense.  You do not have to roll them into balls.  Just roll into a rope, cut into pieces and fry in hot oil.    To solve the problem with the honey being too thin to hold everything together, my grandmother always heated the honey with sugar.  If using a large bottle of honey, use 1 cup of sugar and heat on the stove till bubbly.  Then toss the strufoli into the hot honey, remove with slotted buttered spoon, and begin mounding onto a platter with the buttered spoon or, if you hands can take the heat, buttered hands. They will hold together nicely into a nice mound.

Excellent, served these after a huge meal (the feast of the 7 fish, Christmas Eve) and the table had tons of cookies and cakes, panettone and these were gone, everyone loved them they really are delicious, thank you so much, I have replace my grandma's recipe with this one.  One thing, I made them a little larger only to save a little time but turns out that everyone liked them that way so I’m just going to keep them a little larger to save the chef some time, plus they were tender in texture and I really liked that.

Great recipe.  Exactly like my grandma used to make.  Next time I would make the dough balls smaller (about the size of a pistachio) because they swelled so much in the oil.  I will be making this again!

THANK YOU Rosina!  It's so nice to have an authentic, DELICIOUS recipe for these after the stale-tasting ones I bought from our local Italian bakery!

This recipe was easy to follow and the results were great... light and fluffy. I added lime zest instead of lemon which gave a great zing to cut the sweetness of the honey. I also did not roll into balls prior to frying, and still ended up with round balls. The 4 serving recipe yielded 13 cupcake wrapper full. Also, I used toasted slivered almonds instead of pine nuts. This is perfect to serve with tea or coffee. I would highly recommend you try this.

Very similar to my grandmother's recipe.  Rather than pinola we used blanched, roasted almonds.  My brother and I were assigned the task of shelling all of those almonds.

Also, preparing it was like an act of penance as the ladies would form the strufoli into a ring while the honey was still very, very hot.  Of course they kept a bowl of ice water handy to cool their hands before the skin peeled off!

Thank You Rosina!  I have made this two Christmases in a row.  My Italian Family loves it!  My Mom who is from Naples said it it just like my Grandmother use to make.  Sometimes, I add just a bit of extra lemon zest. Happy Holidays!

This was a great hit when I was serving an Italian meal and wanted something Italian for dessert.  I guess this is not really Italian, but I had the oil very hot when I fried the first batch, and the balls came out darker and with a different flavor.  After that I lowered the temperature, but my guests thought the multi-colored/mult-flavored result was a nice touch.

It was very good with a few substitutions! Instead of lemon zest, my family uses anise extract or anisette liquor. We usually don't add nuts, but I tried chopped pecans and it was pretty good.

I was making a dish for an Italian inspired dinner and took these delicious morsels. Guests were picking at them throughout the evening. You can not eat just one! Making the little balls was a little tedious, but worth it in the end. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was an excellent recipe! It was easy to make. I didn't even bother making the ropes, just broke pieces off dough and made balls. I have added this to my regular Christmas baking tradition and looking forward to making them again next year!

First time making Strufoli and they came out perfect! I used the zest and juice of 1 orange instead of the lemon zest. I put all dry ingredients in my kitchen aid with the paddle and slowly added wet ingredients until dough just starts to come together. Then I dumped it onto a floured board and kneaded until all flour was worked in. I used my deep fryer and fried at 338 degrees. Fantastic recipe!

This came out very good.  Very close to what I remember my grandmother made when I was a kid.  I didn't have lemon, so I left it out and had just a cup of honey and it was enough with extra to pour over the top.  It was pretty easy to make and great results.
Thanks for the recipe.

I'm not Italian and had never heard of these before, but they looked so appetizing I just had to give them a try. They were delicious. This will certainly become a favorite recipe. Thanks for sharing! UPDATE: Most reviewers complain about the tedious task of rolling the pieces of dough into little balls, and I was no exception! However, you can skip this step altogether. After you have the dough rolled into ropes, simply cut into little pieces and drop them into the oil. They come out perfectly round and you've saved a huge amount of time!

Have been using this recipe for years. Its great!  Strufoli is a tradition in my husband's Italian-American family. I was very happy when I found this recipe and even more happy when everyone loved it! We used to buy it at our bakery but it always smelled a bit eggy. This recipe is perfect! It is pretty easy to make, just a bit time consuming when making the balls. I add some candied cherries in addition to the sprinkles to give it a festive look.

Great recipe. It brought me back to my childhood visiting NYC to see my Italian family. It tasted just like I remembered. It was very easy to make. Cutting the strips and making ropes took the longest but, not too long. I put balls into honey, removed with slotted spoon and put in cupcake tins. Thank you for sharing this treasure!

I was so nervous to make this, my Grandmother use to make it and I remember it being such hard work...this was so easy! Next time I may add orange zest instead of lemon just for a change. I omitted the nuts as my Grandmother use to leave those out as well. I made this as a surprise for my Mom, she is going to be pleased. Thank you.

We add a little whisky to our recipe and we also deep fry them in a shape of a bow tie. These are my favorite holiday cookie. Been eating them since I was a toddler!

Just made these for Christmas and came out just like my great grandma used to make. I followed advise and did not roll out the balls, they fried up perfect! I used a spider to move balls around in oil in batches and to scoop them out. I boiled honey and coated balls in batches. I only added Christmas sprinkles. This recipes makes two round tins. I highly recommend this recipe, enjoy!

I've been on the hunt for a GOOD strufoli recipe for the longest time. The ones I've tried in the past just didn't work out right for me. Either they were too hard or too dry, the dough was annoying to work with, etc. This recipe was a dream to make. The dough came together relatively fast and easy. The only changes I made were taking out the lemon zest and adding anise extract to the egg mixture before I added it as my family and I like anise flavored strufoli. I also added some of the anise to the honey, but very little. The other change I made was I baked them at 350 for 15 minutes and they came out perfect. Next time I'm going to try frying them and the only reason I didn't fry them was because I was out of oil and didn't know it until I had already started to roll them. No big, though. They were still fantastic. I'll be using this recipe from now on! Thanks for posting it.

I grew up eating this in NYC and thought I'd give it a try. Followed the recipe to a tee. I liked what I made but didn't love it. Reason being, they were too dry. Ok, so it could've been my fault. When the recipe says roll dough to a pencil size and cut into ¼" pieces, they mean it. I didn't take it seriously because it didn't seem big enough. However, when I put the balls of dough in the oil they immediately expanded to twice or three times the size. Now that could've been why they were so dry. Another reason could've been because I let the honey drain from the slotted spoon too much. I underestimated the power of the honey. Next time I will keep as much honey on them as possible. And last but not least, I also wonder if adding that extra half a cup of flour was the reason why. I'll make all these changes next time and see how it goes.

Excellent recipe...I left out the pine nuts, Lemon Zest, and put 1/2 Teaspoon of Lemon Juice. One reminder, when rolling the dough into balls (pardon) be precise not to make them to big. "Tiny"..otherwise you will have a mouth full.. 
Great Recipe. My family members and friends ate everything!
