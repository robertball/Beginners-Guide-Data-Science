I really enjoyed this unique meatloaf recipe - however my picky family was not a fan of the fig topping.
More leftovers for me!
The meatloaf was perfectly complemented by the Idahoan Signature Russets. I was pleasantly surprised with how great they tasted, without all the work usually involved in making mashed potatoes. A great and simple weeknight meal.

This smelled divine cooking in the oven! I wanted to make this recipe but couldn't find any fresh figs, so I bought dried figs and reconstituted them. I'm positive this would have been better with fresh. If I were to use the reconstituted figs again, I would cut them into teeny tiny pieces. The figs and the onions complement each other very well. I aimed for some in every bite. I wish I had put more feta on top than what was called for.

My family liked the way it tasted, but I think they would have liked the texture better as a traditional meatloaf. I think I will make this again as a traditional meatloaf, mixing the fig, onion and feta into the meat with some breadcrumbs and another egg. I'll report back on how the family liked it that way.

It was very good! Like the other reviewers, the figs were an interesting addition that I did not particularly care for, but omitting them made the recipe just fine in my book! What struck me was how easy it was to make. I was able to throw the entire meal together in about 20 minutes, not including cooking time. Made it easy for me to get housework and homework done while everything was cooking. And the Idahoan Signature Russets Mashed Potatoes were a great and easy way to make mashed potatoes without the hassle of peeling and chopping regular potatoes. Highly recommend them to anyone and everyone!

This was hard to review. We all thoroughly enjoyed the Idahoan Signature™ Russets Mashed Potatoes. They are a delicious substitute for when you don't have time to prepare homemade ones (what I usually do.) The meatloaf, however, none of us four liked it. I did substitute feta with mozzarella but that was not the issue. The figs were too sweet and mixed with the onion, cheese and meat, there was too much going on in each bite. We'd definitely eat the Idahoan Signature™ Russets Mashed Potatoes again but not the meatloaf.
