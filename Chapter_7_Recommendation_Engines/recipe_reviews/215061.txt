4 1/2 stars I'm surprised that I tried this. It's rare that I"d buy ground chicken. The burgers were good, even tho I didn't make the sauce (don't care for mayo or dijon) Instead it seemed to scream "Bacon!". I loved the apple, syrup, bacon combo. I'll make this again.

Used egg whites and a different apple type (gala?).  Used George Forman to grill burgers. Excellent flavor.  Will definately be making again.

I love coming across a recipe that is easy to make, healthy and that my kids and husband rave about. When cooking (I cooked in an electric non-stick skillet- no oil to worry about) this recipe we had the pool man here closing the pool and he asked "what's that SMELL?" - I made him a burger too :) I also used a random apple that I had on hand and used egg beaters. They were tender, delicious, quick to cook. You may want to double this if you're feeding more than four- they go fast!

Update- I've made this now with just about every kind of apple. I've made it with and without onions. Last time I grated a carrot and finely chopped celery in with the apple. I have used panko crumbs, Italian style crumbs and once in a pinch, stuffing (oh yum). I haven't been able to screw it up no matter how I try- oh and I use honey dijon not regular because that's what's here.  The real secret is the apple and maple. The apple keeps everything tender so don't worry if you don't have an onion, use powder.

This dish is fabulous.  I am lucky enough to have the original master mind behind this recipe cook it for me.  We loved it.  I craved it for days and days after having it.  Made with homemade buns too.  I had to rave to all my family about what a wonderful cook and friend I have :)

I doubled the recipe as I made this for some big eaters. They were impressed! The sauce was spot on, the type of Dijon was not specified so I used the grainy kind and it looked nice too. The apple/onion mixture to top the burgers with was good, maybe a bit oily but the bite and sweet together was pleasant. I used a red onion as I wanted to use it up. The burgers themselves I found a little bland, but my guests said they were delicious. I was out of Italian seasoning but made up my own using the "Italian Seasoning I" recipe with modifications. Chicken isn't a naturally flavourful meat, so I was a little surprised at the few spices involved. The maple syrup or its sweetness did come through the burger at all. The apples in the meat mixture also did not add anything taste or texture-wise. I will definitely season the burgers differently next time, but overall these are quite tasty. My rating is 3.5/5, my guests 4/5.

So easy and delicious my husband had me make it two nights in a row! I added some cayenne pepper to the 'special sauce' which gave it a nice little kick.  I also substituted a no-salt seasoning blend for the italian seasoning. Recipe works well with ground turkey or ground bison as well.

We made this last night for dinner.  Everyone loved it.  We used ground turkey instead of ground chicken.  The burgers came out moist and flavorful and the topping of apples and onions was terrific!

Very Good!  I used ground turkey as there was no ground chicken abailable.  I was using the grill and worried that the mixture was too wet and would fall through the grate so I added about a half cup of bread crumbs to firm it up.  My non burger loving girl said I can make them anytime.

We tried this tonight for dinner and it was really good!!! We made slightly larger patties to fit the buns so we only got 5 burgers. The sauce was delicious and the burgers were great! The only thing we'll do differently next time is to add a bit of habanero or jalapeno to the batter to give a little heat to off-set the sweet. We'll definately make these again, thank you!!

Really a very delicious base recipe.  I made it to spec, and thought that while it was sweet, it was very bland.  I added smoked provolone and turkey bacon to the sandwich, but burger still needs a little more oomph.  Will be making again, but will experiment with spices a bit.

I made these this past winter, and they were just so delish! I used a yellow delicious apple instead of Granny Smith, and b/c of my Caribbean heritage, seasoning was not spared! I'm making it again tonight, cause it's just a FAB burger. Thank you!!

Loved this!  I never, ever rate recipes and I have really had some good ones.  I used a thin Ciabatta instead of the hamburger rolls but other than that stayed true to the recipe.  The first bite reminded me of chicken maple apple saussage.  Really loved it!

This was surprisingly delicious!! I took a risk by making these burgers because the ingredients together sound a little odd and ground chicken can be rather bland. Boy was I wrong! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a small honey crispy apple, and my boyfriend and I ended up eating a second burger each! I topped the burger with a slice of turkey bacon, which is a must, it kicked up the recipe to a 5+. It added a smoky flavor and a nice crisp.

Tasty and gluten-free too, as long as you serve them on gluten free buns or with gluten free pasta.  A pleasant change from beef burgers. The whole family enjoyed them.

I made this tonight and we loved it. As the other reviewers say, the sauce is amazing. I didn't have any dijon mustard, but had some spicy picante apple mustard from a local orchard which went really well with the overall apple theme. 

As some of the other reviews had said that the burgers could be a little bland, I used almost a full tsp each of salt and pepper, and added a few diced onions and crumbled bacon as well. It was definitely loose and "gloopy", so it would never work well on a standard outdoor grill, but did very well in the skillet. As my girlfriend is on a diet, I used lowfat mayo, sugar-free syrup, and completely cut out the oil, cooking the burgers with no added oil in a non-stick skillet. This made for an incredibly healthy meal. Even with two burgers, (no bun), this still came out to only about 8-9 Weight Watchers Plus points.

My new fave chicken burger! However, I feel embarrassed to admit that I was reading the ingredients, and not the instructions, when I assembled these burgers, so I actually had the dijon mayo sauce *in* the burger! Though it was a bit wet (once I realized what I had done), it did better from chilling for an hour, and grilling on a grilling mat to make sure nothing fell through the grates. Oh my...SO good! And my guests raved. Next time, I will follow the recipe, but I do think the mayo (which contains eggs - a binder) and dijon (or even dry mustard) has a place inside the burger, as well as on top, so I will make that modification. The maple syrup and apple made this a huge hit, and they went beautifully with caramelized onions. No one even needed a bun. Great to freeze as individual patties on parchment as well.

These are actually really good! It tasted quite breakfast-y but I did enjoy it. We used hot dog buns because its what we had. For some reason, my kids (3 and 1) didn't eat it, but the adults liked it!

This was very good!!! My husband & I agree this is one of our favorites. Thickening the sauce might make it less messy. But that’s part of eating a good burger!

These were good but the sauce was more mustard-tasting than I like so the second time I went really light on the mustard and it was much better. My 9 year old didn’t like it though and normally she loves all burgers.

This recipe is a definite keeper and should satisfy most of the fussy eaters.  The only change made was to add breadcrumbs as the mixture appeared rather moist but this apparently had no adverse effect since the Tnot only raved about them but also requested copies. Thank you "ski."

A family HIT, didn't think the sweet chicken would work that well, but in the middle of my burger we all thought for a sec it's like a fancy restaurant dish! Spot on... We added mushrooms n that worked very well,but bacon would have been yummy too.... TYVM for sharing

Nothing special as I had hoped. I would make for friends who have never eaten ground chicken burgers. The 4th star is for the minimal effort for preparation and cooking.

Wasn't in the mood for tacos or chilli and didn't want to make chicken salsbury steak. 

Tip: When first put down patties in pan to start cooking take hot oil with spoon and pour over patties prior to flipping so patties do not break.

I used a little more Italian seasoning than calls for.

When I made this recipe, I doubled it but kept the number of eggs at one, otherwise the mix would have been too loose.  I also broiled the burgers, allowing me to make them all at the same time - broiled on the second shelf, 6 minutes each side.  Perfectly done and moist.
The sauce was great, but in the future I think I will reduce the real maple syrup in the meat to 1 T.  I felt that between the sweetness of the apples and the syrup in the sauce, the "whole package" ended up being too sweet for my tastes.  Served on homemade King Arthur's Perfect Burger Rolls.

SOOOOO GOOD. This is seriously the best burger I've ever made. The only thing I didn't follow in the recipe was that I put more Italian seasoning, added some red pepper, added some Mexican seasoning (julios), and added wasabi to the sauce. Also, I blended the apple before putting it in the ground chicken because I knew I wouldn't be a fan of an unblended texture.

I made this last night and it was terrific!  Followed the recipe exactly except for chopping the onion instead of slicing it.  I recommend making the "secret sauce" several hours ahead of time so the flavors can meld.  I think this would work well with ground turkey too.  Even picky eaters at my table said it was very good.  Will definitely make again.

I was pleased with how the burgers came out; didn't need nearly the oil it called for. I used a few sprays of canola oil, lite mayo in the sauce, and it came to only about 200 calories per patty, not counting the bun.

Instead of ground chicken and apples I used spiced apple chicken sausage and removed the meat from the casings.  I followed the rest of the recipe as written.  This was very good and I can't wait to make it again.

I love this recipe. I've made them 4 times since I found it a month ago, so quick and easy and yummy ??. I find it just as easy to spoon it into the pan. Paired with homemade oven fries. I just used regular mustard. Not a fan of Dijon.

WOW!  What an amazing blend of flavors.  I served these with some pasta with pumpkin cream sauce for a fall dinner my boyfriend couldn't stop raving about!
