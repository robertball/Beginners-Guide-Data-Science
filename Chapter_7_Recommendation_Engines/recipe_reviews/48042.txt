For low fat muffins these are pretty good! I changed a couple of things. I added whole wheat flour instead of regular and added a tsp of cinnamon and a tsp of vanilla. They are NOT sweet, as Jenny already said, so if you want sweeter add more sugar. They end up being 1 point on the weight watchers plan...marvelous!!!

This is an incredibly good recipe to be low fat!! I used a Braeburn apple and used half whole wheat flour, too, to get the maximum low glycemic benefit. I also always preheat my muffin oven to 500 degrees and then turn to the baking heat when I put them in. Particularly with the whole grain products, this gets them crisp while the leavening has made them fluffy and puffy.

People who say this is dry or not sweet enough are probably overcooking them. Using applesauce or vinegar-milk in lieu of apple or buttermilk will also decrease the sweetness tremendously and cause them to be drier.

"Low fat" and "bran" don't have to mean flavorless, which these were, even though I tried adding more cinnamon as reviewers suggested. I recommend making the "Apple Strudel Muffins" instead, but a) replacing half the flour with oat bran, b) replacing the butter with applesauce, c) cutting the sugar in half, and d) adding a teaspoon of cinnamon. Voila! Low fat apple bran muffins that taste good, unlike these.

Incredibly heavy and satisfying muffins, but the apple gets lost along the way. Here's my improvements: I add 1/3 cup flax seeds, 1/2 cup rolled oats, 1 cup diced apple, and substitute 3/4 cup applesauce for grated apple. A family favorite!

Delicious and very hearty!  I used whole wheat flour, and I also increased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup instead of 1/4 (the weight watchers points is still 1 even with the extra sugar!).  They were pleasantly sweet, although I could probably get away with using 1/3 cup. I also added some cinnamon, and used a whole apple chopped with the peel on istead of just a half.  The extra amount of apple made these terrific!  Next time I think I'll add a pinch of salt.  I individually wrapped these and stuck them in my freezer, so I'm interested to see how they hold up!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe gets 5* from me.  Low fat and good, two things that are hard to combine.  We like these muffins a lot, and they are only 2pts if you are following Weight Watchers.

Made these several times now and found myself making a few changes.  Added 1 tsp vanilla (I used the powder), a pinch of salt, 1 tsp. cinnamon, the other half of the apple, chopped (I used a Granny Smith so it wouldn't disappear into the apple when baked), a 1/2 cup dried cherry, cranberry, blueberry mix I bought at Sam's Club...and I had always used the water/dry buttermilk powder combination for the 1 cup liquid buttermilk until I read the review by RTR.MAR to use 1 cup apple juice with 4 tblsps dried buttermilk powder...very nice addition.
Thanks much for listing this recipe Jenny!!

absolutely marvelous! I also used whole wheat flour. I substituted brown sugar twin and used applesauce, 1/2 cup for the grated apple. I also used the 1 t. vanilla and cinn. I did mix the applesauce in the batter rather vigorously. The muffins came out lighter then usual. Sometimes I sprinkle a little sugar twin on the top of the batter right before I bake them.I make them constantly and they fit right in my weight watchers program.

I found these muffins surprisingly tasty considering the lack of fat (and relative lack of sugar). I added some raisins and cinnamon to mine, and that seemed to help give thema  lightly spicy flavour.
The bran makes them very fibrous, and they are much denser than regular muffins, but if you are on a diet these are great!

ps, I wish i could try substituting apple sauce and dried buttermilk, but i'm from the UK and you can't buy those things over here! :-(

This is a great low fat recipe, and easy to make but I found they are a little bland. I added 1/4 tsp of Nutmeg, 1 tsp of Vanilla as well as some raisins and Cranberries.

This is an AWESOME recipe!!!! I made mine with half whole wheat flour and used skin milk soured with lemon juice, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla, a whole apple grated, and used 1/4 cup splenda brown sugar. They turned out wonderful and for once actually pretty guilt free. I'm going to experiment with some more flavors tonight. Thank you so much for this awesome recipe. Okay so I fooled arounf with this recipe a bit... added white choc chips and pumpkin pie spice, cherry flavored craisons, and also my absolute favorite one banana. I thought the banana natch wasn't going to turn out but I ended up with the most moist delicious guilt-less banana muffins. I just cant tell you enough how great this recipe is. Thank you thank you thank you

After reading other reviews, I decided to add extra apple, some cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla extract, and chopped walnuts to add some extra flavor. In addition, I used whole wheat flour and milk and low fat vanilla yogurt instead of buttermilk. I made mini muffins and they only needed about 10 minutes in a 440 degree oven.  They turned out really well! They're great little, healthy, and filling snacks. I will definitely be making these again!

With some adjustments this could be 'the best!'. Here's what I did. I grated a carrot added that to the recipe also I added a tablespoon of baking powder so it would puff up more instead of resembling a hockey puck. I terminated the sugar, I mean it no sugar and if you bake this try 15 minutes extra but if you don't try refrigerating over night so they don't become mush.  I used peaches instead of apples and a word to the wise when you cook with peaches peal them because in my muffins (I didn't peal them) there are strange occurances or spots that have a bluish, purplish nature. Not the most appetizing.

Love these muffins. To make it a bit healthier and to use what I had available, I replaced the buttermilk with 1 cup low fat yogurt. Also, if you are like me and like to avoid using eggs, I use egg replacer to equate the egg whites. I grated the apple with the skin. I added dates for more fiber. Love this recipe. Next time I'll add some spice.

A good alternative for health conscious snackers.  Enjoyed these with a cup of coffee. Although I forgot to add the egg whites these were still good. My 20mth daughter also eats these for snacks.

They are a little bland, even after adding a tsp. of vanilla and cinnamon. I used 1 whole egg instead of 2 egg whites. I also added raisins for some more sweetness.

These were incredibly moist and I know they are incredibly healthy. I threw in some frozen blueberries and that was a nice touch. Very nice for a quick breakfast. I loved mine with some jam.

Here's the trick to making them rise:  preheat to 350, turn to 400 when you put them in the oven, bake for 13-15 mins.  Good base recipe, here are my changes:  2 Tbsp ground flax seed, 1 T. vanilla extract, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/4 c. applesauce, 1 whole apple (I had gala apples on hand).

This muffin has great flavor and I'm impressed with the nutritional values.  I changed a few things, but the recipe was basically the same.  I substituted whole wheat flour and added 1 TBS of gluten, added 1/2 c applesauce, and 1/2 c orange-flavored Craisins instead of the grated apple.  They baked for 20 minutes, by mistake, and were still terrific. Not too sweet and a good texture. I also recommend not using the paper liners as the muffins did stick to them, but they came out cleanly from the foil liners.

These are a very good and healthy muffin.  I did take up some of the reviewers on some modifications.  I increased the brown sugar to about 1/3 cup and some cinnamon to add more sweetness. It was just right.I also added the other half of the apple by chopping it up and also added raisins, walnuts, pecans and about 1/4 cup of ground flax seeds.  These are now not only yummy but full of texture and super healthy!  They weren't dry at all, but don't overbake, if anything, check a few minutes before they are done.  Even with me making the muffins slightly larger (to yield 8 instead of 12) they should be baked at about 17 minutes.  Loved the suggestion to preheat the oven  at 500 first then lower to 350 when you put in the oven.  Great find! will make again!

I also didn't care for these.  Another reviewer said flavorless, I'd have to agree.  I tried to tweak the recipe here and there to make it better because I really wanted to make bran muffins, but alas, I just couldn't pull a good muffin out of this recipe if my life depended on it.  Granted, I'm a "foodie" and a little pudgy, LOL.  I'll keep looking, and I'm sorry for the poor review.  I honestly do appreciate your putting your recipe out there.

This recipe was really good for a base to any changes you want to make.  I subsituted 1/2 mashed bananna & 1 tsp oil for the oil & used the light version (with splenda) of brown sugar. I also added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts & cranraisins instead of the raisins. Was a big hit with the girls on my diet team.

These were very bland. Not much flavor. I did not add apples just applesauce. I am sorry these were just not for us. Maybe if you add a little sugar. Thanks anyway!

I'm not really impress about this recipe.  I has less taste than it suppose to be.  But I will try to make it again and more apple and some other fruits to give a flavor to it.

So today was the first time I made this muffins for a quick snack. They turned out awesome but I was shocked there was no seasonings in there... kinda gives health food a bad wrap by being bland. So I added cinnamon,a little extra brown sugar and swapped the wheat bran for oat bran. I highly recommend them as a healthy muffin alternative to the fatty ones.

I did make several changes to this recipe but I gave it a 5 because I felt it was a great base recipe.  I was looking for a low fat muffin and this one had simple instructions and minimal ingredients.  I didn't have wheat bran so I used Oatmeal, I also didn't have buttermilk, so I used vinegar and skim milk.  I added a whole apple and for extra flavour I also added a small applesauce, maybe 1/2 a cup.  I also read some other reviews I added some vanilla, some cinnamon, and some nutmeg.  They did have to to bake for the full 19 minutes because of the extra liquid, but turned out fabulous.  The are not sweet a lot but that didn't take away from them!

First time baking these muffins, and they came out great! Especially considering I changed a few things, I used skim milk instead of buttermilk (had to add some extra drops of milk to the bowl though) and added 1 tsp. of vanilla and 1 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon.  I love blueberries, so instead of using an apple, I added a few frozen blueberries to the tops of muffins once they were in the muffin pan.  I will definitely make these muffins again, very healthy and hearty tasting.  Next time w/ apple.  Very healthy and hearty

Delicious!  They are a little on the non-sweet side, so if you want to sweeten them up i would recommend some apple butter.  But I like them just fine plain

I hate to give this a bad review because I normally love bran muffins, but these were extremely bland, with an odd, wet texture and an unpleasant baking soda aftertaste. There are other bran muffins on allrecipes that are a lot better. Sorry.

These were quite good. I think anyone who says they didn't like them might not take them for what they are. Super simple and very low fat. You might not win any baking contests with this recipe but they are a yummy snack.   I threw in two pinches of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of vanilla and had no apples so used 1/4 C. of applesauce. I also sloshed in just a little extra buttermilk. Moist and tasty. I had two for breakfast and froze the rest. I will be making this recipe again. Thanks!

I really enjoyed theese muffins.  i added apple sauce instead of the grated apple and used 1 chopped apple also. I added 1/2c extra buttermilk because the mixture looked a little dry. The result was a moist enjoyable muffin.  My family was pleased and didn't know they were low fat.

Wouldn't make this recipe again. Although it was very healthy/low cholestrol, it lacked flavor even after I added extra sugar (splenda), applesauce, more chopped apple and a little cinnamon... a real disappointment. I made the "Classic Bran Muffins" recipe the week before with terrific results, so I recommend it before this one.
NOTE: If you like in a warm climate, you'll want to store it in the fridge. My went bad after 3 days left on the counter under a glass cake dome.

These were terrific with a few changes:
Used 1 tbsp. distilled vinegar in 1C of fat free milk in place of buttermilk (less calories and expense); used 1/2 C brown sugar (made them sweeter); used 1/2 C unsweetened applesauce in place of grated apple (made them more moist).  Great basic recipe!  Thanks!

These were great! I added some cinnamon and vanilla because I love the way they smell when baking, but they also help bring out the natural sweetness of the bran and apple (which I chopped instead of grated). I also sub.ed 1/2 cup of oats for 1/2 cup of the flour just for kicks. ;) Even my younger sister who turns up her nose to anything healthy loved them!

Great low fat muffins.  I made the following changes.  I added vanilla and cinnamon.  I chopped the apples instead of grating them.  I did not have buttermilk so I added a tablespoon of vinegar to 1 cup milk.  It is true as other reviewers wrote the muffins are not very sweet, but I felt that they were sweet enough for a breakfast muffin.  Thanks for sharing.

First time I dared to try bran muffins (let alone actually make them myself) and these are great! Moist and tasty - a nice change from the overly sweet, dry, non-bran quick mix kind you buy in a bag at the store.
I'll happily make these again! (And other people liked them too.)

good, healthy muffins. although they are a little dry. i chose to add 1tsp of cinnamon and had to add an extra 1/8 of milk because the mixture was very biscuit-like. would be good with maybe some honey on top or coconut in the recipe. thanks!

These were pretty good, but mine came out a little dry.  I used whole wheat flour, 1 1/2 tsp of baking soda, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 c. of diced apple, and 1/2 c. of all natural applesauce.  I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/3 c. of raisins.  The apple taste did get lost, but the raisins were a nice addition.  These muffins are GREAT for the added fiber.

Great recipe! They were very moist and flavorful. I have to admit, I did alter the recipe slightly after reading other reviews, but nothing too drastic. I increased the sugar (which I think was probably a good idea), added a little cinnamon, and I made a double batch of the recipe, so I used one cup all purpose flour, and one cup whole wheat flour. I froze most of them and have been bringing out a few to thaw each evening. They are great for breakfast and snacks during the day. And despite what one reviewer said, I would have no problem serving them to company. . . they look just fine.

For someone trying to eat healthier this was a very good recipe! I followed some reviewers' suggestions and added a little more sugar and apple and spices. I also used amasi instead of buttermilk (it's a lot cheaper) and it still turned out very well. I would add even more apple next time :)

Great starter recipe.  I did a blend of wheat germ, oat bran and wheat bran with regular milk.  I added some oats in place of some of the bran, but combined that with the dry ingredients.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white, and I added to that a tablespoon of flax meal and a tsp of cinnamon.  To the soaking bran mixture I added the egg whites, a tsp of vanilla, a quarter cup of raisins, a quarter cup of honey and a whole finely chopped red delicious apple.  I knew what texture to look for in the final product, so I wasn't worried about exacts.  They turned out moist and delicious!  Thanks Jenny. :)

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!. After reading some of the reviews I made some changes....substituted the buttermilk with fat free vanilla yogurt and fat free milk. I also added some raisins, cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla extract. The batter seemed a little thick so if you want to go this route you may want to add just a little over 1 cup of yogurt and watch your muffins because 16-18 minutes may be just a tad bit too long for them to stay in the oven. Will definately make this again!

No doubt that this is a very healthy muffin recipe, but I personally can use a little bit more sugar, and next time when I make this again, I will probably grate 1/2 apple, and dice 1/2 apple so I can still taste the apple in the muffine

These were deilcious, I add rasins because whats a bran muffin without raisins? I added by hand but about 1/2 cup maybe. Ive made 2 batches in 2 days and my whole family loves them, I added vanilla and apple pie spice to one, But i screwed up on cooking time, so they were a little rubbery, but the first batch was amazing Thanks!

These muffins are easy to prepare and using Weight Watchers e-tools "build a recipe" they come out to only 1 point.  I can't wait to modify the recipe using blackberries in place of the apples, or bananas or blueberries, etc.  These will definitely be a family favorite for a high fiber, low-fat snack.

I really enjoyed these muffins!  They make a quick and healthy breakfast on the go!  I made a few of my own updates to the recipe: I used cake flour instead of all purpose and beat the egg whites & folded them into the batter to help make the finished muffin less dense.  I also added 1 whole diced apple (instead of the grated apple), 1 tablespoon of maple syrup (to add a bit more sweetness), and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla.

I used two apples and added a tablespoon of Splenda, but they still aren't sweet enough for me. Even with all that extra apple they weren't as fruity as I would have liked. If I make these again I might try adding some banana.

I used a 1/2 cup brown sugar and changed the bran ratio to 1/2 cup bran to 1 1/2 cup flour.  I also added spices (all spice). I also used 2 whole eggs instead of egg whites.  Maybe a little less healthy, but I felt that the bran/flour ratio made the muffins a little too dense.

These didn't have a lot of flavor in them but I didn't expect any so I was quite pleased.As a low-fat snack these are quite good.The only problem for me was that they were stuck to the papers and it was inpossible to get them off.

Made these yesterday, they're ok for a low-fat low-cal snack but not nice enough to scoff the lot in one sitting - which is a good thing I suppose!

I added 2 tbsp  splenda to the mix in response to previous reviews that said these muffins weren't very sweet, however I found this made them way too sweet so will leave that out next time.

I add a fair bit of cinnamon when I make these and also cut the apple up into small pieces instead, the grated apple seems to get 'lost' in the mixture.  I make these every week and they always turn out well.  My mother even asked for the recipe and makes them herself now :)

I don't know what I did wrong but these didn't rise at all for me.  I also found them a little bland even though I added cinnamon and nutmeg.  Next time, I would definately add raisins too.

This recipe is great to have on hand because it's healthy -- I'm a former muffin/bagel addict, but when I started cutting calories I had to give my many of my breakfast favorites up.  They're not pretty for guests or anything, but they're a great source of fiber, taste pretty darn good and store well/moist in a ziplock for over a week.  I put raisins and cinnamon in mine, too, to give it a little more flavor.

Excellent!  My boyfriend ate all of them and has been asking for more ever since!  I used applesauce because I had it on hand, and light cream because the supermarket seemed to be out of buttermilk.  I sprinkled some brown sugar on the top too.  Great recipe!

Love these muffins, followed the advise to add the cinnamon and vanilla.  Preheating the oven to 500 degrees was something I had never heard of so I do so. Then reduced, the heat to 350 degrees.  The muffins came out beautifully.  I have worked to nearly eliminate sugar from my diet so these muffins have plenty of sweetness for us.

These turned out more moist than other muffin recipes I’ve made.  They had nice flavor.  I added raisins.

I made the recipe as written. These muffins are a little bland, but a good snack when looking for something healthy. Next time I will add more apple and cinnamon or vanilla for flavor.

These are nice! But like bran muffins are a bit bland. I would add raisins or blueberries next time for a little more flavour. I would make these again. I used half whole wheat flour and half almond flour. Still tastes fine

Decent nutrition for a muffin! Added 1 tsp of cinnamon, used a Granny Smith apple, and used Kellogg's All-Bran Complete cereal. I did the math according to my ingredients (per muffin): 92 calories, 18g carbs (7g sugar), 1g fat, 3g protein, 1g fiber. If pure wheat bran ( i.e., Bob's Red Mill unprocessed) is used, fiber per muffin is 3g, sugar down to 6g. Enjoy!

Soft and substantial! If you want to cut out the refined sugar you can do what I did, substitute sugar for apple concentrate and pure date syrup. Yummy!

As another reviewer has stated, you need to refrigerate these or they will go sour after 3 days or so. We liked the flavor and texture until they went south.
