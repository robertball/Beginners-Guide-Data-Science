As written, this chili is four stars.  Very good, but missing something.  I added a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic and about a teaspoon of salt.  We topped our bowls off with cilantro and lime wedges and ate it with warm corn tortillas.  Delish!!  PAM cooking spray made clean-up super easy!  We'll have this again several times throughout the upcoming cold winter months!

This was such an easy recipe to get together and full of flavor! I added one diced fresh jalapeno and one clove of garlic to the chili. I grilled the chicken and added it to the soup the last 30 minutes of cooking instead of cooking it in the soup because I started it a little late in the day.  The grilled chicken actually gave it a nice smokey taste.  I will definitely be making this again.

I followed the cooking tips and drained 1 can of beans so I could have a nice thick chicken chili to stick on top of some tortillas. This was a great, warm, comforting meal!

Love this recipe. Made it twice in two weeks! The second time, I pureed the one can of beans with an immersion blender and that gave the chili a nice thick texture and I added about 1-2 tsp of chili powder as well. Great recipe.

My husband really enjoyed this chili recipe. It is so easy to make and has great flavor. Spraying Pam on the crockpot insert does help keep the ingredients from sticking.

I'm like one reviewer who stated that something was missing. I realized it's too watery and the cumin-which I like-over powered the taste so I added a tsp of truffle sea salt and that corn starch base...I forget what it's called but you add a few tablespoons of corn starch and water and pour it in the soup. Also 2 cans of beans isn't enough. Depending on how many will eat this 3 cans should be enough.

Excellent recipe! Really the only thing I changed was using chicken breasts because we aren't big fans of dark meat. Yum-o!

Loved this recipe. Best sponsored recipe I have come across. I doubled the amount of seasoning the recipe calls for and added few dashes of Cayenne Pepper as well. I only had one can of white beans so used light red kidney beans as my second can. Was very pleased with this white chili and will make it again.

Yummy...I used fajita chicken meat and Schwan's roasted bell peppers and onions...Also, added 1/2 jalapeno and extra chili pepper (we like a kick)...In the last 1/2 hour, I added frozen corn kernels and shredded cheese.  I also used the idea of one of the other responders and added minced garlic instead of powder....Added to crumbled tortilla chips...very good.!!  Put some in small containers to take to work for lunch and froze those.

I love this! I was a rebel and changed things up a little due to lack of pre-planning. I wanted this for dinner and had forgotten to prep ahead for the slow cooker before I left for work so I converted to a stove top method. I lightly sprayed the bottom of a stainless steel pot with Pam cooking spray before adding diced chicken thighs and onions. While the Pam worked in the pot it would be best to use an oil and save the Pam for the slow cooker method. I sauteed the onion and chicken for about 5 minutes to brown up the chicken a bit before adding the rest of the ingredients as directed, simmering for about 30 -45 minutes. I topped with sour cream.  A simple delicious meal I plan on making again whether prepared in a slow cooker or on the stovetop.

Great recipe! I did make a couple of changes to add my touches and family preferences. My chicken thighs were frozen, so I defrosted them in some water, saving the water to use as my chicken broth. Also, I seasoned my cut up pile of chicken thighs with garlic salt & pepper to get that seasoning going before adding to crock pot.  After chopping my onion, I added it to the reserved chicken broth and microwaved it a couple of minutes to get it started. I added chicken bouillon, poultry seasoning and green chilies.  About an hour before cook time is up, I taste and adjust salt, pepper and other seasonings.

This recipe to me was mediocre. I cooked it exactly according to the instructions but it came out bland. I ended up adding several different things in the end to give it more flavor. I also can't stand behind it being called Chili. To me, chili is much thicker and filling. This was more like a chicken stew or soup.

I grilled the chicken to add a depth of flavor to this creamy white chili. Let it simmer in your slow cooker for a meal that your family will love! I recommend using Mexican oregano. The RO*TEL diced tomatoes and green chilies are the perfect ingredient for this chili.

I've made this many times. Definitely drain the beans (both cans) for a thicker chili. I've done it WITHOUT chicken too before for a cheaper option - still amazing. Definitely add garlic powder.

Not really what I would call "chili" - it's very watery.  More like a soup really.  But yes - definitely missing something. Maybe drain the beans and add another can of chilis?

This was good but as written it does come out very watery and more like a soup. I even drained one of the cans of beans. I had to thicken it up a little with a flour water mixture.  I did add some minced garlic and salt and pepper for extra flavor. Overall yummy but next time i will drain everything first.

Prepared as written.  And as another review stated I pumped mine up with a few cloves of fresh minced garlic, plus added a  pinch of dill, and chili powder, some fresh cilantro and about a half cup shredded mexi cheese. Thickened with cornstarch. Served with sliced avocado tortillas, cilantro garnish and topped with more shredded cheese and sour cream.

Cooked on the conventional stovetop. Used chicken breast, instead of thighs.  Used dried great northern beans cooked on the stovetop. Added a bay leaf and 2 tsp of dried cilantro. Tasty

We ate this with a little cheese and sour cream on top. It was delicious, but I would pass on the chicken stock the next time. It was very soupy. I also doubled it and drained the second can of tomatoes.

It is a great simple recipe. And if you like a mild chili it is absolutely wonderful. However, I love spicy! Added 1/4 cup chili powder and some diced jalapeños. Drained beans because I wanted it thicker. The next day I poured out over egg noodles. Awesome!

I agree with others, this is rather bland but easy to fix.  Pump up the spices/seasonings and eliminate some of the liquid for a traditional chili not soup.  Quick and easy, great way to use chicken thighs.

Exceptionally simple and delicious.  Cannelloni beans used.  Took advice of another and added 2 cloves garlic.  Topped with shredded Pepper Jack, chopped Cilantro, lime wedge and served with white corn tortilla chips.  You won't be disappointed.

Made it for the first time and took to work for a lunch.  Was worried since I had never tried it.  But, it was great and a big hit.  I doubled the recipe to have enough.  I also used the whole chicken, actually two whole chickens as everything was doubled.

I thought the recipe was good but not great.  Part of my family liked it, some didn't.  I have another recipe I usually use so it might be they are just used to something different when I say we are having white chicken chili.  I loved how easy it was to clean my crock pot after spraying with PAM and how the meal smelled when I walked in from work.

i followed other reviews and added fresh jalapeño and garlic. I also used chicken breast instead of thighs. I used homemade chicken broth so that may have affected the flavors but the soup tasted good. When serving I added crumbled up tortilla chips to my soup and it gave it the thickened constancy I was wanting. I would make this again but would add some masa as an thicker.

I really loved the simplicity of this recipe! It took zero effort to put together with such Delicious results! I did use boneless chicken breast and realized I only had 1 can of the white beans so i added a can of chili beans as well! It was a definite hit for dinner tonight!

I'm giving this a 5, even though I only slightly tweaked it by adding more beans, some celery and 2 cloves of garlic.  Chili is really a dish that should reflect your own personal tastes, but this is a solid recipe to start with.  Mashing the beans in the slow cooker before adding the rest of the ingredients is genius!

My husband couldn't get enough of it.  He told me it was all he could do to stay out of the crockpot until I got home from work!  Now THAT's a compliment!  I did, however, check my seasonings and wound up adding in more cumin, salt, and some green chilies.  That really jazzed up the flavor!   I also served it with a small dollop of sour cream on top just to add in a bit of creaminess.

This chili was very flavorful. I had to add a jalapeno and a couple cloves of garlic and that really added that zip of heat that we like in our chili. Using PAM made clean up a breeze, too. Easy and a great recipe. I did drain the one can of chili beans and glad I did or it would have been too soupy. It made my whole house smell good. Plus it was even better for lunch the next day.
