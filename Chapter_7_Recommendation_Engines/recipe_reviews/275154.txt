I didn’t have ricotta, or the cookies so substituted cream cheese and crushed oatmeal honey granola bars and graham cracker crumbs. The crumb mix gave this dessert a not too sweet crunchy layer and topping. Really light and creamy dessert. My first-time guest and I both agreed, though, that the creamy cheese mixture was too sweet. The recipe doesn’t need both honey and icing sugar in those quantities, especially if the berries are sweet. My guest initially asked if it was ice cream because it was so creamy. I’d definitely make this again but will reduce the icing sugar or possibly just use honey. Will also try with other fresh fruit, like mango, and perhaps add some unsweetened flaked coconut to the crumb layer & topping!??
