This is the real thing.  Parchment paper is a must here.  I've tried adding a teaspoon of almond extract for a change with great sucess.  I like to refrigerate the dough for a couple of hours which results in a much rounder macaroon that can be dipped in chocolate.

The ease of making these decadent cookies belies how wonderful they are: Blue Ribbon Winner for sure! My husband, who likes coconut only in very small doses and only toasted, could not stop eating them. I found that the recipe yielded 18 cookies that were larger than golf balls and that took the full 15 minutes to bake. Also, a 14-ounce package of coconut equaled the 5 1/2 cups. Perfect! Thanks for sharing.

This is a great easy recipe. I used a Matfer silicon pad on my cookie sheet which eliminated any sticking and burning. Athough the recipe doesn't specify it, I HIGHLY suggest using sweetened coconut. Also, I subsituted one of the tsps of vanilla extract for almond extract, which worked great. I definitely suggest mixing the extract(s) into the condensed milk before adding to the coconut mix - that way you are sure the flavor is evenly distributed throughout the dough. Molding the cookies was a quite a sticky process, so I just dipped a couple of fingers in a little bit of water as I patted down the dough so that I could get the cookies into a solid shape and still be able to get them onto the cookie sheet in one piece. As an aside, I have made chocolate macaroons before by adding a square (or two) of melted unsweetened bakers chocolate to the condensed milk mix, and I am sure that would work for this recipe as well. Or you could try pressing a maraschino cherry into the top of each cookie - it makes for a very classy presentation - people love it!

Gift Idea:   Shape coconut into small tablespoon-sized ovals/rectangles, then bake.  Drizzle thin strips of chocolate, or dip cookie in chocolate.  After cooling, slip into cupcake liners and stack inside plastic, festive "treat bags" & tie with ribbon.

I followed the recipe exactly as written, and am not at all disappointed.  I did use sweetened flake coconut, since that was what I had in the house -- but I think that was the intent here, anyway. I also refrigerated the dough for a couple of hours before scooping it out (didn't intend to, just had to stop for a kid emergency). These turned out great. Didn't stick to the parchment. Were great warm from the oven, and almost better the 2nd day.  The only thing I think I'll change next time is to bake them a little longer (as others have suggested) to bring out more of the toasted flavor.

We have a tradition of always making these macaroons at Christmas. They're really great! We use 1 t. vanilla and 1 t. almond extract as others have suggested. Also, mixing the extracts and condensed milk first and then adding it to the coconut mixture makes the whole process much easier. Third, make sure to use parchment on your cookie sheets. Finally, top with red or green  candied cherry halves to make them more festive. The taste is fantastic and they look great on your cookie plates!

After many trials and errors for the perfect macaroon, this is it! I have had more compliments on these cookies. I do melt about 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips with 1 teaspoon of shortening and then drizzle them over the cookie using a plastic zip-type storage bag with the corner cut off. Very, very impressive. They store very well, also.

I have never made Coconut Macaroons before so I made 2 different recipes: This one and the one in a Betty Crocker recipe book.  There was quite a bit of difference in texture and taste.  This recipe was good, but not great.  It was hard on the outside and chewy within.  The taste did taste a lot like the sweetened condensed milk.  The Betty Crocker recipe called for whipped egg whites and other goodies and was just better all the way around.  It browned really nice and tasted unbelievable...so, sorry this one is just okay.

This is a wonderful Macaroon! I used 1 and 1/2 tsp. of vanilla and 1/2 tsp. of almond extract. 
reduced the oven temp to 325 and made the cookies a little smaller and baked for 15-17 minutes. I got 30 cookies out of it. Used a small cookie scoop. Yummmmmmmmy! Can't wait to share them with the ladies at work. This is one of the better recipes I have stumbled upon. Easy too!

VERY IMPORTANT!

Some modifications to the procedure to this recipe:

1) Once you've scooped your dough onto your parchment paper that has been lightly sprayed with cooking oil, flatten the tops of them with a dampened finger.  ALSO, go around the base of the cookie and try to press in any piece of coconut on the parchment that may sticking out.  These errant pieces can burn more easily.

2) Bake the cookies at 300F for about 20-25 minutes, until golden brown.  At 350F, it is extremely easy to burn these cookies.  The gentle cooking temperature affords you the luxury of having them achieve a rich, golden color while still maintaining moist, chewy macaroons.

Great recipe.  Should have discovered this years ago.  Have had a few proposals from this one. I make a chocolate dip (3 Squares Choc bark and 1/2 cup semisweet choc chips, melted in micro) dip the bottoms in the chocolate and set aside to cool

Delicious! My first batch I use a recipe calling for egg whites which turned out flat and "eggy" tasting.  However this batch turned out perfect!!   I added an additional1 1/2 tsp almond extract and also 1/2 cup chopped almonds. Definitely mix the sweetened condensed milk with the extracts first.  Make sure that your coconut is tightly packed when measuring and then mix it all up in the food processor. The food processor cuts the coconut a little finer, but not much, and makes clean-up a sinch!  Refrigerate your dough for 1-2 hours to get it really cold.    When you shape your dough balls, make sure that your hands are wet with cold water.  You will need to rinse your hands about every 4-5 balls; you'll know when the dough sticks to your hands and you can no longer shape the balls.  My cookies are about 1/2 golf ball size.    Cook @ 325 for about 15-18 minutes and then let cook completely on the cookie sheet before moving. Otherwise they will fall apart.   When cooled, drizzle with melted chocolate chips.

Great, simple recipe. I found these needed a bit more than 15 min to get that nice toasty look. Used coconut extract in addition to vanilla for extra coconut flavor. Definitely use parchment to avoid having them stick and spray your hands with Pam to make shaping them easier! They don't spread, so that shape you roll them is the shape they'll end up. Waited till they cooled and dipped the bottoms in chocolate - half semi-sweet, half white, and placed on wax paper. Deeelish. P.S. - I just tried them, and I realized why you want them golf-ball size: so the outside gets toasty but the inside stays chewy. The smaller ones I made are a little tougher. If you want smaller ones, maybe up the temp so they don't get so cooked in the middle? I like them small because they're soooooo rich!

After reading comments about the strong taste of the condensed milk, I tweaked mine a little before trying recipe out. I did not add vanilla at all, but I did add 1 tsp. of almond extract. I only used 1/2 a can of condensed milk, and replaced the other 1/2 with cream of coconut (the stuff used for pina colada's). The cream of coconut bumped up the coconut flavor nicely, and they came out perfect.

These are delicious and so easy!  I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract.  After baking and cooling I dipped the bottoms in melted dark chocolate.  This recipe made 20 cookies that held their shape and were larger than golf balls.  My only problem is figuring out the perfect baking time, as I live at high altitude.  The coconut on the tops toasted in just 10 minutes, so I took them out  but later felt that they could have used a little more time in the middle.  So next time I may lower the temperature to 325 and bake for 15-18 minutes.  Okay, adding on to my previous review:  I've made them again and baked at 325 for 15 minutes, then turned the oven off and left them in for another 5 minutes.  It was perfect.

These are wonderful! They are my new Christmas cookie--so easy to make dozens at a time, and everyone loves them (even me, and I don't really like coconut!). 

The trick to getting these off the pan is to grease and then FLOUR the pan. They fall right off--no parchment paper, foil or special liner necessary.

Over the years, I've tried, over and over, to successfully make maccaroons, as my husband loves coconut. I made these golf-ball sized, baked them at the recommended temp., but 3 min. before time was up, I turned the oven off, put a wooden spoon in the door to let the heat out slowly. After 15 min., I removed them from the oven, completely golden brown and done completely through without drying them out. Success at last.

OMG, these cookies are soooo good and sooo easy to make.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added about 1/2 tsp. of almond extract in addition to the vanilla.  I mixed the extracts with the condensed milk before adding to the coconut mixture. Wetting your hands with cold water before shaping the cookies helps keep the sticky batter from sticking to your hands. (a 14oz pkg coconut = 51/2 cups) After the cookies cooled, I drizzled them with semi-sweet chocolate. (put about 1 cup of chips in a qt. freezer bag and microwave for about 90 sec.- "squishing" chips after every 30 sec.- until melted- then snip a very small corner out of bag and drizzle over cookies.) The whole house smelled like toasted coconut. Oh, I also sprayed the foil with Pam with flour before placing my cookies on it- they came off very easy. I will never make another coconut macaroon recipe.

The recipe did not specify what kind of coconut, so I opted for unsweetened.  I used Bob's Red Mill Fine Macaroon Coconut.  I made golf ball-sized cookies with a medium cookie scoop.  I had to bake for a total of 25 minutes as they did not appear done at 15.  These came out perfect and were very easy to make.  There was absolutely no sticking to the parchment paper.  Thank you for such an easy, wonderful recipe!

These are very simple to make. I tried this recipe as well as the one off the Baker's coconut package which called for sugar instead of the sweetened condensed milk. I prefered the Baker's recipe, I think the milk tends to leave and aftertaste. But still a tasty recipe.

Easy to make, positively addicting and lends itself to variety...what more do you want in a cookie recipe? I made a batch for Easter, exactly as written, and am very pleased. I made several as thumbprint cookies, filling some with small, speckled jellybeans (really cute, like bird nests) and others with seedless raspberry preserves. Some I left as mounds and drizzled with melted semi-sweet chocolate chips. I used parchment paper and had no problems with sticking. Keeping the fingers wet while working with the dough is a must.

These were my first macaroons and I think they will be the only ones to make from now on. OMG, they were the quickest thing ever! They taste wonderful. I used 1tsp vanilla and 1tsp Amaretto. chilled dough for 30 min (had to clean the oven before I could use it) ;)  Made small scoops,placed on parchment paper and cooked towards top of oven for full 15 min. I added mini semisweet choc chips to half batch. After cooling, I melted bowls of white choc. and dark choc. and dunked the bottom 1/2 in choc. and sat on wax paper till set. Crispy/Chewy/Moist!! I will fill tins and give as Christmas gifts. will try different extracts for cool combos like : lime juice/coconut, Pineapple/coconut, almond/dk choc, rum/coconut crm, orange/dk choc  Thanks for a great, simple recipe!!

I used to make the recipe on the back of the coconut package. Not anymore!!! These are grrreat! I took some semi-sweet chocolate chips melted them down and added a little vanilla and some sea salt to the top off these yummy cookies. Next year for x-mas I will be making a double batch.

These were delicious and very easy to make.  I drizzled chocolate over them to make them pretty.  I did not have condensed milk (I thought I did, but I had 2 cans of evaporated) so I went online to find a substitute.  I am so glad I did!!  YUM!  Here's a sub for condensed milk (and it worked wonderfully, I don't think I'll buy condensed milk again)	 2 eggs 1 c. brown sugar 1 tsp. vanilla 2 tbsp. flour 1/2 tsp. baking powder 1/4 tsp. salt Mix all ingredients and use as a substitute for sweetened condensed milk.

I made these using sweetened coconut and with a little almond extract in addition to the vanilla, as suggested by other reviewers. I also made them tiny to fill bags for gifts (about 1 tsp each) and dipped the bottoms in dark chocolate. I got 99 out of the recipe. These macaroons are really quite good- chewy and sweet. They are very simple to make and also quite frugal (a batch cost me about $4). They baked up really quick (the little ones took maybe 8-10 min at 325). I suggest letting them cool on the pan for a few min before removing them, as it makes them stick a lot less. I used a Silpat liner and still had gunk on it when I was done. Don't skip lining the pan! Anyways, I would highly recommend the recipe and I'm sure it's one I will use again in the future.

to avoid the stick that some people ran into I just sprayed the parchment...they slid off no problem. My 2nd batch i cooked them on 325 for a bit longer and got a prettier toast. I would recommend that.  I got 13 much bigger than golf ball macaroons too.  Tasty and chewy!!

I tried this recipe. Undoubtably I have done something terribly wrong here. The recipe turned out awful. No one could eat the macaroons.
 It has great reviews and TNT reviews. I don't understand what could have happen since the recipe is so simple. Any help on this recipe would be appreciated.
 Thanks,
  Gina

Had some fresh coconut on hand and looked for some recipes-- this is a winner-- I added a little more flour and baking powder- since I like it a little lighter and fluffier. I also used unsweetened condensed milk and added just a bit of sugar since the coconut is sweet enough.
My final verdict: Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside--- It's a keeper, I can see why you won the blue ribbon on this one!
Thanks Kristi

To make it easier for my young girls to help me, I dumped the coconut mixture into a gallon ziploc bag. Then I added the condensed milk to the bag. After pressing out the air, the girls "stirred" the mixture with their hands by mashing and rolling the bag around our island. Good fun and Great cookies! 

I also took the advice of others and added 1/2 cup sliced almonds, 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips, and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract. Delicious.

OMG! I decided to make these after I realized I had 5 bags of flaked coconut stashed in the pantry! The recipe definitely makes more than 12. Maybe 12 tennis ball sized! I will follow the advice of several reviewers of chilling them for several hours then dipping in chocolate. Can't wait! Delish!

These cookies were so easy to make.  I followed some prior suggestions and used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract...next time I'll still use the almond but I'll use MORE vanilla.  I got more than 3 dozen cookies from this recipe, but my cookies were smaller than ping pong ball shape.  I didn't have any problem with sticking, I used baking spray right on my regular old cookie sheets and they slid right off when they were done.  Chilling the batter prior to forming the cookies is a MUST.  And they are sticky buggers.  I didn't like the look of the cookies after I dipped my fingers in water and rolled them, I prefer the way they look with dry fingers (you get more coconut flyaways that get crispy and pretty).  I also prefer these cookies to be flatter.  I squished them down before baking.  Oh!  These don't spread out AT ALL so pack 'em tight on your cookie sheet to save time.  Some other reviewers were right about the sweetened condensed milk taste right out of the oven, it's very prominent, but the next morning, that taste mellowed out and the coconut taste enhanced!  I also melted semisweet chocolate (with a dollop of shortening) to drizzle on top.  I live at a high altitude so I reduced the temp to 325, and baked for 18 minutes.  It seemed like each batch wanted a little bit longer to get perfect.  P:  These cookies were so easy, they really do look professional, and they are TASTEY!

Not a good macaroon recipe at all. I followed the recipe exactly and the macaroons were not fluffy. When placed in the hot oven they began to melt. The macaroons were flat and the sugar mixture was like a half inch ring around them. I really gave them a chance and tasted them, no good comments at all. Taste was not good either.

Chewy.  Delicious.  Thanks to my daughter for finding & making this recipe, we enjoyed these after our SuperBowl dinner.  They could not have been more perfect in eye appeal and taste!  This is her second batch in 2 days.  Golf ball size made 2 dz. macaroons!  Cooking time was twice the recommended in both ovens.  Matters not, but I had to hide them from myself this morning.  Just seeing them is irresistible.
TIP:  Rolling the dough in your hands to make a ball makes it dense.  Dropping from a cookie scoop gives the more spread out and flaky appearance of the attached picture.  I love that browned coconut!

These are fantastic.  I always do 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp almond extract.  I've dipped in chocolate or left them plain.  People like them both ways.

They were a hit!  "These are suspiciously simple to make...", I thought to myself as I made them.  Maybe it was the lack of ingredients, since I'm used to a laundry list for the contents of anything I bake ever! But I digress... This really is the best macaroon recipe!  I got lotsa compliments on them, and I recommend trying it!

This is an excellent recipe as is, however, if you want to take it a notch higher, add some drops of Lori Anns natural candy oil in coconut. I added about 8 highly concentrated drops to the mixture and it tastes even better. It is still light, but a little more flavor.

I have made coconut macaroons many times before and am bummed that I decided to try this recipe.  The flour makes the middle of the cookie almost doughy and gives it a strange flavor.  Usually you would use egg whites as a binding agent instead and I will never vary from that again.

These macaroons were a hit at my house! They took about 5 minutes to prepare and not much longer to bake. The taste was just what i was looking for. The was barely anything that i changed from the original recipe. One thing i changed was waiting for them to cool, then dipping the very bottom in melted chocolate before chilling in the refrigerator. The chocolate added a nice accent flavor. Also, don't wait for all of the coconut on the outside to brown, if you just wait for some of it to brown, the inside is a nice texture. I will defiantly make them again soon, except a double batch instead!

This is a very easy recipe.   I'm not sure if it made it made a difference but I used almond flour intead.  I used plastic gloves making it less messy.  I also made them smaller than golf balls.

Very good. Mine seemed to dry out a little faster than usual and they were kept in a tight fitting container. I dipped them in dark chocolate on the bottom, next time I'm going to coat the whole macaroon in chocolate.

Yummy.  Sweet, chewy and EASY.  I did not have parchment so I baked the straight on the pan.  Got them off pretty quick and on to a cooling rack- no problem.

Excellent! Rave reviews all around! 

One important issue - it says that this recipe yields 12 servings so I decided to double the recipe to make 24 macaroons. Instead I got ONE HUNDRED. That is a lot of macaroons! So if you follow the recipe for one dozen be prepared for a lot more than 12.   

Also, if you're old fashioned like I am and you stir by hand, it's quite hard work to get it all together in the beginning but it's worth the work.   

Definitely blend the vanilla to the condensed milk before adding it to the dry ingredients. 

I coated the sticky balls with additional coconut (rolled them in more coconut) before baking which helped them to keep their shape.

A silicone baking sheet works brilliantly for this type of baking. No sticking whatsoever. 

Delicious - and plentiful!

I didnt give it a full 5 stars since I altered the recipe a bit. I added 1.5 teaspoon of vanilla and 2/3 teaspoon of almond extract and also added some almonds to the mixture as well. After I dipped them halfway in dark chocolate. YUM!!!

Delicious!   4 stars only because it's so simple.  This batch is earmarked for a soldier in Afghanistan.

These were a nice little treat and surprisingly easy to make.  My dad loves coconut so I made them for his birthday using shredded coconut I had left over from making carrot cake.  I used a little less sweetened condensed milk than called for since I used sweetened coconut and my dad doesn't like things too sugary.  I also added a tiny bit of almond extract for deeper flavor.  It is kind of hard to tell when they are done; I left them in for the full 15 minutes and they were perfect, nice and chewy but not hard.  I used the tablespoon measurer to scoop them which worked really well.  Thanks for this great recipe!

They are pretty good.  Not sure about the 12 servings.  I got 2 dozen pretty large cookies out of this.  I think I'll make them smaller the next time.

I but candied cherries in half and pressed into the middle of each cookie and they were excellent! Best Macaroon recipe ever!

The sweetened condensed milk told me this was the super sweet and yummy treat I was looking for and I was NOT disappointed!  I did as another reviewer and refrigerated them before putting them on a baking sheet I had sprayed with butter flavored oil. Worked like a charm. First macaroons for grand kids and they loved them.  Many thanks for another great recipe!

The nicest compliment you can receive is having people ask for "your" recipe! These were such a hit! The first time I made them I wanted them quite small for a reception. Made 5 dozen, baked at 325 for 13 min. Next time I made them, I got 4 dozen, but didn't change a thing... same 325 for 13 min. Even better! Took others' advice and combined the sweetened milk and vanilla before mixing, and refrigerated for at least an hour before placing on baking sheets. This recipe is a keeper!! Thanks Kristil.

I didn't think I liked macaroons, but when visiting a French Bakery on Long Island, I sampled some great ones that I wanted to replicate as soon as I returned home to Michigan. Achieved 1st-class results with this recipe. Thank you.

This was my first time making coconut macaroons (or any macaroons, really) and they turned out great!  I used 1 tsp. vanilla extract and 1 tsp. almond extract, per other reviewers suggestions.  I love the flavor, but can definitely taste the almond extract; someone who doesn't like the almond flavor should probably use less, or just stick with the vanilla.  I could also taste the salt just a bit, but that worked for me because I love the salty/sweet combination.  I can't wait to bring these to my family Christmas party this weekend!  I'm sure they'll be a hit.

This is a good recipe, I took the advice from others and did 1 teaspoon of Almond and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract instead of just the vanilla, this worked well.(I mixed the extracts in a bowl with the condensed milk before adding to coconut and flour.) I omitted the salt.  Also I double panned 2 cookie sheets to make sure the bottom of my cookies didn't brown to much, instead of tinfoil I used my Tupperware silicone mat and the macaroons slid right off!!   I dipped the macaroons in chocolate, they came out gourmet and look too good to eat!!

I think this is an absolutely wonderful Southern style macaroon. I prefer the chewy texture over an egg white style. I think it's a matter of preference. I added 4 tbs of real maple syrup and 1 tsp of butter extract.... I added the condensed milk(warmed in hot water), flour, salt, syrup, and butter extract to my food processor and pulsed until blended. Then I added my coconut and pulsed until just mixed.I poured it into a freezer bag and let sit overnight in the refrigerator. When I was ready to cook I  just snipped off a corner a squeezed quarter sized cookies onto my parchment. I wouldn't use anything on the parchment because they will spread. I had no problem with them sticking and I used the same piece of parchment for three pans full. If I were to caution anything it would be to be careful with the flour. A little less is okay (in the food processor anyway) Wait on your review until you have tasted these cookies the next day... They get better overnight!

QUICK & EASY!  This was my first time making macaroons and I was amazed at how quick and easy they were to do.  I used a bag of coconut that was marked 5 1/3 cups feeling that was close enough.   I baked them a little longer turning the temperature down after 15 minutes so they wouldn't burn.  We were delighted with the taste and texture.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.  It would make a great treat for any occasion.  Thank you FRATCOOK for sharing!

Not a gourmet cookie recipe.  Followed recipe with the exception of extra egg whites, whipped.  Glad I added them too, as the cookies have a tendency to leak and burn around edges.  The end result tasted just like coconut dumped in a can of condensed milk.  If I could do it over, I would have chopped the coconut in food processor and then toasted it.  I think it would have had better flavor and not left such an awful aftertaste.  I really don't recommend this recipe.

Made according to the recipe. I think my ice cream scoop is too big as the flavor is good, but not enough toasted flavor. I'm going to try again but make them smaller.

I didn't put any salt in my cookies and I used raw, dried coconut.  It was still just as moist and delicious but healthier.

These were easy, quick and absolutely delicious. I followed it exactly as it was, which is rare. I think next time like some others mentioned I will try adding slivered almonds or and almond extract (maybe even amaretto) instead of vanilla. I think I just found a new go-to recipe

Delicious! I used a 400g bag of sweetened coconut and a 200g bag of unsweetened coconut. I mixed the vanilla with the condensed milk prior to adding to the coconut mix. I used a regular spoon to scoop out little portions and I came out with over 50! They weren't hard-packed, which could be the reason why. I baked on parchment paper lined cookie sheets for about 10 mins. I made sure I kept an eye out for browning because oily foods tend to brown fast. I think if you like coconut, you will LOVE these macaroons! Would be great to include in Christmas baking because they look like little snowballs!

These coconut macaroons are so simple, yet so sinfully tasty. Fresh out of the oven, they are crispy and warm, almost pastry-like. After a few days, they are gooey and sweet, like candy. Next time, I will add a bit more flour hoping to cut down on some of the stickyness. A 1 oz. scoop is a must.

These are wonderful Macaroons.I did what some of the others did and used 1 teaspoon almond with the vanilla.I dipped the bottoms in chocolate and then drizzled it over the tops.They are soooo good.I used my tablespoon measuring spoon as a scoop.I sprayed it with pam so the dough would not stick in the spoon.The Tbls makes a good size cookie and it makes a lot of cookies.My whole family loves them.Thanks so much for such a simple and great recipe.

Followed the directions exactly as is!! Baked mine for 15 minutes. Might use half sweetened and unsweetened coconut next time, because it was a bit too sweet for me, but that's just a preference. Very good recipe!! Great dipped in dark chocolate.

Maybe my idea of Coconut Macaroons are different than everyone else's, I cooked them exactly as directed. They tasted like pure evaporated milk. I've been eating these for years and have never experienced a dense texture or flavor like this before! Was embarrased to hand them out at my cookie exchange, even dipped them in chocolate to hide the tast. No thank you.

Yum!  I made the mistake originally of not greasing my foil.  The cookies stuck... bad.  However, once they cooled on the foil, it was much much easier to pull them off.  I've also made adult versions using spiced rum, cocunut rum, amaretto, or vanilla liqueur (Tuaca) as substitutions for the vanilla extract.  

One thing that made my mixing easier.  Mix all dry in separate bowl from the wet.  Adding flavoring to the milk first and then adding the mixture to the dry ingredients made for a consistent flavor.

And my FAVORITE substitution?? Adding just a few splashes of lime juice to the macaroons (key lime if you can find it, but be careful... it can overpower).  Then I dipped half the cookie in white chocolate.  Raves at parties!

These were fantastic. I used sweetened coconut to heighten the flavor. It worked well. I did find that they stuck to the foil, so I let them sit for a couple of minutes, then pulled them off without a problem. I also dipped the bottom of each cookie in melted chocolate. Decadent!

I made this recipe for myself and my roommates...they didn't even last a day!  Very delicious recipe.  I melted some semi-sweet chocolate chips in the microwave and drizzled it onto the macaroons before baking.  They came out wonderful!

I think these would be better with almond flavoring. We thought they were VERY bland for our tastes. I guess my family just prefers the egg white type macaroons. I used a small scoop and got 4 dozen. I also put a half of a candied cherry on top of each cookie. They look festive that way. They look pretty on a platter of Christmas cookies. Too bad they taste so blah! Frankly, I just can't imagine how they win prizes at state fairs. Everyone who tried them, just said they were "Okay," but not great. I will not make these again, that is for sure!

Not at all what I expected.  I took the advise of another reviewer and added 1/2 tsp of almond extract.  Big mistake!  It totally covered up the coconut flavor.  Maybe try coconut extract instead?  They didnt bake very well for me either.  I cooked  them as the recipe sugested and the little peices of coconut that stuck out got a little too cooked.  I hoped they would be a little more like the ones you can get at the bakery.  Will not make these again.

these cookies kicked be-hind!! try this recipe, you won't be disapointed! it was easy & inexpensive to make. mixed pretty well, but next time i would try mixing the condensed milk & vanilla together before adding it to the rest of the batter. my husband requested these bad boys, and i know that he'll love them!! i didn't use the tin foil, i greased the cookie sheets very heavily & it worked ok. when you take them out of the oven, quickly remove them while there still hot, it makes it stick less....i'm in coconut heaven..

Loved this cookie, I think the added flour may have been the answer to some problems with the other recipe's I reviewed.  One of the best, and yet quick, easy, and impossible to fail.

Amazing...so they said. I do not even like coconut but was so bored and had all ingredients so decided to make for those who enjoy coconut. They LOVED them!!! Thank you for such an easy recipe. I cooked mine a bit longer but followed exactly otherwise. Cant wait to make for the holidays. Perfect

Super easy. Word of caution: 5.5 cups of coconut = 2 14 oz bags, NOT 64 ounces (which is what I originally thought since I converted cups to ounces). They were quite good, but super sweet. However, since they are so easy, I will use this as my go-to. Thanks for a great recipe!

Not sure what happened, I didn't care for this. Way too much coconut, and nothing like any macaroon I have ever had. I'm not saving this one.

My first experience with making macaroons and it was a success! I had to bake them longer for the coconut to toast. I also learned that if I moisten my hands with water, they are *much* easier to shape into balls (without all of the batter sticking to my fingers)! I made nine BIG macaroons, I am sure that's why the bake time needed to be longer, too. I dipped about half into melted chocolate- those are my favorite! My husband prefers the plain. Either way, they are great and this recipe is a keeper :)

These are wonderful. After mixing the dough I put it in the freezer for 30 min so that the dough is easier to form into balls. They are SO GOOD ! ! !

My family loved these. They are great as as written. I have made them with maraschino cherries and dizzled chocolate on top. Or if you love almond joy candy, I drizzeled chocolate and toasted almonds on top.

USE TIN FOIL!!!! The first 2 batches I did on the paper and they burnt to the paper each time, even after I tried lowering the heat. The next batch I did on the tin foil, being fed up with trying to salvage them, and voila! They turned out all pretty and even without sticking.

First time attempting to make macaroons was a bit of a failure. I kept burning the bottoms!! I used cookie sheets wrapped with aluminum foil, but it  failed for both batches I made!  The top part, however, was toasted to perfection and my entire family kept picking at them. I personally found them to be incredibly sweet and perhaps a little heavy on the condensed milk. Then again, this was my first time making them...anyone who is planning to make these, don't forget to dip them in milk/white chocolate!

I'm not a big fan of coconut but for some reason I had a craving for these today.  They are wonderful!!!  I followed the recipe to a T.  I did cook them a bit longer to get that golden color.  About 18 minutes.  They are very soft when you take them out of the oven so don't worry if you think their not cooked enough...they harden a bit once the cool down.

Ok, I first gave these five stars when eating them hot out of oven, but now that it's cooled off, taking away 2 stars! Like every says, the condensed milk is tooo overpowering plus it cools off and becomes this stone-hard ball. I thought I just had to use less flour and bake a bit longer, but now I know, it's the condense milk! I will stick to the eggwhite formulas for a more fluffy and more coconut taste.

Very chewy and delicious! We had bought organic coconut flakes and didn't realize they were not sweetened. On our second try, we used powdered (unsweetened) coconut (instead of flakes) which made them more doughy and workable and also added a little sugar and this time they came out much better. Thanks for sharing!

These taste great, and oh so easy to make.  I lined my baking sheet with parchment paper, which worked out well.  After the macaroons cooled, I dipped the tops in white and milk chocolate and sprinkled with colored sugar.  Very pretty on a cookie tray.

Easy to make, great taste, and doesn't take much time at all.  Parchment paper is a must.  I do think next time I'll make them a bit smaller.  They came out huge!   You can't go wrong with this simple and tasty recipe.

I followed the recipe as stated, didn't change a thing. I got 15 cookies out of my batch. Used a regular ice cream scoop. These were delicious and sinful and extremely rich. Great if you love coconut, like I do!

I decided to make these for DH because he loves coconut. I had a horrible time with this one, but not really for fault of the recipe. It was certainly simple to mix up, but then the trouble started. :( First the parchment paper managed to catch fire in the oven, set off the fire alarms and filled the house with smoke, and the cookies completely stuck to the paper, resulting in paper-bottomed cookies. Then the chocolate glaze I'd decided to dip them in turned grainy for some reason and refused to set up. After going into the bedroom and having a good 8-month-pregnancy induced emotional breakdown, I promptly returned and ate 5 of them. Overall, they are quick and easy to make and taste good, but lacking in some flavor -- maybe almond extract would be a good addition? Also, since they won't spread, I think it would be good to flatten them a bit and not leave them as rounded golf balls on the tray so the middles will cook more. After all this, DH was nice enough to tell me they taste good, but not outstanding, so no need to make them again since there are many others things that I make that are much better.

These really are delicious macaroons, but they are a little too gooey and chewy for my tastes. I love coconut, but I'm searching for a recipe that produces a lighter more cake-like macaroon(if that makes sense) that I have had from bakeries. I dipped some of these in milk and semi-sweet chocolate, both were very good. I did chill the dough about an hour before scooping out on the parchment paper. You could easily mold these with your hands for a more uniform shape, which is what I did. I made the first batch as written and the second batch I used half vanilla extract and half almond, I prefer the additon of the almond extract. If your looking for a true classic macaroon recipe, this is it. Thanks for sharing :)

They were very good, but tended to lose their shape in the oven and got a bit burnt on top where the coconut stuck out. The next time I am going to grind the coconut up and see if that creates a more uniform and evenly browned macaroon.

I did as the others suggested and put the mixture in the fridge for a half hour.  Also, added the green and red holiday cherries to the top (cut them in 1/2 horizontally).  These are just like I remember growing up!  Very addictive!

Delicious and simple. I suggest using two different sizes of coconut for added texture. Mix the two together and make the ball, then roll it in the larger size before you oven it. I also threw some almonds in, they complimented the flavor well.

I have made this recipe several times.  The first time I made it I thought it was too salty.  The other times I have cut the salt in half and it is way better.  Other than the salt it is a great recipe.

Awesome!  Just awesome!  I was hesitate to try a macaroon thinking they would come out too dry.  Not the case!  These are so yummy; just like popping a small piece of coconut cream pie into your mouth.  I used a small cookie scoop and it made 55 cookies.  Baked them for 12 minutes.  While I loved eating them straight from the oven, they are still fresh and chewy 2 days later.

Sorry, I did not enjoy these at all. The taste of condensed milk in these was obnoxious and overwhelming. I would recommend the macaroon recipes that call for egg whites instead. The Farm Macaroons recipe from this site, on the other hand, is going to be a holiday staple for me from now on.

EXCELLENT and tasty. Only change I made was to place them in mini-muffin pans to bake with a piece of pecan on top for looks.  That way they are browned all over and easier than scraping off a foil lined cookie sheet.

I made these as suggested, then dipped them in Chocolate Almond Bark & inserted an almond into the center....just like the popular candy sold in stores - actually I think mine are better because the coconut is slightly cruntchy & toasted. Yummy!

OH MY! So this is what I did. I doubled the amount from "12" to "24" but I wanted more so I thought about what I could do to add more bulk and here's what I did: I used my 1-oz cookie scoop and filled it halfway. THEN, I added 1 (unwrapped) Hershey's Kiss, then filled the scoop the rest of the way. I changed nothing of the original ingredients (but the amount.) These are so good, chewy and sweet and easy to make. So my final yield was 57 cookies. I am bringing them to work and I hope that they like them as much as I do. Thank you for this recipe, I will be making them often. OH! I almost forgot, I cooked them on cookie sheets lined with the non-stick foil and they all came off. UPDATE-- My coworkers LOVED them!

I make a similar recipe but decided to try these. They're good but not as good as the one I got from my mother. These were a bit dry and hard to work with, whereas if you omit the flour altogether you get easy to handle drop cookie dough and it's SUCCULENT and gooey to perfection.

Excellent recipe. Not sure why others had trouble. I placed all ingredients EXCEPT coconut into my electric mixer (with paddle attachment) and mixed on medium for about 2 minutes, had the appearance of smooth cake frosting. With mixer on low, add the bag of coconut. (My 14oz bag of coconut clearly indicated it was = 5 1/3 cups, so don't bother measuring). Optionally, add miniature chocolate chips or chopped nuts. I used aluminum foil with cooking spray. Bake until the edges just begin to brown (about 12-15 minutes).  When cookies were cool, there were easily removed. Receipe as shown yielded about 30 cookies. I use a teaspon to take dough from bowl and then use a tablespoon to place it onto the cookie sheet. Works well with any dough that tends to be sticky and you get more evenly sized cookies that bake more uniformly.

Super easy. Super rich, Super STICKY (until cooled). I was not super impressed. Yes, they're good. My husband was happier with them than I was. Good news: I got nearly 5 dozen (each batch) normal-sized cookies from the two batches I made. I cannot imagine eating one of these the size of a golf ball. They are very rich, and too candy-like for me. I preferred the chocolate version I made over the regular (added 3tbsp cocoa). Oh and I also added the almond extract, as so many advised. I am going to have to make the old recipe I have to confirm it, but I am pretty sure I will stay with that one (I got that off of the Mounds coconut bag). 
So, I guess, Blue Ribbons or not, they are no the recipe I have been searching for, alas.

I have to say that this recipe was much better than the Barefoot Contessa recipe I tried!

I made 2 separate batches of these, one with almond extract and one without, and personally I liked the one without better. I also found that I didn't even need to use parchment paper if I just greased the cookie sheet really well. My other advice would be not to use a stoneware cookie sheet, they tend to take longer to cook, and don't brown as nicely in my opinion. 

I drizzled chocolate on top for some added fancy since it is the holidays, and I rolled the batter into little balls (much smaller than a golf ball) and then pressed my thumb in the middle. It made the perfect little bite size cookie! 

Overall I am really happy with this recipe and definitely would make these again and again! Plus, they were a HUGE hit with my family...there weren't any left and no one could stay away from them!

Delish!  I added half a candied cherry to each macaroon.  Lined the baking tray with parchment paper and they all came right off.  They did take closer to 15-20mins to cook at 175C.  Only complaint is that the recipe yeild was for 12 macaroons and I finished with 24, good size ones too! I'll cut the recipe in half next time.

Awesome & easy recipe!  I made them for Valentine's Day and used 1 t. almond extract & 1 t. vanilla extract.  I also used a fork to toss the coconut, salt, and flour together before adding the mixture of sweet milk and extracts.  Use a small cookie/ice cream scoop ~ no sticky hands.  My boyfriend ate 6 right out of the oven.  I think the flavor/texture improved after sitting over night (if you can keep from eating them that is...).  I dipped some in chocolate too!  Yummy!!!  Thanks, Kristil!

very good cookies! i just generously greased my baking sheets and took the cookies off the sheets immediately after i took them out of the oven. no problems with sticking or anything! i also used 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla and then 1/4 of almond extract (i only had 1/4 left in my bottle...) and this turned out really well.  then i dipped half in melted chocolate chips and half regular and brought some to a party..everybody loved them! they're delicious...must try these!

This is the BEST recipe for macaroons. Every time I make these someone wants the recipe.  They come out perfect every time. I use the large scoop from pampered chef and it makes 18 macaroons.

I followed the directions to a t and they spread out all over the paper. They also tasted sort of bleah... More like condensed milk than anything else.

These are very easy to make! A little sticky to form. Dont bake these too long, or they aren't as soft! (duh!) I drizzled chocolate on top of mine! I also flattened with a bottom of a cup before baking. These are ok, very rich. (i baked mine a couple mins too long)

I've never made macaroons before and these turned out great!  I couldn't believe how easy they were to make! I read all the reviews of all the other recipes, and this one seemed most impressive to me!  Dipped 'em in chocolate, took them to a social event, and they were a HUGE hit!  Thank you!

I found these to be so-so, but my husband loved them, and they were scarfed up at our church pot luck.  They stuck to the aluminum foil pretty badly for me and found that I had to remove them quickly in order to get them off at all.  I didn't try parchment paper; hopefully that works better.

Unbelievably simply to prepare from start to finish with minimal ingredients. Yet the finish product is beyond amazing, it's a flavor explosion in your mouth. Subtly sweet and overwhelmingly addictive.

Delicious and easy recipe! I have an aunt who can't tolerate gluten so I substituted coconut flour when taking them to a family function and they were just as delicious as when I made them with regular flour. Since they are already a coconut based dessert, the substitution was undetectable. Definitely recommended if you're looking for a gluten free dessert that doesn't sacrifice flavor or texture.

These taste pretty good but perhaps a bit plain for me.  I do have a process tip though: first combine the liquid ingredients and the flour to make a smooth paste.  Only then should you add the coconut.  This will let you simply focus on coating the coconut rather than trying to mix everything at once.

Easiest and most delicious coconut macaroons I've ever made! Condensed milk is super sweet to begin with, so make sure to use unsweetened coconut flakes (or unsweetened shredded coconut).
To make these even better, drizzle some melted dark chocolate over the baked and cooled macaroons. so yummy!

Easiest recipe ever!! And one of my favorites! My friends all LOVE when I make these. There's no way to screw up since there's no whipped egg whites involved or leavener involved. The thing that annoys me though, is the smoke that comes pouring out of the oven once it's done. It's oil from the coconut shreds, which can't be helped, but be warned. I also thought it would come out waaay too sweet, but it was perfect!

These are delicious and so easy! I followed the recipe exactly, but instead made them bite size by using a round teaspoon to drop them on the tray. I refrigerated the dough for an hour or so first and kept a mug of cold water close to dip my fingers in. No stickiness issues and I lined my trays with parchment and the cookies did not stick at all. I lowered the temp to 325 to make sure they cooked through and took them out when the outsides were golden. I also melted a cup of semi-sweet chips and a tablespoon of shortening in a zipper freezer bag(quart size) in the microwave at 50% power for 40 second intervals, kneading in between until fully melted. Snip a corner off the bag and drizzle over the tops for really beautiful macaroons. Thanks for the recipe!

I like to play with my recipes so try this - you might like it:
use this same recipe but switch out the regular condensed milk for the Eagle Brand Dolce le Leche (caramel flavour), and add a caramel square in the center....my family and co workers can't get enough!

Who knew making macaroons could be this easy?  These were good, but I made the mistake of taking suggestions from other reviewers and baked my first batch at 300 degrees and it took forever to toast the coconut and I may have dried them out slightly.  The second batch I baked at 325, which turned out a bit better.  But next time I will actually follow the recipe and bake these at 350.

Excellent and easy! Mine took longer to cook to get toasted, about 22 minutes. Used an ice cream scoop to mold them after chilling as er other reviews and I got 25 cookies out of this recipe.

Oh my stars... This was simply wonderful! My only complaint is I had to adjust the temp- I didn't get the beautiful golden brown look I was hoping for, but every oven is different.  I drizzled chocolate and placed an almond on top for an almond joy! And oh, how joyful these things are! Thanks for sharing!

These were just OK.  I think I will look for a recipe that has eggs in it.  I made this per the recipe.  The first batch in the oven burned on the bottom before the top was toasted.  I turned the oven temp down to 300 degrees and cooked for 13-15 minutes.  They were browned perfectly.

These cookies are good, but the lightness of a macaroon I am used to is missing.  I drizzled a little dark chocolate over them for fun, the kids liked them even more after that.

WOW! These were so good!!!  I had never made macaroons before and the store was out, so I figured I'd give this recipe a try.  Definitely a keeper.  I did cook them about 17-18 minutes to allow for toasting of the coconut.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

My husband who prides himself a "macaroon conniseur" said they were the best macaroons he's ever had.  I can't believe how easy they were to make!  I used fat free sweetened condensed milk and 1 teaspoon each of vanilla and almond extract.  I used my mini scooper  to make (approx) golf ball sized cookies and baked them for about 20 min.  These are going to become a regular in my family.

Yummy, easy to make with just a few ingredients!!
I used 1/2 teaspoon almond extract and 1-1/2 vanilla. I used my small cookie scoop (a heaping measuring tablespoon) and baked them for 8-9 minutes, depending on the cookie sheet (one of mine browns faster than the other.) I got 33 perfect cookies ~ probably would have been 34, I think I ate enough of the cookie dough to equal a cookie!! :) They don't spread out, so you could kind of crowd them on the cookie sheet. I didn't use parchment paper, just sprayed my sheets with canola spray, they didn't stick at all. Quick and easy.

This was my first attempt with Macaroons.  I added about a tbls. coconut flour to the flour and a 1/2 teas. almond flavoring. I tried not to handle the cookie too much so it won't be tough.  It is a rich cookie!!

Absolutely amazing (and normally I don't even LIKE coconut!).  I'm slow to review this, but have been using this recipe for years now.. Everyone always wants the recipe, nobody can believe how easy it is.  Absolutely a keeper!

AWESOME :)  I chopped the coconut a bit finer in my food processor, mixed well with a big spoon.  (my hands got ReAllY sticky when I tried to use them to mix) used almond extract instead of vanilla.  I used the bigger side of my melon baller to shape them and dropped on aluminum foil sprayed with Pam and they didnt stick a bit during baking.  My daughter melted chocolate chips, put them in a baggie with a tiny corner cut off and drizzled the tops.  They were easy to make and very rewarding! Definatly making this part of our Christmas Cookie Tradition!!

At first, I was somewhat disappointed with this recipe.  I waited until the cookies were completely cooled, and I ate half of the batch!!  These cookies are very simple to make, and very DELICIOUS !  The only reason why I'm not giving this recipe 5 stars, is because I'm not completely happy with the texture.  The next time I make these, I will pulse 1/2 of the coconut in the food processor to make the texture more to my liking.  I will definitely be making this 1 again.

This was the first time I ever made macaroons. Although I found it messy, it was super easy. I followed the directions to a T. Baked for 15 on nonstick foil. They came out perfect!

I used wax paper and the bottom were stuck to it and I couldnt get the cookies off without tearing the paper an leaving bits of wax paper on the bottom. I then just used a generous portion of cooking spray on the cookie sheet and they slid off beautifully.  If you are going to use foil, use the non-stick foil you can now buy. Other than that they were very easy and taste great!

These are pretty good. I used a chipped coconut I find in a health food store in WA. Make sure you spray the parchment with non-stick spray, otherwise your macaroons will stick to the paper which makes it very hard to remove. I will make these again.

I followed this recipe exactly, and these are terrible tasting macaroons. 

Like others said, it tastes exactly like condensed milk. The macaroon is way too dense (flour is unnecessary in a macaroon) and gloppy. Like another reviewer I glazed it in chocolate to hide the taste.

Right after, I made traditional egg-based, flourless macaroons (no condensed milk) and they tasted amazing.

These are just ok, they are more like a gooey coconut blob than an actual cookie.

Update: Everyone else who has tried them LOVES them. So I upped them to a 4.

So easy and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly but had to bake them for 25 minutes to get them golden and toasty. I made half of them flat (used a fork to flatten). They made a prettier presentation when I dipped one side in chocolate. The rest I made into the traditional mound shape but without chocolate. Got raves from the family. Stayed moist and chewy.

This is the best coconut macaroon cookie I have ever tasted and it is so simple and quick! I have found that this recipe makes closer to 18 cookies than a dozen and that they sometimes take up to 20 minutes to bake. I highly recommend using parchment paper, having done it both ways.

Excellent recipe!  These were a big hit with the friends I shared with on Valentine's Day... Chewy and delicious.  I almost always use parchment paper when baking, and these popped right off.  No mess clean-up!  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe... this one's definitely a keeper!  :)

Incredible, a simple basic recipe one that you can change according to your taste. My son is sensitive to wheat so I used a gluten free flour and they came out like a charm. Thank you.

I followed the recipe.  Then when half was left, I added Chocolate chips and almonds.  They definitely needed something more.  I also dipped some of them in chocolate.  Those were the best.  My kids didn't like them though.

Super sweet.  The thinner the cookie the better for this recipe if made as is.

This  is the kind of recipe I've been looking for. It's going in my christmas cookie file. Take the other reviewers advice and use parchment paper, I used foil and they were somewhat burndt on the bottom buy still edible. I also shredded the coconut which made about 30 cookies.

I'd never had a coconut macaroon before, but the recipe seemed simple enough and had great ratings. Followed the recipe exactly and while they were very easy to make, they also seemed very bland to me. Maybe they aren't supposed to be very rich.. ? Also, the texture was a little odd. Sort of crunchy chewy on the outside but sticky gooey on the inside. I don't think it's a bad recipe, just not one that suits my tastes.

I just took first batch out..I made them way smaller than recipe says- and have 30 macaroons. They look and taste great. I kept  batter in fridge for 2 hrs..easier to work with. I don't know why some are having problems with sticking to the parchment. If you refrigerate them they are way easier to work with. I added 1 cup of slivered almonds. I will drizzle dark chocolate and give as a gift tomorrow. This is a very easy recipe..Thanks to 'Fratcook'!

i have never tried coconut macaroons before but i love coconut so i decided to try them. they are very simple and they taste very simple also. don't take that the wrong way i truly mean that as a compliment. i think anything with coconut in it coconut should be the star. i added 1/2 teaspoon almond extract on top of the vanilla. if you spray the ice cream scoop with cooking spray and keep wetting your fingers in between each one then it will be a breeze. i work at a restaurant as the in house baker and we do gift baskets and i have a lot of requests for these. thanks for the recipe.

These are FABULOUS!  I'm not sure they will make it til Christmas and I will probably have to make more!!!  I must say that I did add some potato flakes to them (for a traditional flair) & to thicken up the dough a bit.  After they cooled I also dipped the bottoms into Chocolate Almond Bark.  Very Pretty, Very Yummy....this one's a keeper!

I wanted to try a new cookie for this Christmas.  I always like to add a new recipe, so long as they come out good.  Well, this recipe was very easy.  I liked their appearance and was very pleased with the taste.  I added a teaspoon of Almond extract which was GREAT!  I used an ice cream scooper sprayed with pam to make my macaroons.   Of course I had to play around with them as I made them, but all in all it was not difficult.  I made them smaller therefore I had about doubled the cookies.  I will add them to the Christmas cookie list.

This is a really good - and simple - macaroon recipe. It takes no time to whip them up and bake them. I added a little almond extract the last time I made them and it added a nice touch. I am also planning to make another batch and dip them in a little bit of chocolate on one side.  It states that the recipe makes 12 cookies. I found that those are large cookies. I like to make smaller cookies. I usually get about 20 smaller cookies out of this recipe.

This is a great recipe, nice and basic. You have to use parchment paper, otherwise these will stick to everything! I made two batches, one with 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract, the almond stood out too much. The second batch I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp coconut which was great, a nice smooth coconut taste with nothing to take away or add to the flavor. I suggest that you use more coconut. The taste was great but the ratio of wet to dry is a little off, so I suggest you add a little more coconut to make them nice and full.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and cooked them longer than stated- about 24 minutes- b/c it took that long for them to look a little browned.  Not sure if they were overcooked or what but they were just ok.  I drizzeled them with melted chocolate and they look cool but the flavor was average.  I doubt I will make these again.

Wow! So simple yet so delicious! I love them plain or dipped in chocolate. I did add 1/2 tsp almond extract and was very pleased with the result, but just vanilla is good too. I let the dough chill for an hour before i scooped it with a cookie scoop into walnut sized balls onto parchment paper. Smooth out the stray coconut because it will get too brown or even burn. BTW, my husband who doesn't even like coconut liked these macaroons!

This recipe is great. However, maybe I left them in the oven a bit too long, they were alittle hard the next day.  The flavor was still amazing, I also put 1 tbs of vanilla and 1 tbs of almond extract. Good flavor. I did toast the coconut alittle before mixing. Also, mixing the liquids together before also helped. It is a sticky process. I used aluminum foil and I let them cool and I had no problem with them sticking to it...

Only had evaporated milk so I made my own condensed. 1 cup evaporated milk, add 1 1/4 c. sugar. Heat until sugar melted. Slightly toasted some of the coconut on stovetop so I would have a nice color. Cooking time was longer. About 20 minutes. Recipe turned out fantastic.

Couldn't quite get them "perfect".  Each batch was either over-done or under-done, but they were STILL delicious.  Will definately try these again and again until I figure out how to get them just right.  Quick and easy recipe.

This is an easy recipe and turns out perfect every time.  May I suggest toasting the coconut a bit before using. Also, I make a double batch and freeze ready rolled ones to pop into the oven when I want some.  Drizzle a bit of chocolate on them and you are good to go.

Outstanding! I made these when I had a partial can of sweetened condensed milk to use up. Just scale the recipe back for the amount of milk you have and there you go. I have two sizes of ice cream scoops, so I made cookies in both sizes. I prefer the smaller, which is a little smaller than golf ball size.

Very tasty macaroons. The only thing I changed was the size of the cookie. An ice cream scoop is much to large. I used regular heaping teaspoon. They were great!

I had NO idea delicious macaroons were sooo easy!!  I did add an extra tsp. vanilla and used 3/4 of the sweetened condensed milk, as it is pretty rich-my husband loves them and he doesn't like things with sweetened coconut...go figure!

Perfect recipe.  Couldn't be easier.  Better than any store bought macaroon I've ever had.  I drizzled mine with chocolate (check out my photo).  My only tip is keep an eye on the cooking time.  I found that it wasnt enough, and about 16 minutes got them a nice color.   I noticed alot of the photos posted look a little pale.  I think a macaroon should be nice and golden.   Also, dont be afraid to make them big and to to keep them tight (just dont overpack a ton).   But keeping them big will let them be more fluffy rather than chewy.  I like it either way.   And I melted dark chocolate and drizzled it using two chopsticks shaking very quickly.  Give it a nice FINE drizzle and it will look professional and taste delicious.

i used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract.  The cans of condensed milk that i bought are a different volume then the one in the recipe - remember to check the ml.  It was very easy to prepare and yummy!

I can certainly see why these are prize winning cookies!!! So simple and absolutely scrumptious!!! I made a batch for a family member who has just returned from hospital, and brought some to work where they recived a huge thumbs up. I made these just as written and the flavor was great...I may try a dash of almond extract as suggested by other reviewers. I was tempted to add some chocolate to the tops, but they were oh so good as is, I decided against it. I cooked mine on parchment paper, for ease. I also sprayed my scooper with a touch of non-stick spray. I think these would ship well, if packed in a tin, and will be added to my list of treats for holiday gift giving. I am so glad I tried this recipe...it is a real keeper!

This review may be unfair because there are so many different ways of making these cookies.  The condensed milk gave this cookie a strange texture.  I prefer the Baker's recipe.

I've been looking forever for a non crispy coconut macaroon like they sell at grocery stores!  I'm so happy with this recipe.

this is a great recipe, however it has the potential make a BIG STICKY MESS IF.... trust me use parchment paper, chill it before you start dipping in a cookie scooper, and put the paper on a cooling rack and cool completely before putting them on a display plate or bowl. trust me :) Use sweetened coconut and sweetened fat free condensed milk. (coconut and condensed milk actually have ALOT of saturated fat, and these ARE habit-forming:) also if simple is your kinda thing vanilla is fine, if not add more extracts. Also, for best taste use a freshly opened bag of coconut (not the remnants in fridge from a previous recipe, like I did, it does make a difference :).

The best........oh, mix the vanilla into the condensed milk, then stir in the flour, then add the coconut and mix well.  It is evently distributed this way.

Outstanding recipe even after forgetting to add the vanilla, but otherwise followed exactly!  Try dipping in dark chocolate on the bottom and then into sliced toasted almonds!  Looks and tastes great! So very good fresh after baking and still tasted good the next day but not as good as out of the oven.  Thanks for the recipe!

I baked the first batch 15-16 minutes based on others saying they would bake theirs longer in the future for a more toasted exterior. All that really seemed to do was make a thicker shell layer over the outside. I baked the others for 13 minutes and the insides were the same either way, but the exterior bite was much nicer with the shorter time. Maybe if you want toasted, you could roll them in lightly toasted coconut that would toast fully in the oven? Also, I chilled my batter for a bit and sprayed my hands before rolling the dough into golf ball-sized balls. They ended up looking like the ones in the picture currently featured, (3 with 2 raspberries in case it changes) so if you want yours to look like that, that is how to get it done. :) They are super sweet - so i also dipped the bottoms of mine in semi-sweet chocolate to cut it a bit. These remind me of mounds bar filling, and probably would be awesome dipped completely in dark chocolate!  FOR THOSE HAVING TROUBLE WITH REMOVING THEM... let them cool a bit first and they might just come off clean. Mine did. I was over-eager and went for them right away and only one wanted to come away with out feeling like it would tear to shreds. Some cookies just need a minute. :)

I had to cook these for over 20 minutes for them to get them even slighly golden.  Wasn't thrilled with the stickiness of the cookie either.  Not the best macaroons, and I wouldn't make again.

This was a fantastic recipe! I made 15 dozen and each one came out perfect!! I have two tips: Use some oil spray (PAM) on your hands while rolling the balls so they don't stick. This will last about 5 or so balls. Also, I used Reynolds 'Release' foil and the cookies came right off. I needed to adjust my baking time to about 20 minutes, not sure why. I just kept an eye on the. They are soo yummy! Chewy on the inside!!! mmmm!!!!

I consider myself a good cook and I love coconut but I could not stomach these! Maybe it's just personal preference.  The sweetened condensed milk flavor was overpowering and sickenly sweet.

As FRATCOOK states, these ARE very simple to make! ~and delicious. I thought my husband was going to lose it right there... He didn't stop mmm-ing and ummmm-ing until he was through the second one and forced himself away from eating the whole plate. Said they were the best Macaroons he's ever had.. and his mother used to make them for him all the time. Mission accomplished!! ;) I made them as is.. baked until coconut was nice and toasty looking and then melted some chips and butter flavored crisco in microwave (30 seconds at a time then stir) and drizzled the chocolate with a spoon... I keep mine in the fridge cause I like them better cold. Can't go wrong with this recipe .. guaranteed!

These just didn't taste good.  I followed directions, chilled the dough.  The baked up perfectly, nice shape, nice color, nice texture, but didn't taste good.  I took to a party where people jumped on them, but not one person said, yummy, great or anything.  I noticed a lot of half eaten cookies on everyone's plate.  I did some in chocolate, and my husband thought that helped.  I guess 5 stars for presentation, 2 stars for flavor - and I did use 1tsp of the almond and 1 tsp of vanilla.

This recipe is great its sooo easy to make! I had a Luau recently with a ton of left over bags of coconut found this recipe glad i did i love simple yet yummy recipes. I used everyones suggestion about popping the unbaked cookies in the fridge for a couple of hours and i also added 1 tsp of Coconut extract and just used 1 tsp of Vanilla extract. So buttery and rich tasting. Very good.

My batter yielded 17 cookies. I decorated them with green maraschino cherries, and they looked good. However, I baked these for my mom's birthday, and they tasted so much like the sweetened condensed milk that I went to the bakery to buy real macaroons. I gave her the bakery cookies, but I decided to keep this recipe of cookies around, and I will say that they are getting better now that they are on their third day. Keep that in mind if you make these; the longer they sit, the better they get.

This recipe is phenomenal.  I made them for a family dinner party, and you would have thought I walked on water.  My mother, the calorie-counter, workoutaholic, actually ate 5 in one sitting.  AWESOME!  I was able to get 22 cookies out of the recipe, and I chose to refrigerate the dough for an hour to improve the consistency.  Easy, decadent, and delicious!

These are great. Especially the next day. I doubled the recipe and got 3 dozen larger than golf ball cookies. From this site I used the Satiny chocolate glaze to drizzle over them and that made them perfect. Improved the appearance and the chocolate was just what they needed. I had to spray the foil with cooking spray after my first batch stuck horribly. After that no problems. And don't leave too much coconut out on the edges of the cookies because it gets very brown and too hard.

Ok, I was a little nervous to make these based on the varied reviews.  These are great!  Easy to make and perfect result.  Definately double or triple the recipe.  I mixed both almond and vanilla extract (don't leave out the almond).  Mix the extract into the condensed milk for sure.  Bake 325 for 19 min.  You cannot go wrong. My family loves macroons and these are the best!!

While these taste ok, they are way too heavy and somewhat sticky to be macaroons. Condensed milk is not a good substitute for eggs/sugar.

This is one of my favorite treats! I served it with glazed cherries on top. After baking the macaroons I broiled them for a minute to brown the top, but i left them for a few seconds too long, so they dried up a bit. Other than that very tasty and extremely simple to make. Next time I will try to make them as cookies and use apricot jam to glue 2 cookies together, on their flat side.

excellent recipe. I used my baking stone and it didn't stick at all (without parchment or greasing).  As suggested by a previous posting, I let the dough chill for a couple hours, and that really did help make a better shape.

Yummy, sweet - but not too sweet and just the right texture.  A keeper.

I sprinkled the tops of mine with colored sugar before baking for Christmas.

I used an air-bake cookie pan, so the danger of burning was small.  I took the suggestion of greasing and flouring; that worked well.  Dipping the fingers in water when forming the cookies was a good idea too.  I cooked them a little longer and at 345, and I also made them smaller so that more of the coconut area would brown.

I made these for a reception and everyone said these tasted like a dulce de leche macaroon (I'm guessing because of the sweetened condensed milk). Next time I make these I will add a little rum for more of a dulce de leche twist. Very tasty, somewhat addictive - baker beware :-)

Wonderful! Moist cookies, perfect for entertaining. I melted chocolate and placed small spoonfuls onto wax paper and pressed the cookies into it. Then I drizzled chocolate over the tops.

Two words:  YUM-MY!  These were perfectly chewy!  I made the following changes, based in part on the reviews:  Used only 4 cups of coconut, added 1 1/2 cups rice krispies.  Mixed this with the flour and salt.  In separate bowl, mixed sweetened condensed milk with vanilla.  Then, combined all together and used fingers to mix, as recipe suggested (seems like more fun that way)!  Dipped fingers in cold water and mixture did not stick when I formed them into golf-ball sized bites.  Placed on foil lined cookie sheet sprayed with non-stick spray.  Baked at 325 for approximately 16-17 minutes.  Result:  chewy macaroons with slight cripiness baked in.  This recipe resulted in 3 dozen cookies!  One of the easiest cookie recipes to make and tastes like I spent a long time on them!

I have made these twice once using parchment paper and the other using foil. Both times the macaroons stuck horribly! I dont know what I am doing wrong. To salvalge them I dipped the bottoms in melted chocolate and no one ever knew I had to scrap them off of the foil. I have been asked to make them for Christmas and a church function so I assume that they are yummy... so alas, here I go again to scrape the macaroons off of the foil and dip them in chocolate!

I made this & meringue cookies for my hubby's birthday.  I normally don't like coconut macaroons, but these were pretty good.  My package of coconut flakes only came with 4 1/2 cups, so I added 1 cup mini semisweet chocolate chips.  I think that actually helped keep it from being too sweet.  After the first batch, I decided not to use my hands (hate the sticky mess).  I used two spoons to make loose balls.  I dipped my fingers in cold water (to keep them from sticking) & lightly patted the balls.  My husband loved the cookies, and I have to admit they're a little dangerous for me, too!

These macaroons were good, but I expected a little better according to the reviews. I used parchment paper and stonewear pans to bake at 325 degrees (I have a convection oven) for 17 mins.  They were very nicely cooked, not brown at all and came off pan beautifully.I used 1 teas. of vanilla 1 teas. of almond like some suggested but the almond was just too overpowering so next time I will use 1 1/2 teas. of vanilla and 1/4 teas. of almond and maybe I can rate it a five!

I was very disappointed in this recipe!  They were not very sweet at all and had an odd texture to them--not chewy at all, almost like a hard chunk of coconut.

I was kind of dissapointed with this recipe. I am getting closer to finding the perfect recipe though. They were very salty. Next time, I will eliminate the salt completely. I think that I will take the advice of others and use almond extract- and grease the baking sheets very well. I used wax paper- and there was no way I could get them off of the paper. I had to throw the whole batch away. There is hope though... with a few adjustments. Thank you for the base!

These macaroons are WONDERFUL if - and only if -you use sweetened coconut.

Since the recipe didn't specify sweetened coconut, I used regular coconut, and all I could taste was flour - yuck!    Once I figured it out, however, I couldn't be more pleased.

Oh, and these couldn't be easier - or quicker...

Five star cookie, 2 1/2 star recipe!

Great and super easy - my macaroons always used to crumble. The addition of the flour really helps! Next time, I'll dip these in some melted chocolate to make them even yummier!

These are the best! So easy! I tried another recipe that didn't call for flour and they ran all over the pan. These ones came out perfect. I also liked them with 1 tsp. almond extract and 1tsp. vanilla. I also made these quite a bit smaller- I got over 4 dozen little macaroons and only baked them for 10 minutes.

My husband, the coconut freak, loved these.  I doubled the recipe, halved the size of the cookie to about 1" globs and cooked for just as long. It made about 4 dozen.  The end result is a macaroon minus the cakey portion that some turn out to have.  We enjoyed the sweet flavor.

I love this recipe!  I used butter flavored crisco on my cookie sheets, and had not one single problem getting these wonderful cookies to come off.  This was the first time I have ever made macaroons and I am sure I will be using this recipe again and again.  Thank you for sharing!

1. Had no condensed milk, so I combined skim with sour cream in equal parts.
2. I shredded a fresh coconut.
3. The batter was very watery, so I put it through a fine strainer.
4. I used the liquid strained in Step 3, combined with some flour, to make...something, Not sure what, but it tastes coconutty.

I doubled the recipe and added a 12 oz. bag of chocolate chips.  I did not refrigerate the dough before forming and they turned out terrific!  Warm sweetened condensed milk can smell a little like cheese, but once they cooled the smell was gone.

This is so easy and good. I’ve made it with ½ almond extract & ½ vanilla ( excellent!) and this time I tried it with ½ coconut extract & vanilla. But my favorite discovery was if I moisten my hands with a little water I can roll my scoops into little balls without getting all sticky. It may be just my oven but I also had to bake them a little longer to get the that toasted coconut color.

I made these exactly as the recipe calls for and they were truly delicious! I also put a little chocolate shell on some of them which was a wonderful addition. I will definitely make them again. They were quick and easy and the cooking time was just right. My family loved them too. I might make one small change when I make them again. I want to put 1 3/4 tsp vanilla and 1/4 tsp almond or coconut extract to bring out the coconut flavor a little more

I   love the simplicity of the recipe and how exotic they seem to be, with not a whole lot of effort.  After serving to some friends, I was begged to do it again.  Think I gained a Christmas gift idea!

I love this recipe! I have made it countless times and always get awesome feedback :) I like to wear gloves when mixing the dough since it’s super messy! Also GF flour with xanthan gum also works great. Thanks for the recipe!

Ive tried adding several different ingredients such as chocolate chips both dark and milk.  Everyone's favorite was when I added cinnamon chips to the mix.  Just another suggestion but Yummy.

This recipe is amazing!  My boyfriend loves coconut & has been after me for a while to make him some coconut macaroons.  I looked around online as I usually do for a recipe with ingredients I could afford.  I found this one & wrote it down.  Yesterday I bought the ingredients & made them.  He said "These things are awesome!"  I did make them on my baking stone since I didn't have parchment paper.  They didn't stick on that.  I put them in a plastic container & put them in the refrigerator.  That made them even better.  I don't care for coconut because of the texture but I have eaten one of these a few times when nobody was looking.  These are good enough for me to ignore the texture! I will definitely be making these many times again.

Absolutely delicious and incredibly easy. Parchment paper on the baking trays makes clean up a snap as well. I used a melon baller type scoop to make perfect mounds, they all cooked evenly and looked perfect. A definite keeper.

Unfortunately the macaroons didn't turn out as hoped. I don't know where I went wrong. The recipe states it makes 15, I got 29. It said to cook for 15-18 minutes; mine were in for 22 minutes and they didn't cook properly. Quite a disappointment. I will try again!

Very good! I've made these before but this time they were better. Changes I made this time: I used paddle attachment on my mixer to mix, chilled batter 2 hours, made smaller in size about half a golf ball in size and lowered temp by 25 degrees and increased cook time.  Which gave nice light brown color, crisp on outside moist on inside. I used silicone mats - let them cool completely and they pop right off no sticking.  hope I can remember my changes! With the changes these are the best macaroons I've ever had.

I am a review person--focusing on the 1 or 2 star rating.  I am not a big coconut person, but I bake every week for my kids. so I always look for new recipes.  These cookies are AWESOME,  For those who said they tasted like scm, maybe you did't mix the ingredients together enough?  I left out the salt, used vanilla and almond extracts.  I also used my smallest cookie scoop and a silpat mat for baking.  I am going to make these again later in the week for my #2 cookie for my cookie exchange.  PS..I am going to drizzle them in chocolate:-)

doubled the recipe, used 1 tsp vanilla, 1 tsp almond extract. Chilled for two hours, used ice cream scoop to form balls, dip fingers in cold water to eliminate stickiness, balls were slightly larger than golf balls, next time I will make them smaller. Because after 15 minutes they were still a little undercooked with browning tops, lowered temp to 330 to cook longer.
Will drizzle/dip in chocolate.

This is so good and very easy to make. I added about a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips into the mixture and baked a little longer than recommended to get a very toasty coconut texture. A big hit!

Made it twice because people kept requesting it and I even passed the recipe on. Very good. Not too sweet and I followed the recipe the first time. The second time I still followed the recipe but when cooking it I makes them into smaller balls and cooked it a little longer to make it extra chewy. Will be keeping this recipe.

These were perfect. I usually make macaroon with egg whites so I was kinda scared to try them out. I love how with this recipe I can easily roll them up into cute little balls. And they end up looking great!But  I did have to increase my baking time by 10 minutes to ensure they browned well.

This is a great recipe, exactly as posted. I've made them several times, always with excellent reviews.  One hint to make it easier-- when forming the macaroon, dampen your fingers or the scoop; the mixture will slide off easier.  A couple of embellishments:  Use one tsp. almond and one tsp. vanilla.  And/or embed an almond in the center of each one.  Or put an almond on top of each one.  Any way you make them, this is a simple and fail-safe recipe.

I give this an "A" for its simplicity.  Parchment paper and refrigerating the dough is important. The taste and texture left me wanting a different recipe.

Love this recipe. Best macaroons ever. Since there's no egg you don't run the risk of them being eggy. Since it has lots of sweetened condensed milk they don't get dry like many macaroons I've had. And are get super chewy and soft after baking! I've tried them with almond extract (substituting half the vanilla) and they're bomb. Parchment paper is a must -- I've tried wax paper and foil, and both stuff. I actually oil the parchment paper and sticking is never an issue. One complaint -- before they get toasted enough on top, they are too brown on the bottom. Not sure if it's my oven or not.

These are so easy and fantastic. My family makes these every year for Christmas, and I was looking for a recipe to replicate it now that I live on a different continent. These are it!

I made this recipe but i found that they were a bit too hard. Any idea as to why? Too much coconut? Too much flour? Too long in the oven??

These are my hubby's favorite. I usually press an almond on top before baking and then drizzle with melted chocolate chips after baking!

This is a great recipe. I don't change anything except baking for longer (25 min). May just be my oven. Some hints: 1)Grease and flour the parchment paper to prevent the paper from sticking 2) I chilled the batter for a few hours before scooping them to help with the stickiness 3) I used a metal tablespoon as the scoop. It gave the perfect golf ball size. 4) Keep a bowl of water nearby to dip and clean the tablespoon when the batter starts to stick to it. Other than that, it's a super easy desert. I like to dip in melted chocolate to fancy it up.

Cookies came out great. But waaaay too sweet. I used sweeten coconut flakes because that's all they had at few stores I went to. 5 star probably with unsweetened. Again personal preference. For me they were too sweet but my dh loves them.

I needed some sort of deliciousness (who doesnt on a Saturday afternoon?!) and stumbled upon this little beauty. Simple recipe and very easy to do. I live in Spain so finding the right ingredients was predicted to be a nightmare but surprisingly I found everything I was looking for. The results are that my boyfriend keeps sneaking into the kitchen to grab another one when I'm not looking. He approves! And so do I. Many thanks and Happy Saturday!!

Very good. A little sweet, I'd use 1/2 or all un-sweetened coconut. Cook about twice as long. They only keep for about 2-3 days.

Lovely recipe ... these macaroons were a complete hit. In fact, I didn't even get the opportunity to drizzle chocolate over them, that's how quickly they were gone! 
I made the first 20 macaroons as round golf balls, however they didn't attain the lovely golden shade that I wanted even after 20 minutes. So with the remainder of the dough, I made them first into balls and then pressed them at the center to get a slightly uneven/flattened shape. These browned very well in the same time-span as the balls. I'd like to try this sometime with perhaps half a cherry/some jam in the center of the macaroons so that there's a lovely 'surprise' when you bite into them! Definitely a keeper ... thanx for sharing Fratcook! :)

I'd never made a macaroon before these and I'll admit, I didn't follow the recipe like I should have. I am getting ready to move and cleaning out the cabinets and had about 3/4 of a bag of sweetened coconut to use. The cookies turned out fabulously! I reduced everything by half and shrunk them down a bit, dropped the heat to 325* and baked them for about 18 minutes on a Silpat liner on a cookie sheet. Crunchy and toasty on the outside, chewy and delicious on the inside. Will definitely make these again!

Made these for the first time tonight.  They were good, but they taste like they're missing something.  I made the recipe exact and I don't know - I can't quite put my finger on what it's missing..  I was expecting these to be like the coconut macaroons you get at the Chinese food buffet, but they weren't very close to that.

This makes yummy, chewy macaroons. I followed the recipe except for mixing the vanilla with the milk and they came out great. Another flavour would be good, also I only had fat free sweetened condensed milk and it worked just fine. I did get 2 1/2 dozen out of these though, I'd say they were slightly smaller than golf ball sized and they were the perfect size for me. I oiled my hands and rounded and flattened them a little so they were more compact and without so much coconut sticking out. They took the whole 15 minutes to cook, but next time I might turn it down to 325 and just turn the broiler on for a couple of minutes at the end, they were drier in the middle than I would have liked.  I also took some melted chocolate and drizzled it over them using a plastic bag once they were cool.

This is an incredibly easy recipe that yields fantastic results! I used aluminum foil coated lightly with nonstick spray (though I'm not sure the nonstick spray was necessary). I also used sweetened flake coconut,  1 tsp. vanilla, and 1 tsp. almond extract and the flavor balance was perfect. I think the suggested golf ball size might be a bit big for my tastes, as these are very sweet. I made mine slightly smaller and checked after 10-11 minutes.

Made this almost exactly as written. The only thing I changed was to sub 1 tsp of almond extract for a tsp of vanilla. So good! Thanks for the great recipe!

OMG!  Don’t make these things.  Most especially if you like coconut, they are decadent.  It’s a very simple recipe that is almost impossible to mess up.  Do use parchment paper.  Cooking time will vary sligtly depending on the size of the cookie drop.  If you want them round for dipping in chocolate, moisten your hands slightly and roll into balls.  I prefer them plain and just dropped onto the parchment paper.  That way the coconut shreds stick out a bit and brown nicely for a lovely presentation.  With the holidays coming up soon, these are definitely going to be featured in my cookie gift baskets.  Thanks for the recipe!  Marsha

I loved it! This was so delicious and when using parchment paper its no mess. I used sweetened coconut and it was so good, I think maybe next time I might add some lime juice for a twist.

Its been awhile since I made this but I think I did 325 for just 16 minutes and it was perfect, but I cant recall Ill try it again and revise this but I know it was really good and I ate almost all by myself--which is why I haven't made anymore in awhile:)

I literally just finished baking these! They turned out perfectly! This was my first time ever making coconut macaroons, let alone using coconut in a recipe. I halved this recipe only because I had the  oz bag of coconut, instead of the 14oz, which would have made the whole 5 1/2 cups. It didn't make a whole lot, but I suppose I did make them on the bigger size. I baked them for about 20-25 minutes and they came out perfectly: Golden brown on the top and chewy and soft on the inside. I melted chocolate chips and butterscotch chips and added a drop of Crisco shortening and drizzled it over the top. They really did turn out perfectly and look delicious as well! I am going to save this recipe and this will be the only one I will use for macaroons! Love, love, love them!

Loved these. I didn't have condensed milk but I used a can evaporated milk with 1/2 cup of sugar which was plenty sweet. I thickened the evaporated milk with the sugar over the stove.

This is a great recipe. Since I've discovered this recipe on allrecipes.com, I have made it successfully numerous times, without fail. I just follow the recipe. 
What I do in addition, is that I dip the bottom part of the macaroons into melted dark chocolate. I heat a slab of dark chocolate (cut up into smaller pieces) in the microwave and dip only 2/8" of the macaroons in it. I leave it to cool upside down on a wire rack. It hardens nicely and looks delectable. 
It makes a great gift too.

I have made this cookies dozens of times, especially for church events and receptions.  They are always some of the first cookies to be emptied from platters.  I decorate with a half maraschino cherry and sometimes, a chocolate drizzle.

This should be a 3.5 rating. I made these exactly as the recipe states and while they were good and held a very pretty shape they just didn't taste like a real macaroon. When you consider the fact that there are only 5 ingredients you will understand why/how they turn out to taste like sweetened condensed milk and coconut rather than the usual sticky cake like macaroons that you get from a bakery. I believe a recipe with egg whites and possibly more flour would have been better.

These macaroons are so easy to make!  I followed the recipe as stated and used parchment paper without any problems.  The first time I made them, I made them too big (about 2 inches wide and 1 inch high), and it took 30 minutes to get the perfect brownness.  They tasted too doughy, but still delicious.  Maybe also because I didn't mix the flour and coconut too well.  I refrigerated them, and they tasted even better the next day.  The second time I made them, I made sure to mix the flour and coconut well.  I used a 1 tablespoon cookie scooper and got 40 macaroons.  It still took 30 minutes, but this was the perfect batch.  Yum!

Pretty good. Quick. I topped them with maraschino cherry halves but next time will try drizzling them with chocolate. I actually got 3 dozen out of this. Twelve minutes was just right in my oven.

Another happy reviewer.    I also did half vanilla and half almond to tasty results.  I made these half the rec'd size and baked them on aluminum foil; they were very easy to remove.  I did refrigerate them for a couple of hours, but I think less time would also suffice.  I did toast the coconut flakes before mixing them into the batter, b/c I didn't want to overcook the cookies to get the flakes to toast.  It sounded reasonable, and may have worked, but I forgot the cookies, and they ended up a little over-toasted anyways.  Still very tasty, and it gives me the excuse to makes these again.

Quick and easy recipe! I made them for Christmas gifts along with a ton of other things. The Macaroons were basically effortless and tasted amazing.  I wanted them to look a bit more toasty so I also broiled them for about 1 min. I did dip half of them in chocolate almond bark and the other half in vanilla almond bark, then drizzled with chocolate almond bark. They looked very fancy :)

This was my first attempt at macaroons and this recipe was so quick and easy I look forward to making more. I will reduce the size next time as the recipe made 24 very large cookies. As a twist I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp maple flavoring. Next time I may use 2 tsp maple flavoring.

This recipe is crazy simple and really tasty. I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will be sure to roll the macaroons into smoother balls. Some pieces of coconut were sticking out and got a little overdone, but otherwise they're great. I used parchment paper and they slid right off without a problem (despite the mixture being very sticky before cooking).

I don't know why you would change the recipe as these are excellent just like they are!  Best ever!  I really like them when they are cooked long enough to be brown all the way around....so chewey and yummy.

I once made them about 1" across and after they were cooled down, dipped them in chocolate, and it was almost like a candy bar....perfect treat!

The hardest part about making these is the mixing.  My KitchenAid mixer was working hard, but mixing by hand was quite a workout.

Thank you so much for the fantastic recipe...my husband is a macaroon lover and these were a big hit!  They'll be on the Christmas Cookie tray tomorrow and I know they won't last...even though I doubled the recipe this time.

I've been making coconut macaroons for years. The recipe I've been using calls for egg whites vs the sweetened condensed milk in this recipe. These are definitely more moist, but a lot more rich. I always like to dip the bottoms of my macaroons in a touch of dark chocolate and drizzle just a bit on top. This made for a truly decadent dessert!

I ended up making smaller portions, the directions say to either use tin foil or waxed paper to line your cookie sheets, well I used tin foil and they stuck terribly! 
But still turned out well!

I have been making this recipe for years. For an extra kick, after I take them out of the oven and transfer to the cooling rack, I take a measuring spoon and drizzle with Grand Marnier.  So yummy!

Never made macaroons at home, but these really were a sinch. I was only surprised by the amount, easily over 3 dozen... I guess that's 3 per serving.  Anywho, they were a little on the salty side, so next time no salt will be added (I don't mind but hubby noticed) Also I used shaved cocnut, not flaked, as they don't commercialize it in Spain.  Still turned out great. Thanks for a wonderfully easy recipe!

I loved it but used 1/2 cup flour with 4 1/2 cups coconut, followed else wise and added the zest of one orange to brighten the flavors up. Gooey and yummy!

Excellent!!! Came out just like at the bakery!! Chilled dough half an hour and rolled in my hands to shape. I did bake for 20 minutes to get good color. I baked them on parchment. My boyfriend is very pleased!

I just love this!  Quick, easy and yummy!  I divided the mix into two parts and one part I did as per the recipe and the other I added some toffee chips.  Both of them turned out good. No wonder this recipe got so many good reviews!

This recipe has a delicious flavor. I made these for a party with a friend who eats gluten free, substituting the regular flour for GF oat flour, and have also made them with whole wheat flour. They are always a hit with everyone who has one. The reason I gave it 4 stars is that I find them a bit heavy, and am still searching for the "perfect" macaroon recipe; I will continue to make this one though as it is a crowd pleaser and quick to make for potlucks, etc.

I followed other suggestions of substituting a teaspoon of almond extract for one of the teaspoons of vanilla extract. It was delicious! They disappeared in a snap at my church.

Tasty macaroons.  I used sweentened coconuts since that's the only kind the store around here carry.  Golf ball size made the center of macaroon kind chewy and soft.  You may wanna make smaller balls or flatten a little if you'd prefer the crunch texture.  DO NOT use wax paper!! It'd stick!!

As recommended by another reviewer, I added 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract, everything else was the same.  Delicious. At Easter, I added a jelly bean and for Christmas, I'll add green and red candied cherries.

Wow. These were amazing! Stayed moist until they were all eaten days later. I put an M&M inside of some of them right once I took them out of the oven and it was a nice treat in the center. Yummy!

I followed the directions exactly.  It made twice the amount indicated and baked for the time it called.  I used to work at a bakery and these were the driest and hardest macaroons that I had ever eaten.  There was way too much coconut in them and maybe adding an egg would make them moister.  Still looking for a good macaroon recipe.

It was worthy of a birthday present to my dad, who ADORES macaroons, but always gets storebought.
Thank you FRATCOOK!!

THE BEST BASE RECIPE FOR MACAROONS THAT I HAVE USED.  I VARIED THE RECIPE BY ADDING A TABLESPOON OF INSTANT ESPRESSO COFFEE TO THE CONDENSED MILK, HEATED IT SLIGHTLY UNTIL THE COFFEE DISSOLVED, LET IT COOL AND FOLLOWED THE REST OF THE RECIPE AS IS.  THEY CAME OUT SO WELL, I NAMED THEM COCONUT CAPPUCINO MACAROONS.  I GARNISHED THEM WITH A CHOCOLATE COVERED ESPRESSO BEAN IN THE CENTER OF EACH AS SOON AS THEY CAME OUT OF THE OVEN.  WORD TO THE WISE...MAKE EXTRA BECAUSE YOUR GOING TO EAT HALF OF THEM BEFORE ANYONE ELSE GETS A CHANCE TO TRY THEM.

Great, classic macaroons.  I chose to drizzle melted semi-sweet chocolate on a few of mine.  I liked them better with the chocolate.

Great flavor, easy recipe! I would have given 5 stars, but I have a horrible time getting them off of the parchment paper.  I had to remove them immediately upon taking them from the oven or I was picking pieces of paper off the bottom.  Also, next time I will make them half-sized, for I found the center to chewy for my taste at golf ball size.

omg these are SO good.  I followed the recipe as directed.  I got 18 macaroons out of it and needed around 14 mins to cook them to the point of toasted I like.  This is an easy, keeper recipe!

amazing recipe, and very simple. HOWEVER, extra time in the oven would yield a toastier macaroon and they are way too sticky, even with parchment paper I had to cut the bottoms off. Apparently chilling the dough for a few hours eliminates most of the problem as does a silicon baking sheet.

Easy, quick, and reliable.  I set them out next to the host's chocolate fondue fountain so guests could cover theirs with chocolate if desired.

perfect EVERY time. last week i added a teaspoon of orange zest, then topped them off with a drizzle of white chocolate and a pinch of finely grated orange zest. i brought them for a charity bake sale at my job and they definitely held their own against the bakery-bought items. such a great recipe!

I make these without the flour and salt which are unnecessary, and the addition of 2 well beaten egg whites. I like them golden, so they seem a bit too crunchy at first, but if you put them in a plastic bag they soften up perfectly. If you like, drizzle or partially dip in chocolate.

Too sweet with an undesirable consistency (when swallowing it I felt like I was drinking the condensed milk straight from the can).  Wow.  I can't believe someone would sit and eat these.

I've always hated macaroons...until this recipe. It's delicious and doesn't taste like any macaroon I've ever eaten. I did add 1tsp almond extract like others have done. I used a cookie scoop and baked on parchment paper for 17 minutes. I liked them toasted all over nice and golden. This recipe made 34. This is a keeper.

YUMMY!! After buying macaroons at our Farmer's Market and I had to figure out how to make my own. I found this recipie and these takte identical to what I ate at the Market. I noticed some people were having problems with the cookies sticking to the parchment paper. I had that problem to and then realized I was using wax paper instead. Maybe others are making this same mistake? Even with my wax paper stuck to the bottom of some of the cookies, we're still eating and loving them!

I made smaller one-bite sized, and they cooked for 10 minutes.  They are not too sweet, and tender but sturdy enough that they hold together.  I also added a 1/2 tsp of almond extract, because that's how I like my macaroons.  This is a fantastic and easy recipe - much easier than the one I'd used previously, and with better results.  Thank you!

These were a hit with my hard-to-please husband! The best part was how simple they were - no eggs and few ingredients. For all you other Canadians who buy condensed milk in 300 ml cans, here's the my slightly-reduced converted recipe (I was still able to make 2 batches: 1 dozen larger macaroons + 10 smaller macaroons) 1/2 c. flour, 4 cups coconut, tiny pinch of salt, one 300-ml can sweetened condensed milk, 1.5 tsp vanilla extract.

These are the BEST.  They are so chewy and have the best flavor.  I will never use another macaroon recipe.  This recipe uses a lot more coconut than other recipes I have used and I love the change!

Loved these! Made them for a care package to mail to my mom for Mother's Day and they held up great in the mail as well as tasted fantastic. I have since made them several more times and found that refrigerating the "dough" for awhile (30-60 minutes) before scooping them onto the cookie sheet keeps the liquid from spreading too much on the pan.

Excellent recipe: easy, fool-proof and delish! Had the urge for something sweet tonight. Looked through this site, found this recipe and had and had all the ingredients in the pantry and voila- done. 2 things tho: 1. I preferred with without any chocolate. Sweet already and doesn't need the choco competing w/ it and 2. watch the cooking time. Took approx 16 mins for me- not 12-15 mins as indicated. They were perfectly cooked and alittle brown on some parts. Thank you very much for this recipe. Will make again and again!

I make these every holiday season!  I bake on silpat lined sheets and use a cookie scooper (like an ice cream scooper) and they turn out beautifully!  I usually dip about half of them in melted chocolate.  People rave about these but I keep the secret recipe to myself because it's so easy yet impressive!

Yum! I love the fact that it was so easy to make with little ingredients. Though, it was hard to stir and very sticky. Need man muscles for this.

i made this macaroon dough and i took some of those caramel cubes you can get from any grocery store and put one inside each uncooked macaroon (make sure to comepletely cover it with the dough) and baked them that way, then i dipped the bottoms of the macaroons in melted milk chocolate and drizzled some over them. they were AMAZING!! i totally recommend trying this recipe (and alteration)!!!!

My husband requested that I make him macaroons, so after making a recipe from one of my cookbooks which turned out more like merengue cookies, I tried this. Every time he eats them he tells me how wonderful they are!

After eating store-bought macaroons, my mouth watered in anticipation of making homemade ones. Had all the ingredients … but short on some so I improvised. 1) used one 5-oz bag of coconut – unsweetened, but had sweetened leftovers from another recipe so added enough to round out 5-1/2 cups. 2) Needed 14 oz sweetened condensed milk; only had two 5-oz cans – short 3 oz (per measuring cup) so I added heavy whipping cream (for lack of knowing what else to use). Used other ingredients listed. Mixed dry ingredients in one bowl, wet in another then combined the two. Using vinyl 'exam' gloves on hands (which I do with all my recipes), I stirred mixture then chilled dough for 30 minutes. Covered cookie sheet with foil, I spooned on coconut mix using a 1-Tablespoon scoop rounding dough with my hands. Baked 23 balls for 15 minutes, adding 3 minutes using 1 minute increments for total of 18 minutes. Coconut still was not toasteded brown but middle was soft. Cooled, then tested. First bite confirmed what I already knew ... blah. Second day, they were somewhat tasty. Put balls back in 350 degree oven for extra 15 minutes. As they baked again, smell of coconut filled the kitchen. Next time I will use sugared coconut and 1 tsp each of vanilla and almond extract. Thanks for the challenge.

There is really not any cookie consistency to these. This is shown in how they don't really change size when you bake them,they just kind of melt a little bit.  They are just  more like sweet gobs of coconut.

I've tried numerous coconut macaroon recipes, and although this isn't better than my other favorite, it's easier to roll into balls and the balls maintained their shape better while baking (chill the batter before rolling).  I plan to make this my "go-to" recipe now.  Because these hold their shape better, it's easy to pour a chocolate glaze on - they look more uniform and professional.  If stored in an air tight container, I find these are fine for a couple weeks.

These were amazing.  I dipped the bottoms in melted Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate, too.  I covered the cookie sheets with tinfoil and sprayed with bakers' spray (contains flour) and there was no issue with any of them sticking.

This was a very simple and fast recipe for macaroons. It had more of a cake like consistency versus a very sugary, dense consistency of standard store bought macaroons. They cooked a bit longer for me--about 18 minutes and I got about 16 golf sized macaroons. I let them stand for about 1 hour to solidify and drizzled them with chocolate. I used 1 14oz package of sweetened coconut flakes and added 1 tsp of almond extract to sub for 1 tsp of vanilla.

Very good and easy to make.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I thought they could have used a little more flavor.  I ended up drizzling melted chocolate on them because I felt like they needed something.  Next time I'm going to try almond extract.

Ok, I bet these cookies would have been good but I used evaporated milk.  Not knowing that there is a difference in sweetened milk & evporated milk.  I don't bake very often, lol   I'm so disappointed, I was so looking forward to these.

very yummy! they were sweet like i like them especially with melted chocolate on top. yes they are very simple to make but very sticky and I made a disaster of the kitchen. My only problem was i had 2 cookie sheets one on top on on the bottom and not thinking that the ones on the bottom won't toast on the top the way the ones on the top will, so i burt the bottom of those ones. However, even those burnt ones were good lol. this recipe makes much more than a dozen, mine were a little smaller than golf ball size but not much. i made about 30 cookies in total with this one recipe. very good, will definitely make again!

These were delicious!! The taste and texture of the inside of these cookies is alot like a mounds bar.  They are sweet and gooey, so if that is not what you like, these are not for you.  They held their shape well and baked to a toasted golden brown color in about 16 minutes at 325 degrees.  I got 30 cookies out of this recipe using a purple handle/#40 scoop from a restaurant supply store (GFS) They were about the size of a golf ball cut in half or a little over a Tablespoon.  This was plenty big as these are rich.    To make them easier to mix first combine the milk and vanilla then whisk in the flour.  Add the coconut after all of the other ingredients are combined.  I baked them on a silpat/Matfer type silicon baking sheet and had no trouble with then sticking or falling apart.  Immediately removed them from the pans to waxed paper sprayed with a little cooking spray.    For a really elegant presentation, dip the bottoms in dark chocolate and then into chopped pistachios. I served them in mini cupcake liners for less mess.  Delicious!!

My Mom and Sister love Macaroons and they ate all of these within a week! I did mix the milk and vanilla in one bowl; the coconut and flour in another. tossed coconut and flour until evenly coated. Omitted salt...isn't necessary to the taste. Dumped floured coconut into milk mixture and mixed with a wooden spoon. It takes a few minutes to make sure everything is evenly mixed. I do not recommend mixing batter with hands as you will more than likely get a drier cooked version of this cookie. Used a Pampered Chef medium scoop to drop cookies onto parchment paper. Baked for 15 minutes. Result: a wonderful, delicious, gooey, toasted coconut macaroon!

These were great.  Didn't have an ice cream scoop an appropriate size so rolled them into balls by hand.  The cookie sheet I used is a double layer sheet which only needed to be sprayed with a vegetable spray.  The cookies came off very easy and held their shape.  Did cut back on the sweetened condensed milk to 2/3 of a 14 oz. can.  Baked for the 12-15 minutes and they came out nicely browned.  These were so quick and easy will definately make again.  They are very pretty topped off with a marashino cherry too.

Wow, what a great recipe!  It was easy and quick.  Great tip to spray the foil -- it worked wonderfully, and I had no trouble with sticking.  I also made the macaroons smaller (I used a tablespoon to make the balls) and baked for 15 minutes and they came out toasty, golden, and delicious!

A perfect macaroon in my opinion.  Used FF condensed milk (what I had on hand), lined my cookie sheets with foil, and used non stick spray.  No problems at all with sticking.  I used my cookie scoop to form the macaroons, and they held their shape nicely.  As a side note I used leftover fudge filling from Fudge Puddles from this site to dip half of the macaroons in.  It was delicious and worked like a charm!

I'm rating this based on what BF said and, according to him, they are his new favorite. I thought they were incredibly easy to make and would be great dipped in chocolate. Regarding other reviewers' comments on the stickiness of the batter: yes, the batter is sticky, but I had no trouble scooping out spoonfuls, shaping them into balls with my hands and then plopping them down on the cookie sheet. Thanks!

Just finished making these.  Awesome! I made them according to the recipe directions but I added semi sweet morsels and I chilled dough for an hour before forming into cookies as suggested by others. This is much easier than the recipe I have that contains egg whites.  I like them both but this one is the easiest.

Excellent.  I bake these on a pizza stone and have no trouble with sticking.  I don't refrigerate the dough.  After baking, I take a glass dipped in sugar and slightly tough the tops to flatten and give a sweet sparkle.  I do like to add almond flavoring.

Nice recipe, confussing measurments. I only used a 300 ML can of con. milk because thats the only size here. It turned out good so it wasnt an issue. My big issue was I used parc. paper, sprayed with pam and still i could not get the cookies off the tray they stuck to the parc. paper and 3/4 had to have the bottom cut off because the paper stuck to them. I would make these again but try to think of a way to have them not stick again.

We all really enjoyed this recipe and it was easy to make.  Quick too.  Next time I'd like to try with almond extract.  I accidentally put like 1c too much coconut and then added a little more flour to correct my mistake, and they still came out good.  The sweetness factor is a matter of ones palate.

This recipe could not be any easier!  The reason I gave this a four star is because they are just sooo sweet and there is no way to cut down on the amount of sugar in these cookies.

This was a good an easy recipe.  To cut some of the sweetness I used unsweetened coconut with great success.  I also found that these tasted much better the day after they were made.  So if possible, make them a day before serving.

Sooo Good! I got rave reviews of these over the holidays. I followed the recipe exactly and then drizzled melted chocolate over the top and everyone loved them. Definitely use parchment paper on your pans or these will stick.

I followed the recipe Exactly & they were great, I will try Parchment paper next time as opposed to foil (had a hard time removing them)...and I might try less Milk to cut the sweetness next time, Otherwise they were GREAT!!! Boyfriend Loved them & ate almost the whole batch the first night!

I thought this was a great, easy recipe.  I used 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp almond extract, which resulted in a pretty strong almond flavor (which I happened to like).  Would be complemented by a whole almond stuck in the top of the cookie before baking.  These do not spread much during baking, so if you want them to have a nice shape, you have to roll them into a ball before baking or use a rounded scoop.  We got about 40 average sized cookies from the recipe. Would be great dipped in melted chocolate.

I love macaroons and these are great.  I do the recipe exactly and sometimes I will coat some of them in the chocolate almond bark........my favorite cookie of all time.  This is the second Christmas I've made them.  They freeze well and they store very well.

These macaroons were so simple.  I did use half vanilla and almond extract, then placed cherry in center, and drizzled with dark chocolate, yummy!  I made them last night and I am making another batch to send of to my niece at law school.  I have been trying a lot of the top rated cookie recipes getting ready for the holidays.  Try the award winning soft chocolate chip cookies.  These are two thumbs up.

I covered the cookie sheets with aluminum foil and sprayed the foil with pam. The macaroons came right off! They tasted great. I melted some chocolate chips and dipped the macaroons in the chocolate.

I love macaroons, and had never made them before so I decided to try this recipe.  It's excellent.  The dough is pretty sticky, so I agree with other reviews that the parchment paper is really a must.  I also make much smaller macaroons then the recipe calls for (which then also makes more of them in a batch) and cook them about a minute or two less, and they turn out great.  Also like to dip half the cookie in chocolate to fancy them up :)

Easy! No mixer or eggs needed. Used 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. almond extract. Added 1/2 maraschino drained cherry to each (I've done chocolate drizzle but this is easier). I had my oven at 325, six minutes then rotate baking sheet for another six minutes while on parchment paper. I made 4 dz. regular size cookies. This is my go-to cookie, just made a bunch for a Xmas cookie exchange and put on paper cups. Thank you Fratcook!

These were fantastic - everyone raved at how great they were. I used Bakers brand coconut and the result was a very moist center and wonderfully crisp and chewy exterior. I had to bake for a few extra minutes but that's just because of how my oven is.

Can't get much easier than this recipe for a macaroon! Not exactly the soft, fluffy cookie I was looking for but it sure does cure the coconut craving quickly :)

Delicious! Cookies were moist, gooey, and sweet. Also, very simple to make, which is good for me as I can ruin the simplest recipes. Instead of 2 tsp vanilla I added 1 vanilla and 1 almond, came out perfect. I made the cookies large, so fifteen minutes was the right baking time for me. Made these as a suprise for my mom who had been craving them, she loved them!

What a snap to whip together! Definitely not the light, fluffy macaroons that I'm used to, but quite delicious! Couldn't eat too many of them though, as they are so rich! I used half vanilla and half almond extract with success.

I used parchment paper sprayed with professional Pam and they came off with no trouble whatsoever.

Next time I think I would try packing the coconut firmly into the measuring cup and  might try using sweetened coconut as others have suggested.

YUM!

awesome!! cooked up perfectly!
i added a teensy bit of almond extract just for my taste, but the recipe is fine on its own.  
definitely blue ribbon...also good dipped in chocolate.

This recipe was awesome and sooo easy to make.  I took advice from others and added 1/2 tsp of almond flavouring, mixing it with the vanilla into the condensed milk.  Decorate them with green/red cherries...excellent christmas cookie.  Thanks for posting!!

I made these for Christmas last year everyone who tried them went nuts for them.  I'm not a big fan of coconut, but I must say I really ate to many.  Try dipping them half way into melted chocolate.  Very good!!

Never made macarrons before but this was just so easy and tasty.  My suggestion is to keep the flour to a scant 2/3 cup and bake longer to make sure the coconut browns.  My first batch was a little underdone but delicious nonetheless.  i will defintiely be making this one again!

Wow.  I am amazed at the rave reviews this has gotten.  No wonder we Americans are so overweight.  This recipe is extremely gooey and sweet.  Sure, the first one you eat is pretty good, but go for a second and you'll feel ill, and that was even though I made my smaller than the reciped specified.

This was my first attempt at making macaroons.  They turned out to be delicious.  I made the first dozen plain and the second dozen I added mini chocolate chips.  I actually liked the ones with chocolate chips better.  Definitely a keeper.

First time making macaroons - very yummy!  Per other reviewers, we did turn the temp down on one batch, but truthfully I think the original temp is better.  Also, did dip some in chocolate, and i definitely prefer the plain ones!  Thanks so much for the post!

Truly fantastic - I made a singel batch and split into two, adding chopped macadamia nuts to one half and mini chocolate chips to the other. They were perfect, probably the best cookies I've made in a year. My boyfriend said they "rocked his world", and his coworkers are already clamoring for more. A+!

Oh.  Mah.  Gawd

Best macaroons I have ever had ever in my life.  I accidentally cut my hand open opening the condensed milk but the macaroons totally made up for the injury.  

I made it exactly as the recipe states (except the salt--I nearly always skip salt in cookie recipes) and they turned out perfect.  I'm not ashamed to say I ate almost the whole batch myself last night :p

Thanks so much for the recipes, I bet it does take first place in a lot of fairs.

i'm experimenting for a cookie exchange and these are the winner.  i invested in parchment paper (awesome! worth the $5!) and used sweetened coconut.  as suggested i mixed the vanilla and SCMilk before adding to dry ingredients.   dampen hands with H2O while forming balls. i will dip some of them in melted dark chocolate.  yum!

These are delicious! I baked mine in cupcake papers. Next time I'll spray a little Pam in the bottom of each cup, as they did stick a little. I have already passed this recipe on and I will definately make them again!

I like this recipe better than Eagle Brand one.  The addition of the flour makes a big difference.  Instead of drizzling chocolate on them I put a candy kiss on them.  Dresses them up real nice.  I only made 1" balls and got 30 cookies.

I have been looking for a good macaroon recipe and now I have found it! This is the best I have ever tried!!! Thier very moist and just so good!!
I added a 1/2 tsp. of almond extract and 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. It gave it a very good flavor. Next time I'm going to try to drizzle melted chocolate over them! Thanks for the best macaroon recipe EVER!!!

Great tasting and easy recipe. I broiled these for a few seconds to toast the coconut and topped with a maraschino cherry. Definitely need to be a coconut lover to fully appreciate this recipe.

The cookies turned out great! However, I had extreme difficulties getting the cookies off the foil.  I haven't tried parchment paper yet, but will the next time I make them.  I hope it works better!

Super easy to make!  Second time I made these.  The first time I made them plain.  The second time I add a handful of mini semi sweet CC.  Both times I had to bake them for 28-30 min.  I like mine a little crispy on the bottom and the coconut edges on the top just turning brown.  Turned out perfect both times.  Next time I'll drizzle a little milk chocolate over the top.

First time making coconut macaroons and these were wonderful! Chewy inside and a little crisp on the outside. I left them in a tad longer because we like them a little more toasted tasting. I did split my extract as recommended...as 1 1/2tsp vanilla 1/2tsp almond. 
I also dipped half of them in chocolate at the bottoms. I will be making these again!

I made these exactly as listed.  I'm at high altitude and they still turned out fantastic.  The only problem I had was that I was out of parchment and used foil; they stuck to the foil.  I will use parchment next time.

I’ve made more traditional coconut macaroons before with egg whites and loved them but this was so easy I wanted to try it. I’m just not that impressed. The texture is not as light as I wanted and I want them a little sweeter. I dipped them in chocolate. I’m hoping it helps.

I followed the recipe precisely except.......I used almond extract and then dipped the bottoms in semi-sweet chocolate (after cooking and cooling).  To die for!  I do not understand why some people had them fall apart, mine are firm and chewy.  Do not pack the coconut when you measure, just loose.  A 14 oz. bag is enough with a half cup left over.  Anyway, the cookies turned out perfect.  I will be making some more before Christmas.  Thanks Kristil!

I LOVED THIS  I made half of the above recipe because I didn’t have that much coconut. I accidentally used the full2 teaspoons instead of 1, and it still turned out really sweet!! This is amazing, and the rest are in the oven as I write.

This is a really good recipe, I tried it just as the recipe stated and they turned out really good, then I tried it with the suggestions found in the reviews and used 1 teaspoon Vanilla, and 1 teaspoon Almond extract, and used half the condensed milk with half of a can of Coconut Cream (after you open the can you must stir the contents)  from Trader Joe's.  This recipe was also delicious!  I used a mini cookie scoop about 1 inch wide and the recipe yielded 40 macaroons.

Phenomenal- I followed the recipe- and put monkfruit sweetener crystals on top- oh wow! I was thinking about experimenting with almond flour- and unsweetened milk, to see if I could make these ok for the training table. Really great- no egg taste, because there are no eggs used! The guys loved these. Great recipe. :)

I made these cookies for a luncheon and will definitely make them again.
I would suggest using a very large bowl to mix them in.  As others suggested, and I didn't listen, mix the vanilla in with the condensed milk or it will clump with the dry ingredients.  I also used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract.  I baked them for 15 minutes because I liked the golden color.  A little crunchy on the outside, but soft and gooey on the inside.   The recipe made 4 1/2 dozen for me.  Definitely a keeper.

LOVE this recipe!  Very quick and easy!  Some people dip the bottom of the cookie in chocolate, I like putting a maraschino cherry in the top before baking.  

This is my go-to recipe any time I think of making macaroons.

These are so tasty and easy to make. I did substitute one of the teaspoons of vanilla for almond extract just because of personal preference, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. Absolutely delicious! These are doing to be my go-to recipe for potlucks etc. Thanks for the recipe.

Really easy to make and it tastes pretty good. It's really messy, though. I drizzled some melted chocolate on top of the cookies, so you can try that if you want.

I was able to get more out of the mix by simply changing up how I do things. The first time I made these, I wasted so much by using my hands (as suggested in the instructions) because the product is so sticky. Since this time I was making them for a somber occasion, I didn't feel like being *whimsical* and decided to work cleaner. First, I mixed the flour and salt. Next, I added the coconut and stirred by hand, making sure that the flour coated the coconut. After I added the condensed milk, I made sure it was also well blended. I did find using the ice cream scooper was a great help. I used four bags of coconut, which should have yielded 48 macaroons. In the end, I had 80 really good sized cookies. Most importantly, they were delicious. I have also done a chocolate bottom with this recipe. They are fantastic either way.

These turned out great. The only thing I would do differently is maybe add coconut extract to bring out more of the coconut flavor.

Yummy version of a favorite Christmas cookies...
Ive spent years hunting for a similar recipe to my grandmas macaroons recipe...found this 1 & decided to try it this yr...
Almost identical tasting to my grandmas...
Also- I made 2 batches- 1 with vanilla extract, the other with almond extract- the almond extract is as wonderful tasting as the vanilla...

This is the first time I've ever made macaroons, it was quick and easy, plus it doesn't hurt that they tase so good.  For a gluten free alternative, I used all purpose gluten free flour and they turned out great.  Will definitely be making these again!

I make these every year and get rave reviews. Its almost embarrassing how easy they are. I make plain ones, and then I also drizzle melted chocolate on them, or I put a whole almond on top before baking and then drizzle the chocolate on top. (Almond Joy!)

I made these with unsweetened coconut and they’re tasty, but I’m used to a sweeter macaron. The recipe doesn’t specify what kind of coconut is to be used, is it supposed to be sweetened?

These were a bit hard to work with, very sticky, but we'll worth the effort.  I used one teaspoon vanilla and one teaspoon almond extract.  Delicious!  Many requests for the recipe.  Happy Granny

I LOVE LOVE this recipe!! I’ve made it more than once. I used foil with a light buttery spray on it and removed off off baking sheet IMMEDIATELY after pulling out of the oven. I added a teaspoon of almond extract and also some mini semi-sweet chocolate chips. This recipe is so versatile. You can add dried cranberries, chopped pecans (or any but really) and dip in melted milk chocolate. A very easy recipe and tastes DEE-LISH!!! Thanks for sharing!

They were good! I doubled the recipe because I was making for a big group .( I ended up with about 60). Only 2/60 didn’t like them so I definitely recommend making them, even a few people said they didn’t like coconut but they still liked these macaroons!

I’ve had the ingredients to make these for some time now and finally took a few minutes to mix them up today and oh my goodness are they good!
One bag of coconut isn’t enough for the recipe, so I just cut down the other ingredients accordingly and they are soft and chewy on the inside and glorious golden brown on the outside.  Definitely a keeper to make again and again!

These needed to cook a bit longer (I think about 15 minutes), guess it depends on the size of the cookies but once they were done...OMG!  Perfection.  One thing I will do next time is to refrigerate the dough a couple of hours before cooking because my cookies spread slightly, but it didn't affect the taste at all,  just the looks, they were still a huge hit and will make this recipe again and again!

These turned out pretty good but they’re too sweet and way too chewy for my taste. I had hoped they’d bring me back to my years in France where I first tasted a true coconut macaron. Those were made with egg whites, coconut flakes, sugar, salt, vanilla, and some added water and had no flour involved. They were devine. I’ll keep looking for that recipe, thus one wasn’t bad though!

These are the best macaroons I've ever made.  Soft and gooey instead of the hard kind which are good too but not as much as these are.

So simple and delicious.  I used some chocolate for the bottoms on some and drizzled a little bit over the others.   I prefer making them smaller since they are very rich.

Yum! First time making macaroons! I did add 1 t almond extract in addition to the  2t of vanilla extract & mixed them in before adding to the coconut (1-14oz bag). Very sticky - hardest part was getting them on the cookie sheet. Used parchment so no sticking. Would probably refrigerate before scooping next time to make it easier. Cooked them 15-20 minutes. Made 40. I like the crispy coconut edges so I didn't run them out.

Made the recipe exactly as written. I think I made mine a little large though (measured 70 grams each) and it turned out 18 generously sized macaroons. Because of that, I ended cooking mine for about 24 minutes which still left them lightly golden on top. The flavor was fantastic. I used sweetened coconut which I thought would put the sweetness overboard but it was just right. The texture was firm on the outside and soft on the inside, just like it should be.

I also took the advice of a few reviewers and chilled the mixture before forming. After, I measured them out and with wet hands formed then into balls before pressing them down with a wet spoon. Only thing I would do next time is make them a bit smaller (50-60 grams each).

Very sticky and even when fully cooked ( I over cooked them because of being to mushy like) they still turned out delicious! I added a little bit of almond extract.

2nd time I made this. Difference this time was I chilled the dough longer and found it much easier to work with. I flattened the cookie just a bit before baking. Used 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond extract. Bake for 16 minutes to ensure browning. Next time will go 17 minutes.  Only had 7 oz of coconut but found the recipe very easy to half.

Perfect my son asked me to make again just made last week.. use almond and vanilla extract..and mini chips we love chocolate.  Have to laugh when reviews talk about evaporated milk and wonder why they are not good..
I did use a bit less flour.. and at Passover use egg whites but very good..

Turned out very good, will make again. I did have to substitute maple syrup in place of the vanilla as I did not have any but was a nice flavor, very light as its not a concentrate.

I give this four stars because of the simplicity to make and they are decent macaroons. It could potentially be a five except I used unsweetened coconut not realizing that sweetened is definitely what I should use and thats the fault of the recipe for not stating one or the other imo. I am fairly new to baking so tried to improve on the not sweet result by using chocolate to coat. Unfortunately all I had was semi sweet and even that should have been milk chocolate as semi sweet does have some bitterness that did not help the situation. I will make these again with what I have learned and I'm sure they will be much better but please correct the ingredients to be sweetened flakes!

Easy and excellent. I made 15 2oz macaroons from it being lazy, but they were too big to cook properly. They tasted good and are disappearing quickly. However, on my next round I will make 30 1oz cookies instead.

Made these the other day. Awesome! I have made other recipes and this reminds me of the ones from Nordstrom cafe. Delicious and hold their shape. I thought the flour might make them dry but they are moist.  Throwing out all other maccaroons recipes.

In Canada our condensed milk comes in a 300 ml size. This recipe calls for a 14 oz. can.  300 ml = 10.1 fluid oz.  and you need 414 ml to make 14 oz.  So I used one full can here & opened another & measured out another 125 ml. 
They tasted awesome.  Last batch is in oven now. Be careful not to burn them.    L. Wojick  Thunder Bay, On

These did not give me the "wow" I was hoping for.  I took the suggestion of others and added flavouring (glad I did).  I used rum extract, vanilla and coconut. the texture was more of a "cakey" texture even though I left them in the oven until they were golden in colour.  I probably should have figured this out as soon as I added the flour.

I used a small icecream scoop with a release button.  1/2 the recipe made 15   1.5" balls. no issues with it being too sticky this way.

This was my first try at macaroons and I was pleased. I followed the recipe except I used 1 tsp  vanilla and 1 tsp almond extracts.  I baked one dozen as instructed and then tried the second dozen at 300 for 25-30 min. as suggested by another reviewer.  Both batches turned out fine and I prefer the original method which takes less time.  I sprinkled cinnamon on the tops of three and enjoyed those as well.

I make these all the time.  They are so easy to make, delicious, and they're fun to customize - sometimes I use half almond extract/half vanilla, semi-sweet chocolate chips, and baked for 14 min.  I got 31 macaroons out of the recipe with my medium sized cookie scoop, and 51 with my small cookie scoop.  Baked for 11 min with small scoop, and always used a silicon mat.

So Good! This was very easy to make. I dipped them in chocolate, because everything is better with chocolate. Next time I will use my smaller ice cream scoop though. Great recipe

Only 1 concern. It is very hard to get them to cook properly. The outsides of mine burned but the inside was very under done.

These are very good! I made the recipe just as it states and I am pleased. I do think that next time I try these I will take some of the others advice and use almond extract, and cool in the fridge so I can shape better. I also added some chocolate to the top! It is a wonderful recipe!

This are delicious!  I had hoped to make them smaller, more of a one bite size, but I wasn't sure how long to bake them for so I followed the recommended size.  Yes, they were big and they did spread slightly into a hill shape rather than a ball but we gobbled them up and were with left wanting more!  
Thank you for this keeper!

If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would! I rarely bake from scratch, but these look and taste like I actually know what I'm doing in the kitchen! ?? My husband "hates" coconut, but he can't keep his hands off these. I will make them again. Thank you for the recipe!

Made this according to the recipe. There's nothing wrong with them, but they tasted too much of sweetened condensed milk to me. Also, they were a little loose--I prefer a macaroon that is a bit denser and holds its shape.

It was awesome. I followed the suggestions of adding 1 tbsp. of vanilla and almond extract to the sweetened condensed milk. Once they were done, I dipped them in chocolate. Everyone loved them!!!

I made these for my grandfather and he said these were the best macaroons he ever tasted.  I used some of the suggestions by other reviewers.  I used sweetened coconut and chilled the dough for one hour before baking which helped the cookies to maintain the classic macaroon form.  After scooping out the individual cookies I dipped my finger in water to smooth out any flakes that stuck out to prevent burning.  I baked them at a temperature 25 degrees lower than the recommended for a few extra minutes until they were nicely golden but still chewy inside.  After baking I cooled the cookies for 10 minutes then drizzled them with melted bittersweet chocolate and slightly crushed slivered almonds which I roasted ahead of time.  We will definitely be making these again!

I followed the recipe except for adding 1/2 t of almond extract, as suggested.  I also took the suggestion of leaving the dough in the refrigerator overnight.   Made rolling the balls easy.  I've never made these before- I had coconut I had to use up.  Will make again! These are amazing!

I followed the recipe in the detail. I don't think that 12-15 minutes  is enough to bake it. mine came out awful, way to gooey and sticky. I was hoping that'll get better once they cool off but I was wrong. They all ended up in the trash.

I needed a gluten free vegan version so I made the following changes--5 1/2 cups unsweetened coconut, 2/3 cup Pamela's Gluten Free dairy free flour,  11.5 oz canned sweetened condensed coconut milk, 3.5 oz water, 2 teaspoons almond extract, 1/4 teaspoon salt.  Mix, chill for 30 minutes, cook at 330 for 30 minutes.  The flavor is great.  I used coconut oil on the cookie sheet and they did not stick.  Be sure to pack them firmly.  One fell apart and I had to eat it!   They stored well and the flavor developed even further.  I think the water made them more crunchy on the outside and tender inside.

simple and easy!  i made one change to this recipe...i added 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1 teaspoon of almond extract instead of all vanilla.
the tip suggested by others that you put it in the fridge for about 10 minutes before making into balls was very helpful too...otherwise its a bit of a sticky mess  :)   
i cooked on foil and that was a bit of a chore scrapping them off...next time i might try spraying the pan first instead.  Id also like to try drizzling some melted chocolate on top next time too...though it doesnt need it :)
took these to a holiday party, and they were gobbled up quickly :)   i will definitely make these again!  Thank you!

I made no changes alto I think I'll try almond extract next time.  But oh my no fuss and they came out great.  6 stars for the ease and taste  I used sweetened flaked coconut. and I agree silicone sheets or parchment paper is great, less clean up.

Overall, easy to make and bake and tasty. However, do NOT use foil to line the pan unless you use a cooking spray. I used this recipe and split it into 3 bowls, also added a different food coloring to each bowl and various sprinkles on top before baking and they are a festive treat for Christmas.

They were pretty good but not great.  I had never made macaroons before but I may try a different recipe next time.  Made it exactly as the recipe called for.

Super easy to make and only a few ingredients. Very tasty and quick to make. Don't overcook though. Once you see them start to get brown take them out.

These are very good, sweet and chewy. I followed the recipe as written. Watch them carefully in the oven and take them out when slightly brown, otherwise; they will get too brown on the bottom. Mine took 10 minutes in a convection oven.

Easy, easy, easy and so delicious. I've made these several times and they have become a favorite at home and at parties. They are great made as is, but there are some easy options if you want to change it up a bit. I've used almond extract instead of vanilla; I've drizzled them with melted chocolate and I've even stuffed them with a chocolate covered almond before baking. Lots of ways to sup them up if you are in the mood! Just a quick note,  I do tend to cook them for a few minutes longer so that they are evenly browned.

These were soooo easy and very delicious!   I did however combine two recipes, sort of..... I added 3 egg whites, to which I added the vanilla, then I beat it to make soft peaks.  Next I gently folded the egg whites into the cocoanut mixture, then put it all in the fridge to chill for a couple of hours.  This made it easier for the batter to hold together on the cookie sheet while baking.  I baked them at 375 for about 15 minutes, or until golden.  Be careful, they are very addicting!!!

Fast, fun, easy...  I used UN-sweetened shredded coconut, baked on 300 for 25 min.  I think 23 min might have been better.  They are still soft inside and golden outside.  No refrigeration.  Sweet enough just from the condensed milk, I think.

This is a great recipe for coconut lovers. If you only mildly like coconut, I recommend that you go find a different recipe. Personally, I loved them. They are rich in flavor and are amazing. Uses a LOT of coconut, though. Could it be a little less?

These were my first attempt at macaroons and they turned out fantastic!! They went flying off the plate at my son's party. I used the convection bake setting on 300F for 25 minutes. This was perfect advice from someone else on this site. It allowed them to slow cook and crisp/brown to perfection. I also used parchment paper on a cookie sheet, lightly sprayed with olive oil cooking spray.

First time ever making macaroons, I got many great compliments at Easter dinner on these. However I felt the baking time wasn't quite on and they need to be formed into more of a ball without pieces of coconut sticking out so the edges come out properly, otherwise quick and tasty. may add a bit of almond extract next time.

I used a large cookie scoop which yielded 32 cookies.  I tried a few suggestions one:  I refrigerated the dough for an hour before putting them on the baking sheet...that seemed to work.  two:  I tried reducing the heat and baking longer as per suggestions but wound up cranking it back up to 350 as per the recipe.  I dipped in dark chocolate also.  I have never made macaroons before and I think they came out amazing.  Thank you for the recipe I will be making them again

This recipe tasted great, although I didn't think that they were the normal texture of a macaroon.  I followed the recipe exactly, and they were very yummy.

Just made these to add to my Christmas cookie gifts this past year. I'm not a fan of macaroons, so I was unable to judge them myself. However, I got crazy rave reviews on them from absolutely everyone to whom I gave them. I will be making these every year!

I followed the recipe exactly and they are wonderful.  These cookies are very sweet so be warned. If you have children offer them one if you have grandchildren give them a few and then send them home.  I highly recommend these cookies if you love coconut. I will make them again.

I thought they'd be better. They were hard on the outside and gooey on the inside. They tasted like condensed milk. I won't make these again.

I have used this recipe over 30 times.  It is my go-to and should be followed as-is.  If you want to jazz it up you can dip the bottoms, once cooled, in melted chocolate chips.  So easy and so tasty.  Even my non-coconut lover friends are addicted and ask for the recipe.

I was looking for a straightforward coconut macaroon that tasted sweet,  dense, moist and chewy. THIS IS IT! Doesn't even have eggs, either! Great pantry cookie. I thought the condensed milky flavor complimented the coconut fabulously. I did read a lot of reviews about  using sweetened flaked coconut but I used 3 cups unsweetened + 2.5 cups sweetened and still found it to be really sweet. Might use all unsweetened next time. I also added 1/4 cup slivered almonds which gave it a very nice subtle crunch, and decreased extracts to 1/2 tsp each vanilla and almond and found that to be just right and not cloying while letting coconut flavor shine through. Great, easy, kid-friendly and craving-friendly recipe!

My friends loved it, but I had to leave them in the oven for a bit longer then it said. They tasted Amazing! =D Also, instead of vanilla extract i used coconut extract. The can of condensed milk i used was 4 ounce less, but all turned out well ^.^

It was ok but  coconut macaroons are one of my favorite cookies and these do not taste at all like the coconut macaroons I am used to. I don't like the taste of the condensed milk in them and they need an egg white and butter  or something else in them. I won't be saving these.

The whole family loved it even those who don't like coconut. I made it exactly as directed. This recipe has a lot of potential you could definitely have fun with it adding toppings and making it your own.

These weren't spectacular, but they were okay. My biggest issue was that I used wax paper. The cookies stuck to it so much that the paper was attached to the bottom of the cookies and I had to spend a great deal of time trying to get it off, with a few casualties along the way. I do like how simple thenough recipe is though.

These are GREAT! And easy to make. After they baked and cooled I put them in the fridge for a while, then dipped the bottoms in melted chocolate and set on parchment paper. Back in the fridge to set, and they were perfect for packaging and giving away for Christmas.

Excellent!  Used a 15oz. bag of flaked coconut and it was the perfect amount.  After reading all the reviews, I incorporated the teaspoon of vanilla extract and teaspoon of almond extract into the sweetened condensed milk before adding to coconut mixture.  I used a Pampered Chef small scoop and a knife to even off the bottom.  Made the process much easier and not messy at all!  They were the perfect size once baked and I was able to get 31 macaroons from this recipe!  Will be making it again.

Wonderful and easy recipe.  I have also added almond extract for a coup,e of batches.  To make them gluten free, I used coconut flour with success.  Since coconut flour is more dense than wheat flour, reduce the amount to barely half a cup.

These were a big hit with my family!  The only adjustment I made was to use 1 teaspoon each of vanilla and almond extract.  Very easy to make and very fast!  I definitely recommend using parchment paper.  No problem with them sticking to the cookie sheet,  I just slid the parchment off onto a cooling rack and put another piece on the cookie sheet for the next batch!

Moist and delicious. These turned out better than macaroons I buy from the bakery. They are messy but simple to make. I mailed several tins worth to family which took about a week and got good reports on how they tasted and held together.

Wonderful recipe. They taste and look like much more effort than they take. I added a half a teaspoon of almond extract and drizzled dark chocolate on top of them. They were a huge hit.

I can honestly say that I had never tried a coconut macaroon before so I wasn't sure what to expect- I'm glad I took a chance on this recipe!  I did add a tsp of almond extract and bake on parchment paper.  Crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and delicious throughout!  Between the sweetened condensed milk and the sweetened coconut these were extremely sweet, I think next time I might stick with unsweetened coconut.

These were really good holiday cookies.  I am currently in the process of making my third batch in the last 10 days.  The ones I made for Christmas I halved some red and green maraschino cherries and pushed into the centers.  I always give the 'dough' about 45 minutes in the fridge before spooning out the cookies.  They seem to stay fluffier.  Very good basic recipe.

I think I will keep looking for a coconut macaroon recipe. This one tasted bland and just had no wow factor. Do not use a ice cream scoop! Just  ball up a rounded teaspoon full. The ice cream scoop made HUGE cookies.  I am going to drizzle these in dark chocolate in hopes to salvage these.

Delicious!.  So easy to make. The only change I made was substituting  almond extract for the vanilla since I did not have enough. I added a semi-sweet chocolate chip on top of each mound because we love the coconut-chocolate combination. Will be making it again. Thanks for sharing.

Way too sweet! Which coming from me says a lot because I have a sweet tooth. Also golf ball size are too big. Maybe ping pong ball size would be better.

Awesome, easy recipe.  They came out perfect, and I have had challenges with other macaroon recipes in the past.  Parchment paper is a must, even if using a baking stone.  This one is a keeper!

Excellent cookies! Extremely easy to make and a crowd pleaser. Instead of using my hands to mix, I used my kitchen aid mixer with the whisk attachment.  I have gotten so many rave reviews on these cookies.

It doesn't get much easier or more delicious than this recipe for macaroons! I bake mine at 325 for a longer period which works great for me. The only changes I make to the ingredients are to occasionally add a bit of almond extract for a deliciously different taste and to always drizzle some melted, semi-sweet chocolate over the tops of the cooled macaroons. Yum, yum, yum!!!

I made these for Christmas for the first time. My husband loves coconut, so I thought I would give these a try. Well all I can say is I couldn't be more happy with them. The only thing I changed was I did was 1 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 1/2 tsp of almond extract. My husband wouldn't let me give any away and he hid them. Now I need to make more, and hide them from him so I can give them away. This recipe was so easy to make, and they are done in no time. I would highly recommend making them, you can't go wrong! Thank you for the recipe.

I looked at reviews and decided to adapt. I used 2 egg whites - whips up better in a large bowl. Added the coconut first 1 bag of 200 gm and flavourings and then the sweet milk can. Needed another 1/2 bag coconut to be good and lumpy and not liquid. Great flour-less recipe for those who can't take flour. This does not need refrigeration. Ice cream scoop works on a floured large cookie sheet. Closer to 20 minutes cooking time in a gas oven for that slightly pink cooked look. Cool as stated and peel off the foil - or can use metal spatula.  My guys love it.

I followed it exactly and they were very dry and burnt at 12 minutes. I reduced the time for the second batch, they didn't burn but were very dry still. I will try a different recipe next time.

I made this recipe for a cookie exchange.  The only change I made was adding almond flavoring along with the vanilla (1/2 vanilla, 1/2 almond) and adding 2 egg whites.  They turned out great!  I used a scoop about the size of a golf ball but mine took about 20 min. at 350 degrees to get toasted.  I will make these again!

Super easy! I made these for a cookie exchange at work and everyone LOVED them!  I shaped them into little pointy triangles and dipped the tips in melted chocolate.   I made one minor change: I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract.  This will be my "go to" macaroon recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I  improve these by placing 1 or 2 almonds on top before cooking (depending on the size) and dipping in chocolate

Made these & brought them to work. They said they were the best they ever had. Made recipes exactly as listed, but at the end I dipped half of them in melted dark chocolate. Delicious!

Make sure if youre using aluminium foil, spray it with oil! I made the mistake of leaving my boyfriend in charge of shaping them and putting them on the cookie sheet while i made a raspberry reduction to dip instead of chocolate. He made them so huge they didn't cook/toast all the way through, and then stuck to the foil. Needless to say, we had to scrape off the remaining coconut mixture and recook  them about golfball size. After that everything was a go!!

Luckily I halved this recipe because these were not worth the time and money they took to make.   Bland, hard and dense, these are not real macaroons.

Yes, excellent!  I used almond extract instead of vanilla and baked them on a silicone baking sheet.  As good as the ones we remember Mom making!

Great - simple - fast. I made them about 1/2 a tablespoon in size - much smaller than directed. Baked 8-10 minutes (watched to see when a little brown around the edges). I used unsweetened coconut. Those who are lovers of coconut – LOVED THESE!

Didn't care for the taste of these. The evaporated milk overpowers the flavor of the coconut. The Betty Crocker recipe using egg whites produces a light textured and flavorful cookie. Will not make these again.

Loved it.  We push  an almond into the center of the cookie before baking and dip the bottom in chocolate when it has cooled.   Definitely a make again recipe.

I was disaappointed in this recipe.  The cookies were ok but not great.  They lacked the richness that I was trying to achieve.  They were simple and quick to make but I probably I need a recipe made with whipped egg white to get the richness I desire.

These were amazing!  I doubled the recipe, which worked very well. Also used a little more vanilla than called for because I love vanilla. They also took a little longer than stated in my oven. SO SO good, easy, and versatile. Next time I will dip some in chocolate

OMG- these are soooooo good!  They are more like candy than a cookie- chewy, very sweet.  Yes, you can taste the condensed milk, but in a good way.  There are two great textures going on- crunchy on the outside, and so chewy inside.  They do soften up slightly when put into a container, but retain a wonderful exterior.  If I could give more than five stars, I would.

I absolutely HEART this recipe. I've literally made hundreds and hundreds of them during the past 2 years and have gotten nothing but compliments. I will make them again for my kiddos' school's teachers' Christmas cookie exchange. To make them a little more festive, I sprinkle green and red sanding sugar BEFORE I bake them and after they've cooled, I dip the bottom in melted chocolate.  Yum. Yum. Yum.

A helpful tip is only use half-three quarters of the ice cream scoop and then round it a little with your hands. I really like this recipe! It is extremely easy to make. If your 9 year old knows his/her way around the kitchen they will be easy peasy to make. I started making my dad these every year for his birthday about 3 years ago.

Delicious! I used sweetened coconut and followed the recipe exactly. I baked for 15 mins and they came out perfect, especially with an added drizzle of chocolate. I used a tablespoon measuring spoon sprayed with olive oil to scoop and it made perfect sized round bites! This recipe made 38 for me.

These were delish! I added the teaspoon of almond extract and vanilla...mixed with condensed milk as other reviewers mentioned . My hubby has diverticulitis and his doctors said for him to eat two or three macaroons daily..wonderful results and these have no preservatives...I will be making these all the time...great recipe..I will make them smaller next time..I got two dozen huge macaroons..blue ribbon for sure!

Just great, they where soft but still held a shape. I added 1.5 cups of slivered almonds and dipped them in white chocolate after they cooled.

These are a hit every time! I chill them for an hour as others suggested, and use a Tbsp to scoop them.

This recipe is amazing! The only thing I changed was using a little less coconut flakes since the package only contain 5 1/3 cups instead of the recommend 5 1/2 cups. Brought a batch to my husbands company party and they were a hit!

About as easy as you get. I wore gloves and ran my hands under cold water once to make the cookie formation and clean-up simple. We melted some chocolate chips with coconut oil to drizzle on top. Yum!

This recipe gets 5 stars from me and I hate coconut. I made these for my dad for Fathers Day because he loves macaroons and I had a bite to test the texture of one... it was AMAZING. I could eat the whole batch. They are super easy and quick to make. About as foolproof as a recipe gets.

Delicious! I fashioned a chocolate topping by melting chocolate and adding a tablespoon or so of Crisco, which makes it softer.

Fast, easy, and super addictive! I've tried several other macaroon recipes and this one is my husband's favorite. It made two dozen ping pong ball sized cookies. Much easier than trying to whip egg whites to the perfect consistency. Stir, scoop, bake, that's it!

Five ingredients, 3 steps. My brother said 'What??? You didn't have to beat an egg forever to make this??' Perfect consistency, followed this recipe to a T. Melted some dark chocolate chips 30 seconds at a time in the microwave, then put it into a ziplock bag, cut the tip off and drizzled it over them.  Awesome!  Took a lot longer than 15 minutes to cook - almost 30 until the coconut tips began to toast....

They are delicious. Do not overbake and I used parchment paper at the bottom on the cookie sheet. Made them quite a bit smaller than the recipe called for so 1 batch made at least 50 cookies. Put a quartered piece of maraschino cherry on each one to dress them up. Will make again and again!

This recipe is easy and just perfect to follow! Thanks for sharing! I did just one change because I am trying to cook without regular flour. I used buckwheat flour and my macarrones are still delicious. They are darker than regular macarroons but taste yumiiiiiiii.

Exactly what coconut macaroons should be and so easy (though messy) to make.  BTW, this recipe made 19 macaroons for me, not the dozen claimed.  They baked for the full 15 minutes.  Also, I had to push each ball together in the ice cream scoop and once on the baking sheet in order for them to stay together.  I was mostly successful. Maybe next time I'll take another reviewer's advice and refrigerate the dough before molding and baking.  A final note: I mixed the condensed milk and vanilla together before adding the mixture to the coconut.

I have never made macaroons before, but after having these, we will be making them again. They were fantastic. We drizzled dark chocolate over some of them. They were delicious either way. We made them from fresh coconut, which I imagine makes them that much tastier.

I loved these & made them gluten free by substituting "Gluten Free Mama's Coconut blend" flour and 1/2 tsp of xanthum gum - they were wonderful! I also refrigerated the dough for an hour prior to baking.

This is a very simple yet very delicious macaroons. Definitely chilled for about 2 hours making it easy shaping them. having a tsp of vanilla extract & a tsp of almond extract is a very good combo so thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

I don't know how these turned out so poorly!
I followed the recipe, followed advice from users, but in the end the macaroons were still quite raw in the middle and burnt on the bottom (I timed them for 10mins). I won't be using this recipe again.

5 stars bkz: taste, one-bowl prep & the compliments. I chose to make these a regular size and the batch makes about 3 dozen.  I adjusted the temp to 300 for 12 minutes. I also slightly upped the flour to 3/4 cup. You can grease & then flour sheet if you don't have parchment paper.

Easy to make.  A bit too sweet with sweetened coconut.  We liked them better on the second day.  The sweetened condensed milk is perhaps too dominant.  Next time I'll try a different macaroons recipe (one that doesn't rely so heavily on sweetened condensed milk).

I made this last night and followed the recipe exactly.  Loved the flavor, texture, and especially how quick and easy this was to put together.  I used a small ice cream scoop and the recipe yielded exact 24 cookies.  I baked them for a cookie exchange and I could keep my husbands hands off them.  He suggested I add roasted almonds and drizzle with chocolate so we'll have homemade Almond Joy Cookies.  Hmmm, maybe next time.  Great recipe without any changes!

This was my first time making macaroons.  They turned out great.  I read through reviews and incorporated a few of the suggestions.  I split the flavoring between vanilla and almond and chilled them prior to baking.  Chilling certainly helps with the mixture not being as sticky and makes it much easier to work with.  I baked them on wax paper, just a reminder that you need to remove them from the wax paper right away after coming out of the oven, otherwise the paper sticks to the bottom.  I had something come up when a batch came out which required me setting them aside a moment and coming back, the few minutes was all it took.  I am going to make again and drizzle with chocolate on the next batch.  I am also going to try a few others, this recipe calls for flour, and I try to cook gluten free, will try making it with GF flour or a different recipe next time.

Turned out great!  Just spray the pan with Pam and go. I drizzled chocolate over them. Just beautiful and delicious!

Had these growing up but they were always brittle.  These are soft and chewy. :) thanks!

Followed the recipe and added BOTH vanilla and the tsp of almond extract. Used a ice cream scoop to keep the "balls" uniform in shape.

update 12/22/16: *I wanted to try these again for my holiday trays and the first batch was just a tad too dark and a bit crunchy.  I decided to turn the oven temp down to 325 and they tasted so much better.  since going back and reading some of the reviews, I see others achieve better results with a 325 oven.  My oven is calibrated correctly using an oven thermometer so I know it is not a case of my oven being too hot.* these are very good and very quick and easy with just a few ingredients; can be stirred up in no time.  I guess I was expecting a more cake-like macaroon.  these are almost a cross between a cookie and candy.  very good all the same.

Hello while on vacation in Maui a tropical storm was approaching so we were not able to go out and explore the island so I decided to bake these.  These were easy but very sticky.  I did use the sweetened flake coconut and had to use a total of 21 oz of coconut.  Some have said they only needed 14 oz bag.  When making the golf size balls with my hand I used the technique of dipping fingers from one hand into warm water so that I could roll the dough into shape.

A really tasty and simple treat to make. It was good, but it didn't have the texture I was expecting it to have. I was hoping for a more cake like macaroon.

I agree with Tami.  It was a little...weird.  Good flavor, but not the texture I was hoping for.  Maybe I needed to bake them a little longer???  I liked the crunchy/chewy pieces on the outside but not the "raw" center.  At least my husband loved them!

It's great! I used sweetened flaked coconut.
 You don't have t use an ice cream scoop to spoon them.
Use a round tablespoon. When you scoop with the round tablespoon,
Make it overfull.

Excellent macaroons.  But to all my fellow Canadians, just note that our cans of sweetened condensed milk, are only 300ml, which is 10oz., not 14.

These were great.  I made them for Valentines Day for my macaroon-loving hubby and added some red food coloring to the condensed milk to turn them pink.  (I also dyed my hands red, so use gloves if you combine the ingredients by hand!)  I spelled I LOVE YOU with chocolate chips on top.  Great recipe for any special occasion since they accept food coloring very well!

I made these last night and they're the best macaroons I've ever had. I spent a long time looking for the perfect recipe and this is it. I've tried at leave half a dozen other recipes including the ones with egg whites, but none are this good. I brought them to work and all my coworkers were going crazy over them. I wish I had used parchment paper instead of foil, but that was my only difficulty.

These are fabulous!  I used gluten free flour mix with 1 tsp xantham gum, unsweetened coconut, added 2/3 cup white sugar, used 1 tsp almond flavouring and 1 tsp vanilla, and used a tablespoon measure to form the macaroons into small balls before baking.  I ended up with about about 50 macaroons and they are delicious - not too sweet and with a wonderful toasted coconut taste.

The original recipe said the yield would be 12, and I figured that would't be enough. So,I increased the recipe by 50% (figuring I'd get 18 cookies. I used a golfball sized ice cream scoop, and got 40 cookies. Baked them 12 minutes. They are excellent.

This recipe was wonderful!  I doubled it and it made 42 using a golf ball size icecream scoop.  By the way, I prefer mine with semi-sweet chocolate chips so I added them as I was mixing the milk/vanilla mixture into the flour/salt/coconut mixture.  They turned out great!  I did follow other reviews and added just a touch of almond extract, but I do not think it would be necessary, just a matter of what you like.  Great recipe and I will definitely make it again!

Great cookie!  I tried two different recipes and this one won out.  I did add three egg whites (beaten to a peak) just because other recipes used whites and I had hem left from a different recipe.  Super moist, next batch I'm going to add an almond on top and dunk in dark chocolate.   Best ofthe bunch.

Pretty easy/quick. I halved the recipe and got probably 20 golf ball sized cookies. Followed the recipe, except used a splash of vanilla & almond extracts. Also, some reviews recommended putting the dough in the fridge, and I thought I should have since the dough started getting stickier and stickier, but after making them, I realized the ones that didn't look like nice and clean were much prettier and yummier (since the ends that stuck out were nice and crunchy).

Loved! Followed recipe exactly. These taste just like the inside of a Mounds or Almond Joy candy bar. Perfect for dipping in chocolate fondue or fountain, which is what we used them for. It was everyone's favorite dipper!

I get rave reviews every time I make these cookies...even more so if I stir in some chocolate chips!

Update - I make these cookies several times a year, but I make many batches during the holidays. I have switched from stirring in chocolate chips to making them without the chocolate chips and then dipping the bottoms in chocolate. They look elegant and taste just as good!

These things are simply AMAZING. Every person I've had try them has told me they are the best coconut macaroons they've ever had! Something that's also really good is using unsweetened coconut and drizzling with chocolate. I would give this 10/10 if I could, great recipe!

Easiest cookie to make. Serving size must be huge if this recipe only serves 12.  I made decent size ones (3 bites) and came out with 30 or so.....But super quick, even though I'm not a fan of these in general, these were ok and my go to cookie for Christmas exchanges since they take almost ZERO time to prepare, just baking time. Easy Peasy. I did refrigerate the mixture once completed though, half hour did the trick, and kept putting it back in between bakes...

These taste exactly like Almond Joy candy bars if you add 2 cups of chopped almonds (pea-sized bits) and half a bag of mini chocolate chips.  Be sure to run the coconut through the food processor, to get rid of that stringy texture.  I also drizzle them in melted chocolate to make them pretty.  Everyone loves these and requests I make them!

Absolutely AMAZING!  Since this was my first time making macaroons, I followed the recipe exactly as written, and baked for 15 minutes, preparing to cook a couple more minutes - if need be - in order to ensure they were "toasted" (because that is what I wanted) ... but they were PERFECT after 15 minutes!  My daughter and I LOVED them and could have easily eaten more, if we did not MAKE ourselves stop eating after a couple!

This is a great easy recipe one I remember making when I was young.  One problem unfortunatly there was no mention to grease the pan which meant ALL my cookies stuck to the foil.  either put it right on a greased cookie sheet or greased foil or you will waste a lot of expensive coconut.

Simple and delicious indeed. This took me maybe half an hour to make, not counting the 15 minutes of baking. I tried only one as I made them for this Friday, and the one I tried was delicious. happily I still have enough of every ingredient to make more.

Beyond super simple and the best macaroons I've ever tasted.

Due to high altitude (7770 ft), added a bit extra flour and baked the same temp/time on Convection.

Next time I'm using a hint by another user and refrigerating the dough to make balling the macaroons a bit easier.

Lastly, I yielded 18 gems ^^

I just made these today and they are delicious.   Read the suggestion to add almond extract, but I didn't have any so I used 1/2 tsp coconut extract.  Mmmmmm...I will keep this recipe and won't use another for macaroons...there's simply no need!

Excellent - I also followed the suggestions and did 1 tsp. vanilla and 1 of almond extract. Planning to dip in chocolate today and see how that comes out! Even my semi-picky boyfriend who isn't a big cookie person loved these.

This recipe is great! I did do a couple things differently though.. I food processed the flaked coconut. It made it a little bit easier to chew and gave it a nicer texture.. Also, I was craving Mounds, so I added some chopped up semi-sweet morsels (about a 1/2 cup) into the mix. My husband LOVED them and he is not usually a big fan of coconut macaroons. This recipe is definitely a keeper

Good reason they won 1st place.  They ROCK!!!  Like many folks, my sister always makes cookies during the holidays.  I do too but they're usually just Chocolate with PB Chips or plain ol' Chocolate Chip.  Sis always makes stuff my dad likes and brags that he likes her cookies over mine.  Macaroons aren't really thought of as a Christmas cookie but Dad thinks so now.  :O)  Everyone loved them and Sis took the backseat this year.  Thank you so much!!!  I've made approximately 20 dozen since last Christmas.

Super easy to make!!! I followed the advice of others and added one tsp of almond extract to the sweetened condensed milk. Also I placed it in the refrigerator for an hour.  I have a convection oven so I reduced the heat to 300 and baked them a full 15minutes. My husband LOVED them!!! thank you for sharing.

Maybe it's me, but this one is going down as one of my kitchen disasters.  Not only did they taste bad (probably the old-a$$ coconut), but they came out unrecognizable as coconut macaroons.  My boyfriend actually spit it out asking me what the main ingredient was.  i said 'coconut' and he asked,"No. What's this gooey bready stuff?"

Super easy and really good! I followed the recipe exactly except that I also drizzled melted chocolate on the top. Made them for my dad who is a huge coconut fan and he loved them.

Best and easiest macaroon recipe I have tried yet. I followed the recipe with the exception of throwing in some chocolate chips just for fun. They were so yummy. I can't stay out of them! And I didn't have parchment paper. Just make sure to spray your cookie sheet well if you want them to come off easy.

pretty good. Very easy to make. I used a ice cream scoop and just buttered my baking sheet and I didnt have much of a sticking problem. They're very moist and not super sweet. The coconut stays very soft (i used the bag coconut). My boyfriend ate 4 right out of the oven and hes not that crazy bout coconut, said they were one of the best things he's ever eaten. I dont know if I'd go that far but they're good! :)

made a lot more than 12 servings, I made about 25 of them! and they all came out crispy outside and soft on the inside. I also added a melted semi sweet chocolate and skim milk mixture glaze as a drizzle. I used sweetened coconut and followed all what reviewers recommended. Everyone loved them even the coconut haters converted!

So simple and so incredibly good!  I couldn't believe how quickly these came together and how delicious they tasted.  I think next time I make these I will go ahead and cook them for a bit longer to toast the coconut more.  I may even try dipping them in chocolate as others have done.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous recipe!  EASY...except for the fact that I used wax paper instead of parchment or foil.  Took me longer to peel the paper off them than to actually mix and bake :(

I made these exactly as the recipe calls for, and I couldn't believe how quick and easy they were to make.  And the result was soft, moist, chewy, delicious cookies.  I used tin foil to line my pan, and they did stick a bit, but I found if I let them cool about 15 minutes on the foil then used a spatula to scrape them off, they came off pretty easily.  I liked them plain and also drizzled with some melted chocolate.  I scooped them with a T measuring spoon, and it made about 2 1/2 dozen  smaller cookies.  Great recipe!

I had high hopes for these cookies because they sounded great and even when I made them the dough was pretty good and it had a nice firm texture to shape easily and it held its shape while cooking. The main reason why I do not like them is how they baked and tasted after. I tried 3 batches each baking at different amounts of time and they took a very long time to get the center fully cooked and by the time it was cooked on the inside it was overcooked on the outside. When I tasted them they werent too bad if you like a gooey super sweet and kinda odd texture to your cookies. Not gooey like chocolate chip cookies but kinda off putting for sure. I was looking for more of a classic macaroon cookie that are chewy.

These were great. When I started making them I realized I did not have any vanilla flavoring so I skeptically used almond flavoring. Wow, very good! I gave to some friends and they suggested putting chocolate on top and creating the Almond Joy effect... I think I'm gonna try!

Very good and easy, especially since it was my first time making them.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and added 1/2 tsp of almond extract.  I think I cooked it too close to the bottom of the oven because the bottom was too brown, but my parents were highly impressed.  Adding a chocolate drizzle on top makes them fantastic!

Not the exact recipe I had hoped it would be. FYI for anybody making these, they are REALLY sweet. Like the chewiness though.

This was a HUGE hit! I had to make something for the bf's grandparents and strayed away from macaroons thinking it'd be hard. After a failed cookie attempt, made this and EVERYONE loved it. Thanks!

Very simple recipe but not what I am looking for in a macaroon.  Tasted just like the ingredients.  I will look for a more complex recipe that will hopefully yield a more complex and tasty product.

Why buy macaroons when these are so easy to make? I use shredded instead of flaked coconut and dip them in melted chocolate when cooled. I find they take a little longer to toast in my oven.

These were awesome!! I am an avid baker and my first time making macaroons... so easy!!! I used wet fingers and dry... I liked dry a litte more.. just texture. I cannot wait to make these again and try out different centers.. chocolate drizzle... they were the hit of Easter dinner!!! I made exactly as the recipe called for..

this recipe is easy, fast and delicious.  i added just 1/2 tsp almond extract for added zing to these cookies.  I highly recommend them.  The recipe def-initely takes the full 15 mins to bake up.

This is now my go-to for macaroons.  They held together unlike many other recipes I've tried and were wonderfully toasted on the outside and chewy in the middle.  One thing I always do is whip the milk with the extract for about 3-5 minutes while I'm prepping the other ingredients.  This adds to the fluffy texture and the base never melts into a 'foot' while baking.  I also always dip the base of these in dark chocolate.  The bitter chocolate off sets the sweet macaroon perfectly.

I gave one star for the coconut flavor (even though I had to add 1 tsp almond extract), one star for the consistency and the fact that the balls did not flatten out, and a final (or third) star for precise baking time quoted of 16 minutes.  However, I did take away one star for the density of the macaroons, being that I have tried store bought macaroons that have been fluffy and light in terms of density and not as sticky as this one.  I took away a second star dur to the fact that I DO NOT LIKE EATING PARCHMENT PAPER!!! THE MACAROONS STUCK LIKE GLUE TO THE PARCHMENT PAPER. NEXT BATCH I WILL TRY TO USE SOME COOKING SPRAY DIRECTLY ON THE BAKING SHEET AND NOOOO PARCHMENT PAPER!

These were very easy to make! I used utensils instead of my hands, so it wasn't as messy. Might try dipping them in chocolate next time. I just wish they were a little sweeter.

OH so easy and very good!  I have no modifications...I just mixed by hand in a 10 cup measuring bowl.  I did use my small cookie scoop to put these on the baking sheet.  I didn't have parchment, but used foil and it wasn't TOO bad for sticking.  My only recommendation is to not have them be as large as golf balls...to me the star of a macaroon is the toasted coconut, so I made these about the size of a large walnut.  They are great!

Outstanding! The only adjustment that I made was 1 tsp vanilla,and 1 tsp almond extract. I used a cookie scoop (sprayed first with Pam) and all were shaped beautiful! Using my silpat, there were no sticking problems. After baking and cooling, I drizzle with 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (microwave 1 min. 15 sec). Recipe yielded 30 cookies; baked for 16 minutes. WOW - so awesome! Great for gift giving or taking to a party.

I made these for my mother-in-law, as she is a supreme coconut lover!  First of all, these were easy to make.  I used a silicone mat on a baking sheet and the macaroons didn't stick at all and the bottoms were lightly browned.  More importantly, my mother-in-law has not stopped raving about these.  She actually said these are the best she has ever had.  I melted a chocolate bar and a few drops of light corn syrup in a ziploc bag, then cut the corner and drizzled chocolate over the tops.  I have never been much of a coconut fan, but I have to say, these were delicious and addictive.  I'm glad I sent the majority of them to her.  I plan on making these again and again for my mother-in-law and anyone else who loves coconut macaroons.  The ingredient list was so simple.  How could you go wrong?

all I can say about this recipe is OMG DELICIOUS! I have never had a macaroon that was anything special but my kids wanted some so we made these.  I let one batch go a bit long in the oven and they were even better that way with the nicely carmelized bottoms.  These will be a staple in our house from now on. Thank you!

Followed the recipe with the exception that I took some advice I read in the reviews and used 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1 teaspoon almond extract. Even if I hadn't done that, I still think they would have been great. An easy, quick, and very tasty recipe.

I'm not much of a cocnut fan but boy oh boy are these good!!!!!  I made mine smaller and managed to get 4 dozen out of the batch.  Cooked for 9 minutes...I also dipped the bottoms of the cookies in melted semi-sweet chocolate...I didn't have any problem with the cookies sticking as I used parchament paper and sprayed it with Pam.

Great recipe!  Easy to make, tastes good!  I used homemade condensed milk, vanilla and almond extracts.

An instant tradition!  These are beautiful and wonderfully delicious.  My first batch tended to want to burn on some of the flakes before the rest of the cookies browned, so I reduced the heat to 325 and the next batch was perfect.  Like many reviewers, I did a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of almond extract.  I also made mine a bit smaller and topped them half of a candied cherry right out of the oven.  I used a metal ice cream scoop and sprayed it with cooking spray every 5th or so cookie and it worked like a charm.  Not sure why folks have had trouble with them sticking - these came right off the parchment paper with no problem whatsoever.  Excellent recipe, Fratcook, thanks so much for sharing!

Awesome! The easiest macaroons I've ever made. I followed some other suggestions and went with 1 tsp. almond extract and 1 tsp. vanilla. It gave them a wonderful, almost amaretto flavor. So good!

An absolutely fabulous recipe! I think these are the best macaroons I've ever had. I split the amount of vanilla extract with almond extract. I also put mini chocolate chips in half the batch! Delish!

Great Macaroons and super easy to make.  I thought it was going to be too sweet with the sweetened coconut flakes and the condensed milk but it wasn't at all.  As previous reviews stated, I left them in the oven for an aditional 10 minutes so that they could get golden and toasted.  Decorated them with cocolate swirls and stars and they look almost professional!! :)  Great holiday gift

These taste AWESOME but im soo dissapointed I used parchment paper as stated and every single macaroon stuck and the bottoms ripped off, so although they are VERYY tasty they look too ugly to put out with all the other baking for christmas guests...soo dissapointed!

Amazing! 14 oz. bag makes 5 1/2 c. I've got to try parchment paper next time because aluminum foil just got to stuck to every single one and made it such a pain to peel off. But even so, the macaroons were worth the extra battle with the foil because they are so delicious. Definitely a keeper!

These came out fantastic! I did have a problem with them sticking to the wax paper though. I will try these again and try greasing the wax paper with spray.

This was a very easy recipe.  I added 2 TBLS of fresh lime juice and 2 TBLS of lime zest.  They were a hit!  I liked this recipe so much more than the recipes that call for egg.  The condensed milk made them very sweet and rich.

A half hour ago a found this recipe... 5 min ago I pulled the first batch out of the oven!  How simple is that??  Besides being super easy, they are THE BEST Coconut Macaroons ever in the history of Macaroons! :)  ( I had to try one right away!!)  I took advice from a reviewer and greased and floured the baking sheet and it worked like a charm.  (I have a very thin spatula and removed the cookies right away from the hot sheet)  I made them golf ball size and it made 12 on one sheet and still have half of the mixture left over, so looks like it will yield far more that a dozen. I would not monkey around with this recipe, it is far too good!

Spectacular.  My wife and I made these along with some fudge and toffee for our wedding favors.  They were a huge hit, and quite easy to make in large quantities.  I'm not even a huge fan of coconut, but they were beyond delicious.

I made these to send to my husband, but my Mother and sister came over before they were boxed up, so the first batch didn't make it.  They were soooo good, and very easy to make.  My grandmother kept asking my mom where I learned to bake, and she replied "allrecipes.com"

Very tasty macaroons and super easy with minimal number of ingredients. I used an insulated cookie sheet and took them off while they were still warm and didn't have any trouble. I still want a slightly more cakey macaroon but I will definitely make these yummy ones again because of great coconut flavor and so easy to make.

The flavor, the texture, everyone I tried to pawn them off on hated it.  Maybe I did something wrong, but I'm pretty sure I followed the exact recipe.  Will never make these again.

So good!  I've made this recipe about 10 times. I've even used reduced fat condensed milk and had equally good results.  I've had a lot of people ask me for the recipe too!

I also meltetd chocolate chips in the microwave, about 1 cup, and added cornstarch for better blending.  Be careful not to burn the chocolate, it melts VERY fast. I recommend stirring it every 10 seconds or so.  I put the melted chocolate in a ziplock bag, cut a tiny bit on the end of the bag and drizzled the chocolate on the macaroon when they came out of the oven.  Then I put the cooking sheet in the fridge for about an hour.  They came out just beautiful with the chocolate!

Just made a batch of these and they were delicious.  Halved the recipe but made no other changes.  Toasty on the outside but soft on the inside, very tasty.

liked the suggestion of using half almond extract.  this gives the macaroons a delicious marzipan-like taste.

Yummy!  Dense and chewy on the inside, and toasted just enough on the outside.  I also used 1tsp vanilla and 1tsp of almond extract. It was slightly too sweet so maybe I will cut back on the scm next time. I used sweetened coconut, which was fine, but the sweetness was from the scm.

Perfect as is.  I just need a little chocolate with mine so I melted some chips and dipped the tops into the melted chocolate once the macaroons were cooled.  Scrumptious!

These are wonderful macaroons. I doubled this recipe without a hitch, and used 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond flavoring. I also added some finely chopped almonds to half the batter. If you want to shape the cookies, just get your hands wet so they don't stick. Enjoy!

Definitely easy to make and my dad liked them, which is who I made them for.  I added a quarter of a maraschino cherry to each before cooking and they turned out very pretty looking.  I will probably add a little more coconut, as they didn't fully cook all the way through, even though the edges were browned - I think they were a little too wet.  Overall, great cookie!

These are good, but yes I do agree the bakery are better.  I wanted to make more than 12 as the recipe called for.  So I tripled the recipe and wow do I have cookies until there is no more macaroons!  I also have to bake them for 17 minutes. I did use Vanilla as called for and Almond Extract... I will make again, but will not even double the recipe.  Enjoy this recipe.

So easy and so good! Next time, I will try to roll scoops of macaroon mixture in powdered sugar or flour coated hands before baking to make a more uniform shape, because some of the coconut that was sticking out of the balls was cooking a lot faster than the rest of the macaroon. I also drizzled dipping chocolate over them. All that being said... they were AMAZING!

So easy and so delicious. 
Don't make them smaller than a golfball, they get too chewy. Definitely a Christmas staple for me.

For those who are having trouble with the consistency and sweetness of the macaroons, make sure you are using condensed milk, NOT evaporated. There is a HUGE difference between the two. Evaporated milk is thinner and not near as sweet.

This is the best!  this recipe is quick and easy, I have never made macaroons before and people are just blown away by them.  The best part is not having to use eggs.  After the macaroons have cooled I melt semi sweet chocolate chips, a little butter and some milk (to make the chocolate smooth). I dip the macaroons in the chocolate and drizzle some on top, they are a hit EVERY time!

Really easy!  Added half vanilla and half almond.  It's my first baking experience and it's really easy to follow this one and it's hard to screw up.

Really good recipe.  The batter is soo sticky and i really could have sat there and ate it raw.  I know, i know, that's gross.  but they're really good.  I over cooked mine a bit so just watch out for that, my oven is terrible so probably my fault, not the recipe.  Give them a try.

Very easy to make! And they got raves at the party I went to. I didn't use parchment paper and I didn't have any problems (I have a good double-layer nonstick cookie sheet).

I like this recipe, very easy. I wish there was another recipe that was more healthy than using Condensed Sweetened milk. I am still looking for the all natural recipe with honey, egg whites and coconut. Anyone know it?

no real flavor - quite boring - i'm not sure what i'd do to it. but they are certainly not "gilchrist" macarooms.

Oh my... this recipe is too easy to make and even easier to eat.  I followed the advice of previous reviews and exchanged one tsp of almond extract for the vanilla and it was fabulous.  I let mine bake for 15 minutes so they'd be a bit crispier, too.

I added the vanilla extract to the condensed milk which makes it easier to mix evenly.  I used 2/3 unsweetened coconut and 1/3 sweetened coconut and I thought they were sweet enough.  Instead of using my fingers to form them, I spooned them into mini cupcake papers in my mini muffin tin and baked them like that.  No messy cleanup or stickiness and they peel out of the papers when you eat them with no problems!  This is an excellent recipe, exactly what I was looking for!!

This recipe was wonderful!!! I just stopped living in the dorms and i wanted to start baking...  This was my first recipe that i tried and it was great! If I can do it then anyone can.  i made a hard chocolate coating for them and dipped them and that definitely added to it.

Made these with some apricots and lime juice and they were TO DIE FOR.  Also dipped different ones in both milk and white chocolate.  I'm not sure that I will ever need to make any other dessert ever again!

The perfect macaroon. I made them bite-sized, so they're not too gooey or filling. Just right. Used half almond extract, half vanilla as suggested. Thank you for the recipe!

I made these yesterday with a house full of kids.  I dipped the bottoms in melted milk chocolate (1 bag of milk choco chips + 1/4C of lard) then drizzled the remaining chocolate on the tops just to make them pretty.  There's 2 left in my cookie jar that I'm guarding for my husband!!!

These are really good, but not the best coconut macaroons I've had.  The recipe is simple enough, I'd probably make it again if I needed some quick cookies, but I won't call off my search for the best macaroon recipe yet!

I didn't know if I was capable of doing a macaroon recipe where whipping eggs were involved, so this recipe was a great discovery! I just made them and they are AWESOME! I followed everyone's advice:

1. Mixed the wet ingredients separate from the dry.
2. Chilled in the refridgerator for 15 minutes.
3. Used cold water on my hands every so often to avoid the dough from sticking to them (the heat from my hands) when rolling the dough.
4. Substituted the 2t of vanilla extract for 1t each of vanilla and almond extract. 

I'll tell you, I was a bit scared of the almond extract at first, the smell was so powerful! But when it was all baked and cooled, there was only a hint of the almond flavoring - and I LOVED IT! I may have to cut my baking time since I didn't know when they were actually done. I ended up cooking them too long. However, they were still delicious! I can't wait to make them again! So easy and so fast!

I'm giving these macaroons 3 stars because, I made them exactly as they were in the recipe, and for the bottom I used parchment paper. DON'T USE WAX, OR PARCHMENT PAPER!! I even sprayed the paper with butter, they stuck so bad I had to throw about half of them out. I was so mad. Also, I didn't care to much for the added vanilla, you don't need it. I did add some drizzled chocolate to them at the end. They were good, but not GREAT!

These were stupid simple to make.  I made mine a bit smaller than the recommended 'golf ball' size simply because I like cookies on the small size.  Next time I make these I am planning on dipping a few of them in melted semi-sweet chocolate.

These were surprisingly yummy!  Both my husband and young daughter liked them.  I followed the direction exactly and they turned out perfectly.  I dipped the bottom of half the batch in melted chocolate and left the other half plain.  Both were excellent.  Thanks for sharing!

This is an idiot-proof recipe that produces delicious cookies.  The recipe says it yields a dozen, but both times I've made it we've gotten about 30 cookies out of a batch.  Very rich cookies, one or two will do it, so I'd rather have them a bit smaller.  Wonderful addition to the cookie jar!

This is an excellent, easy recipe.  I love macaroons and this is one of the best I've tried.  It was my first time making macarooons and these turned out perfectly.  It helps to chill the dough for a short time, but I like to not have perfectly rounded macaroons so that the coconut toasts more during baking.  Friends loved these!  I made some dipped in semi-sweet chocolate.

I used to have this recipe and had lost it. Thanks for Sharing. Very easy and fun. I used a cookie scoop and end up with about 48 good size cookies. I cook lunch for neice, nephews as well as my own kids(17 total) They enjoyed them. I added a half a bag of semi-sweet mini chocolate chips. They all said to add them to my recipe box.
 I greased one pan and not the other. I had no problem sticking, did brown the bottom but I like the toasted taste.  Thanks again for the recipe.

Wow.  This recipe is simply amazing.  I can see why it has won blue ribbons.    My husband had been requesting a coconut macaroon like his Aunt Orphie used to make and after several trials of different recipes, this is the one.  Make them small, about half the size of a ping-pong ball if you want them like Aunt Orphie's  ;  -  ).  If you want a traditional macaroon, use this recipe.  I followed it EXACTLY and the cookies came out simply perfect.  Since you have to mix them up with your hands, don't do as I did and forget to put in the vanilla until after you're up to your elbows with the "dough."  Thankfully hubby was there to help me out.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.  It's simply the best!

These were very easy to make and tasted great!  However, they are not exactly the  macaroon I was looking for.  I would make again, but maybe dip in chocolate next time.

Because I don't live in the US coconut in the form I am used to is not readily available, so bought a fresh coconut, and did the whole cutting up/shredding thing. I think this highly affected the outcome. I am sure this would be a 5 star cookie otherwise. Had to dip bottoms in white chocolate to make sweet enough. Fresh coconut is far from sweet and it doesn't cook as well.

I have always loved macaroons, and this recipe was pretty good, although not the same as the ones from the bakery. I had some trouble getting them off of the wax paper as other people have mentioned, so I was forced to dip them in chocolate. I also have to admit that I did not enjoy their taste the 1st couple of days...I found the sweetened condensed milk flavour too overpowering. But after taking them out of the freezer after a couple of weeks I found that the coconut flavour came through quite nicely. I'm not sure if I would make them again.

The best homemade macaroons I have ever tasted. Huge hit and so easy to make. Just be sure you don't over bake them. But, if you do..a day in a zip lock bag will soften them up.

The best macaroons I've had in a long time. We ran out of coconut so we added a little flour and they still came out great.  These are a new addition to our holiday cookie rotation.

Super easy and doesn't require much time or ingredients. I melted milk chocolate in a sandwich bag and cut out the corner to drizzle it on the macaroons. Next time I make these I will double the recipe.

This recipe absolutely is the best I've tried.  The cookies melt in your mouth!   I sprayed parchment paper with cooking spray and they lifted off perfectly.  I also used a melon ball scoop for smaller cookies and this recipe yields approx 50.  I also took advise of others and used almond extract.  Everyone loves them!

This recipe was a little disappointing. The flavor was good, but the macaroons came out very crispy and too dry. I will stick with my old recipe - thanks!

Not a big fan of these.  They seemed tough.  I was careful to watch them and cook at the right temp for the right amount of time but something just didn't turn out right.  I may try again.

This is a great recipe.  I made them a few weeks ago and left them in the oven for 15 minutes.  I found them a bit too dry.  I made them again today and decided to remove them from the oven after 10 minutes and they turned out moist and not so over cooked like the last time.

Excellent recipe! I've never made them before but it was a pretty easy recipe. Usually, I don't even like coconut but I LOVED these! It was hard to stop eating them. Just didn't have parchment paper to set them on. Oiling the cookie sheet worked just as well for me. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I made these for a bridal shower and they were a hit!  I didn't need to bake mine for as long as the recipe states.  That could just be my oven.  I suggest checking them after 8-10 minutes just to be sure.  Coconut burns fast!

I made a trial batch of these cookies I will be taking to a 50th birthday party, and shared them at work.
I got so many responses and ask many ask for the recipe!
Excellent and SO EASY to make!
This was a great find for me.

This recipe just did not work for me. Since it received so many rave reviews - and is a blue ribbon winner - it was probably my execution that was off.  Although I tried to follow the directions exactly, the macaroons came out rather brittle. I was also quite aware of a 'floury' taste. I will be trying this again, however, and I will take the suggestion of others to lower the oven temperature a bit.

I had to lower them to 300 degrees and cook for about 22 min to avoid having them burn.

The parchment paper worked great, and a touch of almond extract was a wonderful addition.

Thanks for the recipe!

Very good! I baked these for Easter so I added green food coloring to the mix and shaped cookies into nest.  Immediatly after baking I topped with 3 starburst jelly beans.  I also added 1/2 tsp of almond extract with the 2 teaspoons vanilla.

This was excellent.  My family moved from NY to NC, and we could not get good macaroons in NC, so I decided to try this recipe.  It was amazing!  I made a large batch following the directions.  Then, I took most of them and covered them in melted chocolate (with just a little bit of shortening in it), and then refrigerated them.  Then, I made another batch with chocolate chips in it.  The chocolate covered macaroons were the best, but they were all great.  My mother said that she will never buy macaroons again (even in NY)!

These were average macaroons.  next time I'll try to use egg whites instead of sweetened condensed milk, which can be a little too sweet.  Also, I substituted one third cup buttermilk and two thirds sweetened condensed milk instead of one whole cup sweetened condensed milk, to add tartness which turned out nicely.  I also added cinnamon.

I stopped making macaroons 20 years ago because home baked ones always turned out flat.  Bakery macaroons are puffy but are extremely sweet and artificial tasting.  I made these with 6 cups of coconut and used half vanilla extract and half almond.  Mine were done in 12 minutes although next time I will bake slightly longer.  I had no trouble getting them off the baking parchment paper after letting them cool slightly.
These are absolutely wonderful.  They stayed puffy and looked as good as they tasted.  I will be making these again and again.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I thought these were terrific - will be adding to my X-Mas cookie trays.  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding about a half a bag of semi-sweet chips at the end.  I then melted the rest of the chips and drizzled over the top.  Very decadent!  Tasted more like candy than anything else.  I think next time I might add some chopped almonds to the mix with the semi-sweet chips, then add a whole almond on top of the drizzled chocolate - sort of like an almond joy.  I think that would be nice for the holidays.  Oh - and I made mine slightly larger than walnut-sized and I got about 3-1/2 dozen.

First of all, no need to mix it with your hands, because then you lick your fingers and end up eating the whole first batch raw. Second batch, try baking on a Silpat, I didn't have any sticking problems!

These were very easy to make. The baking time was about 20 mins for a nice golden color. I used 1 1/2 tsp of the vanilla and 1/2 tsp of Almond extract. I was left with a strange after taste though, which I think had something to do with the Almond Extract. I used parchment paper and had not problems with sticking. Half the batch I added chocoloate chips and the other half I left plain. I wasn't too crazy about these, but I am giving them 4 stars because my husband would not stop commenting on how good they were.

These are soooo good. My husband loves them. They are rather rich though! Just one or two do it for me. Probably because I used sweetened coconut. Yum :)

Excellent. I made these for my Dad, the only thing I changed was doubling the baking time, as he wanted them with a more toasted flavor. They didn't last long.

This recipe is pretty good, but I prefer the almond paste version of coconut macaroons better. The condensed milk gives these macaroons a different texture and I don't care for it, but others may like it better!

My mother loves coconut!  So naturally I made thse for her originally and my boyfriend came over and said how amazing they were.  I took the advice of other's and mixed the sweetened cond. milk with the vanilla in a seprate bowl.  I also was sparing with it, using almost all of it but not quite because I noticed people complained about it tasting milky.  I also found out if you let the cookies sit out for a day or too they taste even better because everything seems to soak into the cookie.

Ths was pretty easy to make and tasted pretty good. I was looking for a softer outside, it came out a little to crunchy..also, try to use more recent bought coconut flakes, I had a bag of this stuff in the pantry for a while and used it but it had a little stalely taste to it. I would make this again.
