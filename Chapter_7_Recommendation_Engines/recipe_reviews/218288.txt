I just made this for dinner this evening.  I have been making it for years.  I find it easier to use the refrigerated minced garlic because I always keep a jar in the fridge.  I just toss some in the skillet and saulte it in the butter and some olive oil then add the spinach.  When the garlic gets a tad brown, it is crunchy and yummy.

This was very tasty. I added red pepper flakes and reduced fat feta after it was cooked. Thank you for sharing!

Very nice - simple, straight forward flavors. The only change I made was a personal preference, to mince the garlic.

I love this and have been making it for years.  It's a great way to add spinach to your diet.  The only thing I do that's different is add some onion to the butter since we really love the flavor it adds.

I've had this since I was a kid.  I use a splash of balsamic vinegar instead of the lemon juice.  I use this same method for beet greens too.

We get this dish at a very expensive place we go to on special occasions.  Thought I'd see if this was it.  Hubby took one bite and said "Wow, this is just like Eddie's!"  Love it, we'll be eating alot more of this! UPDATE:  I have used frozen spinach, you just have to drain it really well.  Fresh is better of course.

My family has cooked this for yrs.  Spinach cooked sepeate, crushed garlic, no salt.  Any leftovers go into a pasta & white clam sauce dinner.  For people who love their greens, sauce is good with chopped kale, beet tops & whatever.  Fast easy & yummy.

Excellent!! I followed this exactly! I then put the cooked, drained spinach in 4 tomato cups I had zig-zag cut around and hollowed out. I topped grated parm and warmed slightly in the oven. It was a nice presentation along side a filet. UPDATE: I have made this 5-6 times since and it is worth making instead of buying frozen! So easy and flavorful. Thank you!

Love Garlic Spinach. We follow my mothers recipe and use  about 3 cloves of garlic browned in olive oil, which are removed from the oil after browning. Then  just add a little salt to taste afterward. We also love to add boiled potatoes that have been quartered (small red ones) to the mixture. It is colorful and wonderful!

Used 2 T. Butter & 3 large cloves of garlic chopped. Followed the directions except I used the Salt Grinder and ground sea salt into the garlic butter cooking on low. Used a WHOLE HUGE Package of Costco Spinach and just added large handfuls and kept turning it. Forgot about the lemon because I was BBQ'ing the rest of dinner. Will definitely be making this again. Doesn't need the lemon. This was delish! DH really liked it too and he is a "Creamed Spinach or forget it" guy. Great find!

Always dependable, always delicious.  Use garlic to taste and don't let it brown!  I do not use the extra garlic salt.  I generally don't add lemon juice but found it a nice, refreshing finish.

I made this on a whim after stumbling across it in my recipe box (trying to plan NEXT week's menu) and remembering I had a bag of spinach on it's last legs in our frig and realizing it would go perfectly w/the beef and potatoes already in the dinner line up.  Boy, did it ever!  And so easy!  I followed the recipe using 1 bag of spinach, 3 garlic cloves, 1 T butter, a dash of (bottled) lemon juice, and a sprinkle of season salt (it was in front and I was too harried to find the garlic salt).  Mr. LTH RAVED about this and I, for some reason, often find myself w/extra spinach to use or toss, so this will def become a regular side at the LTH house.  THANKS, Danni!

Side dishes do not come fresher, faster or easier than this one! Delicious as is or with a few red pepper flakes tossed in with the garlic.  As others have stated jarred minced garlic is handy and works just as well.  All ingredient amounts are easily adjustable to suit your taste ... play around a bit.  I'm looking forward to replacing the butter with the oil oil or adding a bit of sesame oil next time.  Adding a sprinkle of parmesan or feta cheese before serving tastes great also! Thanks for the recipe and all the viewer tips!!

I too add a little red pepper flakes to butter & garlic before adding the spinach.  Right before serving I top it with chopped hard boiled eggs.  Just like grandma used to do.  This is a fast, healthy & delicious dish.

Well, I used this recipe as inspiration for a 9oz box of grn giant frozen plain ol chopped spinach. I let that thaw and squeezed some excess moisture out. Anyway...I warmed a swirl of olive oil and a tsp of reg butter in 8" saute pan. I added 1 large clove of garlic (crushed with side of knife) to oil/butter & sauteed til garlic softened. I use a fork to mash it up. Didn't use any garlic salt, just sea salt. I sauteed spinach in same pan with a small splash of fresh lemon juice (yes, b careful w/amount of lemon). At this point it was "pretty good". I went further & added some fresh grated nutmeg, coriander, white pepper, and 1 tblsp dry sherry. Then this rocked! I placed in oven (350) for 15 mins while rolls baked off. Something you can definately play around with and I will use fresh spinach next time since it turned out so tasty!

I love garlic spinach, this is a good recipe.  I've been making a version of this for years.  Instead of garlic salt I use garlic powder and a splash of soy sauce.

Delicious! Done in a flash! Healthy and Economical. This made a perfect side dish to Artichoke Chicken (another yummy AR recipe). There's just something about the wonderful aroma of butter garlic and lemon juice. Oh...the spinach turns a lovely bright and fresh green colour too - So Kudos all around.

What a great side dish! We loved this. Be sure you dont burn the garlic, keep tossing the spinach until its wilted. I took it off the burner and let the steam finish wilting it.

6-4-15 I found this a little too tart or I would have rated this 5 stars if the recipe called for less lemon juice. I sauteed purple onions and red pepper flakes with the garlic for added flavor. Once the spinach was wilted, I seasoned it with salt, pepper and garlic powder. 04-13-19 Update: I make this quite often, I absolutely love spinach and garlic. I used fresh squeezed lime juice because that's what I had. Always a favorite.

I added a couple tablespoons of dark Asian vinager when if was cooking. It adds a little steam that help cooking as well as a nice aroma to the finished dish.

Perfect blend of seasonings, the lemon gives it a fresh yummy flavor. I only had a 5oz. container of spinach so it only made 2 servings (I reduced the garlic to 2 cloves). Will definitely put this in my rotation and make more next time. Thank you for sharing!

Awesomeness! I used two bags of frozen spinach. I forgot the lemon juice and at the last minute I used lemon pepper Mrs. Dash. I also added seasoning salt and pepper. Even my teen loved it. This will be a staple.

This is fantastic.  I chopped fresh garlic in the food processor the second time and caramelized it in butter before adding the spinach.  It was delicious! I highly recommend.

This is my kind of recipe...quick and easy.  I followed recipe pretty much as written except using lime instead of lemon.  I tasted it and it was so good.  Then decided to add the red pepper flakes and feta cheese just to see if it would add anything and it did!  Really liked the combination of flavors.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe and for all the helpful reviews.

This recipe was just okay.  My Mom and I both agreed that it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  However, my husband hated it.  I'm glad to know there are others that enjoy it though.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I made this as a side dish for our evening meal. It was easy to make and had a lot of flavor. The next time I make this I plan on cutting back on the lemon juice a little.

I just made this today for my lunch using the recipe provided.  However, I used fresh picked rainbow chard from my garden.  I used the stems, cutting them small, as well as the leaves and cooked until the stems still had a little crunch.  It was delicious and is now part of my diabetic diet.  The flavor is easily changed by adding a little sesame oil or parmesan or feta cheese - options are many according to taste preference.

We used roasted garlic instead of fresh. Brings out so much more flavor. Also didn't use garlic salt. Just a little sea salt.

I had just prepared Salt Cod Stew and Joan asked, "What about a side dish?" So after a few minutes checking my All Recipes App, I found this to go along with what I had on hand and a delicious addition. Fast and easy to prepare, we sprinkled on a little Feta making it a little extra special.

This was very good, however I can get the same thing with a lot less work with a bag of frozen spinach and you do not need to add butter which just makes a very healthy vegetable not quite so healthy.  I used vinegar instead of lemon juice as that is how we like to eat cooked spinach.

Now add some plump fresh scallops and chopped Shitake mushrooms, and you have the dish I had last Sunday at a well respected Fish restaurant here in San Diego.  AHHHHH some.  So that inspired me to try the same sauce with Kale and Mustard Greens.

Made this for dinner tonight with a couple of changes. I omitted the garlic salt because I put a little extra fresh minced garlic. I also substituted some balsamic vinegar at the end as suggested by another reviewer. (I don't care for lemon juice in greens)All in all a very good recipe, which I will be saving to make again.

This was so good! I typically use balsamic vinegar with my spinach but the lemon juice was a nice, refreshing change. It paired perfectly with my seared ahi tuna :)

I made this for dinner as a side dish. I followed the recipe but also added shredded gouda cheese to the top and let it melt before serving. Nothing special, but it tastes good, it's quick and healthy! Even my 1 yr old daughter loves it!

Easy and delicious! I wouldn't add too much lemon or use a sprinkle of balsamic vinegar instead.  I have also added mushrooms into the mix.

Very good... my only change is that the 6 cloves of garlic are a little much... I just use two of the big cloves and that's usually enough.  Melt the butter and cook the garlic in first then put the spinach in.  Very nice side dish for quick week night meals.

Easy and fast. Used minced garlic to taste and even sprinkled a little extra garlic powder as well. Sadly, no fresh lemon on hand, so I used seasoned rice vinegar instead. Sprinkled a little feta at the end and tossed with some roasted red pepper strips. It made a beautiful side dish to the panko-crusted chicken I served tonight.

Meh, this just didn't come together very well.  I used lemon juice since I didn't have any fresh ones on hand, and that really overpowered everything.

This was a flavorful and healthy side dish.  I used extra virgin olive oil in place of the butter and paired it with some lightly breaded fish for supper.

I added a little bit of olive oil too. Alone it is great or can be used as a sauce base. I added some diced canned tomatoes and cooked pasta. I mixed it up and let it simmer.  Adding a dash of sweet basil was also yummy.

I liked this.  I love spinach and garlic so this was a dish that was perfect for me.  Its simple and delicious. I gave it 4 stars because it wasn't one of those things that I was WOW'd by, but it was definitely a tasty side dish.

yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum- I know how much a lot of you hate a review when the recipe has been altered- but I didn't have lemons so I used lime juice and I didn't have time to thinly slice the garlic so I used a garlic press and wound up peeling 7 instead of 6. OUTSTANDING, this is our new way to enjoy spinach, thank you~

The garlic was the perfect amount, but I would suggest using a little less lemon if you do not take to lemons well.  I used plain salt rather than garlic salt since garlic was already added and also added in about 1/8 tsp of black pepper.  A great accompaniment to just about any protein.

Pretty good and simple recipe for spinach. I minced garlic (personal preference) and just added a pinch of kosher salt as I don't use garlic salt and the recipe has plenty of garlic in it. I only had bottled lemon juice on hand and just added a little of that. Perfect and so easy to make for a quick side dish.  Thanks for the recipe!

I use the jarred chopped garlic and the lemon juice from the bottle, but I really enjoy this every time I make it. You should probably get a lot more spinach though, this doesn't make enough for 4, at least not for my family.

I make this every Sunday for our family meal. I've left off the lemon and use 4-6 bundles of fresh cut spinach instead of bagged but everything else remains the same. The family loves it and it is so easy to make. It's that last dish I prepare and the first on the table.

I didn't add enough garlic but that's because I made garlic chicken along with it. It's simple and really tasty!

I liked this dish way more than I thought I would. It was easy and delicious. We used fresh garlic but we might try minced garlic from a jar next time to see if it’s as good but a little easier.

I tried this recipe and made it my own. I added red, orange and yellow sweet peppers, roasted garlic, and white cooking wine! Delicious, this will be a permanent side dish from here on out. I also used 16oz bag of fresh spinach!

This is my second x making this recipe. It is superb and goes well with porterhouse steak that we ate this evening for dinner. The only changes I made was using garlic powder rather than salt, and like a reviewer did, I used refrigerated minced garlic. I didn't have any cloves or salt and the substitution made no difference. The is an easy recipe and sure does please everyone eating it. Thanks.

Turned out delicious! I recommend using more spinach though. Like 2-3 bunches if you want more. Especially since it wilts and shrinks when you cook it. Will definitely make this again! ??

Made exactly as directed, and the lemon juice ruined it for me.  I was a little hesitant to add it, but I didn't see it mentioned in any of the reviews I read (about 10), but hubby put a bite in his mouth and went "ugh, what's this acid thing going on?"  If I make this again (which I probably will, or something similar), I will omit the lemon juice.

I thought it was great. I’ve made it twice now. I use Baby Spinach. Tonite (the day after Thanksgiving), I added some turkey and some slivers of Asiago cheese. Love this...it’s now going to be regular dinner for me. Oh...by the way...it’s so easy to prepare.

My parents have been making a recipe loose identical to this since I was a kid. Add some chicken broth towards the end and let it simmer.

Amazing! Ingredients are sweet and Short to the point. Seasoning is the perfect blend not to bland and not salty at all. I used fresh garlic minced instead of powder. The entire family loves it including the kids and even my seven month old (I used the baby bullet to blend)...Will definitely be making again!

This was phenomenal!! Once you make this you won't go back to any other kind of spinach. I would suggest doubling the recipe so it can last longer because if you don't you'll wish you did.

This is great! I was debating whether to make salad or cook the spinach, and had leftover onion + garlic chopped up. So, I followed the directions with the addition of the onions. So good! Glad I looked this up

I love spinach and grow it in my garden.  This is by far the best recipe for spinach not as an ingredient that I have ever had. This is how I'm fixing it from now on. Thank you for sharing it!

The touch of lemon juice was just enough to add flavor to the spinach and garlic, so that the spinach is not too garlicky.

Instead of butter and garlic salt,  I used a quality virgin olive oil, crushed the garlic, and a tiny pinch of red pepper flakes then added spinach. Salt and cracked pepper to taste before serving.

Wonderfully simple to make and everyone ate it right up.  Followed some other reviews and lightly added some crushed red pepper.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly as written.

Very good, and easy! Instead of butter I used EVOO (extra virgin olive oil), and I used added fresh chopped garlic. Top it with pepper, and red pepper flakes, and you've got an amazing spinach dish! :)

This was so easy and delicious! Like other cooks suggested, I cooked minced garlic in the butter and then added a bit of parm at the end. Next time I will omit the lemon juice. It did brighten the dish, but I don't think it added any real flavor value.

Outstanding! I used one bag of Dole Baby Spinach, and followed the recipe except that I used minced garlic. It cooked down to about 2/3 Cup, which was perfect for one person (me!). I'll continue to use this again and again!

I only used one bag of spinach and cut the lemon in half -was still very strong.  My suggestion is to cut back more and add after if needed.

Loved this recipe, it is now what I do with all of my leftover spinach from when I make spinach salads, seems like I always have leftover spinach in my refrigerator! I use alot of garlic when I make this, and only from the bulb, crushed with my meat cleaver. Along with the lemon juice I use an adobo all seasoning salt with lemon and pepper. Definitely use a good olive oil in substitution for butter, way tastier, and healthier too, and you can eat all you want and not feel any guilt! As you can see in my photo, sometimes I will add leftover mushrooms that I use to make salads and pizza!

So easy to make. If you trying to  put together a healthy meal and don't have the time, this recipe is for you. I followed the recipe as close as I could, but I seldom measure anything. Yes I added an extra clove of garlic, and a little extra lemon.  The lemon really makes it pop. Best of all, there were no leftovers.

Prepared exactly the way the recipe stated and it turned out delicious. My 10-year-old and 12-year-old gobbled it up. Served it with panko-crusted sockeye salmon.

Great way to use spinach.  I used olive oil and skipped the lemon juice based on personal preferences.  Quick and easy.  But I would use spinach in other ways in the future.

I'd have added a picture, but I was keeping it warm a little too long and it wasn't quite as pretty. But it was really delicious and my new favorite way to prepare fresh spinach. Thanks for this great recipe!

This is a great way to dress up spinach!  I used minced garlic instead of sliced, and didn't measure the garlic salt.  Next time I will try topping it with some feta, as someone else suggested.

I love love love garlic, and this dish is such a perfect side dish (or main dish if you're vegetarian)!  I don't use the lemon or salt,  as I use salted butter, and it comes out just perfect. I will definitely be making this many many times.

Reminds me of something you would get at a fine Italian restaurant. I halved the recipe because I had one bag of baby spinach. I cooked the spinach for about 3 min, added minced garlic and continued to cook another 2 min (total of 5 min cooking time for spinach works best for me). I need to go a little lighter on the lemon juice (don't want such a prominent lemon taste....too tart). I topped with sea salt and cracked black pepper. UPDATE 10/3/19: Changed things to suit my taste. Skipped the lemon juice. Sauteed onion in EVOO and butter for 5 min, then added the garlic for a min. Added the baby spinach, sauteed 4-5 min. Salt, pepper and topped with feta cheese. (I know, different recipe now.) Nice one-bowl dinner. The modifications brought this to over-the-top deliciousness!

Loved it.  I used grape seed oil to roast the garlic and spinach instead of butter and it turned out great.  I also added sliced cherry tomatoes at the end along with some Parmesan cheese on top.  Very good flavor. Will definitely make again.

My mom has made a form of this for me ever since I was a child; its an old Italian way of making spinach that has been catching on nowadays!

However, its best to cook frozen or fresh (not canned) spinach (whole leaf, not chopped), and add a teaspoon or more to taste of the minced garlic that comes in a jar in olive oil,  in Italian grocery stores. The garlic gives the spinach a nice taste without overpowering it as fresh garlic tends to do. My mom would also sometimes serve it mixed with chunks of cooked potato. This is one of my go-to comfort foods!

This is so simple and delicious!  One of my friends makes this and calls it "spinach, Italian style."  My husband always complains that there's never enough because of how it cooks down.  A perfect, comforting accompaniment to a simple roast or grilled entree.

Enjoyed the spinach very much.  Very easy to make.  I was tempted to add more butter, but it didn't need it.  The original butter lasted, and the spinach sprang water that helped with the continuous cooking.  It came out nicely.

This is so simple but so good, used lemon pepper blend instead of salt and lemon, based on what I had on hand. Want to try with balsamic instead of lemon juice as mentioned.

Super easy and good. I added some grated parm cheese, which made it delish.

I really liked  this.  I was able to throw this together for lunch one busy afternoon working.  I did not add the lemon and roughly chopped the garlic.

My mother cooked this when I was a child ( I am now 69), but she used canned spinach and used vinegar instead if lemon juice.  I could smell the aroma of her kitchen when I read your recipe.  The fresh spinach makes it much better, but if in a jam canned could be used.

Phenomenal! I made a vegan version using earth balance butter and a bit of olive oil. I also added a splash of white wine with the lemon juice, along with some zest. Nutritional yeast was added at the end to tighten it up a bit and add some creaminess. Tossed it with some linguini and violá!

This is super easy, tasty and healthy. Only recommendation is buying extra spinach. It will wilt away quickly on you but this is a very good side with chicken, beef or fish.

Very easy and turned out great! Works well with minced garlic too. 
And yes - you need 2 bags of spinach. One bag barely serves 2 people once it's wilted. Goes well with spaghetti.

I am not a big cooked spinach fan, but wow this was great.  I minced the garlic instead of slicing it.  Otherwise followed the directions.  Left out the lemon.  I would make this again and again.

This was good especially if you like garlic.  Tried this a second time and used just two cloves of garlic a bit less than a teaspoon of garlic salt.  That seem to hit the spot with my family particularly the 3 year old.

With all the garlic and lemon juice, I expected a more flavorful dish than what I ended up with; it just tasted like wilted spinach. It was a little better the next day, but nothing to write home about. I will probably try it again, using either fresh or frozen spinach - it's quite possible the bagged spinach I used just wasn't a good foundation.

This was very good, but I sauteed some onions in wine and added it to the spinach, so I might be a bit biased in my opinion.

Very good!  My bad for not measuring out the lemon juice - came out a bit sour.  But that's my fault.  Otherwise, very good.

Im not a fan of cooked spinach, but my husband absolutely loved this!  I think the recipe should be doubled if you are cooking for a crowd or large family since 2 bags of spinach really wilts down to almost nothing!  Made the house smell yummy, and the spinach was very flavorful without having to add table salt.

Fantastic! So much flavour, especially when you fry some bison sausage in the pan with the garlic, before adding the spinach.

Such a simple, yet elegant side dish.  My 12 year old and I really enjoyed this recipe.  She doesn't love garlic, but it didn't seem to overwhelm in this recipe.  I think it was the lemon juice that gave it a perfect balance.  Tangy and delicious!  We used the baby spinach in a large plastic container (from a discount club).

Couldn't believe it.  Our family does love garlic so thought might get my picky veggie eater to try.  She reluctantly took the required one bite.  She asked for seconds!  A win.  

Easy - got the kids to help as it was easy for them to pull off the spinach stems and tear for preparation.

I love this recipe!  I've never tried it with the lemon juice because I never have it on hand but it still tastes great.  The amount of spinach needed at first may seem intimidating but they really shrink in size as you cook it.

Made this last night and it was delicious! I didn't have 2 bags of spinach and I was only cooking for myself so I had to alter the recipe a tad, but it worked out. I did about 3 handfuls of spinach (which really made one serving) and 3 1/2 cloves of garlic (using the minched garlic). It came out very delicious. I would make this again.

I thought this tasted alright. I cut the recipe in half and still got 4 good sized servings. I expected it to taste really garlicky, but it didn't at all. I make a stove top creamed spinach somewhat similar to this and am a little partial to it, but this worked well as a side with the rest of the meal which I thought was some what heavy. TY
