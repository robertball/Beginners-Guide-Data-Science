This is a great basic teriyaki salmon recipe.  I tweaked it and used what I had in the pantry - olive oil instead of sesame oil, minced garlic instead of garlic powder - I've made this probably 5 times and used different ingredients each time but it always turns out great - it's a great basic recipe!

So I was looking for a recipe that I have been using for a year or two and couldn't find it on here anymore. This one comes close and seems to incorporate the suggestions from reviewers from the other recipe. 
Long story short, I love this recipe and have been making this many times. It never fails. I do go a bit easy on the lemon juice.
Thank you!!

Love, love, love this recipe! I've made it twice now. First time I marinated as directed and it was decent. Second time I marinated it all afternoon and it was to DIE for!!! I didn't broil but just baked the salmon, basting it a few times with the reserved marinade. My son even asked for seconds, which he NEVER does with fish. His sister told him she wasn't giving up her salmon when he asked! I'm making this again very soon.

This was my first time cooking salmon and it turned out great! I used salmon filet's and broiled about 6 minutes and then finished in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes. Nice crispy exterior and moist and flaky interior. The only other thing I changed was more garlic and a bit of red pepper flakes. Wonderful recipe!

This was really good. I loved the sauce so much (also, I had had no idea what actually went into teriyaki, and was excited to make it from scratch) that I kept wanting more -- gonna double the portions for sauce next time!

I LOVED THIS! I didn't change the recipe at all and it came out great! This was the first time i have ever made teriyaki salmon before and it was super easy. It was better then any salmon I have ever had at a restaurant and my parents agreed.

This is a great marinade for salmon but I'm not giving 5 stars b/c my family & I thought it had too much lemon juice and it diluted the teriyaki flavor too much. I was able to salvage by using more soy, brown sugar, and spices.  I will make this again while implementing my own small changes and will also marinate longer than 2 hours.

Instead of soy sauce and brown sugar I just used teriyaki sauce to cut out a step.  I didn't have time to marinate it for 2 hours, but 20 minutes did the trick.  This is by far the best salmon recipe I have ever used.

Marinated mine overnight. Headed red pepper flakes to increase the spiciness. Came out perfectly.

Good, tasty, but could have used a little more flavor -- maybe I'll increase the marinading time.

I made this exactly as directed--and I even marinated it for 24 hours--, and while it was decent, I've had better store-bought sauces.  My husband and I both agreed that we didn't *dislike* it--it just didn't impress in any way.

Awesome! Made twice, the first time I marinated it for almost 24 hours, then I broiled it and although it briefly caught fire and was charred on the outside, it was still amazing. The second time I marinated it for 2.5 hours, and used the remaining marinade to cook them in a skillet and it was still good. i actually think I preferred the first one despite the burnt outside, probably due to the longer marinade and broiling method.

This is easy and great. I used a fillet. Just go easy on the sesame seeds because too many can make it bitter. I used the broiler. Next time I'll try it on the grill.

The marinade was very easy to make and tasty. I think my salmon would have benefited from marinading longer than I allowed, about an hour and a half. I would try several hours next time. Thanks for the recipe!

Super, super yummy. However, be careful not to overcook as it can become dry quite quickly. Overall, I definitely recommend.

Great tasting salmon!  I generally followed the recipe though used real garlic, ginger and mustard rather than dry spice versions.  I also used a 1.25 lb salmon slab with skin rather than cutlets.  I marinated about 4 hours.  It took a couple of extra minutes under the broiler.  The salmon was moist and tender. This was so easy and elegant that I’d serve it to company, but was happy to serve to family on a busy work night.  Thanks!

This recipe makes for a truly awesome base to work from, and the ONLY reason I didn't give it five stars is this:

I ended up adding TWO more tablespoons of Brown Sugar (it says to taste, but to get that teriyaki taste it really is a bit more sugary) - AND - I also reduced the sauce by lightly boiling it. 

Now what I didnt do was marinate it (never found that much a difference marinating fish) - BUT taking this thickened sauce and spreading it over the top with a spoon - it turned out WONDERFUL!

Like I said, it's a GREAT base to work from, but needed a little tweaking to make it truly GREAT!

THANK YOU!

This was fantastic to have. I make some minor adjustments--since I didn't have a salmon steak, I've used a fillet. Instead of sesame oil, I've used seasoned rice vinegar. I've broiled it than grilled it and paired it with Aldi's white rice. It cam e out pretty good. I would make it again.

Very tasty recipe! The only thing I changed was substituting soy sauce and sugar for bottled teriyaki sauce. I also broiled for 5 min each side and finished it off with 5 mins @ 350 degrees. Will make again.

Delicious!!  Very easy too!  I made few changes- only used 1/2 t ginger, used 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of powder, and didn’t add sesame seeds.  I also grilled it for 5 min per side and garnished with fresh lemon juice before serving.  Will definitely be my new go-to salmon recipe!

Delicious, quick and tasty.  Will make again! I substituted lime for the lemon and fresh garlic for the powdered variety.  For the final 15 minutes, I added shredded cabbage, carrots, onion to the pan, spooning the leftover marinade onto the salmon and the veggies. Served with rice and the veggies atop the salmon.  Simple.  (And my husband loved the change from the typical butter-capers-lemon that's my go to easy prep for any fish!) Thank you for sharing.

This one is on my family's favorite list now! I didn't bother actually cooking the marinade and just put all of it in a bag and squished it really well until the sugar dissolved. I do strongly suggest making sure all the salmon pieces are roughly the same thickness or you keep having to open and close the oven testing the different spots.

I made the recipe pretty much as is. I marinated the salmon for 4 hours and then grilled one side , flipped over, topped with the sauce and finished until just done. 
I served with a store bought Southwest salad.

I made this on a gas grill and it was quite tasty.  Next time, I'll use more of the marinade pre-grilling as I didn't need as much as was set aside for use during grilling.

I made the recipe with ingredients as written.  Yes, sesame oil is a potent item, as can be lemon juice, but just trust it.  I marinated for about 6 hours out of necessity when I had to leave the house.  I've had better salmon recipes, but the two others that ate it thought it was fine.  Broiling would have made a huge mess in my oven, so I baked at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes and a couple minutes under the broiler.  I think that was a little long to bake, so would have done 15 minutes instead.  I'm sure broiling would have helped the taste to get a little carmelization going, but it WILL make a mess.  Recipe is fine, but I probably won't make again.

Don't  discard  the marinade. I did not reserve any for basting. I poured it all on a 2lb fillet and left to soak overnight. While fish was broiling skin side up, I poured the marinade in a shallow pan to simmer and reduce. I took out the the fish after 5 minutes and transfered it to the pan flesh side down to finish cooking. I am Asian and do stock  sesame oil in my pantry but it's very strong in large quantities not to mention expensive. Use your preferred cooking oil to substitute.

This was easy to get together and the flavors worked well with the salmon.  I did use fresh ginger which I think gave the salmon a fresh taste.

I made this recipe a number of years ago, and decided to do it again. It's simple enough, healthy enough, and delicious enough to want to do it again and again. Even my daughter loved it, and she's not  a fish eater.

This recipe was really good and had nice flavor to it. The only thing is I wanted the salmon more firm or crispy. I'm not sure if me marinating it overnight, instead of a few hours, made the salmon super soft in the middle or if it was cause by something else. I may grill the salmon next time or broil it longer.

I agree with many of the other reviewers, tasty, easy and a "go to" recipe for salmon.  There is a lot of heat in the marinade so taste test as you go to get the right heat for your tastes.  Delicious!

This was EXCELLENT despite what others said about it lacking flavor. HUGE HIT! It's also super EASY! My 11yr old cooked this entirely by herself. She did add a little extra Brown Sugar as suggested, along with a squeeze of Honey. In first 5min broil, it burnt a bit like others said, so she lowered the shelf and baked it for 10 minutes. BEST SALMON EVER!!

Made recipe as is, except for adding a little more brown sugar than called for (knowing that most of the marinade wouldn't be consumed).  Broiled it in the oven, because right now it is December in Canada.
This made for a good (sweet/salty balance) and also resulted in my selective teen finishing her entire piece of salmon (I used wild-caught).  Perhaps cut down on the lemon a tad next time.
Will definitely make again!

This was amazing!! I was concerned there wasn't going to be enough flavor so I reserved the sauce for basting for pouring over the salmon and a bed of rice. Will be making this again!

I followed the recipe just as written, however I seasoned the salmon first with lemon pepper and ol bay seasoning. Didn't have sesame oil, used olive oil instead during cooking I used a little liquid butter. Turned out awesome.

This recipe is a keeper. I'm not big on salmon but my husband is and with this recipe it was delicious. We grilled the marinated salmon on a gas grill along with some bok choy and then paired it with some steamed rice. Yum.

I made the mix but instead of binging it to a simmer and then pouring the marinade into a bag with the salmon. I used white pepper and salt and browned the salmon on both sides then I put the marinade into the same pan and simmered for about 4 mins. That gives you all the flavor and its fresh. As well as once it caramelized you can use it as a topping for the salmon and rice (if you made rice)

I liked this.  We added a little more sugar per other reviews.  I agree that a longer marinade time would benefit it..  I will use this as a base (will likely next time use fresh garlic and ginger).

It's very delicious, and I would actually make it again. Though, it's not one of those foods that you would eat daily. Once you finish one meal of teriyaki salmon, you're really stuffed and it just feels like you don't want anymore. It looked delicious, smelled delicious, and tasted very delicious -- I would recommend this to my friend.

Love it! I never like salmon because somehow all the ones I've made seem dry but this one is great. It was my first time using the broiler so the fish came out a bit burnt. Will probably marinate it a little longer than an hour though.

Tasty recipe - husband loved it.  Perfect for cooking on the grill pan.  I sub'd tamari for soy sauce, and honey for the brown sugar.  I also used minced garlic instead of powdered.   I made extra sauce to drizzle over the jasmine rice and the side of broccoli I steamed.  Delicious!

This salmon was so tasty!  I used olive oil and did not add the ginger because I forgot to buy it.  Only marinated for 40 minutes due to timing but was still delicious!  This is a quick and easy recipe for a healthy dish if you are pressed for time or ingredients.  Will definitely make this again!

This was delicious. At first I thought I had done something wrong because the amount of marinade seems smaller than the other recipes I follow but it was surprisingly flavorful.

My only criticism is that there is no Teriyaki in this Teriyaki salmon...I'd call it Sesame Salmon

This was really simple and tasted much better than store-bought teriyaki sauces. I used fresh squeezed lemon juice from a tree in my neighborhood, and I think my lemons were just too sour as they overpowered the flavor a bit. I also accidentally charred it a bit like another reviewer and the bit of black made it even better! One thing - use HONEY instead of brown sugar. It makes a huge difference and cuts the acid nicely.

This was very yummy. I added a lot more brown sugar and rice vinegar than the recipe called for, though, to taste more like the restaurants' teriyaki sauce.

I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. The salmon came out absolutely perfect. I was able to broil a pan-full of lightly oiled and salted asparagus at the same temperature, same amount of time, flipped at the same time as the salmon. A nice, easy, delicious side dish.

Really good, goes perfect with the salmon.  Easy to make.  If you broil, you may have 2-3 opportunities to baste before done.  I served this with stuffing instead of rice.  I can't wait to make more of this marinade and use it for chicken or burgers.

This is amazing, my teen daughter made this, it's easy and has a wonderful fresh taste, she made it under the broiler in the oven but would be awsome on the grill. 
Better than a jar of teriaki marinade, more of a fresh lemon flavor, we used fresh lemon juice i would not use the bottle.
