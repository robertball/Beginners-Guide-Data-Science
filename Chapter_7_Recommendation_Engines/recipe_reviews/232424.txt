Not very good at all. Very little pop (even after adding jalape√±o pepper. Little flavor.

I LOVE this! I added shrimp and made it better! And didn't measure the Cajun seasoning, I just sprinkled until it looked good. I'm also new at cooking so this was an easy start. I used a indoor grill and the chicken cooked perfectly. I definitely recommend this recipe.

I added mushrooms and served with zucchini noodles and regular noodles for my husband.  We loved it!  I also was out of Cajun seasoning and made my own.  Yum!
