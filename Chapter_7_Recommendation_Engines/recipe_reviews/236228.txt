We liked this soup.  Made as written except used four chipotles to increase the heat.  Next time we'll sub one cup of red wine for one cup of the broth and will add either lime juice or red wine vinegar to brighten it just a tad.

My husband and I love this soup. Instead of bacon, I used ham which I added after I had used the imulsion blender on the rest of the soup mixture. The flavor was excellent - upon serving we added shredded cheese and fresh jalapenos which topped it off perfectly. A definite keeper recipe!

Awesome recipe!  We used leftover country ham in place of turkey bacon.  Also did not mash any beans. Add a dollop of sour cream and jalapeño cornbread—yummy!

Made as called for. It was just ok to me. Not bad, but nothing special. Probably won't make again.

This was delicious! The recipe could be changed to include meat, or just as is. I whipped mine up in the crock pot. Fired the turkey bacon to a little more crisp than usual and gave that a coarse dice. The veggies went into the pan I friend the bacon in, and all of that and the chicken stock went into the crock pot for about four hours. I served it with shredded cheese and a dollip of sour cream alongside a grilled cheese, tomato, and turkey sandwiches. Excellent recipe!

Turned out pretty good. I used two chipotle peppers instead of one and used my hand held immersion blender to blend out some of the beans. I ended up needing to add more chicken stock to thin it out some after that. Wish I made a double recipe so I'd have some left over.

This recipe I first had on Galiano Island over the Holidays about 15 years ago.  My Mum who deserves a few Michelin Stars herself for consistent fabulous meals !  With never an over cooked, undercooked, or otherwise butcheries that to many make when attempting recipes that are as unfamiliar as foreign languages are.

I love this soup!  I made it exactly like the recipe, and the flavor was great, but I needed a little more heat, so added the whole can (7.5 oz) of  chopped up chipotle peppers WITH the adobe sauce.  You could adjust the amount to your desired heat level.

Great recipe!  I already bought the ingredients to make it again!!!

Wow,  this is delicious.  I used regular bacon and cooked it in the pot, then poured out some of the grease and used the rest to saute the onion. I also used two chipotle in adobo sauce. I might try it with beef stock next time, but it works very well with chicken stock.

Made as written and it was very good. The chipotle adds a nice touch of heat with a slight smoke flavor. I think this could be better by frying the bacon first to get it crispy and remove bacon from the pan. Add some of the bacon back to the pot towards end of cooking. Then, mash/blend to desired consistency. Use remaining bacon bits as a topping. My husband topped his bowl of soup with some shredded cheddar and sour cream.  Overall, good soup and easy to make!

Super tasty! The flavor is amazing, considering there's only cumin used as a seasoning. No need to add anything else! I used low-sodium chicken broth and it was salty enough. The only change I made was to use 2 chipotle peppers instead of 1 because I like the added heat. The only criticism I have is that makes very small portions. Unless you are serving a tiny appetizer portion, you will not get 10 servings out of this. For me, I got 6 small bowls, so plan accordingly. When the soup was done simmering, I used my immersion blender and blended most of the soup, leaving a few chunks here and there.  Thanks for the great recipe Bacon Butterfly!
