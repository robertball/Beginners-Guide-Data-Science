Outstanding! After reading all 259 reviews this is what I did: (note, I doubled the recipe) I lightly sprayed a 13x9 pyrex with cooking spray, I measured out 4 cups of dry elbow macaroni, cooked this is boiling salty water for approximately 15 minutes. Drained in colander. Meanwhile, in same pot as the macaroni was boiled, I melted the butter (1 stick minus 2 Tbs), added the flour gradually (1/2 cup) and whisked constantly. I then added the milk slowly (4 cups), whisking constantly. I then added 1 lb of Velveeta that I had cubed, 2 tsp of garlic salt, 3/4 tsp of pepper, a dash of dry mustard and a shake of cayenne pepper. After the velveeta had melted I then added 3 cups of shredded cheddar cheese. Once all was melted together and stirred thoroughly I added the cooked macaroni. Placed in the dish, topped with reserved 2 Tbs of melted butter tossed with crushed buttery round crackers. Baked at 350 for 35 minutes. This was perfection! Great comfort food!

It was an average homemade macaroni & cheese.  My only suggestion is to only cook your noodles for half the time - so they are not already "done" when you put them in the oven.  If you only "half cook" them before baking when they come out of the oven they are not mushy but al dente.  I always do this when a recipe calls for a cooked noodle to go in the oven, it turns out much better.

I've been using this as my primary mac and cheese recipe for years and everyone raves on how good it is.  I just HAVE to make it for all family functions.  I'm from the south and we take mac and cheese seriously down here.  This recipe is a heck of alot easier than some and not near as dry.  Sometimes i use the velveeta, sometimes i don't(when i don't have it on hand) and it doesn't make too much of a difference.  THe velveeta is what makes it so creamy i think.  I also add more cheese, maybe half acup.  I usually forgo the cracker crumbs but a shortcut around baking it for so long is just putting in uder the broiler.  Also let it set for a few minutes after browning so it can set up a little.  THe cheese will run everywhere it you cut into it immediately.
My husband has banned all boxed varieties from thehouse and has because quite the mac and cheese snob thanks to this yummy and easy recipe.

I didn't have any of this but Hubs did and the man of few words said it was "very, very good - crunchy and creamy." And when asked how many stars he assigned it five without hesitation. Since he's pretty stingy with stars that must have been some darned good macaroni and cheese.  Too bad it's no longer in the AR line-up.

YUM YUM YUM!  This is very good.  I have made this several times already.  My son aks me to make this, no more boxed stuff.  I cut down on the prp time by making the white sauce in the micowave oven, it wont scorch in there, and dosent have to be stirred all the time, 6 minutes tops and its down.  Very good! Thanks for the great receipe!

We liked this pretty well.  For the reviewer that commented about the floury taste, be sure to let milk and flour mixture lightly boil, stirring constantly, for at least 3 - 5 minutes before adding the cheese, this procedure cooks the flour taste out.  I used Panko breadcrumbs for crispiness.

This IS comfort food! I like to preprep this the night or morning before dinner, cover and put it in the fridge, and pop it in the oven while I prepare the dinner's meat course. I cook my elbow macaroni till just slightly aldente, and add and extra cup of milk to the cheese sauce, because we like our mac and cheese creamy, and if I prep it ahead of time, the macaroni 'drinks up' the additional milk... end result no dry mac and cheese. I omit the bread crumbs because we like ours with a baked browned top. I also add my seasonings of a LITTLE salt, alot of black pepper, dash of onion powder,and pinch of dry mustard and paprika. Reheats nicely too.

This may be the best recipe I have gotten off this site!  I have never had such amazing mac and cheese.  This will be my recipe forever and may start going to pot lucks.  I really can't say enough about how cheesy it is!  I used Velveeta Light too and it worked fine.  I wanted to get in the casserole dish and eat my way out.  This is THE macaroni and cheese!

I have been making this for a while now and it is one of my favorite dishes. I double the recipe and use 3 bricks of my favorite cheese (usally sharp cheddar) instead of velvetta. You can also just boil the noodles first and then do everything right in the pot with them( the butter, flour and so on) With a double recipe just pur into a 9 by 13 inch pan and cook for 35 minutes or till cheese is getting brown and bubbly at the edges.

With the few changes I made, I definitely rate this a 5+. I modified/doubled the recipe and used 1 lb of elbows, about 10 oz of Velveeta cubed, 8oz package of casserole cheese, 1 pint of 1/2 and 1/2 with about 1 cup of skim milk, 1 stick of butter with 1/2c of flour. It was very creamy and not overly cheesy! Wonderful comfort food!

This was so wonderful and creamy!  I've never cooked with Velveeta before because it seems pretty gross, but decided to try this macaroni and cheese recipe because I wanted a creamy mac and cheese and this had good reviews.  The only things I did to change the recipe are I used reduced fat Velveeta, used sharp cheddar and I didn't do the bread crumb topping or bake it.  I was going to cook more macaroni for it when I saw that the noodles were practically swimming in the sauce, but decided not to and I'm glad I didn't!  As it was, the sauce was perfect and smooth and creamy.  It was also very filling.  Instead of using this as a side dish, I recommend having a bowl of it with a salad of thinly sliced cucumbers, diced tomatoes, olive oil, and balsamic vinegar (1 part vinegar to 3 parts oil, plus a pinch of salt and sugar).  This is comfort food at it's best!  It also tastes great if you leave out the Velveeta and add a bit more cheddar in it's place...

I have never had much luck making make and cheese but this recipe is so easy it came out AWESOME! The one and only thing I did different was I omitted the breadcrumbs because my kids don't like them. Other than that I made it as written. It was creamy and gooey. My 4 yr old niece said it made her tummy all warm. I will be making this often! thanks!

Really creamy, very tasty.  The only thing I didn't like with this recipe is I didn't think the topping was enough.  I will double the topping next time, and then it would be 5 stars!

This is the first time I've bothered to post - this is soooo good! It definitely needs more noodles (at least double the amount). I put crushed Garlic and Butter Flavored Ritz crackers on the top along with the cheddar cheese - delicious!

Awesome! This is the best Mac n' cheese I've had. I served it to my mom one day when she was staying with us; she said it is good enough to be served when we have company over for dinner. NOTE TO THOSE WHO RATE RECIPES WITH LOWER RATINGS WHILE ADMITTING THEY DID NOT FOLLOW THE RECIPE: Either don't rate the recipe until you try it again, or add your review without giving it a rating.

This is excellent macaroni and cheese!  I've made it twice and both times I used 1/2 cup half and half and 1-1/2 cups skim milk.  I added 1 tsp mustard powder and 1/2 tsp onion powder to the white sauce.  I used Mexican four cheese instead of cheddar and crushed 1/2 sleeve Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs.  Perfect!

I have been searching for a creamy, flavorful mac-n-cheese and this is it!  I add garlic salt and pepper to the cheese sauce and my family gobbles it up every time!  No lumps, curdles or greasy mess at all!  This is one I will take to pot lucks or serve to guests with a bone-in ham!  YUM!

This is a great mac and cheese recipe.  I usually use the Betty Crocker cookbook recipe.  But I was tired of pulling out the book everytime I wanted to make it, and I am addicted to AllRecipes.com so I wanted a recipe printed on an index card like all my other recipes.  I added finely chopped onion to the melting butter, and omitted the schredded cheese and bread crumbs.  Of course, nothing but Velveeta will do.  I even used the light Velveeta and it was still great!

I love this recipe! It tastes just like the kind my mom made when I was a kid. I love comfort food!! I add diced green peppers to the cheese sauce and jerk or cajun seasoning to the bread crumbs to give it a little more kick. I've also started using whole wheat pasta and you can't tell the difference. Use large pasta like rigatoni or ziti. The recipe makes a lot but I usually double it anyway so we have plenty of leftovers for lunches. It's one of those dishes where you sneak downstairs in the middle of the night and eat it cold out of the tupperware.

This is a great macaroni and cheese recipe.  I've done this w/ the Velveeta, but as an alternative I've substituted mozzarella, plus added in some parmesan and romano.  I also added some spices (garlic, oregano, black pepper, and red pepper flakes) in the sauce and used Italian bread crumbs.  I just sprinkle the bread crumbs on before baking -- I don't mix them with melted butter.  I agree with the other reviewers that you want to not cook the macaroni all the way -- drain it when it's 1-2 min from being al dente.

My husband, who does not like mac n cheese, hotdogs, baked beans or anything of the sort, said this is the best mac n cheese he's ever had.  This may not be saying much, but it makes it a keeper in my book for my 2 and 4 year old.  I also did not use any velveeta.  I mixed in 2 cups of shredded cheddar and topped with 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar.  I also mixed in diced ham to make it a complete meal.

Amazingly awful!  A spectacular culinary disaster!  This recipe was so bad it doesn't even warrant one star, but they don't allow negative stars in this rating system.  I would warn anyone considering making this to reconsider carefully.  There are a lot of great macaroni and cheese recipes on allrecipes, this just isn't one of them.

I screwed this recipe up every possible way and it was still great. My flour/butter/milk mixture never thickened, so I added more Velveeta. I also forgot to get shredded cheddar so used mozzarella instead. It was still tasty! I served with the Barbecue Ribs on this site and steamed artichokes - excellent! Will definitely make again.

Oh woooow! This was so creamy and cheesilicious! I tell you this was a winner and 5 stars plus +++. I scaled this recipe down to two servings since there are only two of us. Th flour mixture was cooked down before stirring in (skim) milk slowly and stirring until a boil formed. I mixed in the cheeses and then macaroni and put everything together with ease, nice and well blended with the bread crumbs on top. YUM! This velveeta cheese made this dish along with the breadcrumbs, nice crumbly topping. Definitely will be a repeat in my home and will end up in my recipe box for good.

Definitely stir and cook the flour/milk mixture!  I kept testing with a few bites until the "grainy" thing went away.  Also try a Bay Leaf or two after adding the milk.  YUM!  I also used 3 c. of noodles because we like extra sauce.  Wonderful recipe!  Thanks!  (Actually, Lane Bryant probably loves you more for this recipe!  LOL)

My family is in love with this mac and cheese! Its so gooey and cheesy, and the leftovers are GREAT! Whenever there is a covered dish I am asked to bring this dish and am always asked for the recipe! I omit the bread crumbs, and just sprinkle lots of shredded cheese on top. Also, I add 1-2 tsp dry mustard and use an 8oz package of macaroni noodles.

I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!  I followed most of the suggestions made by the reviewer Breeze.  Sort reviews by most helpful to find it at the top.  I did not add any cayenne and instead of topping with bread crumbs or crackers (my kids don't like it that way) I sprinkled on about 1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese at the end of the baking time and baked an additional 5 minutes.  Update: I've made this more times than I can count and have decided I like the texture better if I use 2-1/2 cups macaroni.  It's also really good with leftover croutons crushed up as a topping. No need to add any butter to them.

Excellent recipe!  My family loves it.  I too doubled the recipe except used the whole 1 lb. of velveeta, added 3 c. shredded cheddar and instead of bread crumbs added another 1 c. of jack/ colby cheese mix as the topping... We like our mac n cheese to be cheesy.  Instead of salt used garlic and onion salt.  Also added paprika.

This was my first time making mac n' cheese so I was very happy when I heard my name buzzing around the cookout in response to, "This is sooo good....who made this?"

Having read the other reviews I used a sharp cheddar cheese along with the Velvetta. And I substituted salt with Goya Adobe. It's important to season the milk, butter and cheese mixture to taste before adding it to the noodles. I try to "over-season" a little as the noodles take away some of the edge.

I'll make this again as people who said they normally don't like mac n' cheese started to incorporate large portions of it into their take home plates.

Hubby is a huge cheese fan....and this is amazing.  Many mac and cheese recipes that I have found have very little flavor, but not this recipe.  This is great.  I am glad that I have finally found the recipe that weill be used in our house as a staple.  Thank you for the post.

This recipe is terrific.  I added a little more milk after making it originally so that it would be more creamy.  I also added about 1/2 onion diced really fine to the butter while it was melting. Added alot of flavor and you couldn't even see the onion.  Simple & cheesey and so delicious!

This is very good macaroni and cheese.  I followed the recipe exactly.  My only complaint is that it is a little bland.  If I make again, I'll use a little more salt and medium or sharp cheese.

Awesome! I've been trying to find a good baked mac recipe for almost a year. My husband is from the south & INCREDIBLY picky about his food & he LOVED it! I'll definitely make this again. Next time though, I think i'll double the ingredients for the crumb topping... didn't seem to be enough for the whole dish.

Excellent recipe.  I've made it numerous times already and it always turns out creamy and cheesy.  The last time I tried it  I added 3/4 cup of shredded mozza cheese to the cheese mixture and 1/4 cup as topping with the breadcrumb and cheddar topping.  It was sooo good.
My husband LOVED it.

I made this recipe for the first time and it came out perfect! I took this recipe to a family get together, and it was a BIG hit. I used mild cheddar instead of velveeta as others recommended, and found it deliciously cheesy. Everyone loved it, from the adults to the children! I also doubled the recipe, and baked at 365 deg. for 30 mins. The bread crumbs seemed an unnecessary step to me, so I think I will omit them next time. I'm planning to make this again soon for the 4th!

This tasted amazing. The only thing was it seemed like it took FOREVER for the sauce to thicken. I think the prep time was a little wrong.Unless I did something wrong?

I will never eat boxed macaroni and cheese again.  This is the recipe I have been searching for.  Leftovers reheat well.  I prefer the crackers crushed finely. I think the cheese taste is perfect!

I've always made mac and cheese like this but with a few changes. No breadcrumbs. Use all the butter in the sauce and add extra cheese but I don't put any cheese on top. To the cheese sauce I add black pepper, dry mustard, a few drops of Louisianna hot sauce, and about 1/2 cup of sour cream.

My southern born and bred hubby begs for this dish all of the time!  I have made it for almost every holiday meal for the past three years because my family all demand I make it. lol  It is super easy and delicious.  I have made it in a lower fat method before by using reduced fat and/or fat free ingredients and whole wheat pasts noodles and it is still tasty, but not quite as soul satisfying!!

This is the BEST mac and cheese recipe out there.  So simple to make - I just love it.  I add a little bit more cheese and actually mix in some low fat sour cream with the noodles before adding the cheese sauce and baking.  This adds a nice tang as well as some great creaminess.  Perfect, thank you!

Mmmmmm good.  I followed the recipe exactly, except used extra-sharp cheddar and added a little more salt and some black pepper and it was perfect.  After baking it does get a little gritty, but still tastes amazing.  I don't think the baking is necessary, so next time I'm not going to bake it at all.

This is a great recipe.  I usually prefer the good 'ole Mac and Cheese (even with the dry powder cheese) so this was a stretch.  I read the reviews that described this as bland and grainy.  I believe the key is to use a whisk when adding the flour.  It took me a good 10 to 15 minutes to get mixture to thicken.  I used skim milk and did not have a problem at all.  I added a bit of red chili pepper when mixed with the macaroni.  This was great and I really impressed the family.  Thanks

There might be mac and cheese recipes out there that call for higher quality cheese, that are more sophisticated but they do NOT taste as good as this one.  I have tried so many recipes and none are as delicious as this one!

Wow!  This was great!  The perfect macaroni and cheese.  I didn't do the topping; it didn't need it.  I just sprinkled a little of the grated cheese on top.  I doubled the recipe and ended up adding the whole box of macaroni--which amounted to about 3-4 extra cups of macaroni.   There was still plenty of cheese sauce.  Everyone raved.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was very, very good!  I like that it's a fairly fast and easy recipe.  I did use 1lb. of macaroni, which is way more than called for.  You could probably also get away with 4 cups instead of 2 cups.  With 2 cups the noodles are just swimming in the sauce!

I made this recently, and substituted the Velveeta for mild cheddar.  I also cubed some ham (just like mom used to make!) and loved the results!  My husband said it was the best mac and cheese he's ever had.  Definitely a keeper!

Comfort food at its finest!  The recipe was very easy and much appreciated by the folks at work and my family.  May need a little more spice, but other than that it was great.  I made it ahead by covering it and putting it in the fridge overnight and then baking it the next morning, so it can definately be a make ahead meal.

This macaroni and cheese is very rich and creamy. My husband loved it and said so several times during dinner! I used crushed Ritz crackers instead of the bread crumbs. Definite repeater!

Out of all the recipes that I have tried on my family from allrecipes this is the first one where I didn't have to ask if they liked it. Right after their first bite my husband said wow this is good and the kids chimed in. Thanks for a great easy mac n cheese recipe I will use this often ! Thanks Sonya

This macaroni and cheese is so creamy and good.  It is the best basic macaroni and cheese I have made.  The cheese/bread crumb topping didn't go very far.  I would probably double it next time.

Nice Mac and Cheese recipe.  Easy to make, reheats well, and tasty.  The velveta gives a little extra creamyness.  I will make again since we love homemade mac and cheese at out house.

I decided to make this as a treat for my two boys.  It's very simple and the results were very good.  It was extremely cheesy and creamy, and we all enjoyed it.  It's not something I would make every week, as it's very rich, but it is true comfort food. I used a Tex-Mex cheese blend (with the jalepenos), and it gives it a great kick without turning the kids off. I did leave off the breadcrumbs, since I knew my kids wouldn't like it.

This recipe was a hit while it was still on the stove cooking!  It's nice and thick while still creamy, if that makes any sense!  I didn't have Velveeta on hand so I used around 4 oz. of brick Sharp Cheddar and shredded it myself.  I am sure it will all be gone in 5 minutes!

This was creamy, comforting and just what I think of when wanting homemade mac and cheese. I didn't put on any topping. I must admit, I stay away from Velveeta as it's processed cheese food, but I think it makes the difference for truly good mac and cheese in this case.

I made this for Christmas dinner this year and everyone loved it.  I was nervous because my husband asked if I would make "homemade macaroni and cheese."  Although I've never made homemade before this turned out great and got rave reviews.

I can't believe how cheesy this turned out!  I used light Velveeta (to reduce the amount of fat) & only about 1/2 the amount of shredded cheese & it was STILL cheesy!  Needed a little something though....maybe chopped onions?  Green chiles?  Diced tomatoes?  Will experiment a little in the future & give it another go.  Tasty, quick, & easy!

I did use 2 cups of cooked shells, not elbow but it seemed to need more noodles or less sauce.  Good flavor.

very good! it is VERY cheesey, almost too much, which, for a cheese person like me is saying a lot. so rich! my husband said this is what you would eat if you had been out chopping wood or shoveling snow for a few hours... I added a bit more cooked noodles as it seemed runny. I also added a little dry mustard and worchestershitre, because I always do but it is not necessary. To make it less runny or rich add noodles. thanks for the recipe it was gone in a flash (even though no one was chopping wood or shoveling snow :)

Excellent recipe! We all loved it - I think we like this one better from the one I used to make because it uses cheddar in addition to velveeta so the texture was nicer.  The only change I made was to use whole wheat flour and whole wheat macaroni. This is my mac & cheese recipe now - yum!

This wasn't near enough cheese sauce. When I made this, the sauce was a little too thick so I ended up adding another cup of fat free evaporated milk (I used that instead of regular milk to make it creamier because all I keep on hand now is fat free milk) milk and another cup of shredded cheese and 1/4 pound of Velveeta. I did add what I usually add to my macaroni and cheese; one tablespoon of dijon, a teaspoon each of garlic/onion powders and a couple shakes of Frank's hot sauce. My family thought the end result was very tasty, I had one bite and thought it was pretty close to the macaroni and cheese that Mom made with government cheese. I highly recommend that you add more milk and cheese.

This is a great basic macaroni recipe and very easy to spice up or alter when you are wanting a change.  I'm not a big fan of bread crumbs on my mac and cheese, so I substitute the bread crumbs for extra cheese.  I bake it long enough for the cheese to get melted, bubbly and crispy.

This is the classic Mac and Cheese I was looking for. I don't like to cook with processed foods but I'm willing to make an exception so I can have this a couple times a year. My husband likes his with sliced tomatoes on top.

This was just okay.  I agree that this is pretty dry and I think I prefer mine without processed cheese.  It also needs some pepper and maybe another spice.  Also more breadcrumbs on top!!  Definitely needs some tweaking but I think I prefer my standby.  Thanks anyway!

I have been looking for "the" macaroni and cheese and this is it. I hate the egg/custardy kind. I always double this and it fits into a 9 x 13 pan perfectly. I do not change any ingredients I just leave off the bread crumb topping. I don't feel it needs it and I just sprinkle the remaining cheese on the top. Even my husband who is not a big mac and cheese fan loves this.

I've made this before and am rating it Four Stars based on the recipe as is.  However, today I made it and didn't realize until I'd started cooking that I only had a little over 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar left.  I reserved that for the topping and substituted Colby Jack for the cheddar in the sauce.  I also added about 1/2 tsp fresh cracked black pepper to the cheese sauce.  OMG!  It is fantastic.  With these modifications, I would rate this FIVE STARS!  Try it!

Best mac & cheese we've had. I used cubed Velveeta, shredded colby & mild cheddar, and Kraft parmesan chesse as my cheese choices; I mixed 1/4 cup Panko bread crumbs with 1 T butter and sprinkled over the top before I baked--they browned nicely and added a delicate crunch. For those that have trouble with the white sauce, take your time to get the flour taste out, use a whisk to get the lumps out, and cook it slowly to make it creamy and ready to melt the cheese. Great recipe!

Perfect mac & cheese!! I added a dash of dry mustard and a tiny bit of onion & garlic powder to the flour/butter for a little extra flavor. My family thought it was the best home made macaroni and cheese they'd ever had.

I doubled this recipe for a 9 by 13 pan, and added garlic salt, pepper, and some dry mustard to it. I pretty much stood at the stove, and just whisked the mixture until the cheeses were melted. OMG it was so creamy, and delicious! This will be the macncheese of choice for us from now on! Instead of bread crumbs, I put crushed cornflakes on top because of our personal preference.

Since my original review I have made this MANY times.  I use the Velveeta, as this allows a more creamy texture.  I also add a smidgeon of dry mustard powder.  It is this change that makes me rate this a 4 star because, as the recipe is written, I believe it would be too bland.  However, with that small addition it is definitely a 5 star Mac and Cheese.  My husband has informed me I have ruined him forever for Macaroni and Cheese.  I love this stuff!!  Great recipe!

This is the first homemade macaroni and cheese recipe I've tried to make and will be the only one I ever try.  It was SO good;  it was very creamy (not at all gritty) and awesomely cheesy.  I did add a 1/4 cup more Velveeta, just to up the cheese flavor and it turned out great.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very creamy and was pretty good.  But there is something missing in the flavor.  Just can't put my finger on it.  Did not care for the breadcrumbs or parm. cheese on top.  I will try adding another cheese with more flavor to the mix next time.  Good basic recipe.  I am going to up this to five stars, I halfed the velvetta, and added colby jack cheese in its place.  The kids loved it. Also I do not like toppings on my mac so cooked only on the stove and did not bake. Flavor was great.  While we had several friends over for dinner one night and us girls were making dinner we decided to try pepper jack cheese in place of half of the velveeta to it as a lark for more of a kick for the adults. While the guys grossed us out by eating the mac and cheese on ritz crackers us girls liked the extra little kick that the peppers gave to the mac.  Please remember it comes down to ones personal preference with recipes submitted.

wow you'd think with all that cheese this recipe calls for (i even added more), that it would actually taste cheesey... well it does NOT. taste like flour and very bland.  frozen stoufers or even the box kind with the foil pouch of velveta are much better tasting than this!  cheaper too!

Awesome macaroni and cheese.  This is the recipe I have been looking for.  I have tried 3 different mac and cheese recipes in the last 3 months and this one is the winner, hands down- the other ones didn't come close in comparison.  This will be become a recipe to hand down to my children!

My three-year-old's exact words were "Mommy, this is the most scrumptious mac and cheese I've ever had!".  Can't argue with that!  The only thing I did different was add the milk before the flour and salt, as the first time I did it as stated and ended up with little dumplings swimming in milk.  It was much smoother by adding the flour to the milk, rather than the milk to the flour.  But this will be a new staple in our house with two little kids!

I just thought this was okay.  I'm not a fan of processed cheese at all.  The texture of the sauce was great, but was too bland.  I will give this recipe another chance but I'll not do a crumb topping, maybe use a sharper cheese, more spices....something.  Needs more flavor!

This mac and cheese is super good. Very heavy but it's great if that's what you're looking for! I followed Breeze's suggestions (click on "most helpful" above the comments and they should be on top of that list) but be careful with that shake of cayenne. Shook a bit too much once and although it didn't show up much when it was first served, the leftovers were much hotter :) The ritz crackers, I think, are a wonderful addition to this. They make it sooooooooooooo good :)

This is great!!  A family favorite.  My husband suggested topping the mac & cheese with bacon bits instead of the bread crumbs and this was a much bigger hit than with the bread crumbs.  Either way, it's excellent!!

Sorry but I was not impressed with this recipe.  I usually make another one but decided to try this one because of all the reviews.  The Velveeta makes it taste like box mac and cheese.  Sorry just my take on it.

Just what mac & cheese is supposed to be: creamy and cheesey.  I made this for a potluck at work, and I think I doubled the recipe.  I cooked the macaroni til almost done, mixed it all together, and took it to work in a crockpot.  It took longer to heat up than I anticipated, but ended up fine.  It disappeared!  A keeper for sure.

In our world, macaroni and cheese is a main dish instead of a side dish. This is the best macaroni and cheese I've EVER had - creamy, cheesy, simple and delicious. The changes I made were to halve the butter and flour, and about 1 1/3 cups of milk instead of two, and skipped the bread crumb/oven step entirely. Great recipe; you can't miss with this one!

Okay, this was the best mac&cheese I have made. I doubled the recipe, sauteed onion and garlic w/the butter before adding the flour. I also added diced ham w/the cheeses. Baked in a 9x13 glass dish. Yummy!!

This certainly satisfied my craving for macaroni and cheese! The only problem I had with it is that I think it was a little too "pasty". The flour thickening could be reduced a bit to make the dish more creamy.

The only change I made was to add a dash of cayanne pepper.  This was good, but I noticed a hint of flour flavor in it, so next time I would add more butter to the roux.  I don't think the bread crumbs or the additional cheese on top added anything.  I like that you did not have to pre-boil the macaroni.

I have tried many mac and cheese recipes in the past and this is hands down, THE BEST!  I made it twice in one week and used left over ham from Christmas.  My family raved!  I also used Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs.  So good!  Try this one!

Great macaroni and cheese recipe, and you can add all of those little extras that make it your own.  I used extra cheese and then I had to make more noodles... everyone loved it though!
My three-year-old didn't want to wait for it to bake so he ate it after everything was mixed together.

This is my new favorite macaroni and cheese... and macaroni and cheese is my favorite food!  We replaced the milk with one cup of evaporated milk and one cup water, and we left out the breadcrumbs and last tablespoon of butter(/margarine).  This was delightful to make (so smooth and creamy!) and is being called for an encore just three days later.  Thank you!

Superb!  The basic recipe is great, but it needed some extra "frills".  I used double the amount of velveeta, added some garlic powder to taste, stirred on some thinly sliced cheddarwurst sausage (hillshire farms brand) directly into the cheese mixture just before adding in the macaroni noodles and I used 1 1/2 cups of breadcrumbs (soaked in 1 1/2 cups of milk for 5 minutes) and spread the breadcrumbs over the top of the whole casserole just before putting it into the oven for the 20 minute baking.

I made this for a potluck lunch at work & everyone raved about it.  No one ever asks for my recipes, but several people asked about this one!  Instead of melting the cheese in the saucepan & baking, I mixed it in a crockpot & cooked on low for a few hours.  Delicious!

I've made a couple of different mac and cheese recipes and this is by far the worst.  I followed the directions exactly and it had a "prepared" type taste to it worse than what you would get from the plain old boxed kind.

Did this a bit differently and only cooked on the stove and not in the oven. Left out the flour mixture as well as the salt, cheddar cheese and breadcrumbs. Added worchestershire sauce, dry ground mustard, white pepper and used a whole box of Walmart brand processed cheese. My kids were amazed that you could make macaroni and cheese without it coming from a box. This is how my mother always made it for me. Tonight's meal made me feel like a kid again.

LOVE IT!  I've made this soo many times... Ok, here are my changes... I use all the grated cheese for the sauce and grate more later for the top. I omit the bread crumbs and use Panko seasoned with Italian seasoning and ground pepper, just because I prefer the crunch.  I also use all extra sharp cheddar... add some ground mustard, Worsteshire sauce and hot sauce to the cheese sauce... 

I've made this the original way... It was really good as is, but I kind of made this to my preference... A good basic recipe but even better to build on!

It's definitely rich and creamy!  If it's too creamy for your tastes, thin it out with some milk.  Mac and Cheese is one of my favorites of all time.  Only a special recipe would get 5 stars outta me!!

This is a great recipe, my first time making it and my family ate it all up~!  

I would suggest not cooking the pasta too throughly.  just 80~90 percent ready and so that it could cooked later in the oven in the cheese sauce. the macaroni will turn out al dente.  could also use less salt for those who don't like their dish too salty.

This was good. I made it for a group of kids and they loved it. I am not a processed cheese fan so it was not my favorite. I did ad about 1/2 cup more noodles because 2 cups did not look like enough BUT when it was baked, it soaked up all the cheese and 2 cups would have been perfect!

This is an easy, no frills macaroni & cheese recipe--similar to the one my mother has used for years.  I've made this a few times, and do modify it.  I double the recipe and use 1 lb. of pasta.  Also, I use all extra-sharp cheddar with no Velveeta.  I also usually add diced ham--1 to 1 1/2 cups--delicious.  The bread crumbs I just sprinkle on top--I don't melt with additional butter and it tastes just fine.  It also tastes great with wheat germ sprinkled on top (and there's extra fiber, too!)

Really good recipe, but I wanted REALLY CHEESY macaroni - I would make it again, but after dumping into the baking pan, I would cut up chunks of velveeta and "push" them into the mix.  But otherwise, it really was a good recipe!  ANOTHER NOTE:  You can also put this in a crock pot on a setting according to how long before you want to serve it.  Low setting - about 3 hours before you want to serve it.  I doubled the recipe and put it in the crock pot and it came out great - and fed a LOT of people who raved about it.  I've cooked this tons of time and I always add more cheese than what it is called for.

This was a wonderful mac and cheese.  It is similar to the Mueller's "back of the box" recipe, but the added velveeta makes it much creamier, and we loved the breadcrumb topping.

This was the 1st mac and cheese I ever made.  I made it for a christmas lunch at work, everyone loved it.  The prep time was a little longer than 10 mins. though.  I will definately use this recipe forever.

Most of the complaints I have seen regard blandness and pastiness.  After reading a zillion reviews and making this for a few years, I think we have perfected it.  Cheese and noodles don't have much flavor on their own, spices you add will make the difference.  I add garlic powder, a dash of cayenne, and a few shakes of Tabasco sauce (enhances flavor) I have followed the advice of previous reviewers regarding whisking constantly.  I also use a mix of milk and heavy cream which makes an even creamier sauce.  More cheese is a must-and in place of the crackers I sprinkle more cheese on top.  My father in law paid this the ultimate compliment by saying this macaroni and cheese tasted just like the kind his grandmother used to make!

I made this exactly how it was written, which at that time I gave it 4 stars.  Then I made it again a week later and changed it bit by not adding any flour and just melting the cheese, butter and some milk.  Then after that, I mixed it in with the macaroni and then added a full bag of monterey cheese and then added a half bag of mild cheddar on top.....hey...can't have enough cheese....the more....the better!!  Once it was done cooking in the oven.....it turned into a whole lot of love.......5 stars all the way!!!

Nowhere near enough cheese in this.  I followed the recipe but took it out of the oven for minute to get some for my son.  When I tasted it it mostly tasted of milk and flour.  I quickly grated a block of sharp cheddar and mixed that in and put it back in the oven for the rest of the recommended baking time.  The extra cheese helped a lot but had I served it as the recipe directs, everyone would have been disappointed besides my 4 yr. old who likes bland.  If I were to make this again, I would definitely double the cheese.

This hits the spot, and is easy.  I added a dash of garlic salt, cayenne pepper and dry mustard while melting the cheese just for an extra little zip.  Will use this recipe as my GO TO recipe for mac and cheese.

My family and I really love this mac and cheese. I like to add some black pepper and minced onion to the sauce. Also instead of bread crumbs on top I use crushed Ritz crackers mixed with some melted butter. So good!

I made this recipe a few times and it always is a big hit.  It goes a long way and it reheats beautifully too.

Very good macaroni and cheese.  My family did not care for the bread crumb topping.  Next time I will leave that off.

My family really liked this.  It was very cheesey and had a good homemade flavor.  I'm giving it four stars on;y because it did not have a smooth texture.

Very good, very simple. Kids love it, and it is richer than the box mac n cheese. I've also added cajun spices to give it a little zing.

I've been making this for few years now. Recipe is already great as it is, which is why I rated at 5 Stars but I've since made a few minor modifications. I add both extra Veleveeta and Sharp Cheddar. I've ommitted the breadcrumbs and instead use extra cheddar sprinkled across the top. I also leave it in the oven longer at a lower temperature until the cheese is crusty on top. Yummy! (I love fried cheese!) I get great feedback everytime I serve this, no matter what the modifications. Although the crusty top seems to be a consistent favorite. Thanks Kraft!

This really is the best Mac & Cheese.  I have made this several times.  Most recently for my in-laws.  My father-in law always said he didn't like mac & cheese.  Well we almost had to take it away from him!!  I usually double the recipe, and follow the suggestions Breeze made.  Thanks, we really enjoy it!

The best mac and cheese recipe I have found.  My family doesn't care for the bread topping so I omit it.  I add less velvetta cheese and more sharp shredded cheese. I also add more macaroni so the recipe isn't so liquidy. My kids who normally won't touch macaroni and cheese just love it.

I've found the perfect mac n'cheese recipe that's better than the box! The only thing I would do differently next time is reduce the salt by a bit. Otherwise, it was PERFECT. Also, I didn't add any extra cheese to the top. Just the bread crumbs with butter.

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  It's just classic creamy mac n cheese.  I even like it without the topping.  As a matter of fact I had some at a restaurant I was trying to duplicate and this seems to be it.  It's easy, too.  A teenage friend of mine helped me make it the first time and has done it on her own for her family because she loved it so much, too!  Thanks for the recipe.  I don't think I could live without it.

This was plain but tasted like classic macaroni and cheese.  I will not be making this again though as all three of my kids did not like this.  They have never liked macaroni and cheese and apparently still don't.

Yummy, yummy, yummy.  Creamy, cheesey, satisfying.   I used rotini pasta (probably could've used almost 3 cups uncooked--very saucy).  I also replaced 1/2 cup of the cheddar with provalone, and added pepper, a dash of onion powder, and a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes.

Very good recipes. Tried it for Easter. Everyone raved about it. I cooked mine about 30 minutes though because after only 20 minutes it still looked kind of runny and I wanted it to be thicker. It's really just a matter of preference.

You can mix around with the cheeses sharp cheese,mozzarella cheese,monterey jack and it works well for a change of pace. I made it once in an aluminum foil pan instead of the glass dish and it came out a little drier, so it's back to the glass dish.

I added more Velveta and about 1/4 t of dry mustard. I think I'd also add some kind of hot sauce or more spicy seasoning the next time I make this. It was very good but could use a bit more flavor.

I was looking for a basic macaroni and cheese recipe and this is definitely it! I used shells instead of elbows and didn't bake it (we were hungry).  Definitely way too much sauce for the amount of pasta suggested - but I guess it would have decreased had I baked it.  All in all, a very good basic mac n' cheese recipe.  This is definitely a keeper.

Wish I could give it 10 stars! Made it, using Breze's tweaks, and took it to work for a potluck (double rcipe). It was the biggest hit of the year! The Accounting Section of the King County (WA) Department of Assessments would probably give it 20 stars! Thanks for a real WINNER...tonight I'm making it again so the hubby can taste this wonderful stuff! You rock Kraft and Breze!!!!!!!

This was very good.  I am not usually a big fan of mac and cheese but my husband loves it so I decided to try this recipe and I was very impressed with it.  It was very creamy and I loved the bread crumbs.  It added that little extra something.  I think I might actually like mac and cheese now.  Pretty impressive.

this was SOO good and i refuse to make the mac and cheese from the box because i detest it. i tried another macaroni and cheese recipe on this site but it just turned out gritty, not smooth like this one!.
i didn't have any elbow macaroni so i just used rotini.
i had to use a lot more pasta though because there was a LOT of cheese sauce. maybe it would have been different if i baked it or used the elbow macaroni? (but i rather not bake it because i'm sure it would come out drier)  i added more noodles as i mixed and it came to about 4 1/2 cups of the cooked rotini.
i also added pepper.
next time i think i'll add some peas.

This was great - creamy and smooth. I used more macaroni noodles and added some salt and pepper, and next time I would top it with corn flakes or something crunchier - the bread crumbs gave it a weird grainy texture when I ate it as leftovers.

Very good and more importantly - very easy!  I cut the recipe in half, since I live by myself.  It's very creamy and smooth.  A great base recipe to add in spices, like chili powder, hot sauce or tiny bit of dijon mustard.  I might make a little less sauce to the macaroni is coated, not swimming in the cheese.  Overall - super tasty!

I was a bit disappointed in the way this turned out. I followed the recipe exactly and it just wasn't the taste I was looking for and it was a bit dry. I will try again so maybe it will turn out better next time. Not worth the calories...

I found this recipe last week, and I've made it 4 times already! My whole family loves it.
The only thing that I changed was adding an extra 2oz of Velveeta.

This is an easy recipe that is always a favorite.  I serve it with a ham steak that I cover with maple syrup, brown sugar and sliced apples.  The ham steak and Mac and Cheese cook in about the same time.

This recipes is very good. I only had Shredded Cheddar and Colby which worked fine.  I also added a some pepper to the flour & milk mixture.  I put extra breadcrumbs on top since we like a crunchy top. My kids and husband really liked it alot. It is a great comfort food on a cold winter night. We used it as a meal not a side dish.  Will make again.

WOW! What a recipe! I doubled it and it made a huge pan, and by the end of the night, it was scraped clean! I did add some garlic powder to give it a little kick, but that was the only thing I changed. This has been added to the keeper pile!!!

It turned out ok, but it tasted way to salty. Maybe I will try it again without any salt, but after all the rave reviews, I expected it to be better. Maybe it was just me...

This is just the kind of mac & cheese recipe I was looking for.  I did as other reviewers suggested & doubled the amount of pasta & it was still plenty cheesy.  My family who is very much a Kraft boxed family, loved this too!

This is a really good recipe. I didn't have any velveta cheese so I used canned cheddar cheese and I used a combination of cheddar/jack. This was my 1st time making mac n cheese and let me tell you it came out really well despite the fact that I didn't have the ingredients called for in the recipe. My family loved it! I will make this again.

I added 1/4 cup finely chopped onions to the butter and sauteed for a few minutes before adding the flour. I used half of the flour called for and cooked for a good 3-4 minutes, then I added 1 cup fat free half & half and 1 cup 1% milk, then the cheeses and macaroni. I then added about 1 cup chopped ham (leftover Honey Baked Ham, YUM!!) This is where I tasted it and it was GREAT!! I didn't add the extra cheese on top, but I did proceed to add the seasoned bread crumbs to the top before baking.....I really should have left it alone. I did not like the gritty texture. It wasn't throughout the dish but it would have been much better without it. There is really no need to bake this dish unless you add the toppings or prefer to have crunchier pasta. I will definately make this again.

Great flavor, very creamy. I accidentally burned my first batch by overcooking in the oven, but was able to salvage it by adding milk a few cups of milk. No one at Thanksgiving knew what a catastrophe it could have been. I cooked my second batch the next day and even after sitting in the refrigerator overnight it came out beautifully and still creamy. I highly recommmend this recipe.

This was good.  I doubled the recipe,however I forgot to double the shredded cheese.  It was still good, but will be better next I make it correctly.  There was no need for me to double the recipe it made to much for a family of 2 1/2.  I've never has mac and cheese with bread crumbs on top, it was wonderful!  nice and crunchy.

This recipe is sure to please every Mac & Cheese lover, young and old!  For a healthier version, I used reduced fat Velveeta and Cheddar cheeses.  I used 1% milk (only about a cup and a half), and aprox. 3 tablespoons of butter instead of a 1/4 cup.  I also used reduced fat Ritz crackers for the topping instead of bread crumbs, and the recipe still came out rich and creamy!  For something different, I also threw in some cut up chicken hot dogs, for a hot dog macaroni casserole....Yummy!

This was way too runny.  The sauce was thick enough, but I had to add a lot more macaroni to get rid of the "soupiness".  Tasted great then.

This was good considering it was made from "scratch".  Almost reminded me of the boxed version of Velveeta mac n cheese.  I added more pasta (2 cups didn't seem like it would be enough), more salt, a teaspoon of garlic powder, and a teaspoon of onion powder to the cheese mixture.  My husband commented that it was too cheesy but he helped himself to three servings and took the leftovers with him to work!  Not your usual "southern style" macaroni and cheese but will probably make again.

This recipe is "a keeper".  Because it doesn't include eggs as many baked macaroni and cheese recipes do, it doesn't have the custard-y texture that I find unappealing.  Instead it is very creamy, with a lovely crunch on the top (I use cornflake crumbs for the topping).  Just stir in a bit of milk when reheating - that is, if you have any leftovers!

First off, the directions give no indication as to what temp to cook the butter, flour, milk mixture until thickened.  If I hadn't been so impatient, I wouldn't have turned the heat up and discovered that it has to be above low heat to thicken.

Overall, the taste was not that great.  Not very creamy and you could still taste the flour in it.

I will stick to the box dinner from Kraft instead of ever making this again.

This was really the best mac & cheese recipe I have tried. I added some garlic & onion powders to the recipe and made it with little shells instead of elbows. I served it with ribs, salad and corn when we had family over for a cookout. I received a ton of compliments and everyone went back for seconds. This ones a keeper. Thanks Kraft!

Excellent, but I actually made a lot of changes.  First, I added about 1/2 chopped onion to the butter and sauteed before adding the flour.  Then I substituted 1 cup of the milk with one cup of dry sherry.  I don't use Velveeta, just stick with the cheddar.  Finally I skipped the butter on top and add the bread crumbs covered with the cheddar so they don't burn.  I can't get enough of this and it is my 21 month old daughter's favorite mac & cheese too!

This was AWESOME!  Easy and delicious, it's the best baked mac & cheese recipe I've tried.  I did have to sub sliced white American cheese for the Velveeta and I added some crushed saltines to the top in addition to the bread crumbs.  This will be the recipe I use over and over!

This mac and cheese is easy and delicious!  My fiance asks me to make it for him at least once a week.  I omit the bread crumbs because I prefer it a little cheesier.  It tastes great leftover with a little bit of milk and butter added.

I made this tonight for my husband (the authority on Mac and Cheese) and he loved it.  I made it exactly as directed and it came out very delicious and creamy.  Next time I will use more velveeta, but that is just my personal preference.  My 2 year old son even asked for seconds.  Definitely a keeper in my recipe box.

This was pretty good, I found that it needed seasoning.  I may have forgotten to add the salt now that I look at the recipe.  Anyway, I added a little dijon mustard, and cayenne pepper.  VERY CREAMY!

I tried this recipe based upon the good reviews.  I was a little disappointed as it was kind of bland, in my opinion.  I found that I kept adding things to zip it up a little bit.  I also didn't care for using the flour/butter starter.  I didn't care for the texture.

Wonderful mac and cheese! I doubled the recipe and lightened it up both in calories and carbs. I used low-carb penne, low-fat & low-carb milk and reduced fat cheddar cheese. I skipped the bread crumb topping and just added a little extra grated cheddar on top. Really good, everyone loved it. Now we just have to control our portion size - everyone wanted seconds! :)

Pretty good. It is almost too cheesy if that is possible. It does fill the bill for homemade macaroni and cheese. I am still looking for the perfect old fashioned mac & Cheese.

This is a good basic mac and cheese recipe but it needs a little tweaking. The taste of the cheddar was too strong and I even cut it down to one and a half cups.  Next time I will add a little more velveeta and less cheddar.  Also I added some seasoning salt and parsley, which made the flavor better.

This recipe was a hit at christmas dinner.  I used crumbled ritz crackers in place of bread crumbs as topping.  Easier than the recipe makes it sound.

This is a very cheesy macaroni and cheese! The Velveeta gives it just enough smoothness. The last time I made this, I used the jumbo elbow macaroni and it turned out excellent!

This is a very good mac n' cheese. You must eat it right away tho while it is still creamy. The macaroni soaks up the sauce if you let it sit. I made a few changes.....added a little extra velveeta, added onion powder and salt and pepper to the sauce and a sprinkling of cayanne to the bread crumb mixture. We had this with a garden salad and warm bread loaf. A nice fall meal.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  I used a can of evaporated milk which was about 1 1/3 cups of the 2 cups of milk the recipe called for.  Used milk for the remainder.  I will definitely make this again soon!

This was an awesome recipe!!  I made my own bread crumbs by taking pieces of bread and toasting them and then throwing them under the broiler for a minute... So good.  I also cut up red peppers very small and fresh jalepenos and added them to the macaroni.  Added cayenne and pepper to spice it up.  Finally, added bratwurst sausage...  This was sooo good and sooooo cheesy (I added a little extra velveeta).  We ate the whole 6 servings by the next morning.... great midnight snack!  In fact, we are making it again tomorrow.

For years I wouldn't touch any macaroni and cheese that didn't come out of a box. The other recipes I've tried were bland and dull. This one was cheesy and creamy and just plain wonderful! I made it for a lunch I was having with some girlfriends and they loved it! One had to have the recipe to make it for her husband. I can't wait for my husband to try it tonight! Oh, and I added a ts of garlic powder and omitted the bread crumbs because I didn't have any on hand. I will definitely be making this again.

This is the best mac and cheese. I used Velveeta light and put in closer to three cups of macaroni, and the dish was still plenty rich and cheesy.

This was yummy.  We never eat macaroni and cheese, but I figured I would try it.  I omitted the salt, used Velveeta light and added tomatoes and jalapeno peppers.  Great comfort food.  Thanks for the recipe.

Pretty good, I'd say.  My family eats it up.  I gave it a 4 only because I'm not a fan of processed cheeses for good health, so I don't make this too often.  It really is pretty tasty, though.

My family enjoyed this as a main dish.  I used about 3/4 of a 16 oz box of elbow macaroni, and used an 8 oz block of Velveeta cheese.  I didn't add any shredded cheddar to the mix, and I added about a generous tablespoon of spicy brown mustard to the milk mixture, as well as some black pepper.  I just sprinkled some dry breadcrumbs over the top, didn't feel the need to add butter to them since the macaroni already had plenty of cheese, and it turned out great!  Add a salad and a hot veg and you have an easy, nutritious meal!

My grandpa is a very fussy eater and likes his southern homecooked meals. He is always happy to hear when I'm making this! Always a favorite with the rest of the family and has become a staple at our parties. I'm just a beginner and its great when everyone compliments on this recipe!

I had never ventured outside the well known blue mac n cheese box, so I was skeptical.  I thought there was more work to making homemade macaroni & cheese, but this recipe proved otherwise.  Dispite the constant stirring to prevent scalding, this turned out great!  My husband liked, I liked, it was just plain 'ol good.

This recipe was "ok". I wouldn't say it's out of this world by far like some other people thought.
I kept tasting this bland 'floury' taste. I think this recipe could be tweaked and turned into something alot better. I'll keep searching for the kind of mac-n-cheese recipe I have in mind.

This was really good.  It was really creamy and rich.  I added extra breadcrumbs to the top just because we really like them.  I will definitely be making this many more times.  We loved it!

I just made this tonight (and I am only just starting to learn to cook!).  This was so easy and so wonderful - even my Father and my husband, neither of which like Mac & Cheese, loved this recipe!!!  I doubled the recipe and I took the advice of others and did half Velveeta and half Sharp Cheddar, added some ground black pepper and tripled the bread crumbs (my family loves the crunchy bread crumbs on top!).  I baked it at 375 for 10 mins, then 350 for a half hour.  It was awesome!!!

Because of the convenience of pre-packaged mac 'n cheese you can buy at the supermarket, I haven't had much opportunity to taste real homemade macaroni and cheese. Compared to the few recipes I've tasted before, this one is the best. The only things I changed was that I used cheddar cheese instead of the Velveeta, and used Penne pasta instead of elbow macaroni. It turned out great and I'll continue to use this recipe!

I looked for a great mac and cheese recipe for a long time and this is it! I often double this recipe for potlucks and bbqs and it's always a big hit. I follow the advice of others and sub all cheddar for the Velveeta and don't cook the noodles completly before baking. A real crowd pleaser!

well even my absent mindedness couldn't mess up this recipe. it was awesome! i put in the oven as directed for 20 minutes. it didn't say whether to cover it or not so i left it uncovered. after twenty minutes the bread crumb topping had not browned how i would like it to, so i set it for another ten minutes. still not brown so i decided to flip on the broiler to give it that nice toasty brown top. well, i walked away and forgot about it. i burned tthe top! i was heart broken. i scooped off the burnt topping and hoped for the best, and it was awesome! so creamy and cheesy! and much less expensive the the four cheese type macaroni recipes. just a note, i cut the boiling time in half for the macaroni. good thing since i ended up baking it much longer the recipe called for. i can't wait for next time so i can have the toasty bread crumb topping, too!

Very easy and very good!  I used 1% milk, velveeta, and only 2 Tbsp. of butter, and it was yummy.  I also used ziti pasta instead of elbows.  Everyone thought it was delicious.  I did not need the final 1/2 cup of cheese on the top, as it was already cheesy enough.  Thanks KF!

Very good. I omitted the 1 teaspoon salt called for, chesse has enough salt in it already. The only thing I would do different is  try a different chesse then cheddar. It was VERY salty, but cheddar is. I am thinking maybe swiss would be good, or even mozzarella. Or maybe I can find a lower sodium cheddar. My 2 year old gobbled it up!

This is a very, very good rendention of homeade mac-n-cheese.  My husband said that it was the best that he has ever had.  I omitted the topping to please my 4 yr. old & everything turned out great even without the topping.  This is definitely a crowd pleaser & VERY cheesy.

This was excellent. I was in the mood for comfort food and this filled the bill.  I added  garlic powder and taco seasoning to give it some spice. I also doubled the crumb topping.

This is the best mac and cheese we've ever had! My husband is a big fan of box mixes and has never like homemade before, and I dislike the box mixes; this is wonderfully creamy like the mixes but with a genuine wonderful wholesome cheesy flavor. We used pasta shells and I also added onion powder, pepper, and a pinch of garlic powder. Oh, I also used bacon fat rather than butter (it sounds so unhealthy but fat is fat!) and it added wonderful flavor. What a great recipe- definitely a keeper!

This was okay, but I have to agree with someone else that the topping was very greasy, and really kind of turned my off.

Prep time is a little under-estimated.  But this was YUMMY!!!!!  I used sharp cheddar cheese & added 1/2 tsp paprika & 1/2 tsp garlic powder (but will probably cut that back a little next time) for a little extra zing.  Definately a keeper!!

The only thing I make sure to do is use sharp cheddar - it makes it cheesier tasting.  Also, I don't mix the 1/2 cup cheese with the bread crumbs, I just mix all the cheese in the sauce & put the bread crumbs tossed with butter only on the top.  My kids say this is the best mac & cheese ever & so do my niece & nephew.

Bravo!  We brought this to a Thanksgiving potbless and my husband was embarrased that we brought mac-n-cheese.  Needless to say, it was the first thing to go and people were fighting over the very last scrap on the bottom!  Wonderful!  Not just for the kids, that's for sure!

Very good altho I feel it lacked a bit of flavor. I added a handful of sharp cheddar & that seemed to do the trick so I would just sub the cheddar w/sharp cheddar next time.

This is the real deal mac and cheese.  The part I struggle with each time I make it is (besides how it isn't the healthiest for you....is there doesn't seem to be enough pasta for the cheese sauce (almost like there is more cheese sauce than pasta).  I wish I was like the other reviewer and just went with it but I did double the pasta.  Taste is still the best...a little sticky but then I added some of the water from boiling my broccoli to it and it was not as sticky.  My husband loved it, one child thought it was too cheese and the other child didn't eat as much because it is pretty filling!

I loved this recipe.  I absolutely hate Mac and Cheese recipes that call for egg so this was perfect.  What I loved most about it was the fact that it heated up perfectly and wasn't oily.  It is perfectly creamy and rich!

I am still searching for the perfect homemade macaroni and cheese recipe.  This was not it.  I doubled the recipe for a birthday party.  I didn't bake it and kept it warm in the slow cooker.  It was creamy but wasn't as cheesy tasting as I would like.  It almost reminded me of the mac & cheese served at school that was very bland.

This is pretty much exactly how I make my mac and cheese, except I use a pound of elbow macaroni (or wagon wheels), double the sauce and use all velveeta (like 1 pound total). Sometimes I'll add a little garlic powder and season salt for extra flavor and I ALWAYS add fresh ground black pepper. This recipe is outstanding....creamy, rich and delicious! This is usually a meal for us on it's own! :)

I've used this recipe for over six years...I've never gotten more compliments on any dish. I do alter the recipe. I do not use the bread crumbs and I use a combination of muenster, sharp cheddar, monterey jack, and velveeta. I use more sharp cheddar than the rest. I use half of the velveeta the recipe calls for and sub the muenster in place. I also boil the pasta noodles with salt and use black pepper. I do not bake the mac and cheese for too long as it looses it's creaminess. Also watch if leaving in the crock pot for too long/too high as it will also loose creaminess. Very easy to make and my kids and I love making it together. The constant stirring with a big spoon, the shredding of the cheese, and dropping it handfull by handful is like a ritual for me and my boys who are now teenagers.

Ive made this several times but finally got around to rating the recipe.  Make sure you constantly stir or the cheese will stick to the bottom of the pot in a matter of seconds.  This is a great side for any hearty meal.

I didn't do the breadcrumb topping becuase I don't care for it, but followed recipe otherwise. I had 1/4 lb. of velveta to use up and what better way to use it than mac and cheese. My 4 yo would not touch this and when she finally took a bite she spit it out. LOL She does not like mac and cheese made with the roux. My 19 month old loved it she ate hers and the rest of her sisters. I thought it was just ok. The best part was the top layer of cheese that was melted the rest of it wasn't all that great. I'm still on the quest to find a recipe that's like the boxed kind. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe can easyly be doubled, but for me, I use an extra cup of milk. For the first pan I make the macaroni and cheese as recipe says without the breadcrumbs. To me macaroni and cheese as a dish doesn't need breadcrumbs, but just a few minutes under the broiler after it is done. The second dish I add cooked chopped chicken and throw in frozen peas, that are still frozen, and do not bake this one, but put it in the freezer for a future meal.

This wonderful recipe redefines "macaroni and cheese" for many people. Absolutely "craveworthy," to quote my son. You have to try it to believe it! Easier than it looks. We cooked it for a family reunion in a church kitchen after a 900 mile drive, and it still came out great! We added chunks of fried Spam, and now we always do. We didn't even bake it and it was still perfect!

I have been making this recipe for a few months now.  My kids love this more than the boxed, and even my husband goes nuts over it.  I add ham from time to time to make it a complete meal rather than to have another meat with it, and cook up some veggies with it.  Made it about a week ago, and my kids raved about it again and were thrilled I made it up.  My daughter loves to help make this, it is rather easy.

The 5 Star rating is based on following the June 5, 2005 review by Breeze.  I made the recipe with the alterations exactly as Breeze suggested and it was absolutely fantastic!  My significant other said it was the best homemade macaroni and cheese he had ever had...even better than his mom and grandma's which is definitely saying something.  I do not know how this recipe is as written, but with the alterations compiled by Breeze, it was superb!

I actually found this recipe on the Kraft website quite a few years ago and it's been my go-to mac & cheese ever since. I always use more cheese than this calls for...we like it VERY cheesy, and I always make extra because it's really good as the next day's lunch. My husband can get enough of it and I always take it to family functions, where everyone loves it. Overall, I don't think I've ever tasted a better mac & cheese:)

I have used this recipe for years!  I always double it (using a whole 16 oz. box of elbow macaroni) as well as doubling the American cheese (so that I use a full pound).  I add 3 cups of shredded sharp cheddar to the sauce and reserve the last cup for the topping.  I don't add butter to the bread crumbs, I just sprinkle it on top of the cheese until the top of a 9x13 inch pan is well covered.  Here is a suggestion!  Add your left-over ham or kielbasa! YUMMY

This was very creamy and my family seemed to like it. No ooohs and ahhhs. I thought it was just a bit bland despite the tweaks I read in another review, garlic salt, cayenne pepper, mustard powder... The next time I make mac & cheese from scratch I will look for a recipe without velveeta.

My family loves this recipe. I don't use the bread crumbs as my husband doesn't like them added. I have made it for several of my family get togethers. I bake it as it instructs but don't put the cheese on top. Then I use crock pot liners and put it in my crock pot on warm. It's always the first thing gone. I wish I could find a bigger crock pot so I could triple the recipe.

this was really good but couldnt make the bread crumbs portion work out correctly.  the butter and crumbs ended up as one tablespoon of a thick paste-like substance.  I followed the original recipe and it was great, however next time i will top it with more shredded cheese and bread crumbs.  it was delicious but it's a hard sell with kids.  they want the orange kraft mac n cheese in the box.

I'm not a big fan of mac and cheese, but my bf is, so I make this occasionally.  He really likes it, and I can deal with eating it, so I'm giving it five stars.  I do like the bread crumbs on top, but omit them if you don't like them.  It's relativley easy to make, and I usually add garlic and Italian spices to the sauce to spice it up a little.

I've been making this for years and finally decided to rate it.  My family loves it!  I never have leftovers, people usually have seconds and thirds!!
It's good enough to serve on Thanksgiving, as I am doing!  I do add about 1/2 c. more cheddar.  Enjoy!!!

Maybe this is a 3 1/2 for us.  The taste was good but we all prefer our Mac & Cheese to be saucier.  It was ok.  Two of the kids did not finish their servings.  If you like your Mac on the dryer side this would be good.

Very good. I added ham chunks to mine because my husband likes it that way. I will tweak it a little to make it the way I like it too. Pretty easy to make, just be careful of the cheese sauce so you don't overcook it.

I'm always asked to bring this to parties (along w/the broccoli tortellini salad i found on this site).  I add a couple of cloves of minced garlic when i add the cheeses and a can of italian stewed tomatoes (crushed a little) when i combine the cheese w/the pasta.  Always yummy!

Very tasty macaroni and cheese. I gave 4/5 only because I'm not a huge fan of Velveeta nor bread crumbs on my mac. I tried this out for a friend who absolutely loved it. It does make for a very creamy mac and cheese, though. If that's what you're looking for then this recipe is for you!

Love this recipe, in my family favs. Be sure to not overcook.
A friend of mine adds all kinds of things depending on what she has on hand, peas & ham, or onions & chicken, making it a full dinner.

I thought this was very tasty (and easy) for homemade mac & cheese.  My only complaint was that the sauce tasted a little grainy to me.  I made sure to cook the flour fully in the butter before adding the milk.  I'm not sure if I used too much flour or if it was my cooking technique.  Either way, the flavor was great!

Next time I might use plain bread crumbs instead of the seasoned ones.

Gave it 3 stars because the husband and I were not fans of this.  We like the more old fashioned baked macaroni.  My children liked, which is why I gave it the average.  Reminded me of what I do when the kids want some quick mac and cheez (through some milk, velvetta, butter spray and noodles together)

I really liked the bread crumb topping - it added an extra nice crunch. The blend of 2 cheeses was also good too.

This is the best mac and cheese recipe!!!  I have brought this to work and have gotten rave reviews from everyone.  There is never any left over.  I usually add more bread crumbs and butter to the top then called for.  Definitely try this recipe, it will be the only one you make from now on, I know it's the only one I will ever use!!

This was delicious!!!

I made it for my mom, who has like one of the world's best homemade mac -n -chesse recipes (her's calls for Cream of Mushroom) and my dad, who never really eats anyone's cooking but Mom's and they BOTH loved it.  I used buttered bread crumbs.  Layered another bag of shredded cheese down and it turned out so rich and creamy.

Thanks, KRAFT!

My kids loved this!  I made it for my son's birthday since he wanted mac n cheese for his birthday dinner.  I found it to be a little too gooey and I left off the bread crumbs, but overall the flavor is good it is a definite winner with the kiddos!

The macaroni & cheese was excellent!  My kids and husband loved it.  I'm not a big fan of this dish, but this was really tasty and not overpowering.  It is now a tradition for any special occassion.  I also used 4 cups of macaroni as suggested, less would not have been enough.  Make sure the flour/butter/milk mixture thicken, it takes awhile.

Ok, I have made this four times now so I feel I can give an honest opinion.  This is by far one of the BEST mac and cheese recipes I have ever made.  Like some other reviewers, I follow the doubled recipe suggestion by Breeze, with the only exception being that I will also add 1/4 cup of diced onion.  It's not doing my hips any good, but I love it anyway!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

WOW, this recipe was great, we added a little more noodles than called for, 4 cups cooked instead of 2 cups, just seemed too cheesy with only 2 cups, also added a little garlic salt, it was great. THANKS !!!!!!

..Was looking for a simple side to serve with our ribs and kabobs we grilled this weekend.  I have made my own mac and cheese in the past and it has always turned out bland...after reading all the reviews I decided this one would be different and was right! I followed the recipe except that I couldn't help but add a little garlic salt and cayenne pepper to the roux.  Everyone at the BBQ loved it!  Will put this one in my recipe book and make again...Thanks Kraft!.....Why can't your boxed mac and cheese taste this good?

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was bad.  You could taste the flour in the sauce, which made it pasty and thick.  This is definitely not going in my permanent stash.

I loved this recipe.  It was not the same as most homemades because it was super creamy and very rich. It maybe a bit too creamy and rich for someone that really likes the traditional homemade mac and cheese. I think I will try a little less velveeta and add cheddar to replace it next time.

This recipe was a big hit at a party that we had recently.  My girlfriend's grand daughter told me it wasn't macaroni and cheese because it wasn't orange.  I laughed at that, kids today don't have a clue what good home cooking is.  I served this with grilled cheese sandwiches and homemade tomato soup.  The children, who are not big eaters, all had a second helping and asked for more, the bowl was licked clean.

My kids loved this recipe. They thought it was the best ever. I thought it needed a little kick to it. Garlic, onion and mustard. It was easy and it was cheesey, but it did have a gritty texture to it. Maybe if I make it again for them I will try and cook the flour mixture longer to help with the gritty flour texture.

My family liked this mac & cheese despite the grittiness. My son hates everything and even he ate it.  I noticed that after heating the leftovers in the microwave the grittiness was gone.

This was pretty good.  I wanted to try to make my own Mac and Cheese since my husband had his own recipe.  I definitely liked mine more.  I used sharp cheddar as some suggested.  I also used a little more Velveeta than suggested.  I don't know if that was a good thing or not because it came out very thick.  I also see where people were saying it comes out gritty as mine did too but I didn't mind too much nor did my family.  I will definitely make this one again sometime.

This looked good as I was making it, but when all was said and done, it was too bland for my liking.  None of my family really liked it.  Nobody hated it, but they weren't thrilled and didn't want it again.  The consistency turned out perfect...not gritty like some say....but didn't have too much flavor.  Maybe I should've added salt or used sharper cheddar or something.  I didn't like it enough to try again and experiment with it.

My family LOVED this recipe. I took off one star because we didn't like the bread crumbs on top. The Velveeta makes it so wonderful and creamy and the cheddar takes away the total "processed cheese" taste. It is extremely rich so the batch I made lasted for a couple of left-overs.

This recipe tasted bland, though I didn't add the velveeta cheese. It tasted just like the cheese sauce my dad makes to put on pasta. Thought the topping did taste good, it added some flavour to it. Overall this is a good quick meal to make for children that are fussy.

Made this last night with the assistance of my 7 yr old son.  He loved helping make this EASY recipe...and loved the results even more!!  I added a bit more Velveeta, white pepper and dry mustard.  It was scrumptious!!  Will make over and over.

Will not make again. I ended up with the grittyness also. I stired the flour milk mix plenty. Not a bad taste just hard to eat with an icky texture.

Very good! I followed the advice of the other posters and used the cheese I had on hand (we don't eat american/velveeta), so I added swiss and cheddar. Yum. My husband said it was excellent.

This is a great mac n' cheese recipe.  My husband is very particular about his mac n' cheese and he loved it.  This has now become a regular on my menu.  Thanks!

This was a great easy recipe.  We made this for a kids party and helf of them ate it only because most kids like the box  better.  But when we had it as leftovers for a party the next day it went over well.  We used extra sharp cheddar cheese and a bit more velveta and it was well worth it.  Very creamy and not gritty like some.

I used more shredded cheese than it called for and it came out great.  I was in a hurry and didn't bake it with the bread crumbs and my family loved it.

This is a good basic recipe.  It took longer to make because slowly whisking in the flour and milk took a while.  However, the wait paid off because it came out creamy and thick.  I added more bread crumb mix to the top to make it crunchier.

This is a good recipe. I did add more cheese. Make sure that when you are cooking your flour mixture that you stir stir stir and get it as smooth as possible. This might be why some reviewers thought it had a 'grainy' texture. I also increased the velveeta to give it a more 'cheesy' consistancy. I cooked it longer than specified just to get the golden top results but it was done within the specified time. I also didn't use the bread crumbs as that is not our personal preference. I have one recipe that I like better so I won't give this one 5 stars, however, this recipe is cheaper and easier to make.

This is great for a quick lunch or as a side dish. Hubby LOVED it and he will usually only eat prepackaged mac and cheese with the powdered cheese. I did alter the recipe a tad. I didn't add the salt because I find processed cheese salty, and the end product turned out just right. Will definitely make again!

I had some mozzarella left over in my fridge, so I used that instead of Velveeta (which I couldn't find at the supermarket, oddly enough). I used an 8-oz block of extra-sharp cheddar and grated it myself. It came out to about 2 and a half cups. I didn't have to butter/grease the dish, either. It tasted great, but the texture was little weird--sort of grainy. Maybe because I didn't use Velveeta?

This was not what I was hoping for.  I used the combination of velveeta and cheddar called for, and the sauce was much too grainy and bland for my expectations.  I would possibly try the basic recipe again, but try using a milder cheese than cheddar as other reviewers have suggested.  I did use skim milk, which may have caused the sauce to be less creamy and smooth, in addition to the cheddar cheese.  I will keep looking for a great mac n' cheese recipe.

WOW!!!  My husband is not a big fan of mac-n-cheese but he LOVED this!  It was so creamy and soooo good!  I did not make the breadcrumb topping and I used a little more Velveeta than called for.  Next time I think I'll also use a little more macaroni.  This is definitely a new favorite!

This wasn't so great for my family. My brother, his family and my parents tried this out at my Christmas dinner. None of them was too thrilled with the bread crumbs crust. Would have been better without it.

this mac and cheese was absolutely awesome! my boyfriend and i were looking for a good mac and cheese recipe since we couldnt find his grandmothers and this definetly was a good substitution! this is going into regular rotation. the only thing i would suggest is to add more bread crumbs to the topping. the amount called for i think isnt enough.

This recipe was awesome.  EVERYONE I made it for loved it.  I added as suggested extra cheese (1 lb of Chedder cheese) and two half bags of a mixed four Italian shredded cheese (it was what I had), added a dash more of flour, added onion salt instead of onion itself, and also added bits of ham, celery and carrots.   I took out the bread crumbs being with what I read it seemed unnecessary. I also added a dash of cumin and some other herbs to give it a slight "kick"as I took from other reviewers. This recipe is a def keeper.

Wow. No comparison between homemade mac and cheese and the boxed junk. I love this. Good recipe. Only difference I made was using crushed Ritz crackers rather than toasting bread crumbs.

Loved it!  I didn't use cheddar cheese as I didn't have any on hand so I used all Velveeta, the 50% less fat kind, and it tasted great!!!  
I will make this again!!

This was great.  I was craving homemade mac and cheese and this was perfect.  I think I was a little impatient though waiting for it to thicken so I added more flour, which took away from the cheedar flavor.  Even so, it was delicious.

This was absolutely fabulous!  I sprinkled grated cheese on top instead of the bread crumbs and it was delicious!  I'll definitely be making this again!

To save time, I just cooked this and served from the stovetop & it was awesome!  So creamy, but of course, I added more cheese, as we love lots!  I can't wait to make it in the oven with topping mext time!

I served this as one side dish along with chicken and bar-b-que at a family gathering of 18 people.  I had just found the recipe here that day.  Out of the 18 people there, I've had about 7 already ask me for the recipe and can't believe that I made it myself!!!  It was great.  I didn't change a thing!  Even my daughter's picky-eater boyfriend raved about this one!

Okay maybe it was me...but it came out dry. I didn't want to use Velveeta so I used real cheddar. I also didn't have elbow macaroni so I used penne. It looked great until it went in the oven. That's where I will just brown the top next time because I like it creamy. Otherwise a great recipe.

This is a great recipe but a little on the bland side, so try adding white pepper, ground red cayenne pepper, black pepper, and ground dry yellow mustard to your taste.  I also added  some freshly shredded parmesan, doubled the Velveeta, and I used a mixture of Colby and Monterey Jack cheese instead of Cheddar.

Though I intended to make this for the kids at a cocktail party, quite a few adults grabbed the kids bowls and ate it too!!!  For the party, I quadrupled the recipe and added about 1/2 tsp white pepper, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 2 teaspoons of dry mustard, and a few shakes of cayenne pepper.  This came out a bit on the spicy side but it gave it a nice kick and everyone ate it.

The Velveeta makes this smoother than most baked mac and cheese recipes, with a texture closer to the "instant" variety.  Thanks!!!

I don't really like Mac & Cheese, but my wife asked me to make some "home made".  She loved it (and my 1 year old daughter did too).  I tried it, and it was very good and extremely filling.  Good stuff.

I made this for a family get together and everyone raved. The only thing I changed was to not add the breadcrumbs to the top but thinly sliced pieces of american cheese to give it a nice crusty top.

Perfect fresh out of the oven or reheated.  I used casserole elbow macaroni (they are larger than the regular) but other than that everything else was the same.  Good thing I made a double batch because there were no leftovers the first time!  I've also never had reheated mac & cheese still be moist when I reheated it except for this one.  It's a keeper.

I made two pans of this for Christmas and it was a huge hit at my house.  It definately pleases everyone and once you get going it's easy to make.  I had extra left over because I made so much and my sister asked if she could take the rest home since her kids loved it so much!

This recipe was DELICIOUS.. once we got past the whole flour part that part we found to be quite difficult and it wouldn't thicken immediately we had to turn up the heat ( I had to ask my beau to come and help me out with this recipe) but after all was said and done it came out amazingly delicious!

This recipe is very easy and delicious. Everyone loved it. My DH also liked it, he is not a Mac & Cheese kind of guy. Will surely make this again. Next time, in place of the seasoned bread crumbs, I will try the French Onions (crushed). Thank you for a great recipe.

Awesome! Isn't Velveeta just the BEST product ever??? Only change I made was to leave the cheese off the crumb topping and mix the bread crumbs with a little melted butter before sprinkling over the top. I added crushed red pepper to my serving which made it really yummy and a little more "grown up".

VERY good right out of the oven..but I premade this and warmed it up a couple hours later and it was dry. Maybe I put too much noodles as I took the advice and doubled the noodles. still good though :) thanks!

this was good.  Although the second time I made it I added about 1/3 cup chicken broth to give it a little extra saltiness and flavor, and it was better.  I think next time I'll throw in some bits of ham.

The Best ever for cheese lovers like me!  I also doubled the recipe and tweaked it with some garlic powder, onion powder, mustard powder and black pepper.  My husband couldn't believe I made this...this is THE mac and cheese recipe you'll ever need!

Very good. I used crumbled crackers on top and that worked out pretty well, but I think it's just fine without putting the cheese or crackers/breadcrumbs on top. Nice as leftovers too

I love this mac and cheese recipe. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because I prefer to sprinkle with grated Parm cheese instead of breadcrumbs, and I like to add Monterey Jack.  It adds a nice *zing* to it.

I made this for an after a funeral gathering and receive tons of compliments.  The only thing I did different was to use garlic salt and onion powder and garlic and butter Ritz crackers.  Getting ready to make it again for Thanksgiving dinner.

Great Mac and Cheese.  I would probably use a little less of the grated cheese next time, almost to cheesy.  I also used more noodles (1/2 cup more boiled) this helped.

Gotta admit, this is a good recipe!  This got cleaned up at our family dinner.  Would like to try with cracker crumbs, instead of bread crumbs, as suggested by another reviewer.  Longest part was making the cream sauce and grating the cheese.  Let it set a bit and the sauce won't be so runny when you serve.

Great recipe!  It was simple to prepare.  My husband doesn't like mac and cheese, but I do and our daughter does.  It was a lot for just the two of us and we ate it as a main dish.  I will be making again and probably cut the recipe in half.

Easy, creamy, and so so yummy!  I'm the only one in the house who likes baked mac and cheese and I ate the entire pan in three days!  I couldn't get enough!  I did everything according to the recipe, just doubled the butter/breadcrumb mixture and added a small sprinkle of granulated garlic and onion powder to the pasta mixture before baking.  I also took the suggestion of other reviewers and used sharp cheese.  It was easy and fantastic!  Those of you who said it was bland are off your rokers!  This recipe is an easy one to vary to your individual tastes!

I added an onion to give it a bit of a kick, and replaced the dry bread crumbs with 1/2 cup crushed ritz crackers.  It was good :)

Instead of the shredded chedder, I used 3/4 c shredded parmessan in the sauce and 1/2 c in the topping. Delicious!

I liked this mac n cheese, but I have had better only because I don't typically like baked macaroni. Nonetheless, I am going to keep this recipe and make it again.

I LOVE this recipe.  My husband asked me why I would possibly want to make macaroni and cheese from scratch when I could just make it from a box.  But as soon as he tasted this, he understood.  SO good, I love it more than the box stuff and most restaurant macaroni and cheese.  I'm not a fan of preseasoned bread crumbs.  So I usually toss plain breadcrumbs with Italian seasonings myself...or use crushed Ritz crackers and seasonings for the top.  Yummilicious.

I have made this a few times now. My variation is using regular mild Kraft cheddar cheese grated and margarine. Sometimes I top with Graham crackers instead of bread crumbs.

Very good.  The only change I will do in the future would be to use margarine instead of butter, the butter seemed to make it alittle rich.  Still a great tasting recipe.  Will make again.  Thank you.

I took this to a potluck and it was a hit!!  Everyone loved it.  Actually, I take that back.  I had one co-worker who said it was "too cheesy" as if there IS such a thing!  :-)   It was the first thing eaten up and it was great.  I would personally prefer it to be more on the baked or firm-side.  It was a little runny, so I think I'll experiement with the liquids to get it more firm.

I had been searching for a decent "comfort food" version of mac and cheese; This one is a hit! The Velveeta makes it very creamy and it even heats up decently in the oven. Thanks!

I tried this using a 4 cheese Mexican blend instead of the cheddar and cheese flavored bread crumbs and got many people asking for the recipe. Fortunately I had it with me and the word has spread! Great, luscious dish.

Pretty darn good!  I doubled the recipe and we've been eating leftovers for the last couple of days.  I cooked it in a big roasting pan for 35 minutes, and left out the breadcrumbs since we were out.

I'll definately make this again, next time I feel like getting closer to a heart attack!!!!

Maccaroni was great.  I added some cheese to the top of it as well.  My little brother loved it.  He complained the whole time I made it that he wanted the KRAFT blue box, but after he ate it he raved about it.

Not as gooey cheesy as some I've made, in a good way!  I liked the semi crunchy topping.  A good mac and cheese, a little more grown up than most that are just fresh cheese versions of the mac and cheese sauce in a box. Drier cheese texture, but not dry.

I doubled the recipe, substituted half-and-half for half of the milk, added a little black pepper, and sauteed onions in the reserved butter, then cooked it in a crock pot. (About two hours on high, two on low.) It worked out great, and everyone loved it.

I love how they call this a "side dish." Egads! Isn't one heart attack enough for one meal? Kidding aside, it was delicious. Very creamy. We added a cup of ham cubes to liven it up a bit.

Great recipe!  To jazz it up a bit we made a bi-dish.  On one side, we had swiss cheese and cut up italian sausage.  On the other side we had cut up chicken and chedder (Velveeta) cheese. Then we sprinkled the shreaded cheese and bread crumbs over the whole dish.  Very good.

Make it even better -- after melting 3 TBL of butter, add a medium sized diced yellow onion and 1/2 tsp - 1 tsp (depending on your taste) ground mustard -- YUM YUM

Turned out perfect.The best macaroni and cheese recipe that I have tried by far. I did add a tsp of chicken soup base and a good pinch of cayenne pepper to the milk before I added the cheese. I gave it just a bit of a kicked up bite. Will make this again and again.

Fairly tasty, but not the best I've ever had. I added more cheese than the recipe called for since I prefer very cheesy mac & cheese.

This is a family favourite! Although I have actually changed it a lot. I added small pieces of red pepper, carrot and small broccolli florets. I skip the velveeta (since u cant buy it in australia) i add in total about a cup of grated low fat cheddar or to taste. I also use nonfat milk to cut down on calories. Its delicious!!!

Wow, this was actually the first time making mac and cheese for a holiday dinner. I was just tired of the same potato dishes. 

 I had doubled this recipe for 6 of us and I had very  little left. Guests were going back 3 times for this dish.  Need I say any more?? 

I did add about 1 tsp dry mustard, 1/2 tsp of onion powder and some Bermuda Sauce that I have on hand to the flour addition.  Since it looked very cheesy I did omit sprinkling the dish with the 1/2 cup of cheese.  

I am actually looking forward to making this again.   

This is a keeper and I want to thank Kraft for the recipe.

WOW...I forgot how wonderful macaroni and cheese can be!!  This was so easy to make and it was a hit with my kids and me.  I used a bit of mozzarella and swiss as well as the processed cheese and the cheddar.  I will certainly be making this again!

I have been making Macaroni and Cheese for years...This recipe was by far THE BEST that my family has ever tasted!  I'm scrapping my old recipe and using this one from now on.  I only made a few changes:  Used whole block of Velveeta , used whole 1 lb box of elbows, used 3 c milk, about 1/2 c flour, and that was about it, everything else was the same as the original.  AWESOME!!

This was ok for me.  My 9 year old son who loves mac and cheese did not enjoy this at all.  It just needed more velveeta and instead of 1 8oz pkg of cheeder cheese it needed to be doubled.  I love cheese.

Per other reviewers' suggestions I added a little bit of cayenne pepper and mustard powder to the cheese sauce before adding the macaroni. I also added some flavor with different cheeses, using a combo of cheddar, parmesan, and monterrey jack in place of just cheddar. Served it with Amy's Garlic Egg chicken (also from this site). Delicious! Boyfriend loved it and we will definitely make again.

So good! I used about 3 tbsp. of Italian Style Breadcrumbs and threw just a dash of onion powder into the cheese mix. Also, I didn't measure the amount of macaroni I used, but it was probably more like 3 cups. I made this in two loaf pans, so I could refrigerate one for leftovers, which is what I'm eating right now!

The flour and butter are the secret to old fashioned southern macaroni and cheese.  Everyone is blown away by this recipe.

I have not tred it with the cheese prodct, I just use extra sharp cheese.  It's also fun to switch out noodles and use penne.

Yum!  Great basic recipe for a cheese sauce, and it makes a good mac and cheese. I've even used the sauce for nachos, spiced up with some paprika, cayenne and onion powder.  It's admittedly a bit bland for my tastes, thus the four stars, but it's easy to perk it up with other cheeses and seasonings.  Sometimes I can't be bothered with the bread crumbs - it's good with or without.

This is a good basic recipe for mac and cheese.  But unless you like you food rather bland, it does need some work.  Like the others, I found the noodle cheese ratio to be out of wack.  So I made extra noodles and ended up almost doubling the recipe.  I used sharp cheddar cheese and added 1/4 teaspoon of mustard powder the same of pepper, ground garlic and onion powder.  I received several compliments and everyone including small children liked the flavor.  Although at first, the children were reluctant to try it, I think the bread crumbs on the top prevented them from recognizing the dish.  Next time I will try broken up potato chips instead.

This is excellent!  
Every time I've tried homemade mac & cheese, the sauce separates and looks like cottage cheese. I added a bit of cayenne pepper, white pepper and dry mustard to the roux.
And it was very good reheated in the microwave.

I have tried many mac and cheese recipes and none of them have turned out the way I liked.  This recipe scores!  Very rich and creamy and sooo good.  My bf told me again the day after how good it was.  I do suggest turning the heat up to boil when tring to get the milk and flour mixture to thicken. then turn it down a little to melt the cheese so you dont burn it. It came out perfect!

I served it for dinner and everyone liked it. I wasn't sure what the consistancy would be like so I didn't melt the cheddar cheese in with the milk mixture.

Really liked this.  Next time I will use the whole package of velveeta.  I used white bread, spread becel margarine on one side and cut up into cubes.  Placed all over top of macaroni (margarine side up).  Baked 20 minutes or until bread is golden brown.  Yummy

mmmmmm, the rich taste of this macaroni & cheese recipe is simply wonderful but i have to wonder what the nutritional values are. i grew up with velvetta cheese & see it is still an ingredient in our 21st century. overall my opinion is to enjoy this creamy delight but beware of the abundant, undisclosed calories. thanks for the recipe, kraft!

This was really good, and I'm not a huge mac & cheese person. I know my hubby will love it! In all honesty, though, it tasted just like the frozen Stouffer's but cost twice as much and took 3 times as long to prepare. Also, only 2 of my 3 kiddos liked it (which is odd!). Four stars, though, because like I said - it is very yummy!!

Awesome!  Creamy and tasty.  My Southern-born husband requested homemade mac and cheese like his Mamma used to make and this hit the spot.  My kids ate seconds and thirds.  No more boxed or frozen for me.

I made this for our holiday meal and it was wonderful.  I doubled the recipe and added extra velveeta.  I also added some onion powder, black pepper and dry mustard to taste to the cheese sauce.  Very creamy.  Yum

Very good!  I doubled the recipe Using a whole box of casserole macaroni (16 oz) and added a little extra velveeta and doubled the bread crumbs as others suggested.  Excellent.  Very creamy and tasty.  I think I would add some pepper and garlic salt next time.

I gave this recipe a 4 for 2 reasons. 1) There was minimal flavor, so I had to add some more salt and parsley and fresh black pepper.  2) The 2 cups pasta was confusing.  Was it 2 cups cooked? It looked too soupy as 2 cups cooked, so I used 4 cups cooked.  It came out just the way I'd hope.  It was really good in the end - but needed a bit tweaking!

Awesome!!!  My 12 year old son, who only eats mac & cheese from a box thought this was great.  He came back for 2nds telling me it was "the best mac & cheese ever!"
Thank-you for a great/easy recipe.

I too was sceptical-not having made mac & cheese at home (love Stouffers frozen).  I was sure to mix well and cook the flour and butter, but it still came out tasting like Flour-not Cheese.  Very dry.  I'll try another recipe next time.

Really good recipe.  I changed only 2 things though; doubled the velveeta (cause we love cheese) and doubled the seasoned breadcrumbs (kept the melted butter the same).  Used mild Cheddar.  Tastes best when it is fresh although it's still good reheated.  Made it for Thanksgiving and it all disappeared.

I was really hesitant about trying to make my own mac & cheese because I've tried other recipes before and was not impressed.  This dish was really good.  My husband thought the cheese was "different" (hence the four stars), but I liked it enough to eat the leftovers.  Thanks for sharing!

absolutely fabulous.  Didn't change a thing about this recipe.  My entire family wanted the recipe.  The kids loved it.  One kid said that this recipe was the best he had ever had.  Heats up really well.  I tripled the recipe and only had a small about left over.  But it warms up in the microwave perfectly.

This was my first time making "real" macaroni and cheese and everyone loved it.  I doubled the recipe and used 1lb of elbow macaroni.  I wasn't sure about that but it worked out.  I can't wait to make this again.

This recipe is INSANELY good. We doubled the Velveeta and only used 1.5 cups of Cheddar Jack cheese instead of regular cheddar and shells instead of macaroni. SO SO SO SO SO SO GOOD.

This was easy, yet very delicious. Here's a quote from my girlfriend when I made it for dinner one night, "This is the best macaroni that I have ever eaten. It's even better than Stofers Mac & Cheese!" If you're looking for one killer mac and cheese, then this is the recipe you're looking for!

This recipe was sooo good.  The best macaroni and cheese I've ever had!!  When you add the cheeses to the milk mixture, the recipe says to stir unitl melted.  This seemed to take a long time for me, so I added the macaroni once the cheese was mostly melted.  The unmelted portion melts while baking.  This might save you a few minutes.

Yum!  I made a double recipe and froze half for another meal.  It was as good frozen and reheated as it was fresh.  I even used leftover penne from a previous meal and it was great.

LOVED IT ! I have made it 2 times and it will be my mac n cheese recipe from now on.  I will try substituting the cheddar with another kind of cheese and see how it turns out.  My hubby like white cheeses the best so I will try and make one somehow.

This turned out OK...I guess it was pretty good. I made this with a chicken fried steak recipe that I also found on this site. My boyfriend came over with unexpected guest- and they all loved it! I heard nothing but good things come from their stuffed faces. I guess the only person who wasn't totally satisfied with the mac and cheese was me. I was wanting something more creamy and with a lot more flavor. I believe that this is a good "starter" recipe and I will just tweek around with it until I find a combination that I like. Thanks

As much as I hate Velveeta I decided to try this because my children hate "real" cheese. I hoped this would make the whole family happy, and it did. I can live with using Velvetta along with "real" cheese. Next time I'll probably add some fresh minced garlic. Definately will become a winter staple in our house!

Super yummy and so easy to make.  I was a little skeptical at first because I am not a big Velveeta fan, but this was outstanding.  I used a little more sharp cheddar than the recipe called for which made it a little too cheezy, next time I think I will substitute the extra cheddar for some of the Velveeta.  I also used garlic salt and cracked pepper instead of plain salt as some other reviewers suggested and both my boyfriend and I agreed it gave a wonderful punch to the dish.

This is one of the best macaroni and cheese recipes I have ever tasted!  I tried it for the first time tonight and it was an instant family favorite!  It has a good creamy texture and is very cheesy.

This was dry and did not taste good.  I was really disappointed after reading all the great reviews.  I may have used too many macaroni noodles; it was not clear whether to cook 2 cups of dry noodles or whether I needed 2 cups once the noodles were cooked (in other words use only about 3/4 cup of dry noodles). I think that may have been my problem. I even added a dash of worsteshire and a drop of tabasco, but we still did not like this at all. Even my toddler who LOVES mac n cheese refused this. Sorry.

My husband even ate this and he isn't a big fan of mac 'n cheese.  This was easy and tasty, maybe a little bit bland, but still good.  I'm glad I found the recipe and I'll make it again.

WOW this was really really good:)  I had tried a few other's before and they do not even begin to compare to this one.  I was scared before it went into the oven becaue it looked really liquidy but it baked perfect and was soo creamy but not too much, just right!!!

Yum, yum, yum, yum!!!!!!  OMG this recipe is absolutely amazing!  It was so cheesy and creamy and just perfect.  I made these last night and my husband could not stop raving about how delicious they were.  He was very impressed.  I invited my friend over for lunch today and we ate the left overs.  She LOVED it.  They were great the next day.

I'll definitely be making this again!

I've made this recipe many times and each time I get rave reviews. I make it as a side item to a dinner party or a summer BBQ as well as the main dish for dinner. Once you get past step #1 (which can be a little tricky... but practice makes perfect), this is a very simple recipe. If you want the dish to be even creamier, omit the Shredded Cheddar Cheese completely and add 1/2 pound Velveeta cheese. It truly is to die for!

I made this for my husband and brother in law who claim they hate Mac n Cheese..well, they ate the ENTIRE dish! I changed it up a little though. I used 1/3lbs of the Velveeta and added 1tsp of dry mustard, black pepper and garlic salt (instead of normal salt). I also added Cajun seaonsing to plain bread crumbs for the topping.

It was very good but i would leave off the buttered crumbs next time. I am gona try a few of the other macoroni and cheese recipes and then decide which is best. This one was very rich and I will look for one using less butter or margarine.

Excellent mac-n-cheese, very creamy and cheesy. Skipped the bread crumb topping and used 2 C of dry macaroni instead of cooked and it still came out great.  It's even great if you don't bake it!

This was very good.  My daughter and I like mac and cheese and hardly have it due to my boyfriend who does not like it.  He liked this one though.  I put a little cayenne pepper and cracked black pepper to give it some spice.  I may even make with jalapenos next time.

Comfort food at its best!!!  Wonderful texture, very creamy, just the right amount of cheese -- my husband and I loved this.  I wasn't in the mood for just mac & cheese, so I added a package of frozen chopped broccoli (cooked it right in the water with the elbox macaroni) and a package of chopped turkey kielbasa.  The result was a very yummy mac & cheese casserole.  My husband wanted to eat the whole pan last night!

Very good recipe, very similar to my mom's.  Try adding cooked bacon before baking and topping it diced tomatoes before serving!  You could also add the tomatoes before baking but i dont like em mushy:)

This Macaroni & Cheese is delicious.  The only changes I made was homemade bread crumbs mixed with fresh grated parmesan cheese.  It practically makes it gourmet!

I absolutely love homemade mac and cheese and not only was this simple, but it tasted wonderful!  I ate the entire dish myself.  My family is not a big fan of homemade mac and cheese - they prefer the boxed stuff - They just don't know what they are missing!!!!

Really great recipe, easy to make to. I actually seasoned the noddles with a lil seasoning salt (that's how my family makes it), but it was really good.

I thought this was ok, but my family didn't really like it.  I did use a blend of mexican cheeses instead of cheddar.  So I will have to try it again with just cheddar.  But it was very easy to make.
