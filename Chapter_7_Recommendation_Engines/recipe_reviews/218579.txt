This is a 5 star recipe when you add a teaspoon of ground ginger and a teaspoon of Chinese chili sauce to the sauce recipe.  It give it just the right amount of kick!

I liked this a lot.  I made some minor adjustments based on what I had, but it still turned out good.  I followed the sauce recipe as written and added 1 tsp. of ginger.  I used 2 packages of fresh cut up broccoli, carrots, and snow peas (stir fry blend) instead of the listed veggies. Also, I only had cooked shrimp, so I added those at the end just until they were hot.  I normally am not this lazy but am in my 1st trimester of pregnancy and could probably fall asleep standing.  ha!  My husband & I enjoyed those cruncy chow mein noodles on top as well.  My 21-month-old daughter gobbled up the shrimp and brown rice (veggies too crisp for her) with a side of peas.  I'll make this again.  I'd make it with chicken, too.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I did add seasoning to my vegetables while cooking them. I did not have cornstarch so I used flour. While cooking down the sauce it thickened quickly so I added about 1/3 of water and turned it on low. I also added about a cup ofcorn I had cooked separately to the dish. I will definitely be making the recipe numerous times more.

I tried to follow the recipe as written, but was missing a few ingredients.  I served this on a bed of white rice, not brown (personal preference).  I didn't have cider vinegar, so I used white wine vinegar.  I had green onions on hand, all chopped and ready to go, so I used them in place of the white onion.  I also didn't have any mushrooms, so I omitted them completely.  I added crushed red pepper for an extra kick, as my husband loves it spicy, a splash of orange juice as I found that the sauce was way too thick, and wanted to thin it out a bit.  At the very end, I threw in some parsley, and it turned out great!!!!  No leftovers in this house!  Thanks for the recipe!  I will be making again!  Yummmmmmmmmm.....

Delish!  Used Stevia instead of honey(2 T) and left out the rice.  So good!

Great recipe.  I added 1 tsp of red pepper flakes and 1-1/2 tsp ginger(fresh grated)  with the garlic and onion saut√©, then 1/2 tsp more to the sauce.  Turned out excellent with just enough heat.  Five stars with the small additions.  :)

Added a teaspoon of ginger and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, as per the other reviews. My only other deviations from the recipe were to leave out the onions, to use 5 1/5 tbsp of soy sauce instead of six (ran out!) and to use regular white vinegar instead of cider vinegar. The result was indeed very tasty. My only caveat was that the sauce thickened up tremendously upon hitting the skillets -- far too much. Maybe I had the heat up too high, but I had to mix in some extra water and next time will probably mix in even more. However, the flavor combinations were terrific, and it makes for a very satisfying meal.

Very yummy as written, but i added some ginger while cooking, and some sesame seeds and cashews at the end for some crunch!  YUM! will definitely be making this again, and maybe try it with chicken instead of shrimp.

I followed the suggestion to add a teaspoon of chili paste and ginger and it was delicious! Very flavorful with just the right amount of heat.

East to make.  Agree that it needs more flavor, so I added the red pepper flakes and made a big difference.  I was wishing it had some pineapple chunks added.  Still needs some tweeking, but basically a good recipe

Loved this recipe and how easy it was to make.  I made my usual white rice (preferred and wouldn't think of microwaving my rice).  Amazingly had all ingredients on hand.  The only thing that would have made it better was more spice.  We like a lot of flavor and some heat.  Next time I'll add the ginger and chili paste as others recommended.  Thank you very much for this wonderful recipe!  We all agreed it's a keeper.

Great recipe! I cooked my rice in fat free chicken broth instead of water for more flavor and used more garlic than the recipe called for. My husband and 2 kids loved it! I cooked the broccoli first and then added to the mix. The broccoli  would have been too crunchy  for children  to eat otherwise.

I used steak in place of the shrimp, because that's what I had on hand. I was out of cider vinegar so I used white vinegar. Turned out good, a little salty, but good.

I made this recipe twice so far. It was too thick and strong the first time I made it. Easily fixed it the second time by adding 1/2  to 2/3 cup water. My son- who is an excellent cook -thought it was just right the second time I made it. This is a keeper for me.

My husband loves this- told me not to loose the recipe. I substitute with veggies I have. Used celery, zucchini, snow peas, peppers and onion first time and sprinkled with cashews on top. Im also a big fan of coconut oil for frying. A great Paleo meal!

This was soooo good!   Followed the recipe as written but added some sugar snaps peas because I had them on hand and love them.   There was plenty of sauce too.  Will definitely make again and again.

Added some sweet chili sauce at the end with some cashews.  Also, only had basmati rice and there were no leftovers.  I agree with others that the sauce cooked up very quickly.  Will watch it next time but so delicious

This was awesome!  The sauce was just right!  I used the listed vegetables, but added celery and cauliflower.  So versatile.

Like many others,  I added a teaspoon of grated ginger and a teaspoon of chili paste.  I also added snow peas and baby corn. I cooked ours in a wok over a gas burner.  I will definitely make this again!

Sauce is delicious. I used white vinegar because I did not have cider vinegar on hand. Agreed it needed something just a bit more to make even more delicious. Will try some ginger next time.  Maybe water chestnuts for crunch. More broccoli and mushrooms and less shrimp and make for 4.

Everyone liked this one. I took some reviewers suggestions and added a teaspoon of ginger to the sauce and a few dashes of red pepper flakes to the shrimp while it was cooking. Because this was a last minute meal I used what I had so I subbed onion powder and left out the mushrooms. Will definitely make this again.

AWESOME! Loved the sauce. Did make a few changes. Added crushed red pepper . Doubled the sauce ingredients but only used 3bls of soy sauce. Added white wine to thin a bit while cooking.  Also, used 1 bag of frozen veggies and added extra fresh broccoli florets.

It was quick and delicious. I didn't have honey so I used brown sugar and we prefer white rice over brown. My kids loved it. Definitely a keeper.

Made with the veggies I had on hand - broccoli,  purple cauliflower, carrot, celery, green onion, and mushrooms.  Veggies need to be cooked on higher heat until tender-crisp. Added a little red pepper flakes to veggies as they were cooking. Made sauce as written here. Served on white rice. It was perfect. Boyfriend said this might have been the best thing I ever cooked for him . Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! The only thing I would do different and this is just a matter of taste, is cut the honey just a little bit but really not much. This really was delicious! Oh I did leave out ginger because I did not have it but followed to the T otherwise.

I added 1 tsp of ginger and 1 tsp of crushed red pepper, and it was a little too spicy for my kids. I'll definitely make it again, though, just with a little less red pepper. I also added 2 T more water to make the sauce a little thinner. It's got a great taste, though!

I have tried a couple of recipes for stir fry and this is the best.  Just the right amount of soy sauce and honey.  I really think the  honey is the key here.  Also my husband won't eat shrimp so I always cook it on the side along with beef and we add these to the plate as we like.  Thanks for sharing

I added cayenne powder and old bay to spice it up and add more of a seafood taste. I used the stir fry blend of veggies like other users. Tasted great. Felt like it was missing a little something. Next time maybe I'll add bell peppers. Yum

Cooked recipe this morning for dinner later this evening. Normally have Chinese on a Friday but wanted to save money. Gave a sample to older sister who said it was very good. 

Here are my adjustments:
omitted mushrooms and carrots, quartered onion instead of chopped,
sauteed onion and garlic together, added little water to sauce once thicken,
COOKED the broccoli the day before for less prep time,
use creole seasoning instead of black pepper,
added duck sauce that gave it the restaurant taste and look.   
 

Next time I will:
add more broccoli or decrease amount of shrimp for better balance,
decrease soy sauce and omit vinegar and will,
try frozen broccoli with chicken breast.

Recommendation: after you combine shrimp and broccoli, place on a low simmer for 5-10 minutes. You want the taste of the sauce throughout your broccoli florets.  Absolutely tasty and restaurant quality!!!

Now, all I have to buy are the egg rolls and combination rice.

i just made this and it was great. My daughter isn't thrilled about vegetables so i used celerly carrots mushrooms onions and garlic and chopped them super tiny and she ate them. I think next time i won't add as much pepper it was a little strong for her but other than that it was a success. ??

Very easy to make and perfect for fixing a quick dinner. my husband loved it too. since we like our food spicy so i added green chillies too while stir frying. and since all the reviews said that the sauce wasn't enough so i just added more water n increased the quantity of other ingredients too, added ginger as well. Shall be making this for the guests this weekend too. and i tried it with garlic rice. Tasted great.

This was so easy and so delicious!!!  The only change I made was that I added 1/2 sliced red pepper and watercress to mine and also sliced chicken.  It was delicious!  When I put the plate of food on the table, my 10 year old daughter said it looked like we were at a chinese restaurant.  I will be making this again soon!

Even though I added ground ginger (fresh would have been better) and red pepper flakes to the sauce, it still needed a little something. If you're sensitive to salt, use reduced-sodium soy sauce. My son thought it was too salty, but everyone else really liked it. I also used a combination of olive oil and a splash of sesame oil to cook the veggies.
