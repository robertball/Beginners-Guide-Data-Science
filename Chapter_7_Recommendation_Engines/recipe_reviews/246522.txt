I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes so I have been trying to find snacking substitutions. I was skeptical at first about swapping my potato chips for crispy and spicy Brussel sprout leaves. It was nice to have all the ingredients in my kitchen. I followed the instructions verbatim. The sprouts came out great. The only reason why I didn’t give it 5 stars is because although tasty, they’re not potato chips.

Yum! I didn't change anything and this came out great. I recommend getting larger brussel sprouts so you get more leaves to work with!

Trying to eat healthier.  Made this with grilled salmon one night. We did not use it as chips, just cut the brussels sprouts in half and roasted per the recipe. They were delicious. Added a little sprinkle of Parmesan cheese to top it off.

Our family loves these and I have made these many times. I get two full cookie sheets of leaves from an 18 oz bag of sprouts. It takes 30 minutes to get the leaves off but its well worth it. There is 1.3 oz of scrap and  16 oz of sprouts left for another recipe. I use less oil but otherwise make one tray of chips as listed and another tray without the peppers but with extra salt for those who don't want the spiciness. For the crushed pepper batch, I use one packet of red peppers from a pizza place. I keep extras just for this. Great recipe.

Wonderful!  I like spicy so added more red peppers.  Also after 15 minutes, I found they didn't crisp so I turned the oven up to 400 and they immediately browned.  Husband said its his new favorite...

So delish! Light and savory and crispy! I had to give them 10 additional minutes to get crispy and golden in my stove and it was worth the wait. Making them twice in the same week!

Quite a bit of work to de-leaf the sprouts, but the end result was tasty and filling. You need to like brussels sprouts to enjoy this recipe.  I like another users suggestion of cutting them and roasting with the marinade.

You know, if my husband says, "This is the best food ever" it's a 5-star review.  Not to mention "These are out of this world!" and "These are even better than potato chips!".   I followed the recipe as written, and experimented with the level of crispness - they were ALL delicious.  This recipe is a keeper.

I made this based upon all the great reviews and I really wanted to like them.  They are a lot of 'work' for very little return on the investment.  While they are crispy and salty and a little spicy (though not spicy enough for our tastes) they have that leftover 'bitter' quality that uncooked sprouts have.  It leaves an aftertaste that isn't great.  For us, these just aren't worth the effort they take to make.  (But clearly, I'm in the minority with this opinion!) :-)

Indeed used large fresh brussel sprouts. 1 lb. of outside leaves only made a small bowl of chips.  PLEASE be careful of time to cook. Mine were burnt at 325 degrees after only 8 minutes.

These are really, really good. They take some time and effort.  But then, even the kids liked them, so it's worth it. Thank you for the recipe.
