This was excellent!  I did modify slightly.  I used chicken breasts cut into bite-sized pieces.  I could not find mochiko (didn't have time to go to an Asian market), but I followed the directions otherwise- except subbed teriyaki for the oyster sauce- and then just before frying, I tossed the pieces with Panko.  The whole family loved it- this will go on my 'make often' list for sure!

This was good.  The directions are a little sketchy on exactly how the whole dredging thing is supposed to happen, but what I did was leave the Rice Flour out of the "marinade" and use that to do the pre-fry dredge.  Not sure if that was the intention, but it made for a nice crispy and light coating on this tasty chicken.  I will definitely make this again.  I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.
