Very simple and easy to make. The hardest part is 
allowing the puff pastry to thaw.  I recommend lining the pan with Silpat sheet (a non-stick sheet that costs about $20 and is well worth the money spent if you do a lot of cookie baking) to keep the sugar from sticking to the pan.  Over all a very delicious treat.

Tried the recipe as stated. way too much cinnamon maybe use only 1/2 as much. A little milk brushed on before spreading the sugar and cinnamon might help it stick together a little better.

These are SO yummy! And WAY easier to make than I thought they would be (I'm a NOT a cook either!) They reminded me of the pasteries we used to get from the bakery when I was little- thank you for this recipie!

Ok so I didn't measure of the sugar or cinnamon, I just rolled out pastry covered with a very small amount of butter and sprinkled sugar and cinnamon all over till well covered, rolled the pastry back up and sliced thinly, I got about 25 cookies out of it and cooked at same temperature for roughly 10-15min, they are lush and my 3yr old loved.

While these are very easy to make, they didn't taste as good as I was expecting.  I brought these to work for a potluck & ended up bringing most of them back home with me.
