I have made this recipe many times now, and it gets rave reviews every time.  I top this cake (because it is a cake!) with a chocolate cream cheese icing.  It's dense and moist and delicious, it gets even better after a day or two (but doesn't always last that long) and it freezes well.

I can't figure out why this recipe is called Chocolate bars, when it really is a cake. The author of the recipe even calls them cookies!
This is a cake, folks. It is good chocolate cake and a good way to use up extra zucchini.For the calorie counters:
I substitued Lighter Bake for the butter, and it cuts the fat yet you lose no moisture or taste. I also cut the sugar some.

This recipe was pretty good. I was a little worried at first because the batter was quite thick and dry, but the cake(it is definately not a bar/cookie) turned out. I put a chocolate frosting on it which was good because the first 4 pieces that we ate were kind of dry, but I think that it was because they were edge pieces. Had another piece from the middle a bit later and that piece was very moist. Oh yeah... I only used 1 1/2 cups of sugar.

I had some zucchini given to me by a gardening friend -- what to do?  My kids hate zucchini!  So I made these, and despite the fact that I didn't manage to whip it up before my son caught me in the act of adding green stuff to the batter ("Mom, what IS that in there?"), they really liked these cake-like brownies.

These bars were great. Super moist. I would say they're more like a very dense cake. I frosted them with a frosting recipe from this site (Chocolate Cookie Buttercream Frosting)Everyone loved them. I will be making them again this weekend.

This is more a cake than a "bar," but it is delicious none the less!  I topped it with Chocolate Cream Cheese Frosting and it did not last a day.  Great recipe.

Try adding 1 tsp. cinnamon and about 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips and make this into muffins - takes a bit longer to bake than a reuglar muffin as it is fairly dense but - remarkably good!!!

Chocolate Zucchini Cake... I added an extra TBLS of cocoa and 2 1/2 cups shredded zucchini. I increased the baking time to 40 minutes and it was wonderful. Perfect balance of chocolate and moistness. Family loved it with the chocolate buttercream frosting.

No, this is definitely not a cookie, or even a bar. It's a cake.  It's a very good cake, but it IS a cake. I didn't frost this, but served it with whipped cream. We enjoyed this for dessert and breakfast!

This was a great and simple recipe.  The whole family loved it.  I made them as muffins and cooked them for about 25-30 minutes.  I substituted applesauce for the vegetable oil.  And I did not  frost these.  It was unnecessary.  There were perfectly sweet and moist.  Being the chocoholic I am, I was worried about not having enough chocolate flavor, but I only had 4 T. of cocoa left, so that's all it got.  The chocolate was not an overwhelming flavor, but it was great for me.

Very good crumb, not very sweet, but with a good frosting just the right amount.  I took it to a church function and it was gone in 10 minutes.  No one knew it had zucchini in it.

I added 2 more tablespoons of chocolate, but DH still complained it wasn't chocolaty enough, so next time will add more. This is not a bar, it's a cake. I found it to be very moist & with the chocolate buttercream frosting on top, very rich. Due to the complaint about the chocolate I have to give it 4 stars instead of 5, but I thought it was very good. A great way to sneak in veggies without anyone knowing!

I agree with the others...this is definitely not a cookie or a bar.  It's like a quickbread or even a cake.  Very moist and yummy, with a subtle chocolate flavor.  Makes me feel not quite so guilty about indulging!

Wow!! It is definitely a cake. A really good, light and airy cake. Tip- After shredding the zucchini  squeeze as much of the water out as possible thru several paper towels or cheese cloth. This is a great way to hide healthy squash. There is no zucchini "taste". Will make again!!

My husband couldn't get over the chocolate/Zucchini mix. He was pleasantly surprised with how great it tasted. Zucchini is one of those foods that takes on the flavor of what you put it in. These bar's were so moist and delicious. One of the yummiest desserts to make with your extra Zucchini. Tired of Zucchini bread.

Loved it!  Did try a healthier version with whole wheat flour, coconut oil for butter and cinnamon applesauce for oil and cut back sugar to one cup.  Yummy! Think will try almond flour next time!

The reason I am giving this four stars instead of five is because it came out a little dry.  I had to keep extending the time because the center took longer to bake, thus making the outside dry.  I will try this recipe again and use a pan larger than 9x13.
