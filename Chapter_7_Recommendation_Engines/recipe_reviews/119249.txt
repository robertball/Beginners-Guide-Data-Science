Recipes like this are fun because there's just so much room for creativity!  I used a homemade broth rather than the canned and included sliced mushrooms and minced garlic with the vegetables, which I sauteed in olive oil rather than butter. Instead of white rice, I used half brown and half wild rice. I skipped the lemon, preferring instead to use additional white wine. For extra richness I used half and half rather than milk.  At the end I added some chopped, roasted red pepper and fresh parsley.  These changes and additions added color, flavor and texture to the soup.  Delicious.

Made 6 (minor) changes to bring it to 5 star. 1)used EVOO instead of butter 2)halved the rice, 3)doubled the carrots, 4)added 2 cups more broth, 5)added 2 TBSP boullion granules (for more flavor & instead of salt), 6)cooked the rice right in the broth (ONLY for the time stated for the rice). DH and I LOVED it. Thank you Marge Wagner for a delicious way to use up leftover chicken!

This came out really good, but I did a few things differently based on a friend's advise.  We cooked the onions and then added raw chicken on the bone and some water and boiled it until done, then deboned and chopped the chicken.  This made our stock.  Then we added the rice, and made the roux when the rice was done.  The white wine and lemon juice really gave this soup great flavor.  A+ recipe, great proportions, just really good soup.  Thanks

This soup was delicious! It was warm and creamy but not too heavy! The only changes I made were adding more chicken broth and a little bit more of the vegetables. I would def make them again!

This soup does taste really good. My only problem was that the soup was really thick and needed more liquid than stated. I added frozen peas & carrots to the pot along with the onions and celery. Also, I had leftover bone in chicken breasts which I shredded and added to the soup in the end to heat through. I skipped out on the lemon juice as hubby doesn't like it. I will definitely make this again as it is a great way to use up leftover chicken and frozen vegetables. Could also try this by substituting the rice with pasta.

I used a whole large onion, added in more chopped celery and carrot and fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. I did not need the flour because I cut back on the milk to a scant 1/4 cup and I used fat free evaporated milk (you get the creamy texture but you're using less and there's no need for the flour to thicken). I also used wild rice because I had that on hand. NOTE: For people who have small budgets and low patience, the chicken can be cooked in the crockpot. I use ingredients that I would normally make stock (garlic, onion, celery carrot) and enough water to cover and throw that in the crockpot on high for four hours or so. Once that's ready, all you have to do is saute your vegetables and cook your rice and add them to the crockpot, adding the milk/lemon juice/wine at the last. Seems like the long way around when you think about it, but you save both on food and energy costs.

This is good.  I added 2 tbsp dry sherry (NOT cooking sherry) instead of the wine.  Really adds great flavor.

A nice, easy chicken rice soup that was comforting to the belly without adding extra fat. We left out the celery and wine and increased the amount of rice, carrots and chicken to make it even heartier.

3 I used much more milk than what it calls for.

Try this! It's cozy comfort food! I did change it up just a bit: increased carrots from 1/2 to 3/4 cup, added 1 cup of water and 1 chicken boullion cube (once the soup was boiling) since reviewers  mentioned it was very thick,  increased chicken to 2 cups, decreased salt to 1/4 tsp, and added 1/8 tsp thyme. Would've given it 5.5 stars with my changes. I was very leary of the lemon juice, thinking, "There's no way this is gonna taste good." But surprise-surprise! It really added a "brightness" to the flavor. Don't be afraid of it --- just add 1 tsp at a time like I did. I do think that 2 tbsp with the addition of the 1 cup of water was perfect. I'd use 1.5 tbsp in the original recipe. Thanks, Marge, for an awesome winter evening meal! Our tummies were full and happy. :)

I would skip the flour next time, this became so thick that I had to double the amount of chicken broth. It was a little bland, needs more garlic and lemon juice. To make this healthier I doubled the amount of vegetables and I used brown rice, fat free broth, fat free milk, and margarine.

This was delicious! I doubled the recipe, added morel mushrooms and fresh, pressed garlic to the carrots, celery and onion mixture, and sauteed them all in a combo of 2 Tbsp EVOO and 2 Tbsp butter. I added 1/4 up of white wine after the flour was mixed into the veggies, right before I poured the broth into the pot. I finished it off with 3 cups of cooked rice (remember I doubled the recipe) and 1 1/2 cups 2% milk and 1/2 cup of heavy cream. I omitted the lemon juice altogether. Very kiddo friendly:) Yummmm!

This recipe is great and very versatile.  I omitted the celery and onion, reduced the lemon juice to 2 tsp, and substituted 1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar and 2 tsp apple juice for the wine- and it still was wonderful.  This one is a keeper for me- thanks for sharing!

Oh I really liked this recipe!  The only changes I made ...
I boiled my chicken for 1 1/2 hours and used the homemade broth
and
I added pre-cooked rice as opposed to cooking the rice in the soup!  
Other than those two things I kept everything the same!

This was so yummy!  I used brown rice and added some herbs.  It came out a bit thick so next time I think I'll use a little less rice and more liquid.

I made this soup tonight and it was wonderful. The lemon juice and wine are a wonderful addition. I made it exactly as printed except I used 1% milk because that's what I have and left out the pepper because I don't like it. Highly recommend this yummy soup.
2018:Ten years later I am adding this note: I've made this many times and it is still soooo good. One of my favorite soups

I especially liked it because it wasn't too heavy.  I made one substitution, trimmped, chopped broccoli stems for celery based on what I had on hand.  I also left out the lemon juice and the white wine. yummy!--I've made this several times now, and I've added back in the lemon juice (but not the wine).  The lemon juice adds a nice little kick.  I've also used cream or half and half based on what I had on hand. Obviously that makes for richer food, but still yummy.

This is a wonderful recipe.  This recipe deserves to be rated, so here it goes.  I made this soup, flovors tasted most layered when eaten freshly prepared.  I substituted brown rice in place of the long grain rice.  It anything it added to the creaminess.  Such a great comfort food.  Easy to prepare.

Good soup and easy to make.  I changed a thing or two only because of the ingredients I had on hand.  I used celery seed (was out of celery), used whole milk (it's what I had), and used lime juice instead of lemon.  I did add fresh minced parsley for a little bit of color, it was great.  I loved the consistency, thought it was perfect, not too thick and not too runny.  I did add a bit more than 1/8 tsp of garlic, I added more like 1/2 tsp. because I thought it was too bland without.

This is a very nice recipe and a great way to use up left over chicken. Instead of canned broth I use 3C. of "phony" broth (1t. of Jamison's paste per 1C. water) and 1 can of Cream of Chicken soup. We are soup connosieurs and this one definitely makes the grade!

I thought this soup was okay though nothing special.  I had to add several extra cups of water because it would have been much too thick otherwsie.  I threw in a handful of broccoli and corn to add some color.  I won't be making this again.

Great soup.  Couple of changes...I added 2 cups of diced chicken that needed to be used and wild rice because that was what I had on had.  I really appreciate the changes made to give this recipe a healthier twist without losing flavor.  I will make again and again as in addition to healthy the ingredients are pretty much staples in my house.  Thanks for sharing!

so delicious. I used my own chicken stock and added a pinch of dill for a different flavour but other than that i left the recipe alone and it was awesome.

Awesome soup!  I, too, used half and half.  I omitted the lemon juice and wine because I barely got the cream into it before my husband was already eating some.  He didn't want me to change it after his first bite.

This was pretty good!  I agree with others that this really isn't "soup" per se, more of a chicken and rice dish. I cheated and used last night's leftover turkey and cooked the rice right along with everything else. Very filling and the lemon flavoring just gave it a nice fresh taste.  Very well received by the kids!

Great, and quick soup... The only thing different I did was use white rice((didnt have long grain) and I used a fresh clove of garlic instead of powder. I also had homemade chicken stock, instead of store bought. I thought this was very yummy.. the lemon and wine kicked it up a notch after adding it. Will definetely make again!!!

I like this and like that it is a little lower in calories and fat. I was going to try to crock pot it, but changed my mind. I did let this simmer for a couple hours prior to adding the milk. It was very thick so I would suggest either adding some extra chicken broth or water to the base or using half the amount of flour. I prefer a thicker soup. I used plenty of carrots and used wild rice in place of regular rice. I will be making this again and again!

I decided I didn't like the milk at all. I had roasted a chicken the night before for use during the week and made my own stock according to the article on this website. This recipe was lacking something, it seemed-next time I'll try adding a bouillon cube, cutting out the milk and wine, and hopefully I'll have a slightly more basic soup.

EDIT: The day I made it, this soup was so-so, but for days afterward I've heated it in the microwave and it is delish! Definitely better the second day. :)

This is the most amazing soup I have ever made!!! I'd give it 10 stars if I could. I have to admit, though, I did make it a lot more unhealthy. I used cubed chicken thighs instead of breast, I used the full sodium chicken broth (but did not add more salt), and I used a mixture of milk and cream. But this is SO good! I also used shallots instead of onion, and I added peas. I will probably make this once a week, it's so good. I call it "Clean Out the Kitchen Soup" because I had to make it the day before grocery shopping (and my cupboard was looking pretty bare!). Thank you thank you for this recipe!

Way too thick. I needed to use about 4x the amount of chicken broth to even make it remotely soupy, and I imagine any leftover will need more liquid to add to it. Other than that, which is a biggie for me, the soup tasted good.

I made this with tiny pasta shells instead of rice.  It was delicious.  Not to thick as I often find creamy soups to be.  Great with crushed crackers - perfect for a chilly day.

I just made this soup with leftover Thanksgiving turkey, and oh my goodness!  It's wonderful.  I only made a few modifications, other than the turkey, based on what I had at home.  I chopped three carrots, and had to use dried minced onion since I had just used my last one.  I added garlic to the saute step, and used skim milk.   This is a great recipe and I'm sure it will be featured at my house again!

This is a fabulous soup! I did make some changes, after reading some viewer comments. I simmered my chicken in broth with the veggies, and made the roux sepatarely, then added it to the mix, the lemon juice is key! My daughters loved it. I also made 1 1/2 times the recipe, and it made enough for dinner, some to freeze, and plenty for my girls to take to school in their thermos!

I made this soup the first time following the recipe exactly and it was wonderful. Since then I've added some chopped cilantro which goes well with the lemon and serve it with some lemon wedges for those who want a little more of the lemon flavor. This soup gets rave reviews from family and friends every time!

This was a really great soup, and I love how healthy it is, too!  My whole family loved it and ate it all up.  I only had fat-free milk on hand, and it still turned out very creamy and flavorful.  I also didn't have lemon or white wine, so I didn't use those, but I think the lemon would be nice.  I do agree that there was maybe a little too much rice, but it didn't ruin it or anything.  Overall, a solid recipe.

Husband loved this recipe the first time I made it but I need someone to clarify something in the recipe.  When it calls for 2 cans of chicken broth, does this refer to the "condensed" chicken broth that is sold in the can by Campbell's Soup??  Or is there a ready-to-use broth sold in cans by Campbell's soup?  I don't remember what I did last time (unfortunately) and I would love to duplicate the delicious recipe I made the first time!

It was a pretty good dish, however I wouldn't call it a soup. What I ended up with was a lot of cooked rice with chicken and veggies in it. You'd have to add a lot more liquid for it to stay in a soup consistency.

Mine turned our extremely thick, but it was delicious.  Next time, I think that I will use one cup of wild rice and not let it simmer as long (I used brown rice and it simmered close to an hour).

The kids really love this recipe, and its quick and easy.  I always have to double it and we never have leftovers.  The only changes I made was left the onions out (picky eaters), sauteed some minced garlic with the celery and onions and let the chicken cook with the vegetables in the broth.  I also add some onion powder in it to get the taste of onions.  I also add some cheese to it at the end...love cheese in everything.  This recipe has become one of the favs around here.

This was delicious! The lemon juice and white wine really make the flavor. I used lemon juice from concentrate and it worked great. I only make soup in huge amounts for leftovers, so I left the rice out of the soup and poured the soup over rice. I also doubled the recipe and used 1/2 of the chicken called for. We like chicken shredded rather than cubed. It worked great and this is a definite keeper! I can only give 4 stars since I did adjust the recipe.

Absolutely delicious.  I've never had a soup complimented so much before.  I didn't add wine or lemon juice, and I did add a touch more chicken broth, but really just wonderful!

My family really loved this soup.  I doubled the servings to 12 and still have only a small bowl of leftovers.  I did add extra broth and I didn't have any wine.  The next time I make this, I will add more veggies.  My kids really liked the taste of it and I think I could sneak some more in.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This was the best chicken and rice soup!!  It is now one of my favorite soups and it is soooo easy to make!  I did omit the wine.

Made this today but I made a few adjustments.  I added a teaspoon of combined oregano, basil, rosemary, and thyme.  I also added about cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  In my opinion, it gave the soup a better flavor and what isn't better with cheese!!  I think another reviewer mentioned that it didn't make for very good leftovers and I agree.  The rice soaked up all the moisture and I was left with a kind of pasty rice.  All in all a delicious soup that I will make for years to come.  :)

My husband said that this is the best soup he has ever had.  He said it could be served at a five star restaurant.  It is very good, and easy to.  The only changes I made were to make my own broth, use brown rice and for the milk I used half milk and half 1/2 and 1/2.  The only reason I made that change was because I had half a container of 1/2 and 1/2 left over from a Christmas recipe, and I was low on milk.  Next time I'll just use 2% milk.

I just made this for my dad who has high blood pressure and he loved it. I was looking for something with low sodium. I didn't add the salt and even used unsalted butter. The rest of the family loved it too. I did use brown rice and halved the lemon juice and added peas. Yummy!!

Very nummy!  The only changes I made were I used leftover turkey and left out the lemon juice and wine.  Very delicious.  My husband even liked it and he rarely compliments my cooking!

Yum!  I didn't have celery, but I had a bunch of frozen veggies -- I used 1 1/2 cups each of frozen carrots, frozen corn and frozen green beans.  I thawed the veggies and then added them to the onion sauteed in butter after approximately 3-4 minutes.  I used much more garlic powder per our tastes.  And I didn't have white wine -- so just used lemon juice.  Delicious!!!

This is really, really good!  I used brown rice to give more nutrition and texture.  Great comfort food.
