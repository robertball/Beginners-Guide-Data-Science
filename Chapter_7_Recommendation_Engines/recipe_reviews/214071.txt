I never liked artichokes before eating this dish but it is outstanding! It tastes like it is from a very fancy restaurant. The one and only creator of this dish, Francesca herself, has made it for me 3 times. She is from Lockport, IL. She created this dish and won 1st place in a local competition with this recipe. She is glad that people are enjoying her recipe.

***
Hi this is Francesca.  I am glad you liked the recipe.  Here are some hints:  I usually serve it with angel hair pasta and steamed brocolli coated in olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper.  To make it less fattening, you could substitute olive oil for half of the amount of butter in the Shrimp recipe.   It does not change the flavor.  You could also add, some cherry tomato cut in half to add more color.  You could serve it with some tabasco sauce.  Also serve with a glass of medium bodied wine to enhance the flavor of the dish.  I would just like to add, that I have always wanted this to become a dish that is served at weddings, for engagement parties as well as the birth of children.  In any event, it is a celebratory dish.  God Bless All, and thank you for posting my recipe.

This is a keeper.  Family of 4 loved it.  I  used 2 Tbs lemon juice and used parmesan cheese instead of romano and I used over a pound of regualr-sized shrimp.  Everyone had seconds and I wish there was a little more so I'll use 1 1/2 pounds of shrimp next time.  We served with buttered vermicelli pasta.  We also sprinkled more parmesan over our dish.  I followed one suggestion to use half butter half olive oil.  My 2 daughters said it's better than the pasta dishes they tried at the Cheesecake Factory restaurant. Delicious, give it a try.

This was to die for!!!  Usually, I am a little skeptical of a recipe with not a lot of reviews...soooo glad I took the risk b/c it was WELL worth it!  I followed the recipe exactly as listed.

I use alot of recipes from this site but usually dont take the time to review them. This dish was fantastic and super quick and easy yet tasted elegant like from a four start restaurant, I whipped this together in literally minutes.  My 14 year old said it was the best thing she's ever eaten, and my nine yeal old who only eats chicken fingers said it looked good, "even to her!!". I served it along side yellow rice.  The only thing I might do next time is add an 1/8 of a cup of dry white wine to make a little bit of a sauce but that's a prefernce., the recipe was outstanding as is., thanks for sharing!!

This was really good.  I cut back on the butter this time, but next time I will do exactly what the recipe says.  I might also crisp it up a little under the broiler at the end.

This was an excellent recipe!  I served it as an appetizer on crostini and it was devoured! I seasoned the shrimp with creole and red pepper seasoning. I also used more garlic than the recipe called for and sauteed it slowly for about 10 minutes in the butter and added a 1/4 cup white wine to that mixture before pouring over the shrimp.  This allowed the flavors to enhance and in addition gave more sauce while it baked. I had some left over jalepeno havarti that I included with the romano and it was delicious. I would use a little more soft cheese such as the havarti next time.  I can't wait to make this again!

This was great! I followed it exactly except that I didn't have romano cheese, so I used shredded parmesan. Most recipes that taste this good require a lot more prep time. Thanks!

Very lemony and we liked it; cut back on the lemon if you are not a huge lemon fan.  I mixed panko bread crumbs with italian seasoning for the seasoned bread crumbs.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I divided the butter and garlic and put 3/4 of it in with the shrimp.  I then melted the remainder of the butter and garlic and added a dollop of white wine and sauteed in a pan, then added the cooked pasta to the pan to absorb the flavors.  I will definitely make this again!

This is excellent, and SUPER easy.  My husband took them to work the next day (yes--he's one of THOSE PEOPLE who microwaves seafood, lol) and said they're even better the next day.  It's not low fat, obviously, but well worth the extra calories!  EDIT:  I've made this twice now, and the second time, I didn't have any bread crumbs.  When it was finished, I tossed the shrimp with 1/2 lb. of cooked pasta and I think it was even better that way.

I've made this a couple of times.  Second time I added fresh spinach and 1/4 cup white wine and liked it much better with those additions. The white wine gives it more of a sauce when you serve it with pasta or rice. Very yummy and quick to the table!

Delish! The store only had 13 ounce cans of artichokes, but I love them, so that was not a problem. I also used half a lemon, and also half butter/ half olive oil. I served it over angel hair pasta, which I did not butter, thinking the sauce would be enough (and it was).  I will definitely be making this again! Thank you for such a great and easy recipe.

I made this on the spur-of-the-moment after I bought shrimp. I wanted something with garlic and lemon and the idea of artichokes was intriguing. I didn't add quite as much butter or bread crumbs as suggested, and added some capers at the end; otherwise I didn't change a thing. The richness of the butter and breadcrumbs worked perfectly with the bite of the artichoke and capers. This was quick, easy and yummy and my daughter and I loved it. We served it over brown rice and will definitely be making it again.

This was quite good.  It was a little rich but good.  Changes I made:  I used Italian seasoned Panko crumbs (to which I added about 1/2 T additional Italian seasoning) which made it crunchier.  I melted the butter and then added the garlic and lemon juice to it rather than sprinkle the lemon juice on the crumbs.  I thought it would mix in better this way. I also had no Romano cheese on hand so I used parm.

Although this was to die for, just a FYI.  I read so many reviews about people using olive oil instead of butter and claim it has less calories.  In fact, olive oil has more calories but less saturated fat than butter.  Enjoy this recipe regardless of your choice of fat!!

This recipe has the right idea, but fell short bc it was too dry. I agree with a few folks that said to add more butter/liquid/sauce. I served it over noodles and it just needed more sauce. I'm going to tweak this and try it again!  More sauce would make this FAB-U-lous!

Excellent recipe. Gave it 4 stars cause I added quartered mushrooms with the artichokes. Sprinkled red onion and red bell pepper over top with cheese. Very Good!!

.So awesome.  Very elegant dish. Follow the recipe and you can't lose. Very easy to prepare.  Hardest part is getting shrimp ready.

We enjoyed this recipe.  I did as others did and made with butter and olive oil.  Served it over angel hair pasta (added olive oil/garlic/butter to pasta).  Will definately be a recipe that I keep.  Thank you!

Excellent!  I cut back on the butter and added in some EVOO.  I increased the garlic and baked for about 15 minutes.  I served this over lightly seasoned garlic olive oil with a side of italian roasted asparagus.  Was perfect!

This lacked flavor for us. We all agreed that something is missing from this. It is a very good base recipe though.  Will cut back on the lemon juice next time for sure.

My shrimp were from the Gulf area so I omitted the butter. I found them still a bit oily but everyone gobbled them up.

Yep, it was OK. Very quick and easy to throw together for a weeknight meal. The flavors all worked together, it was just unexciting and needed a little oomph. If I were to make it again, I'd just stick this under the broiler for a few minutes to cook the shrimp and ensure the breadcrumbs got crispy (they didn't) and the cheese was melted and broed (it didn't...and I used extra).

The shrimp was cooked perfectly, and had a good flavor, reminding me of Shrimp Scampi.  I followed the recipe exactly, but the bread crumbs turned to mush.  Love artichokes, and they tasted good, but overall the dish was a big question for me.  Can't figure out how to serve it as an appetizer, mine didn't look nearly as pretty as the picture, and there is not enough sauce for pasta or rice.  I think this is a great idea that needs some refining.

Certainly edible but there's better shrimp recipes out there. All I could taste were the artichokes.  I really wanted to like this because it's easy and looks nice after broiling it for a couple minutes.

I made this for dinner and it was amazing! The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the butter sauce was delicious. The only change I made was to add marinated artichoke hearts instead of packed in water. I will make this for company anytime! Thanks.

Delicious!  The only thing I'd say was that it took longer than 12 mins to cook the dish.  I'd say maybe 20 ...

Delicious, but my family felt there were too many breadcrumbs.  Might switch to italian Panko - the bread crumbs I used were too fine.  Taste, however, was DELISH.  Thanks Francesca for posting!

This was delicious! I added 2 ingredients: 1 bag of baby spinach and 1/2 pint of cherry tomatoes. I sauteed both of those ingredients in a little olive oil and garlic salt. I also only used about 2 tablespoons of bread crumbs because I wanted there to be more of a sauce over the pasta and I was concerned that the crumbs would soak up the butter sauce.

It was described as fine dining food and was anything but.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was bland, very bland.  The shrimp tasted like plain shrimp on top of bread crumbs.  Would not recommend to anyone.

Fantastic - wouldn't change a thing.  I used butter to "grease" the pan and had very large shrimp (12 - 15 per pound) so baked it just a bit longer.  Thank you for a fantastic meal!

Pretty good.  I made it just like the directions and it tasted good but was soggy.  I was hoping for shrimp with a crunchy topping but the breading was kind of gross.  I didn't care about the sauce as we did not eat it over anything. Next time I will pour the butter over the shrimp, then add bread crumbs and cheese and then just enough butter to crisp the crumbs.  Might also add panko.

This was really good, made it for a crowd for the first time and a couple of people hovered over the dish until finished. The only change I made, out of not having any on hand, was I subbed the Romano for shredded Parmesan and thought it was really good. Loved the ease of prep and carry. Will definetely make this again. Good enough for Christmas Eve appie night.

Loved the combo of shrimp and artichokes, and how easy this was to put together. I used half the butter and more cheese, and plain bread crumbs seasoned with fresh basil and dried oregano. After ten minutes, I broiled this for about three minutes to brown it, and it came out perfect.

This can be made lower fat.  Just simply make your own bread crumbs maybe using potato bread or lower calorie breads (easy enough in oven with italian seasoning spice), sub your butter with lite, use cheese that is lower in fat.   I cook for a household with conditions that call for me to alter ingredients and you will be surprised how much (as your experiment) can be done and never miss the flavor.

One of the first recipes I found here in 2010. Still my favorite on this site. I wouldn't change a thing. I wouldn't ruin it with a bunch of different veggies. Have them on the side!!!

Loved the flavors and how easy it was to prepare; however, there was no sauce or enough liquid in the dish to add to the angel hair pasta, which makes the dish very dry.  It definitely needs a side sauce of some kind to add onto the pasta.  Next time I will make a white wine, butter, lemon and garlic sauce to add.

This is an amazing recipe.  I made it for 16 people on Mother's Day and everyone loved it- even the kids! The only thing I did differently was to use  1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil- as some of the other reviewers suggested.  I served it over angel hair pasta with steamed broccolini on the side. This is definitely a keeper!

This was awesome.I normally do not eat artichoke but I ate it. I was surprised that my son didn't eat the artichoke, but he knew it was a veg and it automatically turned him off.

Just tried this for dinner---it is 5 star dinner--will make it again.
I followed the recipe and was worried that it wouldn't have enough"sauce" to put over noodles--but it did....great flavors

This was good but for me, not as amazing as the other reviewers made it out to be. I guess there's some ease in assembling it in a baking dish, but I think I would rather saute all the ingredients. I did not use as much butter as it called for and I'm sure that affected it but I just don't think we need to have a whole stick of butter in one dinner! The bread crumbs didn't seem to add anything at all. Loved the artichokes and my family liked it but I think there are better ways to put this dish together.

This was delicious.  I made some additions.  I added mushrooms.  Used 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c olive oil.  Mixed in garlic, pesto, basil, crushed red pepper, pepper, and sea salt.  I topped the dish off with romano cheese and a blend of mozzarella and provolone cheese.  Served over angel hair pasta with garlic bread.  Very good!  The pesto added a lot of flavor.

I made this using marinated artichokes, well drained, and panko seasoned with a tuscan seasoning.  I served this over pasta using the butter/lemon sauce to drizzle over when serving.  Mine had to bake a little longer because I had assembled them ahead of time and refrigerated them.  Good, but I thought this lacked pizzazz.

soooo easy yet so yummy!  I used just a squirt of lemon juice, 1/8 cup olive oil, 1/8 cup canola oil (instead of 1/2 cup butter-reduced fat to 1/4 cup total), and parm cheese.  Served over spaghetti tossed with 1 Tbls butter, 1 Tbls olive oil, and some garlic).

Amazing! Just finished baking and eating this incredible dish. I don't have any suggestions or changes to add. It was simple, quick and a huge hit with my family. I served it with buttered noodles, garlic bread and an easy spinach salad. It was better than going out to eat! A must try!

Very good and easy.  I added some broccali and really enjoyed it.  Served with angel hair pasta.  Next time I may try adding extra lemon juice or even a few shakes of red pepper.  I did use marinated artichokes, as that was all I had.  Would definitely recommend this recipe!

Everyone enjoyed this!  Next time I will double the recipe. I served this over rice.  Would be OK without the artichoke hearts but they were really tasty infused with the  garlic and butter.  I did bake this a little longer than recommended.

This was great! I doubled the batch and served it over rice pilaf. I cooked it in a tinfoil pan (same size as directions) which worked out perfect! I will be making this recipe again for sure! What a hit : ) Thanks.

One of the tastiest and simplest recipes I've found!

1. I served it over spaghetti.
2. Instead of italian seasoned bread crumbs, I used panko bread crumbs, which made it light and fluffy
3. I used shaved parmesan instead of Romano cheese.

I think all these changes are minor - the key ingredients were definitely the shrimp, artichoke, garlic and lemon juice.

I'd make this again, in a heart beat! Thanks for a great recipe!

Not great, not bad.  I served it over brown rice and there was enough "sauce" to keep it moist.  It just wasn't one of my favorites.

This is amazing. I did as the recipe states with the exception of cheese and it was amazing. (I too only had fresh grated parm and I have no idea what a TBS would look like over a 9x13 pan, so I sprinkled 1/4 cup.) The lemon really did add a lot, my husband thought the artichokes were pickled at first becasue the lemon gives a little zing.  My husband said "I would pay for that." and then looked at how much was left and said, I don't think that is going to be good reheated (thinking he could get seconds) but I informed him another review advised it was was as good if not better the next day. So we wait.

Not bad, but bland.  I had to add extra garlic and lemon and still feel it could use more flavor.  Way too much butter.

Great recipe! I followed the recipe exactly except for using 1.5 lbs of shrimp. I didn't have a 13x9 pan so I used 2 12x6's. I seperated the ingrediants between the 2 dishes so all the shrimp could be covered. LOVED the lemon. I used half a lemon to each dish. Overall, turned out great. I think the lemon made everything really flavorful! Served over white rice! WIll make again!

Yes, I agree that this is an outstanding shrimp dish.  We love the flavor of lemon.  Easy to fix.  I did use marinated artichokes and panko crumbs. Will make again and again - was like going out to a great restaurant.

This is an outstanding and crazy-easy recipe. My kids all thought it was delicious and said, "Mom, make this every week!" Highly recommend. Didn't have Romano but Parm worked just fine. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written. Also good with white wine in place of the lemon juice if you don't have any on hand.

WONDERFUL!!!  I used panko breadcrumbs and added capers to the shrimp and artichokes.  I also cut back a little on the butter.  But otherwise, all other ingredients remained the same.  Served this with a lemony-dressed spinach salad.  It was the perfect weeknight dinner.  Thanks for sharing such a delicious recipe, Milonek!

After reading the current (June, 2010) "Most Helpful" review by Jeaux Bee, including comments by Francesca herself, I followed the recipe exactly, but added cherry tomatoes as a suggested option and served over angel hair pasta.  Many of the less favorable reviews found the dish to be "bland."  I would describe it as "light" and think that was the intention with this dish.  For my taste, I do agree that it needs a little something.  I will definately make this again, and keep the cherry tomatoes, but will try sauteing the garlic (and call me crazy, but I would use even more) in 1/4 cup white wine or dry sherry and use half the amount of butter.  I would also add salt and pepper to taste.  And it really made a beautiful presentation!  Thank you Francesca!

Really a keeper, I also browned the dish under the broiler for a few minutes, I did half with artichoke hearts and half with broccoli florets, for those who don't like artichoke, placed whole cherry tomatoes throughout the dish for some color, also used a 3-cheese combination, parmesan, romano, asiago on top, served over angel hair pasta.  Will definitely make this again...my husband thought it was very good...

This was pretty good.  I followed other suggestions by replacing the butter with 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup olive oil.  Also added white wine to make a little sauce.

So easy it seems too good to be true - but it is!  I did add some white wine to make more of a sauce; delicious with bread or over noodles.

This was very good.  The only change I'd make next time is to reduce the butter slightly, I thought it was just a bit too greasy for my taste.  But aside from that, the flavor combination is terrific.

Just made this and my hubby said it was the BEST shrimp dish I have ever made!  I actually followed the recipe for the most part and it was perfect.  Not too garlicky, not too lemony just right.  I served it over rice.  I did put in extra lemon juice and an extra 1/2 stick of butter because I wanted to make sure there was enough sauce to go over the rice and there was.  You do have to like artichoke hearts though. The Romano cheese thicken it up a little bit and added a nice texture. I would definitely make this for company.

This recipe was fantastic!! I have used several recipes from this site and never felt compelled to write a review until I tried this. I didn't make any changes or substitutions and thought it was perfect as is. I agree with another review on this, it really does taste like something you would get in a restaurant. I will definitely be making it again!

I thought this was OK but certainly not great.  Yes, it is very easy to put together, but the dish's presentation leaves a lot to be desired.  I think the thing that I disliked most about it was that overall, it was dry (I used large shrimp and didn't overcook it).  I think what it needs to overcome the dryness and help with some eye appeal is a sauce, maybe a butter lemon sauce.  I'm going to give this one more try with a sauce, but as written, it just didn't work for us.  Sorry.

I used about 2.5 tablespoons of butter to saute the garlic and artichoke hearts.  When it smells good, I put in the lemon rind and shrimp.  Then I added parsley and juice from 1/2 of the lemon.  Served with the cheese.  I skipped the bread crumb.

This was quite yummy!!  I found that Italian Panko breadcrumbs will give you a little bit more crunch.  I also added tomatoes and capers for some color.  Also added some white wine.

Perfection!  Had to use parmesan cheese - and went a little heavy on the cheese too.  Also used the whole can of artichokes because I love them. I broiled this for the last 3 minutes or so. It was fabulous!  Will definitely make this again.

Everyone enjoyed. I added 5 mushrooms ( quartered) and 1/4 C white wine which helped moisten the bread crumbs. Served over butter noodles. Oh, and I cut butter in half and added olive oil as others suggested.

I have made many recipes from this website and  had high hopes for an outstanding meal after reading a lot of the reviews on this one. I thought this was just ok. It was bland and soggy. I even broiled it for a couple of minutes to try to crisp up the bread crumbs. I have had made many other fantastic shrimp dishes and will not make this again.

This was super quick and easy. I prepared it just as the recipe stated. My husband loved it, the only complaint he had was that he wished the breadcrumbs were a little bit crispier. So next time I'll put under the broiler or maybe use half panko bread crumbs. Will definitely be making this again.

Thank you Francesca for posting this recipe!  I agree with previous user - never thought twice about artichoke hearts but I love it now.  This recipe is outstanding.  I've made it several times - it's super easy and every always loves it.  Like the tip on subbing olive oil for butter...I've tried that and it really doesn't change the flavor too much...or use Olivio - olive oil butter - makes it a little healthier!  Best part - yummy shrimp that doesn't stink up the house because they're baked!

It's the first time (which is a very long time of cooking) I ever used artichokes (which my husband loves) in a recipe  and it will certainly be a go-to recipe.  I made it as an main dish, but it would be a great appetizer in shell dishes with 3-4 shrimp and the same amount of artichokes ( inside each shrimp). The only change I made to the recipe was using Parmesan cheese instead of Romano (it was the only thing I had).

Easy and delicious just the way the instructions said.  2 thumbs up from two of us, 1 from the other two (but only because they LOVE shrimp scampi more or think they dislike artichokes).  More importantly, the family member who is most indifferent to her food thought this one was a keeper!

Excellent. Used half olive oil and half butter. Baked for 10 mins, then broiled on high for 2 mins. Served over angel hair. Perfect!

Excellent!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  The only thing I would change is to add a bit more sauce to help coat the pasta.  I used half butter and half EVOO.  Delicious!

This was good.  I used the frozen shrimp you can buy in the bag a the grocery store, it only contained 14 ounces and I did not have fresh parsley so I used dried and substituted parmesan cheese for the romano.  It was easy and tasted great but it took a bit more than 12 minutes to cook.

OMG - this dish is absolutely awesome. I can't wait to make this again! I used both the Italian bread crumbs and panko bread crumbs and just half the lemon.  We ate this over jasmine rice. I think next time I will try it with angel hair pasta. It is very simple to make but tastes like you slaved over the dish.

Super delish!!!!!! AND Super easy!!!!! My family hammered this dish and my daughter & I are not big shrimp fans. I love seafood and shrimp are good but they are at the bottom of my seafood list. However...this dish it at the top!!! I tweaked the recipe a little. I used more shrimp then called for.. about 1 1/2 lbs but a little less breadcrumbs..about 1/4 cup and more Romano cheese...a bit less then 1/2 cup. I also used Marinated artichoke hearts (I love these and will eat them right out of the jar!) We served this with whole wheat thin spaghetti and salad. Next time I will add some asparagus to it! DELISH!!!! Thank you!! :)

I wish that I could give this recipe more than 3 stars - but I wasn't that crazy about it.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, even went to Tony's Meat Market to get the best shrimp as well as the pricey romano cheese.  I made it for my daughter for Valentine's day and neither of us were that impressed, which was a huge dissappointment since this recipe got such great reviews.  I wouldn't say that it tasted bad, but I wouldn't spend the money to make it again.  Sorry Milonek

Great recipe.  Didn't change much except added some white wine to the butter mixture; if you do add wine be careful with the lemon and increased acidity.  Rather than bread crumbs I used Parmesan/Herb Panko; panko makes a much better topping than breadcrumbs. Topped with a little more cheese.  It was delicious and will definitely make it again.  I think this would be good with chicken as well.

Fabulous recipe! Easy, quick and very delicious. If you're not a big fan of lemon, I would suggest using half of a lemon instead of one whole lemon because the lemon flavor is strong. Otherwise, highly recommended dish. I served over rice and it was a big hit!

I'm going to give this two stars.  We were very disappointed considering what great reviews it got.  I'm going to try it again.  It may be my fault.  What not to do:  I used frozen (raw) shrimp.  I thought it was thawed out, but wasn't.  So, it created a lot of juice, which made it very runny and fishy :(

This is simply amazing. So easy, so fresh!  I could give this 100 stars if I could.  I only used half a lemon....we aren't huge lemon lovers.  I think the flavor was just fine with half the lemon.  I'm really not sure how you can go wrong with this.  This tastes like something you would order at a restaurant. I'm pretty sure that this will be our new indulgence for a treat!  AWESOME.

This recipe was very good!  Well-seasoned and crispy.  I wasn't sure if the shrimp would get cooked all the way, but they were perfect.  I wasn't very fond of the artichoke hearts (a first for me).  The only ones I saw at the store were 'marinated'.  Do they come any other way?  I tried to rinse them, but they were still pretty tangy, especially with the lemon juice.  I served this with pasta, but I think next time I would try to make some sort of additional sauce to go with it.  It was a little dry by itself.  Overall, a very good dish.

Very good and light pasta dish. As recommended by others I used half the juice of a lemon. Next time I will make sure to only cover shrimp because the artichokes really absorbed the lemon juice which I did not enjoy. I seasoned my shrimp with a little cayenne pepper and seasoned salt because of my fear of the dish being bland (next time I'll try a little Old Bay Seafood seaoning). I served it with a peas, mushroom, onion, black pepper and fresh garlic mixture I sauteed in a little olive oil. Once done I added it to the angel hair pasta tossed it and let it sit in a large pot to absorb some the flavors. I can appreciate a light pasta dish. Will make again and again.

Excellent! I added sherry to the butter/garlic and also Parmesan as well as the Romano cheese (because I like it) but otherwise cooked as-is. I also used more cheese than suggested. :) Very tasty. Served over fettuccine with a side of steamed asparagus for dinner tonight! MMMM!

This was AWESOME. I modified it a bit after reading other reviews. I used half olive oil half butter, tossed in a few capers, added 2T white wine to the butter, half of the bread crumbs called for, 2 t garlic, medium shrimp. 375 for 8 minutes, under the broiler 'til browned. Served it over angel hair pasta. My  guests were raving. You have to try this!! (in the future I'll use Smart Balance instead of the butter- just had to be bad this once)

Excellent!  I substituted 1/4 c. extra virgin olive oil and and 1/4 c. of a 0% trans fat "butter" spread for the butter.  Would like to try this with Tilapia.

This was wonderful!  I altered it by adding another 1/4 C butter and 1/2 C dry white wine in the pan while melting the butter and garlic.  Cutting juice to 1/2 a lemon as I don't like the lemon to be overpowering.  Add cut fresh asparagus & mushrooms.  What a great dinner to impress friends and so easy!  Thanks!

A keeper!  So good!  I used Francesca's recommendation of cutting the butter in half and adding in olive oil and it was perfection.  I won't change a thing and will definitely make again.

For Barbedwards:  I imagine an allergy to lemon would include all citrus but if not, white grapefruit would be a refreshing flavor, or lime.  Otherwise, leave it out and stress the garlic flavor by adding 2 or 3 more minced cloves.

The only thing I changed was to use marinated artichoke hearts because they have flavor. I drained two small jars...but maybe next time only drain one (maybe none) to have more of a sauce...I used less butter too. I baked for the specified time then hit the broiler to brown it till pretty! It went over well with the BF and I will make it again...

This was amazing!  I used already cooked shrimp and marinated artichoke hearts so I didn't cook it for the full time.  Served with angel hair pasta for a nice Valentine's Day dinner.

Delicious! I've made this 2-3 times now, very easy and tasty. I love the addition and flavor of artichokes with the shrimp. I used Parmesan cheese because that's what I had and used enough to sprinkle over the entire surface.

This was absoulety WONDERFUL!   Didnt have to tweek anything except I added a tad bit of cayenne pepper. ( we like spicy :)  )  Also, I served it on rice instead of angel hair pasta and a steamed broccoli.   I would have taken a picture, but it was all gone in moments, lol. Thank you for sharing your fab receipe!

lemony, buttery goodness! followed the recipe as written, except omitted the fresh parsley and the romano because i had none (and, frankly, this dish is so decadent that the cheese is unnecessary). served over thin spaghetti (only pasta i had in the house), and husband loved it.

Excellent recipe. I used half butter and half olive oil to cut down on saturated fats. I made this for company and one gentleman said he doesn't like artichokes but in this recipe they are great. He had seconds. LOL. This recipe is perfect for serving guests either as is or with pasta on the side. Thanks for a great recipe.

I took the advice of another reviewer and added some veggies to make this great recipe a complete, balanced meal.  I lined the bottom of the pan with 8 oz raw spinach.  I coated the raw shrimp in Old Bay before putting it on top of the spinach.  In addition to the artichokes I added broccoli and cauliflower florets (lightly coated in olive oil, minced garlic and Tony Cacheres).  3T butter was plenty for that "scampi" result. Definitely broil at the end to brown the bread crumbs slightly.  Yum!

Very good recipe!  A nice change from shrimp scampi!  I did use  Italian Panko and it had a nice crunch - but I might have preferred the breadcrumbs and will try that next time.  I took Francesca's comments and added halved cherry tomatoes and it was delicious.  Will make it again!

This was so easy - it took longer to peel the shrimp than to assemble the ingredients.  It was delicious!  I served with white rice and spinach that i cooked in the butter/garlic pan so it soaked up the last bits.  Make sure to use fresh garlic and lots of it and pair it with a chilled viognier.

This was awesome!  I don't even like shrimp and I thought it was great. I did use marinated artichoke hearts from a jar instead of canned in water. I also used juice from a Meyer lemon which is not so tart/sour as a regular lemon. I served over linguine with a sprinkle of Asiago cheese instead of Parmesan. Fast and easy!  Great recipe!!

This was disappointing.  I didn't like the taste of the baked shrimp.  If I made it again I would leave out the shrimp and just add double the artichoke.  Most likely I won't be making this recipe again.

Very good, put some chicken stock in the bottom of the dish to keep it from drying out. Also broiled for a few minutes to get a nice brown crusty top on it

It had a good taste but I wish it would have been a little crunchier.  On the other hand, my husband and my son loved it.

Five stars for ease of preparation and look. Four for taste - I think my family (husband) likes a "saucier" dish.

This is one of my family's favorite shrimp recipes EVER!  My daughters made it on Mother's Day, the first time we'd ever tried it.  My 15-yr old made it after I found the recipe.  WOW!!  We have not modified the recipe at all, other than to double it for my family.  It is quick, easy, and delicious.  My husband loves the leftovers for lunch and his co-workers go crazy when he brings it in for lunch!  Simply delicious.

Absolutely wonderful just the way it is.  Thank you for posting it.  I used it for a luncheon, served over rice.  Simple, and heavenly.

I so wanted to like this but neither my hubby nor I did. It was edible but didn't do anything for us. I cut down on the butter and maybe for that reason we felt  like something was missing although I added more olive oil. I also thought 
It was too lemony. I served it over linguine and it  could have used more sauce but again, I was trying to be healthy. I would just go with a shrimp scampi or Alfredo instead.

This was, as suggested, very quick & easy -- and, in fact, I had all the ingredients on hand already.  Hubby raved over it.  I think it will be a good company dish, as it preps like a casserole, but the finished product does not suggest that it is.  This one goes in my "I love to Cook Book"!

My husband raved about this recipe. I used parmesan cheese instead of romano. Perhaps next time I will use the romano.

Followed the recipe exactly except added some capers and loved the result! It was tasty, shrimp were perfectly cooked, served it with buttered vermicelli as suggested, and garlic bread and salad. Perfect meal with raves all around from my husband and our guest. Would definitely recommend this and will certainly make it often. Highly recommend it.

SO easy! SO yummy!  I spread some cut-up asparagus along bottom of dish, then the shrimp and artichoke hearts, and used panko and whatever italian seasonings I had available (salt, ground pepper, sage, basil, oregano), added lemon, and combined with EVOO and melted margarine and minced garlic to spread on mixture.  Then I topped with shaved parm. Baked for 12 minutes, left in warm oven for 5 minutes (waiting for husband), then broiled on low for 1 minute.  Served with a side of Quinoa.  So perfect, will definitely make this again and again!

I liked the simplicity of this dish. While I did enjoy it I just didn't find it fantastic or as flavorful as I thought it would be. The rest of my family said they enjoyed it so that was a good thing.

Even though my kids aren't crazy about artichoke hearts, they gave this recipe 5 stars. I left out the lemon juice since I don't like it and didn't really measure the Romano cheese. I just sprinkled it on until it looked good. It was more than the TBL. I was nervous we wouldn't like this recipe when I was putting it all together but was pleasantly surprised at the yummy taste.

Fresh shrimp was on sale; I couldn't resist. I also wanted a "butter forward" recipe to highlight my homemade cultured butter. Milonek's shrimp Francesca to the rescue! Thank you! I tend to dislike reviews where the reviewer spends all their words explaining how they modified a recipe, but now I shamefully join their ranks as I think it might be beneficial for others cooking for just one or two. I wanted this over pasta and was only making 1/2 lb of shrimp. I felt the reduced amount of sauce wouldn't be enough. Therefore, I kept all the liquid ratios as for a pound of shrimp, but reduced all the other ingredients and baked it in a 10 in pie pan. it turned out wonderful. I will definitely be making this again and again.

This was so simple,and fast the hardest part was chopping parsley & garlic. Went together fast loved the flavors, served with garlic orzo and steamed broccoli. Boyfriend said that's a keeper you'll have to make that again. Would be an easy recipe if you were entertaining, or short notice guests.

Meh... I made this last night with angel hair pasta and sugar snap peas. I have two young boys who love shrimp and I thought this would be a "no leftovers" kind of dinner, but they really weren't interested. I used 2 pounds of shrimp (thawed from frozen) because my kids love them so much. I made only a few alterations: no artichokes because my kids would just pick them out, I sprinkled the bread crumbs over the shrimp and stirred them to coat, and I used dried parsley for convenience. Next time, and I think I'll give it another try, I will use 1/2 the butter. Even with 2 lbs of shrimp, the 1/2 cup of butter was just too much. The lemon juice was a nice addition.

I fixed this for my wife for Valentines day alongside a salad of mixed field greens, with apples and walnuts and a raspberry vinaigrette. While Chardonnay would have been better, we had red wine with it and it worked just fine!  Overall it was great!  The recipe would be better if something was used as a sauce, perhaps white wine or a lemon caper butter sauce.  Overall thumbs up and it was a great Valentines dish!

Whole family loved this one and it was so quick and easy!! I didn't have artichoke hearts, so left those out and used a cheese mix I had instead of the Romano. Turned out great. Served over couscous with asparagus.

Absolutely fabulous.  The buttered bread crumbs and garlic mixture made everything so delicious.  Served over buttered angel hair pasta which I added a bit of Italian Seasoning and garlic powder.  My husband loved it.

Very good. Much like Scampi but the bread crumbs gave it a different texture. Easy to put together.  I will lighten up on the amount of lemon juice next because it was almost a little overwhelming, but I used a large lemon and squeezed every bit of juice out.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I just used dried.  I also substituted shredded parmesan for romano because that's what I had.  I served over lightly buttered linguini.  Will definately make this again. Next time I think I will serve it on a puff pastry pizza.

This was very good and simple to make.  I used Panko crumbs instead of bread crumbs to make it lighter.  I added a little bit of white wine to it when I added the lemon and served over angel hair pasta.  A great dish for Lent!

This is resturant quality! I served it over a bed of angel hair pasta covered in a garlic olive oil sauce and then topped with more cheese, it was just to die for!

This was a terrific recipe, and very easy to make.  It will be a keeper.  I did use less butter, as some had suggested.

This is my go to recipe for 'special guests' appertizer.  I usually add some white wine with the lemon and user more garlic than the recipe asks for!  Stupendous, delicious and I always get raves from our guests..they think I am such a good cook?!?

For 6 servings to serve over angel hair pasta, , I cooked the  shells from 2 lbs shrimp, with 1-1/2 cups white wine, 1 stick butter, 1/2 C EVOO, 1 T. Italian seasoning, 1/4 t. red pepper flakes, the parsley, garlic (I use more than recipe says) , 2 lemons juiced, 1 T dry minced onion for half hour covered (since I wanted more  sauce). Drained solids out then poured sauce over the shrimp, 2 cans drained artichoke hearts and bread crumbs. Used crushed salad croutons instead of bread crumbs with  2 t. Italian seasoning, then sprinkled more lemon juice and minced parsley over all with the cheese. I had to cook it for 35-40 minutes in 375 oven before shrimp were cooked (still juicy and plump) and added halved cherry tomatoes all over the top (probably about 10 or more) for the last 15 min.   My oven cooks "slow" so 10-12 total min. just didn't cook it through.  Had to add about 1C of pasta cooking liquid to make enough sauce . The final dish looks very pretty with the red tomatoes and green parsley and Italian seasoning on it. Sprinkle with more Romano or Parmesan cheese and serve. My family raved about it. The shrimp stock/sauce gives it a real depth in flavor and the extra lemon and garlic give it a glorified "Shrimp Scampi" taste & look.  May try it with marinated artichoke hearts the next time  since they have the same seasoning and oil.

I really wanted to love this recipe.  I'm a huge fan of shrimp, artichokes, garlic, and cheese.  How could I not love it, right?  It was edible but that's about as high of a compliment as I can give it.  There was NO sauce so I'm not sure why it is suggested to serve it over rice or noodles.  The bread crumbs were unneccessary and didn't add anything to the taste of the dinner.  I made the recipe as is, but if I make it again, I will leave off the bread crumbs and use feta or gorganzola cheese.  I think it needs a softer cheese to give it a little more juice.

This was just ok even though I REALLY wanted to love it like most of the other reviewers.  I think maybe the combination of the lemon juice and the cheese just didn't do it for me.  I will use the basic gist of the recipe again but will use either the lemon juice OR the cheese and I will add more garlic and some red pepper flakes.  Might skip the breadcrumbs too - they just weren't necessary and didn't add much to the dish other than calories.

OH MY GOODNESS!!! This was SO delicious!  So easy and it tastes like I prepared for hours!  Thank you so much for this wonderful dish!  My daughter just rolled her eyes and said, I think I am at Olive Garden, but I don't have to leave a tip!  My son totally inhaled it and gave me a huge kiss!  This is a KEEPER, I will make again, and again!  Anyone who don't love this, their tastebuds are either on vacation or they don't have any!! Did I say this was yummy????

This was a really great recipe and a good way to use artichokes.  I haven't used them before, but wanted to add them to our diet, and this recipe was great.  I don't use butter and didn't have the cheese.  So, I sprinkled some olive oil on top of the crumbs and about 15 minutes before they were done, stirred in the crumbs so they wouldn't be dry sitting on the top.  It was yummy.  Just served them alone with a salad and sliced tomatoes.  Very good.  Will definitely make again.

Expected to like/love this based on the reviews.  I followed the recipe except substituted canned mushrooms for the artichokes, but that wasn't the problem.  I thought it called for too much garlic, but we barely tasted it (we love garlic).  It has too much lemon juice and way too much bread crumbs for our taste.  Probably won't make this again.

Quick and easy.  My friend is gluten free and I used gluten free bread crumbs.  It worked great.  I just bought quartered artichoke hearts to keep it simpler.  We did cut back the garlic to about 3/4 tablespoon of garlic which seemed the right amount for us.  Glad I made it.

OMGosh!  My man made this dish for the two of us for dinner along with another dish from here ((Out of the Hat Rice.)  Fabulouso..... I picked what I wanted after reading reviews.  He made both recipes exactly as called for.  Very very good.  Lemony, but we knew that going into it because both recipes call for the juice of one lemon.  Oh, I love someone cooking for me once in a while....

I layered the shrimp and artichokes, covered with olive oil, garlic, white wine and lemon juice.  Topped with panko bread crumbs, added 1/4 melted butter and topped with romano cheese. Served with garlic bread.  Wonderful!

I loved this recipe.  It's easy and quick and it tastes like something you would get in a fine restaurant.  I didn't have fresh parsley so I used basil and I also used more Romano cheese on top.  It had a great lemony flavor, too.  Next time I'll add more butter and make it a little more like shrimp scampi.  I served it over rice and it was really outstanding.  I know I'll make this a lot in the future.

WOW!  I have a new favorite dish!  This is so good!  Big hit with the family.  I used shrimp and scallops, and panko bread crumbs instead of the Italian.  I also used two cans of artichoke hearts because we like them so much.  This recipe would be great using chicken instead of shellfish also.

YUMMY!  I made this last night & followed the recipe with a couple additions.  I added grape tomatoes cut in half on top.  Then I sauted about 1/2 of an onion with the garlic in a little butter then added the rest of the butter to melt before drizzling it over the top.  I've never cooked shrimp in a way that you couldn't really see it change color so I was a bit nervous not knowing if it was cooked so I left it in a bit longer then put the oven on broil for a bit as well.  It was delicious & I will make this dish again & again.  Yes, I too have it in my frig and can't wait to heat it up for lunch leftovers!

Not only quick and easy it was absolutely delicious. Not a bite left in the pan. I served it with angel hair pasta in a light parm. cheese sauce. A definite keeper! Fancy enough for company.

This isn't as great as I anticipated. When I saw the five stars, I thought it was a keeper. Needless to say, the calories aren't worth it. The breadcrumbs are awful in this recipe. I even tried broiling it. Perhaps cutting down the breadcrumbs and adding white wine would make it a bit better, but I will not make the mistake of cooking such an expensive meal for results as such!

Couldn't find another place to ask this question so will do it here.  I would love to try this recipe, but my other half is allergic to lemon.  How will that affect this dish and is there something I can substitute?  Any suggestions?

It’s really good. I thaw the frozen shrimp and cook it otherwise according to directions. My husband likes a little heat so I add pepper flakes. I do cut the butter with a little olive oil. He asks for this a lot.

This was so easy and delicious! I chopped up the canned artichokes and patted in between and on top of the shrimp layer. Also small changes- I used about 4 T of fresh chopped parsley, an extra hit on the breadcrumbs and 6 cloves of minced garlic into the butter topping while it was melting. I also increased heat to 425 for the last 10 min of baking for a nice brown on the crumb butter mixture. Made a rice pilaf and a quick salad while it was in the oven- fantastic dinner in 40 minutes-this is a win!

This dish is easy, fast, and tastes like 5 stars! The first time I made it I followed the recipe to the tee. This time, much to my chagrin, I did not have artichokes, so I scrounged for what I had...broccoli, celery, portabello mushrooms, and sweet peppers. I sauteed those veggies in olive oil with garlic, then spread them over the shrimp- which I had seasoned a bit with Hidden Cover Lemon Garlic Blend. I then put the  Italian seasoned bread crumb mixture-- which I had to improvise a bit also with shredded sharp cheddar and Romano cheese. This dish is so tasty!

This was really, really good! I added about 1/3 cup white wine, a few drops of tabasco, and some halved cherry tomatoes to make it a bit saucier. Served it over rice pilaf.  My husband said "don't forget this recipe!"

Excellent concept.  I made it as directed but used refrigerated fresh egg pasta supermarket brand. As much as I like heat and like my chili’s to have some kick and please don’t serve me mild buffalo wings, and my pantry has some 20 hot sauces, the amount of red pepper flakes in this recipe is over the top.  Would I cut in half? Probably not. But certainly by a third.   Others complained about the sauce being to thin. Not in my case . In fact I reserved a little pasta cooking water and added a 1/2 cup to the sauté pan with the pasta.  Perfect on the consistency level and flavor level. Probably the first time in my life I have complained about too much pepper.  perhaps it because I consume pepper, pure chili pepper, pepper flakes , paprika etc in considerable quantities, mine is usually fresh.

I reduced the receipe to fit just 2 of us. Too much butter. I may try again and do as suggested and use half oil half butter. With smaller serving, also found it cooked very fast. I think I over baked it just a bit at about 10 minutes. Keep an eye on it when baking.

While my husband and I found this edible I wont make again. I really didnt like the flavor of the artichokes with the dish. To make things easier I combined the butter, garlic, and lemon juice together and drizzled. I did not find the coating to be mushy as other reviewers have said, but I did find it bland.

Made this last night and everyone loved it. The only change I was was using marinated artichoke hearts because that’s what was in the pantry. We all agreed the marinated artichokes added a nice touch. Next time I make this, and I will, I will add a splash of white wine to the garlic butter and maybe some sliced grape tomatoes..But it is wonderful as is.

Loved this recipe, it was a hit with my entire family including the kids! I served it over rice and used garlic oil because I was out of garlic. The breadcrumbs were a little soggy even though I put it under the broiler for a few minutes, it still tasted amazing though!

I loved this recipe, although I did make a few tweaks out of necessity.  I couldn't find an 8 oz can of artichokes so I had to use a 14 oz can.  Also, I improvised with the bread crumbs and used panko with Italian seasoning added.  Everything else stayed the same and I served it on a bed of creamy parmesan risotto.  Big hit!

Great recipe, everyone always loves it! After making it a few times I noticed that the artichoke hearts seem to go fast, so now I double the amount of artichoke hearts when I make this recipe. I have found that the recipe turns out equally as well if Romano or parmesan is used, so that is one ingredient with wiggle room. I would not recommend substituting margarine for the butter, but you could go a bit lighter on the butter if that is a concern for you.

I didn't have any Italian bread crumbs in the cupboard so I just mixed some panko with some Italian seasoning. Wow! Great dish done in no time. I served it with wild rice and it was amazing. It is definitely a keeper!

This was amazing.  I would not have thought about baking it in the oven but it worked out very well.  I think serving it over a more dense pasta would be best. I did use angel hair and it just clumped up under the cooked shrimp.  (My fault for sure.) I should have served it over orzo and I'm sure it would have been fine.

I think I died and went to food heaven!!!  I followed the recipe for the better part but I thought it would be fun to use unsalted butter, crushed red pepper flakes and freshly ground black pepper with a little kosher salt.  I think next time I will add the compound butter mixture to the breadcrumbs to ensure a better consistency when topping the shrimp and artichokes.  Otherwise, I thought this reminded me of the Spiedino di Mare at Carrabba's, which I have been looking for a copycat recipe for the longest time.  Definitely going to make this again ??

I used asparagus instead of artichoke. put it on top of a little fettucine with the butter/garlic sauce. My husband said I could make that any time.

this is really good - even if you tweak it  a bit for what you have on hand.  I used a bag of cooked medium shrimp, removed tails, and only had about 1/8 of a lemon - used more cheese and had to broil it a bit and it was delicious on angel hair pasta.  Next time I will save the parsley for top after cooking as it turned very dark and unattractive after baking and next time try to have a whole lemon in the house but my husband said it was restaurant quality.  I used Progresso Italian bread crumbs and seasoned the shrimp with seasoned salt .  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was pretty dang good, but I didn't care for the artichoke hearts. They added a sourness that I didn't like. Will maybe try a different vegetable next time. Shrimp came out so good though! Super yummy flavor!

The first time I made this, it turned out perfect.  The second time, it was very dry and mushy.  I realized that my mistake was that I assembled it too early, and let it sit until the rice side dish was almost done.  Sitting 10 minutes with the breadcrumbs and butter before putting it in the oven did it in.  So my only advice is not to assemble until you are ready to put it in the oven.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it wasn't to my taste. The bread crumbs got soggy (maybe putting it under the broiler as other reviewers suggested would have helped with that). The taste wasn't anything special, and I didn't really think the artichokes worked well, the flavors just seemed off.

I'm giving the three out of five stars because I felt the artichokes that were added either need to be fresh or frozen. I used artichokes at that were in water but I believe there's some sort of salt water solution in there that flavored the dish.  I rinse the artichokes really well before I added them to the dish, but it didn't help.  The other reason for giving an average of leftovers are not good. The breadcrumbs tend to get mushy and that is a turn off. Overall the recipe is average and can be improved.

Delicious and easy. Served with buttered spaghetti and garlic bread. I also added diced roma tomatoes to the dish before baking. The whole family enjoyed. I could see doubling this for a crowd.

I made this exactly according to the recipe, but there was way too much Lemon!  I think 1 tsp, perhaps added to the butter,  would be plenty.  All that lemon ruined it for us.

This was INCREDIBLY GOOD!  and RIDICULOUSLY EASY!  I made this on a week night, because it looked super easy and had great reviews...my boyfriend was BLOWN AWAY ...so was I!!! It was 100% fine restaurant quality (we used fresh farmer's market shrimp which certainly put it over the top).  I doubled the recipes, not really measuring anything, but using all the recommended ingredients, and it turned out DELICIOUS!!!  What's even more amazing is that the leftovers (yes, leftover shrimp which is usually YUCK) were ALMOST BETTER THAN THE NIGHT OF!  Reheat in a saute pan WITH the angel hair pasta, and it is FANTASTIC!  This will be put in monthly meal rotation in our house!

Fantastic recipe! Nice and light and flavorful. Served it as a meal with angel hair aglio e olio. Made just some minor revisions...used panko v bread crumbs and finished it off until the broiler for a couple minutes. Used fresh local, 21-25 shrimp. Heavenly

We love this!  It sounds gross with the artichoke hearts, but they give it a nice flavor, and it would not taste as great without them.  I was looking for something to do with shrimp other than the usual stuff, and this was perfect!  I will make this again, exactly as written.

It was quick to do.  From beginning to end it was about 40 mins.  This was tasty and just as good as you would get in a restaurant.  It was served with wheat pasta.  When I make this again, I will cut some asparagus up and combine it with the artichokes.  It will be a family favorite!!!!

I think I read every review on this dish before preparing it last night.  It was fantastic and I really didn't change the dish much except taking some reviewers suggestions and added about 1/4 cup of capers and 1/4 cup of white wine.  I used half olive oil and half butter and used parmesan cheese because I didn't have Romano.  I served this over angel hair tossed with olive oil and salt and pepper.  Also, I used frozen artichoke hearts as I prefer them over canned.  Very simple and delicious.  I would definitely make again and would not hesitate serving this to company.

What can I say?  This was an EXQUISITE recipe!!  I went all in on my first attempt, doubled the ingredients and threw some diced tomato on top for color (had left in the fridge and needed to use anyhow) and the results were fantastic!!  No need to change a thing;  this will be my dinner for impressing guests in the future!  Note to aspiring cooks that are contemplating this recipe:  If you dont like artichokes, then you probably wont like this dish.  Dont make it and then complain about the artichokes lol!

This recipe is delicious and very quick to make, yet tastes like a gourmet meal. I only used about a 1/4  cup of butter and used dried parsley because I didn't have fresh. I also used artichoke hearts in oil, which tasted great. I drained off some of the oil before placing it into the pan. I will definitely make this again and plan on serving it over garlic rice. If you serve it over angel hair pasta, be sure to coat the pasta with plenty of butter, cheese and lemon juice because the shrimp didn't produce any sauce to help flavor the pasta.

Fantastic! A great quick fix dinner that impresses. I used frozen then defrosted  artichoke heart quarters ( much better than the jar stuff). Also added an extra 1/4c panko for extra crunch.  Served with a pesto/alfredo fettuccine & spinach/kale salad with lemon vinaigrette.   Crusty bread on the side.  Perfection  in just a half hour in the kitchen!

This was just okay in my book. If I were to make it in the future I would pour the melted butter, garlic, and lemon juice over the shrimp and artichokes, toast the bread crumbs separately and scatter them over all and then, before putting it in the oven, put the grated Romano cheese over the entire casserole. This should avoid the soggy bread crumbs I encountered.

I used panko crumbs mixed with parmesan. I could not find 8 oz. cans of  artichokes so used a larger can which had 8-10 artichokes anyway. This was a good dish which I'll make again.

This is a very easy and delicious shrimp dish.  I put under the broiler for a couple of minutes to finish browning the dish.  Then I served  it over spaghetti squash, yummy.  This will be a regular dinner in our house.

Fabulous and SO easy as I had shrimp that were already peeled and deveined!   If I could give this more stars I would.  Following the suggestions of some others, I did use half EVOO and half butter.  Also used panko as I didn't have  bread crumbs.  Baked for 10 minutes then turned on the broiler for just a bit of browning.   Thank you for an awesome shrimp recipe that I will definitely be making more often!

Excellent. After cooking the noodles I tossed them with a little olive oil. That way they were moist when putting shrimp on top. Very good.

This was  a wonderful addition to my recipe box!  I made no additions or changes except that I used grated Parmesan Cheese as I had it on hand. My partner told me it was one of the top dishes I had ever made for him. I think it will be easy to do for company as well. I give it five stars. Leslie B.

So yummy! Next time I might use a small lemon or half of a large one. Also, the artichoke brand I picked wasn't very good. I needed to pull the outer layer off of each quarter. I only had Panko bread crumbs but I added garlic salt and Italian seasoning to make them Italian bread crumbs

Very good. I did add a generous splash of white wine with the lemon. Didn't have Romono to grate but used Asiego instead which worked well. Be generous with the bread crumb and cheese topping. I did add a sprinkle of capers to add an addition flavor profile. Next time I will cut back on the lemon a little and think I'll bake for 10 min. and finish with a careful top broil to crisp up the topping.  If everything is preped this is quick and a great choice when entertaining.

Husband doesn't like artichokes so substituted some nice slender stalks of asparagus. Threw in some of French's French fried onions and used more garlic. Served in on linguini. Was VERY good. I will definitely make it again. Husband wanted cream sauce. :( Might try it with flour added to the butter and garlic and a little wine and put in on the serving plates before adding linguini & shrimp.

Very quick and easy.  Used a glass casserole dish so cook time was a tad bit longer than advertised.  Used the shrimp color to determine when cooking complete.  Taste was upper tier restaurant-like and spot on.  Will definitely make again.

This has been one of the easy staples in my house for a few years since I found it on this website!  Family favorite!  I just either half the butter or use Brummel & Brown as a substitute since we can't do a lot of butter in our house!  Super easy and sooooooo yummy!

My husband really liked this, and commented about how good it was served over linguine.  For me, it was good but a little too lemony and a lot too bread crumby. As Francesca suggested, I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil.   I will try again but cut the lemon in half and only use as much crumbs as are needed to lightly sprinkle over 9x13 pan.

Very good, but I was expecting exceptional after reading so many 5 star reviews.  I would probably rate this at 3 1/2 stars if that were an option.  We enjoyed it, and might make it again, but it is not something I would serve at a party or to impress company.  Also, after reading another review, I scaled the recipe to 6 servings to feed 4 people, and it was enough, but just barely, for 4 of us.

The reviews are correct, this is a wonderful recipe. I did use half butter and half olive oil as one suggestion said. I liked that combination. I think it might have been too rich with all butter.  I added grape tomatoes cut into thirds and this did add nice colour as well as flavour.I also substituted dried parsley for fresh. Fresh may have been even better though! I doubled the recipe to feed four adults and then had some leftovers. I don't think one recipe would have been quite enough for four. Served it over spaghettini. Everyone loved this.

this was okay. I would make it again, but not as is - in fact the number of rave reviews surprises me. I feel that 1 lemon is absolute overkill. I used half and found it more than plenty. The amount of garlic called for is obscene. I used 1/2 tsp and it was enough. I would use more parsley next time. I used a little kosher salt and some fresh ground pepper. I would probably fine tune a little more if I made it again.

I've made this recipe several times and each time it has turned out great.  I made it again last night and brought some leftovers for my friend.  She loved it so much she asked me for the recipe.  The last few times I used canned baby artichokes, drained and then as the recipe instructs gently squeeze the juice out with paper towels.  Delish!!

My family did not enjoy this recipe. The taste is an acquired taste so you will either absolutely love the dish or you will completely dislike it. My honest 5 yr old who loves broccoli said the Shrimp Francesca was "HORRIBLE".

This was really good but I used a big lemon and I think it was just a little too much lemon as a result. I also think the shrimp were slightly over

Needed shrimp recipe, sure glad I found this one. Simply delicious!  Used marinated artichokes (what I had) and Parmesan cheese, otherwise followed as written but adjusted got two. This is a keeper. Served with sautéed fresh green beans and grape tomatoes. Big hit.

I love shrimp and I am always looking for new ways to serve them simply and easily.  The only thing I suggest is to remove tail before cooking.  It is so much nicer to be able to just eat everything instead of cutting the tail off after it is cooked while you are eating it.  Nothing worse than empty tail shells on your plate.  The moisture from everything in the recipe makes this a perfect dish to remove the tail shell before cooking.  Congrats on your recipe it is fabulous.

This is a really simple and quick way to prepare shrimp. I served it over quinoa with sauteed asparagus on the side. I had my doubts about the bread crumbs and I worried that the dish would be soggy and taste bland but I was pleasantly surprised- it was delicious.

We loved this recipe.  It was a great new and quick way to prepare shrimp.  I used half butter and half olive oil and parmesan cheese but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I served it over thin spaghetti and had broccoli fried in oil with garlic as a side dish. Delicious!

This was absolutely delicious.  I opted for a more saucy version because I planned to serve over basmati rice.  For extra sauce, I used whatever I had on hand which at the time was white cooking wine and chicken stock.  I also did not have enough bread crumb so I substituted with panko and ground up garlic and herb croutons.  I also added cherry tomatoes, added a dash of cayenne, a small handful of rosemary and a sprinkle of mozzarella.  This recipe can be subject to a multitude of substitutions but whatever you do, don't leave out the shrimp, artichoke hearts or the lemon.  Soooo good! Thank you!

I was interested in the artichoke / shrimp combination. That part was good, however the rest of the recipe is sort of clunky and heavy, even with half EVOO/Butter. The bread crumbs are useless with that much fat in the dish. Am glad I tried it and will find a way to to incorporate the artichoke into Chef John's "Simple Garlic Shrimp" on this site. That recipe seems to be lighter and the shrimp more flavorful than this one in my opinion.

This was so quick and easy, and the combo of flavors was great. Never tasted artichokes with shrimp and I'd like to keep it in mind for other ways to use the combo. All of the butter makes it extra yummy, thought you could probably cut it down by a quarter and still be buttery. I used canned, quartered artichokes. I also had to sub the romano for a taco blend of cheese I had on hand, still great. I used a fresh meyer lemon.

This shrimp was very tasty served over pasta.  I had a little less shrimp and a little more artichokes than called for.  The lemon juice, parsley, and Romano cheese I used were all fresh which I think made a big difference.

I used frozen artichokes and large shrimp and langustine tails- defrosted and dried.  Fresh flat leaf parsley, 1% milk. quality Romano cheese.  Great company dish! Will be making this at least a couple times a month.  maybe change out the seafood a little.

Great recipe! I made it for a crowd, i doubled it also I improvised a bit. I added thin asparagus cut in half and red cherry peppers from the deli bar diced up.  Used less bread crumbs and added wine to the butter, garlic and lemon, it was a huge hit and would make it again!  Thanks for the recipe.... JULIE D

Very simple and pleasant dish.  I would never use this if I wanted to absolutely impress someone but it makes for a good weekday meal.  I served my shrimp over buttered linguine.  I do like how healthy this is though.

Fantastico! I used italian panko and marinated artichokes (instead of water packed). I paired it with whole wheat linguini, using the marinade from the artichokes on the pasta. Great stuff!

Very good, but rich. The only thing I did differently was use marinated artichoke hearts (that is what I had on hand). It took closer to 35 minutes for the shrimp to cook, but that could be my oven. I served it with pasta tossed with olive oil, garlic and Parmesan cheese.

I'm going to be "that reviewer" and give it a 5 star although I changed the recipe. I used 2 lbs of shrimp because that's what I had. I doubled everything with the exception of the artichoke hearts, but it would have been great with those doubled as well. Also I used half butter, half very fruity olive oil. I also added about 2 T dry sherry to give it a bit of a kick. Very good, my 8 year old really enjoyed the artichoke hearts and that was the first time he had eaten them. I served it over some fettuccine.

Made this the other night for dinner and can't say much good about except it is easy.  I did make one change, I used 1/4 cup of butter instead of 1/2 cup. I served it over pasta in olive oil and garlic instead of buttered noodles, seemed like it had enough butter. Could have just cooked the shrimp in olive oil and garlic, faster cheaper and tastier.

I thought it was delicious with some changes but I have a feeling the original would have been fine on its own. I substituted 1/2 C chicken broth, 1T butter and 1T coconut oil for the 1/2C of butter. I also added 10 olives in quarters. I didn't cook the garlic, just sprinkled it on top and dotted the whole thing with the butter and oil. I used just enough bread crumbs to lightly dust it and it wasn't soggy at all.

I made this for company. It was simple and delicious. I added more garlic because we think you simply cannot use too much. I like the fact that it comes together quickly and cooks quickly.

Wow - this was lovely. Quick to prepare (once I got through the peeling and deveining part: yuck) and clean up was a breeze. I didn't have any fresh parsley or Romano but I'll be sure to have them on hand the next time I make this. The only change I might make is to use slightly less bread crumbs. Thanks Francesca!

Absolutely delicious; Didn't change a thing aside from eyeballing the amounts in order to make it for one.  I would definitely enjoy this over pasta and I'm thinking if you browned chicken in a pan first it would be another delightful addition/substitution.

This is outstanding!  The only additions I made were zest of the  entire lemon sprinkled on top, 1/2 T. parsley w/ 1/2 T. basil and used 1 1/2 lbs of shrimp.  I've made this about a dozen times already and everyone asks for the recipe.  This is truly a winner!

Fixed it as written, except made my own seasoned breadcrumbs by adding dried basil and oregano. Also added some sliced baby portabellas that I had on hand. Served it over brown rice. The first words out of my husband's mouth was, "WOW!". Will definately add it to my favorites folder.

Although a good combination, this dish was pretty bland.  The pasta needs more sauce or something as shrimp and artichoke combination provides little juice.

Made this for guests with pasta and sauteed spinach w/garlic and it was a huge hit.Very easy to do and very flavorful.I mixed everything together for my lunch the next day and it was delicious that way too. The artichokes really make the dish.It is a simple dish to prepare with a "wow" factor

This was ok, but not great -not sure why though since I like all of the ingredients. It was a very easy way to make shrimp..  Will try broccoli instead of artichokes the next time.

We all liked this very much.  In addition to the shrimp, I also added scallops and flounder.

5 Star recipe!!! Even my wife rated it 5 star and that's very good when I cook it. I liked being able to get it all ready and then baking it. And just 10 minutes was perfect. We had angel hair pasta nd a classic salad with it.

I made this for dinner tonight. While my 7 year old did not like the artichoke hearts, but loved everything else about the dish, hubby thought it was excellent. We've been married for a long time and I'm a good cook, and he said it's one of the most delicious dishes I've ever made. It' been an allrecipes day here as I've cooked 2 meals today all courtesy of allrecipes. Thanks for this delicious dish. BTW, I doubled the recipe to get 8 servings...leftovers for tomorrow.

We tried this including 1/2 butter ad 1/2 olive oil, but in the final analysis it still seemed a bit heavy/old fashioned to us. We appear to be in the minority, but did not care for the recipe.

Made this on Wednesday for dinner, served over brown rice, and had enough leftover for two more lunches! This was quick and easy, and I will definitely make it again.  *I spiced the rice with garlic pepper and used garlic salt mixed in w/ the bread crumbs, in place of italian flavored crumbs. Excellent recipe.

This was excellent, my husband loved it.  I would use the juice of half a lemon next time and cut down a bit on the butter.  Certainly a keeper!

This recipe is exceptional! My Husband looked at me, after one bite, and told me he thought it was restaurant quality!  Can't wait to try it out on the Parents and Friends!  I didn't can anything, but will do better at dispersing the lemon and butter/garlic sauce in the next batch.

This was really great. I made it with angel hair lightly tossed in basil, olive oil, garlic and black pepper. Very good. Also made fresh brocolli with it, lightly boiled so it wont lose too much color.

This was delicious, the only thing I did different was top it with Tomato slices.  Added them in the last few minutes of cooking.  YUMMY!!!
