I thought this was quite good, although I only used 1.25 pounds of turkey, which was a mistake.  I should have cut the wet part in half.  Because I didn't, I had to make this into a meatloaf.  But it was still delightful!  The hot sauce adds a nice kick.  I did reduce the pepper to 1 tsp and the seasoned salt to 1 tsp as well.  And I didn't use onions.  Instead I added onion powder and just put the garlic (3 cloves) right in with everything else.  The quinoa really is a nice touch, and I will definitely make this again.

I did not make any changes except to only add one tablespoon of the hot sauce, and my family loved these turkey burgers  I was surprised they didn't fall apart because forming the patties was difficult. The patty mix is very moist. I may add a quarter cup of bread crumbs next time. I also thought they'd be soggy after baking but they weren't.  I cooked them the full 45 minutes and they were browned on top and easy to remove for on buns.

The whole family loved this - patties were more wet than I thought they should be - but when they cooked up they were fantastic!
