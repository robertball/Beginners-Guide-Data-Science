These were good.  They are very cake-like, in fact, I made a batch in my madeleine mould because the batter seemed more muffin like than cookie.  The batter is quite liquid but the cookies hold their shape on the cookie sheet. Cooking times and instructions were right on. I made them gluten free using the Brown Rice Flour Blend from AR and needed no gums or extra binders. The pumpkin and butterscotch flavours mingle well together. Thanks for the recipe Gio_Bowers.

These cookies were pretty good although they have a "cakey" texture. The aroma while baking in the oven was so inviting! I slightly modified it because I had 1 1/2 cups of leftover pumpkin purée from my pumpkin pie. Therefore the changes I've made was to decrease the amount of oil to 1/3. Because I wasn't paying attention, I baked the cookies in a 350ºF preheated oven instead of 325ºF and I also let them cook longer for a couple minutes (I was distracted...lol). After those two mistakes, they still came out amazing and yummy! This recipe is a keeper for when I have pumpkin filling leftovers and I will probably post it on my food blog as well. Bravo!

Delicious! Not too sweet, pumpkiny bread-like texture. 
The recipe mentions 1/4 cup scoops of dough. I'd do tsp size next time as they turned out quite large.

Easy to make, great taste. Added a 1/4 tsp of Ginger and a dash of Cloves along with the Cinnamon. Baked 15 min at 325. Will make again
