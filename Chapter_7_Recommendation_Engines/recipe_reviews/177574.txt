This was good and quick but not amazing.  I did take another reviewers advice and cook the rice seperately and I think that helped.  The sauce was good (hubby thought it was just a little too sweet).  Thanks for the post.

I'd give this recipe a 5 for flavor. I used my electric skillet. The ratio of rice to liquid is off, so I added about a cup of water. I used apricot/pineapple preserves.  I followed the recipe, and the rice never got cooked all the way.In fact,it burnt to the bottom of the skillet and most of the liquid had cooked down so there wasn't much of a sauce. I recommend cooking the rice seprately. Other than that, this was really tasty. Served with a side of summer veggies(squash, zuccini,broccoli,cauliflower).

Really good flavor. Was nervous about using apricot and dijon, but it was good. I cut the pork into pieces and it was very tender. Thanks

I had to make this over completely because I didn't have the correct ingredients. I used peach pie filling instead of the apricot jam. I also cooked the rice seperately since the comments indicated this might be a good idea. So I pilaffed the rice and added a garlic sesame mixture I had from the spice section. Does this look anything like the original recipe? Guess not, but, it gave me a good idea to start with so I could get dinner on the table.

This recipe has an amazing flavor. I just used the ingredients and didn't really follow the directions. I made the rice by the box directions substituting chicken broth for water. I flash fried the pork (about 5 mins on each side) and seasoned them well. Then I used chicken broth, preserves, and mustard to make a sauce. Brought that to a boil then added the pork and let it simmer in the sauce till the meat was cooked all the way through. Finished by mixing it all together.

The sauce had an amazing flavor and the meat was very tender! I would try adding some veggies to make it more of a stir fry but a very good starter recipe!

I made this tonight and forgot to take a photo. We gobbled it up. I did something a little different since I could not find orange marmalade or Dijon mustard in my local grocery store. I used mandarins oranges mixed with raw honey and brown sugar to try to make my own. I used regular mustard, but less since I didnâ€™t want my husband to detect any was in there. Came our very good!
