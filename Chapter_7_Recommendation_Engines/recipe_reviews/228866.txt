Made the recipe as is and it was very tasty, but I felt the predominant flavor was lime and wished there was more of the sweetness from the peach.  The next day I made a batch using one mango (including the juice) instead of peach, mixed it in with the original peach version that was left over and it was just excellent!  The sweetness from the mango and its juices really helped round out the acidity.  The mango also helped to thicken the salsa, giving it a really nice consistency that clung to tortilla chips.  I highly recommend the use of the avocado, which adds to the texture, color and lends a nice creaminess.  Also recommend dicing the avocado, place it in a separate bowl and bathe it in the lemon juice before adding to the salsa, if you use lime instead it makes the avocado a bit tart.  With modifications, guests raved!

I made this for a gathering and it was a huge hit.  Bright and colorful, fresh and delicious, the flavors blend wonderfully.   I served this with chips for an easy and healthy salsa that everyone enjoyed.   Loved it!

Amazing.  I used Thai chili sauce since I didn't have a jalape√±o.  It worked very well.  Everyone raved about it.

I made this last night for appetizer; everyone loved it! Has enough spicy kick but not too hot, the peaches give it a satisfying sweet flavor, I used firm peaches so it would not be too mushy. We used pita chips with sea salt and it tasted wonderful. The avocado is a must!

The only thing that kept this from being a 5-star review is that it was WAY too onion-y.  Maybe the red onion the poster used was very small, but I have only ever seen large red onions for sale.  I should have gone with my gut when I thought it seemed like too much.  I will try adding another peach to the leftovers to see if I can dilute the onion a bit.  Other than that, to prevent the avocado going brown I added the ingredients in the order of citrus juices first, then I tossed the diced avocado in the juices before adding everything else.  I also substituted basil for the cilantro.  I think it could have used more heat, but that is just personal preference.  I served it over broiled salmon tips with a basmati-quinoa pilaf, a spring green salad with blueberry vinaigrette, and fresh broccoli.  The perfect summertime meal!

This is a very delicious salsa!  I used this to go with chicken that I had cooked on stovetop with a few seasonings.  Excellent!  I would make this again for sure!  I like that you can increase the heat with any type of peppers you want because not all jalapenos are created the same!  Thanks for this recipe, *Sherri*!

Needs firm avocados and limited stirring -- mine was a bit mushy, and I over worked bleeding in the juices -- but the family and guests liked the flavor. Worked well with lime chips. Colorful and made a nice contrast to the traditional tomato-based salsa and the hummus I served.

In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit this turned into mango salsa when I couldn't locate fresh peaches in a 25 mile radius.  I tried, though.  I'd already planned to leave the avocado out, as the submitter mentions in the tagline, due to personal preference.  I made my usual parsley for cilantro sub and this was outstanding served a top "Blacked Tuna" from this site.  THANKS for the recipe, *Sherri*!

Made this last night for my Bunco group and it was a huge hit!  Very light and refreshing for a summer evening.  I did cut back a little on the lemon and lime so it wasn't over powering.  Loved it!

Delicious! Because of an abundance of garden produce,  I added about a cup of chopped cantaloupe.  The freshly picked white peaches were the perfect amount of sweet and tart.  This was initially served in a wrap made with a flour tortilla (smeared with a bit of cream cheese), chicken and this delicious salsa.  It's family approved!

Delicious, fresh and pretty!  My peaches weren't very sweet or flavorful, so I cut down a bit on the lime juice and onion just to compensate for that.  We served at a large gathering with blue corn tortilla chips and it was a big hit with everyone!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, Sherri!

I made this for a summer bon fire along with a fresh tomato salsa and this was a huge hit. The entire bowl was devoured. Everyone was asking for the recipe. I made this exactly as written but it sat for over an hour in our cooler due to my travel time. I would not change a thing. Definitely will be making this again! Thank you Sheri.

I was a little skeptical of the combination but since I liked both avocados and peaches I thought I would give it a try.  What a surprise!  It was outstanding , easy to make and had very good flavor.  I did add an extra peach only because I didn't want to loose it before I could eat it.  I will make it again.  Very refreshing.

I've made this a number of times over the last few years and it's always very good! Love the fresh summer peach flavor  mixed with the creamy avocados. We really go for the citrus flavor too and I've started to add the lemon and lime zest also. And my secret ingredient...peach snoops, about half a shot the way the recipe is written, I usually double everything, this is that go!

This is so good! The only thing I added is a large tomato.
