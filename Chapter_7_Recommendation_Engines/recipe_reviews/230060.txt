I can't rate this very well. I myself could only take a small bite....In that bite it was not right and was off putting. While 2 of my daughter's tried in and said it was sweet like an apricot, I was like what? the flavors that are combined with the squash, are not up to par with the pairing with the squash. The squash's sweetness is overpowering and you couldn't taste anything else. I didn't like this at all and neither did my husband and son. Sorry followed to a T and won't be made again, my apologies.

I thought this squash was pretty good.  It is only the second time I have cooked butternut squash (the first was in a lasagna), so I don't have a lot to compare it to.  However, I thought the flavor was nice and I liked the texture that roasting gave to it.  I myself did not find it to be overly sweet and even my husband who doesn't generally like any kind of squash said it was okay.  The hardest part of this recipe was peeling and chopping the squash; I might get the pre-chopped stuff they have at the store next time.

It is easy to make and, of course, it is delicious! We make this squash dish as our all time favorite Thanksgiving side dish. My husband makes this. Always. This time, I found a box of squash cubes at Costco. We just spread it on to the pan, drizzle oil, salt and pepper, and baked it. So easy!

We grown ups loved it! Wasn't a big hit with my children, but a few tolerated this recipe. I combined it with another recipe called Simple Roasted Butternut Squash. The differences were this recipe called for thyme and added cheese, whereas the other used minced garlic cloves and no cheese. So, I added the garlic to this recipe and it turned out yummy.

This dish is delicious!  My family really enjoys butternut squash and we eat it often when I can find it pre-peeled and chopped at the store.  I usually roast it with olive oil, salt, pepper, and garlic so this was a nice twist.  I used Parmesan cheese and we enjoyed the savory on top of the sweetness of the squash.

Good and hearty. Tasted like . . . squash. Needs more herbs and spices to perk it up, make it distinctive. Will try it again, probably using more thyme and adding rosemary, maybe some other herbs.
