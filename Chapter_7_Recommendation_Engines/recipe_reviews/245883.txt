I had never tried pozole before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The salsa verde gives it a tart taste that took a little getting used to. Once the soup simmered, a little bit more than called for, the flavor mellowed and was good. I really liked the sour cream and tortilla chips on it. I didn't have any of the other toppings on hand, but red onion and avocado would have been good. The only major change I made was to use frozen corn, as we are not fans of hominy.

I just made this tonight for the very first time and I couldn’t stop eating it!!!  My hubby had thirds, himself, which is saying a lot since he usually uses more restraint when serving himself.  He also recommended I send the recipe to our youngest son, so he could make it as well.  Definitely a hit with us, and simple enough to be used in regular rotation!  Thanks so much for a great recipe!!!

Love this easy recipe!  Easy-Peasy!   I only made a few changes, especially because we like to “turn up the heat”!   You can easily cut the vegetable oil down to 2 T:   I  Substituted 1 drained 14.5 can ROTEL ( medium w green chili’s) for the 1/2 can chopped tomatoes,    used 8 cloves garlic,   3 tsp. Cumin. & 12 oz. of good Salsa Verde.  The leftovers were even tastier 3 days later.    ENJOY!
