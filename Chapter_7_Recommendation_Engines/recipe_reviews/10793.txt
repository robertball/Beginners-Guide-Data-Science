Very good!  I loved the flavor of the pecans and white chocolate together.  I cut up part of a big chunk of Ghiradeli white chocolate.  I used a bit more than called for...it was delish!  I used my Pampered Chef cookie scoop...and only got 20 cookies.  So good though!  Almost a shortbread type taste.  Love it!

These are amazing cookies. I have added about 1/4 cup more of the white chocolate chips and about the same amount more of flour as well. I can't get enough!! A must try!!

I thought the flavor of these was really good, but they are very fragile and break easily when trying to remove them from the sheet. My husband loved the flavor but was a little frustrated with how easily they fell in his milk.

This ccokie deserves the 5 stars. I too added more white chocolate but I'm sure they would be great just as the recipe states because it's the buttery crunch that does it for me. I may try macadamia nuts next time. I will add this to my recipe box for sure.
Thanks!

These cookies are the bomb! I took others suggestions and used extra white chocolate. My husband really enjoyed these!

I'd give this 6 stars if I could. These cookies were soo good! My husband made them for me (because I always make the baked stuff in our house, he took a turn). Followed the recipe just right. Perfect! Only wish the recipe made more.

Very good cookie. I would suggest adding more white chocolate, but that's just because I love it!

I'm a dough kinda girl and let me tell you that this dough is great! Even with the nuts (I'm not a nut person). My husband demanded I make more as he can't stay out of them. Thanks;)

I doubled the recipe to get 36 cookies.  The only exception was instead of 1 cup (doubled)of white chocolate chips,  I used 1 1/2 cups of Ghirardelli white chocolate chips.  These cookies are terrific. They are so fast and easy to make...If I could give it more stars I would. Someone mentioned they were fragile cookies, I didn't find them to be at all.  I let them cool about 3 minutes on the cookie sheet then transferred them to the cookie rack...they are even great warm is you can't wait for them to cool. Will definitely be making these many more times.

I love white chocolate so I decided to make these..They didn't turn out as I expected. What I liked was that they were chewy, but I think these would of been better with a semi-sweet chocolate. They were a little too bland and the white chocolate almost made them taste too sweet. A decent, and certainly easy, recipe but next time I will try it with a semi-sweet chocolate!

This recipe makes a lot more than 18. My husband thought it was a little sweet for him but they are STILL amazing and definitely addictive. I was surprised that they came out so well even though i did all the mixing/blending by hand. I substituted the pecans with coconut for half the batch and they are ALL great!

What fantastic cookies! I think I might try using 1/2 milk chocolate and 1/2 white chocolate next time, but the recipe as written is very good!

These were fantastic! I did make a few changes. I used white chocolate chips instead of chunks, putting in a cup of them. I also used 1/2 cup of pecans and added a teaspoon of cinnamon. I baked mine for 10 minutes and they came out perfect!

Definitely need to soften the butter before trying to mix it all in. Had lots of trouble getting that creamy texture you’re suppose to get when mixing butter and sugar. Once I incorporated the dry ingredients, I used my hands to do most of the mixing. Ultimately, it’s a good cookie, but sugars could probably be cut back just a tad. Extremely sweet and a little bit gritty.
