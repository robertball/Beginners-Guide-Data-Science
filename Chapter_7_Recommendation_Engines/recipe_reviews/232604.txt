If you haven't tried this cakeâ€¦.. it you should!!! This IS fantastic. The best homemade carrot cake I've ever had. I didn't change the cake recipe at all! I did grate my own carrots but that's it. Moist and flavorful! Loved it! I doubled the frosting recipe as suggested. If you're going to make 9 in cake I think that's a good idea. Probably not necessary if you make a 9x13. I didn't add the lemon peel, just the juice and a tsp of vanilla.
The frosting was great as well. Not too sweet, just enough. Going forward this will be my only carrot cake recipe!!!! YUMMY

LOVED IT!!! Only thing I changed was I needed more icing so I doubled that part. I have people asking for the recipe all the time.

This was a moist carrot cake. I cooked it according to the recipe and it turned out delicious. The lemon cream cheese frosting was a perfect compliment. Everyone raved about it, even the young girl that doesn't like fruit!

I don't like it when someone rates a recipe 5 stars and then makes changes, so with my changes this is 5 stars!!! I did everything the same except here are the changes I made:
I poured the pineapple juice over the raisins, microwaved 60 seconds and set aside, once ready to add I drained them first. I shredded my carrots VERY fine (smallest whole on grater), so I put aprox 3 cups (it's a lot). I added "2" tsp cinnamon, omitted ginger and instead I added 1/2 tsp allspice, and 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I also added 1 cup walnuts (what's carrot cake without them), and 1/2 cup flaked coconut. I baked it in a 9x13 air bake pan for 40 min exactly and it came out perfect!
This is a VERY moist, dense, and flavorful carrot cake (just the way I like it)! Both my son and fiance really liked it too! In fact my fiance (who's usually not a big fan of carrot cake) said "I know what cake I want for my birthday" (he couldn't stop eating it)!
I used the Cream Cheese Frosting 11 by: Janni (on all recipes). Only change I made there was I put a total of 2 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar. Again both my son and fiance said "I really like that frosting"!
Both are a WINNER! I now have my own recipe for whenever I want a great carrot cake! Wish I knew how to add a picture.

Great Cake  
It is a lot of cake to eat for 2 but we did it and enjoyed every bite!   Thought walnuts would be great and added a handful.  
Just loved it.

My first carrot cake and it turned out great! Next time I think I will use pineapple juice in the frosting.

THis was fantastic.  I made a few changes based on the other reviews.  I microwaved the raisins for a few minutes in some of the pineapple juice and let them set while I was preparing other ingredients then drained well..  I also grated fresh carrots with the smallest grater on the food processor blade.  I cut back on the lemon in the frosting so it would not over power the carrot flavor.  I doubled the cinnamon and added some allspice and nutmeg.  THIS cake freezes fantastic.  It tastes just like the day you made it even the frosting.  This is especially beneficial if you do not want to gain 5 pounds!

I made this cake in 2 9 inch layers. I doubled the frosting per other reviews. I did substitute nutmeg for ginger (personal preference).
The cake was moist and very flavorful.

This cake is delicious.  I made the cake as is...added walnuts, my preference.  It was dense, but moist. Just the right amount of spice. I will definitely make it again.  I made it as a sheet cake and the icing was enough to frost it.  I used the recipe, but substituted Nufatchel cheese instead of cream cheese.
