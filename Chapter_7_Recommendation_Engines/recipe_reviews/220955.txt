My family absolutely loved it!!  My daughter who loves to critique our Thanksgiving meal, said she thought the glaze was awesome and very tasty.  One reviewer said they poured this glaze on the ham before cooking it, so I did as well as save some reserve for the table for guests to add onto their slices of ham.  Excellent idea, as this gave it even more flavor.  I cooked my ham in a roaster plus added about a cup of water, scored my ham, added whole cloves in between the scores, poured my glaze on trying to get between the scores and finally covered the entire game with aluminum.  The flavor of the glaze was very sweet, but with yummy cinnamon flavor.  The only bummer was, I should have doubled the recipe so that I could have poured more over the ham before baking and had extra for the leftovers.  It is super quick and easy to make.  Make sure to use real maple syrup, not pancake syrup.  Also heat it up and don't forget to stir it as the brown sugar tends to settle on the bottom, before putting it on the table.  Enjoy!!!

Fantastic and EASY!  I dumped this on some thick ham slices in a casserole dish and threw it in the oven.  Occasionally I spooned some sauce on top of the ham slices.  This might be my new favorite way to eat ham.

Rated for ease of recipe. Have it all put together. Now, do I cook it?  Put it on the ham from the beginning, the middle or after it's cooked?  using my own judgment Will rate again after we eat. here (heaven help us!!)

We made this last night for the Christmas Ham and it was a big hit! My kids, who never agree to like the same things, both loved this glaze. Do not be worried about the amount of cinnamon. It marries well with the syrup and brown sugar. And do leave some glaze at the table, because it is that good.

Made this for last years Christmas ham, and have made it a standard now.  I doubled it, made it with regular syrup because I didn't have "real" maple, and it worked out just fine.  I also added a little bit of pineapple juice to it - not much, but some.  I cut slits into the ham, inserted whole cloves into all of the slits, poured this glaze over it before loosely covering with aluminum foil and putting it in the oven.  I periodically basted the ham with more of the glaze throughout the cooking time.  BEST HAM EVER!!!  Had plenty glaze leftover to pour over individual slices at the dinner table too.  Has become an annual favorite!

The smell,  esp today on Christmas,  just fills my house. I keep going and pouring more on top slowly so it coats nicely,  but find myself licking the spoon alot cause it tastes so great.

I made 5Ã— the amount and, I didn't have enough maple syrup so, I used king's syrup and a little karo syrup to make up the difference. It still turned out great. I'll definitely use this recipe again next Christmas for my ham.

I made this for our work Thanksgiving potluck and made extra sauce if anyone wanted to put it on the ham.  Another employee also made a ham.  Mine was completely gone.  It was so good.  Iâ€™m never using package glaze again!

Delicious! I served it in the side of the ham. Next time, Iâ€™ll make extra and use to baste ham while cooking as well. Thank you for this simple and yummy recipe!

I made it for our family Christmas dinner. Set it to 28 servings and added in one Tbsp. of Ground Ginger. Turned out excellent and a big favorite around the table. Sorry no pictures, it went too fast.

I didn't have enough syrup so I halved the syrup and added 1/4 cup of pineapple juice and it turned into the best candied ham that I've ever had.

I made this exactly as the recipe calls for, loved it on the ham as a glaze and saved some for at the table. Instead of using it on my ham I put it on my sweet potato, I putting it on my butternut squash tonight. We love cinnamon so I'm adding a little extra with the squash

Made this for Thanksgiving and what a hit it was!  I am normally not a big ham eater, I prefer turkey, but  this was delicious!  Everyone loved it, even my pickiest eater!  You do taste all the ingredients, but none are overpowering.  I will continue to make ham this way.  I'm so glad I came across this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly. Wrapped my ham in foil, put it in the oven on a roasting pan. This made the  ham taste FABULOUS.  My 12, 9 & 6 year olds each had seconds. AND ate leftovers the next day without complaint. It's a dinner miracle. Thank you for sharing!!

This really was spectacular.  I agree to make some extra for those who want to add it after serving, but this was definitely the highlight of our Easter dinner.

This Thanksgiving was the first time I baked a ham. I used this recipe and it received raved reviews from my family. In fact I have been asked to bake a Ham for Christmas too. This recipe is simple and I made extra glaze for those that like a little extra syrup on their ham. I warmed the glaze before serving  as an added bonus. I highly recommend trying this recipe.
