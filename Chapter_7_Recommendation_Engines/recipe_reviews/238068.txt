This recipe was good! I tried it with just mangoes and some yogurt, and it was like a typical smoothie. Well done.

I would cut the sugar in half - a bit on the sweet side and instead of water - add your favorite Moscatto!!  BAM!!  :)

Very. Refreshing! I halved the recipe as I was using a bullet blender. The second time I added  some vanilla yogurt . More like a smoothie with the yogurt.

It was okay. Next time I would use less watermelon. All I could taste was it. Didn't add the water no need to. Instead of sugar I add 1 packet of Splenda. And added half of cup of plain low-fat yogurt. Poured over ice

Terrible.  It did not blend well, and then had no real taste to it.

Instead of ice, I used 2 cups of diced frozen organic mangoes. I also used coconut water instead of plain water. It was a light pinkish color until I added hemp protein powder. I didn't add any sugar. For a thicker smoothie, you can add yogurt.  Thanks for the recipe:)

With 5C of watermelon & only one mango, his is a red, not yellow drink, and does *not* need any sugar. It's just OK... I added 1/4 protein powder, ice, & probiotic powder. It needs to be thicker to be a smoothie (other suggest adding yogurt... You could consider frozen bananas to go full-on tropical). Might only use this conceptually as a base if I again have extra mango & watermelon...
