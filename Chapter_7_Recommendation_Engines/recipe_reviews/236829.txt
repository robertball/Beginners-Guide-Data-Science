I was not able to find the shredded cheese mentioned in this recipe so had to use a cheddar blend. Also I used with penne which I had on hand rather than elbows. I only give three stars due to my preference for creamier cheesier mac n cheese and this was not. My wife who likes the drier kind where the cheese sticks to the pasta gave this four stars. I did like the addition of diced tomatoes. If I make this again I will increase the amount of cheese sauce I make.
