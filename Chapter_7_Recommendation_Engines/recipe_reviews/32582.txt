Wow - this is a dessert in a glass!  Tasted like an adult, almond milkshake. If you like the flavour of amaretto then this is a recipe for you.

Incredibly yummy! I used vanilla frozen yogurt since that is what I had and mocha Kahlua for the coffee flavored liqueur. I love almond everything and this recipe is perfectly delicious! Thank you Kitchengirl! I'll be having this one again!
