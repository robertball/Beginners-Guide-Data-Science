These are always a big hit over the summer whether you do hot or sweet sausage patties!  I always fry onions, green, yellow, and red peppers together with a little olive oil and minced garlic sometimes with a splash of red wine.  I never serve these on pita - kaiser rolls or italian rolls are a must. Mustard is good, but homemade marinara or marinated tomatoes are great!

Been making this for years when I BBQ.  People are so pleasantly surprised when I ask them if they want a frank, hamburger or a sweet or hot sausage pattie.  The sausage seems to be the most popular!  I make the pepper and onions the night before (a big batch because people seem to eat it like salad too!).  I use those long Italian frying peppers - they are so sweet and I season the peppers and onions with Goya seasoning while they cook.  You can find the patties premade in the meat section of your supermarket. - I also just use large hamburger buns - toast them on the grill!!!

I used links instead of patties and it tasted wonderful. It fell apart a little, but that's because I cut up the links and used a hamburger bun instead. The taste was great, though.

Dinner doesn't get much easier than this.  This was a huge hit with my husband as he loves sausage and grilled veggies.  I made as written but did not add the mustard or the lettuce.  Served this with Butternut Squash Supreme from this site.  Quick, delicious and easy to put together.

Love these! We did the sweet patties and followed recipe as is.Next time I might add in some yellow and red pepper, as well. They are so good. Quick, easy, and super tasty. This will be my go-to food for when I'm in a hurry. Great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
