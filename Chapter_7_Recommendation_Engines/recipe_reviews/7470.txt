It should be noted that this recipe is for a specific cake...the Lady Baltimore Cake...which is a very light cake.  It isn't necessarily for the typical cake or cupcakes.

I've always thought that cooked icings were more work than they're worth but this one was so easy to make I plan to use it on all my angel food cakes from now on.  Replace the vanilla with flavored extracts and you can get a icing to match any cake!

This is a great merinque frosting. Very fluffy and light. I let the egg whites come to room temp before I whipped them, and after adding the syrup, I beat them for about 10 minutes. Awesome!

This is a very easy to make frosting. I made it for my 8-year old sonÂ´s birthday and he and his friends loved it. I recommend this recipe.

My daughter's favorite cake is angel food with "sticky frosting" like her grandmother and aunt has always made. I have tried many, many recipes but for one reason or another they never quite made the grade (would dry out, develop a crust, etc.).  This recipe is totally what I've been searching for. Used this on an angel food cake for Easter dinner and everyone loved it. This recipe does make a lot of frosting so next time I'll either halve the recipe, make 2 angel food cakes or make one cake and some kind of cupcakes to use up the leftovers. Could possibly be used for the filling in whoopie pies. Many thanks for this recipe!

Soooo delicious!!!  The perfect icing for a Devil's Food Cake or an Angel Food Cake.  I make the Devil's Food cake with this icing every year for myself on my birthday!!  As a matter of fact, I'm baking the DF cake right now then making this frosting; my BD was 07/14/16. How funny is that! :)  I could literally eat the whole recipe of icing right out of the mixing bowl with a spoon...it is just that delicious.  Don't let the name "Lady Baltimore Frosting" fool you; this is basically a 7 Minute Frosting without having to prepare in a double-boiler.   (MidwestChef stated this is specifically for the LB cake...phooey, you can use it for whatever cake you want!)   So, with that said have fun baking and enjoy!

heavenly.  worth the work.  don't be afraid of the thermometer and such (i was) - this is so good you'll be eating spoonfuls before it touches the cake.

OMG, This is reeally GOOD! I made a Angle Food cake and I was looking for a Seven Minute Frosting,and I came upon this recipe,read the reviews,thought I would try it.
It does make lot,to good to throw the left overs away,so I'm going to freeze it{don't know how that will turn out}.
The recipe is really easy to make.
The spreading consisitancy is real easy,not on the runny side like others I have made.
The taste is really good,just the right amount of sweetness.
I already saved this recipe to my recipe box and even copied the recipe out.
This is a definite keeper,and I will make this from now on.
Thanks so much for the awesome frosting recipe.

I have no candy-making experience (soft-ball stage?  What's that?), but found this recipe very easy.  It was so simple, yet turned out better than other cooked-frostings I've tried.

Luscious. It was a little softer than I would have liked for my cupcakes, but the flavor and texture were lovely. Maybe I will whip longer next time?

As a rule I don't like frosting, in fact, I scrape frosting off  my piece of cake because they are all too, too sweet as far as I am concerned.  
On the other hand this frosting is not nearly as sweet and I loved it!!!
As everyone has said, there is way too much for one cake, next time I will only make half of the recipe. I frosted a devil's food cake  with this and they were delicious together!!!

Made no changes, it was SO DELICIOUS!  and talk about Easy with a capital E.  I will definitely be making this again, as often as I can get away with it!  :)
