I love historical recipes, so I thought I'd give this one a try.  Mixed opinions on this recipe, but no one thought it was bad.  It is just different.  It is more like a fudge than what you'd commonly know as a traditional brownie - like the ones from a box.  They are very rich and very dense.  My husband thought they were great; he is a chocolate lover.  I am not a chocolate lover, therefore I found them to be a little too rich for my taste.  I made them EXACTLY as the recipe stated - only exception was I only put walnuts on half of the recipe.  I baked them for 40 minutes, and yes, as stated you cannot use a toothpick to determine if they are done.  I decided to ensure they were done by letting them bake on the longer end of the recommended time and they turned out perfectly.
