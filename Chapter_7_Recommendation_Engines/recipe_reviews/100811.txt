This is a quick version. Put some butter in a wok or large skillet. Slice up the cabbage and add to butter. Stir it around to coat with butter and salt the cabbage lightly. Stir from time to time moving the bottom to the top. Whe you see some nice brown edges and the cabbage become translucent its done. Takes about 10 min. Sprinkle with some Parmesan cheese. Even my 18 month old loves this veggie!!

I make this all time...minus the butter, you don't need it.  I always cook my cabbage in chicken broth.  I also use the leftover broth as a base in vegetable and chicken soups (Freeze in ice cube trays for future use with cooking veggies too). Not to mention that the broth tastes wonderful on its own (especially when you are sickk)!

Very simple, satisfying down home recipe.  Modifications:  I used probably about a tablespoon of butter, and sauteed a whole chopped onion in that before adding the chicken broth.  Cabbage was done way before the recipe said -- took only 20 minutes.  If had cooked for 45 minutes, I think it may have become a soggy, mushy mess.

This is very good. I shredded the cabbage and added grated carrots as well for added color. Salt and pepper is all that is needed! I do however fry cabbage the exact same way minus the broth. I just poor olive oil in and fry it with grated carrots and sometimes a bit of onion. I let it brown slightly and cover so as it steams as well. Just like frying potatoes and onions. I grew up with it being fried in butter but changed to olive oil to be a bit healthier.

I diced onion and lightly sauteed in butter before adding the chicken broth. This is very, very good. For a nice change, try adding crumbled bacon.

This was good. Next time I will use less broth and get it a little browned. I served this as a side dish with the "Scalloped Potatoes 'n' Franks" on this site. I did use smoked brat's instead of hot dogs. Great comfort food combo.

I had some cabbage that I needed to use up and decided to try this. Wow! What a hit. The kids all had seconds and would have thirds if I had had more. I used canola oil and sauteed an onion first before adding the broth and cabbage. Thanks for a winner.

This recipe has the potential to be very delicious, but as written it is bland (hence the three stars). I had to alter it to make it a perfect five. I browned a chopped onion and some bacon cubes before adding the broth and cabbage. When the mixture started to reduce and the cooking time was nearing it's end, then I started spicing. Plenty of black pepper, salt, sugar (yes sugar!), and a few splashes of balsamic vinegar. I let the broth cook out and browned the cabbage a tad. You can serve this delicious cabbage mix many ways. It is great mixed with spiral noodles, mixed with mashed potatoes (like Colcannon), or serve it alongside some bangers and mash. It is a staple at our house because it tastes incredible!

I thought this recipe was great. I especially like it because it didn't use bacon or bacon grease. I am not a big fan of bacon and I have several vegetarians in the family, so it was perfect. I have seen some reviews that they came out soggy or not totally done. I used another recipe from allrecipes and soaked them in sugar water and they have always been perfect. I do up the spice amounts though.

My family has always enjoyed "fried" cabbage. Mom used to make it with bacon and cook it in the bacon drippings..yummy, but not so healthful. I LOVE this recipe!!! so easy and so  tasty!! And it keeps the cabbage healthy. Didn't change a thing!!!

This was simple and delicious with cabbage straight from the garden! It really showcased the sweetness of fresh cabbage vs. cabbage from the grocery store! I took the advice of a previous reviewer and sauteed an onion in 2 Tbs. of butter then added the broth, cabbage, salt and pepper to simmer for an hour. Yummy!

This was pretty good. The broth infused the cabbage with a lot of flavor. Next time I would cut the liquid in half, as it cooked in only about 20 minutes or so. I used the butter for the top after it was cooked with black pepper. Yum!

Good recipe for cabbage.  However I did make a few changes (of course~) Did not use the chicken broth.  Sauteed shredded cabbage (put in food processor) in cast iron skillet  with melted butter and sauteed onions. Does NOT take 45 minutes. Put in a little onion and garlic powder and then a chicken boullion cube with a little water.  This was good with egg noodles.

An easy variation is to skip the broth and have cold, cooked egg noodles chopped up and ready.  When the cabbage is near completion in the frying process, add the noodles and a bit more butter and continue frying till the noodles begin to brown slightly.  We grew up on "cabbage and noodles" prepared this way.

I give this recipe five stars because it's incredibly easy AND really tasty.  Great as written, but also turns out well using vegetable broth instead of chicken broth for the vegetarian-minded.

Don't have time to shred the cabbage so
I had picked up a bag of cole slaw mix and saute with a small amount of olive oil and then top off with a very small amount of apple cider vinegar. It was great plain, the next day I had added 2 oz. of roasted chicken  and it was a wonderful lunch.  Another addition could be wide noodles. Since I am only serving
one person, I just add the amount that my
diabetic diet calls for.  Another good 
addition was sliced mushrooms saute with
the cabbage.  Good eating.  No chicken
broth, just the olive oil or a little amount of water to help it to steam faster.

This was a huge hit in our house and very easy to make, but it is more like steamed cabbage then fried. I served it with a pork roast.

This was about as simple as it gets and the broth adds excellent flavor. I kept my cabbage pieces a little bigger but other than that, there were no changes.

I couldn't fit my cabbage into the crock pot with the corned beef and potatoes... so I tried this recipe and it was great! I left out the butter and cooked it for only 30 minutes and it was perfectly savory and not soggy. My husband even ate it as leftovers, and he never eats leftovers!

This dish is wonderful.  I followed the recipe the first time and it was yummy.  The next time I threw in some onions and peppers... also great!

The other reviewers are right about this not being a fried cabbage recipe.... This is much like boiled cabbage but a rose by any other name is still a rose... This was good and I will make it again.

This was my first time making cabbage other than slaw and this recipe was pretty good. I did make some changes that were recommended by previous reviewers. I halved the amount of broth, sauteed some onion first before adding the broth, added a little natural bacon & the bacon drippings, and added a little natural sugar. I think next time I would leave out the broth completely and saute the cabbage in a little olive oil. Without the sugar and the bacon, I think the cabbage would have been a little bland. Otherwise this is a pretty good recipe and a good way for those not familiar with cabbage to be introduced to it as a side dish.

I also added diced up potatoes (raw) and onions.  I let the potatoes and onions cook a bit before adding the cabbage so it wouldn't overcook.  I used only a splash or two of broth and steam/fried the mixture in my wok.  The recipe is very hearty and economical.

I made this last night and it turned out great! The only difference that I did was I added a whole lot more butter spray (the no calorie, no fat kind), melted it, then cooked the cabbage in the butter for about ten minutes to soften it up. I then added the broth, sprinkled with salt and pepper, then let simmer on medium heat for about 15 minutes until tender. That cuts down on cooking time, and the end result was wonderful. I put a pinch of sugar in it when it was almost done cooking because I love sweet cabbage. Will definitely make again, but next time I'll add some bacon bits toward the end for the bacon flavor. Can be a delicious low fat, low calorie side!

I thought that this was a great way to cook cabbage - a great way to get my husband to love it also.  I used bacon grease (gasp!) initally with with chicken broth (and added butter at the end! - double gasp!) but it made for a vary tasty side dish, and if that is how I get my family to eat it, so be it!I would love to know what "true" fried cabbage is, since other reviewers said that it is not this same recipe. Any input?

Nothing unique or fancy, and certainly not fried. Just plain good. I used a tad less chicken broth and added some bacon grease along with the butter for additional flavor.  Gives plain old steamed/boiled cabbage a real lift!

Used very little butter and as suggested added a splash of red wine vinegar.  Will make whenever I have leftover cabbage.
Made a second time and added 1/2 an yellow onion and two shredded carrots. Yum!

My whole family loves this!  I don't use the broth and we haven't really noticed a difference.  I add the chopped cabbage to the butter in a skillet and sprinkle with sea salt.  Make sure you stir occasionally so that you don't burn your cabbage, if you do it right you should have some browned bits incorporated throughout.  Really tasty and slightly sweet.  Love it!

Why is this called fried? Taste is nice, but it is steamed/boiled not fried.  Too soupy for me; next time will maybe just use a couple of tablespoons of broth, and add onion for extra flavour.

Very good recipe.  Made exactly as stated and my husband loved it (even though he is used to southern style with bacon grease).  Next time I will try without the butter to see if it is as good-even lass fat!

I'll have to try this healthy version with broth. Growing up, my Dad used to fry up a couple slices of bacon, remove bacon.....then add sliced onions and coarsely chopped cabbage (green OR red) to bacon drippings.  Saute until golden....about 10 minutes. Salt & pepper....maybe a little onion powder.  If you want, you can re-add the bacon, crumbled.  As a kid, I CRAVED this on week-ends!  ;-)

Not crazy about cabbage but being a St.Paddy's day meal, I figured given the fact it was "Fried", that it would be better than steamed/boiled. When I noted in the recipe that it wasn't fried, I figured the chicken broth & butter combination would give it great flavour. When I cooked it up and tasted it, turned out to be the same as straight-up ho-hum boiled cabbage - not too impressed.

I changed this a bit ... melted 3 tablespoons of butter in saucepan, added 1 tablespoon brown sugar, added chopped cabbage, used 1/2 C. beef broth instead of chicken, salt & pepper to taste & simmered on low till cabbage was done, stirring to blend flavors.

I didn't use broth. I sauteed the cabbage and chopped onion in olive oil mixed w/a little butter, cooked over lower heat 'till cooked (longer then recipe.) I added a little smoked paprika for flavor. It's also yummy mixed with wide egg noodles and served as a main dish.

This was just OK in my opinion. The cabbage is much better if you just fry it in butter or butter flavored Crisco. Fry it until it gets browned for a real flavor treat.

I thought this needed a little extra flavor but it was a great base to start from. I followed the advice of other reviewers after it was all done and seasoned and added a little red wine vinegar for a little twang. Very nice, thanks for the recipe!

I cooked this because I ran out of room in my slow cooker for the cabbage in my corned beef and cabbage. So I thought I would try this. This is not really a fried cabbage. More like a sauteed cabbage. I used the broth from the slow cooker. I think there is way too much broth. Maybe somewhere around a 1/2 cup would allow it enough to steam but not be so soupy as mine was. And 45 minutes is way too long. I lifted the lid at 10 minutes and it was already pretty soft, but still had too much fluid. So I bumped up the heat to quickly reduce the broth. Which I liked, because it allowed the cabbage to start to brown a little bit. This has good flavor and I do like it better than if it were in the crock pot. I am just thinking the liquid and timing is off.

I love how easy it can be to make a delicious cabbage side dish! I added 1T olive oil to the butter and did not add chicken broth. Took about 20 minutes -- came out perfectly crisp tender and tasted sooo good! Thank you for sharing!

Great, simple recipe. I did cut the butter in half and added a little EVOO to make it even more healthy. Great side dish!

The recipe was ok as written however after adding some garlic and bacon, it was much better.  Then it is a 5 star recipe.

This is a very good recipe.  One of few that doesn't have bacon drippings. However I did add minced garlic and carrots for color.

I was just "surfing" recipes and happened on to this one, it instantly transported me down memory lane. My mother fixed this in various ways.   Your right, it is absolutely fabulous.  My favorite is made with smoked sausage.  I fix it pretty much as your instructions state, starting out with the diced smoked sausage, getting a little color on that than adding the diced onions and going from there.  If you haven't tried it with smoked sausage you are in for a wonderful taste treat. I don't know why, but it has been a couple of years since I have made this. Soooooo I am making a pit stop at the grocery store on my way home tonight, it has been long enough. Thanks so much for sharing.

'Totally agree with MSEATON ... First I added 2 tbs of butter AND olive oil, when the butter melted I added my shredded onion, carrots and cabbage at high heat until the onions and cabbage were a nice brown colour.  YUMMY!  It tastes ssoooo good with corned beef.  :o)

I agree, this is a winner evertime I make it!  This makes a great side dish to pork chops and DO add a splash of the red wine vinegar, it just gives it that extra flair needed.  (I have also used apple cider vingar as well)

mmmmmm. This is very good. I was skeptical at first b/c it smelled kind of bitter in the beginning, but after steaming for ~25 minutes it was perfect!  I added a whole onion, sliced thin, to the butter in the beginning.  Then I added the broth and a bit of madeira wine to boil, then added the cabbage.  It only needed 25 min to cook completely.

Very good, but mine got a little too soggy for my liking (operator error :), so I will watch it a little closer next time.  I did add caraway seeds halfway through the cooking time & a couple of splashes of balsamic vinegar at the end.

This was good. I added the splash of balsamic as someone recommended, and also a tea ball of caraway seeds which I think really adds an awesome background flavor to this recipe.

This was my first time to cook cabbage, and this recipe was easy to follow. I agree with the others that this is not "fried" but steamed cabbage. Next time I will use less broth for a crisper, more stir-fried taste/texture.

I agree that this isn't really fried cabbage, but it was still pretty good. I was in a bit of a hurry, so I finely shredded the cabbage, and let it cook/steam for about 20 mins. It was good, but I would probably add some sliced onion next time. Thanks!

This is steamed/boiled cabbage not fried cabbage. Cabbage makes its own broth as it cooks so adding chicken broth just makes it soggy not stir fried, but I have cooked it this way and its good also. Fried cabbage has no broth added. I usually put 3 tablespoons of olive oil or Low fat butter in a pan and some Mrs. Dash seasoning,But you can season to your taste.I have also cut up and pan fried some bacon and onions, keeping the grease in the pan and frying the cabbage flipping every few minutes until browned but still crunchy.   I am not knocking and recipe as far as cabbage goes you can't go wrong I have made it so many different ways.

Realized I was out of chicken broth so I nixed the butter too and just used chicken noodle soup instead (2 cans condensed soup +1 can water).  My kids loved the addition of the noodles and it was a super easy and tasty way to get them to eat cabbage.

I ranked this 4 just because I think it is more steamed than fried, but it is delishous.  I added in an onion, a few pepper corns and celery seeds, I also used chicken bouillion and cut the water in half.  I will make this again.  Thanks!

I used to eat cabbage as a kid at my grandparents. I got to eat the leftover cabbage that was boiled in water for stuffed cabbage. I used to love it with just a little butter and salt. I was looking for something similar, but wanted a tad more flavor without cooking it in bacon grease as some of the other recipes. This was perfect for what I was looking for today. I used a vegetable bouillion dissolved in water instead of canned broth. Only, thing is it takes some time to get the full head of cabbage to fit in the pot. I had to stir for the first 15 minutes to cook it down to fit the rest in. But, when done it still makes a good 1/2 pot full with one head of cabbage.

Best way to eat cabbage. For a little extra flavor, cut up an onion and throw it in with the cabbage when cooking!

Easy and quick to prepare but found it a bit watery so will decrease the chicken broth next time.  Other than that, it was delicious.

Super easy.  Really yummy.  I love that this recipe calls for chicken broth and not bacon grease.  What I also like about it is that all three of my kids, ages 5&under, also enjoyed this.  A definite regular in our home now, for sure.

I agree with some of the other reviews....This is definitely not "fried" cabbage (more like steamed) and one of the reasons for that is that there was too much liquid and to start with.  Thats not to say it wasn't good, cause it was, but if you're looking for "fried cabbage" look further!  Next time I'll use less than a can (maybe 1/3 can to start with) of broth.  Other than that, it was good.  4 stars b/c of the misleading name.

this was okay. THe chicken broth does add a nice flavor to the cabbage. It is alot healthier then frying it in bacon grease. I did strain the extra broth at the end and mix in some butter and salt and pepper.

Tasty and simple.  I also fried some bacon beforehand and cooked the cabbage in the same skillet.  Perfect as a St Pat's side dish, although I have a feeling I'll be making this again before next year!

I sauteed up a couple of slices of bacon (chopped) and onion before adding the cabbage, and omitted the butter. It was a fine side dish for corned beef.

So sweet, healthy and delicious!  I could eat this all day.  I, too, left out the butter and can't imagine that it would be more delicious with it added.  I used vegetable broth to make it part of our vegetarian St. Patrick's day dinner last night.  mmmm.....  I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch today!

This was great! Though... I don't think of it as fried. Used the broth, with a soy/dairy-free margarine and a little butter flavoring. Tasted good, took more like 20-30 minutes, though I only used about 1/2 a head of cabbage. Next time I might use a little less liquid, though I think it would taste good over rice. Will add carrots/onions next time and maybe try other variations.

I made the slow cooked corned beef from this sight and used the broth from it instead of the broth called for in this recipe. Also no butter because of the fat in the broth. Followed the rest of the recipe and we really liked it.

Made this to go with my St Patrick's Day dinner.  Very simple, quick side dish that I will make again.  Next time I'll add onions. Mine was done in about 20 min.  Yummy!!!  Served along side Beef and Irish Stout Stew and amazingly easy Irish soda bread, both from this site.  Terrific meal!!

My Asian style of doing this is heating sesame oil, omitting the chicken broth, using a clove or two of garlic, and adding soy sauce and a small amount of sugar.  Always turns out delicious!

I didn't really "fry" this, but the broth was great choice, rather than just water.  I cooked it in a pot for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.  I sprinkled a little garlic salt in - loved it!

I made my own spin on this recipe.  I used bacon grease instead of butter and I seasoned the cabbage with Old Bay Seasoning, which added a different kind of flavor.  Not to mentioned I added some shredded carrots too.  I have made this recipe twice and will make it again!!

I love fried cabbage but I was not true to this recipe but I'm sure it would have been just as good.  Instead of using chicken broth, I used water and added salt to taste.  Chicken broth can be too salty for me.  Cooking time was about 25 minutes.

This is a very good way to do cabbage.  The one change I make is to cook the cabbage in Onion Soup.  Delish.

Good recipe. I added cooked egg noodles (1/2 bag per head of cabbage), celery seed, ground pepper. I make this as a meal for my daughter and I for a meatless night.

I halved the recipe with the extra cabbage I had on St. Patrick's Day and used Soy Garden instead of butter to make it vegan.  I also added some shredded carrot, thick shreds, to give it a bit more color.  It was delicious and I can honestly say that I would add this to more than my St. Patrick's Day recipe box.

Some might find it bland, but I liked it. It needed a lot of salt to spice it up. I added a splash of red wine vinegar, per suggestions, and I thinked that helped with the flavor.

This cabbage really is Fabulous!!!! I used 1 stick of margarine and sautéed 1/2 of a yellow onion in it before following the recipe using a medium head of cabbage. Also I added a little cayenne pepper (just a little). It was great w/ Slow Cooked Corned Beef for Sandwiches and roasted potatoes.  I will make this again for Easter. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband went nuts over this recipe.  I added crumbled bacon as others have suggested.  I didn't have chicken broth so I had to use beef; I'll make sure I have chicken next time.  Hubby can't wait try with pork chops as someone suggested.

Funny thing! I had fried up bacon for breakfast this morning. I still have the drippings and four slices of bacon left. I had purchased packaged cole slaw mix, but did not want to make the homemade dressing. I will prepare this recipe tonight to serve with the ham I baked last night. I will let you know how we liked it. We love wilted greens anyway. Thanks. Freddy3

Right now this is the best that I can give this recipe because I wasn't able to try it as suggested; I didn't realize I was out of veggie chicken broth until after I had started making it so I had to opt for beef instead, but this one is REALLY good! I hope to be able to try it again with the given ingredients and then up it to a five-star.

This recipe was absolutesly delicious.  Added some sliced onion as one reviewer suggested, but it was so moist as tender.  My husband doesn't usually partake of cabbage, he actually ate it and liked it.  I'll be making this recipe again.

I think that if I'd grown up on this dish, I would have liked it more.  I thought it was just OK but hubby turned up his nose, so we probably won't make again.  I added a diced small onion and sprinkled with the red wine vinegar when done.

We like cabbage dishes. I made this and added  left over, cooked teriyaki pork chops which I cut to bite size pieces.  Wow. It added a very nice flavor. Any left over meat could work. I served as our main meal with texas garlic toast. I'll definitely make this again.

This was so easy and tasted great.  This also cut down on the amount of butter I've used in the past.  I did add some extra seasonings.  I can see this being one of the best ways to cook cabbage and will look forward to cooking it more often.

I've found that using beef broth instead of the chicken makes it even more flavorful. Best cabbage I've ever had.

I did leave the butter out as others suggested (only reason I gave it 3 stars- it is more of a 2 star recipe at best).  This was just bland.  I love cabbage and there are several 5 star cabbage recipes on this site.  I will not make this again.  It was easy and it cooked in under half the time stated.

It needed something!  I added red pepper flakes and then a dash of hot sauce.  All in all it was a great side dish.

Sooo good!  Used a half a head of cabbage as it makes a lot.  Only needed to cook for about 15 minutes.  Probably don't even need butter.  Added four small squeezes of ginger from the Gourmet Garden squeeze tube as well.  What a great easy vegetable side!

this fits all my criteria for a good dinner recipe.  It's quick, easy and nutritious.  The chicken broth really gives the cabbage good flavor.  I only cooked it for 20 min. and it was very tender.  You can customize with what ever spices you like.

This was a great side dish to our corned beef on St. Patrick's Day. I didn't have a chance to cook it the whole 45 mins. but it was great none-the-less. We loved the flavor the chicken broth added. I will be making this over and over again. It's easy and healthy.

As per other reviews, I omitted the butter.  But the cabbage never got sweet; I ended up adding a couple teaspoons of sugar at the end of the cooking process.

tried w/ red cabbage first.. Pretty good wish I'd had a little more crunch though.  Tossed some powdered sumac & ground parm cheese on before serving.

Delish!  I sauteed a small white onion in 3 tablespoon butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil, then added a coarsely chopped large head of cabbage and a cup of my homemade no-sodium chicken stock and 6 slices of diced, pre-cooked bacon.  I covered it and dcooked it on medium high and then added a generous grind of freshly cracked pepper and sea salt. Wonderful!

I made this for my family the other night and while I really enjoyed it, they were not impressed.  I found it to be slightly sweet and a little bit crunchy.  I used purple cabbage and it was really pretty too.  I guess I won't make it again though.  I can't eat that much cabbage by myself.

I made this the first time according to the recipe, but added 1 tablespoon of butter to the broth.  It turned out fabulous.  A batch for tonight's dinner is cooking on the stove as I write this.  Very close to the recipe of a nearby Amish smorgasbord!

This was really good. Simple to make. I might actually use a little less butter next time - it tasted really buttery, but we liked it. I'm new to cooking with cabbage so it's a good start.

Excellent flavored recipe.
However, Keep an extra can of chicken broth on hand in case one can is not enough.
Mine cooked up fast.  Other than that, Yum Yum.

So, I bought an in house pre made salad (large) at our local grocery store to divide up into 5 small salads for the week.  I didnt know what to do with the left over cabbage (kale mix) and came across this recipe.  Ingredients on hand, this was made in a cinch and was tasty (like the inside of an amazing eggroll). Best part is that I have dinner for 2 nights this week along with the salad! So easy.

First time I made this it was good as is, but seemed to be a bit plain.  Second time I made this, I added 1 tablespoon sherry to chicken broth,   After broth cooked away, I added 1tsp each of caraway and celery seed and blended.  Then, I turned cabbage into a large skillet with a little oil and caramelized it a little.  I found my additions made a good recipe better--heartier and more robust  flavor.

this was really a good recipe. I use this for the Cabbage when I did the Irish egg rolls for St Patrick's Day. to make sure you stir it off and when it gets toward completion, otherwise it'll stick to the pan.

I make this all the time. This recipe calls for way to much broth to get fried cabbage. This makes stewed cabbage. A big difference. 
"Fried" cabbage is exactly as the name suggests. The cabbage is fried in an oil of one sort or another. Usually bacon grease or butter.  
My personal favorite stewed cabbage is a combination of matchstick carrots, sliced onions, chopped cabbage and mushrooms. Saute the carrots and onion in butter, add cabbage, mushrooms and broth. Simmer until cabbage is slightly translucent. Season in the last few minutes of cooking.

I would cut the cabbage in larger slices next time, maybe shingle style instead of julienned. Very delicious, served with Smoked pork loin, mac n' cheese and Baked Zucchini Chips from this site.  I read this is supposed to be an Irish dish, but I worked well with our Southern meal.

Made this recipe exactly as written.  I love cabbage but this cabbage tasted very bland and overcooked.  Will not make it again but I would suggest to anyone that tries this recipe, watch the cooking time!  It's too long and maybe add additional spices to perk it up.

This is sooooo gooood! My family doesn't like fried cabbage, but I do so I cut the recipe down.  It's a comfort food for me. I usually will fry up the cabbage in the butter and then add the broth, though. Yum!

Tired of the typical boiled ham and cabbage, I thought I would saute the cabbage.  Diced a small onion and knife shredded the cabbage.  Put two TBLS. of butter in a non-stick wok, added the onion and sauteed for two minutes.  Added two cups of the water the ham was boiled in (instead of the chicken stock) and brought that up to a boil.  In went the cabbage and cooked on low (covered) for approximately 15 minutes (stirring occasionally), added two TBLS. of apple cider vinegar, salt and pepper.  Continued to slow cook for ten minutes.  Perfect!  Planning on doing this every year for St. Patrick's Day.

We use homemade celery salt with pepper as the seasoning but otherwise make this same dish with the addition of a thinly sliced onion and only steam covered in the skillet for about 30 minutes.
