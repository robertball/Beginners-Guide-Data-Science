Great flavor. Go well with the Best Black Bean recipe from this site. Didn't have a packet of taco seasoning so used recipe below. We only used 1 can of corn too as I usually don't like corn. Not this time. Measured burgers using 1/4 cup so burgers would cook evenly. Made 5 fat burgers. We only had small tortillas so cut burgers in half and they rolled up nicely. Make sure you top tortilla with the baked salsa  as well as the sour cream and lettuce. The combo makes the meal. Thanks for this keeper recipe.


Taco Seasoning

1 tablespoon chili powder 
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder 
1/4 teaspoon onion powder 
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes 
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano 
1/2 teaspoon paprika 
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin 
1 teaspoon sea salt 
1 teaspoon black pepper Store in an airtight container.

These burgers were amazing I used the self made taco seasoning some posted in one of the reviews and it was great!!!! I did not use the bread crumbs and I did grill them. To keep them from falling apart I put them on wax paper and put in the freezer till just partial frozen and then sprayed grill and they came out perfect.

Good but not great.  They were tasty, but fairly time consuming, and since time short in our house, I probably won't make again. Also, I am spoiled by the fabulous Ina Garten turkey meatloaf recipe....no other ground turkey recipe can compare to hers!

These were delicious!  The turkey meat is a great substitute for beef - not as fatty tasting.  Next time I make it though, I would just mix everything together like a taco instead of shaping them into burgers because it all falls apart anyway.

Delicious. I had no problem with burgers falling apart and I followed rec to the T. We ate them with tomato corn salad, did not use tortillas. Will make again and again.

These are some very tasty burgers!  A nice change from the same-old, same-old.  The mix is a little on the sticky side so make sure you grease your hands before forming the patties.  My family really enjoyed these!

I made this for my family one night and everyone loved it! It was delicious. I uasually don't like corn with mexican food, but for this recipe I really enjoyed the flavor it added overall. Although some other reviews say it came out mushy, I pretty much followed the directions exactly and found that it was just moist enough. For a little more flavor and heat I put out green tabasco sauce and I also served it with avocado. It was great! We will surely be having this again.

I just added some cheese and barbecue sauce and this was a very good meal. Also to anyone who was having trouble with it falling apart just next time put like a teaspoon of water in the mixture and use wax paper when preparing them. I would also wrap them in the wax paper in stick the patties in the freezer for a couple of minutes this always make mine stick.

This is a delicious recipe.  I added 1 cup of black beans to the recipe for protein and fiber.  I topped with fat free shredded cheddar and 99% fat free ground turkey breast.  I topped with avocado slices, sour cream, and homemade salsa.  I'm not sure where this recipe gets its nutrition figures though - by my calculations, with the fat free ground turkey breast, this recipe should make about 10 patties at less than 150 calories each.

These were so good! I even had on of my neighbors ask if she could have one, LOL! They were kind of messy...they ended up almost falling apart while I was grilling so be careful there...Nice change up from your typical cow burger :)

This was a good recipe.  The taco seasoning can be quite pronounced and overpower the meat.  We decreased taco seasoning by half, added 3 diced jalapeno peppers to the onion/gr pepper mixture and extra 2tblsp of salsa to the meat.  We seared the burgs on both sides in a hot pan prior to placing them in the oven and then cut oven time down by 5-7mins.  They turned out very nice and juicy.  Good on their own or in buns/tortilla's.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated. In the end it tasted exactly like a taco. I would have much rather have made tacos, which would have taken a lot less time. Will not be making again.

Family loved this burger. Made a few changes ....used extra lean ground chicken instead of turkey ...made taco seasoning instead of pre-packaged...used 1c of frozen corn, 1/2c of salsa and had to use more bread crumbs to bind. Served with thick sliced ripe tomatoes,  light ranch dressing, and sharp American cheese.  Thanks!

The flavor was pretty good on these but the patties were small.  It was kind of awkward trying to eat them.

So Yummy! The flavors are great, and they are quick & very easy to make. Made these when my daughter had a friend over, they both scarfed them down and went back for more! My only complaint is that since we had these my daughter will not eat corn unless I mix in some salsa! :)

The flavor of these was EXCELLENT. The only problem was I had a hard time getting them not to crack. If I make these again I will definitely take the advice of another person who rated this recipe and try to freeze the patties first.

This was an awesome recipe, an unexpected variation. I had to make this twice because this was the first time I ever made something from scratch. I didn't realize that there was a difference between the head and cloves of garlic. I did leave out the sour cream though, I'm not a big fan. I also used Italian breadcrumbs, just to throw in another culture. Mine came out very soft and huge, I could have made a lot more than 6.

These were very good!  I used red pepper instead of green and didn't top with the remaining corn.  I'll just buy a smaller can of corn next time and use that.  Dipping the burgers in the bread crumbs helped hold them together, so I had no problems with mine crumbling, although we did break them apart in the tortillas once they were done!  I also made my own "taco seasoning" from the recipe left by another viewer below.  I don't like the packaged stuff.  I was very surprised at how delicious this was!

I loved this recipe! It wasn't as spicy as some mexican food but I can see how you could spice it up for those who prefer more.  I myself loved it because it wasn't too spicy. I will just serve on a bed of lettuce next time as I have cut out wheat except on occasion.  

Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

So much better than the usual turkey burger.  A great, healthy meal.  I just served them on buns with pepper jack cheese.

These were good, but not great.  I thought they could use a LOT more spices, but I do like spicy food.  I found them a bit soggy--maybe I should have added a few more breadcrumbs.  Still, they weren't bad.

I skipped the bread crumbs step and cooked these on the grill.  Oh wow!  what a great flavor!  I only used half a packet of taco seasoning as my husband cannot eat really spicey food and after I wrapped them in the tortilla shell, I grilled them to give it a crispy shell.  I never told my husband it was ground turkey (he wouldn't have eaten it otherwise) and he never suspected a thing!  In the words of my husband...."HONEY  THESE ARE DELICIOUS"!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Pretty awful. Husband would not eat them. Four stars for something different, but these just did not translate for me. We'll stick to chili when it comes to substituting ground turkey for beef.

I am a terrible cook...but I love trying!  This recipe was so easy and it tasted like I spent all day on it.  We love Mexican food and this is a keeper.  I did find that cutting the patties in half and putting two in each tortilla worked out better than keeping the burgers whole.  They were yummy with green tobasco too!

These were delicious! I did not find them to be a lot of work to put together and I had no trouble with my burgers falling apart.  I used a salsa that was half puree and half chunky and made my burgers a few hours ahead of time and put them in the fridge to firm up.  I served them with chips, salsa and the Mexican Rice Pilaf recipe from this site.  This is a keeper!

Delicious, filling, and healthy!  Followed the directions to a T, and turned out perfectly.  Made the following "healthier" modifications: turkey breast (99% fat free), low sodium taco seasoning and corn, whole grain bread crumbs, and whole wheat tortillas.  We did not use sour cream, but I think I will probably use some FF sour cream next time.

Pretty good but I suggest decreasing the corn because the burgers tend to fall apart. It is hard to make a juicy turkey burger but almost everyone really liked these...next time I will add a slice of pepperjack cheese on top for extra flavor.

Yum Yum, I used beef, so I can't review this as it was written. With that said, the flavor was great and I can imagine it would be good with Turkey too. I just didn't have any and didn't feel like going to the store.

These are wonderful broken up into the soft tortillas.  Add a little fat free cheese and sour cream and these taste too good to be turkey!  Somehow baking them in the breadcrumbs really makes a difference.  I used lean ground turkey breast and very little olive oil in the pan.  These are very good.

I just didn't like these. Perhaps if I had left off the bread crumbs and grilled them, as suggested by another reviewer. My husband liked them, (he would say 3 stars, I would say 1), but said he would have preferred a bun, rather than the tortilla. I added a bit of shredded cheese for the last minute of cooking.

Delicious and so different from usual hamburgers.  Even my granddaughter enjoyed them.  My son-in-law was the only one who ate them with the tortilla.  We enjoyed them by themselves.

This was excellent!  I forgot to pick up breadcrumbs, so instead I smashed a bunch of tortilla chips and shook the crumbs with some crushed red chilies.  I can't say if that effected the flavor of your recipe, but it was delicious!  Thanks!

Loved it! My husband told me this goes on his favorite dishes list. My only suggestion is to make sure you use the "burrito size" tortillas if you want to be able to wrap and pick it up. We used the "soft taco" size and ended up eating it open faced with a fork and knife. Kept it from being too messy -- depends how you want to eat it.

We loved this recipe!  Absolutely delicious and so easy to make.  I used the Taco Seasoning recipe available here on allrecipes which makes 1 oz and was the perfect amount of seasoning.  I also ate it without the Tortilla to keep it lower glycemic.  The rest I followed the instructions but did use a little more bread crumbs.  Make sure to press the burgers into the bread crumbs which helps make them stick together and easier to flip and coat the other side with bread crumbs.  If your serving to children you may want to eliminate the red pepper flakes from the taco seasoning or split your turkey meat in half and make half for the kids and half for the adults.  We will be making this a regular in our household.  Thank you for sharing.

These were good.  My 5 y.o. does not eat veggies, so I have to hide everything when cooking.  I skipped the onion and green pepper since the salsa had those in there and pureed that with the corn and added several tbsp. of that mixture along with several tbsp. of refried beans to the ground turkey and then made the patties.  I also used only 3/4 of the taco seasoning in the mix and added the rest to the bread crumbs.  I used a little olive oil and pan fried them for several minutes on each side and finished them in the oven.  We all enjoyed them.

I loved this recipe! It hasn't been reviewed in a while, so thought I'd refresh the comments for anyone who might be thinking about trying this recipe. I followed the instructions as written and thoroughly enjoyed the way it turned out. No problem with the burgers falling apart. My kids, 13 and 16, loved this dinner! I will certainly make this again.

Pretty good and tasty too.  I thought the meat mix was very moist, but they cooked up ok. I think next time I'd just fry up the turkey mix though.  Not sure it is worth all of the work to make the burger. They crisped nicely with the breadcrumbs on the first side, but then sat in the fat, and had salsa poured on them, so they lost their crispiness - in other words, I'm not sure the breadcrumb step was worth the time.  The flavor was good though.

Love them, I did everything as suggested but cooked them 20 minutes each side instead of 10.  I also added Shredded Cheddar Cheese on top before the sour cream and it melted perfectly.  These were a hit!  A great way to hid vegetables the family needs by putting them in the meat!  Thanks!

It was great.  Again, my whole family loved it.  But instead of making the turkey burgers I just had my dad buy them pre-made, it saved a little bit of time.  All I did was put the taco seasoning on them and cooked them just as the directions said.  Then put the salsa and corn on top.  Personally, i didn't like the taste of the corn but it was still good and we got the vegetables needed.  Also, I totally forgot to spray the pans before cooking the burgers.  It turns out they were just fine without the cooking spray.

Very tasty!  I do wish I would've added some cheese, though; and I will next time.  Also, husband doesn't like sour cream so I used ranch dressing instead.  I ended up eating mine without the tortilla and I actually think these would do well on a whole wheat hamburger bun.  Will make again!

I really likes the corn/salsa idea but the the taco seasoning was way to overpowering. That is all i tasted. Overall it was good but next time i will season the meat differently.

I love this recipe.  Made it a few times so far.  The only thing I changed was that I microwaved the cut up onion in a little bit of water before adding it to the meat.   Great diet meal on a piece of 45 calorie bread with a piece of avocado and a side salad.  Yummy!

This recipe received mixed reviews. I wasn't all that fond of it, but my fiance really liked it. The flavor was good, but my complaint was the texture and size of the burgers. I wish I would have made smaller patties as there was just too much meat for me. We did like how the patties had a nice crispy outside. Thanks :)

Great recipe! These burgers are so moist and flavourful.  

I made these in the evening for lunch the following day. I did not add the corn salsa mixture 1/2 way through the bake time. Instead, I heated it up as a topping for the burgers. I loved the wrap - so much better than a bun!

Also...instead of using a store bought taco seasoning pack I used the recipe "Taco Seasoning I" from this site. Excellent flavour!

It was ok. Way too much prep time for not enough of an original and delicious recipe. On the plus side, I did learn how to make a burger without a grill.

Very good. I loved it. I added corn and black beans to the salsa before I mised it in. I did freeze for a little while before I put them on the grill.  Good recipe.

There is no binding agent to hold these burgers together.  As such, they basically turned into flavored burger crumbles in a pan when I went to turn them.  No one in my family found them tasty in the least.  Maybe we just have weird palates, but they were met with a resounding yuck.

I have made this recipe twice now and my family loves it. It's a little akward to eat if you make the patties too big. I crumble it up like taco meat for my youngest.

I loved these burgers. We ate them just as patties and glad we did.  The tortilla and condiments would have taken away from the great flavor. I didn't use the corn because I was serving corn-on-the cob, but I did add the 2T of salsa to the mixture.  I didn't use the bread crumbs either.  I also added a large handful of Jack cheese.  These are awesome and so are the leftovers.

This has a great combination of flavor, and definitely different.  My boyfriend didn't seem to confident about the meal idea, but raved over it once he ate one, and then two .. and a half.  I though the corn was a bit messy and will omit that in the future.  Thank you!

I used 1/2 can of black beans instead of corn.  I also used burrito seasoning because I did not have taco seasoning.  I also used a red pepper instead of a green pepper.
These were really good and my husband enjoyed them!

I just made these for dinner. I didn't have bell pepper so I used an anaheim chile. I used half a can of corn as other cooks suggested. I didn't have taco seasoning, but I had a packet of fajita mix. Turned out delicious!  
Daniel,thanks for sharing such a brilliant idea!

This was awesome and easy! A nice change from using ground meat and they are loaded with flavor.  I didn't care for the appearance of the patty so I broke mine up before serving on a tortilla. I only made half the recipe and it made 6 patties...which served 8 tortillas broken up. Will definetly make again.

Fabulous!  Definitely not another boring old burger!  I followed the recipe exactly except I made the burgers oblong and smaller because I had smaller tortillas.  Also, we didn't have sour cream and they were delicious anyway but I can see how the coolness of the sour cream would be great!

YUM, YUM, YUM!!  Made this last night without the tortillas (just set the burger on a bed of romaine) and hubby snarfed up two of them.  full of flavor, although next time i might use a little less taco seasoning (3/4 instead of a whole packet).  Definitely saving this one for the future.

The first time I made these I followed the directions exactly and loved them.  The second time I thought I would use tofu crumbled up instead of turkey.  It tastes really good but the burgers would not stay together so it was more like loose taco meat.  Either way I love this recipe.

Tasty. Would have been better if my oven cooked evenly and hadn't left one burger undone in the middle, but hey! I scaled the recipe to 4 servings since I had an extra half a package of ground turkey (approx. 10 oz.) to use. For the corn, I used a can of niblets (10 oz? again?) and it was a little bit too much. I didn't have any lettuce and my tortillas were a little too small for good wrapping, but overall, I liked this a lot.

An great use for ground turkey.  Most turkey burgers get a little too stiff - this was moist.  I substituted black beans for corn because of an allergy and put some in the burgers as well.  I think it would be great with both though.

These were totally delicious and a nice change from the same old hamburger or turkey burger. This will definitely be a go to meal in my house!

Hubby and I really liked these however using the "homemade" taco seasoning (didn't have a package on hand) that was given by another reviewer made them a bit spicy for my children.  Next time I will use the packaged seasoning to see if that tones it down a little.

I did not like this recipe. It sounded delicious, so I thought I'd give it a try. Surprisingly lacking in flavor and not easy to eat.  Thumbs down.

This is so good!  The flavor and texture is wonderful, and it is definitely unique.  My Mexican roommates love it.  I'm lazy, so I chop up the veggies in the food processor, add a can of corn and another of black beans (drain and rinse), about half the salsa, mix and chill overnight.  Then I scoop out the patties into oblong shapes and bake.  When they are done, heat up tortillas, add lettuce, a burger, salsa and some sour cream and it's good eating!  Thanks for posting this.

Excellent, excellent, excellent!  We loved these!  Full of flavor...messy to eat, but who cares?  Hubby said, "You can make these again!"  Our kids loved them too!  Thanks for a delicious addition to my recipe box!

I completely forgot to pick up the onion and bell pepper, but I made these anyway and they were pretty good!  I didn't really like the breading, though.  Next time, I will sprinkle them with a little cheese.

This came out really good.  I made it with over fries (a recipe I got from this website too).  The salsa I bought thou was Mexican salsa and it had a little mild spice.  The came it a great flavor.

These were fantastic!  I doubled the chopped garlic because we love our garlic and used garlic/lime salsa.  Also mixed all the corn in the salsa rather than serving some of the corn on top.  My husband, who hates ground turkey, LOVED these turkey burgers!  We will definitely make these again!

I made these last night and while I thought they were good and my brother thought they were good but my son didn't care for them at all.  I am going to try the recipe again just change it up a little.  The sour cream really made them though!

Couldn't find any ground turkey - had to use ground beef medium. Came out fantastic!!!!! Great - almost sweet taste. A little crumbly but not a major problem. Alot of dishes/pots/pans to clean up but well worth it.
Among the best burgers I've had. HIHLY rcommended - even with ground beef.

we liked this a lot. i had to make substitutions because i decided last minute to make it and didn't have all the ingredients. didn't have turkey so i used half ground beef and half ground buffalo. didn't have corn but used mixed vegetables, blenderized them a bit due to the large green beans. didn't have sour cream but topped with avocado. and, after all that, it was great. see, two recipes here for the price of one!

We really liked these very flavorful Mexican burgers. Definitely serve them on wraps as the recipe indicates because the texture is too crumbly for a bun - it was a little challenging keeping them together, so I found them a little messy but definitely worth it! We happen to like corn so I used the whole 15 oz can which gives you extra to put on the wrap, but you could either cut that in half or eliminate it entirely. Also I chose to use flavored tortillas (jalapeno/cilantro) instead of plain flour ones for extra kick.

Very easy to make.  I think my salsa was too runny as the burgers were too mushy.  I melted cheese on top of the salsa for a nice presentation.  Although these were good I won't be making them again.  I think the recipe needs a little fine tuning, the taco seasoning is just too much.
