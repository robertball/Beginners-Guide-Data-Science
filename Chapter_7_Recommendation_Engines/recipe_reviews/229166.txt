Very good and good for you too! It's hard to get my husband to eat veggies, but when they're grilled he really enjoys them.  I opted to add some fresh garlic and a couple of splashes of lemon juice.  I also opted out of adding the pinepple as I wasn't sure how that would taste with basil and oregano. Great accompaniment to grilled chicken!

We enjoyed this one.  I did add garlic powder and white balsamic vinegar.  Rather than basting while cooking I tossed the veggies with the sauce mixture and allowed them to sit in the fridge for a couple of hours before grilling, worked perfectly.

Great basic recipe and instructions.  Unfortunaltely not a true review of the original recipe as I do not like pineapple at all - but used all other vegetables. Second time I followed another reviewers suggestions of pre-cutting vegetables, adding balsamic vinegar and 1 clove fresh minced garlic to the dressing ingredients, tossed  to coat and let sit before putting on skewers to cook.  Amazing yet subtle flavours this way.

My whole family ate their vegetables for the First.  Time.  Ever.  Even my husband.  Even my 3 veggie adverse boys.  My husband even asked me to make again.  Revisions I made: coated the veggies in olive oil and salt only.  Skewered each veggie on  their own skewer.  (Mushrooms on one skewer, peppers  on their own skewer.  Etc...)  then basted every five minutes with the olive oil marinade for about 20 minutes.  Success!  Thank you!  Served with steak.

I added balsamic and garlic powder as others suggested. I wish I had tossed the veggies in the mixture ahead of time as other reviewers did. I will try that next time. But it was well received by our guests and tasted very good! I will make it again.

Left out the squash, pineapple, red onion, and half the salt. Very delicious recipe. I will be making it again. Next time I think I will add some garlic to the mixture and perhaps some rosemary.

I made these skewers with my dad on a Sunday grill out and they were spectacular! I tweaked and added some of my own twists to it though. Taking heed to the other reviews, I added garlic and balsamic vinegar. In addition to that, I added pineapple juice to the sauce as well! Canned pineapple works as a fine substitute by the way. Everyone at the table ate at least two skewers, including my picky little brothers. I deducted a star because even though this recipe was good, it was better with the input of other reviews.

I really liked the veggies, however the seasoning was not that great. I cooked mine in the oven at 400 F for 12 minutes. Probably needed 5 more minutes.

Easy peasy.....best way to get kids to eat anything is to put it on a stick!  Perfect combo of flavors for the grown folk, too.  This will be a summer staple.

Huge hit with the husband.  I'm not a big cooked veggie eater, but even I found them to be pretty good! Followed a couple other reviews, only as far as tossing the veggies in the marinade prior to grilling.  Very pretty and turned out great!

Takes longer than I expected to prep, but worth it. I'll experiment with different ingredients and ratios... ended up with a lot of extra mushrooms, would like less squash/zuchini and more tomatoes, peppers. Remember to soak the skewers for awhile before grilling!

Easy, delicious.  I put them in the refrigerator as well.  Can't go wrong with this and you can obviously just mix this up with whatever veggies you want to cook

These were delicious. I used the marinade as written with onion, zucchini, baby bell mushrooms and colored peppers. Delish!

Very good!   I omitted the pineapple and did as others suggested and tossed all the remaining  ingredients together in a bowl and let it sit in the fridge until it was time to grill.
