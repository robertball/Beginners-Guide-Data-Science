I noticed one reviewer decided not to use mushrooms in the future, as they "add nothing".  I disagree.  Mushrooms are low carb and low in calories, but they are high in riboflavin (headache relief and boosts the body’s antioxidants level), fiber and niacin (vitamin B3).  Plus, they just taste fabulous.  Great healthy recipe!

Snow peas are one of my favorite veggys. I made two changes to this recipe. First I used butter instead of olive oil 'cause I don't care for olive oil and second I added a few chopped up green onions.  It's a great side dish when you want something different.

This was pretty good, but I added bean sprouts, baby corn ears, and upped the amount of teriyaki sauce.  I served it at a dinner party and everyone loved it that way!

I've used this recipe for years and love it just the way it is. I would love to know why it is when someone posts a recipe after some of you get done with it the recipe is no longer recognizable. Things like I left out the mushrooms and changed the snow peas to corn and carrots!!! You are aware that it is no longer the same recipe?! Try the recipes as they are and give an opinion that something could have been changed. But to completely obliterate the recipe before you even tried it as is would drive me crazy if I posted a recipe on here.

This was delicious.  I used sugar snap peas instead of the snow peas only because I had a bag of them that needed to be used.  It came out great.  I did add a smidgen of garlic paste to the peas and mushrooms while they were cooking.  Yum!

Wonderful flavor. I made a couple of changes.  Hubby doesn't care for mushrooms so I rarely have them on hand.  I substituted one fresh ear of cut corn and about 1 cup of cooked diced carrots that I had left over.  I cooked the corn in the oil for about 3 minutes and then added peas until just wilted and carrots last until heated thru.  I didn't have Teraki sauce so I used 1 generous tablespoon of soy.  Seasame seeds added a nice touch.  I think the recipe can easily stand as given, my changes were just necessary due to my pantry.  Great versatile recipe Bonnie.  Thanks for sharing.

Solid side dish recipe with sugar or snap peas working equally well. Flavor changers for those that like to mix it up:  Try oyster sauce vs teriyaki from time to time. Same dish with an altogether different taste. Served with Steamed Fish with Ginger also from AR. Nice dinner for those watching weight.  Thank you Bdeger for the recipe.

This was really good, but purchased teriyaki sauce can be a bit too thick and rich, overwhelming the poor mushrooms.  Try with a mix of soy sauce, sake and mirin (sweet sake) istead.

We enjoyed this. I had a bottle of toasted sesame seeds on hand so I skipped step one and proceeded from there. Super easy and fast recipe that is very tasty. I used 3 Tbs of teriyaki sauce and that was perfect for us. We will make this again and again. Thanks for sharing!

So good!  I cooked the snow peas and mushrooms in sesame oil.  I also added 2 sliced garlic cloves.  I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes.  Didn't have terryaki sauce, so I used soy sauce and about 1 T. of brown sugar.  I will make this again for sure!  I'm also thinking about adding some fresh ginger.

Easy, simple, wonderful recipe.  Toasting the sesame made the flavors stand out so much more.  I recommend using another oil rather than olive oil, since cooking olive oil at high temperature creates toxicity.  I used canola.  Beware of overcooking the snow peas.  Following the recipe, the snow pears were crunchy and contrasted nicely with the mushrooms!  I used leftover dumpling sauce instead of teriyaki and the taste was perfect.  5 stars!

This was great but when I prepared it I was in a hurry so I sautéed the sesame seeds and some minced garlic in an olive oil butter combo for a minute then added the veggies. I used the more mild oyster sauce instead and it was fantastic!

I loved this idea but had to make a few alterations. I only had snap peas so I used those instead. I used butter instead of oil and cooked minced garlic and onion and added the mushrooms/peas to that. I had no teriyaki sauce but added brown sugar to soy sauce and added a little cornstarch to thicken it. cooked the sauce till thick and YUMMY.

I used green beans, canned shitakes and baby corn, because that's what I had on hand, and it was awesome!  I will make this again and again with whatever veggies sound good at the time.  Thanks for the recipe!

I guess this was okay - I made it exactly as written. Fresh vegetables are good, but the sauce was a little blah and mainly just collected in the bottom of the bowl. Nothing special, really, in my opinion.

I made this without the teriyaki sauce to elminate sodium and it was still wonderful. The mushrooms and peas pair well together.

This was fantastic! Even I, the self declared mushroom hater [I sliced them very thin, to help ;) ] adored this!! My husband and my three young children wolfed the dish down, and I've already added it to my personal recipe book- a sign of a sure winner.

Follow it exactly and it will be fabulous! Mushrooms MAKE this dish, do NOT exclude!!


The sesame seeds took quite awhile for me to brown- it took quite a high heat at the end, as at over 12 mins on med they weren't browning yet.

This was very good and the sesame seeds really add to the flavor.  I think you could probably get by with half the amount of teriyaki sauce.  It just turned to liquid and I ended up draining off most of it before serving.

Kristin7 Olive oil is not any more toxic than any other oil except coconut oil which has a higher oxidation temperature. That being said, I don't have any sesame seeds but cook it with snow peas and portobella mushrooms. I then add some steak to it to make it a main dish. Very tasty!

I used this recipe for fresh green beans replacing the snow peas, and it was delicious. My husband said it was better than our favorite Chinese Restaurant.

Delicious!!!! I upped the teriyaki sauce to 3 tablespoons and added about an 1/8 teaspoon of pepper and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Gave it a bit more flavor since some of the reviewers thought it was bland. Oh, and I also added about a 1/2 cup of pineapple, it went well with the teriyaki. I served this as a side dish with grilled steaks. Yummy!

yum. wonderful when paired with some brown rice n' fish. I also modified the recipe: I used portobello mushrooms with the snow peas, but didn't have teriyaki sauce, so I used oyster sauce with a dash of soy sauce instead. I also threw in some rehydrated sliced shiitake mushrooms I had. Tasted great!.

Made this tonight - excellent! Although recipe stood it's ground as posted, of course, I didn't have all ingredients, so improvised. Used mushrooms, snow peas,and water chestnuts stir fried in butter and a bit of olive oil, garlic powder, few hot pepper flakes, salt and pepper.  The taste was awesome and it was so fast and easy! I will make again. Might even add some other ingredients then.

Didn't have any mushrooms on me so I julienned some carrots and added 2 cans of cut baby corn.  Used the teriyaki sauce from the Baked Teriyaki recipe (also from this site).  Yum!

Delicious and easy.  I added some red pepper flakes and extra firm tofu to make it a meal. Add the tofu two minutes before the veggies to brown it a little.

Great way to cook snow peas. You don't even need the sauce just mix it with the Orange-Ginger Tofu Triangles found on this site and some jasmine rice.

Very very good! My husband and brother said it was better than a chinese restaurant. I didn't have sesame seeds, so instead substituted the olive oil for a sesame/soybean oil blend... Was Amazing!
