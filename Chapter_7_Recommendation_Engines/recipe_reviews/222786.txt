I was seeking something like the Chutney I'm accustomed to and this is not it. This is indeed a "sweet" Chutney rather than the infinitely more delicious spicy Chutney I would gladly die for. Having said that, if you cook this with your eggs, along with a cut up mushroom, you are in business for breakfast.
