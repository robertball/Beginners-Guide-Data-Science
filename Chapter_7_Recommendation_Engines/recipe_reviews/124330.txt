Wow - this was a delicious fall breakfast treat! I prefer more of a streusel-like topping, so I added 2 T. of MELTED BUTTER to the nut mix & used 1/2 cup of BROWN sugar. I followed the rest of the recipe, but used 2 apples in the center instead of one. It was even better when fully cooled. Thank you, we will enjoy this recipe often!

All I can say is....Oh my stars.  This cake was light and fluffy and VERY moist.  I am not sure how the few reviewers that gave critical reviews ended up with a dry cake.  My only alteration for the next time around is adding more apples.  It is a WONDERFUL recipe.  Thank your grandma for sharing!!  Blessings.

Despite the fact this uses only 2 eggs... it is so light and fluffy! (maybe it's b/c I beat the margarine + eggs + sugar longer than required) I used brown sugar for the filling + topping. but I think 1/2 a cup was too much, since the sugar on top doesn't really melt in the oven. (update) It's okay to cut down on the sugar in this recipe, it's not really noticeable when you do. Be creative and try other fillings as well!

Supermoist and tasty.  I grated one apple directly into the batter. Delicious.

This cake came out beautiful.  It held it's shape well and was a pleasure to cut and eat.  I made it to the recipe, except I used oatmeal instead of walnuts and 1/2 cup of brown sugar for the topping and 1/2 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar in the batter. Oh and after spreading the bottom half and putting on the apples and 1/2 the topping, I added 1 Tablespoon of milk to the batter to help spread it easily. I also did not have a tubed spring form, so put it in a round spring form, and after 40 minutes of baking, I shut off the oven and kept it in for 15 minutes more.  The color was perfect and it cooked through nicely.

This was delicious!! Made it for a group of friends, everyone loved it. I used 2 apples instead of one. Also, don't have a spring form tube pan, so I used my spring form cheesecake pan. It worked just fine.

This was easy and delicious!! I made it a "healthier" way by substituting the sour cream with plain low-fat yogurt and decreased the amount of sugar used. My guests raved over it!

I loved this coffee cake!  This was very moist, so, I don't understand how another baker's comment said that this was dry.  I did, however, have 2 apples that I needed to use up, so I used 2 instead of 1 apple.  I would definitely make this again!

This was good, although I had to bake it longer because I used a springform pan. I chopped the apples up, and added dried cherries, coconut and slivered almonds (photos #2 and #3). I used less sugar because the coconut was already sweetened, and used mostly brown sugar.

I made this x-mas eve to eat in the morning while opening presents...wow, it didn't disappoint! Very good flavor, moist, and the apples are a great addition. I followed the recipe exactly except that I didn't have a tube pan. I used a 9 inch cheesecake pan it it turned out great, a little hard to spread the batter and I didn't exactly have enought to do a complete 2nd layer but it didn't seem to matter. It all puffed up wonderfully. Oh, I did use brown sugar for the topping, delish!

Great hit! I didn't have sour cream so I substituted yougurt and milk. I didn't have nuts either, but the sugar on top gave it a good crusty edge.

So I started making this wonderful cake and discovered that I didn't' have 2 eggs! Instead for one of the eggs (though I suppose this could be for both) I used 2 Tbsp flour, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, and 2 Tbsp apple sauce. THEN I realized that I only had 1/2 cup sour cream!!! So for the other half cup I used 1 Tbsp vinegar and the rest of the half cup heavy cream. In the end this turned out UNBELIEVABLY tasty! Everyone at work asked for the recipe!  One thing I will do next time though is to increase the # of apples and nuts!!

Would've made my dearly departed Nan proud with this one! Made this last night with a few changes. First, I made it in a bundt pan... just made it upside down so the yummy nut mixture was on top when the cake was turned out. Took another few reviewers' suggestions and used half brown sugar, half white sugar and that was yummy. To the nut mixture i also added 2 Tbsp of melted butter. I had really small fuji apples, so I used three of them and diced rather than sliced them. Baked it for 40 min and it was perfect! Another reviewer said she had to double the cooking time when she used a bundt pan but I checked after 40 min and the skewer came out clean so out came the cake. When turned out onto a plate a bit of the nutty mixture stuck to the bottom of the bundt pan, so i recommend putting on a good thick layer of crisco (I thought I used enough but whoops! We had stickage.) The nut/sugar mix got nice and crispy on the top and the apples stayed nice and moist. Oh, and I used pecans instead of walnuts which were good. Really loved this cake and would love to try it in the proper pan when I get one someday, but it seems pretty forgiving with changes in ingredients, pans etc. Great base recipe. Happy baking!

This cake is delicious!  I baked it in a Bundt pan because I did not have a removable bottom tube pan.  I turned out great although I had to flip it twice to be able to show off the crumb, nut topping.  I used pecans because I like them better and did not have any walnuts.  Due to using the Bundt pan, I found that I had to nearly double to cooking time.  No matter - I still gave it 5 stars because it tastes wonderful and is wonderfully moist.

I followed the other reviews and added the additional apple.  I'm glad I did because even with the addition, it still had just a hint of apple flavor.  I found the cake to be tasty but very dense.  My husband liked it but admitted that he wouldn't have another piece unless he had a drink handy!

I made this at 7000 ft. so I tried using the standard changes for high altitude baking by adding flour and decreasing leavening agents.  I had to add quite a bit of milk to make it anywhere close to cake batter consistency.  I know coffee cake batter is usually thicker but this was like cookie dough at first.  After all that I forgot to put the apples in the middle!  Duh!  I sliced the apple very thinly and put it on top of the cake with extra sugar and cinnamon on top.  At 40 minutes it was no where near done.  I baked it another 13 minutes and it tested done.  But when we sliced it there were parts that could have been more done.  Tasted wonderful though!  My Sunday School class made short work of it!  I'll make it again.

This was absolutely delicious.  Moist and light, a perfect coffee cake.  I did use 2 large apples instead of one and I used brown sugar in the topping and added enough butter to make it a struesel.

This recipe was easy, fantastic, and turned out perfectly! The only thing I did different was:
-- Halved the recipe to make 1 9x5 loaf
-- Used thick Greek yogurt instead of sour cream
-- Used thinly slice almonds instead of walnuts. 
I will definitely be making this again!
p.s. Using white sugar for the topping rather than brown was just fine. By sprinkling it with the cinnamon on top of the loaf before baking, it formed a crispy sugary crust. :)

FABULOUS!!! I made it for my friends at a movie night and it turned out fabulous. Especially love the layer of apples near the bottom. I was afraid I was going to run out of batter, but if you just keep spreading it, it's more than enough to cover everything. I also added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter itself, which gave it a little more flavor. GREAT RECIPE!

SO good...made it for the first time for a group of gals and it was a hit.  I will definately make this again.  I did have a hard time removing the cake from the tube pan.  It didn't stick at all but it wanted to break.  I will make it in a 9x13 pan next time.  You will love this cake!!

I have been making this exact coffee cake for about 40 years so I'm thinking your grandmother and I had the same set of cook books. Everyone raves about this when I make it. It's a family favorite.

This was really good! I made it in a square 8x8 b/c I didn't have a tube pan and I added butter to the topping as other reviewers suggested, but I think it would've been great either way. Really moist and very tasty!

I have been making this wonderful cake for more than 20 years without any problems.  I follow the recipe exactly; my only change is that I usually use a 9" tube pan.  It keeps well if you evfer have any leftover!  Great cake!

Took this to a potluck and it was a hit. Had a little trouble spreading into pan, would recommend a little smaller tube pan.

The cake is so light and the layer of apples is just the right touch. Next time I think I'll put a streusel on top.

This was a big hit.  Moist and delicious.  I did use brown sugar for the topping and two apples otherwise followed recipe as written.  Will definitely make again - my husband suggested dicing apples instead of the thin slices.  I think I will try this next time.

Tried this and was so happy that I did. My Boyfriend loved it and I will certainly make it again. It was fluffy and moist with a crunchy top. I added a wee bit of brown sugar and two extra apples. But otherwise just follow the directions and it will turn out fantastic!

I added a 1/4 c. milk.... not sure it made any difference.  Also made cake in a bundt pan and the filling did stick a bit so... if you are using a bundt, go crazy with the crisco.  But the taste and texture were great, and we loved the apple filling.  I peeled and cored, but then just chopped the apples.  Slicing not really necessary.  This is going to be a family favorite.

Really loved this cake, light, moist, extremely good.  Agree with other reviewer that doesn't need so much sugar. I will reduce it to 3/4c next time. Also changed the sugar in the topping mixture to turbo,to help it melt better ,the nuts to pecans and just about tripled the nuts. This rises 
ALOT , so divide evenly when layering, It will be enough batter, even though it doesn't look like much to start.

Followed recipe exactly.  Cake was dry day 1, but apples softened it overnight.  Nevertheless, I would never recommend this cake.  Batter was just okay - apples pretty non-existent, the sugar layer next to the apples could not be tasted and the sugar topping just added to the dryness of the cake.  Also, the walnuts in the sugar topping on the top of the cake were over-brown.  Can you give zero stars?

Very tasty. One question: are you supposed to put half of the apples in the middle, and the rest of the apples on top? The recipe's not clear on this.

Thanks.
