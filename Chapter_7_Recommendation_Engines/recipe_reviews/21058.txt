Fixed this recipe for a Mardi Gras party and it was a big hit.  Works fine with canned peaches as well.  Also used brown sugar in the sauce for extra flavor.

Consider cutting the sauce in 1/4 unless you like your pudding literally swimming in it.  I think I only used about 1/4 cup for the entire pudding...

This recipe is *fabulous*!!! I made it for a dinner party, and my guests could not stop raving about it.  Also, the recipe can be made "healthier" without sacrificing the taste by substituting the butter for a low-fat butter substitute and the sugar with a sugar substitute.  I've made both versions and cannot tell the difference between the two.

Excellent and easy recipe to make.  I followed the other users suggestions and I made only half the sauce.  For me, certainly plenty - but definitely easy enough to make a second half batch with the leftovers (if there are any!) if we need it.  I too used canned peaches and only half the apples since we only had 2 left - but it was my first try making bread pudding and sure won't be my last.  Thanks Suzanne!

This bread pudding is REALLY good.  With my cajun heritage and many travels to Louisianna, I've had a chance to taste the best.  This ranks among the best I've tasted.  Substitute milk for heavy cream or half & half for a richer pudding.

I gave this 5 stars even though I didn't thing it was outstanding.  Now the sauce was outstanding and this made the dessert!!!  I made this for x-mas, and everyone seemed to enjoy it, but I think I'll keep searching for another bread pudding.  Please note that I used half a challah bread (10-12 oz), and it fit perfectly in the 9 x 13 pan.

What a great recipe for bread pudding!  I have used it as a basic recipe then add what I want fruit, coffee, rum etc.  The condenced milk gives the pudding a great flavor!

Excellent bread pudding.  I used canned peaches as others did and 2 apples that I cooked on the stove a little before I added them - just to make sure they wouldn't be crunchy.  I'll definitely be making this again.  My daughter loved it!

I served this to 24 people (increased the amounts of course).  Everyone had seconds and love it.  However, I substituted peach schnapps instead of whiskey and added some peach schnapps to the pudding and reduced the milk accordingly.  Just wonderful!

This is the perfect bread pudding. I used fresh fruit, which was a pain to clean up, but worth the effort. Also halved the sauce, as suggested by other reviewers. I will be making this again (and again and again) exactly the same way. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Really good!  We halved it and needed to substitute in peaches and pears, pumpkin spice for nutmeg, and heavy cream for whole milk.  We also made a quarter of the whiskey sauce -- note:  do not store the whiskey sauce in tupperware and reheat it in the microwave.

This was pretty good! I did think that the flavor was a little eggy and it was a little to soggy for me...maybe next time I will take out one egg.

Substituted apple cinnamon schnapps (which I discovered while looking for the whiskey which I didn't have).  And served the whole thing with vanilla ice cream. A hit with everyone.

The whiskey sauce alone is worth making this recipe. I want to put it on everything. It would be insanely delicious on pancakes and/or waffles, methinks.

Otherwise, the bread pudding was terrific as well. It's a simple recipe and quick to prepare. This is a hit. Thank you.

This was a very good dessert. My family and I enjoyed it very much. I used pears in place of peaches because of the time of year no fresh peaches.

This was amaaazing!!  I brought it to a friend's house for thanksgiving, who is a professional chef, and two of his friends are in the restaurant industry.  Everyone was raving!

I skipped the peaches and put some rasins instead.  For the sauce I used brown sugar instead of white.  I also served it with a little mascarpone whipped cream on top.  To die for!

I had to make a couple of modifications, as I was making this the same day I needed to serve it. I diced the bread, then spread it on baking sheets and toasted it in the oven at 300* for about 10-15 minutes. I used peaches from a jar, because they are not in season in my area. I cooked the apples in a pot on low for about 15 minutes with a pinch of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. I also used half-and-half on the recommendation of another reviewer. 

The whiskey sauce is the crowning glory of this recipe. It is well-balanced, delicious, and great also on apple crisp! The recipe was easy to follow and I received glowing compliments on the dish. This is a wonderful alternate to pie this holiday season.

This was amazing!  I received rave reviews for this fruity bread pudding.  I did add a lot of walnuts over the top before baking.  I also only made 1/2 of the whiskey sauce and it was still too much.  Great recipe!

This is an outstanding bread pudding. We decided to add raisins soaked in cinnamon flavored vodka--good choice!
We also used King's Hawaiian bread -- makes it very sweet!
I doubled the cinnamon and nutmeg, but that probably wasn't necessary :)
Next time I will use a shallower baking dish, as we really like it kind of crunchy...
Thanks for an amazing recipe! You did well!

I added my own twist, I didn't use any fruit. I use nutmeg, cinnamon, butter, sugar, raisins( which I soak in whiskey over night) and vanilla extract. I made my bourbon/whiskey over the stove. I came out great.

I tried this recipe and changed out the whiskey for Caramel Cream, an Irish liqueor.  Very good. I also cut the recipe in half and still had plenty.

Good stuff!  I made a few changes like used 5 peaches, 1 apple, and a handful of raisins.  I cut out 1/4 cup of the milk, I substituted half the sugar for Splenda, and I used lemon sauce instead of Whiskey sauce.  It shows how versatile this recipe is...it turned out delicious.
