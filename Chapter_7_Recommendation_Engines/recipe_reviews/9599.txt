I only used 1 cup of flour, as other reviewers suggested, and they came out better than I expected!  Very yummy, and not cake-y, just what you would expect brownies to turn out like.  I added some peanut butter chips cuz I like PB brownies.  So good!  This was the first time I've made brownies from scratch, and I'll use this recipe next time I make them too!

Great recipe!!! I did  decrease the  flour to 1 cup as suggested by someone else which makes them less cake like and more like I  personally like my brownies. I then added 1 cup coconut flakes and 1/2 cup chopped pecans... 
Can you say "German Chocolate Cake Brownies"?  Delicious. Thanks for a great recipe even though I get carried away and change recipes up a bit.

I made these while standing and chatting with a friend, and couldn't believe how fast they came together. (Couple beers had skewed my sense of time passage...) The taste is incredible. Made exactly as stated minus the nuts--boyfriend is allergic. No frosting needed! Sprinkled powdered sugar on top, more for looks than anything else. Everyone loved them. Just had one, couple days later, and they are still NOMMY! Update: Made these again with 'help' from my 5 year old. Still super tasty! Just wanted to add that I used about 1/4 c margarine and 3/4 light butter with canola oil, did not notice a change in taste or texture!

As I sit here eating my third brownie from this recipe, I'm listing all that I love about it: cake-like texture, brownie flavour, very chocolately, very easy, and I love the fact that it uses cocoa rather than chocolate squares. (I ALWAYS have cocoa!) I used a 9x9 inch stone baking dish and baked for exactly 30 minutes. Truly delicious! I will use this recipe again, for certain!

Wonderful! I took another reviewer's advice and only used one cup of flour. I also cut the butter in half and substitued 1/2 cup applesauce for the remaining butter. Because of the applesauce, the cooking time was longer - 45 minutes for me - but these are moist and delicious and very easy.

This was my first attempt at making brownies and I must have used the wrong kind of pan (stainless steel) because they were burning at 15 minutes! Literally my fire alarms were set off! I took them out, opened windows to vent the smoke and managed to salvage half of them which were delicious. Next time I will try a glass pyrex dish instead to see if that helps.

Eggs make brownies cake-y and since we like chewy brownies, we used 2 eggs instead of 4, and 1 cup of flour instead of 1 & 1/2. We added 2 tsp of freeze-dried coffee to increase the complexity of the flavor, and created a mocha sensation: they were sensational! Chewy, rich, and moist. I'd definitely make these again -- esp. given how simple they are! Much better than boxed! Our brownies turned out chewy, moist, and chocolate-y!  P.S. We used a 7 x 11" pan, which worked really well.

45 minutes from start to finish, including the baking! What a wonderful recipe! Great for drop-in company.  No icing is necessary.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe lives up to it's name!  We did not have a mix, so I thought I would give it a try.  I hate the mess of melting chocolate (other recipes) and I had cocoa powder on hand.  Also, I used chocolate chips instead of nuts.  They turned out SUPER and I am making them again for a party.  They are still fudgy and chewy the next day (keep covered).  Great warm with ice cream!!

I added 1 cup chocolate chips and swirled 1/2 cup caramel sauce though the mix after adding to the pan.  I also reduced the flour to 1 cup.  Too much flour will give them a cake-like consistency. These brownies turned out pretty good but since I had to alter the recipe somewhat, I give it a 4 star.

These were easy and very good.  Not quite as chocolatey as we like, but still very good.  Also, if you like your brownies less cakey, and more chewy, it's not the flour that does it, it's the eggs.  More eggs=more cake-like brownies; less eggs=chewier brownies.

If it wasn't for the fact these were a little light in chocolate flavor as well as color these would have been the perfect brownie.  Easy to make.  Pleasantly sweet and buttery, but not cloyingly sweet.  Chewy edges and moist, fudgey centers.  Still, they were weak in the chocolate department.  Up the cocoa powder to 2/3-3/4 cup and you'll have THE perfect brownie.

Brownies tasted Great, but I tried baking them in a smaller pan as some said they did... took much too long to cook, well over 1 hour. :( So much for a quick tasty desert.

One of the best recipes on this site.  I've made these countless times and they always get rave reviews.  I've made many variations:  used Hershey's Special Dark cocoa instead of regular and added 3 teaspoons of instant espresso powder.  Switched mint extract for the vanilla and used mint chips instead of walnuts.  Switched orange extract for the vanilla and added some orange zest.  The list goes on and on!  These are so easy and so yummy.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These were definitely fast and easy to make, using ingredients I had onhand. (I also reduced the flour to 1 cup, as other reviewers suggested.) The brownies came out cakelike, with a very mild chocolate flavor. We prefer dense, chewy brownies with a fudgy flavor. This just wasn't the brownie for us, but it would be great if you prefer a cake-like, subtly flavored brownie.

Apparently people felt they needed to change things with this recipe, which I personally thought was weird. Simple is usually better. These brownies are as easy as making boxed brownies but taste better. I did the recipes exactly as stated and they turned out perfect. A wonderful middle between fudgy and cake-like. I make them all the time and everyone has LOVED them!

These brownies were excellent! They are fast, easy and aren't messy. I only added one cup of flour (which is lucky because that's all the flour I had :D) and it came out really chewy and moist the way I love brownies. Also I added 1/4 cup walnuts but I wish I added more because they were great in these brownies. I will definitely make these again!   Update: I made these again and I forgot to mention that I did add 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar, a tablespoon of instant coffee, 3 eggs instead of four and 2/3 cup of cocoa to up the chocolate flavor both times. I also baked for 25 min and they came out very soft and chewy.

Sooo good! I used 1 cup of white sugar, 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 2 eggs, 1 cup of flour and (this may sound strange)I replaced 1/2 of the butter with pureed avocado. It cuts the fat by 35% and makes them ridiculously fudgy and moist. You can't even tell.

I've made these twice in two weeks, and here are my tweaks: used 1 & 1/4 cup flour and only 3 eggs, to reduce the 'cake-like' texture (oh, and 1/3 cup of that flour was whole-wheat: I try to sneak it into as much as I can:);I added 1 cup choc. chips; and, as I was making these I was on the phone (bad idea) and forgot to add the second stick of butter, so with only 1 stick & no additional oil or anything, they were really good- did not miss the extra butter!! Oh, and added 1 cup ground walnuts. Great brownies, and not as horrendously decadent as they might have been! 9/9/09 I make these every couple weeks now- so fast & easy! I discovered that adding a scant Tbls of instant coffee really kicks up the chocolate flavor. And, since some of my family don't like walnuts, I skip them and add 1 cup chocolate chips!

This is definitely a five star brownie with a few adjustments. Like many of the other reviews I would suggest decreasing the flour to 1 cup if you want a chewy brownie. Also watch the bake time, I only baked mine for about 20 to 22 minutes. And don't over beat the mixture. I would beat by hand, adding the eggs one at a time, and would not use a hand/stand mixer. Made these last night and they came out chewy and fudge-like just how we like them.

I've made this recipe TWICE now - that's how good it is! The first time, I used an 8x8 glass dish and used all 4 eggs - it came out more like a CAKE. The second time, I used only 2 eggs and the suggested 9x13 glass dish - and it came out PERFECT :) The secret is in how many eggs/flour you use that makes the difference. For the second batch, I added walnuts and marshmallows for Rocky Road-style brownies and it was a hit :) This will be my go-to brownie recipe now!

These brownies were delicious, moist, chocolatey...I simply loved them! I used 1 cup of flour like many people suggested, and it came out wonderful. My whole family loved them! I'm definitely using this recipe again.

This recipe was a huge hit tonight! I am not a baker by any stretch of the imagination and was hesitant to try "brownies from scratch". I'm so glad that I decided to try and that I found this recipe. I prefer a less cakey brownie, so followed the recommendation of a few others to cut the flour to 1c. I also used only .5c butter and substituted .5c applesauce for the rest of the better. Lastly, I prefer a thicker brownie, so I baked this in a 9x9 pan and increased the cooking time to 55 minutes. They turned out perfect. Thanks for the great receipe!

These were fantastic! Didn't change a thing, topped with powdered sugar. Next time I will up the cocoa (I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa Powder) for a more chocolaty taste. YUM!

I'm not sure why this doesn't have 5 stars!? My goodness... it's easy and truly the most delicious brownie recipe I've ever found. (even if it weren't easy I'd make them!) I used to buy boxed brownies- but this recipe blows them out of the water. I decreased the flour to 1 cup as advised. yum yum yum.

These are good, but you can really taste the butter. I think you have to make sure to mix these REALLY WELL. I recommend an electric mixer.

My husband doesn't really like brownies, but he BEGS me to bake these!  They are so good!  I took the advice of the other reviewers and used 1.25 cups of flour.  I left out the nuts and baked them for exactly 30 minutes.

Very good recipe. I decreased the amount of flour to 1 cup as others suggested and I'm glad I did. The primary reason that I baked those is because I wanted to make Chef John's Holiday Rum Balls (which I did and they are absolutely delicious!) which required stale brownies. Unfortunately, they never got there and stayed moist for ever (week later). I will definitely make them again and will play with different ingredients. This is a keeper. Thank you for sharing with us.

I loved how easy they were to make, and the chocolate flavor was light and cocoa-ey, instead of dense and fudgy. Brownies are usually too intense for me, but I liked these, even though I only got 2 - my BF devoured the rest. He loved them!

Wowza!  I am not an experienced baker, and rarely eat sweets.  Sometimes, though, I really want a Brownie.  Previously when that craving hits I bought a box mix at the grocery store.  Today I found this recipe and low and behold I had all the ingredients on hand.  After reading the reviews about the amount of flour making these too cake like and recommending cutting the flour to 1 cup I decided to compromise.  I didn't want too cake-ey or too gooey, so I made a guess and used a very heaping 1 cup of flour.  I used way more than 1/2 cup walnuts because I love nuts.  Also threw in some chocolate chips (that can never hurt I assume).  These are the Best Brownies I Ever Had.  Never will I buy a box again, these were just as easy and way way way better.

Great tasting brownies and super easy to make. I love that this recipe uses common ingredients so it can be whipped up quickly. I only used 1 cup of flour, and they turned out perfect!

Following the advice of other reviewers, I reduced the flour to 1 cup and increased the cocoa powder to 2/3 cup, because I don't like my brownies cake-like. The brownies were moist, with good chocolate flavor and a nice dense texture. I used a glass 9x13 pan, and they were done in 30 minutes. I took them to a BBQ and everyone there loved them (they disappeared very quickly). The best part is they were as quick and easy as their name indicates.

I took other suggestions and cut the flour to one cup. I also only used three eggs. I wanted mine to be a bit more fudgy. They turned out great! next time I think I would cut back on the butter. But overall a great brownies with stuff I had on hand!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is excellent except for one detail, it is mis-titled.  It should be called "Sugar Butter Bars".  

All I taste is butter and sugar.  There is enough cocoa to make them brown, but not to taste chocolatey.  They don't taste bad, they just don't taste like much.

I was hungry for brownies and decided to try a new recipe, so I picked this one. Well, I'm sorry to say my son and I did not like these at all. The texture was bad and the taste was not any better. I bake bread, cakes, bagels, cookies, etc. from scratch at least twice a week, so baking is nothing new to me, but I'd honestly rather eat brownies from a mix than bake these again. Sorry.

So good...followed others advice and only used 1 cup of flour...came out fudgy.  They looked dry but when you bit into them, they were anything but. I actually tripled the recipe and put walnuts in one batch and then frosted two pans (one with walnuts and one without) using the Brownie Frosting on this site (also very very good).  Ended up with 3 pans...two with frosting and one without.   All three batches disappeared in minutes!  This recipe is a keeper!

The name says it all: quick and easy.  Oh, and delicious.  All the flavor of Duncan Hines, none of the cost (and processing?).  Cut down the flour to 1 C as recommended in the comments.

Excellent, quick and easy!  One word of caution as I just finished making my 3rd batch today for a youth function tonight...on the first batch, I was lazy and dumped all ingredients and THEN mixed with a wooden spoon.  Still tasty, but a totally different color and slightly different texture as the ingredients settled a little more unusually.  The last two batches, I mixed with a WHISK after EACH additonal ingredient.  Fantastic texture and rich chocolatey color!  It made a big difference whisking after adding each ingredient.  My husband is a very picky brownie eater and he tried one and said they were delicious!  No more brownie packages for me!  I also eliminated the extra 1/2 cup flour and used only one cup.

This  recipe is fantastic, I did use less flour as others did but think it would be great either way.  Simple, fast and excellent tasting!  Who could ask for more?  Small gripe about those who gave less stars because they changed it, I think they should not rate it if they changed it so much!  This recipe deserves every star it got!

Really yummie and very easy.  Very similar to another brownie recipe here, so I generally make one of the two.  I cut down on the sugar a little to make them less sweet.  Wonderful recipe!

These are absolutely wonderful!  We decreased the flour to one cup and increased the cocoa to 2/3 cup and sprinkled semi-sweet chocolate chips on the top before baking (left out the walnuts-personal preference).  Baked them for 28 minutes in a glass 9x13 and they turned out great!  Easy enough that my 9 year old daughter was the cook...with very little help from me.

I made 2 batches of this recipe...the first I made with only 1 cup of flour as per suggestions from others and the second I made following the original recipe.  I liked both but prefer the more "fudgy" recipe using less flour.  The original recipe is great but tastes like a chocolate cake...which I will start using as my new chocolate cake recipe!

I've been without an oven for 2 months while the repair guy keeps ordering and trying different parts.  I cooked these on a grill which held at around 350 degrees - it worked Great!!  My kids were pumped to have a baked good after so many weeks.  Super with ice cream on top!!  Thanks for this awesome recipe.

They came out incredible! These were the first brownies for me, ever. Because they're not so common in northern europe. I made only 10 servings, and cut the walnuts. I also used a hand-made tin foil pan put onto a bigger pan in the oven, because i figured, the other one would be too big. Thanks for the great recipe!

As written there seems to be too much flour which makes them heavier.  Like others suggested 1 cup is enough.  Also, I use only 1/4 tsp. of baking powder because too much of it in brownies takes away from the moistness.

Wow - these taste better than any brownie mix out there. These are very simple to make, with ingredients that I always have on hand...which could be dangerous! They are definitely not low fat with a full cup of butter and 4 eggs, but they are scrumptious! I added white chocolate chips to my mix to give it another dimension and dropped the flour down to 1 cup like other reviewers suggested. You won't be sorry you made these...although your thighs might be!

Overall, a pretty decent brownie. They were a little bit too cakey for me and didn't have as much chocolate flavor in my opinion. If you are looking for a more cakey, less chocolatey brownie, you would love this one.

These are delicious and choclatey and moist but definetely cake-like. If you are a fudgy fan instead of cake like brownie fan, than this isn't your recipe! Personally I am a cake like brownie person through and through. I added 1/2 cup of chopped pecans but would add more next time (and I normally don't do nuts in my baked goods).

I brought these to a party I went to and they were a big hit! I cut down the flour like others suggested. Definitely quick and easy~

I read through the reviews before I made these. Because there were quite a few people who decreased the flour to one cup, that's what I did as well. That was the only change I made. This turned out a fudgy, chewy brownie that I was able to whip up quickly with very basic pantry items. My husband will sure appreciate these tonight.

I reduced the sugar to 1 cup + 1/2 cup brown sugar and it still tasted too sweet. It was so gooey that it took me 45 min to bake it, then it gave me lots of frustration to cut it, it was too soft and crumbly. The cut was ugly, I can never bake this to take anywhere unless the people are ok in eating with a spoon out of the pan.

So first time I made these, I used one cup of flour as some of the other reviews had mentioned. I also subbed some of the butter for applesauce. Amazing! made them again this past weekend, and decied to try flour amount as written, ( still used half butter, half applesauce), and the result was chewy cake, not brownies. Although they were good and edible, they were not brownies.  I will use this recipe again and again, but will only be using one cup of flour.

This took 45 min. to bake in an 8x8 pan w/ the reduced 1 cup of flour. But the brownies were still soft the next morning. And the family LOVED them.

The only alteration I made to this recipe was that I used a 1/4 cup of butter LESS than it called for, because I ran out...but this didn't seem to affect the recipe.  They were still moist and chewy and a very yummy brownie.  This is a good recipe to make if you aren't in the mood for anything fancy, just a good ol' fashioned brownie.  Nice to serve with vanilla ice cream.  I suggest using large size eggs to reduce "cakeiness".

I followed the recipe exactly, but my brownies were very dry and not very chocolately at all.  They didn't resemble brownies from the box but were more like a pale chocolate cake.  The taste was good, however, fresh and buttery.  Just not brownie-like.

I made these brownies, they were great! As some reviewers suggested, I used 1 cup of flour and only 2 eggs, to make them less cake like and more chewy, I also added some chocolate chips to the batter. They came out PERFECT! They were  easy to make,

this brownie recipe was truly awesome! i wasnt even expecting to find a brownie recipe this great. i was craving something sweet..so i literally googled "easy brownie recipes"...and this was the 1st one that came up. all i wanted was something that tasted descent and that i had all the ingredients on hand. i had all these ingredients in my pantry..so i gave it a shot. i did not expect it to be the best tasting brownie i've ever had. this is definitely the best tasting brownie i've ever had! so moist and chewy. although..i must mention that i did listen to the other reviewers and i used 1 cup flour instead of 1 and 1/2.

First attempt at making brownies from scratch, these seemed to turn out just okay.  We certainly didn't have trouble polishing them off but I might try a new recipe next time.

Delicious!  I agree about the 1 cup of flour instead of 1 1/2 cups.  Instead of walnut halves, I use Ghirardelli chocolate chips and then top the hot brownies with vanilla ice cream or frozen yogurt.  My family loves it.

Let me start by saying I have TERRIBLE luck with brownies. They usually burn, fall flat or just don't taste good but this recipe? Well it was great! The brownies were thick, moist and delicious. I followed other reviews and used only one cup of flour, I also substituted the walnuts for white chocolate chips. This is a definite keeper which I will be making again and again!

umm these brownies are AWESOME!!! I must admit though I have done it both with the full amount of flour and with only 1 cup and I found the reduced amount to make better brownies but that's just my preference and with the full amount of flour they are still delicious! great recipe!! I also use pecans rather than walnuts (only because I always have these on hand)

I halved the recipe to just make a few one evening.  I baked them in a loaf pan for about 26 minutes and they turned out great.  Moist and chewy.  I did not have enough butter either, so I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup oil.  Worked out great.  Not quite chocolatey enough for my taste.  I may add a bit more cocoa powder next time or add some chocolate chips.

325 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/9599/quick-and-easy-brownies/ ... I looked through many, many, manyyyy brownie recipes in search of a fudgy one where I'd follow the recipe, not a "helpful" review to make them that way.  Apparently, I made or was going to make these before & took notes.  I went by my notes, which, yes, had changes - for fudgy brownies.  Three eggs, one cup of flour.  Oh, 1 3/4c sugar.  I can't say these were fudgy or almost fudgy, but they were more a brownie than cake.  I'd say half brownie, half cake.  So, these were good; just not fudgy enough for me.  'Glad I tried.  They're almost half gone & I made 'em yesterday.

This recipe turned out excellent. I couldn't believe how easy this was..only took maybe 5 minutes longer than opening a boxed brownie mix! The only change I made was to use butter flavored shortening instead of butter (I didn't have enough butter). Personally I think doubling the walnuts would be better, at least what little I got to eat...my daughter and mostly my husband wolfed it down! My husband even joked don't make it again because he wants to eat the whole pan in one sitting! Definitely going to try it again with double walnuts and maybe I will also try pecans.

The first time I made this I cut back on the cocoa because most brownies are too chocolatey for my tastes.  Mistake!  The cocoa taste barely came through.  I made it again with the correct amount and they are perfect.  If you like things really chocolatey, I'd add some chunks of chocolate to the batter.

I freeze this batter in two 8x8 pans.  I bake from frozen and add about 8-10 minutes onto the cooking time.  I love having a pan in the freezer for last-minute potlucks, etc.

These were easy and yummy.  I made them with my three kids (9,6,and 3YO) and followed the recipe - except substituted 1 cup of Splenda for one of the cups of sugar.  I did use the 1 1/2 cup flour and the brownies were cake-like.  I think I'll try 1 cup flour as others recommend next time.

These were just as the title says, quick and easy.  I used the exact measurement of ingredients, but as is my habit, I combined all the dry ingredients and then added it to the combined wet ingredients.  These would have been perfect if they had a little more intense chocolate flavor, but they are certainly better than any brownie mix you would buy.

These are the best brownies ever. We make them all the time. You need to follow the recipe exact. I cut in in half twice and it is just not the same, they were dry. People ask for my recipe when I make these.

Made these with my homescholers and they were absolutely perfect. I used half butter/margarine and half vegetable oil. Unexpected family came over and they did not last the night. Even those not crazy about chocolate could not resist! Perfect!!

Not only are these quick and easy, but they are delicious! I'm not even a brownie fan, and it was hard to put them down. Delicious! This is one recipe I will be making again and again.

I made these last night in a craving for chocolate dessert, and they couldn't have been more perfect. Even my husband, who is a bakery snob (courtesy of his mother, who is an amazing baker), said how good they were. Since there are only two of us, I halved the recipe, and we devoured about 2/3 of it in one night. Absolutely delicious and so easy!! Will totally make this again and again and again.

Oh, and I also used only 1 cup of flower for the full recipe (or 1/2 cup for the halved recipe), as the other reviews recommended.

I'm not a novice cook, by any means, so I suspect the flaw is in the recipe.  I made them exactly according to the recipe.  Brownies were raw inside, overcooked outside.  Decreased the flour.  Same problem.  Changed the size of the pan.  Same problem.

I reduced the flour to 1C, and it made a quick and easy 'light' brownie. Nothing I would crave, but definitely enough to give me my brownie fix. Took at least 45 minutes to bake, but that may have been my oven not being at temp.

I added these dark chocolate and mint chips in the mix that i found at the store this week.  I melted 3/4 c, then folded in 1/2 c and sprinkled the rest on the top.  I also upped the amount of cocoa to 1 c for a darker brownie, for my personal tastes.  I liked the idea of brownie wedges so I baked in a round cake pan.  Turned out great.

Super easy and delic.  My first time making browneis.  I did make them exact per the recipe.  I used my 9 x 13 glass pan and it did take an additional 10 minutes, and the outside was a little dry and inside nice and moist.  Thanks for posting this easy recipe.  Now, I just have to figure out how much time to leave it in so the top doesn't dry out.  Maybe 35 minutes, next time.    This recipe is a keeper!

Oh my God........these brownies are so good!!!!  I decreased the sugar by a 1/2 cup, increased the cocoa powder to 3/4 cup as suggested and omitted the walnuts.  Perfect receipe and so quick and easy.  I will never use a boxed brownie mix again!

Easiest brownies recipe I ever made!! This is my second time making these brownies and they get so many rave reviews from everyone who tastes them. I couldn't even resist licking the bowl clean, they were just that good!! I used oil instead of margarine and it came out fine.

wow, those were quick and easy, and really really good the next day.  I was iffy about them, since I tried to eat them warm out of the oven, and they didn't taste great, but after they cooled down and sat around for a day they were sooooo good!

I made these into brownie bites. Really yummy! Cakey outside, fudgy inside. Used 1 1/4 cups flour instead of 1 1/2. Baked in mini-muffin tin for 15 mins at 350 degrees. Perfect!

These brownies tasted good and were easy to make, but mine turned out like flat pancakes. I tried to use less sugar so maybe that's why.

I cut the flour back to 1 1/4 cups and they were still very cake-like (which is ok, because my family likes cake-like brownies) so if you wanted a denser brownie, cut the flour back to 1 cup.  I also used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce to try and make them a little healthier.  Really enjoyed these!

YUMMY!!!!  These are VERY tasty!  I didn't use (like most bakers suggested) all the flour and I didn't have any vanilla or walnuts.  They still came out extremely good, soft and chocolate and so easy to make!

Very good, but very sweet. As others recommended, I reduced eggs to 3 and butter to 1/2 C. The brownies turned out gooey and chocolatey - better than the box mixes I used to love. Next time I'll try reducing the sugar to 1 1/2 C.

This is excellent. I made a batch for my friends' kids for the huge Thanksgiving party we're having and had to make a second batch right away because the first batch was already gone. I wasn't sure I liked the taste at first but the more I ate, the more I loved it! I'll definitely make this again. It was so easy and fast.

This is an excellent recipe, easy to prepare. I sometimes change the nuts to peanut butter chips or chocolate chips or do both. I am planning on making some for the holidays with white chocolate chips. My 12 year old says these brownies are famous and he tells me I have to make them whenever there is a potluck or community event. I won't buy boxed brownies ever again.

A definite hit; definitely use one cup of flour, and be sure to mix the ingredients in the 'standard' order - sugar and butter first, then eggs and vanilla, and then add all the dry ingredients, with nuts or chocolate chips last (I used chocolate chunks from chocolate squares); so simple to make and so tasty!

this was really quick and to make it even quicker I used 1 cup veg oil instead of melting the butter.  Also used 1cup flour and three eggs and this came out well.  Will try to make as is next time to really rate this.

Great Recipe! I made the brownies with only 3 eggs and 1 1/4 cup of flour as suggested by a previous review. They were most, chewy and fudgy, could not be better!

This is a really good brownies recipe! I love it because it used cocoa which I always have on hand and you don't need to melt chocolate. 

When I made them I found out I only had half of the number of eggs called for so I made it just with the ones I had on hand and they turned out great. I baked half of the amount in an 9x9 dish for 30 min and after cooling down they were very nice and moist. I also iced them with a mixture of 3 tablespoons of melted butter mixed with 3 tablespoons cocoa powder, 1 tablespoon runny honey and half a cup of confectioners' sugar. My boyfriend thought they were delicous and they never last more than a day in our house!

Not so good on this end. Unsure what happened. Of course we'll eat anything remotely chocolate but it was a toss-up between cake or brownie. Texture confusion. Will have to find another recipe. :0(

Very good/simple recipe. Made two batches. One batch I made with only 1 cup of flour like the other reviews suggested, and it seemed to be very "cakey" still. I also made one batch with only 1 cup of flour and added just an additional 1/4 cup (approx.) of melted semi-sweet chocolate. Very rich and more fudge like. This batch was excellent; everyone loved them. Will be a staple in my house.

I made these last night and they are unbelievable! Literally took 5 minutes start to finish then 18 minutes in the oven. Very little cleanup afterward as an added bonus! So soft and so chocolatey! I did half the recipe and baked them in a round 8 inch pan. I also added 4 tbsp of chocolate syrup to the batter. This will be my brownie recipe from now on!

With some revisions, it was a very good recipe (hence the 4 stars).  We like fudgier brownies with a heavy chocolate flavor, so I reduced the flour to 1 cup, increased the cocoa to 3/4 cup, added 1/2 cup of chocolate syrup as the last ingredient.  I also cooked them in a spring form pan for about 45 minutes and it produced a thick, moderatly chewy brownie in the end.  Delicious!

Yummy brownies from scratch!  Sometimes a little too cake-like for my tastes, but that can always be adjusted.  I usually add a cup of chocolate chips to the batter and dust the top with powdered sugar after pulling from the oven.

I LOVE this brownie.  My only small change was I used Special Dark cocoa instead of the normal cocoa.  Oh man, Dark, rich and chewy.  I've made it one time with a handful of chocolate chips in it and I had mixed  reviews.  Some thought it was "sublime" and I thought it was to sweet.  Your call.  I'd say try the Dark choco Cocoa.  you will not be disappointed.

I made this recipe for my DD's yearbook class, with melted mini M&Ms on top, and they were a huge hit! After reading reviews, I made the following tweaks: 1.5 cups sugar, 3/4 cup real butter, and 1 cup A/P flour. Best when made a day before and refrigerated overnight. YUM!!

I baked 11 dozen of these over a two day period, on dozen for my family and 10 for my students.  They were a huge hit.  The first time I followed the suggestions in the reviews and only used 1 cup of flour and three eggs.  They were good, but not as good as the others that I made according to the recipe, with the exception of using only 1/2 stick of butter.  They were easy, fast and delicious. I'll never buy a box mix again.

THE BEST BROWNIES!!!!   I melted the butter in a double broiler, added the sugar cup by cup, whisking well in between. after i added the cocoa and vanilla I removed it from the heat, before adding the eggs, one at a time, whisking well in between.   also added one cup of walnuts and one cup of chocolate chips.    Yummy!

I followed this recipe word for word but a large portion of the center was completely soupy!! After cooking it on a lower temp for an extra 20 minutes, it was finally acceptable but I wouldn't call them brownies. More like "cake". I gave it more than one star because I cut it up, stuck it in the microwave and put some ice cream over it which was yummy.

Awesome brownies! I think they taste even better than box mix brownies. And they're so easy, too! The only thing I did was add a splash of milk for easier consistency because the batter was a bit thick. Another hint: The brownies taste best the day they were made. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used only one cup flour (I only use whole wheat) as was suggested and texture wise they are right in between cakey and chewy which I like.  I feel like all that butter makes them very greasy though.  I definitely would add more chocolate next time, either more cocoa powder or chocolate chips-or ideally both!  Very simple recipe and a snap to whip up in a jiffy!

I love these brownies. I do use less flour as we like chewy as opposed to cake like. But my reason for the review is this, how in the world is someone burning these things in 15 min??? I cook them a bit longer than called for or they aren't even done but I do use dark pan.

They were easy and very fast to make, but they lacked the right texture for some reason. More like chocolate cake with a brownie top. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used less flour and more chocolate. The taste was good, but not fudgey or decadent like a brownie. Turned out like very sugary chocolate cake. Maybe even less flour next time? I'll try this again some other time and see if they turn out better.

These were very sweet, and I love sweets. But too sweet for even me. The kids enjoyed them, though, so I would make them again. I did cut the flour to 1 cup as some reviewers suggested, which gave them a great brownie consistancy. Maybe next time I'll use a little less sugar.

These brownies turned out better than I expected! They were the most delicious brownies I've ever had, and I'm a big brownie person.

I am not a brownie lover but my husband is so I made these for him.  Per other reviews, I only used 1 cup of flour because I know he likes more of a dense brownie, and he said they were very good but still too cakey.  I thought they were fine, but I could see if you added the additional 1/2 cup they would be.  So 4 stars for him, and 5 for me.  They are so easy to make, and I always have all of the ingredients on hand.

Best brownies I've ever made! So easy to make; you'll never make brownies from a box again! :) 

I also reduced the flour to 1 cup and added half a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips for extra extra chocolatey-ness. hehe 

AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME

My family gobbled up these brownies in moments!

Fantastic!  I've never made brownies before, and these couldn't have turned out more perfect.  I followed everyone's advice and used 1 cup of flour.  The brownies are moist and chewy.  So awesome.

I made these for the Rum Balls recipe by Chef John (Foodwishes).  The only problem is that I may eat them all before they get turned into Rum Balls :P

These brownies came out very dry and cakey, and I did not overbake them. I used only one cup of flour, as others suggested, so I don't even know how the 1.5 cup recipe would come out. Sorry, but they just weren't that good, and unfortunately, now I have a huge batch of so-so brownies that I don't want to even give away, lest people associate me with them.

Didn't make any changes to the recipe, except for halving it. And I made a rooky mistake in baking them on grill setting which meant the bottom half wasn't really cooked. (made the browns all gooey and delicious so I didn't mind)
Easy, fast, delicious.

These brownies are amazing! I decresed the flour to 1 cup as suggested and they have the fudgy texture i crave in brownies. I usually top these with the cheesecake topping in the Cheesecake brownies recipe. I also double both recipes because no one can get enough. My family and friends rave about these!

Very yummy.  I used one cup of flour, as suggested, an extra 1/4 c cocoa, used only 3 eggs.  I also omitted the nuts.  But to make these brownies extra special, I spread half of the batter in a 13x9 pan, laid 2 large symphony candy bars (the ones with toffee and nuts in it) on top of the batter, then topped with the remaining half of the batter.  Bake per the recipe.

Very disappointed.  The picture listed with the recipe is not how they turn out.  This is a mild chocolate cake due to the 4 eggs that are used.  If you read a brownie mix it usually calls for 2 eggs for fudgy and 3 eggs for cake like brownies.  It's my fault though, I didn't think about that when I was making them.  It had such good reviews for the most part.  I made a buttercream icing to put on top since it was cake; that's the only way my family would eat them.

Crazy unbelievable good! I made them as listed but I did change it up and add the frosting from the Best Brownies recipe on this site. I think the brownies would've been fantastic without the glaze but it did give them a little bit more choco-liciousness.

These brownies have too much of a cake-like texture. They are not chewy at all. I followed the recipe step by step but was very disappointed by the outcome. I'm looking for a great taste combine with a nice chewy texture in brownies. So the search continues....

Ok... I was in desperate need for an easy brownie recipe. I found this one a few weeks ago and saved it instantly. Well today I was in the mood but decided I'd look for a different one. 20 minutes go by so I said forget it and made this one. I only made 1change the the recipe. I used 3/4 cup cocoa powder. Everything else was exact minus the nuts. They are so darn good. I didn't mix them in the order given and I think that helped me as well. But overall this is the perfect brownie. I plan to make them again tomorrow and mix in some chocolate chips as well. This is definately a keeper!!!!

Very easy and good! Did reduce to 1 cup flour, I like gooey brownies.  Cleaned up my pantry by adding what I had leftover from other recipes which was 3/4 cup flaked coconut, 1/2 cup mini choco. chips and 1/2 cup pecan pieces, very good!

I have to agree that these were really cake-like. I personally like a chewy brownie. Also, these were not chocolate-y enough for my taste, despite the good cocoa I used. I would decrease flour to 1 cup, decrease sugar to 1 1/2 cup, increase cocoa to 3/4 cup and decrease butter to 1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup). I'll try it again, altered... a good basic starting recipe that definitely needs some tweaking.

Very easy to make and quite tasty, but just a tad dry.  Goes great with a glass of milk though.  I sprinkled dark chocolate chunks on top before I put them in the oven, to add some yum factor.

These were OK but I wouldn't make them again.  I like that they were quick and easy and just took one bowl to make, but the cakes did not have a rich chocolate flavor.  If you like a light chocolate, cake brownie, you might like these, but I prefer something a bit richer.

Very cake like and not as fudgy or sweet as I'd hoped.  Although I was looking for a recipe in which to swirl in Nutella, so the that made up for any faults with this recipe. ;)  VERY easy, though, which was convenient!

Ok, so it is after 1:00 am but I had to sit down and write this review. I had a box of store bought brownies in the pantry but really wanted to give these a whirl. Though brownies are not what anyone would call "healthy" I still like to control what is in the food I eat.  I appreciate that I knew exactly what went into these brownies. They took about 27 minutes in a 13 x 9. I let them cool for about 20 minutes before I cut them and they were heavenly! I am eating them as I type! I used one cup of flour instead of 1 1/2 cuz I like my brownies more fudge like. Besides that I followed exactly. After each ingredient I stirred to combine. Came out great! No more box brownies. I also like the ease of putting these together. No chocolate melting. The top doesnt look the same as box brownies when they are baking but they taste wonderful. Give em' a go! You probably have everything to make these already in your fridge/pantry.

As an avid home baker/cook I rarely have failures, but this is one of them. I did not care for these brownies! I prepared them exactly as it's listed, in a glass 9x13 pan. They took longer to cook, about 45 min, and came out cakey (which is fine) but not chocolatey at all. I use a good quality dutch cocoa even and it just didn't cut it. It's like a pale tasting cake. Now I have a whole pan of these things that I won't eat.

These brownies are wonderful! They come out soft and moist. They taste like milk chocolate, which my husband prefers to dark chocolate. Thanks for the recipe.

This turned out to be a very good brownie recipe & very quick to throw together! I have another recipe on here that I like to use for more fudge-like brownies, but this one is great for a more cake-like brownie. Sometimes we want one or the other, so it's good to have recipes for both. The only change I made was to leave out the walnuts since I was out of them. Everything else was perfect. Thanks for sharing this recipe! :)

Well I followed the other people's advice and used only 1 cup flower, then I made a mistake and added 1 extra egg. Whoops! I didnt have regular cocoa so used dutch cocoa...the result, most, dark chocolate brownies that I got rave reviews on all evening! Best from scratch brownies ever and SO easy!

This is the 3rd brownie recipe I have made from this site and by far the best. They turned out moist and stayed fresh tasting for 3 days. I will go back to this recipe again.

This recipe taught me a lot about brownies. I made these to satisfy a request from my family for a treat. I used chocolate chips instead of walnuts and served them with Dream Whip, creating a craving-satisfying dessert. Personally I found these weren't quite sweet enough and tasted somewhat eggy. Next time I would likely use less flour as previous reviewers suggested and perhaps one less egg.

I picked this recipe for my son who requested a brownie cake for his birthday.  I followed the directions exactly to achive a cake like brownie.  I used Bakers Joy to coat a 9x13 glass pan.  They did not stick.  The taste was very good.  Next time I make them, I will follow the suggestions to make them more fudgy.

Easy and Yummy.  We prefer cake like brownies so I used the full 1 1/2 cps of flour.  I used half butter and half veg. oil.  Next time I will measure and mix flour baking pwdr and salt before adding to wet gredients, since I could taste to much salt in some bites.   Love this recipe.

I cut back the flour, as recommended. It took longer to cook the center in a glass dish. The middle took awhile so the outer edges were dryer. But each day..It kept getting better and better.:0) !! I used chocolate frosting which made the day!!Next time I made add some applesauce for more moistness! I was so surprized that there were 4 eggs in this recipe!! My family can't keep their hands off of it!

These were incredibly easy to make and absolutely delicious.  5 minutes after I set them out to be served they were gone.  I also reduced the flour to one cup to get more fudgy brownies.  Today I'll be using this same recipe but will add in cream cheese swirls.  It's hard for me to find a recipe I can trust over and over again but I see this one as a fail safe

OMG...these brownies were amazing.  Definitely decrease the flour to 1 c.  if you're not a cake brownie lover.  I used GF flour.  Used 1 1/2 c. granulated with 1/2 c. brown sugar for the 2 c. of sugar.  Next time I'll decrease the total sugar to 1 3/4 c.  It was a little too sweet for me.  Also used 1/2 c. oil and 1/2 c. butter and increased the cocoa to 2/3 c.  Increased baking time to 40-45 mins. Thanks to everyone for their suggestions.

I like this recipe but as others have suggested, I changed a few things. I use 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup of cocoa powder (gives it extra chocolate taste), 3 eggs, 1 cup of flour, 1 tablespoon sour cream and 75 grams of chocolate chips. Ok maybe that was a lot of things I changed lol! Turned out very chocolatie and every time I make them people ask for the recipe.

After I mixed things all up I tasted the batter and I was not pleased. After I got them out of the oven. I looked at them and was not pleased. After I cut them and tasted them I was shockingly impressed! What an excellent recipe for brownies. I have never had such a brownie ever. I changed the sugar to 1 2/3, the cocoa to 2/3 cup, and the flour to 1 cup, and added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. For my son who's on a gluten free diet I used GF flour for his and they turned out fantastic for him too! THis recipe is certainly a KEEPER. From now on it's the only recipe for brownies I will use. Thank you!!

Holy moly, was that a good brownie! I've never made brownies from scratch before. This recipe is awesome! The only things I did differently were reduce the flour to 1 cup per the recommendation of others and add chocolate chips. I also cooked them for the full 30 mins in a 9X13 glass pan. These might be the best brownies I've ever had.

I probably should have decreased the flour like others said but decided instead to follow the recipe as is--was not impressed--I should have added chocolate chips--not chocolately enough for me. However, I brought them to work and everyone was loving them.....I melted chocolate chips on it when I took it out of the oven which resulted in a great frosting.

I like brownies soft and gooey, so I put them in for 25 minutes. I took the advice of other reviewers and only used 1 cup of flour. My mum complained that they were a bit too soft, but she liked the taste. I have to admit making them so soft they were harder to cut, but sooo good. I was worried they'd be too dry, but they were very moist. My older brother keeps trying to steal the remaining ones that I'm giving to my friends! He absolutely LOVED them. I used less sugar than it says, but they were extremely sweet anyway and I added frosting. This recipe is VERY hard to mess up, and those were some of the best brownies I've had! I think while still warm they'd be great in ice cream, too.

I'm not sure what happened here....They have an awesome chocolate taste, but, even though I followed the recipe exactly, I had to bake them for almost an hour. I took them out as they were getting way too hard around the edges, but they are still not done in the middle. They've sat for several hour and are completely cool now, but they are still too gooey in the center. But, I still gave 4 stars because they so taste good, and though I don't know what it is, I'm sure I did something wrong.....

Great brownies! I agree that this brownie recipe is more cake-like, but i actually like them better this way. I used 1 1/4 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup light brown sugar (because i was low on white sugar) and sprinkled pecan crumbs & powdered sugar on top. My kids just finished eating them and my 3 year old son said, "Delicious, mommy!"  Thanks for the quick and easy dessert! ;)

these turned out great and couldn't have been easier to make (1 pan on the stove then straight to the baking dish).  I didn't reduce the amt of flour, though other reviewers suggested doing so and indeed they were a bit cakey.  The taste was still great though and everyone loved them.  Next time I will try reducing the flour, but on the whole I think this is a delicious brownie!  thanks.

When i made these i didn't mix it very well. I added everything and then started to mix so there was a lot of clumps in the mix. I'm not much of a baker. So the brownies did not have a lot of taste at all, i don't know if its because of me or the recipe, but mine didn't come out very well.

These were different than boxed brownies... but SO much better!  I reduced flour to 1-1/8 cup and replaced the 1 cup of butter with 1/2 cup butter & 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.  I didn't have any walnuts so I threw in 3/4 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips.  I used a 9x9 pan and they took longer to bake but boy are these EXCELLENT!  This is the first time I baked brownies from scratch and this recipe was easy and delicious!!  Thanks for the recipe, it's a definite keeper!

The more I ate this the more I loved them! They aren't the same consistency as store bought brownies, which I guess made them even better. They were like having a brownie from a really good restuarant. Would taste great with fresh whip cream or vanilla ice cream. Everyone loved them! Would love to find a way to make them healthier. Will definetely make these again.

I try to make all my recipes as healthy as possible (but still be good).  I followed other reviews and used 1 C of flour and also used 1/2 C smart spread and 1/2 C organic applesauce and 3/4 C organic sugar.  It was still more cakey than chewy, but good and chocolaty and not too much guilt!  Will try again but will likely experiment again with it.

Quick and easy but missing that wow factor. My son loved these; but both my husband and I agreed that they weren't as chocolaty as were accustomed to, and that was a bummer.

Definitely a keeper! I cut back the flour to a cup as suggested and these turned out great! Not too cakey but not too gooey and fudgey...just a great classic brownie that everyone would enjoy.

YUM YUM YUM.  Works great in 2 8x8's.  No topping necessary when you're using 2 sticks of butter.  Just a nice big glass of milk :)

Very good! A few suggestions:  1. Use a 11x7 pan. A smaller pan makes thicker brownies.  2. Many users suggested lowering the flour amount to only 1 c so the brownies will be less cake-like. I suggest lowering it only to 1 1/4 c so they remain thick but adding 1/4 c vegetable oil to make them extra moist and more dense.  I can't decide whether the brownies are slightly TOO sweet. The 2 cups of white sugar creates a distinct, strong type of sweet. Next time I may lessen the white sugar to 1 1/2 c and then add some semi-sweet choc chips to compensate. I like rich, chocolaty brownies but I don't particularly like the ultra sugary flavor of white sugar.     Overall, I really like this recipe and will definitely use it again. It was quick, easy, and I LOVE that is uses cocoa instead of chocolate squares. I always have cocoa, so I can create these on a whim without having to plan ahead or run to the store.

A delicious recipe.  So good, in fact, that my husband begged me to make another batch the moment that this was gone.  I actually made this with "One Minute Chocolate icing" and it made something far too nummy for words.  Do use 1 cup of flour instead of the entire amount and be ready for a brownie that is more cake than dense fudge.

I was not a fan of these. I'm not sure if I did anything wrong but they were not very fudgy or chocolatey. And 1/2 tsp of salt was too much (I definitely tasted the salt). I made them two days ago and the pan is still sitting on my counter with only the two brownies my husband I tried that day missing. = (

Wonderful Brownie recipe! Incredibly simple, great that it uses cocoa powder instead of bar chocolate. Wary of messing with a new recipe too much, but also not wanting chocolate 'cake' brownies, I took the flower down to 1 1/4 cups. That's the only thing I did different. Cooked 25 minutes in a glass 9X13 pan. Perfect taste - not too strong.

AWESOME! I had to cook these a bit longer than 30 min since I used a 9x13 GLASS dish but they came out great. Crunchy on top and CHEWY GOOEY on the inside...YUM!!!! I have never made brownies from scratch before ever (always used a betty crocker mix) but I can whip this up in a jiffy with ingredients on hand. I did omit the walnuts cuz I didn't have any but I will have to make them with them the next time! Thanks so much for posting!

These brownies are amazing.  I used only 1 cup flour as some reviews suggested.  They were chewy on the inside with a slightly crunchy top.  You could probably use a 9x9 pan for thicker brownies.  I may try that next time because I WILL make this again!

I was super disappointed with these brownies.  I was looking for a recipe that was softer than mine, and these were definitely not it.  Non only did they bake for almost an hour, they were hard on the edges.  At the 30 min, when they should be done, they were still totally uncooked in the center.  Needless to say, I am very disappointed in this recipe.

Surprised by how good they are, considering the ease. Used 1 c flour, 1/2 c butter, 1/2 c applesauce and left everything else. It has a strange wet coating on top, but it kind of adds to the deliciousness.

Some of the best brownies I've had. I love gooey brownies, so I cut the flour to 1 c like the other reviewers stated. I also don't like nuts in my brownies (and was making them for a group that included a tree nut allergy) so I left those out. I dusted with powdered sugar like in the picture.  It wasn't clear from the recipe whether I should mix the ingredients in one at a time or all at once, so I did them one at a time.  I would estimate that this recipe is almost as easy as a box mix.

Absolutely the best! Family and friends love it. The only thing I do that has been suggested is to cut back on the flour by 1/2 cup. I will never buy box brownies again.

Very easy. I made this with Splenda, and used half butter/half oil. Was a little cakey, that could have been from the Splenda.. Will try again with less flour. It was very good for a cake but didn't turn out gooey and moist like a brownie (again... probably due to the fake sugar!) Thanks for the post.

I made brownies from scratch only *once* before and was hesitant to attempt it again. However, these actually turned out great! Yay!  I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8x8x2 pan at the time and temp specified in the recipe. Otherwise, I didn't change a thing and am very happy with them. Thanks for sharing!

Yum. I used 1 cup flour like others recommended - and 1/2 cup brown sugar/1 cup sugar.  Fast and easy for quick company. Baked 30 minutes until done.  Thanks!

I made two batches of brownies, just to see the difference.  It was big! These tasted good by themselves.  But if you ate one after eating one of the Fudge Brownies I.  It was a real yuck.. The fudge brownies are much better.

As recommended, I used 1/2c less flour.  I also added about 1/2c of chocolate chips and I really think that made them even yummier!  I tried Alton Brown's recipe for brownies and I liked these MUCH better!  Thanks!

If you follow the suggestions of only using 1 cup of flour these are amazing. You can throw them together in about 5 minutes and they taste great. They need a full hour to cool to a decent texture and really come into their own the next day.

I only used 1 cup of flour and used 1 1/2 cups of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. These brownies were probably the best brownies I've ever had. They were incredibly moist and rich, but not overly so. They're all gone now, and my boyfriend is begging me to make more.

Wonderful.  I used 1 1/4 cup of flour.  I did need to bake it for about 32 minutes but they were chewy on the inside and cake like on the out side.  They took about 5 minutes to throw together too so that's definitely a plus.

Fudgy wudgy goodness.... hmmmm.  We decreased the flour as suggested and love the fudge texture.  Very chocolaty.  I also subbed mini marshmallows for the walnuts.  It was quick and easy, just like the recipe said. I was a little scared by the lack of instructions but just went with it and it worked perfectly.

I made these a couple of weeks ago as the recipe directed and made them again today, reducing the flour as previous reviewers suggested. I personally prefer the recipe with the reduced flour. Either way, they were absolutely fabulous!

EXCELLENT!  I heaped the half-cup cocoa powder, added 3/4 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of nuts, & was careful not to overbake.  This recipe is a KEEPER!

I made these with a little less flour and 3 eggs.  I cooked them in a bit smaller pan, and cooked for 30 minutes.  At the end of that time, they looked beautiful and done, even from the bottom, and seemed firm to the touch in the center,  so I didn't test them.  Big mistake!  They were basically raw, but delicious!  Really rich, I will rate them at a 5 because you can tell they will be the BEST brownies in the world when cooked properly.  Very easy to make.  Just make sure to cook them long enough!!!

This is the kind of dessert I like. Easy and chocolatey but not oversweet. Great to enjoy with a cup of tea. These don't rise too much if you use the 9 X 13" pan. I cut the flour amount to 1 generous cup, omitted the nuts but kept to the directions for everything else. Thanks!

So, so easy.  Thank you so much.  My first attempt resulted in tasty brownies, though I was wondering if I could make them more gooey....The next time I sprinkled some chocolate chips around on top.  These settled in to the brownies for a wonderful gooey surprise.  Also, try spreading some peanut butter on the top of a brownie for that "Reeses" effect.  Mmmmmmmm....

These brownies were awesome, BUT only after I nixxed 2 eggs.  Making them with only 2 eggs instead of 4 made them super fudgy and moist.  I got soooo many compliments! Thanks for the recipe.  You do have to cook them a bit longer than 30 minutes though...

these were good and very simple to make.  I also reduced the flour to 1 Cup and added 1 Cup of chocolate chips...I also added a sprinkle of cinnamon.  The day I made these I didn't care for them, but the next day they seem to have "settled" and the texture was different.  I WILL make these again (the day before I need them...).

I just baked a batch of these brownies and I am sold!  These are great!  I followed the recipe exactly and didn't decrease the flour as others did and didn't add the walnuts (too much in a hurry to bake the brownies for dessert tonight) but did have to increase the baking time to almost 45 minutes because I used a smaller pan.  I will add the nuts next time and this recipe is definitely a keeper!

My husband and I were in the mood for brownies, but didnt have any mix in the house.  I looked up this recipe and was hesitant, but decided to try it anyway.  They turned out excellent.  I took the advice of others to use only 1 cup of flour to be less cake-like. I also threw in a handful of chocolate chips along with the walnuts, and we could not stop eating these brownies.  They are all gone!  30 minutes exact.  I will no longer be buying brownie mix!

Really liked the recipe.  I added choco chips and a little coconut oil flavoring for a different twist.  Skipped the nuts.  YUMMY! Baked for 30 minutes.

I halved the recipe and cooked it in an 8x8 inch pan, and it took 20 minutes to bake. They were quite tasty, but lacks the depth that other brownies i've tasted have. Maybe it's because I used margarine, or it might be my cocoa powder...

These smelled very yummy before I baked them, but for some reason they didn't bake the way they should have, and it took 45 minutes for the middle to finish cooking and the outside was a little burnt. They are also oily, but I wonder if that is because of the margerine I used. Either way I do not like the flavor or the consistency. I will keep looking for just the right brownie recipe.

I thought it was a great cakey brownie recipe.  I didn't change and thing and they turned out great for a teacher appreciation type brunch at my son's school.  I sprinkled them with powdered sugar and piled them on a plate.  Excellent.

These were good and super easy.  I added some chocolate chips to ensure that they were chocolatey enough, and they did have to bake for about ten minutes longer than the recipe states.  But I'll make them again the next time I need a chocolate fix.

Doesn't get much easier than this.  If a 24 year-old single guy can (and does) make good brownies from scratch, it's gotta be good.

I loved it. I'm a terrible baker but this one was amazing. Some of the changes I did:
1) increased the salt by adding 3/4 tsp instead of 1/2 tsp.
2) reduced the sugar to 1 cup and it was a mixture of white sugar and brown sugar~blended a bit in a blender. 
3) baked it for 38minutes at 170°C as my oven does not have the option of 175. 
4) I LOVED IT.

We don't like sweet, sweet, so I decreased the the sugar to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup chopped Ghirardelli 60% cacao bittersweet chocolate baking chips. I used pecans instead of walnuts. I live at 4800 ft so I increased the baking powder to 1 1/2 tsp. They turned out yummy.

Turned out terribly! I think the ingredients call for too many eggs. The mix was very wet despite the amount of time I spent mixing and had to keep baking longer than 45 minutes. Ended up tossing it all out! Not using this recipes again.

Just what I needed. Cut recipe in half and used an 8x8x2 Pan with parchment.  I added Choc chips to batter. Once cooled, I melted Choc chips and drizzled with spoon over cooled Brownies.  Mmmm... Yum.

I’ve been making this recipe for years. The only change I make is I sub unrefined coconut oil for the butter. It makes the texture very rich and dense, and takes the flavor to an unbelievable level!

I'm so glad I found this recipe! I have been trying recipes from another website that kept popping up first  in search results and I am usually unimpressed with the results. Well, I thought  I would try this recipe and it came out so nicely.  I will use only 1 cup of flour next time so that they are a little less cakey, but that's it. I'm making these in bulk for the weekend so my boys can have plenty to snack on.  Thanks for the recipe.

I make this all the time.  Super yummy. I make it when a friend has a baby and always get rave reviews.  

Like other have said, I also changed to 1 1/2 cup of flour to one.  I also use oil instead of butter and chocolate chips because we don't like nuts.

Made it for the first time, and they turned out really well! I read the reviews first, and a lot of reviewers suggested cutting the flour down to just one cup so that's what I did. Brownies were nice and fudgy and had a great texture, everyone loves them!

Came out wonderful. 4 stars because they were too sweet. Saw another recipe that called for 1.5 cups of sugar to 1.5 cups of flour and that sounds just about right. Will make it next time with reduced sugar.

I loved this recipe. I had no idea "scratch" brownies could be so easy. I was scrambling for something to make for an event & had no box mix. I tried this recipe on a whim & reduced the flour as others suggested. It was a hit. I'm making them again.

It's a good recipe. This was my first time using it and it turned out great. I didn't have any butter so I used half a cup of olive oil and was a bit worried about how it would turn out, but it worked. It was very fast and easy, it took me about ten minutes to actually make it.

I added extra cocoa, 1 c walnuts, 1c mini semi sweet chocolate chips and this recipe turned out awesome.  I prefer the cake like consistency especially when adding the chips so I added all of the flour and made the recipe as written.  Baked in a glass 9x13 for the 30 minutes and they turned out perfect! Great recipe!  I'll definitely use this one again!

I (and my kids and friends) really liked these brownies. We used one cup o' flour as noted and overall it was easy to make and bake BUT I had to bake at 375 degrees for more like 45 minutes as the middle would not set otherwise.

Loved these! Used 1 cup of flour as other suggested which worked really well. Also, forgot baking powder when I first made them - they were so fudgy and wonderful (crisp edges & chewy center)! Made them again with 1/4 tsp of baking powder and will eliminate it again next time! We love fudgy as opposed to fluffy. Very good tho!

I made this recipe twice. The first time I followed the directions exactly as written and the outcome was just ok. There was definitely not enough chocolate in there for my family's taste. The second time I added 3/4 C of cocoa powder, a bit of greek yogurt to make sure it stays moist with the extra dry ingredients, and reduced the number of eggs to 3 and they were awesome. The variation will be my go to recipe for brownies. I like how quickly it comes together, and that you do not have to bother with softening the butter, or melting chocolate.

This recipe is great!! But I tweaked it just a bit. I did oil instead of butter or margarine- 1/2 cup which was a mixture of vegetable / olive oil. Then I did 2 teapsoons of vanilla. And I added Marshmallows ( small white cubes) -around 3/4 cup to 1 cup, mixed nuts ( instead of walnuts) and some honey. This was about 1/4 cup. Baked in a glass dish for 30 minutes. Super delicious and moist - Marshmallows melted on top and added extra moisture!!! Oh and I used brown sugar instead of white and 1 cup of flour as suggested.

My family loved them. Will definitely make again :)
Happy Baking everyone!

We used 1 1/2 cups of sugar, half the butter, 1/3 cup of applesauce, only 2 eggs, and 1 cup of flour.  I also added a couple of tablespoons of dark choc cocoa powder as well.  We only had to bake for around 25 minutes in a 9X12 glass pan.  The brownies were a big hit with kids and adults.  We will certainly make this recipe again!

Did the recipe just as it's stated however, I added chopped chocolate as well as chocolate chips and left out the nuts. I was in the mood for cake-like brownies and this recipe delivered. Very good and made a ton of them. I cut mine up a lot smaller than they must have because I got a lot more than 20 out of it. Would use this recipe again.

Overall, these "brownies" tasted good. However, I put quotes around the word 'brownies' because they, honestly, were not at all like brownies. They were definately much more just like a regular chocolate cake, and did not at all have the rich, fudgy, rich chocolatey taste that all good brownies need. It was a chocolatey taste, but not that rich, super- chocolatey taste that quality brownies need. But if you're looking for a plain chocolate cake recipe, this would be good. These just were not brownies, at all- it was most certainly just a cake.

The oldest review I saw was in 2001 and now its 2014 and this recipe is still famous. This is one of the easiest and quickest brownie recipe to make. I enjoyed making it and they turned out great. I have made it many times and didn't think it was necessary to change anything because as the title says "quick and easy" so I don't understand why people changed it. 5/5 stars, taste great

I did the recipe exactly as stated. Turned out cakey (super delicious) but my bake time was 45 minutes. Not sure why! My husband was very impressed I "made them from scratch!"

I made these today exactly how it's written (left the walnuts out, didn't have any).  My husband and I just had one with coffee, and let me tell you, they are delicious!  My husband loved them too and said he wouldn't change a thing...i will be making these from now on, they are so easy to make and good, and I'm trying to make more things from scratch, hate all the additives in box mixes.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

I replaced white sugar with brown sugar; cut the butter a bit and used 2-3 tablespoon of peanut butter instead of walnut. Also tried the same by reducing the flour to 1 cup, as other reviewers suggested. both works perfectly

The first time I made these, I wanted fudge brownies, so I used two eggs and then two egg yolks. The brownies came out perfect and moist. The second time I made these, I did not have enough butter, so I pureed prunes and water and replaced the one cup of butter with one cup of the pureed prunes. I used whole wheat flour, and I used two eggs and two egg yolks also.  The brownies came out more like a chocolate bread, which I didn't mind, as it was made out of whole wheat and prunes.

I haven't tried cutting back on the flour. Made them twice now with special dark cocoa powder. Added chocolate chunks the first time and they were WONDERFUL. Will be trying it without in about 20 minutes... ;-)

I used almost one cup of flour and only 2 eggs. This turned out great!! really chewy and very chocolatey. I've read about 50 comments on this recipe both the good ones and the bad ones for suggestions on toggling this recipe and I am so glad I did!! I love them!!
Although they do deserve only 4 stars since the recipe is altered in order to get this amazing brownie.

These were perfect for quick and easy brownies.  I went strictly by the recipe and they were very good.  Next time I may add some instant coffee to 'kick it up a notch', but this recipe is good as it is.

I've tried a lot of brownie recipes and usually I'm somewhat let down with the promised results. Not only are these simple to put together and bake, they turn out well, also. I halved the recipe and baked in an 8 inch glass Pyrex dish for about twenty five minutes, just until I could smell the aroma of baking brownie! I used a Dutch process cocoa (organic) and otherwise followed the directions. When they came out of the oven I placed some semi-sweet chocolate chips on the top and spread over the brownies as the chips melted, this formed a thin layer of icing that amped up the taste a bit. The texture was fantastic, sort of cake-y yet fudgy, yum. I can see where some may be let down by the mild flavor but this makes the recipe great for add-ins like nuts or flavored chips. Can't go wrong with this one!

Good recipe. I only used 1 cup of flour and these were still very cakey brownies. I omitted the nuts and added cacao nibs instead.

I made these and reduced the flour to 1 cup as suggested. I added 1Tsp extra cocoa and 1/4 cup choc chips. This made them chewy, strong flavored and less 'cakelike' than they would ordinarily have been. My family LOVVVVVED them. I'll never make brownies any other way.

Yum! Used 1 cup flour and 3 eggs, baked for 22 minutes, came out great! With about 5 minutes to go I added mini marshmellows and graham cracker crumbs to the top... Delicious.

Even though I changed the recipe, I am giving this 5 starts.  Why?  Because it's the best recipe to start from.  If you like a cake like texture keep it as it is.  Read many of the reviews and it will be a snap to customize the recipe to get exactly what you want.  I took suggestions from a few reviews.  First I like very chocolatey, fudge-like brownies and since eggs make things "cake-like" reduced eggs to 2.  Reduced flour to 1 cup.  Increased cocoa to 3/4 cup.  Holy Cow!!  I'm in love! Can't wait to try again with the suggestion of adding instant coffee to increase the complexity of the flavor!  This was definitely the absolute easiest recipe ever!  OH!  And my tip to add - cut them when they're still warm for an even, more appealing looking cut.  Otherwise the crunchy outside breaks up.  They're firm on the outside and gooey on the inside.  (Because I used a smaller pan).

recipe really is quick and easy came out right my first try. Only added 1 cup of flour and also cut half the butter out and added 1/2 cup apple sauce. Easy recipe to customize did not add nuts but I will add nuts and peanut butter chips next time....yummm.

I made half a batch of these but I substituted 3/4 of the butter for Peanut Butter instead. I also threw in a handful of chocolate chips. They turned out moist with the perfect hint of peanut butter flavor. I definitely recommend trying this way.

i TRIPPLE (!) the cocoa and use about 50g less flour and sugar based on 20 servings. i also add a large sprinkle of cocoa granuales at the end. Once cooked - approx 40 mins on 200c (in my fab oven!) they are sticky and amazingly chocolatey! yum!

I have no idea what i am doing wrong here! I made a batch of 20 servings and it burnt after 15 minutes and completely destroyed a pan! Just made another batch for 5 servings and it again burnt :S followed this recipe to the letter and it's just not working for me and have no idea why. Never had this trouble with a recipe off here before so really confused :(

Great recipe, I also added just 1 cup of flour. I didn't add cocoa powder and added extra vanilla, so I got very good blondies. The blondies are also good with 1/2 cup of chocolate chips mixed in.

I found this to be almost a perfect match to my dad's brownies. I cut back on the butter to 3/4c for cake brownies but left it for the fudge type. Awesome!

Good brownies, just a few changes. Since I didn't want to make a full batch, I reduced all ingredients by half and added 2 Tbsps of creamy peanut butter and baked for about 35 minutes in an 8x8 pan. Next time, I might use 1/2 cup of cocoa, as required in the original recipe since I added the peanut butter, which does distract from the chocolate flavor (as mentioned in a previous comment). Or, I could just use 1 Tbsp of peanut butter....It's still a very good recipe and there is no need to buy brownie mix anymore since I already have the ingredients in my pantry.

i have a couple things to say first username: Stevie lee that cocoa powder that you mentioned usually drys my baking stuff out so i would be careful on how much you use and what you use it in. also these brownies are amazing! and easy to make very fast.

Success can be measured when I offer my husband one and he asks for a second. He asks for a third and later I caught him stealing two more! I recalculated it for 30 servings, used unbleached wheat flour; adding 1/4 cup less of what the recipe asked for and the eggs were from cage free hens. Yummy!

Made these tonight to share at work tomorrow. They're delicious! I didn't have any vanilla, so I substituted with Almond extract, and I used coconut sugar instead of white. Tasty tasty! And very quick to make!

They tasted great, and I did reduce the flour to one cup ... but I'm not sure if it's my oven or the 4 eggs or what but they were a little too moist/fudgy for my taste. I probably would have actually liked the "cakey" as-is recipe. So since it was a user error, I'm giving this one 5 stars anyway. :)

I tried it today for my moms birthday. I would usually buy the mix because it is easier but this recipe was great and easy. I didnt use any walnut halves because I really dont like them and some friends are allergic. I am for sure going to make it again.

Fantastic! Had a craving for brownies and this was super easy to make.  I added a handful of chocolate chips to it and realized that I forgot an put in the full amount of flour instead of cutting back like others suggested.  I added a handful of chocolate melts to see if it would thin it out a little but it didn't.  I baked in a glass dish and it came out BEAUTIFULLY!!!! Tastes awesome!!!!

I said 5*, DH said 3* (to him, it tasted more like a gooey cookie than a brownie which was what he was expecting).  Personally, I thought they were great - my favorite recipe for brownies off AR thusfar.  Only change was to use 3 eggs instead of 4 and 1/2 cup of chocolate chips instead of nuts.  Oh - I also used coffee extract instead of vanilla.  I was quite pleased and will certainly make again.

This is such an easy recipe. But in my opinion one of the best. I made this recipe twice. Once with 1 1/2 cup like suggested in the recipe and once with just 1 cup. I myself prefer it with 1 1/2 cups of flour. Anyways, CHEERS!!!

I found these brownies very "eggy" (chewy - and not in a good way) and far too salty. I keep wondering if I did something wrong, but I've looked at the recipe over and over. Disappointing.

These are delicious brownies.  Very quick & easy and really cheaper than buying the "boxed" kind.  Made them for my local fire fighters and they LOVED them!!  Already asking for a second batch.  Will definately keep this in my recipe box and pass out to my friends.  Thanks for the GREAT recipe

Delicious! My daughter and I were craving a tasty treat this afternoon and this hit the nail on the head. She says they taste just like the little round ones we buy at the store. I also cutback the flour but followed the rest of the recipe. It took about 40 minutes to cook in a 8x11.5 glass pan.

I cheated a little to make these great.  I added some non dairy cream to help round out the cocoa.  Only used 3 eggs.  Used 1c wheat flour, 1 cup sugar and 4 sugar substitute packets.  Turned out amazing!  My hubby doesn't like nuts so, on "my" half, I put coconut, pecans and mini chocolate chips.  Made the brownies even more amazing!!

Yes!! This recipe was indeed quick and easy. It was good that the instructions were brief... I made this while friends were over, and it was simple enough to focus on them and not the recipe! I added two handfuls of chocolate chips too, just to make it extra awesome! =D Thanks C. Nelson!!

I wish i could add more stars, i love these brownies. My kids enjoy making them with me and we all enjoy eating them. Even my husband who doesn't eat many sweets had to have seconds. I do tinker with recipes, so sometimes i go a little heavier on the cocoa, but they are already perfect :)

I made these for co-workers over the weekend.  I made some changes like everyone, but the basis of the recipe is fantastic!  Everyone raved about them, so without further adieu...Here's my go to recipe for from scratch frownies. :)

1 c. Brown Sugar
3/4 c. White Sugar
1/4 c. Powdered sugar 
3/4 c. Cocoa Powder
1. tsp Vanilla
4 Eggs
1 1/2 Cups Flour
1/2 tsp. baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 C. Semi-Sweet Morsels

Melt butter, beat sugars for a few minutes, so the brown is well incorporated.  No one likes grainy brown sugar.  I followed the rest and scraped down the sides a few times in the kitchen aid.  Thanks again because it was my first time making scratch brownies and these were a HUGE hit!

Delicious-these were a big hit.  The only change I made was using semisweet chocolate chips instead of walnuts.  Thanks for an easy, fantastic dessert!

Instead of walnuts I added a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. After pouring the batter in the pan I topped it with a cream cheese topping...this is the topping (trust me it takes this brownie to a whole nother level:
8 ounces cream cheese, softened
1/4 cup sugar
1 egg
1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract
Mix it all together in a separate bowl and pour over the top swirling it into the brownie batter.

These were sooo decadent!

I've never made brownies before, but decided to give this a try end of last week and i'm glad i did because they're delicious and my husband loves them! He wants me to show him how i make it some time!
I only used 1 cup of flour after reading other reviews and I used 1 teaspoon of honey instead of vanilla extract, as I didn't have any, plus being a Muslim, there may be ingredients in vanilla extract that may not be permissible for me to use. My only complaint is that despite baking it at 350 degrees Fahrenheit, it took 50 minutes to bake. 
Next time, i'll half the recipe since only me and my husband will be eating it (there were plenty of leftovers and there still are!), but it's a very easy recipe and i'm glad i found it! This is the first recipe i've tried out on here! Will hopefully try out more!
Update: made this again today after a chocolate cake broke apart when taking it out of the cake tin (no idea why!), but halved the quantity and left out the nuts which made a big difference to the taste and texture! It was more chocolatey and fudge-like, whereas last time it had more of a cake-like texture. My brother in law said, 'oh my God this is amazing!' and he actually thought I made it differently! My husband hasn't tried them yet, but I know he'll prefer the brownies this time too, although he did love the ones with nuts as well. This one's definitely going in my recipe book!

These brownies are super easy and super yummy!! I made them as cupcake brownies and put a mini piece of chocolate candy or chocolate bar from my kid's halloween candy in the middle before baking. They loved the sweet suprise in the middle!!

Absolutely yummy, easy and surprisingly quick! I even used less flour and more sugar and cocoa, and added 2 sf of chocolate sprinkles. It was great. My husband says it's not really a brownie (he likes it extra soft and moist) but nonetheless, he ate half the pan !!

Delicious, easy, and quick. I loved it. The changes I would make would be to also use only one cup of flour and use only two eggs. The more eggs the more cake like results, and I prefer fudge like brownies. Scrumptdillious!

These came out really good and were SO easy to make. I took the advice of others and cut down on the flour to 1 cup. These do come out more like cake than like those hard thick brownies you may be looking for, so keep that in mind. Overall, though, very tasty!

This was a good, basic recipe. I only added 1 cup of flour like the other reviewers said, added 1/4 cup extra coco powder and used chopped semi-sweet bakers chocolate instead of nuts.. however, I cooked them in a cupcake pan for individual portions. I ended up having enough for two batches, 12 in the first and 6 in the second. The first batch ended up like cupcakes in both taste and texture, the bottom was also slightly over cooked. The the 6 remaining I decided to  reduce the heat to 300. The 6 turned out more like brownies than the first 12. Since I was making them for a birthday party, I decided that another batch was needed and I decided to change the recipe even more. I added 1 tbs of canola oil and 3 ounces of bakers chocolate, along with more 1/4 cup more coco powder. OMG... so good and so moist!!!

I used heshey's chocolate syrup instead of cocoa powder and reduced the sugar to one cup. I left out the vanilla extract, salt, and walnuts. I also reduced the flour to one cup. It turned out more like cake  than brownies.

Quick, easy, and perfectly delicious.  I made this recipe and followed the directions exactly.  It came out wonderfully, a mix between cake-like and fudge-like, which suits my tastes.  It has amazing chocolate flavor, too!

They are not bad, but I have had better. It doesn't have a lot of chocolate flavour, and I don't really like the texture of the brownies. I do like the walnuts in it.

I did not care for this recipe. it's the first time I've been misled by this site's ratings.  I tried 2 batches to be sure I didn't screw something up, but there's no doubt that you can buy Ghiradelli box brownies and beat these by about a mile.  They are not chocolatey enough and the texture is bad - even with less flour as suggested.

This recipe is a keeper for sure. I made it for a cook out with some friends (10 adults and 3 kids), and everybody LOVED it, and was raving about it. I did make a small change after reading other reviews and used only 1 cup of flour, as suggested. It turned out as a melt-in-you-mouth brownie. I'm making it again today for a dinner invite. Thank you for this recipe :)))

I had only one egg and found a website that suggested flax meal/baking powder/water as a substitute. I thought it would probably be a bust, but how bad could brownies be, right? I also used whole wheat flour (full amount--didn't see the advice from others until after they were in the oven). You know what? They are the best brownies I have ever made. And yes, super easy.

I was very pleased with this recipe. In between cake like a fudgey with these changes. I used 1 1/2 cup flour, only 3 eggs, 2 tsp vanilla and 2/3 cup cocoa powder for more chocolatey flavor.

Reduced flour to one and a fourth cup, added two teaspoons of coffee, an extra tablespoon of chocolate, a heaping tablespoon of brown sugar, only two eggs. A major hit!

I would still prefer to use a box mix.  I love moist fudgy brownies, but these did not fully disappoint.  I made them since I had ingredients on hand, but if I had a choice I would still use box for the flavour and consistency that I love.

Un-be-freaking-lievable.  Didn't have a cup of butter on hand, so I used 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup canola oil.  Other than that, made it as written.  Totally awesome.  Will NEVER buy a mix again.

Im not a pro brownie baker but I was needing a quick  nighttime snack lastnight. Can't get much easier then a 1 bowl 5 min prep time.  I love reading the comments and did reduce the flower by a little. I eyeballed it. They wer a little like cake but good. I sprinkled some frozen raspberries over about 1/10th of them before cooking. Wish I put more in! Moister and great addition;)

Who knew it could be so easy?  I didn't have enough butter so I used 1/2 of coconut oil and the consistency was great but it definitely changed the taste.  I think with all butter like the recipe calls for would be perfect.  I LOVE brownies.  I'll be playing with this one to see how I can keep the original taste and make it even healthier.

this recipe was amazing! :) whipped these up in about an hour(so fast and easy), i read the reviews and used only 1 cup of flour. i also took some mini chocolates chips dusted in a about a tablespoon of flour and sprinkled them on top of the brownies once they were spread in the pan. Came out exactly as expected, delicious!

These are good, but even with only a cup of flour they are cake-like brownies.

well, it must be me;  this is the third brownie recipe i've tried off this website, and the third disaster in a row...these, to their credit, were less of a disaster than the other ones, but a disaster nonetheless...how can people possibly be giving these 5 stars???  they are revoltingly sweet with no chocolate flavor, and are oily beyond all words to tell it...plus, they don't rise meaning i ended up with a pan of 1/2 inch high greasy sort-of-chocolate crackers...forget it:  i'll buy box mixes...what a waste of ingredients

This recipe was just what I was looking for. It is quick and easy just like the name says. I changed nothing! This was by far the best recipe for homemade brownies I have ever tried! I did not think that they turned out "cakey" like other reviewers said. We started eating them HOT out of the oven! Perfect, make sure to check them though mine took an extra 10 min to bake, so the total bake time was 40 min, but other than that no problems!

I followed the recipe exactly.  These were a little sweeter than I care for, but good.  I prefer my brownies to taste more like chocolate and less like sugar.  They make cakey brownies, so be sure to have icing on hand and don't bother making these if you want fudgey brownies.

I used this recipe when making a batch of pillow cookies (chocolate chip cookies with brownies inside) and not only were they the perfect compliment to the cookie, they were terrific on their own! There were plenty of leftover brownie slices and my friends had a tough time deciding if they wanted the pillow cookies or just the brownies! In most cases, they took both, little piggies :P

These brownies were great.  The only changes I made were to cut the flour to 1 cup and add chocolate chips.  They took 1 hour to bake in a 9 X 9 spring form pan.  The brownie lovers in my family all felt these were cakey or lacking in chocolate flavor.  Nice, dense, decadent and very chocolatey.  Did I mention easy?  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Add chocolate chips and walnuts.  I like the cakey texture, but if you want more of a "brownie" just add 1 c of flour instead of 1 1/2.

This was my first attempt at brownies. The recipe is really good as is; I didn't make any changes. One end of my batter ended up thicker than the other. This meant I had to bake it longer than stated, but it's probably my fault. I'm not sure what happened, but I ate a brownie off of the thinner end and it was delicious. I can't wait to share these with my husband (if there are any left when he gets home!)

Made this recipe exactly as listed.  Excellent, moist brownies.  I might try adding more cocoa powder next time I make it, not because it's lacking but because you can almost never have too much chocolate.

These were truly amazingly delicious.  I haven't had particularly good luck with home made brownies but these were as good or better than ones made out of a box.  I used a heaping cup of flour.  They were perfect.

These are delicious.  They are not a thick, chocolately brownie, but they are good.  Similar to a box mix, but lighter.  Very quick to make.  I used 1 cup flour as other reviewers suggested.  In the oven they looked thick and cake like, but once they cooled, they were not cake like at all.  Not chewy either.

If you have 45 minutes I suggest driving to the store for a mix instead of making these.  Even my seven year old did not like them and he would eat any brownie.  They were cakey (great if that if your thing) and tasteless....unless you like the taste of egg.  I used a cup of flour too like others had suggested and they still were not good.

Beware of these brownies. They are so good they will not stick around for long. Like others, I cut the flour down to one cup and it made it more "brownie" like. I also added about 1 cup of dark chocolate chips. My son and his work mates love these and I have a standing order for these for every week.

I was making these for a Super Bowl party, and these are definitely better than Brook's Bombshell Brownies, but I think I will still search for a different recipe.  The first batch I made turned out wrong.  The cocoa powder in the batter balled up.  I went ahead and baked them to see how they would be, and they are edible, but I left them for my family to eat.  The second batch I tweaked to try and avoid that problem with the cocoa powder.  Here's what I did:  I used 1/2 c. butter and 1/2 c. applesauce.  I beat that in with the sugar, and then beat the 4 eggs and vanilla extract into the mix.  In a separate bowl I combined the cocoa powder, salt, 1 c. of flour, and the baking powder.   I stirred the dry ingredients together, and then gradually added it into the wet ingredients.  There were no lumps, and then I baked it in the oven for about 40 minutes.  They came out fine, but they're nothing spectacular.  For my own personal preference, I would make these a day ahead of time because they seem to get fudgier tasting overnight.

Great recipe!  I made a few changes to make it a little bit healthier.  Substituted 1/2 cup of the butter with unsweetened applesauce and used white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose.  I followed other people's suggestions and reduced the flour to 1 cup.  I also added a touch of cinnamon.  It was pretty sweet so I think next time I'll reduce the sugar to 1.5 cups and see how it turns out.  Very easy recipe and turned out delicious fudgy brownies that my daughter's entire first grade class including her teachers LOVED!

I am in a "brownie throwdown" next week, so I have been trying new recipes to decide which one to use.  (My family is growing tired of brownies).  I have one more to try, or this recipe is going to be the winner.  It definitely fits the title.  These were quick and easy and use common ingredients.  They turned out moist and fudgy and are so far the only brownie recipe that I have liked more the the boxed brownies.  This one's a keeper.

I followed the recipe exactly besides adding pecans instead of walnuts and we loved it. My family likes a more cakelike brownie and this one was great!

I wish I could add more stars just because they came out perfect & the recipe actually was easy! I used to be one of those people who would rather use the boxed stuff because it was just 'easier' but this recipe proves me wrong. Prep time was just about 5 minutes and they smelled heavenly while they cooked - and tasted even better. Definitely a good recipe to start on if you've never done anything from scratch.

This was my first time making brownies from scratch. I followed the suggestions of others and only used 1c of flour. I also omitted the nuts as a personal preference. The first batch I ran out of butter and had to use 1/2c of margarine - these turned out good. The second batch I was a little more prepared and used the full cup of butter that the recipe calls for - holy batman! My second batch was way better. The brownies had more crustiness to them and came out perfect. Thanks for this recipe...I'll make sure to always have butter on hand if I plan to make these

I loved these brownies! For me, they didn't come out fudgy and thick, but I liked them the way they came out, anyways. Because it's cocoa powder, it's much easier to make with the cost of depth in chocolate flavor. My family isn't into the overly sweet sweets, so this was PERFECT for us. I substituted some of the butter with apple sauce.. about 3 or 4 tbs for a more healthy alternative. It didn't change the taste or texture much. Also, I only used 1 cup of flour. These were chocolatey, but not overly sweet.. just the way I love my brownies :-)

I loved this quick and easy recipe! For my altitude (above 3000 feet) I added two tablespoons of Hershey's chocolate, one tablespoon of brewed coffee, and only 1 1/3 cups of flour.  They also had to cook for 35 minutes. So delicious though!

So yum! I add chocolate chips and chunks of milk chocolate to make them even better! I also did as other reviewers suggested and halfed the flour in order to make the brownies more moist and less cake like.

This is a very easy delicious brownie recipe! The brownies came out thick and very chocolaty within the given time frame. They are however very cake-like. But considering how quickly they can be made, I'm willing to settle for less chewy brownies.

This is the best brownie recipe I've used. They turned out amazing. I opted out of using walnuts, but instead I melted peanut butter and chocolate with a double boiler and drizzled that on top. Amazing! Really moist, rich and delicious!

It's true, they are quick and easy and delicious. I too cut back the flour to 1 1/4 cups and next I will cut down to 1 cup next time to make them more dense. I read where one reviewer added cinnamon and cayenne. I like that idea and will try it. Love these brownies.

I LOVE this brownie recipe!!! I reduced the flour to 1 cup = Yummy, gooey brownies! I also like to experiment with add-in ingredients on this recipe. I crushed Snicker bars to add into this recipe (about 1/2 cup) and top the baked brownies with caramel sauce. Great crowd-pleaser!!!

Very good recipe!  The only reason I'm not giving it the full 5 is because it took over an hour to bake.  But they tasted great.  I took other's suggestion and only used 1 cup of flour.

Flat as a pancake. Didn't cook in the middle but overcooked on the edges. I followed to recipes exactly (expect only using 1 cup of flour as other reviewers suggested). My baking soda is good, so I'm not sure what happened...

Followed others advice on the flour and they are wonderful. There can be so many variations on these...I'm anxious to try they out again.

I replaced the butter with 1 cup of applesauce and I only used 1 cup of flour instead of 1 1/2 cups.  I also replaced the walnuts with semi-sweet chocolate chips (nut allergies). They are moist and delicious, and stay that way for several days!

Easy recipe, the family enjoyed the brownies. They came out cake-like so if that's the style brownie you're going for, this is a great recipe. I personally prefer the heavier, stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth type so I'll be experimenting with some other recipes.

Very good!  I loved the consistancy and flavor-- I used 1 1/4c flour but followed the rest exactly.  Not too sweet-- just perfect.

This is an awesome starter recipe.  I've made it about 4 times now.  I always add things like chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, reeses peices, m&ms, etc.  I have no idea how the recipe tastes as is since I always add something.  I followed others' advice to down the flour and sugar and up the cocoa powder and am glad I did.

OMG these brownies were incredible!  I made them in a 9x9 pan and I think a 9x13 would have been better...the middle took too long to get done and the ends were a bit crunchier than I would have liked.  Also, I did only use 1 cup of flour and I think maybe I'll try 1¼ cups next time.  

Update:

The first time I made these, I put the mint frosting on top from another recipe.  The second time I did these just as the recipe instructed and liked them less.  They aren't very sweet and tasted more like cake.  I'm trying another recipe and probably won't make these again.

LOVE IT! It tastes absolutely divine. I reduced the flour to 1 cup as suggested by others, and I omitted the nuts (because I didn't have any.) I also served it warm with chocolate ganache and dessicated coconut. YUM!

These are amazing! They taste exactly like the 2 bite brownies as long as you reduce the flour to 1 cup and the sugar to 1.5cups :) People gobbled these up at Christmas dinner! I'm making them again right now for the kids treat for at school (sans walnuts of course)!

These brownies are really good!  I took the other users' suggestions by using only 3 eggs and using only 1 cup of flour.  For more of a rich chocolatey flavor, I melted 1 square of unsweetened Baker's chocolate in with the butter and it's a very fudgy and deep chocolate brownie.

Deciding to make brownies at the last minute on Valentine's Day but not wanting to go to the store due to a ground blizzard led me to searh for "easy brownies" and wah lah these came up first.  They sure lived up to their name and I was really pleased with the results.  I did add in some chocolate chips to the mix and a bit of oil and used one less egg as many reviews suggested.  I'll make these again for sure when I want something sweet and homemade but really quick and easy.  Thanks for the recipe.

These brownies were delicious and QUICK to make. I already had the ingredients on hand. I did do a few extra kicks to it, I used 3 instead of 4 eggs so the batter wouldn't be so cakey as others (Grab 2 small mixing bowls). In one small mixing bowl soften 1-8oz pkg of cream cheese, mix it with 1cup powder (confectioners)sugar, 1-egg and 1-teaspoon of Vanilla extract. In the other bowl take 1/2 cup of peanut butter (add apx. 1 1/2 to 2 tsp of softened butter, to help with the spreading consistentcy.) By the teaspoonfuls drop on top of the brownie batter that is in baking pan, alternating cream cheese filling with peanut butter one. take a butter knife or skewer (which ever is avl.) and swirl it through the brownie batter.  I recommend going straight down the long way about 5x's, then 6x's width wise. It's DEEELICIOUS!!! It's like a choc. cream cheese & Peanut Butter brownie all in one! My sons & husband loved them!!! I made it for or small Superbowl 44 home gatering but, with 2 teen an adolecent and Husband, there was not much to share with friends and family when they stopped by. (They did wrap up one for our Pastor. Thank GOD :D!) Don't double the receipe all at once. Make one batch then another. (The consistency of this batter you don't want to try doubling up front. The sugar crystals in the batter will make you think something didn't come out right but, it bakes just fine. If you add the toppings I suggested up your cooking time about 10-12 more mins.) ENJOY!!!

I followed the suggestions from other reviewers and cut down the flour to 1 cup and added a tablespoon of sour cream.  I am not a chocaholic, but I found them lacking in chocolate flavor.  Also, the first bite tasted surprisingly eggy.  This is a cake-like brownie. I hadn't really thought about it, but I think I discovered I prefer a more dense brownie.  This is no fault of the recipe; just a personal preference.  If I had left the recipe as written, it probably would have been more dense, but it still wouldn't have been chocolatey enough for us.  Nevertheless, it's nice to have a simple recipe you can pull out of your hat in a moment's notice.  So, I probably wouldn't make them again....but I'm sure this recipe would suit lots of people just fine.

These are really good!! I would use a smaller pan nexxt time to get a thicker brownie but the taste is so chocolately good : ) I did as others suggested and only added 1 cup of flour. It is a lot of butter I wish there was a good low fat recipe for these.

The day I made these, I though that they were just okay. Then I tried them a day later and they were better. I think that if I were going to make this recipe again, I would follow the other reviewers suggestions and add less flour and fewer eggs.

Delicious, and very easy. I used 1 cup of flour as suggested by other reviewers because my family likes their brownies fudge-like. Also omitted the nuts. I needed to revise my rating from 5 to 4 stars because I accidentally made these the 2nd time using the prescribed 1 1/2 cups of flour and they turned out rather dry. They are a 5-star recipe with just 1 cup of flour, but as written they are barely a 4-star.

This recipe was easy to follow and my guests liked it but I honestly thought it was too dry and not chocolatey enough. I would not suggest using this recipe if you're looking for a fudgy brownie.

Start by melting the butter in the bowl that you want to mix the other ingredients in... just add the other ingredients in order, as it says... could not be easier or taste better!

Not what I expected... The directions leave to much to chance. I cooked mine for at least 40 minutes and they are still a little undercooked. They taste good though. I replaced the walnuts with three different kinds of chocolate chips: mini semi sweet, milk choc chips, and white choc chips. Half a cup equal parts of all three. But I'm still working on the time. I have a square non stick and I think it's messing with my results a little. I might try a higher heat of 375 next time.

My husband rates this as 5 stars, but for me, i thought it was much to cakey. It was very tasty but I was expecting a dense gooey brownie. I even cut down the flour to one cup as others suggested. I also piled on cinnamon with a splash of cayenne pepper for a kick.

These were pretty good and very simple. I am a real novice at baking, but I found these brownies to be easy to put together.  I also used only 1 cup of flour, which gave them a great fudgey texture, and I left out the walnuts as I was baking for a large party and wanted to avoid nut allergy issues.  That being said, it seemed like something was missing.  If you decide to leave out the nuts, be sure to add more cocoa powder or maybe even some chocolate chips to give the brownies a fuller flavor. However, even though I thought they were lacking something, they were a big hit at the party!

This was NOT quick or easy. We followed the recipe and put only 1 cup flour like so many other reviewers suggested. It has taken over an hour to bake because it turned into a lava-type mixture, and now we are left with burnt chewy tar. We now have to resort to chocolate ice cream for desert and will NEVER follow this recipe again.

These brownies turn out perfect every time if you only use one cup of flour.  I used margarine once instead of butter and the flavor was off so be sure to use real butter.  I usually mix in half a bag of semi sweet chocolate chips then sprinkle the rest on top before baking which makes them extra yummy.

These brownies were a disappointment. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out too cakey and slightly dry, and not at all chocolatey.

I decreased the flour to 1 cup and am so glad I did! I think they would have been too dry with the full amount. but watch out!! these cooked for a full 50 minutes in my oven-after 30 minutes the inside of the pyrex still looked like jello pudding :( so much for quick!

Can you say Mini Brownie Cupcake Bites! Per other reviews, I used only 1 cup of flour. I did add a bit more cocoa, and used 1 cup of veg oil (didn't have butter!). For the mini's I had my oven at 350 degrees and baked them for 15min. Got a chewy-gooey lil' brownie bite! Perfection! Oh! Just make sure you keep an eye on them if you're going to try this, my oven is an old thing so baking time will vary.

These were definitely quick and easy, they were a hit at work. Other reviewers were right, it is a bit too cake-like, that is probably because of the baking powder. Other than that they were tasty. I subbed about a half cup of whole wheat flour and half cup of Splenda, then I put York bites on top.

Good chewy brownie, not too cake-like and not dry at all. I also reduced the flour to 1 c. and added an extra 2 Tb cocoa powder--more chocolate can never hurt! And I halfed the salt, as I do in most recipes. Try this recipe if you want a brownie that is somewhere between cake-like and fudgy.

I too added a 1 cup cocoa and used only 1 1/4 cup flour.  And added about 15 min to the cooking time.  These brownies were perfect and I don't think they're going to last very long.  Will for sure make again.  Thanks for sharing:)

I love brownies probably more than any food, and it's hard for me to give any brownie recipe less than 5 stars. But I must be honest and say that these were not as rich and chewey as I expected after reading the other reviews. They tasted more sugary than chocolatey to me. Mine were not very dark brown either. I would double the cocoa next time.  Ok, I had to come back and revise my rating. These brownies were far better the next morning after they cooled. I did use only 1 cup of flour like others recommended since I don't like my brownies cakey. They were cakey and bland right out of the oven, but great once they cooled off!!!

As written, this recipe is very very dry and too cakey. I, like many others, use only 1 cup of flour. I also sometimes use 3/4 c. of sweetened coconut, 3/4 cup of chocolate chips (Nestle's swirled white and milk choc. chips are fab!), and 1/2 c. chopped walnuts! Fabulous German Chocolate cake like brownies!

Perfect brownies! Followed recipe exactly except I cut the flour to 1 c per other reviews. My boyfriend LOVED them, and he hates sweet stuff. He took them to work today and they were devoured. Just the right amt of fudginess. Thank you for this great recipe!

These brownies were a genuine hit.  Like some other reviewers, I only used 1 cup of flour instead of the 1 1/2 the recipe called for, and the brownies turned out great.  If you like your brownies on the dryer side, use the full 1 1/2 cups, but if you're like me, and like the gooier brownies, use 1 cup.  This is now my go-to brownie recipe!

I knew these were going to be awesome when the batter was so good I wanted to drink it! I made a half batch and followed the recipe exactly (with the exception of adding more vanilla because I always add more vanilla to everything)and they turned out just fine. I made them in a 8x8 glass pan. These were sooo easy and sooo delicious! As others have said, I will not be buying brownie mix again because this was way too easy and so much better!

thought these brownies were great! I wish I would have read the reviews before making them and adding a little less flour, as they turned out a little cakey.  They are still delicious, I just like them a little more dense and not so airy.  Good recipe though, next time I will try with less flour!

These were great! Very chocolaty, and nice crispy edges. I followed the other reviews, and only used 1 cup of flour. HOWEVER, I did find them to be very, 'eggy'. Maybe I could try with less egg, or all the flour? Not exactly the chewy dense brownie I am looking for.  They are great though, very nice, light, fluffy and that is why I am giving it all the stars, good, just not what I am looking for specifically.  I would make them again though.  Thanks so much.

Fantastic. These are now MY brownies. For just a little extra uuummph, I add a handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips, chopped pecans, and a ribbon of caramel. Turtle brownies!  You can make the caramel while putting all of the ingredients in the mixer. 13 caramel candies + 2.5 oz evaporated milk: microwave on low stirring occasionally until bubbling.

My husband said these were the best brownies he's ever had.  I made a few alterations:  only 1 cup of flour, 1 stick of butter and 1 apple sauce cup, 3 eggs (1 large and 2 extra large).  I also melted peanut butter and a little butter together, added a splash of vanilla and a little powdered sugar and swirled the PB mixture on top. YUMMMMY!

I only used a cup of sugar as that was all I had on used just over a cup of flour and ended up cooking it for about 45 minutes in and 8 x 8 square pan. It turned out super chocolatey, but still a little cakey, I just wish I had icing sugar to make icing because a fudgy icing would be tastey on this.

"Quick and Easy" is an accurate name, and the brownies were pretty darned good.  Not "to die for" or spectacular, but they were good, tasty, fast, and satisfied my chocolate craving.    I, too, reduced the flour down to 1 cup.  I used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup Splenda, only because we were really low on sugar and not going shopping for a few days.

These are amazing!  My husband is an avowed brownie hater, but when I made these he decided to try them and he loved them!  The first batch I made was gone in less than a day.  I used 1 cup of flour as suggested by other reviewers and cooked them in a 9x9 pan because I like my brownies thick.  It took 50 minutes to cook them.

I don't know what happened, followed the recipe to a "T" and what came out was just not what I think a brownie should be. Very cakey, not enough chocolate...I will continue my search for the perfect brownie :(

I tried this recipe for the first time and although they were easy to make, they were very very cakelike and, not nearly enough chocolate flavor.  I will try to make this again but, will increase the amount of chocolate and probably lessen the number of eggs.

I used this brownie recipe to make a 'crust' for Brownie Caramel Cheesecake, rather than a box mix.  I scaled it back to 15 servings so I didn't have too much batter for my 10 inch springform pan.  If I'm just eating a plain brownie I prefer a fudgier one, but the taste was not to rich for what I was using it for and the texture was just right to hold up as a crust without being too chewy.  I would use this recipe again for this purpose, but stick to the One Bowl Brownies for just eating plain.

Quick and Easy? YES! Moist and sweet and absolutely perfect? YES! I love brownies. On any given day, I would rather buy a box of mix than cook them from scratch. But this was completely worth the little bit of time and clean up. I will keep making this recipe. Totally worth it! You should make them...

I figured since I make these all the time I should probably review the recipe.  So easy and so quick!  They always disappear before they are completely cooled.  I line my pan with parchment paper so that I don't have to grease the pan... or clean it either!  Mine always take about 28 minutes to get that balance of cakey and chewy.  I am not sure why other reviewers struggle with the recipe.  It is extremely straight forward.  The "cakeyness" that some complain of is probably due to the type of flour they are using as well as the method they use to measure it.  Densely packed flour will quickly turn this into a cake.  Also, the better the cocoa powder (not hot chocolate mix!) the better these are.  Invest in your stomach and spoil your taste buds with some quality dutch cocoa and you will never go back to another recipe or store bought mix again.

LOVED this recipe!  Easy, quick and delicious!  The perfect texture..not too cakey and very moist.  I changed the flour amount to 1 cup as per the suggestion of other reviewers.  I will DEFINITELY be making these brownies again and again.  Thanks!

Very,very good brownie with a cake like texture. I used 1 1/2 cups Splenda Baking Sweetner instead of sugar and 1 cup Egg Beaters instead of Eggs. Also used whole Pecans for the nuts.

While I appreciate the simplicity of this recipe, the taste leaves something to be desired. The consistency is really cake-y as well. I added chocolate chips, but they all fell down to the bottom, thankfully they didn't burn, since I had to increase the cooking time. This is my first attempt at making brownies from scratch, and as of right now, boxed brownies mixes are winning. I may fiddle around with a few other recipes, but I doubt I'll return to this one. My brother and I had a good time making them though, thanks.

Amazing recipe.  I'll NEVER by a box mix again.  I reduced the amount of flour to 1 c., as suggested.  I also add a handful of chocolate chips to the batter before pouring it in the pan.  Yum!  I also mix all the dry stuff first (rather than in the order directed) then add the wet stuff.  Mix with a whisk and toss it in the oven.  These are the best brownies EVER!

This is a great brownie recipie.  We love making these instead of using a box mix.  As already stated by others, reduce the flour to 1 cup to have a better texture.

These were really delicious.  Of course, I didn't follow the recipe exactly...I was out of some of the ingredients.  I only had a half cup of butter so I used shortening for the other half.  I had self rising flour so I left out the salt and baking powder.  Oh, and I only used a cup of flour as other reviewers suggested.  I was worried, but I needed a chocolate fix.  But they turned out great.  They didn't look too great-a little crispy on the outside, but moist and chocolatey on the inside.  I guess I really just created my own recipe-good start though.

These were pretty good! Next time I will add some more cocoa or some semi sweet chips to help it taste a little more chocolatey. I used the amount of flour is asked for, but I added a chocolate pudding cup and I think that made them moist. I also added 1 tbsp of instant coffee... so yummy! :)

Made these with 1 cup flour, 1-1/2 cups sugar and just over 1/2 cup coconut oil as I had no butter/marg/applesauce... cooked for 25 min in 9x13 pan. They are very good.

WOW, I never made brownies from scratch before.  These are GREAT I will never use a box again.  I cut the flour to a little over one cup about 1 1/8 and used 3/4 cup of cocoa. I put a butter cream icing on them. I did not use any nuts because I did not have any on hand. They are sooo easy to  make I will be making them again.

These actually taste like real brownies!  I made butter cream frosting mixed with 2oz. of grated, melted, unsweetened chocolate, 1 c. mini marshmallows melted, and mini chocolate chips. It was so good! I also made them in a 9x9 pan, for we had few people. Excellent!!

Yummy.  Added only 3 eggs, 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce and cut down the flour to 1 cup for less cakey like brownie.  Also used brown sugar instead of white.

I've had better, but this is really good. i have experimented with this recipe lots of times and it turns out perfect every time. I would use 2 tsp. of vanilla extract though. It gives it more of a kick.

If you want quick and easy brownies try these little goodies.

This extremely rich. I used the full amount of butter, but only 1 cup of flour. Next time I'll use 1/2 cup of butter because it made it almost sickening with the amount of butter that was in it. They are definitely the way a brownie should be, but very very rich. Don't need icing at all with this recipe. Very chocolaty..very moist...and very rich!

this was an awsome recipe to make in a short amount of time. i didnt foolow the exact recipe. instead of 1 1/2 cups of flour, i put 1. and instead of leaving it in the oven for 20 minutes, i left it in for 40. it took me about an hour to make it. nice and easy. i reduced the amount of flour, because it looked and tasted better that way. try it and trust me. you wont regret it.

These brownies had a nice texture, but even though I halved the flour, they were not as chocolatey as I had expected, and a bit too sweet.  A cup of mini chocolate chips would improve the result, I believe.

These brownies are delicious. I also dropped the flour to 1 cup. One reviewer was right when she said stainless steel pans burn. I used a glass dish the first time and they turned out just fine. This time I had to turn the oven downt to 250 after the first five minutes because I could smell them cooking too fast. Turn oven to 300 if using a stainless steel pan. Delicious!

I've made homemade brownies a few times before but they always had that "I'm-new- to- baking" taste. (and they were always too cake like.) This recipe rivals the best box mix. I cut back the flour to 1 cup as suggested by other reviewers and they were D- licious!

I added chocolate chips, walnuts and decreased the flour to 1 cup. Used half white sugar, half brown sugar. These were super yummy; kinda in between cake/chewey brownies. I like that they call for cocoa instead of melted chocolate- less mess. Great base recipe- the possibilities are endless!!!

I loved these brownies, they went rather quickly and I was quite surprised! I added less flour, mini chocolate chips, and some carmel bits. They were so yummy!

This recipe was very good.  I too reduced the flour to 1 c. and it worked well.  I also spread caramel ice cream topping on top before I baked it.  Yum!

These brownies are delicious!  I too followed readers' suggestions and cut down the flour for a chewy texture.  And I added about a handful of chocolate chips because I had them on hand.  Absolutely delish!  I'll definitely make these again!

I used 1/2 c. applesauce in place of half the butter. I also took the advice of others and only used 1 c. of flour. My husband couldn't believe they were low fat! Wonderful consistency. Great taste! A+!

This was really a 4.5 for me. Not a 5 because I made 3 changes. I used 1 cup of flour and 3 eggs to acheive super chewy style and I used a heaping 1/2 cup cocoa powder. I also dusted them with powdered sugar. I am eating a warm and gooey one right now! YUMMY!

Delicious! Only 4 stars because I took the opinion of the reviewers and put only 1 cup of flower. They had the perfect texture and taste! I added a few white chocolate chips on top on a whim. Yum!

I made these today. I started making them and after I had already mixed some of the ingredients I realized I did not have any Vanilla Extract!  I used Butter and Nut instead and they are wonderful!! Thanks for sharing the recipe, everyone in my family loves them.

The most tasteless brownies I have ever made. It got such good reviews, I wonder what I did wrong? I have a great brownie recipe I've made for years but wanted to try one using cocoa- this is not it. I used less flour like others recommended but there was no flavor at all.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I was looking for one that used cocoa powder. They looked good but tasted too floury and I followed the recipe to a T. I will keep searching for a cocoa brownie recipe.

These brownies weren't awful, but they weren't great either. I didn't find them to be too cakey, but that may have been because I didn't cook them long enough. The taste was weird because it wasn't chocolatey. I will not use this recipe again.

These are very very good! My two boys and husband had their eyes rolling in the back of their head with every bite. They do taste better the day after. But if you are looking for something quick, these are great.

I think this brownie recipe turned out excellent! I made a batch, brought it in to work the next day, and it was a big hit! Like some other previous reviewers, I only added a cup of flour. I baked them in an 9x13 pan but was a little worried when they started to rise and almost overflow. They turned out OK in the end though. I added an extra 10 minutes to the time... still a little gooey... but that's how I like them! When I took them out of the oven they ended up falling. I don't know if that was what was supposed to happen, but the end result was to my liking! A gooey... but not too gooey chewy and moist brownie!

OH MY GOSH!  These are wonderful!  I have been trying different recipes for a couple of years and this is the best.  I changed it a little-3 eggs, 1.25 cups of flour and 1/2 cup of choco chips.  It is fudgy and not cakey at all when made this way.  Wonderful.

Delicious!!  I halved the recipe and baked in a 9x9 pan.  Took the recommendation of others and used a little less flour (just under 3/4 cup for half recipe).  Baked for exactly 20 minutes.  No more boxed mixes for me- this is just as easy and much tastier!

Doubled the recipe, reducing the amount of flour as recommended, and baked in a sheet cake pan. It's overflowing and taking much longer to bake. It tastes great, though.

Great Brownies! The only difference I made was the cocoa, I went a little heavier with 3/4 cup. Mine were done in 20 minutes.

Very good! I did not have butter or shortening so used olive oil. Somebody found out and warned me the brownies would be gross. They were amazing despite a slight veggie aftertaste! It is very hard to ruin a good recipe. I think the olive oil cut the sugar a bit which I would think is a good thing considering there is more sugar than flour. I will most certainly keep this in mind for the next time I must make brownies!

WOW! These turned out so yummy. I realized after getting started I only had 1 cup of white sugar, so I added 1 cup of brown sugar. Used only 1 cup of flour, as others had recommended. Only had one stick of butter, so I added a 1/2 cup of veg. oil. Also omitted nuts-added mini chocolate chips and toffee bits instead. Used a 9 x 13 pan, sprayed with Baker's Joy;cooked for 35 minutes. PERFECTION! These were by far the best brownies I have ever made.

Maybe I'm wierd but I think boxed brownie mix is the best... this is the closest I've come to that taste in a home made brownie.  I didn't have cocoa powder so I used chocolate squares instead and it turned out fine!

I prefer a chewier brownie so I reduced the flour like most suggested. Unfortunately, I was not impressed by these brownies. They were not very chocolatey (I added the last square of Bakers chocolate that I had along with the cocoa just because) and they were too cake like for me. I also found that they were a bit salty for me as well. The batter was a beautiful mousse-like cream and the texture of the brownie, when finished, was nice although the edges puffed up more than in the center. If I make these again I think I'd add chocolate chips and maybe try less egg (?).

Two thirds of the pan is gone and I've had FOUR (!!!!).  They are really good with peanut butter on them when they're hot.  I used margarine instead of butter and I think I'd reduce the flour to one cup next time to make them fudgier, I have given them four ONLY because they are a bit 'cakier' than a brownie, but REALLY GOOD.

This is so easy!  I cut flour to 1 cup and added chocolate chips to make it even more chocolatey!

Just as described, this recipe is super fast and easy. Hubby told me not to buy box brownies anymore - he prefers this one!

Really good. This is a perfect recipe for someone who likes chocolate but doesn't want the richness that usually comes in a brownie. I thought they were a little cake like (not too much though) and needed a little more cocoa powder (I personally like the richness). 
I would definately make again. 
Thanks!

I have been craving chocolate like a mad woman.  I was so glad to come across this recipe where it called for cocoa powder and not bar chocolate.

This was quick and easy.  I baked in a 9x9" pan for 30 minutes, and I think it could have been left in for another 5 or so minutes... but not much longer than that.

I also omitted walnuts, we're nutty people, but don't like nuts in our food... 

My 3 year old loved these, and now won't stop nagging me for more.  I'm sure my fiance will be 'mad' at me for baking treats.  mad because he'll want to eat them all in one sitting :)

I made these for my husband, 14 year old and her boyfriend and they loved them.

I made them exactly as the recipe called for using my Kitchen Aid mixer, except I omitted the nuts abd at the end I melted 3 tablespoons of deulce de leche (used President's Choice brand) for 3 seconds in the microwave.  I made a grid with lines of the melted caramel across the top of the mix (poured into the pan) and then swirled them around with a knife. 

I greased the pan well with Crisco and then baked them for 30 minutes and they came out perfectly. 20 minutes is not long enough.  

The brownies came out beautifully moist and soft - the caramel I used worked really well. They're quite light, like a cake almost and aren't as rich, chewy or chocolatey as a store-bough brownie.  They are really nice, however, and I will make them again.

This is the second time I've made these brownies and they are a huge hit.  I happen to like cake-like brownies, so I basically leave the recipe alone in that regard.  Since some people don't like (or can't have) nuts, I have taken the suggestion of other reviewers and added chocolate chips instead.  Decadant!!  Honestly the best brownies I've ever had.

These are awesome.  I made them the recipe way and they were awesome.  I didn't have any butter tonight and I made them with 3/4 c of oil and 1./4 cup of applesauce.  THey turned out really good and moist.  I did slightly miss the butter flavor of the original recipe, next time I am going to try 1.2 c butter and then the other 1/2 cup as oil or applesauce or a mixture of the two.

I would definitely make these again! I ate three in the past 45 minutes! Very yummy indeed and so easy! I didn't have two sticks of butter so i used 1/2 cup butter (one stick) and a half cup of vegetable oil and i don't think it made any difference. I also used chocolate chips instead of walnuts but I think it could definitely use the nuts, i have to add them next time.

I loved this recipe!!!!  It was so easy.  I did as others and used only 1 cup of flour, because I love them gooey and not cakey.  I also only used 3 eggs.  Hubby and kids loved them.  Thanks a bunch!!!

These brownies are wonderful and SOOO quick and simple to make! I love that you can mix all the ingredients in a large saucepan, rather than using mulitiple bowls. It certainly makes clean up time a lot quicker and easier!
I don't like my brownies too cakey, so I only added 1 cup of flour and added 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips to replace the nuts (as we were going to a nut-free event), baked for exactly 30 minutes and they turned out beautifully! 
These brownies would be wonderful as a dessert, warm with icecream!!! Yum!

I needed an easy brownie recipe to fill in for a layered brownie recipe that called for a box mix. This was almost as easy.  I usually prefer chewy fudgy brownies, but these held up well under the topping of chocolate chips, marshmallows and graham cracker crumbs. Wouldn't bake them alone unless I altered the recipe to make them more fudgy, but love how easy they were in a pinch!

This is a great recipe, and you can tell from the batter... sweet and chocolaty with a hint of vanilla. It's a wonder I managed to bake any of it, since I was licking the spoon so much.

I prefer my brownies thick and chewy, so I altered it to 3 eggs and 1 1/4c flour, then baked in an 8x8 pan. It takes about 40 minutes to bake but is worth every tantalizing second. I have been bombarded with requests for the recipe.

Thanks for sharing!

These are awesome.  I was multi-tasking while stirring this recipe up and put one teaspoon of soda instead of 1/2 tsp of powder. So I added 1 tsp of powder and they turned out light and fluffy and thick like cake. YUMMY!

The brownies were excellent!  I followed other reviews and used 1 1/2 C sugar, 3 eggs, and 1 C flour.  I used the full 30 minutes for baking and I also added 1/2 C chocolate chips, then sprinkled toffee bits on top before baking.  Thanks for the recipe!

loved these, I did make some changes if you want fudgy brownies only use 1 cup flour and 3 eggs.  I crushed up candy bars (smickers on one side and twix on the other) and sprinkled on top before baking.  Very good!  I recommend using the tin foil method in the greased pan so you can lift out the brownies for easier cutting.

Best brownies I've made hands down.  And just as easy as a box mix with 10X better results.  I reduced flour slightly to get moister brownie (vs. cakelike) and added chocolate chips.  Next time might try adding butterscotch chips.  Getting ready to make 2x batch in a week - they go fast.

When I read "cakelike" brownies, I thought I wouldn't like them.  But, oh yes, they are so good!  They are less dense, but still rich.  I made a half recipe in a 9 X 9, used pecans instead of walnuts - and stuck some peanut butter chips and butterscotch chips in one side.  Tried some powdered frosting on some, too.  I was surprised at how moist they stayed overnight, too.  I'm made them earlier this week and I'm making another 1/2 batch again tonight.  
These take about 10 minutes to throw together - put the butter in the microwave on defrost for a couple minutes while you gather the rest of the ingredients.  I will never buy another box again - they have trans fats (partially hydrogenated oils and/or shortening) in them.  These are still fattening, but not as bad as box mixes.  
YUM!!

These are very light and fluffy.  They were good.  I did use some spenda in place of a portion of the sugar but they are good.  I think next time I will stir in some chocolate chips because I like a little more chocolate flavor.

WOW! Im not a brownie lover, but I think that is because I always used the boxed kind. This was my first attempt at making brownies from scratch, and they are delicious!! I lined a 9x13 pan with tin foil, then greased that for easy remval and cutting!! This recipe is soooo good!!

Great recipe. I'd only ever made brownies with real chocolate before so I was surprised these ones tasted so chocolatey! The only change I made was to use chopped almonds as I didn't have any walnuts. Easy to make and pretty tasty.

The brownies had a good taste and texture, there is not enough mixture however for a 9 x 13 pan, it works better with a 9 x 9.
A very easy no fail recipe.

This recipe is very good.  I use 1 1/2 cups self-rising  flour and omit the baking powder.  I also bake at 325 for about 30 to  40 minutes or until tooth pick inserted comes out clean.  This makes the brownies more chewy than cake like.

These were delicious! I too reduced the flour to 1 cup, and added 1 cup of chocolate chips like some other reviewers. They took about 40 minutes to bake. A huge plus in my book is that they don't have partially hydrogenated oils, like all the brownie mixes I looked at in the store.
Very delicious!!! Hubby couldn't stop eating them.

My husband is severely lactose intolerant and I was looking for a chocolate dessert for Christmas that he could eat too. All I needed to do was use Fleishmann's Unsalted butter instead of regular butter and voila! it was lactose-free. For the chocolate lover in the house (me), they tasted as good as ever.

Very easy recipe to follow.  I used Hershey's special dark cocoa powder.  I sifted both the cocoa and all purpose flour; made a very, very smooth texture when baking was done.  I replaced the nuts with 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I made these for a birthday and they were a huge hit.

These brownies were very good and SOOOOO easy. The simplicity of this recipe is what I like most about it. 

I didn't add the nuts, because the kids don't like them. And They took about 25 minutes to bake. 

I will make these again sometime soon.

Took the 1 cup flour trick, added probably 3/4 cup peanuts instead of the 1/2 walnuts, and these were very good. Perfect cakey/chewy combination. NOT cake and NOT fudge. They were quite similar to those two-bite things groceries sell but obviously much fresher and preservative-free. My new regular brownie recipe.

I love this recipe. However i altered it slighty. Instead of cocoa I used hot chocolate mix (mainly because I didn't have cocoa in my house) but also because I love the taste that the hot chocolate gives the brownies. I also left out the nuts. The hot chocolate gives it a texture similar to cake though so if you are like me and you don't like brownies with a cake-like texture, you should cut down on the amount of flour given in the recipe.

Easy to make, good taste but a little too 'cake like' for me.  I also omitted the vanilla extract, used pecans instead of walnuts since I had them onhand and dusted the tops with powdered sugar.  I would make again.

They may not be the prettiest brownies I've ever seen, but these were delicious.  Mine kind of collapsed in the oven so they looked nothing like the picture, but they came out like a wonderful combination of fudge, cake, and brownie.  Quick and easy.  I will make these again very soon.  I halved the recipe, left out the nuts, and added a few tablespoons of milk.

Not the best brownie ever....I was looking for the Hersery's one bowl brownie recipes - I've used it before with great results and thought that this one would be close but it wasn't even close. They turned out too cakey, to be fair it could be because I used extra large eggs which could be the reason but I don't think I'll be trying this one again.

Wow! This was great! I usually don't make brownies from scratch because it takes too long and I usually don't have baking chocolate on hand. I cooked the brownies for the minimum time (I like them a little gooey) and it was SO moist! Great recipe! Very easy to make.

I made these when I was having a sweet craving, but I only had 3/4c. flour. Don't trust the conversions b/c when the recipe is halved (for 10 not 20) the batter comes out too buttery (butter actually boiled out during baking) and eggy (in a firm way). And I used Stevia not sugar, though it should'nt have mattered. Overall though, the mixture smelled yummy, and after dipping the mini brownies in caramel sauce, they were decent enough to satisfy my craving.

These were fantastic!  I cut out the walnuts, but added about 1/2 cup of chopped dark chocolate (I just happened to have some on hand, and this was a good way to keep me from snacking on it) to the butter mixture after it was removed from heat. Definitely underbake these: I was at 24 minutes - they seemed raw at first, but a couple of hours later and on into the week they are perfect and moist.  There's nothing worse than an overbaked brownie!  I'll be using this recipe agan.

These were AMAZING!  I made these for a Garage sale and all but one sold!  I made a few alterations.  I took others advice and I lowered the flour to 1 cup.  I replaced the walnuts with 3/4 c. of choc. chips. I also added another 1/4 c. of choc. chips on top after I poured them into the pan.  I baked them for 30 minutes at 350

These brownies were a bit more cakey than fudgey.  It was a bit plain by itself, so I recommend adding nuts and/or chocolate chips in with the batter OR serve the brownies with whip cream, cool whip or ice cream.  All in all it was a perfectly adequate brownie recipe, especially if you don't want to go through the trouble of melting chocolate.

Living in an area with no all-night stores, I had to cope with chocolate cravings by making this and boy does it work wonderfully! I absolutely loved this!!!!
I'm going to make another batch to take to a Final Episode of Desperate Housewives party I'm going to tonight. Thanks!

My family and I loved these brownies. They did take a  bit longer to cook than the recipe said, but they were worth it. I didn't have any walnuts, but pecans worked great. To top it off I used a can of creamcheese icing...they were marvelous!

This recipe is relatively quick and somewhat easy, but I have to admit I didn't care for it. I thought the brownies were a bit dry and tasted plain.  I have another quick and easy recipe that I like better.

I made this as listed the first time.  I ended up with cake like brownies and not a chewy one.  I made only one change.  I used 2 eggs and not 4.  Everything else I made as listed.

I have made these brownies over and over again.   I have made them with regular flour as well as gluten free flour and they have turned out fantastic every time. Everyone raves about how good they are. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

These were super easy to make, I followed what most of the other reviewers said and only used 1 cup of flour.. I left out the walnuts (personal preference) I was pleasantly surprised at how good these came out!! Definitely a keeper ??

They were delicious, but mine turned out much more cake like. I was hoping for more chewy. Flavor was good though.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and I loved them!  I like a more cake-like brownie with a milder chocolate flavor and these were wonderful!  I baked them for 25 minutes in a 9x13 pan.

I made these for my husband, so this is based on his opinion. I don't eat sugar or flour. 
His opinion is...they're delicious! I may have created a monster however, since he thought boxed brownies would be better.  Not anymore. I like to make them homemade so I know what's in them vs. processed foods in a box. 
This is a keeper, and highly recommended by Ed.

These are so easy to make.  Very good results. Especially good if you need a quick dessert as you probably have all the ingrédients at home.  The only change I made was to add a cup of chopped walnuts to the batter.  My only suggestion is to watch the timer carefully so that you do not overbake them. They will become "tough"instead of chewy. They are definitely sweet enough. Don't need any frosting. I will never buy boxed brownie mix again. And, I'm not likely to buy  "bakery brownies" either.  These are delicious!!

I followed the  recipe and  ingredients. I always make a recipe 
step by step and all ingredients the first time. They were nice and sweet. Something seemed to be missing though. 
I did make a batch with gluten free flour for my daughter in-law. she loved them.
I  am giving this 4 stars for my daughter in-law.
If it is as written, I would have given it 3 stars.  I will keep looking for a brownie recipe that uses cocoa. am still looking for a brownie recipe.

Just made it and I prepared a 9X13 and thought I have  never used larger than an 8 x 8 for brownies.  Started pouring and decided I would have just crust (yum for me).  Anyway transferred it to 8 x 8 and they are great.  Did take longer to cook though.

I don't understand why people are giving this recipe a good review and then saying they modified it. The recipe as is has too much flour. Turns out cakey and kind of dry.

Made them per the recipe instructions.  They are gross!! Greasy with butter.  Not much chocolate flavor.   DEFINITELY NOT thick like pictured.  Wasted paper printing the recipe.  Do yourself a favor -- don't waste your time on these brownies!!

Really awesome recipe! I added a bit more butter and a little less flour because I like mine extra fudgy, Chuck them in the fridge for 15 minutes before eating with little bits of chocolate mixed in and they are to die for!

I've made this twice now and both times it has been very popular.  The first time I made it without nuts (tasty), the second time with nuts (tasty but I think I would do 3/4 or 1 c next time).  We like that it isn't sickeningly sweet.  Def more of a cakey consistency.  Mine baked for 25 min which was great.  Next time I think I might try increasing the cocoa powder in it.  It's a very flexible recipe - would be fun to try with chocolate chips, bits of caramel, peppermint chunks, etc.

Real easy an fast to make really good what I did is I added just a little extra cocoa powder at the end for extra cocoa flavor but it turned out excellent and I agree with all the reviews that you need to use just one cup of flour don't use 1 and 1/2 cups of flour if you use of one cup it is makes it perfect I would recommend this any time any day.

This recipe was not as described. The brownies were cake like and very dry. I think 4 eggs is too many and maybe only use 1 cup flour.

I would combine all of the wet ingredients and then dry because then it turns out a little chunky but it is good if you are in a hurry.just pretty basic brownies.

These are so simple you could make them standing on one leg.......Really, I have my leg in a cast due to surgery and made these very quickly. I went with the original recipe and they turned out great.

These were delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, I just added a few candy corns on top as it getting closer to Halloween. They turned out great! Not cakey but not too moist either. I only baked for 20 minutes. Perfect.

Love it! This recipe is easy and the cleaning up was effortless. I followed the recipe except I reduced the amount of sugar to 1.5 cups and added 2 scoops of nutella! The brownies were well received!

Amazing! this recipe is my second attempt at brownies, the first recipe was such a fail that it took me quite some time to regain confidence and try again. This recipe is quick,simple, delicious and virtually no fail. After reading reviews I tried the fudgey kind first by reducing the flour and the second time I made following original recipe, perfect both ways. I will never search for another brownie recipe again, thank you.

I substituted 1 cup of canola oil for the butter, and I did still use 1 1/2 cups of flower and baked for 27 min. They did not come out super cakey, they were more fudgey which we like. Instead of nuts on top, I put coconut flakes. Overall they are pretty good brownies, the only thing I would prefer if they were more dark chocolatey. They are pretty light brown in color and not a huge bold chocolate flavor.

Except for adding a little more cocoa to the batter, I made this exactly to recipe.  It turned out more like a nice flavored cake-like brownie.  Next time I will take another reviewers advice and reduce the eggs for a more moist brownie.  Loved the easiness of the recipe...and....tasted good!

Made this with organic whole wheat pastry flour. Cut the sugar in half and added about a half a cup of honey.  I add almonds or Chia seeds. 
It’s awesome with either.

I did what others said and used 1 cup flour. It turned out ok, would be better with chocolate chips added to it. Not as cakey as I was expecting. I’ll probably make it again. Over all it did taste  pretty good.

Everyone loved these brownies. Had to make another batch the next day.  I did add 1 egg and changed the flour to 2/3 cup instead of 1/2 (this was accidental but very well received).

I was hoping this would be a  cakey brownie recipe.  When read the reviews where people said they cut back on the flour so it WOULDN'T be cakey, I decided to stick to the original recipe, except for adding another 1/4 cup of walnuts, since I like a nuttier brownie.  I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan for 20 minutes at first, but it needed a total of 30 minutes for the knife to come out clean.  That's pretty quick as far as I'm concerned.   

I did mix the ingredients a little differently than shown in the video.  I combined the sugar and cocoa powder, then added the melted butter, then the vanilla and eggs.  I combined the flour, salt and baking powder in a smaller bowl like most recipes recommend before adding it to the wet ingredients.  I added the walnuts after the flour mixture was combined with the wet ingredients.  I wanted to prevent any dry flour from sticking to the walnuts.  I was happy with the results and would make it again!

I made them and I’m very satisfied with them.  Actually I’d like a stronger flavor but I had all ingredients in house do I made them.  I’d make them again maybe add more cocoa to them next time.

They were super easy and pretty good. Not the best brownies I've ever had but far from the worst. I didn't have butter so I used vegetable oil instead. I also cut the flour down to one cup and raised the cocoa powder to 2/3 cup. Next time I will sprinkle chocolate chips on top before I bake it.

Wonderful base recipe! For those looking for cake-y yet still chewy brownies this is what i did. Used all the flour it calls for. Reduces sugar to 1.5 C. Added 1/4 C extra cocoa. Used 1/2 C butter and 1/4 C oil (just short on butter in my house). Added 1/4 tsp extra baking powder. I cooked at 300 as some said to and had to cook it for 45 min. So perhaps 325 is a better temp? It did turn out GREAT though!!

I cut the recipe in half and added 2 tablespoons more flour. I like a more cake-like brownie and I succeeded. Excellent flavor! I don’t know why anybody makes brownies from a box! It’s so easy to make them with Cocoa!

Most brownies are easy to make but this one is slightly quicker.
I followed one reviewer's advice and upped the cocoa powder and reduced by the same amount the flour. The brownies came out dense and chewy. just the way I like them..

This is my new favorite from scratch brownie recipe. I substituted half a cup of oil for half a cup of the butter because that's what I had, and followed others' advice and added 1/4 cup more cocoa powder. I like my brownies a little cakey, and the texture on these was perfect. And it was sooo easy.

I have no idea what happened here but I legit ended up with a cake. I cut the flour to 1 cup as suggested. I Know I only did 1/2 tsp of baking powder. Perhaps it was my choice to use the electric mixer?

I added in chocolate chips instead of nuts as they needed to be nut free for a function. They were a hit!

Good chocolate flavor but it was very dry, to the point where I need a drink of something with each bite.  I cut the sugar to 1 cup instead of two because we prefer not so sweet desserts.  Strange I know.  Will not make this again.  However, it was easy to make.

Delicious! Thank you for sharing your recipe and thank you for all the reviews. Like many otgers, I modified the recipe to our liking. 4 star because of modifications but to be fair I never did try the original recipe. 

My modifications: Used a half cup of butter and a half cup of pureed avocado instead of the full cup of butter, reduced flour to 1 cup, used 2 instead of 4 eggs, reduced sugar to 3/4 cup white and 1/2 cup brown instead of 2 cup of white, 2/3 cups cocoa powder instead of 1/2 cup, and I added chocolate chips. Baked for 25 minutes. I was afraid it was going to be too thin therefore be too dry but it was so chocolatey and moist.  Because of the chocolate chips, I will reduce the sugar even more next time.

I live in Peru. The white sugar here is not so refined as in the US. I used azucar rubia and reduced the amount to 1 & 3/4 cup as well as diminishing the flour to 1 &1/4 cup and used only 2 eggs. Additionally, I used 1/2 cup margarine and 1/2 cup vegetable oil. The brownies are excellent. I sell them in the street.

Used this recipe earlier today. As per some suggestions used just one cup of flour and added 1/2 cup of shelled hemp seeds. They tasted fantastic. My husband said the brownies “tasted like hope.” I don’t know what that means. But, they were delicious. Definitely my new go to brownie recipe.

If I wanted to make a cake I could’ve searched up cake instead of brownies. Once I had already made the “brownies” I saw the reviews and how everyone changed the recipe. Why put up a recipe that says it’s one this but is another? 100% disappointed. Especially since I don’t like cake. I don’t know anything about baking so this is honestly such a disappointment to the point where I cried. Call me sensitive but this needs to be edited. If I wanted a cake I would’ve put in the recipe asking for a cake. Fake snakes everywhere.

I was looking for an easy and simple recipe to make brownies. This recipe was great. I didn't bake it in the recommended pan, instead I used a mini muffin pan for bite size pieces. The brownies didn't look exactly like the picture shown, but that's okay because the brownies were still a hit with my coworkers. I'll try this recipe again later on with the actual size pan it requests and will determine if I can yield the same results as it the picture here in the recipe. I will keep you folks posted. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

It’s awesome! I used 1c of flour as suggested and added a handful chocolate chips. I needed a quick recipe for a school party that my son told me about last minute. These are super easy and quick. My daughter got 2 brownies that were extras and is begging for me to make her an entire pan now.

I have always failed at baking, so imagine my excitement when I made these delicious brownies with such ease!! I only used 1 cup of flour as others had suggested. I made a small batch my first time. Between the 4 of us, they were gone in a matter of minutes.

Followed the recipe exactly, brownies had a nice soft texture but were not nearly sweet enough.Would recommend adding another half cup or maybe even full cup of sugar.

I sprinkled powdered sugar and pecan pieces (I didn't have walnuts so I used pecans) on top for a decoration. Pecans were a good substitute for walnuts. It was a really easy recipe to follow and I will probably use it again. Five stars from me!

I have a diabetic celiac at home and this recipe was one of the most easily adaptable I found. I removed the walnuts because I didn't have any handy. It turned out pretty well. I used a mix of three different gluten free flour: potato, cassava thick grain and rice. Next time I think I'll substitute out the cassava thick grain for cornflour to make it smoother. Also, I think I'll reduce the amount of flour by a fifth. It became quite thick, but the flavor is really good and it is a much better alternative than buying preprocessed every time.

I used 1 cup of flower as others posted, I may try only 3 eggs next time. They were more cakey than fudgey, but still delicious. I added a little bit of peanut butter on top as well.

The only thing you have to do is add milk because even though it doesn't say to if you don't it turns out like dough in stead of batter.

I made these brownies and they turned out yummy. But I left out the walnuts and added caramel chips. Otherwise I made them exactly how the recipe read. The batter was very thin and I was concerned. I had to bake them for 40 minutes at 350°. I Dont know why it had to take almost twice the time.

I added chocolate chips and grated cooking chocolate into the batter. I think should add it to the pan later to prevent it sinking to the bottom.

Super easy and delicious. As other reviewers suggested, I reduced the amount of flour to 1 cup. I also added 1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips and reduced the walnuts to about 1/3 cup. Great recipe for when you don't want to run to the store for brownie mix!

Good in a fix. I ended up having to use some hot chocolate mix with the cocoa powder because I didn't have enough. Turned out good.

Made these for dinner guests. I cut the sugar to 1.5cups.... was still super sweet... but good. May try cutting down a bit more next time when its just for our family. Great taste and a quick recipe though!

I followed this recipe exactly except I used 1 cup of oil instead of butter (as I didn't have any) my 5 year old did all the mixing and they turned out great, lovely and chewy inside. My husband loved them. Next time I will be making it with butter and I am sure they will be even more delicious. Thank you for this quick, easy and yummy recipe.

I made these with only 1 cup of flour as others recommended and I thought they were only okay (but my family liked them).  I felt like it was too cakey to be called a brownie.  I would also reduce the vanilla as I felt the flavour too overpowering.  Definitely quick and easy though.

This is my go to brownie recipe.  Takes longer to bake than stated in my oven.  I add extra nuts because I love them. Leave  extra time to bake if needed.  When baked  I sprinkle with powdered sugar.  They are well loved and remembered.

I followed the recipe exactly. I agree with others about wanting the brownies to be more chocolate-y, but I was okay with the amount of flour in them. These are certainly quick and easy since they use pantry staples. Not the best brownie, but they certainly are good.

Quick and Easy is the  right name for these brownies.  The kids loved them (I did too).  On the sweet side though so you may want to cut back on the sugar slightly.

They were ok, but were kind of dry in the middle of 1 bar.

I have played with and made so many brownie recipes through the years.  They were all OK.  My search is now over.  These are fantastic and so easy.  I love they only take cocoa, since it is a staple in my cupboard.  I did put 1 tsp. of almond extract in, because I love the flavor.  Thank you, thank you.  I'm making a batch today for my cookie tray.

I have made these brownies to many times to count. They are always a hit and everyone asks me for the recipe. I have added chocolate chips instead of nuts and they always come out great. The only I changed was the time. No matter what stove I use, or pan it always seems to take 45 minutes instead of 20 to 30.  I am baking some right now...so good. Thank you for sharing.

Brought this at a holiday party where several people also brought brownies and I am the only one that went home with an empty pan! Followed suggestions to reduce to 2 eggs, 1 cup flour, and add chocolate chips (semi sweet). Only placed 1 3/4 cup white sugar because that’s all I had. Cooked a bit longer, about 35 mins on a rectangular pan. They were fudgy and chewy in the middle.

This is my go to dessert whenever I need something quick and yummy. I always have the ingredients on hand. I frequently double it and make one pan with walnuts and one without (although I prefer the nuts, not everyone does) Sometimes I throw in a handful of mini chocolate chips. People always love these brownies and say how much better they are than boxed mixes.

I followed the recipe as written. The texture of the batter is like frosting.  I really thought I'd done something wrong, but I really wanted brownies and didn't want to start over so I put it in the oven anyway.  So glad I did! They have a great texture somewhere between fudgy and cakey.  One star off though because they lack in chocolate flavor.  Will have to tweak that.  
Thanks!

I'm giving four stars because I did as others suggested with halving the butter and adding the ingredients with a mixer but the 9x13 pan was too big for the batch I made. Next time, I will use my 8x8 pan for thicker and bigger brownies than thin ones.

I made these brownies this past weekend and they were wonderful. I love that this recipe has all of the ingredients in one bowl. The only thing I changed in this recipe, is that I added a little bit more cocoa then what the recipe called for, but that was it. These brownies were easy to make and delicious.

Too sweet for my taste. Took longer to cook in my oven, and it came out a bit too fudgy for me. It tasted okay, but I will reduce the amount of sugar next time and maybe increase the temperature. Not great but not terrible either.

I have made these several times. They are half cake, half fudgey. Hard to explain. Best brownies I've ever made and I'm 61 years old and have been cooking brownies for maybe 45 years! I use dark chocolate cocoa (personal preference)and toast the nuts before putting them in the batter.  Thanks for this excellent recipe!!

So easy to make.  First time making brownies from scratch.  I followed recipe with making some minor adjustments. Used 1 and half cups of sugar. It was fine for me but  hubby prefers a little more sweet. Next time will use 1 and 3/4 cups of sugar. Used 1 1/2 tsp vanilla and a tad over 1/2  cup of unsweetened cacao powder.  I also added half cup of walnuts.   Baked in a 9x9.5 pan for 30 minutes.   Lined pan with greased parchment paper. Came out of pan and off paper, easy peasy.  We like cake style brownies.  We enjoyed taste and texture and will use this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing.

Been trying to find that perfect brownie recipe that the whole family likes. This is it. Good fresh out the oven, or cooled. Not too sweet and even the ones that don't like nuts in brownies like the nuts in this recipe. I think we found our go to brownie recipe.

Yum, did add extra cocoa powder and chocolate chips with a bit less flour as per other reviews and had to bake twice as long (smaller pan = thicker brownies = longer bake time) but were absolutely the best  brownies I have ever had!!!

It was so good!! I used 1 cup of flour instead of 1 1/2 cups. I also added some water to the mixture, as it was very dry and wasn't mixing too well. It took an hour for them to bake. But overall these brownies are heaven! And I'm going to start making these instead of the pre-made mixes.

Love this recipe!! It's so fast and delicious! And all the ingredients I always have on hand. I did only use two eggs and added a little bit if water as I like my brownies more fudgy. We will make these a lot more!

Liked very much.  Didn't taste too sweet or too rich which I appreciated.

Really good. I followed other reviewers advice by reducing the flour to 1 cup AND reduced eggs to two, since I like denser, less cake-like brownies.   Next time, I think I will reduce the butter as well because I thought they came out a little too oily.  My son couldn't wait, so we let these cool for a bit and ate the first ones while still warm.   You need to let these cool completely before eating, otherwise they taste very buttery.  They are perfect when cool.

I'm a fairly inexperienced baker and this was my first time making brownies from scratch. It was an easy recipe to follow, though I did make some of the changes based on the reviews. I used 1 cup of flour, only three eggs instead of four, and reduced the butter by about a quarter. They turned out really amazing and fudgy. I also added some chocolate chips and eliminated the walnuts. Will definitely be making them again.

I added a touch (1/4 tsp) more vanilla, used semi sweet chocolate chips instead of nuts,  and I sprinkled chocolate chips on top.

These are great! I took the advice of several other reviewers and used only one cup of flour. I think next time I will cut the sugar a little, too. They are almost overwhelmingly sweet (and I have a sweet tooth)... but delicious!

I loved them! I made the recipes exactly like they said and it was more cake-like, but I like it that way. It was really nice and chewy, too. I sprinkled Reeses chips on the top when I baked them. Delightful. My first time for brownies from "scratch."

I followed the recipe exactly. I liked that they were cake-like, that's what I prefer. I prefer my brownies to be more chocolatey than how these came out, but I will just up the cocoa amount like another reviewer suggested :) they were super easy to make! No more store bought brownies for me :)

This recipe was absolutely fabulous. Very fast, very easy, and tons of fun! I brought some to my friends and they mostly gave 10/10 (one said she didn't like the nuts, but you can't please everyone) family was still looking for it in the fridge after they disappeared. Would make again!

OMG, The best Brownie I have found so far. Made them per recipe but deleted the salt due to using salted butter. Wife and I ate half the pan before they were cool enough to take out and put in cookie box. This recipe just became my goto...

As suggested, I reduced the flour to 1 cup and I also used 3 eggs instead of 4.  I made no other changes. I loved the results and will continue to use this easy recipe. These are the best-tasting brownies yet!

I also cut the flour amount down to just 1 Cup. Everything else I did follow AND added a handful of chocolate chips.  This was super super easy to put together, the hardest part was waiting for them to cool! I will make this again with my 7 year old granddaughter!  No frosting is needed either!!

I made the brownie recipe for my family and they just loved them.  I used less flour as suggested and they were just perfect. I did not add the nuts because my 2 grandsons have this thing about nuts in anything.  The brownies were chewy moist and very chocolaty. I will definitely make them again.

I chose this recipe because my young daughter wanted to bake brownies and I thought it would make for a good beginner recipe.  She stuck to the recipe and was able to make them perfectly, with ease.  I love that these ingredients are always in my pantry/fridge.  My brownie recipe calls for two kinds of melted chocolate, a double boiler and carefully combining melted chocolate with eggs without scrambling them, she didn't need to deal with all of that. I must admit that mine tastes a bit better, which is why I gave this recipe 4 stars.  I'm an experienced baker and cook with many years under my belt and have learned to really taste food.  My husband, daughter and a few other friends absolutely loved and devoured these brownies which is also why I gave it 4 stars.  If you're looking for homemade brownies that are delicious, quick and easy this is a great recipe!

Dude, these were THE bomb.com. I only used 1 cup of flour, as some of the other reviewers suggested. The texture was amazingly perfect - moist and rich. It was not cake-like, since I reduced the flour, but hey, if ya like cake brownies, use the full amount of flour ;) I did everything as suggested, except I substituted chocolate chips for the nuts, and only needed to cook it for 25 minutes. Definitely a recipe I will be bookmarking!

This was an easy and delicious recipe!  I took them to a New Year's Eve party and everyone raved about them.  I did decrease the flour to 1 cup as others had advised.  I will cook these many more times!

I loved these!  But, didn't get any comments from family or work on them.  Probably not chocolately enough for others, but perfect for me.

Just finished making these. I made them exactly as directed minus the nuts and they came out awesome! Like the perfect brownie! This is definitely a wonderful easy recipe.  Baked for 25 min in a 9x13 glass dish. Very chocolatey, soft yet chewy and kid approved too!

Really good!  I followed the 1 cup (only) of flour, 9 x 9 pan advice and added 1/2 cup of dried cherries.  Outstanding.

I had every ingredient for this recipe on hand, very practical. I baked it for just over 20 minutes so it would still be on the gooey side. It worked, people were too impatient to wait for them to cool. I tried them fresh out of the oven as well as the next morning and they were good. Would make again.

Not chocolatey or fudgy enough for us. Rather tasteless, and way too cakey for my liking. I would rather buy the $0.99 generic mix at the grocery store.  So much for my midnight sweet-tooth snack. :-(

Followed the recipe as listed, excluding the salt. I don't like adding salt to anything.  Turned out great!! Will for sure write this one out and use it again and again. Was quick to throw it all together as well, made for the perfect quick baking night.

This is closest to boxed brownies that I've ever made--after decades, the search is finally over! I love that it only requires cocoa instead of chocolate pieces. It's a relatively flexible recipe, allowing me to use 1/2 applesauce/butter and a mix of white and whole wheat flour (I use roughly a 70/30 ratio).

I also decrease the sugar on nearly all the sweets that I bake. Make without any substitutions first...If you need to have that harder (sugar crusted)top, keep the sugar amount as is.

I halved the flour and subbed oil for butter, but this thing was still super cake-y. I usually love Allrecipes recipes but this one was a don't-repeat for me. :/

I put my own spin on this recipe after making it the first time as directed..  Always good to use a base and tweak it to make your own and share.   I used 1/2 c butter and added some coconut oil, instead of cocoa powder, I used Cacao powder and some peanut butter powder, then added some cacao nibs , a dash of chocolate habanero powder. I reduced the flour to 1c. and used 2  eggs...  Another spin is to add espresso coffee, chambord and hint of cinnamon...  or you can try a hint of espresso vodka...

I love this recipe because it is insanely easy and they are delicious. A touch crispy on the top and edges but chewy on the inside. Sometimes I will mix in angel flake sweetened coconut to the mix and then sprinkle some on the top before I bake them. Everyone who eats these brownies always loves them and wants the recipe!  Well done !!

Great, simple recipe! I kept the flour at 1 1/2 cups but reduced eggs to 3. I also added 2 T of dark chocolate powder and 1/4 cup of  chocolate chips.    I had to cook for 45 min at 350.  Delish!

I made it exactly as written, mixed by hand instead of a mixer, and baked in a 9x13 pan for 23 minutes. They turned out  extremely moist. These pair well with a tall glass of milk. ?

Used 1 1/4 cup of flour
Used 4 large blocks of bakers chocolate
Crispy edges and gooey center ( my son's favorite)
Better than boxed brownie  mix.

Fantastic! Reduced flour, as suggested, and these were the perfect brownie. Perfect light top bite, chewy and fudgey in the middle but but not too gooey or undercooked. Beyond easy to prepare. My husband said it was the best brownie he ever tasted. Love it!

I used half a cup of flour, as recommended by most reviewers but also switched the plain flour for coconut flour. Also used coconut sugar instead of white sugar and these brownies turned out great. Will definitely make again- very simple and easy. Also works well when poured into muffin cases before baking. Brownies had a nice crispy top and gooey middles.

Made a few changes, for lack of ingredients, so it maybe have been a five.  Cut back on oil and used applesauce and added coffee for a nice twist.

They were sooo good. I added dark chocolate chips made by Ghirardelli. My mom is a health nut so instead of using white sugar I used organic coconut sugar. My little brother is 10 and he said that they were the best brownies he has ever tasted in his entire life!

Needed to make bars for a morning event and it was about 11pm.  Found this easy recipe and I had all the ingredients on hand.  As advertised, they are very fast and very easy.  Best part is that they are also very good.  Made exactly as the recipe called for with a dusting of  powdered sugar. They were a big hit the next morning.  A winner!

I followed this recipe and only used 1 cup of flour at the suggestion of other users, though I don't think that had anything to do with the reason I didn't enjoy these brownies.They turned out like chocolate sheet cake.

Very good brownie and with a few simple changes, can be a five star.
1)  NEEDS MORE CHOCOLATE! I could barely taste the chocolate in these.
2)  It was still wobbling at 30 minutes.  Needs 35-40 minutes.

Change those two things and you have in my opinion a perfect brownie.  I loved the consistency and the taste other than the lack of chocolate.  Easy to make as well.  Thanks for the recipe.  I will make it again with the above changes.

It was a yummy recipe, but it came out  pretty runny in the middle . I only had about 1/2 cup of flour on hand, that could have been it. We cooked it for 25-30 more minutes, and eventually just sprinkled the bottom with powdered sugar. I really liked it though! I think I'll make this again.

My daughter loved the "cake". She is 2 1/2 and doesn't know better. This recipe asked for too many eggs in my opinion. The result was a cake like brownie that nobody wanted to eat (except my daughter)..

I've made this recipe a half dozen times or so now and have discovered some things that helped me.  First, I didn't change the recipe at all, other than leaving out the walnuts.  When I made the batter, I made it one ingredient at a time -- added butter to sugar, mixed well, added next ingredient, mixed well, and so on.  This totally changed the taste of the finished brownies -- SO MUCH better tasting!

There are definitely a cake-like brownie, not a fudgy brownie.  But, that's what I was looking for and what we like the most.

Great recipe!

My family LOVES this dish! It is quick and easy to make, especially on short notice! My brother, however, is allergic to walnuts, so the very first time that I made it I did not add the nuts. I haven't made it with them since! They are perfectly fine without the chopped walnuts. These brownies go great with cold ice cream and fudge! *Sidenote : The batter doesn't taste good, so it's great to break that nasty habit! :)

Easy peasy lemon squeezey!  I only used 1 cup of flour and instead of walnuts, I used pecans.  I sprinkled them with powdered sugar  as soon as I took them out of the oven.  I used 2 glass 9X9 pans so it took the entire 30 minutes.  This will be my "go to" brownie recipe from now on.

These were definitely fast and super easy! I had everything needed on hand, I was thrilled to have brownies once again! I took another's suggestion and reduced the cup of flour from 1½ to 1C. It turned out perfectly I'm glad I took their suggestion!   I cooked mine in an electric oven for 30 mins and they were super moist! Give it a try!

With 1 cup flour, 3 eggs and 1/4 tsp of baking powder these were perfect. Just the consistency I like for brownies. They are like store bought but so much better and fast to make. I didn't even need to use the mixer! I will be making these again.

I used a little less sugar, one bar of Ghirardelli semi sweet chocolate(in addition to the cocoa) melted with the butter, and about 1/4 tsp.cinnamon added to the dough.  I also used a 9x9 pan and baked them 45 min.  To die for!

Where's the chocolate?  Three stars because they are extremely fast and the texture was pretty good.  I've never bought a box mix so i can't compare it but I do like dark chocolatey brownies and these were lacking flavor. I used one cup flour,only change I made.  If you want an intense rich flavor,this may not be for you. Ok in a pinch.

When I baked the brownies, I didn't have a big enough pan, so I put it in cupcake liners and make cronies. I frosted them with a very simple recipe. I left some plain and I frosted some. The frosted ones were better, actually. Great recipe though. My brother loves the cronies a lot.!

Really yummy brownies! After reading the reviews, I decided to use just one cup of flour.  I also cooked the brownies in a muffin tin because I dislike cutting brownies.  The whole recipe would make two dozen "muffins", but I cut it in half and only made twelve.  In 20 minutes at 350  they were baked perfectly!

Omg!!loved this recipe I lost my old one that I used to make all the time...i did make some changes just because  I made those changes to my old recipe instead of butter I put oil. I did put just a cup of flour like a lot of people suggested...and I added chocolate chips instead of walnuts because not everyone in my house hold like nuts?? and I put chocolate cream cheese frosting!!!! omg everyone just loved them ill probably have to make more tomorrow because the pan is almost gone lol thank you for this recipe it is now my favorite??

Great brownies, if you tweak the recipe a bit! 2 cups of sugar seemed excessive, so we used 1 -1.5 cups of brown sugar, which is enough to make them sweet. Also, we added only a dash of salt, not a spoon as the recipe called for. The brownies were soft, rich, and chocolaty. YUMSIES!!!

I didn't listen to the flour suggestion but I did substitute butter since I didn't have enough on hand. Instead I used 189 ml of canola oil and 47 ml of water.    I also added a vanilla glaze using powdered sugar, a little butter, milk and vanilla. You put it on when the Brownies are warm, let them sit in the fridge for 5 minutes to let it harden, and voila! They came out a bit lighter and a perfect texture. Not too heavy and not too cakey.

These were amazing!!! My husband likes dense  non-cakelike brownies, so I took the advice of the other cooks and used only one cup of flour. He's also a nut lover so I added  2 cups of walnuts and a cup of milk chocolate chips.
These were a hit with everyone

I normally never write a review for this stuff, but I use All Recipes often. I've made this one many times and love it! I only use 1 cup of flour as recommended by others.  It truly is quick and easy!

The recipe is good "as is", which makes them more cake-like than fudge. I substituted chocolate chips for the nuts.  I used a "brownie" cupcake pan that makes 12 individual square (brownie) cakes. It took about 25 minutes to bake. No cutting required. Just grab and go, and that's exactly what happened! No icing needed.

I am terrible at making brownies, but this recipe was very easy to follow. The batter came together in under ten minutes. I reduced the flour by about half a cup as suggested by other bakers and the brownies came out very moist and tasted great.


Tips and Tricks:
If you have a habit of overbaking your brownies like me, instead of greasing the pan line it with parchment paper to prevent  the brownies from sticking, and bake the brownies for 20 minutes uncovered then an addition 20 minutes (depending on your oven- mine in notoriously unreliable for even heating) covered with foil.  The brownies lift out of the pan without sticking and will be fully baked but remain moist and fudgy.

Made these for a 4th of July party.  Fast, easy and DELICIOUS!!!  Everyone loved them.  Used only 1 cup of flour like so many others had done so the brownies were super moist and fudgy.  I added milk chocolate and peanut butter chips as well and they were awesome.  This will be my go-to recipe for brownies going forward.

these cupcakes taste really good but we made them with all the right things and they caved in and looked like cups then the bottoms did not cook and where still batter I would give this a one star but the worst thing is that they did not taste like cupcakes more like popcorn.

I wish I would have used only one cup of the flour like everyone suggested. It probably would not face turned out like chocolate cake. Maybe next time...

This is a favorite at our house. We only use 3eggs, 1 cup flour and 1 1/2 cup sugar. They turn out great.

I found no problem with these brownie, Yes they were cake like due to the 4 eggs and as everyone said  reduce the  flour to  1 cup to  reduce dryness. This is a nice base Brownie recipe.
If you like chew brownies reduce the eggs.

Very good!  I did what other reviewers said and cut the flour down to 1 cup.  I'm not big on cake-like brownies so this was muuuuch better.  I think I'll throw in a little more cocoa next time and maybe some chocolate chips too.

Yes trying it for the first time. I tried a spicy chocolate cocoa mix instead of regular cocoa powder. Hoping for the best...looks like I need to cook for about 45-60 min.

Just made these.  They are light and chewy- prefect in my opinion.  Only thing I changed (1 cup white sugar, 1 cup organic coconut sugar). I also used 2 round cake pans instead of 9x13. Baked for 20 minutes.

I have been trying to be good at baking but so far I never succeed. At a certian point I start blaming my oven for all the mess. But this recipe was so simple and quick so I had to give a try. And Mark my word it was super quick and my brownies were the ever best brownies I have ever baked. And my boyfriend loved them. He was literally surprised. I kept the quantity of flour less as everyone else told and it worked. Thanks alot  for the recipe C.Nelson.

Quick and easy! I reduced the sugar to 1 cup brown sugar + 1/4 cup white sugar as I don't usually like very sweet desserts, used dark cocoa powder, and reduced the flour to 1 cup as per the helpful comments here :) Mixed by hand with a whisk, baked it for 25 mins, it was moist and not sickly sweet-- perfect with a scoop of ice cream! Will definitely make this again, maybe with less butter and baking it for about 22 mins instead. Thank you for the recipe!

I tried making these tonight. The flavor was great but I'd recommend only using 1 cup of flour just as the others commented. Unfortunately I didn't read the reviews beforehand and mine came out with a bread-like texture instead.

Really just an OK brownie. The chocolate flavor is weak and it's too cakey/crumbly. Reducing the flour would probably be the best remedy.

My daughter (13) made these as a surprise for my birthday.  She did an amazing job and said that they were very easy! She added chocolate chips instead of walnuts.  Side note, make sure to use semi-sweet, not milk chocolate chips. It made them almost too sweet.  But still a great recipe for someone who wants to bake but doesn't have a lot of experience.

These brownies were fabulous as long as you reduced the flour to one cup as others suggested. However this increases the cooking time to at least 30 min. I kept checking them and adding more time so I think start at 30 min. Also maybe next time I will decrease the sugar a bit. I added 1/2 cup of choc chips instead of nuts. Delicious!! 4 stars because I had to adjust recipe

Very easy and delicious! I am always concerned that homemade brownie recipes are sometimes dry so I used canola oil instead of butter. That and reducing the flour as others suggested left a perfect moist brownie!

It was my first time to cook brownies and I had recently eaten some great homemade brownies. So I decided to give it a try myself. This recipe was really fast and easy. It was delicious, not too sweet.As some other reviews advised, I only used 1 cup of flower. You should try these brownies.

This is my go-to recipe for awesome brownies. True to it's name, it is quick and easy, and also very delicious. I get nothing but compliments and requests for more. I always follow the recipe exactly, except to please my family I use pecans instead of walnuts, or leave the nuts out completely.  These brownies are as good, if not better, after they have been frozen.  Just wrap them individually in plastic wrap and put them in a large ziplock - then you can quickly satisfy a sudden brownie craving without waiting for them to bake!

These are not very chocolately. I also think 2 sticks of butter is overkill; they taste more like the fat of the butter than the chocolate.

I halved the recipe and didn't use walnuts, partly because if am not keen on nuts, mostly cause we didn't have them! They are in the oven now, it smells so gorgeous! Looks yummy and I tried the mixture on the fork I used to test it and it was to die for! Delicious, chocolatey heaven...can't wait until they are ready to eat :)

Pretty good recipe!  Follower other reviewer's suggestions to cut back on the flour, next time I will cut back by using one egg less than the recipe calls for.  Top layer was amazing, bottom layer too cake-like but that's prob a sign of over-baking.  Will definitely make again.

I love this recipe. I have made it twice, and I have made a few minor adjustments per my tastes. I changed the sugar to 1 1/2 cups because I thought you would be able to experience the chocolate a little more. It worked...I couldn't stop eating them! I also changed the prep of the walnuts; I just chopped them into a bit smaller pieces because I found that the halves were too large. All in all, a great recipe in no time at all!

I've made a lot of brownie recipes, and these were among the best. They're sort of in the middle of the cakey-to-fudgy spectrum. I ate the whole batch by myself, over about a week. For some reason they tasted better and better - maybe refrigeration helped the texture? My only regret was that I didn't grease the pan enough - the brownies stuck to it quite a bit.

Simply amazing! I did omit 1/2 cup of flour like some other reviewers and instead of walnut I generously sprinkled sliced almonds on top prior to baking then wah-lah! My husband and his co-worker loved it. My husband finished 2/3 of the brownies all by himself in 2 days O_O;

This recipe is perfect as written. I can't understand why people are changing it. They taste wonderful, the texture is between fudgy and cakey, which is perfect to me. The process could not be easier. I melted the butter in a 6 cup pyrex measuring cup and then just added the ingredients to it.  I used a restaurant pan to bake them in which is the same width as the usual pan but an inch or 2 shorter. That may have made for a slighter thicker brownie. This is a keeper!

First time I made this recipe: I did as the other reviewers said and used 1 cup of flour opposed to 1 1/2. I also omitted 1/2 cup of walnut halves and instead added milk chocolate chocolate chips (about a handful). I didn't add the 1/2 teaspoon of salt since I used half unsalted butter and half margarine (which is a bit salty). The rest of the instruction I followed precisely as they were on the given recipe. I baked the brownies for exactly 45 minutes and they came out absolutely delicious.
Second time I made this recipe: I used an 8inx8in pan. I didn't use any measuring utensils but here are the estimates. I used about 3/4 flour, however, I feel I should have used 1/2 flour. I used 1 cup sugar. Instead of butter I used coconut oil, 1/2 cup. 3 eggs, however, I feel I should have used 2 eggs. 1/4 cup cocoa powder, 1/4 teaspoon baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract. No salt. No nuts or chocolate chips. I baked for 23 minutes, however, I feel I should have baked for a couple minutes less. With this one I felt the brownies came out cakey. Next time I make this in an 8x8 pan I will add less flour (1/2 cup) and one less egg (2 eggs). The brownies were also a bit coconuty (which I don't mind but family does) so instead I will go back to using real butter since I think it gives it a more brownie like taste. Apart from that this recipe is great. I've tried a few other recipes from this site (exact: no alterations) and none can compete with this one.

Best brownies I have ever made!! I made these with the amount of flour it called for and I thought they were perfect, however I do not like my brownies real "gooey". My husband, daughter and I are in agreement that this is the new favorite brownie recipe!!

I read a lot of the reviews and decreased the flour as suggested. This resulted in lengthening the bake time from 30 to 40 minutes.  They are definitely not cake like. Not bad but I will be trying other recipes to find the "right" one.

Very yummy. I reduced flour by 2 tablespoons as other reviewers suggested. These were great! As a general rule we prefer more fudgy style but these were a huge hit, easy to make, and I usually have all of these ingredients on hand. I did sprinkle top with powdered sugar but mostly for looks. Will make again and use this as base recipe to play around with. Thanks!

Easiest recipe ever!  I followed the recipe exactly as is written, and the brownies came out delicious.  My son took them to school as his birthday treat for his classroom.  The brownies were moist and chocolatey.  If I wanted them more chocolatey, I wouldn't reduce the flour -- I would add chocolate morsels.  I took me thirty minutes to produce the final product.  Ten minutes combining ingredients, and 20 to bake it.  I didn't add the nuts because not all kids like nuts.  I plan on using this recipe for brownies when I make my brownie/ice cream/hot fudge dessert. 

Yum and thanks!

i made this with one cup of flour as the users below suggested.  I would change a few other things though. 1. Too buttery. A whole cup is a little too much. 3/4 cup or 7/8 cups would be better. 2. too sugary. 1 3/4 cups is better. Also it didn't end up with the crackle and shiny surface. Plus I cooked it for 35 minutes and it was barely enough. Wonder why.

I've made these several times now.  Like others have suggested I decreased the flour to just 1 cup and decreased the eggs to just 3.  These are excellent!  I usually add about a half cut of chocolate chips to the batter before baking and frost them with a chocolate cream cheese frosting.  YUMMO!!

Mmmm an easy winner! I halved the recipe and used 3/4 Cup of self raising flour. I also sprinkled slivered almonds on top prior to baking. Oooh and I had run out of vanilla so used a dash of peppermint essence. A keeper!

Very delicious and moist.  I lined my glass baking dish with foil (coated lightly with cooking spray) for a clean and easy removal of the brownies.  Unfortunately I only had pecans on hand, but it still tasted great.   I also added 1/2 cup of miniature marshmallows for a Rocky Road twist.   If you like a firmer, chewy texture I recommend baking them for the full 30 minutes.

The recipe went very well. However, in the beginning I was a bit concerned about the amount of sugar used, but it all turned out deliciously well in the end. I highly recommend this recipe to others who want a quick treat that is easy  to make. Also, you may want to reduce the flour to one cup it turns out much better. Thanks!

I gather the reviews that suggest adding extra cocoa powder for a darker, more chocolatey brownie were using a light grade of cocoa powder. Cocoa powders are graded by their % fat; we used a 20% cocoa powder (a "rich cocoa" grade) and 3/4 cup. The brownie batter is extremely dark and tasted very, very chocolatey. We also reduced the# of eggs from 4 to 3, using extra large eggs, to make them more fudgy and less cakey, and baked them in a 13 x 9 inch glass dish.

They came out very cakey even with 3 eggs vs 4, chocolatey, and light (weight and texture, not color). Will try next time with 1 cup of flour and 2 eggs to get a more fudgy consistency.

Very, very fast and easy with a kitchen aid mixer.

Tried This Recipe Just Moments Ago, I did what other reviewers said instead of 4 eggs I used 2 eggs, I uped the cocoa powder to 3/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup and used 1 cup of flour instead of the 1 1/2 cup it required. They came absolutely delicious,  they where moist, chewy and chocolatey. Fiancée loved them,  Definitely makig these over and over again !

Very good but traditionally, brownies have no leavening agent so no need for the baking powder!

These brownies were absolutely awful. I bake a lot! and I love baking. At least one new recipe a day, and I've used at least a dozen brownie recipes. I followed the directions, used 1 cup of flour as many people suggested...and the brownies came out very fudge-y, and WAY TOO SWEET!

followed the recipe exactly, and ended up with chocolate cake. I then made a second batch for 10 servings instead of 20, added 1 egg, 1/2 cup of flour, more chocolate... and it is so perfect. LOL hi five me!

I used this recipe to bake brownies for my hubby and he said they were the best brownies he has ever eaten. This was my first attempt at baking homemade brownies. I did decrease the flour to 1 cup as others had suggested. I am looking forward to baking them again. :)

I decreased the flour to 1 cup and used 3 eggs. These were the absolute BEST brownies. They were fudgy and didn't last very long in my house. Will definitely make again. The cook time was closer to 40 minutes.

I just made these for my son's last day of preschool. I only used 1 cup of flour for a more chewy brownie, and they turned out great! I was able to cut them easily, and they aren't too sweet which I like. When I make them again, I'll add extra cocoa for more chocolate flavour.

We loved it!Sometimes we omit the cocoa powder and we have vanilla brownies.We also always split the sugar in half and omit the salt.Also, never use an electric mixer. then they come out to much like cake.Just mix it with a spoon.:-)

Just came out of the oven, the smell awesome, but seem a bit cakey, and I was hoping for more of a fudge-like texture.  But, still great!

This was my first attempt at making these brownies and I am very happy to say they came out great! I know that the kids at the middle school are going to love them! I had to make 100 serving so i multiplied the recipe by 5 and by doing so I noticed that I need to add more liquid, so I added 1 cup of milk to the recipe. They are VERY MOIST! I am looking forward to sharing this recipe with the others at the school. :) Thank You.

These are absolutely wonderful. I don't do boxed mixes, so I'm always looking for a "new and improved" recipe. This is perfect. They are so quick and easy to make, and taste delicious.

I used this recipe for a chocolate trifle, and I could not have used better brownies.

I just made these and snuck a piece to make sure they're okay before I bring them to a family event. ;)
I reduced the flour to 1 cup as other reviewers suggested and I also added a handful of semi-sweet choc. chips.  The bake time was longer than expected... my oven isn't the most powerful so at first I put them in for 27 mins. then another 4 and then an additional 4..! The texture of these brownies is great. Not too soft and not too fudgey. I'd add more choc. chips or something because the chocolate taste is a bit lacking. These are a good base brownie. I'm going to make these again and again and experiment by adding different ingredients! The title doesn't lie, these are super easy.

I used mini muffin cups and baked for 20 mins. It came out perfect! Had a chewy texture and tasted very chocolatey as I added some chocolate chips instead of nuts. It was too sweet when it just came out of the oven but got less sweeter when cooled. Great recipe!

I tried the recipe and added 2T. powdered coffee. I really love the flavor it gave to the chocolate; its a wonderful contrast against the sweet notes. Make sure the instant coffee is something you like to drink personally.

Quick and easy recipe, loved the fact that it was a cake- like brownie. My husband absolutely loved these, not too sweet and not heavy. I saw some comments that it didn't have a very strong chocolate flavor, personally for me it was a perfect balance and you can always add frosting on the top for more sweetness and chocolate flavor. I did not have any other flour than self rising flour and it came out just fine. I had some left-over chocolate chips so I added a little over a 1/4 of a cup to the mix. As other reviewers had stated I had to up the cooking time (by approx. 10 mins.)

I've made this recipe a million times now and it is honestly the BEST brownies i have ever had. Not too dry not too gooey. Only thing i changed was instead of walnuts i put chocolate chips and it is soooo good!

Super delicious and buttery, refrigerate to keep most and cut into bite size prices to heat up. I also used raw sugar when I made them, but I'm not sure if it made a difference or not.

Very good cakey brownie, which I prefer; the kid prefers fudgy brownies but that did not stop her from eating three of these in about 15 minutes! This recipe is a keeper.

Batter is really good if you like to eat it without cooking it, but they come out very gooey. I am going to try reducing the egg or adding a little more flour to see if I can get the consistency better.

I give this recipe 4 stars without the modifications and 5 with the modifications.  This recipe is fabulous.  Everytime I make them people beg for the recipe and, I admit, I sometimes pass it off as my own personal recipe.  I reduce the flour to 1 cup because we like gooey, fudgy brownies in this house.  I also add variety by throwing in chocolate chips or cranberries in place of nuts.  This recipe is very versitile and practically fool proof.  I love it.  Thank you for sharing.

I have made this recipe twice. The first time I made it as is, they were good but more cake-like than I prefer. The second batch is in the oven and I used 3 eggs instead of 4 and less flour.. will update with results!

I love how easy this recipe is! The taste and texture were fine, but not great. They weren't really "fudgey" like box brownies.  On the bright side, no chemicals like box brownies. Next time I might try adding a little vegetable oil. Also, perhaps it was the cocoa powder (I used Hershey's), but the flavor was missing something. Maybe more vanilla next time and/or brown sugar instead of white?

These turn out super great every time and it's nice not having to melt chocolate down! I also reduced the flour, and line the pan with parchment paper (makes them easy to take out of the pan and less cleanup)! Brought them to work, and I got several people asking for the recipe and even to marry me! Must try!

As did other reviews- I left out 1/2 a cup of flour and these are terrific!!  Added a 1 cup of butterscotch chips and it was super yummy.  We have always been brownie lovers but never tried to make them from scratch before.  Box brownies just seemed too easy.  But now I will never buy a box again :)These brownies are just too easy and fast.  We like our brownies a little on the gooey side...so 24 minutes was Perfect!

Made these for my aunt's rehearsal dinner party. They were a hit; EVERYONE loved them! I added a touch of instant coffee to the batter and swirled some caramel sauce over the top before baking. I was worried these were going to be too cake-like, but I kept a really close eye on them and stopped baking them when they no longer 'jiggled' in the middle. They were VERY fudge and very good! Will definitely make these again!

My husband really like the cake style of brownies.  This is the perfect recipe for that.  I make it exactly as it is written except I replace the walnuts with mini chocolate chips.  This makes them extra chocolatey.

I prepared the recipe as shown except I left out both the baking powder and the walnuts, and spooned about a half cup of melted PEANUT BUTTER to the top and swirled it before baking... BEST BROWNIES EVER!!! - also, I baked them for about 20 minutes on 350 and noticed they were still a little runny in the middle, so I decreased the heat down to 300 and baked them for another 20 minutes and they turned out perfect!

These brownies were delicious everyone loved them. I thought they were good but could've been better but I am very picky. For starters when i first took the brownies out of the oven they came out very airy and cake-like and I like my brownies a little more like soft cookies. I only added 1 cup of flour as other reviewrers suggested so maybe that's why but I don"t know. Also I thought they should have been chocolatier but I used starbucks hot cocoa powder instead of regular cocoa powder. After letting the brownies cool for a bit they became more cookie like but they were a little hard. Other than that the brownies were great!

I attempted these brownies in a halved batch - the flavour was good, but I found the texture too cakey and soft. I prefer a more dense, chewy brownie, so this recipe isn't for me.

My kids asked me twice if these were homemade because they didn't believe me.  I have bought The quick mix brownies from the grocery store so many times.  These were a winner with everyone. (decrease flour to 1 cup).

This is a cake-like brownie.  If you are looking for fudgy, this isn't the recipe for you.  However, it is good.  If I make these again I'll be sure to frost them.

Excellent recipe. I also used 1 cup of flour. I think I'll try 3 eggs and 3/4 cup butter next time. I used 1 cup of flaked coconut for a yummy twist as other reviewers have noted. Maybe I didn't wait long enough for these to cool (waited an hour), because they crumbled when I cut and took them out of the pan (9 x 13). But again, it's an over-all yummy and perfectly chocolatey recipe!

The taste was delicious from the moment I added the cocoa (I continually sample what I make...). I think I messed up somewhere, maybe it's because I didn't account for a higher altitude or because I halved it and put it in a 9x9 pan, since I don't have 8x8. The texture was just a little bit funny and the middle was extremely thin. I added less flour as others suggested, but I might try adding a bit more and perhaps omitting the baking powder, since I haven't seen it in hardly any brownie recipes anyway.
Loved the taste, though, and they really were quick and easy!

I made these last night and they were pretty good. I used the recipe as a base and changed it a bit based on other comments and recommendations. I used 1 1/2 cup of sugar, 3/4 cup cocoa powder, no vanilla (because I didn't have any) and 1 cup of self rising flour. And I also threw in a few chocolate chips. I think next time I will only put in 2 or 3 eggs. They were pretty good, I would use as a cake though.

My fiance had a late-night brownie craving, and this recipe was just what I needed to make my future-hubby happy!  Brownies were still cakey, despite using 1 cup of flour as suggested.  I also used 3/4 cup of cocoa, 1 1/2 cups sugar, and added some peanut butter chips to the mix.  To make them fudgier I may use fewer eggs next time.  Quick and easy recipe--no more store-bought brownie mixes for me!

These were fantastic.  I followed recipe exactly.  I covered my 9x13 pan with foil and sprayed it, easy cleanup.  I added walnuts plus 1 cup of chocolate chips and it turned out delicious!  Soft and very moist.  Each guest I served it to went back from seconds!  Definitely easy and I will be baking my brownies from scratch from now on!

I made the brownies per the recipe except using 1 cup flour instead of 1 1/2 cups plus I used pecans instead of walnuts.  They were a fudgy brownie - not very thick and my husband loved them.   I also put chocolate frosting on them with additional chopped pecans. It is definitely a keeper for our family.

Fantastic recipe.  I've made it several times, and the only change I do is 1 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.

These were awesome, made them with my 3 year old.  Left out the walnuts because of her and had them with vanilla ice cream.  I used the full amount of flour and liked that they were "cakey".  Make no mistake, they are more brownie than cake though, in a good way.  Enjoy!

This is a great recipe, quick and easy just as it says. I like a more cake-like brownie. My grandchildren however like them more fudge-like so to alter just a bit I only used the 1 cup of flour as suggested by others and added smuckers sundae syrup to the batter. My grandchildren loved em said they were the best brownies I have ever made.

I picked this recipe for my daughter because it looked easy. And it IS REALLY EASY. We followed the recipe exactly except we left out the walnuts. These are just ok. Too cakey. Not enough chocolate flavor. A bit too sweet. Its an ok basic recipe but it needs to be tweaked.

Wasn't expecting these to be as good as they are because they were soooo easy to make, but they were delicious! I used 1 cup of self-rising flour and  so it was even easier to make, since I didn't have to add salt and baking powder.

Excellent brownies. As the title states, they were incredibly quick and easy to make. I topped them with a fudgy frosting and my family and I dug in, and we were all very pleased with the result. As per other reviewers' suggestions I used only 1 cup of flour--great taste and perfect consistency, not cake-like at all. This has become my go-to brownie recipe.

anything with 2 CUPS of sugar and 1 CUP of butter is typically going to taste good, but these taste more like sugar cookies then rich chocolate brownies im used to eating. Not enough chocolate and way too much sugar.

This recipe is foolproof! I only had one cup of AP flour so that's all I used. Also, I didn't have any walnuts, so in went 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, mmmm! I was in a rush to make these, so I needed them to only cook for 20 minutes. I set the oven to 375, and raised it to 400 about half way through. The edges were a little stiff, but the rest was SO good. These were a hit at the bakesale, and I have to say are THE BEST brownies I've made from scratch!!! People came up to me for days after asking me to make these again :)

I made these brownies this very evening and I have to say that my boyfriend was chuffed to bits! he said they were absolutely perfect :) I followed other reviews and reduced flour to 1 cup, and used chopped dark chocolate instead of walnuts, delicious. These are my 1st brownies ever. Mom and sister satisfied as well. Thank you for this amazing recipe. :)

Last night was the second time I've baked this recipe in the last few weeks and it was just as good as the first time.  Thank you for sharing this easy "go to" recipe for brownies.  I don't need another one & will probably never buy the box versions again.

These were delicious!  I didn't change anything with the ingredients.  I did bake mine in a 9 inch square pan instead of the 9 x 13 because I like a thicker brownies. I added about 8 more minutes to the bake time.  They were moist for several days after baking. Also very simple! Thank Goodness!

I left out the walnuts and added a few spoonfuls of peanut butter after I poured the brownies in the pan and swirled it in a little bit.  They were FABULOUS!  Will definately make again soon!

I followed the recommendation of the other posts and used only one cup of flour and the brownies came out great!!!!! The brownies have a melt in your mouth taste!!!! The only thing that I would have preferred is for more fudge/chocolate. Other than that this was an easy recipe!!!!

I needed a recipe for brownies that was quick, easy, and preferably used cocoa as opposed to baking chocolate. Following this recipe, and the advice of other reviewers to reduce the amount of flour to one cup, yielded brownies that were rich and fudgy. The thin crust complemented the soft, dense texture, and the slightly bitter undertones of the chopped walnuts provided a nice balance to the sugar, as well as supplying crunch . 

Surprisingly, these brownies are not overly sweet, and a dusting of confectioners sugar added a perfect - and simple - flourish.

I used a 9x13 pan as the recipe recommended and found that the brownies were the perfect thickness. Baking took 20 minutes.

Have been using Brooke's Bombshell Brownies, but found the top "crust" too thick and hard. So gave these a try...EXCELLENT!! Just the right amount of sweetness, but I did increase the cocoa to 2/3 cup and next time I will decrease the flour a little. This is a definite keeper recipes.

Very moist and easy to make.  This is the best from scratch recipe I've tried.  My four yr. old helped and we had it mixed in no time.  I made exactly by recipe except used pecans instead of walnuts.

I have no idea what went wrong. I had to bake these brownies for almost an hour before the knife came out clean, and the edges and the top layer were so hard and crunchy. The taste was good, but nothing exceptional. Definitely not the best. I'm sorry, but for me and my family, this recipe is not a keeper.

This recipe is a hit with my friends and family!  My most successful variation included substituting half the cocoa powder with a square of unsweetened baking chocolate (I ran out of cocoa.)  The middle stayed very fudgey and they were DELICIOUS frozen.  I topped them with mini chocolate chips before I put them in the oven.  This is my go-to brownie recipe!

So this is my first time making homemade brownies and they are still not ready! It has been over 35 minutes...I hope they will be okay. I did forget to add salt, but I don't think that will effect the overall brownie or the cooking time. Anyways, wish me luck : )

I made these almost exactly as directed except I forgot to melt the butter (mixed it well with an electric mixer).  They still turned out perfect and delicious.  The kids and I loved this. As a mom of four this is a quick made from scratch recipe that I will def. use again and again.  Thank you so much!

These were the easiest Brownies to make! Almost as easy as using a box mix. They took a total of about 35 minutes to make (that includes prep). I did what those before me did and only used 1 cup of flour. Let me tell you, those are chewy, delicious brownies! I will use this recipe from now on! NO MORE BOXED BROWNIES FOR ME!

These brownies did not disappoint...or last very long! I followed the recipe exactly except cut the flour back to 1 cup and threw in some chocolate chips as suggested by other reviewers.  With the exception of my mom's brownies, these are the best I have EVER had! Best of all they definitely don't need icing...usually my least favourite part of making brownies.  Will definitely make again : )

I made these brownies as written, I just added some chocolate syrup. When I was mixing the batter, it got super fluffy, and it nearly filled the whole 9x13. I baked them for about 30 minutes, which is a long time in my oven, and they came all the way to the top of the pan. They were thick and cakey, with a crispy top. They tasted good...not the best ever, but good. I think with some chocolate chips or frosting these could be really great, they came out so thick and fluffy!

I cooked these 10 minutes longer than the called for time and still they were not done in the middle.  aI thought they were flavorless.  They didn't have a very good chocolate flavor and were way too squishy.  I have no idea how people are making these with only 1 C of flour and liking them.  They seemed raw with the full amount of flour.  Not fudgy at all and certainly not cake-y.  I do not recommend this recipe at all.

These brownies were very easy to make.  They tasted great.  The dough was somewhat stiff but they still turned out beautifully.

I gorged. Ate an entire row in the 9x13 pan of these guys :) This is actually my first brownie recipe (from scratch) that I've made, and they have turned out wonderfully. Like the other reviews said, I too used only one cup of flour. I also added a pinch of cinnamon and cayenne...and it gave the mix a subtle heat that rests on your tongue with the chocolate. Overall, these deserve a 5 out of 5. Light, fluffy, very chocolately, and just plain delicious!

I found these to be too cake like and with a strong butter flavor. I added chocolate chips to get more chocolate flavor, but they still didn't have a very rich chocolate recipe.

Easy, fast, and adaptable if you are short on something... I agree with reducing the flour by about half a cup for truly fudgey brownies... A hit every time!

Holy  these are good.  This was also my fiance's response.  The batter was amazing, so I had high hopes, but these are moist, chewy, chocolately, crunchy on top-perfect brownies! Yum! I also just used 1 cup of flour, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was very easy-I just mixed by hand.

Three stars for moist and chewy texture, but I can't give it five due to the overpowering buttery flavor. They were ok, but not great or as brownie like as desired.

Changes: used 1 cup flour in total, 1/2 cup of all purpose and 1/2 cup of whole wheat. I was shocked at the amount of sugar in the recipe... I usually use twice as much sugar as cocoa powder. I want to taste food, not sugar. So, I halved the sugar. Brownies were soft, moist, and chocolaty. How did everyone else make it with 2x the sugar?!

I thought this was terrible but--based on all of the other great reveiws--something must have gone wrong!  Not sure what...I did sub 1/2 c of the butter for 1/2 c applesauce, and used slightly less than the amount of called-for flour, but they were super cake-y, bland, and just not good.  My husband and I each had one and didn't finish the rest.

Even though I decreased the amount of flour used, they still turned out really cakey. Next time I'll also have to cut back on the baking powder, I guess.

This was a wonderful recipe however i altered it as well.  I am not a fan of walnuts so instead I added four or five heaping spoonfuls of chunky peanut butter.  I added just a little more sugar and a little less salt and I added about 1/4 a cup or more of milk.  with the full one and a half cups flour it was a little too cake like for me but with only one cup it was too moist and falling apart because of the added liquid.  a happy medium worked wonders though, about 1 and 1/4 c. when they were done my roommate had gotten lots of strawberry's and i sliced them and layed them on top as i ate it.  It was heavenly.  But overall this recipe was wonderful, quick, easy, and delectable.

These are very good brownies and I'm sure I'll make them again because they are one-bowl easy.  They have a good flavor and texture but they aren't the best I've ever had.  Everyone in the family is in agreement that they are very good!

They turned out ok. Much too cake-likem even though i added less flour. I did one batch with powdered sugar and it was really bland. So i did another with some home-made icing and they were better. Not my favorite though.

Very easy to make, whipped it up together with my two year-old who definitely liked the batter! haha!  The main thing that I liked about this recipe is the fact that it is easy to make with those basic ingredients that a person usually has laying around the house.  I wanted a chocolatey fix and rummaged in my cupboards (and rummaged online) and this is what I found.  I definitely prefer brownies on the fudgy side so I went with the 1 cup flour as suggested (although I halved the recipe so actually used 1/2 cup flour).  It was sooo good.  I omitted the nuts and sprinkled a few choco chips on top of the batter before baking.  According to my daughter "YUMMY BROWNIE!"

These were easy. I decreased the flour to one cup but they still weren't fudgey enough for me. I also decreased the sugar to one and a quarter cup and that worked out well. The only thing I really didn't like was the fact that they tasted too much like butter.

I think box brownies are one of the only things that taste better NOT homemade but since I didnt have a box I tried this recipe. It is the only homemade recipe for brownies that we actually have liked. Its very good. I did cut down the flour to 1 cup like others have suggested but had to increase the baking time a little. Very good, quick & easy :)

I tried this recipe tonight and I have to say, it was amazingly quick and came out surprisingly awesome. However, due to the fact that neither my family nor I are crazy about anything mega sweet, I decided to cut the sugar back to about 1 1/4 cup. I also added a little extra cocoa than what was called for, and even added some Chocolate Peppermint liquor for flavor, omitting one of the eggs in place. It was super quick and delicious, will definitely use this recipe again in the future with some modifications.

I made these brownies just as the recipe said, but I left out the nuts. Everyone enjoyed the brownies, especially right out of the oven. I would not recommend this recipe for someone who wants a fudgy brownie. These brownies were more cake-like, and not too chocolatey. I liked them, but will pass on this recipe in the future in favor of a more dense brownie.

I have tweaked the add ins (instead of nuts, I've used andes mint chips, or have added almond extract and topped with raspberry cream, ...  my favorite is to sub the nuts with a cup of chocolate chips.) They are always perfect and they double nicely, just use a jelly roll size pan, and you have enough for a crowd.  This one is a KEEPER!  Thanks for sharing!

Awesome! I even forgot the salt and they still turned out really good. I undercooked them on purpose because I like them a little gooey, and used peanut butter chips. They didn't last very long in my house :)

This brownie tasted good, but was too crunchy on the top and edges for me.  I ended up baking it for close to 45 minutes at the temp recommended.  After reading the reviews I reduced the flour to 1 1/4 cups (I like cake-y and my husband likes fudgey - good compromise) and I added about 1 cup of mint chocolate chips and used pecans instead of walnuts.  My husband really liked this recipe, so I may try again, adjusting for high altitude (I live at about 6000 ft) and adjusting the temp a bit.  I really enjoy brownies from a box, so I'm going to continue to search for a recipe that's more similar to that taste.  But good homemade recipe!

These are delicious, but definitely use only 1 cup flour!  They are not too dense, so it's a great brownie for adding chocolate pieces. My bake time (glass 13x9 pan) was 40 minutes, so a bit longer than expected, but worth it.

Definitely QUICK and EASY and great when you only have basic ingredients around the house but want a chocolate treat!  They were slightly cakelike but after reading reviews I have noticed lots of people decreased the flour, and i think I may try that. However, I still loved the recipe making it the way it was listed!  My husband and I pulled from the oven and ate an entire 8x8 pan of them while warm on Valentines day with a tall glass of milk. yumyum!

These brownies came out amazing. I didn't have a 9x13 inch pan but I used an 8x8. I only baked half the recipe but, they still came out prefect. I'll definitely use this recipe again! Thanks!

Do NOT mix after adding each ingredient - the final product will turn out over mixed and stuck to the pan.  Simply combine all of the ingredients and stir.  I made that mistake.  They tasted OK but I'm not sure if I'll make them again.

These are GREAT!  And so fast!  I gave 4 stars only b/c I also used less flour (1 cup) and I think they would be better if I added 1 cup of chocolate chips.  I'll do that next time.  Thanks again!

Yummy!  I cut down the flour to one cup, as others suggested, and the brownies came out very fudgy.  I might try it with the full cup and a half next time.  The other changes I made were to substitute  chocolate chips for the walnuts, add 1/2 c peanut butter chips, and cut down the butter to 1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cup).  I give them five stars because they were so easy, fast, delicious, and got very few dishes dirty!

This was an awesome recipe. I followed the suggestion of using just one cup of flour and then added a whole cup of walnuts.They were awesome and so much better than the box mixes.

This recipe is such a family pleaser.  My children, who are extremely finicky about their dessert treats begged for more.    As others suggested, I reduced the amount of flour down to one cup.  Also, I chopped up a solid chocolate Santa from a Christmas stocking and added it to the batter.    They were mixed in no more than five minutes and were a perfect treat to get together in a pinch.  I made them while making dinner!

The perfect brownie! I use this recipe, minus the walnuts,  for the Brownie Chocolate Chip Cheesecake also listed on this site and it turns out great! There's also enough left over for some brownies to munch on before the cake is done. Will be making this one time and time again!

Also used 1 cup flour, and was pleased with the outcome. These were the first brownies I have made from scratch and everyone was delighted. They kept for about a week and stayed quite moist and flavorful in tupperware.

I did just as others did by adding only one cup of flour, as this made them nice and fudgy. But for some reason, they seem to be missing something. They are good, but not great. It could be the use of cocoa instead of choc. squares, but that's why I tried this recipe. I didn't have any choc. squares

I took the advice from previous reviews and added just 1 cup of flour. I also added 1 cup of chocolate chips (semisweet and milk chocolate). They were amazing! And I have already been asked for the recipe. Great choice!

These were just OK. I was hoping for a more intense chocolate flavor. I used high quality dutch-processed cocoa, but the flavor was just not as rich as I was hoping for. They were a bit better the next day, but I don't think I'll make them again.

I just baked these. They took about an hour to fully bake. There was a "shell" on top which immediately sank except for around the edges of the pan. Top is very crumbly and not as fudgy as i expected even with 1c flour as others suggested. Tastes fine and minimal ingredients. Most likely will not make again.

Here are the changes I made due to not having everything on hand: 1.5 cups of dark brown sugar, 1.5 cups of butter, 1 cup of flower, baking soda instead of baking powder. So, obviously I am reviewing the recipe based on ALL those substitutions and changes...and it still turned out very well. It has a very slight aftertaste, that is probably due to the baking soda, and it is more cakey that I usually like, but it is good otherwise!

These brownies were terrific, but I did make a lot of changes from reading the reviews.  By changing them, they tasted fudgey with a top you normally get while making brownies.  Nice, chewy and delicious!  I only added 1 1/2 cups sugar.  I cut the butter back to a 1/2 cup + 5 Tbs.  I added 3 eggs, 1 cup flour and cut the salt back to 1/4 tsp.  I did not add walnut halves, but I added semi sweet chocolate chips to the mix.  I baked them in a glass 9X13 pan for 30 minutes, and they came out perfect.

It's more of a "cake" recipe and not even a good one. I agree with everyone else, less flour. But honestly even with less flour they don't have much taste.

They were quick and easy.  Don't ease up on the flour though (like I did) if you're at a higher elevation.  Mine kind of sunk down in the middle, but they were tasty.

These were fabulous!  My daughter notified me around 9 p.m. that she needed brownies for school the next day.  I never made brownies from scratch before but I did not want to go out (It was freezing outside!) and I knew I probably had the ingredients.  My dish is 10x15 so I changed the servings to 25.  However I did not increase the flour and I added chocolate chips. They came so moist and chewy.  My daughter said her classmates were giving her hugs to give to me!  Thank you!!

I´m from Barranquilla, Colombia and brownies here are ok. After doing this easy recipe I was so happy because they were delicious. My husband whose very picky said they were delicious.  And its much better with only 1 cup of flour.

This was one of those moments that it was 9:30 at night and my current pregnancy craving was brownies.  Having no easy box stuff on hand, the hubbie and I whipped these together.  They were ok, but came out kinda cakey, and I am a fudgy fan.  Next time I will try less flour.

This recipe did not turn out for me at all! I will try this recipe again exactly like writte but for the first try I decreased the flour to 1 cup like others had suggested and I added chocolate chips to the batter. The tops of my brownies burnt and under that was totally raw. I live in Colorado where there is the factor of high altitude so I will try to find a way to make it work for Colorado altitude. I will write another review when I try the recipe as is.

Yes, they were quick and easy, but they score low because they were also mediocre and overly buttery.  Not my favorite.

My 7 and 10 year old made these (with supervision) and they turned out nice. They are very easy and taste pretty good too. We added Christmas sprinkles to make them festive for a cookie tray.

YUM! We devoured these! I only used 1 cup of flour as others suggested, because I like brownies to be less cakey and more on the gooey side (but they're still not gooey, it's a perfect balance!) I cooked mine just a little longer than 30 minutes in a glass dish and they were perfect. They look great too and are easy to frost unlike some brownie recipes. YUM YUM YUM. I'm making more for a party this weekend. :D

Such an EASY recipe that my kids love!  This is perfect for last minute school functions & get-to-gethers, since I always have these ingredients lying around and it takes very littel time to prepare.  It's also easy to modify with add-ins...my last batch included chocolate chips (yum).  Two thumbs up!

This was my first time making non-box mix brownies.  They were super easy to make, and delicious!  Like other reviewers, I cut the flour down to 1c and had nice fudgy brownies.  No more box mixes for me!

This recipe is amazing!! I just made these for my best friend who is training at Ft. Benning, GA and I KNOW he will LOVE them.  I doubled the recipe but only used 2 cups of flour instead of 3 and they turned out soooo great!! Thanks so much for the fab recipe, I will keep it forever!

very tasty! I was going to buy a box of brownie mix, but this was easier. I had to bake for 50 min, in 8x8 pan to cook them though. I also did only 1 cup flour, & added some chopped pecans. Definitely a keeper!

I made this brownie for my kids confirmation class this past week and all the brownies went. This is more of a cake brownie, which I like more, vs. a fudgy brownie. I will make this one again.

These were ok.  I am giving it 4 stars because I can't follow the exact recipe- I had to use shortening instead of butter because of a dairy allergy.  I also omitted the nuts b/c of an allergy.  I used 1 c of flour as others suggested and still found it to be too cake-like.  This could be due to the shortening though.  I also didn't find these to be the fudgy, chocolate taste that I love in brownies.  Again, this could be due to the butter being left out.

These were sooooo good! Nice and chewy and fudgy just how I like them. I also reduced the flour to   1 Cup as others instructed, and added peanut butter chips. WONDERFUL RECIPE! These will be my go to brownies from now on.

I will NEVER buy boxed brownies again!  Followed the recipe exactly, maybe I put 1/8 of a cup more of chocolate in it, but otherwise followed to the tee!!  And wow, these brownies are so yummy!!  So simple, but they taste like HEAVEN!!  I love the butter flavor!  Thanks for sharing!!

Mine took FOREVER to bake. I had it in a 9x13 pan and it took about an hour to bake. However, everyone did love them! Though my ended up having a hard, crispy top layer...? It didn't take away from the taste at all, but I don't know why that happened and I don't think that was SUPPOSED to happen. Though all the same, I have been asked to make them again a couple times!

As written, these are pretty tasty but I'm going to take the other reviewers' suggestion next time and cut the flour to 1 cup.  Hopefully that will make them less cakey.

Love the one bowl, quick, last minute treat.  I'm always trying to reduce the calories and fat in desserts.  I try not to alter a recipe the first time I make it but went 1/2 c butter and 1/3 c apple sauce and it came out fine, really moist.

This is by far the simplest brownie recipe I've found to date. I made a triple for a group of friends and they loved them. I left out the nuts and used butter flavor Crisco in lew of the real thing and they were delicious! I think next time I make them I will include 1/4 C or espresso powder for a more intense flavor.

This recipe was so easy and tasty. It is also easy to manipulate. I have made it a few different ways. Once with raspberries and white chocolate in it, and one with apple sauce instead of butter!

The flavor and texture of these are perfect.  They rise beautifully with a thin glossy brownie crust.  The only trouble I'm having is that they sink & crack in the middle as they are cooling.  I have tried: a) making sure the butter isn't too soft, b) mixing gently so as to not whip too much air into the eggs.  I used a 9 x 13 Pyrex pan coated with cooking oil spray.  Suggestions?

I wanted this to be yummy...but it just wasn't tasty enough.  It was a bland cake like taste!  I think either more sugar or more cocoa...maybe both!

This has been my go-to brownie recipe for quite some time now. However, I never rated it since the title of the brownie says it all: Quick and Easy, and redundant isn't helpful. However, never had I truly appreciated that title more than when I was asked to bake a very large quantity of brownies for a school event--and one evening to do it.Based on previous reviews, I make the following changes: 1 1/2 Tsp. vanilla; 1 Cup Flour; 3 eggs. Great recipe!

These were cake-like in texture. Also, they didn't have that crackle top that good brownies have. But the flavor was good.

I have never written a review before (although there are many awesome recipes on this site), but I couldn't resist this one.  These brownies were probably the best I have ever had!  I have been in seach of the perfect brownie receipe and I think I have found it!    A couple very minor changes I made.  I sifted the cocoa power before putting it in the mixer so there where no lumps; I used 1 c. of flour like some reviewers said and I only used 3 eggs.  They came out perfectly.  Mine took the full 30 min. to bake in a 13x9 pan.    Thanks for the recipe!

My husband liked them, but I used two 9x9 pans. Hubby does not like, cakie brownies and I see they would have in the regular pan. Less flour next time and I think my quest for the prefect brownie recipe is over!!

I followed someone else's suggestion to only put one cup of flour, but they still came out more like a cake than a brownie.  I also put half a cup of oil and half a cup of applesauce instead of the butter.  I also dumped in about three times as much cocoa powder as the recipe calls for, tasting it along the way to make sure it was chocolatey enough - I think otherwise it would have been too sweet.  The taste is very good (with the added cocoa powder) - I think next time I would put fewer eggs to make it less cakelike, and then it would probably be really good.

These were okay, but as mentioned in other reviews - they are more like a rich, dense cake. I loaded mine with chocolate chips, which always helps. This isn't my favorite recipe for regular brownies, **however** - it makes an amazing brownie crust for cheesecakes. (baked on a large cookie sheet and cut to springform size)

My idead of the perfect brownie. I know most people prefer the really gooey, sticky variety, so if that's you, you may not like this one as much as I do. To me, the gooey factor of many browies just comes off as raw. This is a cakier brownie, but still with a denser, more chewy texture than chocolate cake. Made as written (w/o nuts because I didn't have any) and they turned out beautifully. Very chocolatey.

I gave this recipe 4 stars because it is good. But, i did take other responders advise and only use 1c of flour. Also, I cooked them for about 30 min. which was good because if cooked any longer at all they would have been dry. They are definetly quick an deasy when you need a chocolate fix, and I think you could slightly taste the egg in them. Maybe if we only used 3 eggs instead of 4. But, would they turn out still would be the question. Basically they are quick easy and good. thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely wonderful. I cut the flour to 1 cup, using 3/4c Wheat flour & the remaining all purpose. I increased the cocoa by about 1 Tbls, and added 1/2c chocolate chips. These make 24 perfect brownie cupcakes and if you like or don't like nuts, you can add to half of the cupcakes. I only had to bake as cupcakes for about 21 minutes.

They are good, I used only one cup of flour as others suggested to keep them less cake-like. But they still turned out too cakie. Not really a brownie texture. I will make these again, but maybe with one less egg next time.

Yumm-o!  You don't even need baking skills to get this one right!  I used smart balance whipped spread instead of butter (it makes me feel just a wee bit better about the fat) and used 1 1/4 c. of flour.  I love them! PMS therapy to the rescue!

This recipe is one I always use when I don't have much time but want to throw together something tasty for dessert. I love that this only uses one bowl and how simple they are to make! I like serving mine warm with some vanilla ice cream. Everyone in my family just gobbles these up! Thanks!

I think this recipe has too many leavening agents and make it come more like a cakey brownie.  If you like cakey brownies this is the one to keep.

I made these brownies on a double date.  Decided to add about 1 cup of chocolate chips for some extra chocolate goodness and it turned out great.  It wasn't too sweet; the cocoa powder gave it just enough flavor.  The texture was a bit cakey and a bit fudgy, but not too crumbly.  Everyone who tried them said they were different from any brownies they had before, but LOVED them!

Best I have ever made.  I melted the butter, stired in the sugar, stired in the cocoa, stired in the vanilla, and stired in the remaining ing. (sifted together)  Will for sure make again.

I used 1 cup of walnuts, an extra teaspoon of vanilla essence and I baked it in a smaller pan so that they became thicker.  I had to cook it for approx 25 min longer due to the thickness of the brownie, but the outcome was divine.  I topped it with a milk/dark chocolate ganache and sprinkled chopped walnuts on the top.  A generous dollop of vanilla whipped cream topped it off!  Great if you're a nut fan and a definite keeper in my recipe box! My husband LOVES it!

This recipe was great and my guests all raved at the results.  Served w/vanilla ice cream, this recipe will be a repeat!  I made mine with 1 cup of flour and added in 1 cup of shredded coconut and 1/2 cup of chopped pecans, as suggested by another member.  Delicious!

I made mine with 3 eggs and 1 cup of flour. I also added chocolate chips in the middle and on top. They had a delicious gooey, fudgy texture. I brought them to the cottage and they were gobbled up for breakfast! Yum.

I made the recipe exactly as it was written. I was amazed at how simple it was to make. I really wanted a chewy brownie and I didn't get it in this recipe, but I absolutely loved these. My hubby and I cannot stop eating them. If I want a cake like brownie this will definately be my first choice! Thanks for a delicious recipe.

Easy to Make and can be altered to tastes, used 1 cup of flour, added sliced almonds instead of walnuts, making this again adding sliced almonds and mint chocolate chips.

These brownies were really easy and really yummy!! I used 1 1/4 cups of flour and added 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips to the batter and 1/4 cup of mini chocolate chips on top.  They came out very rich and chocolaty ...they were a big hit!

These brownies were very good. Next time I will use less flour like other reviewers suggested, becuase they seemed to cake like. But overall they were very tasty.

I like these just the way they are.  I've made them as written a few times now and they've been appreciated.  This last time I made them I used 1 Cup of white Sugar and 1 Cup of Brown Sugar and it was good too! I grew up using box mixes for brownies and I enjoy this "from scratch" recipe because it is as easy as the box recipes and just as tasty!  Thank you for this one!

I reduced the flour to 1 cup, but they were still too cake-y for my tastes. The flavor was good, just not the texture I was looking for.

Followed the recipe as directed but left out the nuts because I don't like them in brownies.  Came out great!  Baked them in a 9x9 round pan so it took closer to an hour to bake so not so quick but definitely easy.  Personally, I don't subscribe to the dump all ingredients into the bowl and mix method.  I mix dry and wet separately then add the wet to the dry to combine.  You're just much better able to ensure that the ingredients mix evenly.

Not the best brownie I've ever had by a long shot. I decreased the flour to one cup like everyone seemed to suggest, perhaps next time I wouldn't but I don't think there will be a next time for this recipe since there are much better recipes out there.

These brownies tasted delicious. I personally used 1 cup of flour instead of the full amount, and they still were a bit cake-y. I was kind of surprised that it took 4 eggs and a whole cup of butter as I've only made boxed brownies in the past, but I think it was well worth it. This has gone into my recipe box.

A keeper!  I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 C, cut the flour to 1 C, and added about 1/2 C of chocolate chips.  The simplest brownie recipe I've ever made and a nice compromise of cakey/chewy.

I just made these brownies and they turned out beautifully. They taste great. I used 1 c flour and I liked that they were more chewy than cakey. Next time I'm going to add some milk chocolate chips.

Amazing!!! I went ahead and decreased the flour to 1 cup like a lot of people have and instead of walnuts I added peanut butter chips and semi-sweet morsels. These came out so good! They taste absolutely delicious and they're so moist and soft and... well, perfect! I'm definitely going to use this as the base for my brownies from now on. Thanks!

Pretty good brownies.  We also reduced the flour as we like more gooey and less cake.  The only issue I have is the amount of butter required.

I made these in a jelly roll pan so that they would go farther and I might end up with one because I didn't from the last batch.  They are wonderful.  My husband is SO picky about his brownies.  He hates cake brownies and I have now made this recipe 6 times already.  They turn out wonderful even in the jelly roll pan.  I cut back on the baking time and they were wonderful.  I did cut back on the flour to 1 cup total.  They were wonderful!!!!  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!!!!

Grood texture and super moist, but kinda missing something. I followed the other reviewers' suggestion and used a little less flower, and always sprinkle some mini chocolate chips on top after spreding it in the pan. DO NOT USE REAL BUTTER!! Margarine is best for this recipe. For some reason they are better the next day.

These tasted more cake like than brownies. I was hoping it would be more rich. I cut the flour to 1 cup and also cut the butter in 1/2 and added 1/2 cup of applesauce. If I decide to add Choc. chips next time..should I melt them first or just add them to the batter?

This recipe is perfect as is!  I baked them closer to 20 minutes than 30.  Best brownies I have ever had, and brownies are my favorite dessert!  I will never buy a mix again!

In my opinoin they were really not the beat brownies i have ever tasted. I've tasted better! Except, I did use melted chocolate instead of coco powder. the tasted bland! these brownies are so not a keeper. If you really do not want to wast 4 eggs, flour, suger and more I wouldn't recomend wasting your time making these. I wonder if I did something wrong or not? Maybe,I will try it next time!

I made half a batch just now (they are still warm). I reduced the flour to half, added about 30 ml Creme de Menthe. Very easy to make and are yummy! I shall try it with chocolate chips next. Thank you for sharing.

Agree quick to make. Will have to review again later, as this time I biffed. I Added 2 1/2 c. flour (should have known by how thick the batter was), and the outer edges are cakey. Baked for 35 min, and center still undone. I'm hoping that while cooling it'll "stiffen" to the chewy brownies I know & love. Even with that mistake, they are sweet, but don't contain a rich chocolate flavor that I'm craving.

These brownies are awesome! I'll be making these from now on. I'll never go back to a box mix.   I followed some others suggestions and cut the flour down to 1/2 cup, cut the butter down to  1/2 cup, used 3 eggs and omitted the salt. I may also try cutting the sugar down in the future as well because I think they are bit too sweet.

My son (11) made these on his own. Searched out the recipe & made the brownies while spouse and I were at a hockey game.   Since they tasted great, and are easy enough for an 11 year old to make, 5 stars on the quick and easy!

These were great brownies! I took advice and used apple sauce for half of the butter. I also added some cinnamon and cayenne pepper...yummy. My boyfriend loved them. He took some to work with him the next day for his co-workers and they ate them right up!

I was looking for some chewy yummy brownies and this was great. I had to cut it in half and use a 9x9 pan, so I only had 1/2 cup flour based on other reviewers comments. The brownies were thin, chewy on the outside and soft on the inside. Make sure to let them cool just a little bit, if you can help it.

This was a good recipe, but when baking a double batch in two separate pans, it is not quick. I followed the recipe, with my only modification being the addition of mint chips in the batter. The texture is very good, not too cakey at all. My husband loved it!

These are amazing! I just cut the flour down by half a cup following the reviews of others. I've made them twice this week and they don't last more then two days. Our friends even make special trips to come over for a slice. Awesome recipe. Thanks!!

I used only 1 cup flour as recommended.  They were ok, a little on the bland side for me, I like rich, fudgey brownies.  They were good average cake-like brownies.

Very good homemade recipe.  I usually like the mixes better than homemade, but this was good.  Could be more chocolaty for my liking, may try adding some chocolate chips to the batter next time.  I put some Heath toffee bits on top after it baked for about 10-15 minutes since my husband doesn't like plain brownies.  Thanks!

Yummy! This recipe is exactly what I was looking for in a brownie: chewy and rich! I always thought the box brownies were the best until I discovered these. I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and used only 1 c flour. I also used 1 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar. I sprinkled them with powdered sugar after baking (25 minutes was the perfect baking time) and they are fabulous!

This was a huge hit in my house. My family loves brownies so I was skeptical. It turned out great. I cut the butter in half and replaced it with applesauce to make it more low fat friendly. No one noticed the difference! Thanks!

Wonderful.  I just ruined my dinner with these.  I used Hershey's Special Dark Dutch Processed cocoa, purchased in my last town.  Hope I can buy it in my new town because it made these brownies incredibly dark and chocolatey.  I used less flour and more cocoa and added pre-toasted pecans.

I just made these for a bake sale and they are perfect!  I reduced the flour as many suggested (I used 1 1/4 cup) and added chocolate chips.  They cut easily and were the perfect cake-like consistency to make into individual pieces to bag.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover frosting I had made and hubby requested some brownies.  I had never made brownies from scratch before and we were not disappointed!  This is a great recipe!  I left all the ingredients the same and baked for about 28 minutes.  They came out great and I was able to cut them into heart shapes for Valentines Day with no problem.  Can't wait to make these again!

This was so fast, easy and delicious!! Just the right amount of sweetness and chocolate. This recipe is a real keeper. I have made many brownie recipes that we didn't like so today when trying the first time I cooked them in an 8 x 8 square glass pyrex dish and halved all the ingredients. It took 25 mins. to bake. It worked out great. I did cut the flour down to 1 cup (1/2 cup for half recipe) like others suggested to make it less cakey and really liked the texture. I always add extra vanilla to all sweets and did so here ( almost doubled).

They really are quick and easy, but they whould be called quick, easy, and delicious brownies, because they are. Only changes I made were to bake at 325 because I used a glass baking dish, and to add a layer of semisweet chocolate chips right after they came out of the oven, which I spread to make a thin chocolate layer once they melted. Thanks for the great recipe!

We weren't super into these, they tasted alright and everything, but we like thick and chewy brownies better than the fluffy light colored cake like brownies.  They were okay though.

I cut this recipe in half because I didn't need that many brownies. I wanted to use less flour like most of the review suggested and wasn't sure, so I just used 1/2 a cup and a little extra... they are pretty good, should go fast!

Really good...I made the brownies with only 3 eggs and 1 cup flour, and added a cup of semi-sweet baking chips.  Super yummy and sooooo easy!

These brownies are really good for using cocoa powder. I used all the flour, but added a 1/2 bag of Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate chips. I have a convection oven that decreases the temp 25 degrees, so I had to cook the brownies for 40 to 45 minutes (slightly larger glass pan). Give these brownies a try, you will not be disappointed.

Greatest brownies I've ever had. I also used a bit less flour and one less egg and sifted confectioners sugar over them. I'm going to make these all the time!

I only used 1 (rounded) cup of flour per the other reviews and baked in an 11 x 7 pan.  They turned out perfect.  Firm and with a slight "cake" texture, but still soft and gooey.  The best!

I usually can not make browniesn even from a box. Made these on a whim and did not decrease the flour like others suggested and these were fantastic!!!!! I will never buy a box again. So easy to make, I microwaved the butter which saved time I did add chocolate chips as not a nut fan, will decrease the flour to see the difference, but I LOVED this recipe. Thank you thank you thank you!!!

Yum yum! I followed some of the folks advise and used 1 cup of flour and 3 eggs. They came out perfect!  I baked them for 25 minutes and my family gobbled them up.  Definitely a keeper.

These brownies didn't come out "quite right". They tasted pretty good, but something seemed missing. The texture was the same. There were not enough walnuts for my liking. I will not make these again.

Not bad but I had a few issues. I cut the flour to 1 cup because I prefer chewy brownies to caky ones. Mine ended up caky and fell apart too easily. I think maybe the flour, baking powder and salt should be combined before adding to the rest instead of adding them one at a time? Also, it says to bake for 20-30 minutes. Mine required the full 30 minutes.

This is a very good basic brownie recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly...only changing the walnuts to chocolate chips instead.  The brownies were moist and delicious.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5-star, is because to me, a 5-star brownie is thick, chewy, and lined with caramel.

I just love this recipe! Easy to make & absolutely delicious! I recieved nothing but great reviews from my brownie tester. Reducing the flour to a cup did the trick plus I was left with 3/4 cup of cocoa so i top it off with chocolate emulco & i turns out great! could be the reason why my brownie is more fudgy. Thanks for this great recipe!

These are the first homemade brownies I have ever made and they are just as good if not better than the box mixes!  I had to substitute shortening for butter since I was low and I only used 3 eggs so they wouldnt be so cakey and followed the recommendation for only 1 cup of flour. Yummy!

From experience, all the best brownies I have ever made were done in a gas oven. No idea why but they always came out more moist. This was the case for me as I am using electric. I also used plain cocoa and they did not turn out anything like I am used to. I usually use Dutch Processed cocoa which is far superior and darker in texture (and cheaper!). I agree about using less flour as stated by several reviewers.

Like other reviews suggested, I cut out a half up of flour. The result was a delicious fudge-y brownie that didn't last long. These are quintessential brownies, and will hit the spot every time. Everyone in my family is begging me to make more.

Delicious. They were devoured at work. I did do just the 1 cup of flour due to a preference for less cake-like brownies.
{for added decadence try them with dark cocoa....mmmmmmmmm}

I just made these, using just 1 cup of flour as others suggested, and they're ok...I guess I prefer my brownies a bit more chocolatey.  But they're perfectly fine for a quick snack fix.  And they're easy...

Awesome.  We generally make a box of pre-mixed brownies on Sunday afternoon as a treat.  Tried these in the place of the brownie mix.  It was a hit with our four kids and very easy to make!

Very good brownie. Easy prep too. The brownie did need 45 minutes of total oven time, at 30 minutes my toothpick was still completely wet. It also fell in the center and cracked pretty bad. BUT I planned on frosting the brownies so I didn't care too much how it looked. The brownie really does taste great, with 45 minutes of cook time in a 9x13 pan, they are still slightly gooey but definitely done. Will make these again.

I just made these (they're in the oven now) but I know they'll come out great! I did taste the batter, as I always do, and it tasted just like my favorite mix! I have never found a good recipe for brownies before, but I think I have now!

Super good, super rich, super easy.  The only problem is that the cooking time was almost double.  At 25 minutes they were still straight liquid in the center.

I followed most of the other reviewers advice and I used 3/4 cocoa and 1 cup flour. They turned out so fudgey and perfect. I also did a broiled peanut butter topping. 
#  1/3 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
# 3/4 cup crunchy peanut butter
# 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
# 2 tablespoons milk
mixed together, spread on pre-baked brownies, and broil till turns golden.
Yum!

I love this recipe!! It was quick and easy and the brownies are great.  I did take other reviewers advice and only used 1 cup of flour.  Mine took a little longer than a half hour to bake, but well worth the wait!!

I used vegetable oil in place of the butter and dark chocolate cocoa instead of regular cocoa and left out the nuts.  Then topped with powder sugar.  They looked great and were delicious!  Very easy to make and very chewy.

I love Cakey Brownies, I will keep this recipe. I think that I would cut down on the sugar maybe 1 1/2 cup and would had cup of chocolate morsels. I personally felt it tasted very sweet, husband and children loved it overall I also loved it. will keep this recipe.

Quick...and easy, yup. Tasteless and bland? yep. I too, used just one cup of flour, still too cakey for my taste...brownies = fudgey somewhat gooey in my book. Won't make again, just not our cup of tea.

These were wonderful! I took the suggestions made by others and increased the chocolate to 3/4 c. and decreased the flour to just a smidge over 1 c. They weren't too fudgy nor too cakey. Perfect! I didn't bother putting in the nuts or icing on them. They didn't need it! 
I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the changes I made.

I was looking for an easy brownie recipe so my 2 year old daughter could help me bake them.  I made them exactly as written.  We ate them warm out of the oven and I was a little disappointed - they seemed cakey.  Hours later, when they cooled, they were FABULOUS.  Rich, moist, and chocolatey.  I don't like a lot of hooplah in my brownies - no chocolate chips or icing, so this is perfect for me.  Thanks!

Instead of using just coca powder, I also used instant coffee to get some flavor in there.

My brother and husband thought these were great! I thought they were a bit too sweet, but I like dark chocolate more than sweet. I used 1c flour like others and upped the cocoa powder to about 3/4c. Ended up using a 10x7 pan because I couldn't find an 8x8. Baked for about 40 minutes and they were dense and moist and fudgy!

I've made these twice now- they are a hit in our family!  In fact, for our 10 year old's birthday treat, he requested these brownies instead of cake.  We warm them and serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream- YUM!

These brownies were incredibly easy to bake and were very tasty. I was going to a friend's house for dinner and needed to bring a dessert. I did not decide to make these until a little over an hour before we needed to leave. The whole process was done in time for us to go by the store and pick up some vanilla ice cream.

The brownies were a hit and my friend was eating the leftovers for the next week! I will be making these again.

I loved this!!! Quick and Easy is the perfect title.  My 2 year old and I made these in a snap and they turned out terrific!  I omitted the nuts and added chocolate chips instead.  Other than that we followed the directions exactly.  Nice and cakey, great with vanilla ice cream!  This will be my standard brownie recipe from now on!

I made these twice.  The first time, the brownies were bland, not chocolatey enough.  The second time I added Chocolate syrup  to the recipe and mini chocolate chips... a little over kill.   The next time, I will only use the chocolate syrup.

Very good!!!  And extremely EASY.  However, they did seem to get quite hard and crunchy after they cooled.  I prefer a soft and chewy brownie.  But I won't stop making them!!  Very very good!!

I've made these twice now, once w/less flour like other reviewers suggested and once to a "t".  Both are yummy!  Everyone has said these are the best brownies they've ever had.  First time made them with choc chips, which made them even more chocolatey/fudgy!  Probably my favorite, but the more flour one is very good too!

5 Stars for Taste!!!  I have to admit, I was a little nervous about mixing raw eggs into hot melted butter, so I let the melted butter cool a bit before adding the rest of the ingredients.  Super easy to mix up and they have a rich chocolate flavor.  Mine were a little hard to get out of the pan, so next time (and yes there will certainly be a next time) I'll grease and flour the pan and see if that makes a difference.

These are quick and easy, but a bit light on chocolate for my taste.  I followed the recipe exactly (maybe a little bit less flour) and mine turned out a light brown and taste only slightly of chocolate.  I will make these again, since the recipe is so simple, but next time I will use more cocoa powder and probably some brewed coffee for extra flavor.  I do like that all the ingredients are things I typically have on hand.  Once it's tweaked, this will be great for baking whenever the mood hits!

These didn't last long!  I made these with 1 1/4 c flour and 3 eggs as previously suggested.  I also added some cinnamon and left out the nuts (I forgot them!)  I did have to cook them for about 15 minutes longer but they were very tasty.  I'm making them again tonight!

These were great.  Super simple to make.  I used Dark Chocolate cocoa powder, and put in 1/2 cup chopped pecans instead of walnuts, as well as 1/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips.  I warmed some apple dipping caramel in the microwave and piped it over the top from a corner-cut ziploc bag, then swirled with a knife before baking. Warning, I had to bake them 35+ minutes until a toothpick came out clean from the center, but ooh, they were fantastically yummy!

I made this as written.  They were good but needed extra time to bake - they were still gooey after 30 minutes.  I like that the recipe calls for things that are always in my pantry!  I sprinkled some chocolate chips on top because I had some - yum!  A good, basic recipe that is easy to make.

I really liked these! I didn't have butter or margarine so used vegetable oil and they still were delicious, I'm sure they'd be FABULOUS with butter. I'll be making these often. I made 1/2 in a 8" pan, cooked for about 27 minutes and came out perfect. I think some coolwhip, frosting or icecream on top would work good too. Thanks for an easy delicious recipe!

This was a great recipe but i'd reccomend to keep it in the oven for another 10 mins as i found it very liquidy after the set time. 
Wonderful. Will use this recipe again.

I don't know what happened. These did not turn out for me. The proportions are all wrong. Way too much sugar in here. My husband and I shared just one, but we did not care for it. I will definitely be searching for a different one. Sorry.

No more box brownies at my house! I made these brownies exactly as instructed. However, after they cooled I added a cocoa icing made of confectioner's sugar, cocoa, butter, milk, and some other stuff. They were excellent. My husband called them "the devil" because he couldn't eat just one. Thanks for the recipe!~

I like homemade brownies and I'm always looking for new recipes. This one reminds me of my family's old recipe. I used the variatin that called for less flour, added chocolate chips, and caramel. They were pretty good!

This is a super easy recipe. Added 1/2 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of walnuts. Very yummy. Next time around I would probably cut down on the sugar just a tad.

These brownies were very easy to make and tasted yummy.  I reduced the flour to 1 cup and used three eggs.  I also added butterscotch chips for richer flavor.

this was so yummy! I used a 9x9 pan per another review, next time I will use 13x9. Line your pan w/ foil, so much easier to get out of the pan. These were delicious. I only used 1 cup of flour, and added chocolate chips.

These were really good.  I only used 1 cup of flour because I don't like my brownies too cakey.  Super fast and easy (I think I had it in the oven in under 10 minutes).I love this recipe because it uses cocoa instead of baker's chocolate.  That's why I'll use it over and over again. We all have cocoa sitting in our cupboards but who has a ready supply of baker's chocolate?

I really enjoyed these.  My only substitutions were to add 1/2 cup of salted cashews (the salty nuts help balance the sweetness) instead of the walnuts.  And, be sure not to overbake these...

If you like fudgy type brownies, be sure to drop them on the floor as soon as you take them out of the oven (from about 8 inches)!

This is an easy recipe for myself and my 2 1/2 year old son to make. I have made them twice without nuts, following the directions and have never had problems. They are more cake-like and we don't mind that.

Had to make this after not having everything for another recipe but this came out so great!!! I've already given away everything from the first batch and working on my second. 
On a personal note I will be added butterscotch chips to the second batch for a different twist.

very very good!!!  I used 1 cup of flour only and 1 cup chocolate chips mixed into batter.  Had to bake about 10 mins. longer that stated.  Used a glass 9 x 13 dish.  Everyone loved them, and so easy!!!!
Thanks, Michele, Cambridge Ontario

These brownies tasted awesome!  I used 1 cup of flour like other reviewers but that was the only change I made.  I did have a hard time getting them out of the pan, they weren't crumbly and dry, but for some reason they wouldn't come out.  We ate them anyway, they were very moist!

This is a delicious recipe.  I used 1 cup of flour for denser brownies and added 1 cup of chocolate chips as someone else suggested.  Very easy to make. I love the recipe calls for cocoa powder since I usually have that on hand.

These brownies were tastless and waaayy too cakey. probably because i used egg substitute and becasue i beat them too long. It tasted like a half vanilla, half chocolate cake with too little suger.

The brownies were delicious and easy.  I also added to the recipe two family size cookie and cream chocolate bars (broken apart in multi-size pieces).  I brought them to work and they were gone before lunch.

I just made these and they turned out wonderful! I did take others advice and use only 1 cup of flour because I like dense brownies. I baked for 25 minutes. They were very easy to cut also.

I didn't have any brownie mix so I decided to see how hard it would be to make them homemade since I have never made them before. I cam across this recipe and read the reviews and decided it was very easy. I poured some of my batter into a smaller cake pan and the rest into a mini muffin pan. The mini muffins only took 10 mins. and the pan took 18 mins. and they were delicious. My whole family loved them and I made the recipe just as it is. They had a great flavor and texture.I will continue making these for our family.

Made this for the second time tonight and they came out great (again)!  Unless you really overbake them, I don't know how they could come out "dry".  Love the fact that this makes a big pan (DH goes through them like crazy)and the fact that they don't need icing (just a little powdered sugar sprinkled on top while they are still warm).  Thanks for a great recipe!

You named these perfectly, because the brownies WERE quick and easy to make.  I'm 25, a mother of 2, a chocoholic and brand new to this homemade cooking thing!!!  I felt like I owed it to my kids to make special treats for them from scratch.  It was time I learned, and this recipe was the perfect start.  For basic brownines, these came out just as good as the store bought mix.  I added a little vanilla extract and crushed m&m's for fun, but otherwise, followed the recipe.  I love how chewy they are, not dried out, not burnt, yet they held their shape nicely.  They didn't fall apart, so need for plates.  Just let them cool, cut in squares and eat out of the pan!!!  (Yes, they were that good  =) )  Thanks so much for helping to make my 1st "from scratch" project go so smoothly.  I would like to find a recipe that makes them come out more fudgy, but again, this is the perfect basic brownie recipe.

The taste is good, and they are quick and easy, but they have more of a texture of cake than a chewy brownie.

these were ok, but mine came out dry and not nearly as flavorful as brownies made with the recipe that comes on the box of unsweetened baking chocolate.

I haven't made homemade brownies in a long time and i was suprised at how "quick and easy" these really are!! I did have to bake them longer than the recipe stated though. ( 50 minutes ) But that could have been because of my adding 1 cup of choclate chips instead of the nuts. Thanks for this recipe!! I'll use it again!

Yummy! My family of four devoured half the pan warm out of the oven. I didn't have nuts so I added chocolate chips instead. When it came out of the oven I put more chocolate chips on top, and spread it over the top when melted.
