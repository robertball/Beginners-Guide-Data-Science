I really enjoyed making these, the recipe was different & I learned some new techniques. 
The cookies are excellent & I will add this to my favorites. 
I made them at 7000 foot elevation so made a few changes for the high altitude: I added 3 Tbls flour, 3 Tbls water, and cooked them at 25 degree hotter oven.
