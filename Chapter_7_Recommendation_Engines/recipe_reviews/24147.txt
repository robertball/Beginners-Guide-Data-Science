Yum! I made this french toast for a brunch today and it was a big hit. Slicing and filling the toast seemed frighteningly gourmet to me, but it was easy. I used blueberry pie filling instead of preserves. Kudos!

This was okay. If I were to do this again I would use either jam or syrup and not both. Too sweet.

Five stars for most of the ingredients. Three stars for the method. I made this as directed only changing the preserves to my homemade strawberry preserves. We tried it with and without the syrup and we much preferred it without the syrup because it was too sweet. I have made quite a few stuffed french toast recipes and they usually stuff before cooking. I think that would have made this easier and way more appealing. Neither of us were thrilled with the cold mascarpone and preserves in the center of the hot bread. Because I love all these ingredients, I will try this again. Next time I will cut the pockets in the bread. Pan fry as directed. Stuff the mascarpone and preserves. Bake as directed. Will check back in here if that is a better method. Thanks for sharing.

Delish! A little bit messy trying to stuff the french toast right before serving when we were rushing around.  But they were a huge hit.  Beautiful and delicious for brunch.
