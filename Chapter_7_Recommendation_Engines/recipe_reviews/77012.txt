Great twist on chicken soup! I didn't use the base as suggested, only chicken bouillon because I didn't have time to make the base.  I only used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of whole kernal corn since that's all I had on hand. I added a can of green chilis, 1/2 sauteed onion, garlic powder and red pepper flakes.  I omitted the jalapeno pepper, cilantro, chips, cheese and lime wedges.  The heat from the spices and broth really felt great on my throat!  I'll keep the ingredients on hand for the next time I feel under the weather!

Wow!  As I was making this I stole a few tastes and was wondering whether or not it would taste great when it was finished.  As soon as I served it to all my family members, they couldn't stop raving about how amazing this soup was.  I have to agree.  I loved the Southwestern Flair; it reminded me of home.  I follwed this recipe to a tee and will do so again and again.  I can see why this recipe was featured in USA Today.  It'd be a great idea if you need something to make for LOTS of people, since it is a HUGE amount of soup.  Even with four of us eating, there was enough left over for all of us for DAYS.  And it's just as good reheated.

I didn't use  Pam's soup base recipe...I just used frozen, thawed rotissirie chicken (I always buy one when I grocery shop, use part of it in a recipe & then freeze half ...when in a time crunch, it beats out canned chicken anyday ;o)  ) & low sodium broth. I did saute onions, celery & red bell pepper in EVOO  to soften for a few minutes (I also sauteed the cumin & chile powder for a minute or two to help draw out their flavor) before adding the broth & chicken so I think it was pretty comparable to Pam's soup base. From that point, I followed the recipe except I omitted the cheese & garnished w/ a tbp of low-fat sour cream & a lime slice. Love your recipes Pam!

The original recipe was a good start, but this is a lot healthier.  I received big complements on this very hearty soup and even though it was made at the last minute, it was still delicious!  I cook without wheat, avoid added salt,  love spicy food (but have a wimpy husband), and except for chicken broth, I cook without meat.

Sauté 1 chopped onion and when it starts to brown add 2 stalks of chopped celery, cooking until tender. 

On low heat, I added only one tablespoon cumin and one teaspoon chili powder (feared it would be too much in the original recipe).  I have fresh lemon thyme, so I stirred in a bit of that in also. 

After the spices are warmed a bit, increase heat and add about 3-4 cups of water and 3-4 packets of sodium free (and gluten free) chicken broth (Herb-ox).  Add tomatoes and corn (I didn't have any jalapeño) and cook for a few minutes.  My husband walked by and suggested adding leftover rice to it to get it out of the fridge (it was a good idea). 

I then added the rinsed beans at the end (so not to overcook already soft canned beans) and stirred in a little fresh cilantro and ground pepper before serving. 

My meat eater added chopped ham to his serving.  Sprinkle each serving with low-fat Mexican cheese and top with a dollop of fat-free yogurt (or sour cream).  Someone was in the baked corn chips, so I was only able to determine they would have been a very good addition.

This is the best soup ever!  I first made it when I was looking for a soup with a 'restaurant quality' soup base.  This is definitly the answer!  The broth is rich and full of flavor.  The soup is great when made as indicated - don't change a thing!

I make this soup frequently.  It is my absolute favorite.  Instead of the base, I just boil a chicken breast with all the ingredients and chop it, put it back into the soup and eat!

This was great!  Rather than make the stock I used 99% FF Chicken broth and chopped up a couple chicken breasts I already had cooked.  I halved the recipe since it's just me eating it.  I'll take it for lunch tomorrow.

As with most recipes, I add whatever I have on hand. This time, leftover chicken, cilantro. This is a great light dinner with just enough kick.

Great base. And I added some chipotle peppers with the sauce to kick up the flavor even more.

I used lime juice instead and less ground cumin. My 2 year-old even ate it.  Took no time to make.

We loved this!  Even my picky kids liked it in spite of the fact that it was made with vegis.  I adjusted to include what I had.  I have made it with some rice and/or potatoes to make it a bit more filling.  I have made it with and without chunks of chicken, but always with the chicken broth.  It's fabulous served with sour cream, cilantro, chopped chives and a squeeze of lime on top.  This is pretty quick and a good stick to your ribs meal in one pot that is even better accompanied with some fresh bread.  We are having it with a sourdough boule that is rising in the oven now.  
This is definitely recommended.

Excellent!  Only change was substituted green chiles for the jalapeno.  My kids loved it...and it makes a huge batch, so plenty for the freezer.

This is an easy & flavorful soup.  I skipped the oil & celery in the Fast Chicken Soup Base and used less cumin, but followed the rest of the recipe as written.

I, like many other reviewers, did not use the soup base.  I had left over yellow rice and some black beans from mexican night earlier this week so this soup worked out GREAT for leftovers. Had dinner on the table in 10mins.  I took the comments from Celiac2003 and modified this recipe a bit.  I sauted chopped celery and some diced carrott (laying around my fridge). I added cumin and chili powder and chicken stock. Bring to a boil.   Added fresh tomato salsa (the pico de gallo one, I didn't have any canned tomatoes on hand), corn, black beans, and cooked rice. Heat till warmed.   Stirred in a little fresh cilantro, ground pepper, and hot sauce.  Topped with leftover mexican cheese blend, a dolop of sourcream, and fresh cubed avacado. Served with some tortilla chips.  EXCELLENT. FAST, EASY, HEALTHY dinner.

Great soup! When I make for my family, it's made as written. When I make it for myself, I use veggie broth and leave out the chicken. A really great soup either way.

This was really good, but I made quite a few changes: I used 1/2 the liquid, used canned corn instead, and added cooked chicken torn in bits. Skipped the cilantro & lime.

Pretty good...I didn't use the "Fast Chicken Soup Base," rather I used chicken broth. I added some bell peppers and diced green chilis I had on hand, but I'd want to play with the seasonings a bit. Good soup, but no real "wow" factor.

Nom! This was delicious! The only things I did differently were 1) I used my own chicken stock (and chicken) that I already had on hand instead of the chicken soup base, 2) I didn't use a jalapeno, because I didn't have one, and 3) I didn't use cilantro, because I'm one of the people who thinks it tastes like soap :) The soup was fantastic - filling and rich - and I'm sure it would be better with the kick that a jalapeno would give it. I'll totally make it again.

I used the Swanson brand large can of chicken broth, a small can of diced green chili peppers in place of the jalapenos and cut up a medium sized bag of defrosted frozen chicken breasts and it was to die for! Super fast and easy. Makes for a delicious dinner or lunch! Will make this again and again!

VERY yummy.  Easy to create your own version.  We leave the jalapenos off and then add them to make our own heat

Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. I added cooked onion and 2 cloves of garlic. I used instant chicken broth. Used only 1 can beans. Did not have the chili pepper, but did add regular hot sauce. I used a half of lime's juice to give it a nice twang. Came out so yummy! Will make again! (we also added crushed tortilla chips to the soup! YUMMMM!)

This soup was so easy to make. I put all of the ingredients in the crock pot on low for about 6 hours.  The flavor was so good I did't have to add salt or pepper.  My daughter is a picky eater and she loved it too!

We did not love this recipe.  We eat lots of Mexican food and love spicy food, but this was really not as good as I expected it to be.  Won't make this one again.

Wonderful soup. The only chicken in the house was sliced deli meat,so I sliced up about 5 oz of it and used it in the stock recipe. No carcass available, so I skipped that part. Also used 8 chicken bullion cubes instead of chicken broth. I pretty much just put all the ingredients in the pot for the stock and the soup at once and simmered for a while. Served with tortilla chips and Monteray Jack cheese (didn't have a lime). Fabulous. This makes a LOT of soup...I'd say way more than the stated 8 servings. But hey, I love frozen leftovers for another day...:)

Unbelievably good! If donr just right you can save and use the left over broth to make chicken noodle soup. Just add 1 lg can of chicken broth to what is left along with 3 pounds of cut-up chicken tenders, 2-3 carrots peeled and cut and a little more celery along with 2 bags of noodles (your choice) and you then have another delicious meal from just one day of work.

We love this recipe. We always add cubed chicken and serve with tortilla chips, sour cream and cheese.

This was so tasty and easy!  I used 4 cups of water and boulion instead of the soup base, put the jalepeno in the blender with the tomatoes instead of chopping by hand, and added pre-cooked chicken breast.  My husband & I ate the entire pot!  I will be making this again.

Awesome, healthy, low-fat and absolutely delicious.  I love Pam Anderson's recipes, every one I have tried is spectacular!  I served these with corn bread muffins.  Yummy!

This soup is amazing! I love it! I'm a big fan of cilantro. Trying to add more beans to my diet. Such a healthy combination of ingredients and so flavorful! I do add some cooked quinoa when I add the cilantro at the end to make it a bit heartier. Tastes even better reheated the following day. I've been making this about once a week for the past month.

wonderful. I used a Serrano pepper instead of a jalapeño. Cannot wait until I have a lime in the house to serve with this.

Made this for the first time today.  I halved the recipe and it turned out very good.  It was simple and great for a cold night.  I'll be making it again.

Super delish I did add some baked herbed chicken thighs and cut it up and added to the last simmer phase. I also added two additional cans of black beans because I knew we would want leftovers. Super fab. Highly recommend

Didn't really impress us too much. Love black beans, and the southwestern flair, but there just wasn't enough substance for me. I like my soup thicker, and this is totally lacking in that department, even with two cans of beans. If I made it again, I would cut down on the broth, and maybe purée some beans into it to give it more thickness. (That would mean one more can of beans, though, because I wouldn't sacrifice the number of beans in the soup).

I used my own chicken stock, halved the cumin added sliced avocado.  Also used one can beans and fresh corn off the cob. The lime and cilantro really make the dish even though I'm not a huge fan of cilantro. Guess I will have to reevaluate that. Great soup. Will make it again.

This recipe sounds really good; I love corn and black beans together. It's one of my favorite food combos. Too bad this recipe has too much sodium, but then, so do most soup/stew recipes. I love soups and stews, but not the sodium.
