This recipe has a very sticky consistancy even after refridgerating it was more like a drop cookie consistancy. The flavor of the dough was great however this should not be called a cut-out cookie recipe unless you plan on adding alot more flour than is called for in the recipe.

I didn't have any oranges to zest so instead I used 2 Tbsp orange marmalade and I only had pecans so I ground them up with sugar and a bit of cinnamon and put that on top and they were incredible. The sour cream makes them super moist but the other reviewer was right this is a drop cookie rather than a cut out because the batter is really sticky. I thought it was a great tasting treat though thumbs up!

This is almost identical to the recipe my mom used when I was little so now Chritmas cookies without a hint of orange flavor just don t taste quite right to me. These cookies are great and always a hit with my friends & family!
