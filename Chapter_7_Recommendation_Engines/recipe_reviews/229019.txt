Loved it....I used hot Italian chicken sausage out of the casing and crumbled and I also used extra lean ground chicken instead of the turkey cutlets. I use low sodium fat free chicken broth andded some chopped red peppers and a zucchini diced for more veggies. Very nice served with low fat sour cream and shredded cheddar with tortilla chips for dipping...thanks!

This was a great recipe, but I did substitute lean ground turkey for the cutlets.  I added a few red peppers since I had them on hand, and boy was this good!

This was surprisingly good!  I was nervous about the large amount of cumin (and we love cumin) and garlic powder; but, the spices were not overpowering.  I skipped the chopped jalapeños; but, I did add the whole jalapeños.  I was curious about how that method would work.  It adds a subtle layer of heat without having to chop the peppers.  I also used hot Italian chicken sausage and lean ground turkey for the meat.  I suggest browning the onions first in 1/2 tbs olive oil then use the other 1/2 tbs olive oil to cook the turkey separately.  After browning the onions and turkey I put everything in the crock pot on high for 4 hours.  Next time I might add a chopped tomato to the pot and then a bit of fresh parsley or cilantro in the final minutes if cooking.  Top with some sour cream and cheddar cheese and serve with a hearty slice of rustic bread and a green salad for a complete meal.

I enjoyed this very much.  It wasn't "chili" in the sense that most Texans think of red bean-type chili, but the flavor was very good.  My husband suggested cooking the sausage out of the casing (as one reviewer had done) so it spreads a bit across each bite and, for us, adding carrots and perhaps another vegetable.  I really liked the concept of adding in the whole jalapeno peppers during cooking. I'll use that idea in other stews/soups in the future!

Loved it!  Seasonings are perfect and not overpowering at all.  Making a second batch now.  Yum!  I did use Chicken Italian Sausage but other than that, kept everything the same.

This is a fantastic recipe!  A perfect use for Thanksgiving turkey leftovers.  We used regular crumbled sausage.  We threw all the ingredients into the crock pot and let it simmer all day.  Fabulous!

This was excellent. I often keep leftover chicken and turkey in the freezer from previous baking. I used that and some andouille sausage. And the leftovers were great too. A little cornbread on the side and we were in heaven.

Wow!!!  I think I may like this better than my red chili.  Only changes were I removed the sausage cases and browned (didn't fully cook) on the stove before cutting into pieces for the chili (instead of cooking in the oven).  Also, added one 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with basil, garlic, and oregano.  Used 2 jalapenos (not the other 2 that were optional).  Simmered on stove for probably 4 hours.  A little cheese, a little sour cream.  
Was amazing!!!

I made this in the crockpot and it turned out delicious!  The only sub I made was sweet Italian sausage and ground turkey.  I omitted the jalapeño but I did use a can of rotel with mild chilies.  I used fresh garlic instead of powdered.  I will definitely make this again.

I used this chili as a base for my work chili cook off and I won.  I changed quite a few things but this is a great recipe.  I used ground Neese's Sausage instead of a link.  I used one red onion.  I added cilantro,  a good amount of red pepper flakes, chili powder and a dab of saracha, I needed a little more spice.  I used a chili pepper in place of one of the jalapeno peppers.  Everyone really loved it.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for the first time; including using the 2 whole jalapenos. It was terrific but, the second time we made it, we used a large white onion, drained but did not rinse the beans, minced 8 large garlic cloves, diced two large boneless chicken breasts and added a can of fire roasted tomatoes and some basil.... WOW! It was 5 star to begin with but DOUBLE  the rating for the amended recipe. Thank you so much for a recipe that we will make on a weekly basis. Everybody loved it including some very picky little ones. Thanks again!

We loved it.  I thought it may not have enough flavor because turkey can be so bland, but the cumin and garlic powder gave it just the right taste.   I also added ground turkey to the recipe, as well.  Great recipe!

I used smoked chicken, added a can of diced tomatoes and green chillies and played around with the amount of beans and the broth.  To be fair I didn't have any turkey and I like it thicker than soup.  I make this every month and it's gone in 2 days.
