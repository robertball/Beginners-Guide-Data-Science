I found this recipe right before my friend's "friendsgiving dinner" last week. It was cheap and simple to make. It was a huge hit that night and I'm hoping I get the same reactions from my family tomorrow night!

I made this a little differently by not adding ice-cream in the pumpkin mixture because I wanted the deeper color. Nice dessert.

This was AWESOME!!! I've made it twice now.  The first time I followed the recipe because I believe in following a recipe before making revisions. 

The second time I made it I used Ginger Snap cookies instead of Graham Crackers and used pumpkin ice cream from a local dairy farm instead of vanilla.  Since I thougth it might be over powering in flavor (due to the pumpkin ice cream) I omitted nutmeg and cloves. This was WONDERFUL!!! A taste sensation!

Very good!  I didn't do the whipped topping listed here (just did Cool Whip) and it was very good!  Like pumpkin pie ice cream cake, basically!

This pretty much just amounts to pumpkin flavored ice cream pie with whipped cream on top. I used a  Keebler 9" graham cracker crust  instead of making my own crust in a 9" x  9" square pan like the recipe calls for. It was a nice change from regular pumpkin pie.

Tasted good,  like pumpkin ice cream.  However, I made it one day in advance and the mixture crystallized; tasted like it had ice crystals in it. Kind of like ice cream that melts and refreezes. Maybe tastes better when you only freeze the recommended amount of time.
