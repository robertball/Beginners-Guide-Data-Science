These are wonderful! They were zesty, fuity with a wonderful texture. I only made two small changes: As another reviewer, I only used 1 cup of chopped cranberries which we found to be plenty! Also, I never had any almond extract so I decided to add 1/4 cup of toasted crushed almond slices. I am not a hugh fan of almond extact but using the real toasted almonds was amazing and really made a difference. Since it said to divide the dough into two logs I decided to add the almonds (1/8 cup for half the recipe) to one log and omit them in the other to test the difference. The cookies without the almonds tasted more fruity...you could really taste the orange and cranberry. The almonds added a more comlex and interesting flavor where all the flavors came through and none were overpowering. We liked both but the cookies with the almonds were our favorite! To toast the almonds: spread sliced almonds on a baking sheet and bake in a 375 deg oven for 3-5min until they look lightly browned. Let cool and crush.

This cookie is wonderful. I did not change a thing. It makes a perfectly tender shortbread. The citrus and cranberries take it to another level. These will be on my Christmas cookie trays during the holidays because they are such a beautiful and simple cookie. Thanks for sharing this gem :) BTW will be trying this with lemon or lime zest and dried blueberries too.

This recipe is a keeper.  Made just the way it was told to make with the following exceptions:  I used 2 tsp. of almond extract and 1/2 tsp of vanilla (just did the reverse of what the recipe called for) because I LOVE almond extract flavoring.  The cookies turned out great, and I only chilled them for 2 hours, instead of 4.  Good luck.  They turned out great in appearance and taste great.

They were tasty, but we thought they lacked something. I ended up making them with lemon peel. After eating a few and thinking them a bit blah, I made a glaze with icing sugar and lemon juice to top them. Then they were amazing! I will bemaking them for Christmas for sure. Very colourful on a plate of sweets.

My cookies looked exactly like the picture!! I changed one thing only and that was the amount of cranberries. I reduced them to one cup.
I have a tip that might be useful when using cranberries. You know how they come out of the  bag all clumped up? I put them in a bowl and sprinkle flour over the top, in this case using about 3 tablespoons, then, using my hands, I distribute the flour so it coats the cranberries and that helps to separate those clumps. It's so much easier chopping cranberries when they're un-clumped.
Edited to add: my son's fianc√© liked these so much, she asked me to make some for their wedding.

I am getting ready to make these for a second time.  I just love these.  Tender, soft and yummy.  I did add a little more orange zest then called for, I think.  I just zested a whole orange.  I am getting ready to make these with blueberry and lemon.  I think that will be tasty!!

I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because of a few tweaks that needed to be made. Like most reviewers, I only used 1 cup of chopped cranberry and that was almost too much, I can't imagine using 2 cups. Baking them 10 mins would have burnt them to a crisp; I baked 8 mins and they turned out perfect. I also added more orange zest then the 1 tbsp the recipe called for.

I did modify this recipe based on suggestions from other people. I halved the cranberries (can't imagine how you would cut the darn things if you used what was actually called for). I also doubled the orange zest. It was the perfect amount of orange so I feel like had I used less, you wouldn't really be able to taste it. I cut my cookies in 1/4" slices. Was it supposed to say 1/2"? That sounds like a super fat cookie. Mine stayed in the fridge overnight and were very easy to cut the next day. Took a few minutes longer to bake, maybe 14 min.  I halved the whole recipe and the way I happened to roll and cut I got 24 nice little cookies. I may decrease the almond next time. Just not a personal fan. They otherwise look great, like confetti. Easy to make.

I made these yesterday and baked them today. This recipe is so easy and the cookies are just like you want shortbread to be. They are not too sweet and they just melt in your mouth. I love the added orange zest it adds a perfect balance with the cranberries. Thanks for sharing I am going to make another batch for the freezer. :)

I actually made these cookies twice over the holidays. The first time I made a 1/2 batch just to see how they tasted. They were good, but I did end up making some adjustments. I took out the almond extract and just used vanilla. I also used only 1/3 of the recommended amount of of cranberries and added about 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips (I felt they added a wonderful sweetness that my first batch lacked).

Didn't use almond extract, just extra vanilla (husband doesn't like.). I liked these, however the DH did not. So...I won't be making these again.

Absolutely delicious!  I added orange extract along with the almond extract, and I'm glad I did, but I'm sure they'd taste just as good without it.  I put these in the freezer before slicing, but I still had trouble slicing.  That, however, is not the problem of the recipe.  They come out beautiful (once I squished them together) and they take a tad longer than directed--13-14 mins, probably bc mine were colder from being in the freezer.  Thanks for the recipe!

What a great cookie this makes! I made just a couple of changes: I only added 1 tsp of vanilla and no almond extract, and I added 1C of cranberries instead of 2. I thought the cookie had a nice amount of cranberries, and the hint of vanilla complemented the orange zest well.

Love these cookies. I get soooo many compliments on them. Changes I made were to add sliced almonds, lightly toasted and not add the orange zest to the mix. When I form into logs, I make it a long square shaped tube so when you slice them you have square cookies. That stands out on a cookie platters with all round cookies!

I made it with pecan and prunes instead of cranberries. It turned out very tasty. Love the texture of this shortbread. And it was not too sweet.

I have made this recipe twice this week. Here is my possible explanation for why some feel the cookies are too dry or crumbly. I used the hint a reviewer suggested & stirred 3 T. of flour in the dried cranberries before chopping to keep them from clinging together. That worked beautifully. With the first batch, I remembered to subtract that amount of flour from the 2 c. the recipe calls for in the batter. The 2nd time I forgot. The 2nd batch turned out crumbly and didn't taste quite as good. That additional amount of flour made a noticeable difference in the texture of these delicious cookies. Oh, I used extra orange zest also--a whole orange worth, and cut back to 1 1/4 c. of dried cranberries.

I'm really happy I tried this recipe.  It now has a home in my Christmas "to make" bundle.    These are a very pretty cookie --  it's so nice not having to decorate it.  :0)     I also took the advice of the other reviewers and only used 1 cup of dried fruit.  It was *plenty*.  Thanks, Donna!

These are fabulous.  I made them last year and loved them.  This year I made a double batch of this flavor, and one without the almond flavor.   I also made another batch of cherry almond.  I had gotten a bag of cherry craisans by mistake and decided this was the perfect recipe for them.  I was right.  Use 1 teaspoon of almond flavoring and 2 tsp. of vanilla.  I left out the zest. These are best if baked on parchment paper.   Thank you so much for this recipe.

What a wonderful aroma, from the oven, while these cookies were baking.  I made the cookies according to the recipes except that I used unsweetened dried cranberries and only used about 1 1/2 cups.  That was plenty of cranberries.  After the cookies cooled, I made a thick glaze of powdered sugar, orange juice and grated orange peel to spread on top.  Very attractive and festive for the holiday season.  I will make these again.

Decent cookie. I did not have the dry crumbly problem like some of the other reviews, to avoid, I just tossed my butter and powdered sugar in the stand mixer and really let it whip together smooth. Afterwards, the other ingredients folded together so easily. Shaped into logs with no trouble, refrigerated overnight. I would say that the cookie is on the bland side. It's a good basic recipe, but needs more zest for pep. It is also a mildly sweet cookie. Probably wouldn't be a winner with kids. I rolled the edges of mine in some Wilton's candy coating that I had left over from some other baking, just to provide some extra sweetness and dress them up a bit.

These are so tasty and look pretty on a cookie tray too.  I like that you can vary the dried fruit and you can add pistachios, walnuts, whatever you can imagine.  They keep quite a while when stored properly.

Delicious!  I cut back the cranberry to one cup and added chopped pistachios. The red and green were pretty for Christmas.  Great recipe.

I love shortbread cookies so I was excited about trying these.  I was not disappointed.  I did make a couple slight changes based on reviews.  I only used 1 cup of cranberries.  I chopped the cranberries and sprinkled a little flour on them to prevent clumping.  I used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract.  Other than that I followed the directions and the cookies were absolutely perfect.

Love this recipe.  Couldn't be easier, they came out beautiful.  Based on other reviews I used less cranberries, and chopped them up a bit before adding, also used orange extract as I had no almond extract.    Wrapped them in parchment paper because it makes it easier to roll out into logs than plastic wrap or waxed paper since the dough is not stiff.  Next time I will roll out to thinner logs before refrigerating to get smaller cookies.  This recipe is a keeper.  I am already planning variations on it.

This recipe is good and is a keeper despite one little shortcoming. I must mention that I made it as is. I however do agree  with others that it  could do with just half the cranberries the recipe calls for. You are going to chop them anyway and in some way make it into more. I took someone else's tip of  sprinkling flour to the cranberries to for easy chopping. Please do. This will make your chopping experience faster and more  pleasant.  To appreciate the buttery flavor of this recipe it is necessary to cut the amount of cranberries. Despite that, the cookie came out very flavorful and buttery. Will  definitely make it again just with less cranberries.

After reading the reviews I decided to add half the cranberries and twice the orange zest. These were perfect. Definitely adding to the Christmas cookie list. I refrigerated them for about 6 hours and they were very easy to cut and didn't crumble at all.

Beautiful, delicate and very tasty!  I tripled the recipe, and 1/2 inch slices made well over the six dozen that I needed.  My butter was at room temperature when I beat it together with the sugar, and the dough was not crumbly at all.  Make sure that the dough is refrigerated until it is very firm (I left it overnight), and cutting is a breeze.

Were really wonderful, but, would cut back the cranberries to 1 cup next time-mine had many more than the featured picture, so I knew something was up when slicing them to bake. Too many berries for the amount of batter so they are very fragile cookies. Would also like them sweetened up just a tad when there are 2 cups of berries, drizzle with icing or melted white chocolate because there isn't enough shortbread to sweeten the tart berries. I take it all back and raised it one star. After serving these, everyone thought they were great! This year, I will try it with dried cherries!

I picked this cookie recipe because it came to my email as an item that would stand up to mailing and I wanted to send my son-in-laws and his deployed unit something different.  It really bothers me when people make changes to a recipe and then give it a bad rating.  I made this EXACTLY AS WRITTEN.  It crumbled when I rolled it, it crumbled when I cut it and then they crumbled when I put them on a rack to cool.  They crumbled when you picked one up to eat it.  Did someone forget the eggs?  I took the crumbled mess left over from slicing the batch into 1/2 pieces, softened, added an egg and re-rolled and re-chilled.  The remnants stayed together when cutting, lifting, cooling and handling.

I made these almost as directed.  I used 1 1/2 cups chopped Craisins (as some reviewers thought 2 cups was too much).  Of the 7" logs, I sliced the cookies just under the 1/2" mark as I thought they would make a really BIG cookie at 1/2".  I baked my cookies for 13  minutes as I felt the taste was doughy at 10 minutes, plus they fell apart when eating.  Cooking them for 13 minutes made the cookies just start to turn tan.  Next time I plan to make the log  longer so that I can slice them at 1/2".  One of my coworkers thought the citrus flavor was overpowering.  I liked these but may cut back on the zest next time as well; I did use a hefty tablespoon.  BTW recipe made 2 1/2 dozen cookies.

One of my all time favorite recipes. However, I like to use chocolate chips in mine or even plain. If I have leftover cookie dough I just freeze it, no need to cook since there's no eggs! For shaping them I actually use the top of a champagne glass, it works wonderfully. Amazing and easy cookies to make.

Just disappointed in this recipe! I love baking and i bake every single year, but this one just stressed me out. It asked for too many dry ingredients and i did not understand what the baking powder was for when not even eggs were needed. The dough came out so crumbly, i even tried adding a bit of water and then left the dough in the fridge as stated. A few hours i baked them and all i taste is weirdness. Just not at all the best i have ever made. I believe i rather stick with the ones i made/used and baked for years. Thumbs Down on this one!

These were just okay for me. They didn't seem to have much flavor, and I wonder if that was because I forgot to chop the cranberries. That might have distributed their flavor better.  They also seemed overly salted. I used salted butter, so I think next time I'll try the recipe without adding the salt that's called for. They firm as they cool. If you bake them till firm, they'll be burnt to a crisp.

Next time I will use half the cranberries and cut the cookies much thinner, they aren't quite crunchy enough. . Otherwise it's a pretty good recipe.

Made just as the recipe stated. When forming the logs though, I made mine 10" long, and after chilling for 4 hours cut the slices just over 1/4" thick. I got 4 1/2 dozen -- 2" cookies.  I baked them on a stoneware cookie sheet for 10 minutes and they came out perfect ( no spreading, and they look just like the photo) and the flavour is phenomenal!!!   This has been put into my list of cookies to make for future Christmases.  Though I will probably make them sooner.

These cookies are delicious.  I did as others and only used. 1 cup of chopped cranberries. It was more than enough.  To make for my vegan daughter I used non dairy vegan butter and they held very well.  I made some with nuts and some without.  Both delicious.  I didn't have any orange or lemon so I used tangerine rind.  They still came out citrusy.  I give this recipe 5 stars.  Thank you for sharing.

These are delicious and so easy to make, yet they look and taste "fancy" enough for holiday entertaining.  I must concur with other reviewers, 1 cup of cranberries is plenty.   I may experiment with different combinations of fruit and zest just for fun.  Great recipe, Donna, thanks!

These are my family's newest and best holiday fav cookie! Absolutely easy to make, but so dynamic is flavor and ease of baking! Learning from other responses to this cookie, by adding a bit of cornstarch to the dried cranberries before dicing, to ease the stickiness while chopping. Plus they are pretty to look at. So nice to see the colors on a cookie platter.

I‚Äôve made this recipe twice so far. The first time I followed the recipe exactly and they were very good, but not amazing. The second time, I swapped the lemon zest and dried cranberries out, and instead added dried cherries and chopped white chocolate and they taste incredible! We can‚Äôt stop eating them!!  This will become a holiday staple in our household, but with the dried cherries and white chocolate substitutions.

I made them for Christmas. I decided to cut the batch in half. I also rolled the log in powdered sugar. They taste so yummy!

This cookie didn't work out for me, sadly. I should have read the reviews first. I agree with other reviews, 2 cups of cranberry is too much, adding extra orange zest is something I did do and would do again.  I also thought they didn't bake up very "short" for shortbread cookies, they just didn't snap.

I used the dried cranberries, dried cherries and white chocolate chips and used a lot of the orange zest.  The flavor is SOOO good.  Instead of "flouring" the dried cranberries, I pulsed the dried fruit for a few seconds in my blender, and the consistency works so well!  It also makes the fruit burst with flavor!  The only thing I noticed is they do crumble a bit after you take them out, but I'm going to put them in decorative muffin cup liners for a Christmas Cookie Exchange to prevent them from crumbling.

I used a traditional recipe for shortbread ( see Rasberry and Almond shortbread thumbprints in allrecipies.com) that does not include any baking powder. Used only half of chopped cranberries, refrigerated Rolled dough logs overnight and cut into Approx 3/8‚Äù; baked per instructions. Loved  them!! Great holiday flavor and time-saving variation of shortbread.

My cookies turned out great. I did 3x the recipe for a cookie exchange at work. Only used 1 cup of cranberries per batch, as recommended. I also switched the amounts needed of almond extract and vanilla extract, also recommended by another reviewer. Zested a whole navel orange; I might try more next time. Then baked until slightly toasted on the bottom ‚Äî it was my first time making it, and I'm very satisfied with the result. Simply delicious!

These cookies have far too many craisins. I did make these with 1 to 1 Bob's GF baking flour. I must have baked for 18 minutes and they still barely setup. The flavor is good, I would probably cut the craisins on half to make them look like the pictures.  I probably will not use this recipe again.

This is a very nice twist on classic shortbread. I read the reviews and used about a teaspoon of flour to make the cranberries easier to chop and I used about 1.5 cups of cranberries.

I made this recipe exactly as written and the orange overpowered the other flavors. Two cups of chopped cranberries was twice as much as needed.  I made another batch of dough minus the cranberries and orange zest and mixed it with the first batch - big improvement!  Also rolled the logs in chopped unsalted pistachios.  That added a festive look and more flavor.  (See my photo)

For our taste, this was too heavy on the cranberries.   I needed to increase the baking time time to 12 minutes but that may be my oven.  Will reduce the amount of cranberries the next time.  Otherwise, a very good cookie and visually appealing..

I made these exactly (almost) as written.  I did not chop the cranberries because I like big chunks of them.  They were wonderful!  So wonderful that I went to the store to buy more cranberries so I could bake more to gift to my family out of state.!  They are delicate but have amazing flavor.  This is a new favorite!

First ones always the worst ones. I went by the directions and 2 cups of cranberries were WAY too much.  Hard to cut, and I had a good knife. Everytime I cut the cranberries would all fall out, which I didn't mind since there were way too many anyway.  I will be making them again and tweaking them. I liked the toasted almonds idea. And I had to add 5 minutes extra. Maybe I'll cut them a little thinner than 1/2 inch? Still love the idea.  Oh, and I forgot to chop the cranberries. lol. Won't do that again.

I added lemon juice and lemon zest instead of orange. It was a big hit.

Just like others have said, these cookies fell apart once I tried to cut them. I left these in the fridge for longer than 24 hours and they still crumbled when I tried to cut them.
Since I only had True Orange packets which each packet is equivalent to a wedge and used about 10, there was no orange flavor. I also think I got carried away with the Crisco butter shortening. Other than that these were OK. If I make these again I will look for the other shortbread recipe that I did that came out better than these.

Delicious! A definite make again. I could not get two cups chopped cranberries to mix in - I probably only used 1 1/4 cups. Do not over bake. Thank you for submitting!

Not at all how I expected. Chewy, not crunchy. The cranberries did not soften.  They sat around my house for two weeks before I tossed them.

My family LOVED this.  Made zero changes (except adding a whole orange's worth of zest).  Also, I don't feel it's necessary to chop the dried cranberries.   Highly recommend!

I followed the recipe exactly as listed and the consistency was not that of a proper shortbread, the taste was just awful, and after refrigerating the dough felt like a stick of butter. Something is just off with this recipe as is.

I have just made the dough to almost spec and it is delicious; didn't have enough cranberries for the full two cups. Now for my personal preference, I added more zest and a little more than a teaspoon of orange liquor and I am in heaven. I just hope it makes it to the oven to bake. Wonderful recipe. Thank you

These were the best shortbread I've ever baked!  The extra flavor from the almond and citrus really kick it up a notch.    I made them according to the recipe and wouldn't change a thing.  My new go-to recipe for shortbread.

I have made these twice and they are very good.  Not too sweet.  Letting the dough get stiff in the fridge before cutting is worth the wait for handling.

Delicious, simple cookies! I made one with orange and cranberry as written. They look lovely and taste great. I made a second batch with dark chocolate chunks, cut the orange, cranberry, and almond extract and added a little coarse sea salt. Excellent!

I substituted lemon for orange, thinking it would not change much, but maybe it did... This cookie was such a disappointment.  They were only salvaged by glazing them with a lemon glaze.  I did not use all the cranberries called for, and it was still WAY too much of them in the cookies.

This was the first shortbread I ever made!! The recipe is super easy to understand! I still make these and my family  loves them, they disappear as soon as they come out of the oven. I like to add lemon and orange extract for more of a citrus flavor because the cranberries tend to overpower!

Wonderful cookie!  I didn't add cranberries, substituted pecans.  1 dinner spoon full dough, formed into ball, then pressed into palm made wonderful small cookies.  I convection baked for 8 minutes at 350F.

This cookie was just an ‚Äúehh‚Äù for me. I probably disrespected this cookie by not allowing it to fulfill it‚Äôs confectionery destiny on a Christmas platter filled with an assortment of sweet, sticky cookies that leaves your tastebuds clammering for something subtle and slightly tangy to cleanse your palate.  In such an arena, I think this cookie would thrive. But, I made this cookie as a stand-alone dessert on a Saturday night, and it fell short of the after meal sweet treat my family was hoping for. Sorry, subtle little cranberry shortbread cookie - I feel like I let you down. Good luck to you in the future though. Love, Sharyn...

Wonderful cookies! 2 cups of cranberries would overwhelm them, I‚Äôm really glad I read some reviews and only used 1 cup. I didn‚Äôt make any other changes and they were perfect. I will be making many more batches!

These were good, but something was lacking in the texture.  They were not really of shortbread-like texture.  If I make them again, I will cut them thinner than recommended, hoping for a crisper cookie.

The roll was hard to slice and broke apart on me. Not sure what I did wrong. Cookies were very flavourful but I had a hard time getting the dough to stick together.

This is a very good shortbread cookie. When I make it again, I think I may reduce   the cranberries and add some almonds or just increase the almond extract to balance the flavors a bit.

I love these and make them every Xmas. The recipe is great as is - but for my taste, I halve the cranberries and eliminate the vanilla. Otherwise the beautiful butteriness gets overwhelmed! For those having problems with dry, crumbly dough - you must weigh your ingredients, especially the flour. Measuring by volume is not nearly as precise, and the correct proportions are important in shortbread! 1 c flour weighs 120g or 4.5 oz.

These are really easy shortbread cookies to make. They are hard to judge as they cook because you can‚Äôt tell that they‚Äôre done within the allotted time. I let my cook a little longer until I could just see a hint of color on the bottom edge. They came out fine. The only caution I would say is you really need to be exact on the salt. I eyeballed my salt since I didn‚Äôt have an eighth of a teaspoon, and I can taste it‚Äôs just a little too much. So be could be exact on the salt.

This is  a winner.  I subbed 1 C. fine chopped pistachios for 1 C. of cranberries and used a generous 2T orange zest.  Very flavorful and pretty on trays.  Drizzled with a glaze of powdered sugar and orange juice.

Sorry, but I will never make these again.  They were too crumbly to form into cookies even after being in the refrigerator overnight.  I put the crumbly logs into a bowl and added a tiny bit of mile to moisten them up rather than throwing away all those good ingredients.  That did the trick as far as being able to cut them into cookies.  But after they baked I found the citrus too overwhelming.  Overall, a  big disappointment.

I made the recipe exactly as it was and it was very good!  I think I may have taken the dough out of the frig at 3 hrs.  You can really taste the citrus from the orange zest and the cranberries were a nice chewy tart element which is what I hoped for!  The cookies also look very pretty.  Will definitely make again!

I made these exactly as written and they were delicious, rich but not too sweet with a great shortbread texture.  Be sure to refrigerate before baking (I left mine in the frig overnight), and use parchment paper for perfectly baked cookies. I'll definitely make these again.

Delicious simple shortbread cookie. I made them exactly as written. I think some reviewers that complained that they are not sweet enough need to realize that much of the sweetness comes from the cranberries, so if you eliminate half of the cranberries then they will not be as sweet. Perfect Christmas cookie!

OMG, these cookies were so good!  I just discovered the recipe last week and have already made 3 batches!  The only change I made was to omit the almond extract, simply because it isn't my preference.  I also was in a hurry with my third batch and opted for "resting" the dough 45 minutes in the freezer instead of 4 hours in the fridge, and they turned out just fine.

These are AWESOME!!!  I had no dried cranberries so I had to substitute dried cherries, but I think the rolls of dough would be wonderful in the freezer or fridge so you could bake off just a few as you wanted them.  These are so delicious and so pretty!  WOW!

I made the mistake of listening to another reviewer and sliced these closer to 1/4" thick...what a mistake!  I didn't like them at all, they were bland without much flavor.  I even used almost the full 2 cups of cranberries despite the fact that many reviewers said it was too much.  Still not much flavor.  I sprinkled sugar on top before they went into the oven and they tasted better.  But what I found was, they have to be sliced at least 1/2" thick to get the true taste/texture of shortbread.  Even though I doubled the orange zest, I think it still needed something more.  I'm not sure that I would make these again, there are many more recipes to try.  I guess I was somewhat disappointed overall.  I really wanted these to have a "wow" factor...but they didn't.

A few changes I made as per suggestions: Only 1 cup of dried cranberry raisins and it still has plenty of flavour. I also skipped the almond extract and used orange extract instead. Lovely cookies that I would make again and again!!

This is a great recipe. I always sift the flour (after measuring), which may solve the problem others had with pulling the dough together. I also bake at 325 (other recipes call for this temp).

Very easy and delicious cookie. Pretty too. I only used one cup of  chopped cranberry which was more than enough. Made them with mini chocolate chips that were great too. Served them at a neighborhood gathering and they were the hit of the dessert table.

I used orange extract rather than almond, mostly because I don't care for almond and had none on my supply shelf.  I also added about 1/2 the juice from the orange I zested.  My friends have asked for the recipe so it seems the changes did not negatively impact a very good cookie.

The first batch came out so good, my family and co-workers couldn't get enough, that I have made 4 batches already and plan on making 4 more for the holidays! I have a friend that is allergic to oranges so I made one batch with lemon zest instead - they were just as good although a bit milder in citrus flavor.

There are many varieties out there on this cookie, I use the one by MaryAnn Esposito of Ciao Italia for years now.  She adds pistachios which add the color green to the red of the cranberries.  You can use any dried fruit, even chopped apricots, use what's handy in the proportions that the recipe gives and it's all good. These are my favorite cookie I make each year, simple too.

The only change I did was what someone suggested. I used only 1 cup of cranberries. My family loves these cookies. Definitely a keeper.

These are absolutely delicious! Thank you so much for the recipe. I'll be making these every Christmas. They are the perfect shortbread cookies. I don't know what some of the reviews are talking about when they say it's all crumbly.....I followed the recipe exactly and it wasn't at all. I put in the refrigerator for 3 hours, cut perfect, baked for 15 minutes using an airbake pan. They look just like the picture! Love, love, love!

The only thing I found was when it came to rolling the dough into logs it was quite crumbley so I added a touch more butter and a tiny bit of water and it became softer to roll out. The rest was perfect! Great recipe.

I have never made any changes other than to dip the tops of baked cookies into a thin cream cheese frosting. These have been my favorite cookies for the 2 years since I found the recipe and I bake a batch every 2 or 3 months. With the holidays coming I thought I'd bake up a double batch to take to work and share. Three dozen cookies were gone in an hour and those who got to taste them were asking for more and those who didn't get to them in time asked when I would make them again.  So it's not only myself that recommends these delicious cookies.

I have actually made this once before, but I have the dough sitting in the fridge as I write this.  I LOVE this recipe!  I made a couple small changes though:  I decreased the cranberries to 1 cup, I zested a whole orange AND a whole lemon, and I omitted the almond extract (because I'm not a fan of it).  The last time I made it, it made a great dough (as it did today as well), but, I did feel that the finished cookie needed something extra...a glaze would work well, but I have chosen to dip each cookie in white chocolate to pair with the citrus fruit.  In my opinion, that made the cookie PERFECT.  I plan to do the same today!  These will go in my freezer for when my family comes to visit in a couple weeks.  I rated a 4/5 since I did change a couple things to the original recipe since I thought it was lacking for my own personal taste.  GREAT shortbread dough though!  I would highly recommend this recipe.  Try the original for yourself and make it your own. :)

I didn't make any changes, but the cookies were dry and powdery for some reason. I was using a new brand of all purpose flour, could be that. Couldn't really taste the citrus part, just cranberries.

These just didn't hit that shortbread note for me.  I'm not sure exactly why, but they more dry and crumbly and lacked a crispness.

Excellent recipe. I've even made many variations of this. I just omit the cranberries, zest, and almond extract and use that as a base. I've made cut out cookies with this recipe as well with just sugar on top. I've also made ice box cookies and matcha cookies. The possibilities are endless with this recipe! The trick is to really whip the butter first. Gives it a nice light texture.

I tried the recipe twice and the second time I cut the ingredients half and made shortbread into one bite size. So satisfying! I also replaced with 1/4 brown sugar and it turned out just perfect as well.

Wonderful cookie and quite easy to make. The dough can be difficult to cut at room temperature so keep it in the fridge when not cutting. I use just over 1 cup of cranberries and that seems like plenty.

Loved these cookies! They are not too sweet, but all the butter makes them tender. The combination of orange and cranberry is a winner. The only mistake I made was I left them in the oven too long. They didn't seem done at ten minutes, so I left them in for longer. Do yourself a favor and just take them out after the time suggested in the recipe.

I have added this to my annual Christmas goodies list. My entire family loved them so much, I had to make 2 more batches because we kept running out. They are the perfect not so sweet cookie and taste just like Christmas. Plus they are so easy to make!!

These are just delightful cookies for  Christmas. I did add a cup of slivered, toasted almonds to them, and I made four rolls, a bit smaller in diameter than the recipe called for. I cut them about 1/4 of an inch thick. I made three batches of these and added them to the many Christmas cookie baskets I made for friends and neighbors.  Thanks for the new inspiration; I'll surely make these every year from now on - and I like them so much, perhaps I'll even make them when it isn't Christmas.

I love these cookies!  My first try, I had the same issues others had, to where it was too dry and crumbly...but after having made many more batches after that...it was clearly my error.  I have made three batches since and they have been delightful and not even close to dry and crumbly.  I did heed the advice of others and just used 1 cup of chopped cranberries and that was perfect.  I have also adjusted the recipe to just use pecans in one batch and almonds in another.  I love how versatile this recipe is.  Thank you for sharing!  I for sure will be making these cookies on a regular basis.

Lovely! I used the juice of 1/2 a small lemon instead of the extracts and 1 tablespoon of lemon zest. I also used 1 cup of finely chopped fresh cranberries. Shaping into rolls and refrigerating over night made them a breeze to cut into 1/2" slices. Baking time was a little longer (closer to 15 minutes) and after the cookies cooled I drizzled them with a glaze of powdered sugar and lemon juice.  Very picturesque cookies that taste as good as they look.

Delicious, tender shortbread. I didn't change anything. Follow the recipe and you will have success. Like most shortbread these cookies will mellow and improve with a little age so feel free to make them in advance and know they'll taste great later on.

Very nice cookie, I didn't have a problem with it being too dry.  Next time I may cut the cranberries to 1 or 1 1/2 c.  2 cups seemed a little much!

I've made these little gems twice now!  Once for my neighbors  Christmas goodie plate's and once  for my family Christmas party. They are quite delicious!
My sisters could not get over how yummy they were ‚Äì ‚Äì and I could not believe the ease of making them. 
 The first recipe I made to spec. And as wonderful as they were, I thought I would change up the extracts a tad  to create a slightly different flavor. So I used 2 teaspoons almond extract and 1 teaspoon vanilla. I also put chopped pecans in both batches to make them more like Pecan  Sandies.  So delightful and delicious ~light crunch and melt in your mouth buttery goodness! This cookie  will stay on the Christmas goodies make  list! Thanks so much for sharing it!

For the past two years we have made these for our Christmas Cookie tray. They really compliment with the heavier sweeter cookies offering almost a light and refreshing element. These cookies are my daughter's favorite and we don't change anything about the directions (outside i do add a little more than a tablespoon of fresh orange zest)

Just made these last night and baked them in the morning for an early cookie exchange.   They are a delicious cookie - light, buttery with delicious cranberry flavor.   Like other comments, I reduced the amount of cranberries to 1 cup and that was plenty.  I also used unsweetened dried cranberries and chopped them in the food processor.  Next time I will add more orange zest.   They did need to bake longer than the 10 minutes called for.  I baked them for 13 minutes at 350 and they turned out perfect.  They're also an easy cookie that I'll definitely make again!

You can even make this Gluten free!  Lovely recipe without changing a thing. Melt in your mouth buttery goodness, and just the right amount of sweetness. I've made several batches, I've also made these using a Gluten Free all purpose flour, and they turned out just as perfect.  Like other reviewers I decrease  Craisins to 1 C, and increase the orange zest to 2 Tbl.  I used my KithenAid to whip up just slightly softened butter before adding the confectioners sugar, vanilla and almond extract.  When the rest of the ingredients are added the dough  holds together perfectly. Definitely freeze your dough for at least two hours before cutting/baking. This is a  very pretty cookie, perfect  for Holiday gifting.

Love a good shortbread cookie ! With the addition of citrus and the dried cranberries this one had little bit different twist. Saving this recipe for sure!

I used 1 and 1/2 cups of  cranberries after reading other reviews. I thought they turned out very good I like cranberries so do not think 1 cup would have been enough.

This cookie recipe is delicious! A delicate, buttery shortbread cookie with perfect crumb and mouth feel. I am making a second batch today the first was so good! I like to soak my cranberries in orange juice which I nuke in the microwave. Makes them softer and adds more orange flavor. (I didn't wait to air dry them so I needed to add a bit more confection sugar to compensate for the extra moisture.) I don't use almond extract - just a matter of personal taste.. For this batch I am trying Fiori di Sicily in place of vanilla which is a heavenly citrus/vanilla flavoring. The scent is divine! (It is stronger than vanilla so use less.) For Christmas cookies, the addition of pistachio makes a beautiful red, green and white cookie. This cookie is similar to one in Gourmet Magazine from years ago but honestly, this recipe is much, much better. Thanks so much for your recipe - my new fave!

Great recipe. I cut back on cranberries by 1/2 c. Loved the citrus flavour. The citrus has taken this recipe to a new level. This is a keeper. Thank you. Merry Christmas.

This cookie looked just like the pictures. It was a lovely addition to my cookie tray. I reduced the craisins to 1 cup. I think it needed a bit more almon flavor or a bit more orange zest. It may have been my error. I will definitely add this to my regular list of Christmas cookies.

The cookies had a wonderful combination of flavors with the berries and orange zest . I would add less cranberries by a 1/2 cup. Make sure to freeze the rolled dough overnight so that it can be sliced easily.  The tartness offset the rich buttery shortbread dough! Good with a cup of coffee or hot tea on a winter's afternoon.

Meh...these were just ok. I'm probably not going to make them again. I love cranberry and orange together but this was just cranberry and a hint of orange even with only half the cranberries the recipe called for and an additional teaspoon of orange extract. I gave them only 2 stars since the recipe calls for a ridiculous amount of cranberries that could never work.

This cookie was very easy to make, but I'm not sure I like the flavor of the orange zest and I don't care for the almond extract. Next time I will make it without those two ingredients.

Made this recipe "as is" and they were perfect for a holiday plate, with another log left for next week. Using 2 C of cranberries added the ideal sweetness & beauty. The extracts were not dominant. Be sure to bake with unsalted butter. If you're sure to fluff the flour to measure it, the dough will not be too dry. The only thing I did after reading reviews was to slice cookies thinner, closer to 1/4" inch and baked on a Silpat. Also watch closely not to brown. Almost nothing goes together as well as orange & cranberry! Very festive.

This is an awesome shortbread recipe!  I followed the recipe except for adding only 6oz of dried cranberries. I did add a handful of chopped pecans with a teaspoon of orange juice to one batch. Both batches came out beautifully.  The shortbread is light and flakey.  I am going to drizzle some white chocolate on the finished cookies before serving.  This recipe is definitely going into my holiday repertoire.

These are truly to die for.  Made these for a Christmas cookie exchange and they were the best shortbread cookies I have ever made or tasted. I added a touch more orange zest, and it was just right.  Only downer was they only made 3.5 dozen, so I had to make another batch.  But I can't complain, more of these on hand isn't a bad thing (unless you are trying to lose weight :))

I made with apricot's because its what I had on hand.  This is a fantastic recipe.  In my opinion though, 2 C of apricots is way too much.  I would recommend holding off to 1 c and supplement the other cup for almonds. Easy recipe and a keeper for sure!

I made this cookie for this coming Christmas, although, I don't think they will last! So yummy! I doubled the recipe and is very flavorful. I noticed it did take longer than the 10 min. to bake. I was thinking of dropping one end into some melted white chocolate about 1/3rd 1/2 way up the cookie. Great recipe! Thank you for sharing it!!

I liked it but I'm surprised no one else seemed to think 2 cups of chopped cranberries were way too much.  I only ended up using 1.5 cups and could have easily taken it down to 1 cup.  Aside from that, it's a very tasty and easy recipe.

Made these for Christmas this year.  After reading over the recipe, l thought 2 cups of cranberries was a bit too many so I only used 1 cup.  Also, only used 1/2 tsp of vanilla instead of 2 tsp - with the 1/2 tsp of almond extract, it was good.  I think the next time I make them, I'll use 1/2 cup of cranberries and 1/2 cup of chopped nuts.  Tasty recipe.  Thanks!

What an ‚Äúawesome‚Äù cookie recipe! This recipe was so easy to follow and they came out perfect! However I did cut back to only 1 cup of cranberries and didn't regret it. Thank you so very much! I will definitely make these for Christmas for sure, for many to enjoy.

I didn't change anything although a made another version where I replaced the almond extract with peppermint extract, 1/2 cup of mini-chocolate chips for the cranberries and omitted the orange zest. With those I put buttercream frosting on top with crushed peppermint candy cane. Both versions were a big hit with family and friends.

These are delicious and a nice addition to a cookie tray. I used a cup and a half of cranberries, and might cut it down to a cup or a cup and a quarter next time. I baked one log after chilling, and froze the other one so I could have fresh cookies another day.

Absolutely delicious!  After reading through the reviews, I opted to decrease the amount of cranberries, but only by 1/2 cup as I love cranberries.  The tartness of the cranberries and the sweetness of the cookie with a subtle taste of orange -- it's my new favorite cookie.  Next time I might substitute orange oil for part of the vanilla to give it  more of an orange taste, but wonderful as is!

Excellent shortbread recipe!  I poured over numerous recipes before settling on this one.  I made a few changes:  I omitted the cranberries and almond extract.  I added the zest of two small oranges, 1/2 cup toasted pecans, and 1/4 cup chopped dark chocolate.  Delicious!  A very crisp and buttery cookie that just melts in your mouth.  Perfect for the holidays.  Not too sweet, either.  I will try making this in the Summer, using lemon zest, no chocolate, and dusting with powered sugar. This one is a keeper!

Delicious! Light, buttery, refreshing citrus flavored shortbread cookies. Per others suggestions I cut the dried cranberries to one cup and that was plenty. Thanks for sharing a new holiday favorite!

These are incredible.  They are probably the most delicious cookie I've ever made and I've made my fair share.  The recipe is super simple.  I did reduce the cranberries to 1 cup and it was plenty.  I will be making these again!

I followed this recipe pretty much exactly, except I used 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and 2 teaspoons of almond extract. My orange zest was from a fresh orange.

I want to talk about the shortbread without all the extra stuff in it. It is the best shortbread  I have ever had in my life!  The added fruit took it over the top. I feel like could go anywhere with this recipe with that perfect shortbread base. I would like to try blueany wherever berry's  or cherry craisins. I only have one complaint: shortbread does not spread out or ride so I only got one plate of cookies even though I doubled the recipe. I will however add this to my Christmas cookie tradition .

These were absolutely wonderful!

Amazing!!  I added a little more orange zest and rolled the rolls of dough in colored sugar.  No other changes and these cookies are remarkable.  Not too sweet but as shortbread should be.

These turned out beautifully. I only altered the recipe a bit, since I didn't have any almond extract. I used lemon to give it a bit more of a citrus kick in addition to the orange zest. I topped them with some glaze.

Absolutely perfect! I made only a half batch to test it out. I only used half of the recommended craisins and minced them finely. Also I only used vanilla. I baked for the full 10 minutes, maybe because I'm at high altitude. I think I'll be using this recipe as a base because the texture is perfect. Thank you for sharing your recipe!!

Excellent! These taste the same as the delicious target cranberry orange scones. 
I just found it difficult to slice through the roll without getting caught on the cranberries. I used just one cup of cranberries.

The recipe was a flop. I followed the instructions, even putting the dough in the freezer to make sure it was indeed firm when handling to cut the cookies (thawed in frig overnight). The cookies ended up being one flat greasy, mess on the pan. The mono-piece that came out just crumbled apart and didn't taste good. I really wanted this to work out - it sounded like such a good idea - but it failed. I'm usually really good at baking, especially cookies, so I'm baffled.

My daughter loved these! I think they are pretty great too. I doubled the recipe, used 2 tsp vanilla and 2 tsp almond extract and used one package of Craisins since many reviewers said they reduced the amount by half. I can't recall what the size was but it was probably 2 cups total or maybe a little less and there were plenty of cranberry bits in each cookie. I did a quick, rough chop of the cranberries before adding, chilled dough rolls overnight and used a very sharp knife to cut the cookies. I used a ruler to make one centimeter slices which is approx. 3/8ths of an inch and reduced the baking time accordingly. Yummy and very pretty on the Christmas tray!

Delicious cookies. I baked them as instructed with ingredients and measurements listed. The recipe made 28 cookies and they baked for 15 minutes. The only thing I would probably change next time is to cut the cranberries to 1 cup instead of 2 cups. I love cranberries but some thought they had too many cranberries.

I thought these were great cookies.  Like many others, I did not use 2 cups of cranberries.  I just added the small package I had and used the zest of a whole orange.  Yummy!

These cookies were dry and crumbly.  Out of the 7 recipes I used for cookie trays this year these were the only ones that bombed.  A waste of time and ingredients, no one liked them.
