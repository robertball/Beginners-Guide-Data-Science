Not impressed. They are too mild in taste and not hot at all. I recently treid another spicy nut recipe on this site that had incredible flavor and was both sweet & spicy. I think the name of the person who submitted it is Karla. ANyway, the only issue w/ it is the nuts tend to stick together so what I did was take the egg white idea from this recipe and use it on hers and the nuts didn't stick as much.

These nuts have a nice flavor, but are very mild.  With all the seasonings, I would have thought they would be much spicier.  And they are NOT hot!  If you want them hot, I would suggest at least doubling the red pepper!

This was my first try at roasting nuts.  The flavor like the others said is mild and not hot at all.  I also thought it needed some salt added to it. And depending on how hot you like thing I would start with 1 tsp and work my way up.  The thing I like most was that by using the egg white instead of butter made it healthier. Over all the flavor was very good I would probably add a 1/4 more of everything if you like to taste the spices.

These nuts were yummy.  I made them for my family at Thanksgiving and received many compliments.  The almonds were a bit chewy.  I think I will leave them out next time.
