This was delish.  Only made a few changes. Omitted the cinnamon and added a 1/2 tsp almond extract.  Used buttermilk instead of milk and used all butter, no shortening.  Will make again.

I made this recipe for my husband and he almost ate the entire dessert by himself. The only thing he said was that could have made better by adding more of the topping on it. Other then that it was great.

Yummy! I made a gluten version  (used gluten free all purpose flour instead of regular). I enjoyed it thoroughly. :)

Absolutely delicious! I doubled the recipe and I’m glad I did because it wouldn’t have lasted long! I’m looking forward to our next church carry in, I will volunteer for desserts!

Made it twice second time had to add red food coloring. Maybe cherries not as ripe second time. Biscuit topping a little heavy. Hub liked it but seems like recipe needs a little something to make it great.

I followed the recipe exactly. I did not care for the taste of the filling--it congealed after it set up. I felt there was too much topping to filling and topping was a bit dry.  It definitely needed vanilla icecream on top to add some contrast flavor.  I would recommend adding another bag of cherries to this and to dry the cherries off with a paper towel after thawing and before adding them to the mixture. I won't be using this recipe again.

This cobbler was delicious and definitely a keeper!
I couldn't find a bag of frozen organic dark sweet cherries so I used the organic "cherry berry" frozen mix available at CostCo and picked out the strawberries prior to thawing (to use in smoothies later). The shortening I used for the topping was very cold butter and I cut it into the flour mixture just like making a pie crust. It was fabulous!

This is a great recipe, but I did not have shortening. It was okay and I used oil. I also added a bit of lemon zest to the cherries as they simmered. It made a bit difference I think. Enjoy!

The cherry mixture turned into gelatin which we did not care for. I'm not sure what I did wrong.
