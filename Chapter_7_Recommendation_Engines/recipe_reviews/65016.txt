What did I do wrong? The stuffing was good, but my chops were tough.

We don't usually prefer pork chops-but we do now!  These were incredibly simple and fantastic.  I almost doubled the filling for 6 chops and it was perfect.  We also seasoned the chops with a little poultry seasoning before browning and used apple cider for the sauce because that is all we had. Even my picky 5 year old that barely eats meat had 3 servings.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Unfortunatly my grocery store had some SAD looking porkchops, so I purchased a plain (not pre-seasoned) pork tenderloin, cut it open, pounded it (almost) flat, filled it with the exact recipe as above, tied it closed with twine and toothpicks and cooked it for the amount of time as above.  Very good, my husband loved it and he is picky!

I made this for a dinner party and it turned out phenomenal.  I had leftover stuffing, so I mixed it in with the glaze so it cooked up as the glaze reduced.  Got rave reviews

I dusted the chops with sage, thyme, salt and pepper.  I bought butterflied pork chops so I put the stuffing on the top.  I fried in olive oil for only 45 sec. each side and baked for 30 min.  The pork was moist and tender enough to cut with a fork.  Loved the flavors.

This was great! I added about a cup of fresh breadcrumbs and stuffed a pork tenderloin.  Seared the tenderloin in a cast iron pan then trasferred to a 350 degree oven for an hour. My husband and I loved it!

This recipe was amazing! My boyfriend and I prepared it last night and it was the best meal we have ever made together.  The apple and cranberry blended well to give the pork an excellent taste. Plus it was fairly easy to prepare.  I will definitely make this dish again!

I followed this recipe with the exception of browning the meat and then stuffing, and adding 1/4 cup of parmassion cheese to the stuffing. The sauce was great. I'll make it again!

YUMMY!!! My Daughter and I loved this. I used pork tenderloin, which I cut into thick porkchops. Next time I will cut the brown sugar to 1 TBSP, it was a little to sweet. Will make again!!

Very good flavor.  My husband loved it and doesn't usually like "fruit with meat"!  I liked that there wasn't any bread in the stuffing..less carbs meant I could serve mashed potatoes with it.  Keeper.

I made this several times for cocktail parties. It was a big hit! My friend's mother who never likes other people's cooking LOVED these pork chops! It was a success every time. I like to switch the yellow onion for green onions though, that was my only change.

This was SOOOOOOOOOO good! I used golden raisins instead of cranberries because I had them on hand. Also used fiji apples because I had them. This seemed very fancy for a weeknight dinner but was super easy and delicious. I cooked 2 for my husband, 2 year old and myself. I should have checked sooner but the temp was at around 180 when I checked after 35 minutes. The best part was my very picky 2 year old LOVED them. Probably because they were sweet. But I was impressed by all the flavor for a very healthy recipe. Next time I was thinking of adding chopped pecans too.

WOWZERS!! This was mighty fine. I doubled the stuffing mixture even though only 5 people were eating, but I like having extra stuffing. I didnt have enough apple juice but this still turned out good. Didnt change anything and was great. Hubby raved for hours!

Delicious!--raves from husband and guests.  Actually could be a great make ahead item--prepare thru browning then refrigerate and bake when needed. Suggest
reheating on top of stove before oven baking to keep time consistant.  Moist--flavorful and a healthy stuffing!

Really good. I omitted the celery and added a second granny smith apple. Used two very thick large chops and had a little extra sauce. The fruit stuffing kept the chops nice and moist, and the fruit stuffing that didnt fit in the chops was left in the reduction. otherwise I followed the recipe as written. Perfect combo of tart & sweet. I would serve this at a dinner part but would probably double the sauce because it is so delicious. A great autum dish.

I personally  loved this, I made it like one of the reviewers in a pork tenderloin... The only reason I am giving it so few stars is that two of my four kids didn't really eat it and i don't want to accidently make it again for them.  I will however make it for dinner parties like the reviewer.

My husband requested stuffed pork chops for his birthday dinner last week. I found this recipe and it was great. I recalculated the recipe for 2. It only took 1/2 hour to bake.

For a taste of real comfort food, this is it! I used fresh cranberries (half a cup) and cut down the sugar by half. Also, I used the same amount of stuffing for 3 pork chops. Yummy! Thank you for sharing this great home made recipe.

The glaze was good. I substitued the brown sugar with sugar free pancake syrup. Excellent flavor. I did find the pork chops failed to brown. The stuffing was very good however. I think the next time I will brown the chops a bit more prior to baking. I will also take the lid off the pot for ten minutes while in the oven to attempt to brown the chops more.

alright, but couldn't really taste anything but the celery.  It would also be good to just skip the stuffing and put the sauce on grilled pork chops.

This turned out very well!  Very moist. I am not terribly skilled with a knife though, so these ended up as smothered, not stuffed.  I put some of the mix below and then put the rest on the top.   I followed other people's advice and checked the temp a few times. Next time I think I will add a bit of chicken broth and dried bread cubes to the cranberry mix.

We made this recipe for a Christmas dinner party and they turned out fantastic.  We substituted half of the servings with large boneless chicken breasts and these seemed to be everyones favorite, the chicken stayed nice and juicy but the chops were a bit dried out.  In any case, the blend of flavors were wonderful.

These were wonderful.  I will cook mine a little less next time (they were a bit dried out, but I think that was my fault)  The taste was fantastic- I added the extra stuffing  to the pan during the roasting time and then used whatever fell out of the chops in the sauce, too!  Even DH who doesn't like pork really liked them.  This was an easy to follow recipe that didn't require a gourmet store shopping trip, yet it's special enough to serve to guests.  Thank you!

I found these to be very good.  I changed it up by adding sage and thyme to both the stuffing and the sauce.  I also added garlic and wine to the sauce.  Thanx for the recipe!

This was a great recipe subbed raisins for the cranberries. I prefer it without the glaze myself but my children of course like it better with.

The stuffing had great flavor but the chops were tough. I tried it a second time but I drizzled some canola oil on the chops and grilled them over hardwood charcoal. I used the indirect heating method with apple and cherry wood chips to smoke them with. YUM. That method gets 5 stars.

Great stuffing for the chops! I made the same stuffing for boneless chicken breasts too.  They were both good.

This was so good!  I doubled all the stuffing as well as the glaze.  I had HUGE pork chops to fill.  I covered and baked at 400 for 15 minutes and then took the cover off and baked for another ten.  Perfect!  Served with sugar snap peas and mashed potatoes.  Will definitely add this to my recipe box!

Oh my gosh! Wonderful recipe! But when getting ready to make for the 3rd time, to my surprise I realized I had been making it wrong. I added the apples, onions and celery to a box of prepared stuffing mix (used pork or chicken flavored)and made everything else the same. But because we loved it the way I've made it before, (adding actual stuffing) we will keep on making it this way. Thank you for an amazing recipe!

Have made many times. Changed nothing in recipe, but I do buy my own pork loin and cut to my liking, which for this is thick about 2-3 inches.
5/26/19 - Made it again tonight for company. I screwed up and forgot to put the cranberries in the stuffing. No worries though. I added them to the sauce which I doubled and then 10 minutes before it was done I poured about half over the chops and finished cooking them. I added more sauce over them just before serving. Scrumptious.

Deelish!! Wow!  I only tweeked it a little bit.  I don't have a dutch oven so I simply used a large pan to do most of the grunt work.  I used fresh cranberries instead of dried berries and I also cubed a few slices of white bread for the stuffing. I didn't have brown sugar so I used one tablespoon of white sugar and used cider instead of juice.  This was time consuming to say the least...but SO worth it! Thank you!

Took 35 minutes at 350 to reach temperature of 160 degrees. They weren't especially tough like other reviews said. However, I didn't think the stuffing was that good. Next time I think I'll just add dried cranberries to a normal stuffing recipe.

I loved these chops! Mine came out dry after 45mins in the oven. Next time im going to try wrapping  them in aluminum and only baking them for 10-15mins. Seems like cooking them for 2 minutes in the frying pan does a good job of cooking them.

I love this recipe. Reaffirms my belief that every cook should invest in a dutch oven.Suggestion: any left over "stuffing just sprinkle over the top of chops before baking. Pork chops are juicy, flavorful and there is enough liquid in the pan to make a decent sauce. I did not have apple juice so I made a simple reduction of red wine and some brown sugar. Delicious. Easy. You could add a little butter to that if you wish for more richness. I served with fresh asparagus and warm French bread   to wipe the plate clean.(as the French do) Very yum.

This recipe is PERFECT. It’s got great taste, the juicy chop and never would have come with the stuffing on my own. It is perfectly complimented with mashed potato and asparagus. We also served with spinach strawberry salad. Excellent and will be making again. It’s not a heavy dish , which I loved.

Excellent dish that if you have a little time comes off very tasty. I browned the chops longer than 2 minutes because it just didn't have the color I like - the 45 min bake will cook it through and as one user suggested having any leftover stuffing goes perfectly in the glaze to drip over top of the chops - I served with Rosemary potatoes & the 2 were a match in heaven. You have to make this dish.

The stuffing was delicious but the chops were tough, I think that browning first was the problem, will try again but will double the stuffing and cook them directly in the pan, no oven. Either that or use a pork tenderlion.

Excellent recipe! I made this almost as written and grilled them (too warm outside to cook inside)! I had a bone-in center cut pork chop about 2 inches thick. Scaled recipe down to 2 or 3 servings and had a little excess filling left. Although not necessary to do, I added about 1/4 cup plain, gluten free, bread crumbs to give it a sort of stuffing like texture. The glaze was excellent on top of the chops. The pork chop came out very moist/tender, but I did brine them first using a recipe from Baking Nana (http://bakingnana.com/to-brine-or-not-to-brine/), rinsed chops, and then proceeded to following this recipe. Brining is not necessary in this recipe, but brining in general does help with tender and juicy meat. A little flavor from the brine with the orange really complimented the apple cranberry stuffing in this recipe though. I look forward to making this recipe again and following the bake method. I'll update the review when I do if the 45 minutes is too long for these pork chops. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Love this recipe.  Will make again and again.  The only change I will make is to not pan fry the chops for 2 minutes per side.  Instead I will quickly sear each side and then place in the oven as directed. The chops came out a bit dry but with the glaze they were very good.  By reducing the pan frying to just searing will undoubtedly help the chops from drying out.

This recipe's a keeper! Who wouldn't like the sweet-salty-tangy apple and cranberry stuffing?  Just don't omit the sauce --- that's the real 'cherry-on-top" clincher!  I must admit that I didn't have apple juice on hand, so substituted hard cider (maybe that's why the sauce was so good?).

I had leftover dressing, some of which I added to the sauce.  It added texture and color.  The sauce is wonderful by the way.

Pork loin chops are lean and, therefore, tend to be tough if overcooked.  Next time, I will sear at a higher heat to minimize internal cooking and bake at a lower temperature. I think that I might also increase the thickness of the chops from 1" to 1-1/2".

Cooking for 45 minutes made the chops very dry. I wish that I'd used a meat thermometer instead of the timer.

I've made this several times. It seemed to be missing something and the sauce just tasted like thickened apple juice. The last time I made it I poured about 1/3 cup dry white wine over the chops and used the drippings plus enough apple juice to make the sauce. Perfect!

I like pork in general, but am typically not a fan of pork chops. That changed with this recipe. I've made it several times now, and it's fantastic. I season the chops with sage, salt, pepper, and garlic powder, and also add a bit of sage to the stuffing. I usually have leftovers stuffing, so I put it on top of the chops while they're baking and then top with the sauce when they are done. My husband loves it when I make these chops.

You need to watch cook time. I stopped 10 minutes early and could have stopped earlier - a little tough.  BUT Really nummy and I will make again with less cook time.

This is an amazing refreshing pork chop dish!  I have made it by stuffing them and by just layering the stuffing on top of the porkchops.  My kids went crazy for it bc is is sweet and my husband who is a chef loved it so much that he is considering adding his version to his menu.  And it is so easy to make.  Definitely a huge hit at our house.

This was a great recipe, the sauce really added the extra moisture that makes this dish great.

I made this for Christmas dinner, except I stuffed a pork loin instead of pork chops.  It turned out great, but I did have to make slightly more stuffing than the recipe called for.  Even my husband liked it and he usually won't eat pork.  Also the glaze was delicious.

There really wasn't much to the stuffing...  I decided to just add the cranberries to my regular bread/apple stuffing

This is a very tasty dish.  My 9 year old daughter can be very picky but she even asked for seconds. It's definately a keeper!

This recipe was phenomenal.  The flavors were a great blend together; I like how the veggies and fruit didn't turn to complete mush when cooking.  The sauce had a nice sweetness to it without tasting like sugar and was a great compliment to the chops.  I served this with a sweet potato gratin and yum-o!  

The only think I did different was before browning the pork chops, I put a rosemary blend on the chops.

Great flavor! Because the pork chops are covered they turn out very tender. However, they do shrink a bit.

Very good!  I used cranberry sauce instead of dried cranberries.  It was delicious.
