I use hot pepper jelly. I entertain regularly and this is so easy and delicious. I have also discovered that you can mix tabasco and strawberry jelly for the same effect.

I don't know about hot sauce, but this is a great, easy recipe when you use salsa instead of hot sauce.  A popular favorite at texas get togethers.

This is one of my favorite snacks.  It is so quick and easy.  I use sweet chile sauce over the cream cheese.  This is my comfort food.  When I eat this, I'm in heaven!

How easy can you get?  I've been serving a version of this for years.  We like a medium spicy salsa served with wheat thins crackers.  A classic snack.

I had crackers and cheese last night and decided to make this as one of the cheese choices. It was definitely the least favorite. It didn't look good and the two flavors didn't go well together. The next time I'm in the mood for some spicy cheese I'll just buy some havarti with jalepenos.

This is just like a recipe my boyfriend's dad uses.  You can also use plain worchestershire sauce!  It is sooo easy and everyone loves it :)

this is a very quick, easy and yummy. It was a big hit. To make it look a little better I rounded the edges on the cream cheese and then put the jelly on it. I've made this several times now.

I make this with hot pepper jelly on top.  At Christmastime it looks great with either the red or green hot pepper jelly.  I've also tasted it with grape jelly on it.  Love how easy it is to give it a different flavor.

I didn't have Jamaican hot sauce so I subbed a thick hot sauce and garnished with green onions. I love hot sauce and cream cheese on crackers.

No changes needed. You can't mess up cream cheese. Yum!
