Very cute ! Fun.  
Black Shoe Lace Licorice ! GOOD LUCK FINDING- This is what I did and found (licorice wheels unroll and pulled the two strings apart also pull apart licorice in the Berry (dark purple Color) Black not available.   If you want to know more on WHY YOU CAN'T HARDLY FIND BLACK SHOE LACE LICORICE READ BELOW:
In regards to the Black Shoe Lace Licorice.  I called over 20 stores in my area and visited serveral with no avail.  I ended up Calling Kraft, Hershey, Farley Sanders etc. to find out what the deal was.
They don't make it anymore and gave me a number in my state to check with smaller a candy Company.  They inturn helped me find the product. GOOD LUCK !  The customer service depts at the big candy makers said they would put in their 2 cents for selling it around Halloween/ fall because various RECEIPES and PROJECTS CALL FOR IT.

These are pretty cute to make. I suggest inserting the licorice into the cupcakes before frosting them...it made it so much easier this way. Also, I couldn't find black licorice ropes so I used red Twizzlers Pull and Peel. Next time I'll use decorators gel and add 2 dots for nostrils for the spiders nose. I couldn't find orange crystals so I just tinted the white frosting orange and it looked fine. Recommended for Halloween parties for sure!! I hope the kids enjoy these at my son's school party!!! Thanks for posting this Heatherly!

I found it SO HELPFUL to prepare everything & lay it all out the counter in sections before beginning to decorate.  Saved so much trouble of trying to stick my messy hand that would occasionally touch icing into a bag of candy!  I also used regular black licorice; HOWEVER, they do NOT transfer easy if you're using one of those cupcake carriers to take them somewhere.  The legs get in the way, so you lose a lot of space & I cut the licorice super short! :) SO... I made half spider cupcakes & then half the bat cupcakes (from this site).  That way, there was only a spider cupcake every other space which made it easier to stick them in whatever pan you have.  The skinny licorice stuck on the sides of the cupcakes instead of on top did help them stay on longer.  Try the bat cupcakes b/c they're equally cute!  I like the idea of just using black piping to create the full long leg look too.  I mean...who likes to eat black licorice anyway?  Oh wait, my husband ...but most people don't ;)  Have fun with these and use different colored icing or even try a cupcake recipe (on this site) that has something gooey in the middle like peanut butter.  They can be guts of the spider

This recipe was very fun to make with my granddaughter.  I used the black vines and cut in thirds, then cut those thirds lengthwise. They legslooked hairy and as a bonus you get 6 legs out of one vine!

I love the idea for the cupcakes.  Another good one you young ladies might try is meatballs set in a glass dish of deep red tomato sauce (I'd added red food color).  Use carrot or pickle strips for legs, olive slices for eyes. etc.  Place them in a long narrow dish with parsley sprigs for trees and bushes. I'm 75 and when my husband was alive, we came up with all kinds of crazy stuff. Friends would drop by just to see what we'd thought up.  They really liked our big fat "bugs". Would love to be able to do that stuff again. I think my daughter in  Washougal, WA. got the urge.

Excellent & fun to make.  I bought all my ingredients for the toppings at the bulk barn.  (Black shoestring licorice sold there also - prepackaged) The licorice pieces can be inserted right into the sides of the iced cupcakes to ensure the 'legs' won't fall off.

These were so fun to make and my daughter's pre-k class LOVED them!  I was able to find the black twizzlers at CVS, but they were way too heavy.  So instead I used pretzel sticks for the legs!! They were sooo cute! Thanks for such a cute idea!

I made these cute little cupcakes for my Church's Halloween party. Everyone loved them and gobbled them up. For the icing I just made a basic buttercream frosting and used food coloring to make it orange. It worked well and they were a hit.
Thank you for posting them :)

Very cute idea. I also could not find black shoe string licorice. The red kind worked well and matched the eyes.  I liked that much better.

Made these for my neice for her birthday party. I couldn't find any black shoestring licorice also. We got regular black licorice and just cut them in half lengthwise. They were a huge hit at the birthday party.

I also could not find black shoestring licorice. I used the rainbow colored mini Twizzlers and cut each strip in half (long way) to make them thinner. The kids actually loved being able to choose their own colored legs. I used mini M&Ms for the eyes and added chocolate sprinkles on the back to look hairy. I also used the caramel apple candy corn for fangs since they are red and white at the bottom. I put the brown part straight into the cupcake to stick and all you saw was the red and white part, looking like bloody fangs. The kids LOVED these! We ended up making them for all the neighborhood kids for Halloween. Very cute!

The were really fun to make and my girls (and the neighbors) loved them!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used the peel and twist twizzlers, instead of trying to find black licorice.  Thanks for the recipe!

they were good but I didn't use the shoe string licorice I used just orignal licorice but if I used either licorice it would take you a long time to put  on the licorice. So I give it three stars.***

Great idea! Thanks. I would strongly suggest following the recipe and refrain from using pipe cleaner. Pipe cleaners are NOT food safe- lead is more than likely present and is not an ideal substance to feed children. Not scolding... simply bringing it to your attention in case you were unaware. :)

These were so easy and cute.  I couldn't find black licorice but found grape which was pretty dark at No Frills.  Also I put in red or black jelly beans for the eyes and no orange sugar.  A success for my daughters kindergarten party I am sure!

I made this using the Too Much Chocolate Cake from this site and everyone loved these.  They were adorable.  I made spiders and cats.  The hard part was getting them to work.  They kept sliding together and I had to fix them when I got to work.

Loved these! Very simple to make. They do take some time so be prepared. I put the icing on first and then followed another comment and stuck the string twizzlers inside the cupcake (I used an ice pick to create the hole) so that they would stick. Then added the eyes and fangs. I topped with chocolate sprinkles to add the "hair" look. Everyone thought they were great!!!

This is an adorable cupcake.  I went to 4 different stores to find black shoestring licorice, and I could not find it anywhere.  So I used red licorice instead.

Ok, we had fun with this one for my sons Halloween party and they were a big hit! As another member said, we were unable to find the licorice so improvised with non-edible black pipe cleaners. Very creative and fun project!

I used chocolate cupcakes and chocolate frosting.  I couldn't find black shoestring licorice, so I used pretzel sticks for legs, which worked OK, but the pretzels got soggy after being refrigerated for a little bit.  We also made a "kitty cat" version by rearranging the decorations.  Fun to make with the kids - my 3 and 5 year old had a blast!

Made these for a Halloween party and couldn't be happier with the results.  Easy to make and went together quickly.  Was able to find supplies at the local cake decor shop and had no trouble putting everything together.  I did not use candy corn or cinnamon hots - just M & Ms.  Worked great!

i found black licorice at A.C. Moore; Wilton the cake/candy decorating company sells it.  Also I have a similar recipe but die the icing green and put licoricie in for legs and put an oreo on top of that; then take some tinted green icing and put 2 dots on the cookie and put green M&M's on the icing to make it look like eyes; you can use the red licorice too if you can't find the black but stores that sell Wilton products would have it in the seasonal display section. also I got package of sprinkles shaped like bats, witches hats and candy eyes could use too; would not use Red Hots as kids don't like them and neither do many adults.

These were a hit at the Halloween party we went to. Looked great on the tray with the other cupcakes we decorated. I added a dark chocolate kiss in the center of each cupcakes before baking.

Love the idea, especially as a licorice fan.  As for finding blank shoestring licorice, a quick Google search shows a number of online 'nostalgia' merchants selling it.  Plan ahead!

I recently made these cute cupcakes for a party and they were such a hit.  I made them with chocolate cake mix, chocolate icing, chocolate sprinkles, red hots for eyes, and black licorice for legs.  So easy!

loved these! they turned out wicked cute! i used both red licorice on some and red shoe string licorice for the others. I used choc frosting and choc sprinkles on top. The cinnamon eyes were adorable w/the candy corn fangs. I made one at a time so the frosting wouldn't harden. My high school students still loved these! Easy to make. Will be my new tradition!

I used red pull apart licorice for the legs (it helps to use a toothpick to poke it down into the cake), and slices of marshmallow and m&ms for the eyes. Everybody loved them.  Next year i'm gonna add cherry pie filling in the middle for some blood and guts! WAAAAHAHAHAHA!

Hi everyone, made this for my 5year old twins' Halloween Party and it was a huge success!  The kids loved them!  I used thin licorish all in different colours and used chocolate icing instead and they still loved them!!

I just made these for my sons 2nd grade Halloween party. The kids loved them! I coudnt find thin black licorice either. I used choc. frosting, choc. sprinkles (to look fuzzy) and I used choc. flavored twizzlers. I used one twizzler for each cup cake. I cut it in half and then quartered each piece to make 8 legs. Worked great.

I'm rating the CONCEPT of this recipe 5 stars.  I used my own cake recipe and the "Chocolate Frosting I" from this site.  After baking, I dipped the cupcakes in the frosting, added 2 red hots for eyes and then dipped in chocolate sprinkles.  I made several without legs and only a few with legs (the legs were messy).  I couldn't find black rope licorice, so I used rainbow colored Twizzlers.  I sliced them into two equal portions and then slit each portion lengthwise (1 Twizzler = 4 legs).  I shoved 6 legs into the cupcakes after I had put on the eyes & sprinkles.  I brought these to our "October Birthday Celebration" at work.  Thanks for the great idea!

Love love love this recipe!  It was so much fun to make as well as eat.  It was a hit with my niece as well as my co workers.  The only adjustment I made on it was I used Chocolate Twizzlers for the legs and cut them in half to make them thin and Reese's Pieces for the eyes.  Delish!

I used this recipe more as a jumping off point.  I used a different chocolate cupcake recipe (don't have and didn't want to buy a mix), so I just used the decorating ideas.  These really aren't too hard, but I couldn't find black licorice and so cut up tootsie rolls in order to make the legs.  I liked it that way, with brown legs, but I really didn't like the effort that took.  It's difficult to cut tootsie rolls!  I used scissors, but the issue is the thickness and the candy sticks to the scissors.  At any rate, I also used white frosting but used cocoa powder and food coloring to make it more brown.  I didn't have orange sprinkles, and I really wanted to use brown sprinkles but couldn't find them.  All in all, if i can find black licorice next time I'll use it.  Thanks for the idea!

Very cute idea for halloween. I used chocolate twizzlers w/chocolate icing and sprinkles (sprinkles for a hairy effect). I found no problem in getting the licorice to stick (then again I made chocolate banana muffins) 1 package of brownie w/choc. syrup mix and 1 banana + (water, eggs, oil etc.) and bake for 30 mins.  Delicious!  I wanted to submit a pic, but my digi cam died gggrrr!

The spider cup cakes were great I made a bunch and sent them to work with my husband to share and my kids even though they are teenagers thought they were really cool, I too had a hard time with black licorice and found black twizlers but they are real stiff and I ended up with shorter legs than I liked.. but this is a very cute recipe

What an absolute fun recipe for kids.  We used M&Ms for eyes because we couldnt find red hots anywhere!  We also used twizzlers twist and pull for the legs.
The autumn colored M&Ms available now are great for this recipe.

These were a hugh hit with my daughters Pre School classes Halloween party. I used pipecleaners in place of the legs and used a white cake mix and chocolate frosting. The kids kept calling them "trantualas". Thanks for the cute idea!

The taste was fine and they were cute with candy eyes and no fangs (too scary for a lot of kids and that's how they are in the posted picture).  The biggest issue we had was with the legs.  We tried multiple things, licorice as called for, Twizzlers, reinforced with toothpicks Twizzlers- nothing worked to keep them at an angle.  We finally had to opt for pipe cleaners.  They worked well but it would have been better with an edible item.

We used a different cupcake recipe but we're inspired by spider decoration. Kids did it all themselves and had a blast

They came out great!  I used rainbow Twizzlers and they were really cute.  The kids decorated them themselves.
