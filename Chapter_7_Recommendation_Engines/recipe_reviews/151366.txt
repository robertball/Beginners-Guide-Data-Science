These little gems are not Cafe Du Mond quality but darn close.  I think the dough is missing a little something.  I think I might try adding some vanilla or almond extract on my next go around.  A couple of modifications I made to this recipe was to use peanut oil rather than the vegtable oil and for the topping, add a little cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice to the powdered sugar.  I highly recommend giving it a try!

This took a bit of trial and error to get right. The oil on medium high is way to hot and the beignets just burned. My perfect temp was medium low. Dont cook more than 2 - 3 inch squares or 4 triangles at a time or it will lower the temp of the oil to the point that they will not puff up. When cooked properly they will first sink then puff up and float, then turn golden, if they start to spot your oil temp is to high. When I finally got the temp right they seemed a bit bland so I added brown sugar and cinnamon in my next dough ball and rolled it out so it had a marbled effect (this is so the way to go and I will continue to do that). If you put your paper towel and cooling racks on a cookie sheet you will be able to powder them there too and clean up will be a breeze. I made 3/4 of a batch and froze the rest. My 3 kids consumed them all only letting my husband and I snag 2 a piece so I will make a whole batch next time. Please also note that if you use the packets of yeast that it is only equivalent to 2 1/4 tsps and that would make your beignets not puff up as much.

This recipie makes a massive amount of Beignets!  I refrigerated the dough and made a batch for breakfast a few days in a row!  Just like New Orleans!

Just a warning - clean up immediatly - the dough is like cement when it dries!

Yummy Yummy beignets. Haven't tasted the real thing from Cafe Du Monde, but judging from the outcome of these yummy delights I can imagine what the real taste must taste like :) Also what I did was to eat them with sardine in tomato sauce. Tips when frying: Make sure the oil is not TOO hot or the inside won't cook and the outside would browned too much. Always flip them over and over again to get even colors on both sides. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

oh my goodness oh my goodness!!!  I was craving donuts so badly and decided this was the recipe for me.  So glad that I did!  I have never had the "real" ones but if they taste this good...they would be awesome.  Huge recipe but good if you can take them to work or have a hungry family!  Next time I will try filling them with some vanilla pudding and drizzling with some choc syrup for a nice presentation.

These brought me back to my honeymoon in New Orleans! So light, melt-in-your-mouth delicious. They're good the first day, but AMAZING right out of the pan. I agree that this recipe makes a TON-- next time I'll cut it in half at least. I didn't have shortening so I used butter, and I didn't have evaporated milk so I used water and "coffee whitener" (that creamer powder). I also added in about a tsp of vanilla as someone else suggested. I was concerned at first about rolling out the dough so thin, but it puffed up a huge amount while being fried. To dust with powdered sugar, I lined a tupperware container with paper towels, put in some of the fresh beignets and powdered sugar, and shook the whole thing. It worked beautifully and was a great way to transport as well. These will be a new chanukah tradition in our family!

Very good! The full recipe made 52 beignets (not all exactly the same size)! I think I'll try half a recipe next time.

It's a great recipe. I walked within a half-block of Cafue Du Monde a few years ago, but I couldn't convince anyone to go there. So I have nothing for comparison.

I wanted to give it four stars only because I'm not sure it's significantly different than any other fried dough recipe. In fact, it reminds me of the corn nuggets at Sonny's BBQ. But this dough recipe is a little less  sweet. 

Also, I'd like a little more. For example, I plan to mix up a chocolate mousse next time and use a piping bag to squirt some mousse inside the beignets.

The best part of the recipe is that the dough could be used for much more. I think it might work for Jamaican beef. Given its utility, I decided to give it a full five stars. But I'd like to see what people can do by combining this recipe with another on the site.

These are excellent and can be frozen! I followed the recipe exactly except I cut it in half. This still made a ton and I had no choice but to try freezing them. I made sure they were cool and I did not add the confectioners sugar to the ones I was going to freeze. I thawed them in the microwave on med power for 30 second intervals and then shook them in the bag of sugar. They were perfect - just like the day I made them!

I found this exact recipe elsewhere on the internet. I looked on here for Beignets and came across this. I love these alot! My entire family loved them. I want to add a cream cheese filling into them next time I make them.

Made it three times. First using butter instead of shortening, next adding cinnamon and brown sugar, then finally, as written.  Third time's the charm!  Before rating a recipe, PLEASE TRY IT AS OFFERED!  Lots of nostalgia behind these.  Thanx for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out beautifully!  Served them Christmas morning and my husband said he liked mine BETTER than the ones at Cafe du Monde! These are going to be an annual tradition in our family for Christmas from now on.  The recipe as written makes a LOT of dough- I divided it into four balls and froze three and baked one into the beignets.  The next week I thawed another ball of dough and rolled it out and made more beignets and they were as good as the first ones!  The dough freezes beautifully.  Just thaw for a few hours at room temperature in the plastic bag.

These were awesome! I am a fan of using my breadmaker so I mixed the sugar, shortening (except I used margarine instead because I was out of shortening), boiled water, etc... and the extra water you are supposed to dissolve the yeast in all together and then the flour on top and the yeast on top of that and set my breadmaker on the dough cycle. When it had 30 minutes left I popped the dough in the fridge for the last 30mins. They came out to be perfect little pillows of deliciousness!

Delicious. I am a private chef and had these requested by a client...They turned out amazing. Very tasty, and airy. I actually let the dough sit in the fridge overnight and punched it down once. I took the advice of others and added vanilla bean. As another reviewer mentioned, make sure you use the right amount of yeast. The recipe calls for a tablespoon, and one packet of dry yeast in only 2.25 teaspoons. 

I also froze a bunch of cut out beignets and put them in layers on parchment paper. I cooked them up this morning and turned out just as good as the first time. Thanks for the great recipe.

I make this recipe and after rolling and cutting the dough I freeze half the dough squares.  Just stack them with a little flour and wax paper between.  When I need tham I put them in the fridge the night before and fry the next day.  Works perfect for holiday time!  Delicious recipe, my kids love tehm dipped in chocolate sauce!

this is a great recipe and we think it is just like the cafe' Dumonde in New Orleans...  we had them years ago and this is the first try making them at home  Im so glad I chose this recipe... A few tips: I used my deep fryer, that way my oil stayed the right temp and I never had to cool down the pan and readjust the heat. I also used a pie cutter with a rippled edge to cut the diamond shapes and that gave them a very pretty edging. The only problem with these Beignets is you can not stop eating them.  they are well worth trying. I was going to mix up half the recipe but I'm glad I went with the whole thing because the dough stores well and you can have them whenever you want them . very very YUMMY!   I think you could squeeze some grape or raspberry jelly, even vanilla cream filling in the middle for a different twist and make a delicious jelly, or cream  filled doughnut, maybe ill try that next time for a whole new spin on these already delish treats.

ive made these a few times now, and theyre delicious!

i dont have much experience with yeast yet, so figuring out that bit was tricky.

if the yeast doesnt get foamy in the bowl, throw it out and try another.

ive found these fluff up and taste best after sitting in the fridge overnight, but if youre impatient (like me!) they fluff up alot more if you cut them out and let them "rest" for 10 minutes under a damp towel.

If memory serves me well these are as good as Cafe Du Monde. The recipe is easy to follow & I like it as is. It really does make a lot. Will halve the recipe next time. Thanks for sharing.

LOVE this recipe! I wanted to make homemade doughnuts and this was the first one I tried. I didn't have evaporated milk so I used fresh whole milk and they still turned out perfectly. Looks like my search is over already. Now I just have to find the perfect custard to squeeze inside and I'll never have to buy doughnuts again. Thanks for sharing!

Yes, these are very good. They remind me of Sopaipillas the way they puff up. In fact I did eat them with honey. I made these when I lived in Grants, NM. I do love the taste of these. I followed your reciepe and they turned out great.

This is a really good recipe.  I only have two tips:  1) I added 1 tsp. almond extract to the recipe to give it that little something it is missing (you can't taste the almond in the finished product) and 2) I suggest you use cottonseed oil as first choice, and the either sunflower oil, safflower oil or peanut oil as other choices.  Cafe DuMonde uses cottonseed oil.  I've been working on perfecting beginets for a while now and tweaking these things makes them nearly perfect.

Thoroughly enjoyed making AND eating these :) I was in the mood for cinnamon so I added that to the batter and then dusted some with powdered sugar and some with cinnamon and sugar mixed. Very good! Makes a TON so I made three ziploc bags with twenty a piece in them to give to the neighbors. We still have a lot left! 
Oh, the directions don't say to flip them while they're cooking but I did to get an even cooking on each side.

They call them Doughnuts and Beignets, I call them sopapillas ( I hope that is spelled correctly). I added vanilla and I think next time I will add a little more sugar. I also put cinnamon in my powdered sugar. I think the servings must be a mistake. I halved the recipe and still ended up with 2 dozen.

I have to say that I've never had a beignet prior to this evening, although I've made lots of standard doughnuts before.  I found the texture to be really, really lovely but the flavour was seriously lacking.  I would highly recommend using butter instead of shortening and also adding perhaps a little vanilla.  Will perhaps make again but not without a few adjustments.

We had some that we followed the recipe to a T and they were delicious.  Then we decided to get a little creative and we mixed up a bowl of chocolate icing and coolwhip and used a pastry bag to fill these before sprinkling on the powdered sugar and they were outstanding.  Made a room full of teenagers quit talking cause they tasted so good.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I'm not a 'sweets' person so I can't say if these are better than the average donut or sopapilla.  BUT I love to cook and I like this recipe because it allows me to be creative with the shapes and toppings.   ....I made mine small and dusted them with powdered sugar and then dipped into chocolate sauce.

I am anxious to try this recipe. My husband and I went to New Orleans on our honeymoon and Cafe Du Monde was a highlight of the trip. I did read on the CDM site that they suggest frying in cotton seed oil like they do. I saw some people thought something was missing. Perhaps that is it.

I have yet to try beignets, but this was a great basic recipe for fried dough since it tasted just like it. After cutting into squares, I allowed the dough to rise for at least an hour before frying. I recommend frying on a low heat and adjusting as necessary. The first piece burned almost instantly on medium heat. I will make these again with the exception of letting the dough rise to see if the inside is less airy.

I needed something for a New Year's Eve party and chose this recipe. I made the recipe and then did a test fry of 8 or 10 beignets and they were delicious. My concern was would they be as good cold versus warm, but I went ahead. I made the entire batch, which was a large quantity, but not for a party. I let them cool completely and then layered them on my serving tray and sprinkled them with confectioner's sugar before adding the second layer. Because they were drained and cool, they didn't absorb the sugar and looked wonderful. One great surprise was that by the time we got to the party and placed them out on the table, they had actually softened and were quite delicious! They were a hit and I got a lot of complements. Thank you.   One think I found though is that if you keep your oil at or around 360 degrees, about a minute and a half per side was perfect. Don't let them cook too long. There is a point where the quality begins to diminish the longer you cook them. Go for a very light brown. Thank you!

This recipe is really great! I LOVE the beignets at Cafe Du Monde so I was really looking forward to having something similar.  Everyone loved these! I'm not sure what it's missing, but it still does not taste as wonderful as Cafe's. Nonetheless, I will definitely make these again.   ** I would definitely let the dough rise for at least 6 hours.  It will come out much better!  I also added a tsp of vanilla **

Fantastically awesome and really easy! I was intimidated as I'd never worked with yeast dough, but these turned out great, I might add 1 T of vanilla next time. I had a friend and her kids over for beignets and coffee and the kids scarfed them up! I rolled out the leftover dough (this resipe makes a ton), cut it up and froze it so we can have beignets again.  I will definitely make these again!

I recently visited the famous cafe in New Orleans. They were one of the best things I have ever tasted. 
Well I was very proud of myself. Mine turned out great. They were so good, my friends were fighting over them. Thank you for the delicious recipe.

These were awesome and they make a lot! Yay, more for me and guests! I did add vanilla as others suggested. The only other change was that I let it rise after cutting and before frying. This allowed them to puff up even better and get nice and soft. So those that might have had bricks, that might have been the reason. I keep a stash now in the freezer in case company pops in unannounced.

Excellent recipe!  The only thing I changed, was I added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract as others had suggested (I only made 1/2 the recipe)because it does make a ton and it is soo easy.  I made the dough in the morning and cooked them after dinner.  Super fun for the kids to shake in sugar!  We dipped some in melted milk chocolate and plan to experiment with filling them next time!  Thank you for sharing this fun doughnut recipe!  :)

This recipe is wonderful as is though I may try adding some almond extract next time to see if that adds anything to it. It is very easy to make and because it makes so much I divided the batch to make over a couple of days, refrigerating the unmade. I actually piped some lemon curd into some and some Nutella into the others and they were a tremendous hit! So good, I'm not sure which I like better! This recipe is a keeper for sure.

4.5 rating.  My 4 young kids gobbled them up.  I sprinkled them with cinnamon/powdered sugar mixture and served them hot.  I thought they were good, but feel the dough is lacking in a little flavor.  Better to start lower/medium with oil temperature and work up - you'll have plenty of dough to experiment with.  My first one got super brown right away, then had a gooey inside.

i made these in a deep fryer in extra vir oliv oil. they have great taste  and were well enjoyed. the dough is easy to work with and would work well with any bread recipe. i may use this as a pizza crest next. the key is to use a good quality confection sugar at the end.

These turned out awesome! Neighbors LOVED them! My hubby isn't much of a pastry person but he LOVED them and brought a bunch to the shop.  I wish I would have read teh reviews before hand about the massive amount this recipe makes!  I made a small modification:  I used 4 cups all-purpose whole wheat flour (sifted 2x) then used 3 1/2 cups white all-purpose flour sifted WITH the whole wheat (making it 3x the wheat was sifted).  This makes the wheat light and fluffy instead of hard and heavy after cooking.  Because I used whole wheat, I also added a little room temp. water to the batter as I added the flour.  Just enough to make it more moist.  I had trouble with not keeping the oil at the right temp.  It would get TOO hot and then get too cool. I had a few that didn't expand but stayed flat.  Not sure if this was because of the oil or because I used wheat.  Other than that, they were SO GOOD!

This was a great recipe.  Only thing was I didn't have shortening so I used butter.  I only did half of the recipe and only fried half of the dough which was a lot for my husband and I.  Very yummy and very similiar to the real thing - even my husband enjoyed them!

I'm only giving this treat 3 stars. There is definitely something missing. I added a lot of sugar to make it taste sweet. Don't think I'll be sleeping tonight.  I'm sure my boys will enjoy it tomorrow morning and it will probably keep them going for the entire day. =(

They are ok.  I was looking for a recipe similar to my mother in law's, but these just don't compare.  Hers are much fluffier and have more flavor.

Yum! perfect easy donut substitute. I did have problems keeping the oil the right temp; it started too hot and they browned too fast without puffing up. Better to err on the side of too cold and let them cook a bit longer. The dough is so easy to make, but it does make a ton! I cut the recipe in half, and one baseball-sized amount made about 18, which was enough for the 6 adults+2 kids brunch I brought them to. I thought they were great as is, but I can see how adding on cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice could make it even better!

The sopapillas I've had at several places are much crunchier than beignets & doughnuts are different, as well. I prefer the beignets & this is a great recipe! It can take some practice to fry them just right, but it's worth it! And my family likes them just with the powdered sugar...... no cinnamon, nothing else...... except maybe a glass of cold milk or a cup of hot coffee!

These are wonderful! It does make a lot...but you don't have to fry them all up. Keep in fridge and can easily make fresh ones in the morning! :D Did not change a thing!

Great recipe - followed it to the letter, but I found the dough too soft to keep my shapes consistent, when putting the in the deep fryer. Other than that, they were a big hit at the 'Nawlins themed baby shower.  I will be making these again in the near future.  This is a very easy recipe.

I grew up in Baton Rouge, LA and use to eat beignets all the time as a child but never knew how to make them. I made this recipe for my family and didn't change a thing! Not only did my family love them but they tasted just as i remembered them. We had so much dough left the next morning I rolled out biscuits that we ate with molasses syrup. Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty and simple dough. making the whole batch was somewhat time consuming but well worth it. We used a cinnamon-sugar sprinkling instead of powdered sugar. This recipe made enough beignets for about 12 people. definitely a keeper.

I tried this recipe on a whim and am SO glad I did.  I have never tried beignets before, so I have no frame of reference, but these were fantastic.  I did notice that the dough was a little bland, so I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of almond extract and it worked wonderfully. I also cooked them in a fryer on the back porch, I found that the summer heat helped them to rise slightly before I put them into the fryer.  They puff much better when they are allowed to rise.

These taste exactly like Cafe Du Monde!  Had a lot of visitors the day I made these and everyone LOVED them!  This recipe makes a lot so I froze the rest in layers between sheets of wax paper in a ziploc bag.  Experimented with thawing out a few and then frying them to see if the taste was the same.  It was the same!  I am thrilled that we can have these whenever we want!

Good, puffy doughnut. They aren't too sweet on their own, which I like. We covered some in powdered sugar, some in cinnamon-sugar, and cut a few of the puffier ones open and put a little jelly in them...MMMM!

I practically grew up in New Orleans and have had the beignets at Cafe du Monde more times than I can count. These didn't puff up as much as they should have and had a doughy taste in my opinion.  My friends all liked them, but I guess knowing how good the real thing is kind of ruined it for me.  Next time I attempt to make these (or Elephant Ears which are pretty much the same, just a different shape), I'm going to save myself some time and effort and buy frozen bread dough, roll it out, cut it and fry it.

Best beignets I've ever made.  Very light, yet crispy on the outside.  I fried half the dough the first day and sprinkled powdered sugar on them.  Then I put the leftover dough in a ziplock bag in the frig.  The next day, I let the dough come to room temperature and fried them, using as a dipper for fondue.  I'll be using this as my go to recipe.  Thanks!

I made this yesterday and stupidly used all the flour, it made so much. I will make these again but make only 1/4 of the recipe. They were very good when you eat them right away...not so much the next day.

Maybe the missing "something" was my not using evap milk but I'm not a fan so I subbed half and half. We ate some fresh and hot, the  leftovers went in the bin. Scaled to half so I had about 2/3 of the dough left. Next day I patted it out and let it rise, dimpled then dusted with herbes de provence. Baked then drizzled with garlic butter, made a tasty focaccia style garlic bread to go with spicy lasagna. Since it's slightly sweet, a bit like  Hawaiian bread, it would be good to make a large Schlotzsky's size sammy  with  this>>> "Baked Hawaiian Sandwiches".

This recipe is great! I love that it is a family recipe and others who left reviews are incorporating it into their traditions as well. Someone can roll out the dough, someone can fry, and someone can sugar them. They tasted excellent! I only had to adjust the frying temperature for my pan, since I used cast iron. I fried around 330-340 degrees F. I will remember this recipe for the future.

I made these for my family and they were a hit.  The first time i made them they were not that sweet so the second time i made them, i used 1 cup of sugar and they were sweet enough that they didnt even need the dusted powdered sugar. I also didnt have evaporated milk so i used regular whole milk which turned out fine.  Also, the second time i made them i used coconut milk instead which gave them a nice coco-nutty taste.  The original recipe makes alot of beignets so i used half the dough and froze the other half for later use, although i ended up making them again the very next day because my kids ate them all up and kept asking for more.

My family and I love these!! I love how many I can get out of the recipe too (just have to keep my brothers away from them lol)
Only problem was with the frying- for anyone trying this kind of cooking the first time, it's really easy to burn the oil if you aren't paying attention, and it's better to have two people working at that point in the kitchen. Just make sure you don't burn each other!! Wear oven mitts to protect yourselves!

I had never had these before- always been curious since I saw Disney's Princess and the Frog. These are really good! Way too easy to eat though... but relatively easy to make too. This recipe is huge. I halved the recipe as is, only made them from about a third of the dough and it's SO many beignets! Oh, and I added a teaspoon of vanilla with the egg, as another reviewer suggested.

These are very good! I'd never made doughnuts and wanted to make some for Fat Tuesday/Doughnut Day so I tried these. I followed the recipe to the letter. The dough seemed really sticky and soft while I was making it so I did add a little bit more flour. It rose a lot in the fridge. I was busy with something else, so mine rose for 2 hrs instead of 1. I used a deep fryer so I wouldn't have to worry so much about temperature control. They really puffed up in the hot oil! I loved watching them puff! I knew from the amount of flour called for that this would make a lot of donuts, but man o man! We're giving them away to practically everyone we know! They are quite tasty. Close to Cafe Du Monde, at least as close as I'll get in my attempts.

This is my first time trying it and I thought it turned out great! I didn't have the required pan so I used a normal deep pot to heat the grease in, in which it required a low-medium heat because it nearly burned them at first. I agree with the other person saying the recipe needs a little vanilla and possibly a little bit more sugar. Other than that it was successful (im an awful cook) and taste great! :)

Awesome goodness is all I can say. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I just followed the recipe and added cinnamon powder together with the confectioner sugar in a ziploc bag for dusting.

Went to the famous Cafe Dumonde a few weeks ago and had the real deal, delicious! So I tried this recipe to duplicate, my husband said they looked and tasted very similar. Recipe was very simple and easy to follow.

Awesome fresh. (Once cooked, not good saved in a baggie.) Kids had fun shaking the sugar on. A nice weekend treat.

this was my first attempt at deep frying anything, so maybe that was the problem?  My beignets did not come out puffy.  I even tried rolling & let them sit for an hour before frying & still didn't puff up like I wanted.  They still tasted good, mostly like a funnel cake.  I did notice the yeast seemed to expand in my stomach after eating these.  Great recipe to try for Mardi Gras but probably won't be a repeat w/ us.

these were very good!  I only made a half batch though cause this makes way to many for my little family of 3.  I still had so many that I packed 3 quart bags full and sent my husband off to his mom's with them.  She had 3 teenage boys and couple men at her house at the time and they chowed these things down and begged for more.  heh, i guess i know what I'm making this weekend.

My 14-yr old son is the gourmet at our house.  After trying beignets at Disneyland, he used this recipe to make them for us.  Wow!  Quickly becoming a family favorite.

We had beignets at the Grand Lux Cafe in downtown Chicago - and this recipe was our attempt to recreate that awesome experience.  They are FANTASTIC!  There were 6 of us at the table, and we were floored how many this recipe made - each one of us shaking our head "we'll never eat all those". Within 20 minutes, every single one was gone! We served them with 3 sauce options - a white frosting dipping sauce, chocolate fondue sauce, and raspberry sauce. Made the recipe exactly as its written - and we'll do it again this year -- GREAT!!

very yummy, but cafe du monde will always have one up because they have a secret ingredient - cotton seed oil!  you really can't find it anywhere, and if definietly gives it that extra something.  These come pretty close though

My boyfriend is from New Orleans area, and has had Cafe Du Monde beignets several times. He absolutely loved this! He said it tastes very close to that recipe and all he needed was some cafe au lait and life would be very good! As is the recipe makes a TON of dough so if you are only looking for a few beignets, use the recipe adjuster to make less. Really very good!

I followed the recipe to a "t" with  no changes. I had the originals at Cafe Du Monde and felt 
like I was there enjoying them!!! A great tip that works: make the batch and keep it in the fridge to make later-so easy to roll, cut and fry! Can also freeze in batches for later. Worth it!!

I've yet to try the beignets from Cafe Du Monde, but I've made these for my mother-in-law and husband (who both have had the ones from NO) and they loved them. My Husband love that they weren't too sweet. We ate the first batch in minutes. 

I halfed the recipe and still had alot of dough left. I added a teaspoon of vanilla, tablespoon of baking powder, and went along with two eggs instead of one. They were so fluffy and so easy to cook. I'll try filling them with different types of stuffing just to experiment next time.

I halved the recipe, which was easy to do, and substituted a mix of whole milk and half & half for the condensed milk according to substitution directions I found online. Work great and my kids and friends gobbled up the entire batch!

Excellent dough. I stirred by hand it is IMPOSSIBLE to 7.5 cups of flour (I tried twice and the first batch was ruined). So I ended up using 6 cups and it was still delicious. I ended up cooking at 325º for a longer time until golden brown, supper fluffy inside! Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was so easy and it's results were TERRIFIC!
After making some of the dough up as the recipe directs, my daughter and I wanted a few with fruit filling.  We took even amounts of softened cream cheese and strawberry preserves and blended the two together. We then took one piece of the cut dough, dampened the edges, placed fruit mixture in the center and covered the dough with a second piece of the cut dough and pressed edges to seal.  Fry as previously directed, let cool and shake to cover with the powdered sugar just as with the typical beignets...yummy!

This recipe is amazing. I've made it five or six times, and it turns out great every time. Shortening can be substituted for oil, and I've found that you can use regular milk in place of evaporated, and there's not that much of a taste difference. My family's huge, and we always have enough for us and the neighbors! LOL

I have had MANY beignets from Cafe du Monde and these really hit the spot. I usually change something in every recipe but made these exactly (except for halving the recipe). They are the real deal--totally authentic and easy enough for a first timer.

I made these for brunch one weekend and man were they delicious! After reading the reviews I halved the recipe and it still made a massive amount of beignets! So I played around with them. I stuffed some with sweetened ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and jelly. We had fun with them and they were all delicious

These were really good! I did make the addition of 1 Tbsp vanilla and 1 Tbsp cinnamon to the dough, and it sat closer to 2 hours in the fridge. I also free-handed circles instead of rolling and cutting. Everyone really enjoyed them and said that they were fantastic, but would be even better filled! Will definitely reccommend adding the vanilla and cinnamon, or else this would have been a 2 star recipe for blandness. Very good recipe for my first ever doughnuts.

These beignets were good but a bit on the bland side.  I added some cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves to heighten the flavors.  It really needs something added.  The spices helped and I think I may make some kind of chocolate sauce or strawberry sauce for these to dip in.  The work that goes into these is a little much for someone who wants to find easy and fast recipes.  Luckily I have good time on my hands and understand some things are well worth the wait.  I had problems adding in the last bit of flour and it just wouldn't mix.  I added water to help and made a stiff dough.  If I make these again, I would add some spices right into the dough.

Update:  I made a chocolate sauce to put on these and they were a lot better!!!

We all liked them but we were not crazy about the fried heaviness.  A little went a long way.

This recipe is easy to follow and they turn out very well. I used star, heart, and fish cookie cutters to make them fun shapes, they all turned out well. I would agree that this recipe could use a little bit of vanilla or almond extract. Overall, these are easy and fun to make with kids.

My whole family, except for one, and their friends loved them!  As other reviewers said, they do make a lot, but as the author said you can store any unused dough in the refrigerator up to a week, I think.  Except for the powdered sugar, they weren't very sweet at all.  Next time, I think I will put a glaze on them or fill some of them with a buttercream or custard.  Then they'd be even yummier!

Delicious recipe! Absolutely worth the process to make them, because they are fa-bu-lous. My dough mixture was exceptionally sticky, and I would up adding more more flour. I paid attention to the advice  to use a paper bag to coat the beignets with sugar. Tasty!

Mine didnt puff that much but they did taste good. More like the fried dough you get at a fair vs. beignets in NOLA.

FANTASTIC!  Just like Cafe du Monde.  Made them for Superbowl Sunday in honor of the saints and all we could say was WOW!  Could cut recipe in half and still have a ton of dough and beignets.  Thank you, this is wonderful!

This is a nice basic recipe and its better to work with if you leave it overnight. This made a massive amount of dough--I would half it next time. I rolled out the dough and made heart shapes with a cookie cutter. I will add  a dash of nutmeg to the dough next time but added it to  cinnamon sugar roll mix and also used powdered as well for 2 different effects. These fried up extremely fast and cannot imagine 3 minutes let alone 5. Seems like they cooked in seconds.

I have never eaten these before so I have no comparison, but I do not need one! These taste heavenly!!!(Worth standing there for ever, it seemed, and frying them!) As other reviewers suggested, I added cinnamon to the icing sugar, which is just too yummy!

I am not usually a fan of frying or donuts in general but this recipe is delish! The thinner you roll these babies the better they puff up. The dough it sweet enough on its own that you definitly dont need a cup of confectioners suger. Yummy for a girlie brunch :)

Shape, size, and thickess of the dough after rolling and cutting makes a big difference in the "puff". Taste is like that of a good yeast doughnut. Once I got the variables right, the result is outstanding.  The (extended) family found powdered sugar, granulated sugar, honey, jam, even maple syrup to work on these. I used lard as the shortening and deep fried them in lard at 375F. Oil absorption is miminal during cooking.

Loved the recipe, donuts came out great! I really wanted donut balls so I used this recipe and YUMMY! I didn't have evaporated milk so I used regular milk and didn't have shortening so I used 1/4 cup of butter. Teach me to make things on a last notice!! But it was worth it...sooooo good, my man ate half the batch!!!

Delish! I wouldn't add vanilla. It should have a little nutmeg for a more authentic recipe. I normally use another recipe but you have to let it rest overnight and I needed it more quickly. I thought they were great and I forgot to add the nutmeg. My guests thought they were fantastic!

Never had these before and curiosity got the best of me!  I halved the recipe, as several reviews stated that this made a huge batch!  These are awesome, although I was expecting a little more sweetness in the dough.  Didn't have Evaporated milk, so used Whole milk instead...these are awesome...so awesome that I am going to make these for the family potatoe pancake breakfast...I was trying to figure out what to make and low and behold I have found it!

This is a great recipe. I had no idea what these things were but I thought I'd try them as I had a wild hair to make doughnuts and found this. I made them gluten free and they turned out great. I tried some baked for less fat (NOT a good idea) and I burned a few as I'm not yet oil smart. Overall, very delicious and I'm really happy they actually taste good gluten free! Thanks for sharing, this will definitely be a cherished recipe when I get the frying down right!

Really good!  We ate the first time and they were very light and fluffy then a couple of days later we fried up the rest of them (this recipe makes a LOT!) and they were a little more dense.  They were good both ways!

these were really good.  But were way too sticky to roll out and I was in a hurry. after a few failed attempts,  I basically fried them in globs i tore by hand from the batter. They were still really tasty once disguised with generous helpings of powdered sugar. Dusted some of them very lightly with cinnamon and used some maraschino cherries just to add a festive appearance-- made a great birthday breakfast for my sweetie, along with an ice caffe latte!

My son saw the Cafe Du Monde on TV and asked if we could make French market doughnuts at home.  As usual, we found the perfect recipe on this site.  I had lots of help from my two boys. They especially enjoyed using the sifter to dust the beignets with powdered sugar.  I think I'll add some vanilla next time.  We'd never tried beignets before, but we all agreed that they taste verymuch like funnel cake.  We will probably make these again sometime.

these were delicious!
i have made them 3 or 4 times and each time they came out wonderful.
for those of u who came out with rocks, it may be a problem w ur yeast. 
i recommend adding  a bit of vanilla or cinnamon into your dough, as it gives added flavor
these r great for breakfast with some jam
it makes quite a lot, so i love to make these for christmas parties, or get togethers

These were a success the FIRST time I made them:-) I followed recipe exactly except I added 1/2 tsp almond extract to dough. Read recipe before starting to be sure you have enough flour!  (I used about 6 1/4 cups).  Cut them in small triangles (size of index finger-max), and drop only 3 at a time in hot oil to be certain they don't get over-browned. (Be sure temp of oil is correct too).
 I tossed in a grocery paper bag when done and dumped 1 c. powdered sugar on top then shook closed bag.
I served with sliced strawberries + whipped cream in a dessert bowl with a Beignet on top. Classy and yummy !

These are delightful. I made half the recipe and still got a ton of them. Followed recipe exactly, did lower the oil temp about 5 degrees. They cook up fast and easy. I've never been to New Orleans so I can't compare, but I'm happy with these.

Added sprinkling of sugar to yeast mixture, didn't wait for liquids to cool all the way and added extra sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Waited for the yeast mixture for 10-15 minutes, let the dough rest for 1 hour in the fridge. 

Tested one in the fryer, when ready they should rise quickly and puff up very fast. We had to turn down the temperature because they were ready too fast. The perfect color for these seems to be a light golden brown. 6-8 seconds on each side in our fryer. After they were done we let them cool for a few seconds and then when they were cool enough to handle we dipped them in melted chocolate. They were delicious, and we are all very full. We will be making these again (and not just because there is a huge amount of dough left.)

I've used this recipe to see how it stood against my grandmother's recipe and have to say it holds up.  Next week I'll do a favorite here with the kids now crawfish (to you that are not from here crayfish) is coming into season making a crawfish etouffee with out rice and stuff into the beignet and top with more.  Or stuff the beignet with a crawfish crab mixture using polenta (grits) and top with the etouffee.

I   made these today. They came out so good, light and crispy. I read some of the reviews and some said that they weren't sweet enough, so I use cinnamon sugar in place of regular sugar. That gave a nice sweetness to the batter.  I will definitely be making these agains.  Thanks for this recipe.

I've made this recipe a few times, and I must say my entire family devours these. Normally I would have left it to rise only once, but I decided to let it rise twice in the bowl and once again after I had cut them. Allowing them to rise after I cut them made them more like donuts rather than have a hollow inside. They're also quite plain, which in turn, allows them to be complimented nicely with an accent of jam/jelly. They're bomb.

"Cheese and crackers!"  Theses are good!  It was a big hit with the family.  We, like so many families are Disney fans.  When we watched The Princess and the Frog, I picked up on the line by Charlotte, "I'm gonna need about five hundred of your man-catching beignets!"  I had to make them.

I don't deepfry much at home, but these beignets are worth the mess and trouble!  Light, yet moist, they practically melt in your mouth! For the powdered sugar coating, I added a couple of tablespoons of superfine sugar, which helped them stay crispy longer, and added a lovely fine crunch to them.

I love this recipe.  It is the most easiest dough I have worked with.  It has lightness & density all at the same time.  I have made these for large groups of Young Adults for Conferences and they just devour them.  Thank you for your post eternally grateful.

I have been searching for a good donut recipe lately and finally found this one.  Taste was great and with just a couple of tweaks it would put it over the top! I let my dough rise at room temperature and also let them rise after I cut them.  this way they were a little bigger but didn't use more dough.

I have made these several times now and they are a huge hit with friends and family! I always make the full batch, with only change being I use my electric deep fryer. My kids and husband fill up while I am cooking them, barely letting the cool. I take the rest to our neighbor's or the local fire station. Always get requests for more.

I made this for my family. Light and delicious.  Everyone loved it. It's real easy to 6 or 8 pieces without thinking.

I made a butter substitute on shortening. Also, I fried these beignets on canola oil. Make it thin if you want a bit of crunch from the outside. It's not exactly the same as Cafe Du Monde's beignets which is what I expected. I'm hesitant to use cottonseed oil because of it's high saturated fat content. Nevertheless, my hubby and kids loved it!

View Notes. 2nd try were GREAT!   Disappointed.  Too bready and dough lacked flavor.  Next time - 
* let dough set for 2 hours and not refrigerate, for fluffiness.
* gently bathe oil over the surface, then flip, only to golden brown.

I made the dough the day before frying.  I had trouble rolling the dough out to 1/8" and keeping it that way.  I struggled to get it that thin, then when I cut the beignets into diamonds the dough would shrink back up into 1/4" thick little blobs.  The beignets were still good, but I think they would have been less dense if I could have kept them at 1/8."
