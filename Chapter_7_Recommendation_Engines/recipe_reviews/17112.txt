I LOVE this recipe!  I don't think I'll ever make cookies from scratch again; plus there are so many variations that can be done with this.  A few that I have tried are: Coconut cake mix, with 1/2 cup shredded coconut, 1/2 cup macadamia nuts, and 1/2 cup chocolate chips; Lemon cake mix with 1 cup white chocolate chips; Strawberry cake mix with 1/2 cup shredded coconut and 3/4 cup white chocolate chips; Carrot cake mix with 2/3 cup oats and 1/2 cup raisins.  YUMMY!  I have so many more flavors to experiment with!  I did find that I had to bake them a bit longer than the recipe called for, about 11-12 minutes.  Try this one, you won't regret it!

Didn't have a yellow mix so instead used a devil's food.  Also used margarine.  I didn't press down, left them in balls, as I like a cakier, softer cookie.  These were delish!  They tasted like little brownies.  The only other mod. I used nuts and choc. chips, and M&M's to equal 1/2 cup total.  These were not sticky at all and were a snap to make, economical, and very uniform because the dough was beautiful to work with and easily made so with the help of a cookie scoop.  I only had an ALDI'S brand mix which is super cheepo and they still were wonderful.  Didn't taste like a mix at all.  Versatile recipe and so quick and easy, not to mention good-tasting.

My mother made these for my kids when she came to visit. She used a lemon cake mix and added a package of lemonade kool-aid and a Tbls. of lemon juice. These were sooooo good. I can't wait to try other variations.........    I just tried another concoction of a spice cake mix with craisins, raisins, and walnuts. So yummy!

I have been using this recipe for a few years now and just noticed that I have never reviewed it! This is my favorite recipe when I need to make some cookies in a pinch. I always have a cake mix, eggs, butter and oatmeal on hand, then I can add in whatever else is handy. We have done all sorts of combos using things like chocolate chips, toffee bits, coconut, raisins, nuts, white chocolate chips, etc. They are universally loved by everyone who has eaten one. I wouldn't say these are a top tier gourmet cookie, but they are  so darn tasty considering how incredibly quick and easy they are to make.

These are the best cookies I have ever made! I made these with some vanilla extract, chocolate chips and peanut butter chips. I flattened them a bit before putting them in the oven and baked them for only 8 minutes (they were just barely golden on top when I took them out). I will never make cookies from scratch again!

This batter goes together easily and quickly.  They would be great roll & bake, but I used my cookie scoop and flattened them a little because they don't spread much.  I substituted with a chocolate cake mix and peanut butter chips instead of nuts then sprinkled powder sugar after baking.  They were crispy and chewy in all the right places!

This recipe couldn't be easier!!!  I substituted white cake mix for pecan mix and added pecans instead of walnuts.  I also increased the baking time to 14 minutes because I used a baking stone instead of a cookie sheet.  More of our favorites include cherry cake mix with white coconut, chocolate mix with walnuts and golden mix with raisons.

I had some slightly outdated cake mixes that I wanted to use, and the first one was coconut cake.  Found this recipe, and made it according to the directions, replacing the yellow cake mix with coconut cake mix, omitting the walnuts (my kids don't like them) and adding 1/2 cup of shredded coconut and 3/4 cup of chocolate chips.  I baked them until they were just slightly browned.

They just came out of the oven and they are excellent!  They don't taste like other cake mix cookies I've made, which had a rather "off" flavor.  These taste like little candy bars (think Mounds) in a cookie form.  They are wonderful!  I know I'll be making these again.

Update: Made two more variations.  In the first I used Butter Recipe Golden cake mix, increased the oatmeal to 1 cup and added 3/4 cup butterscotch chips. They were wonderful!  The second variation used a lemon supreme cake mix, 1 cup oatmeal, 1/2 tsp. lemon juice and 3/4 cup white chocolate chips.  We really liked these also, but not as much as the other two.  Just a flavor preference.  Our very favorite are the coconut chocolate chip.

For all varieties, I used a small scoop and baked them rounded on the sheet, not flattened, and they cooked for about 11-12 minutes.  I think the oatmeal might be the ingredient that makes these not taste so much like cake.  I decide how much to add based on the stickiness of the batter, and add enough to make it more of a cookie dough, rather than a cake mix, consistency.

Doesn't taste anything like real cookies, but a good short-cut.  Something about yellow cake mix just doesn't taste right to me, I guess, even though the oats and walnuts were a good choice.  The good thing is this recipe is easy to change up, using the same measurements but various ingredients.  Tonight's sweet-tooth attack was handled by a spare box of vanilla cake mix, 1/2 cup sweetened coconut, 1/4 cup sliced almonds, 1 tsp almond extract, 1/4 cup oil, and a splash of milk.  The kidlet loved them and named them Puffy Clouds.  I still prefer the real thing.

This recipe is super easy and very little clean up.  However I read several other recipes just like this and made a few changes.   1st - use 1 1/4 cups of quick oats otherwise the batter and cookie are mushy.  2nd - add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, you may want to add more.  otherwise cookie just tastes like a piece of cake.  we don't like nuts so I made one batch as a sugar cookie and the other with chocolate chips.  I really liked them and so did my family but it is not the same as a regular chocolate chip cookie and that is why I  gave the recipe 4 stars.

These were outstanding!  I divided the dough into 4ths and stirred choc chips into one batch, raisins and cinnamon in another, butterscotch chips and cinnamon in another, and butterscotch chips, raisins and cinnamon in the last.... one was as good as the other, loved them all!  My only complaint with this recipe is the oatmeal gets a little lost in there, next time I may add more and a little more liquid to compensate (another egg maybe or a little water?)

After reading the reviews, instead of using nuts I added 3/4 tsp vanilla and 2/3 cup M&M's.  I used 1/8 cup scoop and made the cookies a little larger than usual.  When they were finished, they looked and tasted just like Mrs. Field's Butter Cookies with M&M's from the mall!  Both my teenagers rated them "incredible!" but I found them to be almost too sweet with a slight after taste.

Easy and tasty!  Crunchy yet chewy yet soft.  Left out the walnuts for the picky eaters, but still feel virtuous serving the oats in the yellow cake mix cookies.  Made them with my medium sized scoop and flattened with the bottom of a glass.  Perfect rounds!

Easy to make, VERY sticky dough, I didn't use the Walnuts. Cookies are kinda cake like in texture rather than cookie texture....Kids LOVED them.

I wasn't a big fan of these.  The texture was odd for a cookie, and I couldn't get them to look appealing - just looked like strange blobs of cake dough?

A great cookie when made at midnight to take to a grandchild in college.  I used the tiny M & M's and some pecans in the dough.  Crispy and delicious.  They were truly appreciated.

I had trouble with this recipie. It did not indicate the state the butter was supposed to be. melted, soft or what? Mine was soft but not room temperature so it didn't blend with the eggs. The dough was sticky and certainly not rollable.  I don't know what I did wrong. They tasted ok but not as easy to make as other cake mix cookies I have used.

Great recipe.  Very sweet.  I made the cookies using a yellow mix,  and added (with the eggs and butter) 1 mashed banana, a few T. of orange juice and 1/2 pkg. of butterscotch chips.  Cooked for 10 min. and they were a hit.  I'm calling them bananas foster cookies.

the recipe was super easy. I only had chocolate cake mix so I added chocolate chips instead of walnuts. The kids gobbled them up my only complaint is that the walnut sized ones we made came out a little dry and I like a soft fluffy cookie.

I was very hesitant to try these, having never made "cake mix" cookies and because i was concerned about the cakey texture.  WRONG!  They turned out excellent.  I skipped the nuts but did everything else as directed and they are very popular in my household.  They are crispy on the outside and a little softer on the inside, they look very nice and taste as though they are made "from scratch". Definitely a time saver and the only reason it's only getting 4 stars is cuz i feel guilty about cheating with the cake mix!!!  ;)

These were so easy and very tasty. For variation, I made one batch with raisins (boiled in rum) and oatmeal, and another batch with walnuts and chocolate chips. Thank you for the recipe!

Excellent!
Some things I tried / think might work better:

Pistachios in place of walnuts.

Chilling the dough, it is quite sticky otherwise.

Cooking for 12 minutes (untill well-browned), IMHO the browned/carmelized
part of the cookie is far better than the softer/fluffer bit you otherwise get on
top with a shorter cooking time.

A great tasting cookie, and extremely easy to make. I increased the oatmeal a bit, and used butterscotch chips instead of walnuts. The butterscotch chips made it a very sweet cookie! Other than being a little too sweet (which would be rectified by using nuts or chocolate chips instead) the cookies were great. They were chewy and moist, and didn't last long in my house with 4 kids around!

When I mixed it, it was really stiff, so I added 2 tbsp of maple syrup. I used pecans instead of walnuts because that's what I had. Yum-o. Great, easy recipe.

The BRAND of cake mix makes a HUGE difference! I have tried with various brands--store brands (cheaper) ones tend to be a dryer dough & easier to work with. Name brands (Pillsbury, Duncan Hines, Betty Crocker) seem to have a higher sugar ratio & tend to be more moist & chewy (also stickier to roll or scoop). Either way, still yummy!

These are easy to make with a good result. They did get eaten up fast at my house. I used my cookie scoop instead of rolling them in my hands. No nuts for us, chocolate chips instead.

This recipe was okay. I added chocolate chips to the mixture and omitted the nuts. Personally, I thought it tasted like a crispy cupcake. My son loved them but i wasn't a big fan.

These are super easy. They aren't really my favorite cookie but they are good. I like the addition of the oatmeal it adds a nice touch. We used m&m's instead of walnuts for use as a school snack for my sons birthday and everyone thought they were tasty. Worth a shot. Great way to use a cake mix that you haven't yet used up. I'm sure it would work with any flavor!!

I thought these turned out very good. The batter was very sticky but better after refrig. for a while. This is the best tasting cake mix cookie recipe that I have tried. I used pecans instead of walnuts and added a little vanilla. Good!

It was very quick and easy, but it seems to need something extra as it is rather bland. I made it without the nuts hoping it would be like an oatmeal cookie and that may have added to the blandness.  Over all an easy and good cookie.

This recipe is so versatile! I made them for my Meals on Wheels folks and dropped them in a two tablespoon heap. The Shut-in folks like things they can get their hands around! I used oil instead of butter, used a white cake mix, a sprinkle of Orange juice and orange flavored sprinkles. You could do ANYTHING with this recipe and it is so easy. The only problem is guessing how long to bake. I just watched mine carefully. A great recipe!

Instead of using oatmeal and walnuts, I added 1/2 bag of milk chocolate chips.  Also, used Funfetti Cake Mix since it was all I had at the time.  Super easy and the cookies were good too!  Tried this recipe over others listed due to using softened butter instead of oil.  Easy to customize with whatever you have in the pantry.  Very pleased.  Have already made these twice!

So easy and quick to make.  Grandkids loved them.  Easy to make variations by switching flavor of cake mix.  More & more of the cake mix companies have decreased the volume in the box.  So far it’s been ok

They taste wonderful.   I had to turn the oven temp down to 350 degrees.  375 was way too hot, so I burned the bottoms of the first tray.   Other then that.  they were great.  I will make them again.

Easiest cookie recipe ever! I made a version of red velvet, that I iced with cream cheese frosting and topped with conventional hearts for Valentine's day, and another version using a pineapple cake mix, coconut, a squirt of lemon juice, and a singles packet of pina colada (that you use to flavor water). I topped it with more coconut. I found that 9 minutes was the perfect length of time to bake them. Will definitely use this recipe again.

The two box cake mixes I had were smaller in ounces than the one listed in this recipe (one was Duncan Hines and the other was Betty Crocker) so I used both and used 3 eggs and 3/4 c coconut oil, added one t. vanilla and some mini chocolate chips.  I rolled the balls in sugar and flattened just a tad, then baked for 10 minutes and left them on the cookie sheet for a couple minutes to set.  They are fabulous!!!!

Absolutely the best cake mix recipe ever!  I needed something quick and easy.  The only thing I changed was not adding the walnuts and chocolate chips.  Instead I used a teaspoon or more of almond extract. My family went coo coo for more!!! A++

This was ok for me. Biggest issue I had with these was how dry they tasted. I did add a tsp. of vanilla but other than that followed recipe exactly. The oatmeal flavor gets totally lost and you cannot taste it at all. I also added a cup or so of raisins. My husband loved them and normally I adore cake mix cookies but this one didn't do it for me.

I used 1/3 cup butter instead of 1/2 then added about a tablespoon of water.  I also added raisins to the mix then shaped them into golfball sized balls and baked them according to the recipe.  They were so chewy and delicous!  My kids gobbled them up!  LOVE this recipe!

A quick cookie that tasted good. Although they didn't taste homemade, they were nice & chewy. I added chocolate chips so they were more of a chocolate chip oatmeal cookie.

Fantastic!  I added 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1/2 cup macadamia nuts to mine (instead of walnuts).  Wow!  Took only 5 minutes to put together.  Second time I made these, I added 1 1/4 cups mini chocolate chips and no nuts.  Awesome!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used a Pillsbury mix and I thought these had a "cake mix flavor" to them. I usually prefer Duncan Hines so maybe I will try with that and see if I notice a big difference. But they were easy enough and I'm sure the first graders will gobble them up no matter what.

These were super light and airy. I added chocolate chips to mine. Really easy to make and delicious! Great if you have cake mix but want cookies instead.

This is simple and fast, I made these cookies with my 5yr grand-daughter she loves them and thinks she makes the best cookies in the world.We also used crunchy peanut butter in half the mix they were great.

I liked these, I made then with pecans.  My husband who doesn't like nuts in his cookies liked them.  they were a nice change from the regular cake mix cookies I have been making.

pretty blah.   I will say they were easy to make. I used butterscotch chips instead of raisins so they will still get eaten but I won't waste a cake mix on these again.

Super easy!  I used a white cake mix and with the oatmeal I added a handful of dried cranberries and some fruit flavored mini-marshmellows.  The kids loved them and so did I.  This is a fun recipe to experiment with.

These cookies were easy to make and with very few ingredients.  They are good to have for a snack around the house, but not impressive enough to bring to events or functions.

I used chocolate cake mix, peanut butter chips and pecans. They turned out chewy and rich. like brownies. Great with coffee! with cake mixes so cheap, less than a dollar a box, I will make these again. Next with lemon cake and white chocolate chips!
