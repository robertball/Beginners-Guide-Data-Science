For the cake, Try this trick my grandma used to do for a tender cake (I always use it)  substitute 2 cups allpurpose flour and 1/2 cup cornstarch for all the flour.  I used 4 more tablespoons of butter and thats it.  I live in the Carribean so things like cake flour are hard to find for household use.  This yields a softer and more tender crumb.  If you want an orange or lemon flavored cake, substitute the water for orange juice or lemonade and add grated rind to the butter sugar mixture.

I was looking for a caramel cake recipe and had not tried one before.  This cake turned out just as I was hoping.  The cake was not too sweet to compliment the extremely rich, thick caramel frosting. Delicious!

"soft balls"  takes between 90 and 120 minutes to form.  Be sure to plan for this time frame when cooking the cake.

This was a pretty good recipe.  It was rather time consuming, but well worth it.  I had to call around to find out what "soft ball stage" meant, but after that, it was all good.

With four eggs, I expected this cake to be a little more light and airy.  I wasn't happy with my results, therefore I didn't even attempt the frosting.

I thought this was very yummy.  It was well received at the party that I made it for.   The cake was a little heavier than I expected, though.

I have a candy thermometer that I use to help me with "soft ball" stage, and I used a small cup of ice water, too, which is how my fathe taught me.  The reviewer who said that it takes 90 - 120 minutes to get to soft ball stage -- Hmmm... I just don't know what to think about that.  My frosting was ready in under 30 minutes.

This was hard not to say that it would not been good if I wasn't a beginner.  I had to throw it away once it was dome baking.  I really don't know where in the process I messed up.  This is Not recommended for a beginner.

This is very tasty. The best food for people that just love caramel. It took hard work but was very worth it in the end. The only thing I suggest is to had 2 more pinches of salt. It really makes a difference. Overall this was a pretty good cake!!!

Great recipe although I didn't have time to let the frosting reach soft ball stage so I ended up serving it as a glaze. And as for the walnuts, I finely ground and sprinkled them on top decorating with a few walnut halves. Very tasty though, my family loved it =]

5 stars for the cake! Wonderful crumb! Follow directions and measurements exactly.The cake was fine textured light and delicate. I used the caramel frosting V for the icing as I had all those ingredients. Came out fantastic. County or state fair blue ribbon entry for sure. Special birthday cake or special occasion cake.  Really really yummy!

Okay. I've had better. I did add a box of instant butterscotch pudding mix to the cake batter to help moisten it. It is a cooking tip that a friend gave me some time ago and it works everytime. The frosting is delicious. I did leave out the nuts since my family doesn't like them.

Very disappointed in this cake. It did not taste like a caramel cake.  It didn't have a bad taste to it, we could eat it, but it wasn't great.  The cake had a very odd consistency to.   I won't make it again!!

This cake was good but a little dry.  The caramel frosting took about 1 1/2 hours to bring to the soft boil stage.  I've done several soft boil stage frostings and this one took a lot longer.  Maybe because of the milk that was added instead of water.  I beat the heck out of the frosting and put it into the fridge before I frosted the cake.  A bit time consuming, but my family really liked it.

My best friend asked for a Caramel Cake for her birthday. Out of the 7 recipes I found, I decided to make this one. I found the frosting hard.  I had to make it twice (I didn't cook it enough first time) BUT it was well worth the effort. My friends and family loved it.

The cake was good but the caramel icing was way too sweet and rich (richer than buttercream).
