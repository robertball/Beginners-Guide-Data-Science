This is a great recipe! I've made it several times, but I have to admit that I change things around everytime as well according to what I have on hand at the house. I live in South Florida so rockfish really isn't our fresh fish of choice, most times I use Dolphin or Yellow Tail. Instead of crabmeat I've used chopped up shrimp as well. I always add a couple popular southern seasonings that we enjoy.... but everything it's been delicious!

The sauce for this recipe is absolutely to die for! It is creamy with just the right amount of seasoning. It would be a great compliment to any mild flavored fish. 5 stars all the way!

Wow, I even impressed myself with this recipe, as it was my first time to make fish. I made it with Red Snapper instead of rock fish, and GeezLouize was it it good. I served it over rice pilaf with fresh garlic bread. My husband and I were racing to sop up the last bit of sauce. Excellant and so easy.

This gourmet dish was super fast to put on the table! I used orange roughy instead of rockfish & I was out of green onions so I used finely minced vidalia. I thought there may be a tad too much dijon in it but when I asked hubby if he thought so, he said "There's mustard in this?" so I guess not. Served it w/ asparagus parmesan (from this site) & croissants. (I added zuchinni to the asparagus so didn't feel I needed another veggie.)

I found this to be delicious. Unfortunatley, my fiance didn't care for it, but i think it was probably just the fact that he's not used to eating seafood with rich sauces (he's from Texas, I grew up on the east coast...our definitions of GOOD seafood are different).   I used sea bass and just plain old bay seasoning. The stored only had blue crab meat so that is what I used. I served it over rice with steamed green beans. I really enjoyed it although if I make it again it will have to be for a different crowd.

This is super easy to make and absolutely delicious. The fish is buttery and flaky and the sauce is rich and creamy. It looks fancy and like a lot of work went into preparing it, but it's actually very simple. I highly reccomend this recipe.

Very good... I made it so quickly, it was hard to believe I was done. From prep to plating, it only took about 20 minutes. I served it with a squeeze of lemon (a must) and rice with vegetables. I sub'd the white wine with sake since I had it on hand. Great recipe.

If Rachel Ray made this dish she would say "Yum-O".  It was great. I had no dijon so used 1/2 t. of dry mustard. (cookbook said use about 1/3 of dry to prepared mustard.) Only other change I would make was a touch of s & p or a splash of chicken stock perhaps to add some depth.  We grilled the fish and made the sauce separately.

This is delish! I don't even like fish or crab, but I thought this was tastey. AND, my husband who is not known for his culinary ability is the one who put this together. We didn't have dijon mustard, so we substituted dry mustard. MMM!

I used haddock, as we don't have rockfish up here, looking forward to trying with other fish as well. I love cream sauces, and my husband dislikes them, and we both really liked this dish. I think the spices and mustard gave it enough flavor that he didn't mind the cream!

Restaurant quality.  The fish took on the crab flavor & was very good to those of us who aren't huge fish fans.  Will serve for dinner guests!  *We didn't have chives so we left them out.

I thought the cream would make this recipe way too rich, but it was perfect!  We will definitely make it again.

Easy, full of flavor and since I could not find rockfish I used Chilean Sea Bass -- WOW!!  It was wonderful! I think I'll use this with just about any fish!  Something easy to find and local, I had to drive a few hours to get the Bass!  Super easy and super tasty!!
