We used vanilla frozen yogurt, and blended it with the carrot juice.  We've also added in fresh orange or pineapple juice. Adjust the amounts to your taste, and you'll get a really good smoothie!

I was very skeptical about mixing carrot juice and vanilla ice cream but it works perfectly well. It's so delicious!!! My husband said I could give it 10 stars even though he knew 5 is the maximum.
