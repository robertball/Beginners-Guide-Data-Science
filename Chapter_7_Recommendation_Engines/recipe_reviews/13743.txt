Excellent recipe!  As a child growing up, my mom made pickled eggs and beets each year as part of our Easter tradition.  I always looked forward to them, and I wanted to find a recipe that matched the way I remember them tasting.  This one did the trick!  I have a large glass gallon pickle jar that I wanted to fill, so I actually used 20 hard-boiled eggs, and I quadrupled (yes, four times as much) the rest of the ingredients.  I used 4 cans of regular (not pickled) whole beets, which gave me 4 cups of juice.  To the juice I added 4 cups of sugar, 3 cups of vinegar, 2 tsps. salt, 1 tsp. pepper, 8 bay leaves, and 48 whole cloves (they're small!).  (As for the onion, I used one extra-large onion, cut it in half, and sliced it into thin half-rings.)  It sounds like a lot, but it made just enough liquid to pour over the eggs, onions and beets in the jar, with just a little left over.  I made two layers each of the three items in the jar--first beets, then onions, then eggs.  I recommend allowing them to refrigerate at least 3 to 4 days.  I made them on Saturday afternoon (3/15), and this morning, Wednesday (3/19), they finally taste like they've developed the full pickled flavor.  Yummy!  Thanks, Cindy, for helping me to recall some fond childhood memories.

Was ok but I still prefer using jars of pickled beets, the store brand is usually best but pick whichever looks more deep purple.  For 6-7 eggs I simmer only 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup cider vinegar with the juice from 1 16oz jar of pickled beets and it tastes exactly like the ones my Pennsylvania Dutch Grandma made and is much easier.  Don't forget to stir or shake once or twice a day for even color.  48 hrs is a minimum, will usually take four days to be colored through.

Tasty eggs. The purple color is outrageous! For my taste, a bit too sweet. However, if you put some tobasco on these, the sweet / hot flavor is very, very good. A good recipe for those who like their pickled eggs a bit sweeter. If you prefer sour, you might not prefer these.

We always had this at Easter when I was a child since we had so many hard boiled eggs left over from the Easter Bunny. My mother used to go one step further, with the leftover beets and pickled eggs - she made 'Beet Salad' - similar to making potato salad, but use beets in place of potatoes. Dice the beets, dice the eggs, chop some celery and onion (if you like both or either) and mix with mayonaisse. The color is amazing as the mayo takes on a beautiful pink color - and the taste is something you'll love forever. Its too bad people have this fear or hatred towards beets - they are the best thing out there! Try the beet salad, you'll love it.

My mother makes pickled eggs with beets, but instead of the brine she puts in a jar of the little yellow hot peppers along with the juice. Wax peppers, not pepperoncini.  If you're looking for a less sweet version, you might like it that way.  This is also an Easter favorite for us, as the eggs come out looking so pretty.

Just recipe is just like the one my Mom used to make.  I was looking for a pickled beet recipe and came across this one.  It is delicious and easy to make - I actually tripled the recipe and it didn't even last a week in the fridge.  If you like pickled beets - these have the perfect blend of spices.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Ok, first I did not follow completely the amount of ingredients. I used only half a cup of sugar, a pinch of ground cloves and only one 15 once jar of pickled beets. I thought the sugar was a bit much, as well as cloves.  Used a quart mason jar and they came out very good! I know....I changed it so how can I rate the recipe? And plus give it 5 stars? Without Cindy`s recipe I could not have made them. Thank you Cindy! These are great!

These always disappear in minutes (okay, days). I use fresh beets - boiled, peeled, and sliced - and they come out nice and pickled with the eggs. The recipe is a bit clove-y for us, so I omit the cloves or just throw in a few, and slice the onion (rather than chop it) so that it's easier to eat.

Instead of canned pickled beets, I use fresh.  I peel, slice and boil them until tender (maybe 30 or 40 minutes), then proceed with the recipe.  They turn out just fine.  This is a super recipe.

I loved this recipe. A little sweet, but an extra 1/2 cup of vinegar took care of that.  Home-canned beets are best to use, but store-bought works fine.  I prefer the onions in thick sliced rings, because I love pickled onions!

Yum ~ just like granny used to make. I like the sweetness of the pickling in these eggs, especially when paired with a horseradish or mustard cream as a condiment to them. I followed this recipe exactly, except I had to top off my container with maybe 1/2 cup water to get the brine to cover the eggs in my container. Worked out fine. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is perfect. My Mother always made them when she was alive, & I never bothered to get the recipe.  When I saw this one I knew it had to be close.  I used fresh beets, no onion or bay leaves, but used cloves; both whole & ground.  I can remember her pickled eggs having cloves. I just made it a while ago and they turned out perfect.  I finally found Mom's recipe! My Dad is still alive (88 years of age) and he agrees.  Love it. Thank you.

I found this wonderful recipe while looking for something to do with my beets from the farmer's market. Love it however I cut the sugar to 1 tbsp. and added 2 tbsp. organic honey. Also, boiled my own beets instead of using canned. Love it and forwarded it to my sister who is a chef. Thank you!!!

I'm a fan of most everything pickled, eggs included.  I tried my hand at couple of other recipes with less than stellar results.  I recently began working a construction project in Hanover, PA, and noticed they had red eggs in the deli section of my local grocery.  I bought them and I was happily overwhelmed by the combination of beets and eggs. I sought out a recipe, and this one popped up.  It is perfect in every respect.  The sweet and sour aspects, along with the spices will make you very happy.

Very sweet. Not sure how sweet or sour pickled eggs are supposed to be because this was the first time I had them. I love the way they look though. For personal taste I will add way less sugar next time

I tried this for Easter thinking it would be fun to have eggs colored in this manner.  The real prize for me though, was the wonderful flavor it made the beets.  I didn't think the pickled beets I bought at the store could be improved.  The eggs turned out very pretty, even after just 24 hours, and tasted wonderful.  I also tried leaving the shells on after gently cracking them all over.  It gave an interesting marbled look.  This was fun!

These pickled eggs were very good!  I made them for a picnic so I doubled the recipe and pickled 1 1/2 doz eggs.  The cloves, bay leaf, and onion added a nice flavor.  I would make these again!

I made these eggs for my Dad, who lives in Amish country, and he said these are the best he's had! They are tasy and very easy.

These are delicious.  I love beets & eggs, but never pickled them together, and had only had "hot" pickled eggs in the past.  Glad I tried this!  I served them on a green salad with ranch dressing and they were a hit with my guest! Very pretty after 4 days - the color was all the way through to the yolks.  I'm making them again today - they will be a "regular" around here, for sure!  Thanks for posting the recipe.

I love these pickled eggs- they have the perfect flavor in my opinion.  I did not have an onion so I used 2 cloves of finely minced garlic instead, and I used ground clove in place of whole cloves and they still came out wonderful.  Yum!

Although I didn't use bay leaves, a lot less sugar and only a 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves, this is almost identical to my late Mother's recipe! I usually double the recipe, my son and I just can't seem to get enough of these when I make them...delicious!

I just used regular beets, but that being said, this recipe is so good.  Probably could use less sugar and it would still turn out excellent.  Beets and eggs together?  Yum!

I used beets only and everyone who ate them liked them.  I will use a different vinegar, or mix, next time to see if I can get a little less of a jolt from the vinegar.

This recipe is absolutely excellent.  None of the spices were too strong and each complemented the other.  The colours of the eggs when sliced, added contrast to other appetizers. I will most certainly be making these often.

Roe asked how to peel eggs easily. There are 3 secrets to peeling hard boiled eggs. #1 you MUST start with COLD water. #2 JUST barely cover eggs b4 boiling.# 3 Add @ least 1 TBS salt per dozen eggs. Also, once water boils start a 10 minute timer. Turn eggs off afterwards and test 1 by putting it in cold water for a minute or so, then cut it in half to test for doneness, it should be cooked all the way thru.Then place remaining eggs in cold water to prevent overcooking . When you go to peel eggs the shell should come right off.

Excellent! I doubled the recipe and used 12 eggs instead of 8. I used canned whole beets (4 cans). I also doubled the liquid (4x's) as it did not quite cover the beets and eggs. Put everything in a gallon glass jar. Yum!

I was excited when I found this recipe.  My great grandmother had a wonderful recipe for Pennsylvania Dutch Pickled Eggs and I was really hoping this was it.  Unfortunately, I think it lacked the vinegar(y) flavor hers had.  I did marinate them for over 60 hours, too.  The whites were still showing inside!   Guess I'll keep looking!

Excellent.   We added sliced onions to it.  Left in fridge for a week and turned out great. Made 60 eggs and took them to a Club we are members to.  Everybody love them, so much they are asking for the recipe.  Really good.  Even the onions dont have onion taste, it's great.

Excellent flavor. Onions are great on sandwiches and probably anywhere else you would want a sweet pickled onion flavor (I'm thinking macaroni salad). Super easy recipe. Hardest part is waiting 4 days for the eggs to get pickled to where I like them. I followed recipe, but added 2-3 whole allspice and a couple small pieces of Cinnamon stick

Have been living in PA for 18 years now (half my life) and decided to give it a whirl in making my own instead of buying  at our local market.  These are phenomenal!  Not to mention the bonus pickled onions you can serve in salads, etc.  I have been making a huge batch (18) every few weeks.

This was the best recipe I have ever made for pickled beets.  I would never have thought to add hard boiled eggs; which were delicious.  Now, this is our family recipe.

Wish I could have tasted the finished product, but the eggs wouldn't peel correctly. Since I started with 10 eggs, I ate one and the egg yoke was not completely cooked.  Disappointed in myself for not boiling the eggs for 15 minutes and then shocking them with ice water to ensure they were thoroughly cooked and easy to peel.

These are the eggs we had at every picnic when I was a child. The aroma of the boiling vinegar took me back to my mother's kitchen! I didn't use the bay leaves or cloves, and the  eggs were wonderful!

Just like my grandmas.  I put diced jalapeños in my jar today.  They aren't done yet for a sample but I'm sure they'll be great.  The original recipe is a little sweet for me but I alter to my liking.

I don't eat pickled eggs, but those in my house that do loved them. I didn't have whole cloves so I used ground cloves.. I added cinnamon. And I made 14 eggs, not 8, so I added a little more sugar, vinegar, and used all of the beet juice in the 2 cans of beet slices.. We will be setting these out for thanksgiving for the whole family to enjoy.. maybe I better make more!

Made these for my youngest daughter who loves pickled anything, and thinks that anything pinkish tests better since it's her favorite color. Only problem was keeping her out of them for the time it took to fully pickle. Otherwise she loved them, and asks me to make them constantly.

A better description, though this one is accurate, would be sweet and sour eggs and beets. I grew up on these, and this is a very good recipe for such.

I used fresh beets! Cleaned them then boiled and used that beet juice for the rest of this recipe! Perfect flavor!

I grew up in Western Pennsylvania where much of the cooking was influenced by the nearby Amish communities.  I now live in Western Colorado and am shocked at the number of people who have never heard of Pickled eggs.  This is a great recipe although this is the first time in my life I ever used a recipe because I just did it the way my mom did. The only change made was using fresh beets and cooking them first.

These were really beautiful and I loved the profile of flavors. Only thing for me (and I had never had dutch pickled eggs so I am biased) was they kind of tasted like ketchup. I think these would be AMAZING if you reduced cloves, more garlic, reduced sugar and hit it with a good dose of cayenne. Not Dutch eggs, but I think it would be tasty!

So delicious.  I did read the reviews and so I reduced the sugar a bit but all around a great recipe.  I grew up eating pickled beets and eggs and this just hit the spot!

Just wanted to say that I tripled this recipe (24 eggs) and I really only needed 4 jars of pickled beets (500ml each), which gave me exactly 3 cups of juice.  Maybe my containers are too small, but I couldn't imagine fitting another 2 jars of beets in there.  The proportions ended up perfectly.  I accidentally cooked the onions with the juice, then added to the eggs & beets... I hope this wasn't a grave mistake.

These eggs are delicious!
I made these alongside traditional pickled eggs (made with white vinegar, onion, pickling spice) to compare. It was difficult for me to decide, I lean a little more towards traditional. However, everyone I made these for went crazy for the Pennsylvania version. Especially because I quartered them and made a floral-inspired display which was beautiful because of the colored layers of the pickled egg mixed with the fading pinks and reds in the onion triangles.
The only problem I have with the recipe is that it's a little awkward, the juice you need is about 1 and 1/4 cans, and I only used one can's worth of beets..that's just me, I felt like 2 full cans of beets would just end up as leftovers.
The first time I made these I didn't have a jar and just used a bowl. I'm not guaranteeing for everyone's dishware, but for me it was just enough to cover the eggs although it was pretty wide.
These are delicious, easy to make, inexpensive, and visually tasty. I definitely recommend putting in the effort to make these. 
Thank you for sharing this recipe, I already gave it to my sister.

My ex-mother in law used to make these eggs and I loved them.  I have looked for a recipe for years so that I could make them myself.  I add a couple sticks of cinnamon to the juice while cooking and slices of onion to the jar with the eggs and beets.

I like this recipe except I use less cloves and l bay leaf.  It's great to have on hand being diabetic.  There's always a quick protein around for me to grab when I feel a little low.
