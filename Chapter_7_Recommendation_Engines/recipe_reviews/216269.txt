Finally found the oyster stuffing recipe I'll make every year!  Made it just like the recipe except added about a teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning. My husband raved over it.

This was my first time trying oyster stuffing.  I usually go the corn-bread and sausage route, but this recipe caught my eye.  Admittedly, the 4 out of 5 stars is more my fault than the recipe's.  I decided to get fancy and use smoked oysters.  The smoky taste was too much with the bacon.  It was still REALLY good, I ate multiple helpings!  But next time I will go with the recipe and just use regular oysters.  But using the same pan that the bacon was fried in to sautee the onions and garlic was genius!  It added such a great texture and flavor.  I'm eager to try this one again as written!  Thanks!

Delicious and easy!  I used a sourdough bread I had on hand and adjusted the recipe to serve three....  my family loved it with duck for Christmas dinner.
