Great recipe!! Prepared it for 18 people at family brunch. Most asked for recipe. I prepared it the night before and that worked well. I'd make this one again. Pat

This was OK... too salty (and I only used a pinch of salt.  This is definitely not a 2-helping dish.  If I do make this again, I may add diced green chiles to the egg mixture and use a mexi-melt cheese combination (even mild cheddar was a bit "much" in this recipe); a more mild, creamy cheese might work better.

I liked this one a lot.  I used brown rice, cooking it about 40 minutes.  Also, the chilis are a must, I think, for this recipe. Without them it might be a bit bland.   It only took about 30 minutes in the oven, not an hour, as the "cook time" says.

GREAT recipe!! I added a rib and a half of celery and three cloves of garlic to the onions and rice and then added fresh parsley and oregano as well. I doubled the sauce recipe and instead of chicken broth, I used white wine for a nice little extra flavor. Instead of salt and pepper in it, I used Adobo seasoning. In the layering I added cooked breakfast sausage. I used Monterey Jack and Swiss cheese and the whole casserole (I put it in a square pan instead) came out FABULOUS!

Delicious!  Prep some of the steps ahead of time.  Serve it with spicy chorizo or linguica for a little more kick.  Everyone who tries this asks for the recipe.  A winner!

I added 1 lb browned sage sausage in the layers and mixed my green chilis with the rice and it is even better than the original.

Recipe turned out very dry and bland, and the rice was too dominant in the taste. Tried a second helping and put hot sauce on and it still wasn't good. Maybe doubling the gravy, and spicing it up would help. As is will never make again. The eggs also seemed to get "rubbery"? Not very good at all. Sorry, everyone else seemed to enjoy it.

I use fewer eggs and add some chicken, then mix in some frozen mixed veggies to make an easy weekend supper that everyone loves.

I am not sure why this recipe has been waiting for a photo for 11 years.  It is an excellent alternative to Cream of Soup casseroles.  I am not sure how much the hard boiled eggs add to this recipe, I suppose you could leave them out or substitute chicken or sausage.  If I make this again I would combine the rice, chilies, sauce and part of the cheese together and skip the layering steps.  Topped with cheese makes a beautiful presentation.

I followed the directions and I am not sure why people like this. Lacks taste. Too much eggs. Not enough gravy. One hour is way too long to bake. A lot of work for something so bland.
