As I started to make this recipe I realized I didn't have onions on hand.  After looking through the cupboard, I narrowed down the choices to an envelope of Liptons dried soup mix and a can of French Onion Soup.  FOS won out....    Pureed the onions in the soup and then added chicken broth to make up the difference in liquid.  Wonderful with substitutions ~

This will be going into our regular meal rotation!  I used a yellow onion (all I had - I rarely buy red) and sauteed it in half butter, half olive oil, and cut back on the pepper, to 1/4-1/2 tsp (I just grind it in).  Delicious!  It's a very flexible recipe provided you stay within the 1:2 rice:water ratio.  We also like to add a bit of minced garlic just before adding the broth.  Editing to add sometimes it takes a little longer than 20 minutes (I find it takes 25-30).  Using equal portions of onion and rice (ie. 1 cup of raw onion, 1 cup of uncooked rice) seems to offer the perfect ratio (for us).  Also very good if you let the onions turn translucent prior to adding the rice so they brown a bit while you "toast" the rice.

Our whole family loved this! I used olive oil instead of butter for sauteeing and added a clove of minced garlic to the onion, which was yellow. Basmati rice worked well for this, and I browned it with the oil and onion for a few minutes. I added parsley, thyme, and basil and increased the broth to 2 cups. Just a few grinds of pepper was all it needed. Try grating in a few baby carrots to give it a nice color. I'll make this again, probably adding almonds or pecans.

This was pleasant and subtle - I'd call it a nice, basic "recipe" for beginner cooks. Still, it is only rice, cooked in broth rather than water, with onions added. I would strongly suggest against the full amount of pepper called for and simply add it to taste. Great to serve as support for a stronger main dish, where you wouldn't want flavors to compete.

Awesome!  I used 1/2 package dry onion soup mix along with the chicken broth.  I only had plain onion on hand, so I used one small one chopped.  I loved this rice!  My husband like it, too.

This was good.  I didn't realize that I had no chicken broth in the house, so I had to use a can of condensed beef broth, mixed with water to make 2 cups.  I loved the onions, and might even add more next time.  I used fresh ground pepper and don't think I put a whole teaspoon in.  It was still a little too peppery.  I used brown rice and just increased the simmer time to 50 minutes.

This is a really good and simple side dish. Like another said add pepper to taste but other than that great as written but also goes well with yellow onions.

I get compliments every time I make this. I use vegetable broth since I don't eat chicken. Only one note, keep a little extra broth to hand, I found the rice nearly dry after 20 minutes.

Very moist and flavorful. I wanted to try it with the onion soup mix, but I didn't have any.  I was pleasantly surprised how tasty this was and how simple it is to prepare.  Yum .....

Was looking for a quick side dish for dinner and had these ingredients on hand. I like red onion and we love rice, so I figured this would be good. Well, I did not like it. For me, the flavors just didn't work. I used half of a medium red onion. The flavor of the onion with the pepper was just odd. Can't imagine how overwhelming it would have been with a whole onion. My husband did not care for it either.

This was SO surprisingly good! My friend and I were looking for a simple rice side dish that we could make from ingredients we had in the house and voila! This served right up and we love it! It's so deceptively simple; it has great taste and is a perfect complement to any meal! Kudos Denyse! Thanks!

I love this recipe, and my husband who hates onions even likes it. I use a yellow onion as we never have red on hand. Turns out great. I usually add water and a bouillon cube more than needed for extra flavor.

We've been making this rice for years.  Only difference is we use one can of broth and then fill that can with water as a subsitution for the second can of broth.  Less saltly and as equally delicious! Always double the liquid to the amount of rice used and you have a winner!

I used two cups of rice, four of broth and only 1/2 teaspoon of pepper.  Also sprinkled a little thyme.  My family says it's the "ultimate".  Of course I had leftovers, which were just as good the next day.  Thankyou for this great recipe.

This is so good and so easy to prepare.  I used extra bouillon and browned it a little (stirring constantly once the liquid was absorbed).  It was better (and a lot more convenient/affordable than rice a roni, zatarans, etc.

I liked it. It is very basic but goes well as a side. We had it with ham and it was a nice subtle dish. It could easily be made into a main dish if the meat were added to it with some broccoli, and tomatos and garlic. You could have fun with this and add almost anything to it and come up with a yummy dish. I think maybe next time I will try sausage added to it.

This was a mild flavored rice that would be a great side dish with just about anything. I only used a third of a large Texas sweet onion and used a little more oil than called for because as soon as the onion was translucent I added the dry rice in and cooked it until it was starting to turn light golden, then I added a dab of minced garlic stirred it in and cooked for less than a minute and finally added in the broth. I forgot the black pepper but it didn't need it after all. Definitely a wonderful rice recipe and I will be making this again. Thanks Denyse!

This was very good. I was surprised. It has good flavor but it is not over powering. I used butter and not oil myself. I also put mine in the rice cooker and it worked out just perfect!

This is the best rice I have ever made!! I loved it and so did my family. Although I just put a little garlic pepper seasoning in it instead of black pepper. Sounded like way too much pepper. I would say let people put the pepper in at the table.

Pretty darn good! I think I would play around with different onions and different kinds of rice and probably add some more veggies (maybe fresh spinach just before serving). As it is though, very good.

Used two small vidalia onions in olive oil, and before adding the chicken broth, added two tablespoons of orange juice- to hint at the spiced orange chicken I was serving it with, and then 1/2 TBS of sesame seeds at the end, just because I love them! I was afraid the orange and onion flavors would contradict, but it was actually very good, and went perfectly with the main dish. Will make again! thanks Denyse!!

Very good, very flavorful.  Made as directed except I used 1/2 olive oil & 1/2 butter for the tablespoon of veggie oil.  I will be making my rice like this from now on.

I have to admit, we really didn't care for this. It came out with the rice still being too crunchy. The overall flavor was good, but the rice itself definitely didn't have enough liquid to make the texture perfect. I think it was because of the long grain jasmati rice I used. I'll try it with another rice next time if I make this again, or I'll add more broth. I also plan on trying to use marg or butter instead of the oil to brown the rice better.

What a simple rice dish to make that is packed with flavor.  I like the color that the red onion adds to the dish.  I made as written and served it along side 'Pork Cutlets with Cranberry Wine Sauce' from AR.

The taste - delicious! However it didn't quite cook all the way through. Recipe called for 20 minutes, I used brown rice, so doubled to 40 minutes. I maybe needed more broth, because it was completely soaked up and the bottom of the pan was starting to burn. I even had it on a really low simmer. Regardless, it was still yummy! Chopped up 1 yellow onion. Added in a few cloves of garlic while sauteeing. Added parsely to the mix as well.  Yum

Great recipe. I used tomato/chicken flavored bouillion cubes. I used 2 instead of one to make it more flavorful. Used yellow onion and Med. grain rice. Just because these are the things I had on hand. It turned out great! Very flavorful. I used a generous amount of black pepper, freshly ground. Great plain, but we liked it even better served with sharp cheddar cheese sprinkeled on top! Thanks for a simple, inexpensive rice dish!

It’s a keeper! The rice turned out tasty, easy to make and good for any kind of main dish. I was making Mexican meatballs with a lot of spices, so I was looking for the rice recipe that would feet into that meal without competing with it and overwhelming in the same time. I saved this recipe because it is a chameleon side dish, will be great with anything:  chicken, fish, veggies, tofu…... you name it!

This was a nice side dish to a very rich chicken recipe that I made.  I did have to add a touch of salt to the rice since I used low sodium broth.  Will be making this again!

Who gets excited about rice???  We did!  This very simple recipe yields amazingly flavorful rice.  I doubled it so I would have leftovers and barely got a first portion.  I used jasmine rice, my own chicken stock, and a vidalia onion rather than red.  This recipe will be repeated many more times, both in my kitchen and in those of my guests.  Thanks, Denyse!

My daughter who doesn't like onions liked this.  I did use instant rice and it turned out great (needed it done quicker).  I didn't fry the rice- after sauteing the onion I added the broth, got it to boil then added the rice, took it off the heat and covered it.  I also used sweet white onion as I was worried the red onion might not look as nice.  Very good!!

I don't know how I could have screwed this one up.  It was a very simple recipe, but it was not good.    I substituted a yellow onion as some other raters recommended.  It was very bland with no flavor at all, and the onions created an unpleasant mushy texture.  I would have preferred plain white rice to this recipe.

Very good side dish.  I served this along with some fresh green beans seasoned with a teeny bit of sesame oil, some garlic, salt and some ginger with the Tasty Sesame Tilapia recipe on this site...wonderfully easy, and super delicious meal.

This rice is great! I was leery of putting a whole teaspoon of black pepper in it but it have a great flavor. I sauteed it then put in the rice cooker. I also added 3 whole allspice because I love the subtle flavor enhancement. I will definitely make this again many times.

Very good! I used a combination of yellow and green onions, olive oil instead of veg. and added 2 cloves of minced garlic. I added the black pepper to taste. We thought this had really good flavor without being too onion-y and I will be making it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I'm giving this recipe five stars, even though I cheated.  I had leftover fried rice from Chinese take-out that I wanted to use up.  To that I added a cup of cooked rice I already had waiting in the freezer.  I sauteed about four green onions, including the green tops, in one T. of butter, for one minute and poured that into the rice combo.  I re-heated it in the microwave before serving - couldn't have been easier!  Maybe not quite the same recipe, but the concept was there, and I ended up with a pretty, not to mention, thrifty side dish!  Thanks for the idea!

Great subtle taste. I picked this recipe because I had a huge tub of chopped vidalia onions I had to bring to a big hot dog cook out, but forgot them at home. I didn't have the green onion, which probably would have been better or maybe a combo of both types of onion. Anyway, this went well with the black-eyed peas and oven fried chicken, I made. I really thought the black pepper flavor and heat stood out and just loved it. Thanks, gapch126!

This was Slammin! Really simplicity at its best! Only change I made was to add garlic with the onion and frozen peas while cooking. This recipe really makes perfect rice. Im sure Im gonna be having this again and again. Thanks so much:)

AWESOME--I made two changes-used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and used brown rice instead of white rice--it was great, and so EASY.  This will be used quite often in my household.  Thanks Denyse!

I make rice several times a week, and am always looking for interesting items to add to it. My teens both loved this and commented that it was "great rice". This is a keeper, I think it gets its flavor from the red onions. Thanks!

I liked this, but it was a bit too peppery for me, and I like pepper.  I'd cut the pepper down by at least a half.  Maybe even a fourth.

So easy to make & so good to eat!  This dish was risotto-like and peppery (due to the fresh ground pepper - a necessary addition).  This dish was done so quickly that we were eating it out of the saute pan while waiting for the chicken to finish cooking.  Great side dish!

This is a simple and light rice side dish that is easy and flavorful. I recommend using a smaller amount of pepper, it was a little too much for our tastes, so we'll cut back on it the next time we make it. Other than that we enjoyed it and will make it again.

I used a vidalia onion and sauteed it in butter and olive oil. I added rice and garlic powder and sauteed a bit longer. I used beef broth (it was all I had thawed). The flavors were outstanding. My husband, who is not a huge fan of rice, had three servings.  My small kids loved it as well.  I will definitely be making this again!

I tried it with brown rice/wild rice mix and it was pretty good although I had to cook for 60 minutes and put an extra 1/4 cup of water/chicken. Will make again, but probably add tiny dice of carrots, and peas to give it more textures.

This is a good basic recipe but it does need a lot of additional seasoning and tweaking to make it a five star recipe. I'll use it as a base recipe from now on.

This rice was great! I used only 1/2 of the red onion and added garlic when I added the chicken broth.  I believe next time I will add a little more broth because it seemed to be drying out faster than it was cooking.  This is a great alternative to prepared boxed rice and has great flavor.  Will be making again.  Had this with roasted chicken and sauteed asparagus.

This is such a great, easy side dish. I use it all the time, as it is quick to prepare and goes with just about anything. I do usually use olive oil instead of veg and I will sometimes sub water and chicken bouillon for the chicken broth, depending what I have on hand. We really enjoy it. Thanks for sharing!

This didn't thrill me. Too much pepper (and I usually double black pepper in recipes, but not here) but what I really disliked was the texture the onions added. They were no longer crunchy, but they also weren't caramelized, so they were just...soft. We'll finish it, because it's not that much (for the record, this is a 4 serving recipe; 1/4 cup dry rice per person is THE standard serving size for rice, and adding an onion doesn't bulk that up really) so we'll give this a neutral rating of 3 stars. Not terrible, but not one we'll have again. Thanks for the recipe, I like trying things outside my comfort zone, win or lose :)

I would make this again.  I added more caramelized onion to the rice and used olive oil.

Very Tasty!!! I did have to make a few substitutions as I did not have oil, red onions or white rice. Instead I used cooking onion browned in butter, and Basmati rice. I also only used half the pepper suggested & just before serving I added about 3/4c cooked from frozen green peas. Wonderful recipe, will do it again :)

Surprisingly good for a short simple recipe! I used olive oil, yellow onion and brown rice. I also added a tsp of salt-free roasted garlic seasoning spice.

So simple, yet very tasty side dish.  Shockingly I am not a potato eater, so I always make rice to serve instead.  Even my very picky lil boy eats this.

I used beef boullion (broth) instead of chicken, because it's all I had. Still turned out great, and the pepper makes it a little spicy! My boyfriend loved it! I look forward to adding this to my recipe box and also making it my own, experimenting with different spices/veggies to add to it.

This is a great recipe! I made this for dinner with my mexican meatloaf & it was a big hit. I added a few things just per our taste. I caramelized the onions & added garlic at the end of that along with the rice which I toasted a bit, then added thyme & basil & let it simmer. Great recipe even for my family of onion haters, they couldn't believe it had onion in it ( I used a yellow one).

Very good.  I used brown rice and it took about 50 min to get done.  I added a dash of cayenne pepper which gave it just the right kick.

Loved it! I used basmati rice and it cooked like a dream. While chopping the onion, I thought it looked a bit much in proportion to the rice - it's not: throw the whole onion in! The pepper gives quite a kick! It's great because it also complements a lot of different flavors.

How I usually make rice when I consider it "plain"  Chicken broth always makes a world of difference in rice.  It's a great method, but wouldn't call it special.

Very good rice! Nice change from the plain white and spanish style rice I usually make. It's Friday so needless to say my pantry and fridge are empty, tomorrow is grocery shopping day. I only had just a little bit of everything and a lot of wine that was given to me for X-Mas. I literally had 1 cup of rice, so I paired this with the Modenese Pork Chops on this site. I also had half a cabbage and fried that up. I had some left over potatoes I made, simply sliced thin (almost like chips) with onions, olive oil and herbs and baked in the oven. It actually turned out to be a really good meal all together.

Good simple side dish for an entree that has a lot of flavor. Not a stand out recipe, noone commented on it. I had to add salt, but that probably depends on the brand of chicken broth you use.

Oh my goodness, this was awesome!  When the onion was nearly done I added 2 cloves of garlic, chopped.  That was the only change I made.  I will be trying the base recipe with other grains, as well!  Definitely a keeper.

This is GREAT!  Made it for my family and my picky brother (who hates onions) asked for a third helping!  Wonderful....I fried some chicken chunks with extra virgin olive oil, a splash of white wine, garlic, oregano, flour and parmasen cheese prior to cooking the rice.  I fried the rice a little longer added the chicken to it and it turned out great!  Wonderful either way!  Becoming my side-dish-secret-weapon for dinner parties!

I absolutely loved this recipe! It was quick and easy to prepare, and my boyfriend and I loved the taste. I only strayed from the recipe a bit by adding a bit of minced garlic(about 1/2 tsp.) to the onions while they sauteed, and I used basmati rice for a little change too. I served salmon with lemon-basil cream sauce (wonderful recipe found on this site) over the rice. The different flavors mingled beautifully! Thank you Denyse for a great recipe!

I used beef cubes and served as a side with beef.  Everyone really got exceited about it, and my 3 and 9 year old had seconds.  Red onions are sweet and less potant than regular onions so it lightly flavors the rice, it's not overpowering.  This would be a great substitution for the expensive boxed rice at the store.

Good! I used less onion and added a little salt but was tasty. The directions were a little confusing as it doesn't specify exactly when you should add the rice (before you bring the broth to a boil? After? Do you saute it for a few minutes with the onions?) I waited until the broth was boiling and it turned out good for us. Worked well with our "southwestern chicken" meal tonight.

There's just one big problem....this was WAY too peppery!  I thought I had dinner ready and tasted it and couldn't eat it like that....had to add some cream and simmer it a little to thicken it. That helped.  Next time half the pepper.

Wonderful!  It is so simple but tastes so elegant.  I followed the recipe + added some fresh chopped rosemary.  The rice was so fluffy.  We love onions here!!!

This is a great recipe to add a little oomph to rice.  I use a yellow onion and grate it to hide it from my picky eaters.

I thought it was pretty flavorful, but I did add the juice of one small lemon and I think that zested it up a bit.  Overall, it had a nice flavor and i would make it again!

Wow, this was good.  This rice is talked about all the time on the Buzz so I had to try it.  I couldn't imagine what all the fuss was about but was I wrong!  This rice is amazing!  I cooked the onion down until it was just getting browned and crispy around the edges.  I did not add any pepper and can't imagine what a whole teaspoon would taste like.  This one is a keeper for sure!

This is a very good side dish for those nights that you want or need to keep it simple.  I used brown rice and added mushrooms and some sesame oil along with a bit of soy sauce the second time I made it.  Yummy!

I used butter and it turned out really good... it reminded my of rice-a-roni only better.. very heavy on the black pepper so if you don't like that I would advice cutting back on it.. but I liked it so for me it was good. very easy to make.... a nice change of pace from just plain rice

I found this to be bland and was really surprised that it had such a high rating.  If you are looking for a very basic rice recipe this one will work, make sure you serve it with something with a lot of flavor.

Loved, loved, loved this!  I served this with lentil soup, and it was the perfect accompaniment.  I made it with chicken broth as the liquid, and thought it would need the lentils because it would be too bland.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The rice could stand easily on its own, and I found myself stealing bites on multiple occasions while waiting for the lentil soup to finish cooking.  Truly delish!

Made this following the recipe and while it was delicious, HOLY PEPPER!  I didn't mind the heat but it was tough for my children to get down.  In the future, I will half the pepper and see how that comes out.

I have probably cooked this rice 4 times within the last 8 days. It is the best! My mom said that we wouldn't have to buy Rice-A-Roni anymore! I only had Jasmine Rice at hand so I used that, it came out pretty good. Also I didn't any chicken stock so I measured out two cups of hot water and dropped 4 Bouillon cubes in the water while the rice was browning. Excellent!

This was awesome with a yellow onion!  I don't think I'll even bother with red onions.  I didn't expect so much flavor.  I added a little salt and a bay leaf.

Very tasty and added a nice twist to just plain old rice. I did saute the onions and then cooked everything in the rice cooker. Only alteration I did was to use equal amounts of rice and chicken broth.

The flavor was great toasty, nutty and sweet.  My only complaint would be that the rice was kind of sticky and not the greatest consistency, but that is probably my fault

Wowza!!  I usually don't follow recipes exactly, but I came pretty close with this one!  The only changes I made were using 2 heaping tsp of better than boullion and 2c water for the broth and adding a tsp of minced garlic once I was browning my rice.  Oh and I used butter and olive oil instead of veg oil.  This was a hot little dish I plan to make again.  Love it when the simple and cheap dishes are total success!!!!

I halved the recipe and ate every bite for lunch! The red onion is a key ingredient that I wouldn't substitute. I added chopped fresh garlic (yum) for the cholesterol lowering benefits. I only had Minute Rice on hand, so it took just 5 minutes to steam after browning. I cook all the time, and I've found that often it's the simple and delicious recipes like this that end up with a permanent place in my recipe file. I can't wait to try it with steamed or roasted asparagus!

This was pretty good and very easy. Make sure you serve it with something that has a lot of flavor because the rice itself does not have too much flavor. I served it with jalepeno stuffed chicken. mmm

Wow, that was really good rice.  The only change was chicken stock instead of chicken broth.  We will have this over and over.  Thanks!

I hate to be a spoil sport, but I did NOT like this rice at all - - - it reminded me of a mixture my mother used to make combining minute rice & cream of chicken soup, but without the flavor.  So so sorry, but not for me.

A can of broth has almost 2 cups but not quite so I added water to make up for it rather than opening another can of broth for just a little liquid. I recommend a LARGE onion. Seems like a lot but it is not. I served this with blackened tilapia and avocado slices. A nice twist rather than plain ol' white rice.

We adjusted this by using yellow (hot) onions, quadrupled the recipe and used my rice cooker. But in the rice cooker, 2:1 is too wet for us. I will reduce to 1.5:1 and maybe even down to 1:1. This will be a staple for us.

Tasty but peppery!  I used butter instead of vegetable oil and yellow onion instead of red onion.  Next time I will reduce the black pepper to 1/2 teaspoon.

i always have onions i always have rice and im always looking for a side dish so this was good. i saw this mentioned on the exchange as oniony rice and i searched it a while back and never could find it so i set out to make my own version of what i thought it should be. heres what i do same concept and i use poor folks food ie white onion plain white rice bullion cubes etc. i heat the oil or butter then brown the onion with a smidge of garlic powder then i toast my rice with the onions add the liquid ( using water) and 2 or 3 bullion cubes. i let it boil turn it down and leave it alone until its rice. to make it pretty i shake in whatevers dried green a spice and in the pantry just a little, and bam its good. im going to make this alot and change it up i like rice i just dont like it plain.

OMG I tried this last night and to my surprise....SOOOO GOOD!  My husband (who is the cook of the family) was really impressed.  The rice has almost a silky texture to it (I used parboiled rice) and the only disappointment was that I didn't make enough for lots of leftovers for the next day!

I served this alongside Halibut Weaver, from this site also, which is a very rich dish.  I needed a nice simple side and this worked out well.  I did add mushrooms and a sprig of thyme while it cooked.  Thanks for this recipe gapch1026.

This was so good! I used half butter, half oil and both red and white onions. YUM! I put a sprinkle of salt in when the onions were cooking, and it need just a pinch more when it was done cooking. I will be making the over and over again!

Yummy & Easy. I just made this for the 2nd time with a sweet yellow onion and garlic, and then used it as a base for chicken "fried" rice, without the fry. I added a little bit of soy to the chicken broth. When it was cooked I threw it in with some already cooked egg whites, diced chicken, carrots, peas and corn. It came out healthy and delicious.

This was really good.  I fried the onion and rice then put it in my rice steamer.  I used chicken broth and added a minced garlic clove.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow night.

Very good variation to plain rice.  I don't like to use plain white rice so I substituted jasmine rice instead.  It was VERY good.  I will definitely make it again.

My mom used to make this recipe for many years. She made it from left over rice. Instead of the oil, she used butter to saute the onions. Salt and pepper to taste. This is still my favorite way to use left over rice! I always make extra rice just so I have the leftovers for this dish.

Subtle and understated. Extremely easy to make, and adds a unique flavor without detracting from the main course.  I followed the recipe except I added a little garlic with the onions, and substituted olive oil.  I will definitely make this again!

This is a surprisingly easy and tasty side dish.  If you just have an onion and rice and are scrambling for a side-dish, this is a good idea.  It adds flare to a normally boring rice dish

Didn't think I'd like this as much as I did, but this was a nice change from plain white rice. Used a sweet onion instead of a red one. Added a clove of minced garlic and used olive oil instead of butter. Just eyeballed how much pepper I wanted with a little parsley. I'd make this again.

I had to make an extra side dish on the double last night and I found this one to be quick and easy. It tastes alot better than just plain old rice and went well with the steaks I made.

This was a great change from my usual rice.  The flavour was just right for a side dish, not too overpowering, but tasty just the same.  Very easy to make, it didn't really take that much more time.

This rice was fine, but nothing spectacular...I couldn't really tell that I spent the extra time and ingrediants on it as opposed to just making Rice A Roni. I don't think I would make again.

Yum! Wonderful! After browning the rice in a pan I transferred the whole thing to my rice cooker, then added a tablespoon of butter just before serving. Will definitely make this again.

My husband would really prefer that I didn't try new recipes and stick with what I know he likes but since finding this site I've tried many new dishes.  This was one he liked.  I cut the pepper back to 1/4 of a teaspoon as some suggested but next time I'll do 1/2.  Also it needed a little salt.  I may work on it a little more but basically it was very good and a nice change from plain rice.

I used mayan sweet onion, because I didn't have red.  I also threw in some minced garlic and a small can of green chilis.  I stuffed flank steak (see recipe for stuffed flank steak)with this and some fresh spinach.  My family loved it!

This was a very easy dish to make.  I used minute rice so I had to double the rice the recipe called for.  My 6 year old thought it was too peppery, so I would probably put in less pepper next time for her.  The whole dish tasts really good, but for some reason mine turned a gray color. . .

My husband has to add soy sauce to rice to make it worth eating, but this dish had so much flavor we didn't add a thing.  I only used half the pepper (I thought I could add more at the table if it needed it, and it didn't).  Made it in the rice cooker too!

This was really good. I only used 3/4 tsp of pepper and it was still really spicy. My husband and I liked it like that, but my kids thought it was too spicy. I also added 3/4 tsp of salt and that was just right. This is definately worth having again. It worked very well with chicken, but would be just as good with any meat.

Pretty good, but VERY onion-y.  Next time I think I'll cut back on the onion and experiment with some spices.  Good if you don't want just plain rice.

As is, it was just okay. I made some changes and then everyone seemed to like it a lot. I sauteed white onion, celery (leafy greens and all) and garlic in butter. Then toasted the rice and I always use chicken base (btb) in lieu of chicken broth. After it was finished, I added a good handful of thinly sliced almonds for a little crunch.

Love this recipe.  Its so easy to make, and it takes plain rice and gives it so much flavor!  I use Jasmine rice all the time which has a little more flavor on its own, but this recipe takes it up another notch.

yes I made a few changes I added green  onions chopped and chopped mushrooms. It was more like a meal I think next time I will add chopped chicken breast and maybe a can of mushroom soup or chicken soup. Really good for you it's like a dinner very filling.

Simple yet tasty dish. Subbed 1/2 veg boullion cube instead of chicken broth. As others have said, WAY too much pepper , i would suggest starting with a 1/2 teaspoon. You can always add more if it seems underseasoned.

Like others have said-it is a very basic recipe. The rice was better with the sauce from a chicken dish I made with it. Definitely something that can be built upon.

READER BEWARE---I changed some things.  I used microwave brown rice .  I sauteed 1/3 of an red onion in a sauce pan with butter and then added the cooked rice to which i added some chicken broth to moisten it up and fresh parsley to finish.  It looked and tasted great.

My family and I did not care for this recipe. Since we don't like pepper very much, I halved it. It was still way too much.

Yummy.. Made too much and excited for the leftovers. Used jasmine rice and chicken stock. Toasted the rice with a half of very finely chopped red onion and half packet of onion soup mix. Then added all ingredients to rice cooker, the house smelled divine. Tasted good too. No need to add salt as well!

This is a go-to side. My husband, who is from Charleston, SC, is picky about his rice. He and the rest of our family love this recipe. I add some freshly minced garlic to bring out the savory onions. Thanks for sharing.

The only thing that I changed from this recipe is that I don't use the big onion but I use the combination between garlic and red onion(both is called onion in my country) and the recipe turns out fantastic :) It has become regular recipe when I'm too tired of making another side dishes :D

I MAKE THIS ALL THE TIME.  So easy and yummy and I make double batches so we can have leftovers. Better the next day too. I add frozen green peas at the boiling stage for a kick off sweet and extra texture.

Used basmati rice . A yellow onion ( didn't have red) Added I clove of garlic. Cut down on the pepper. But that was it. We really enjoyed this rice. Will definitely make it again.

Made this tonight as a quick side, wasn't to bad. Nice change from regular rice or potato. I used white onion because that's what I had on hand and pepper to taste.

Easy and delicious.. The rice turned out a little sticky (but I like it that way) so maybe a little less chicken broth would be better..

Was easy to make. Loved the flavor - I don't use store bought broth in anything but I use Knorr chicken base and 2 cups of water.

I just made this tonight to go with grilled chicken and it was great. My family and I love pepper but we thought there was a bit too much. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.

We loved it!  (My youngest had 3 servings!)  I'm pretty sure I had made this one other time, but didn't like it enough to even write a review.  This time I followed the suggestions by Faith on Dec. 11, 2008 (Thanks Faith!!) and it was super yummy! Served it with Yummy Lemon Salmon Burgers from this site and veggies and it made for a great meal.  Have added this to my recipe box.  Thank you, Denyse.

Femeril gives this a 3 star rating.  Add some garlic-according to your taste and may be some white pepper.  It was rather dry so consider a white wine reduction and some parmesan cheese or parm/romano cheese.

Very good rice. It has a good flavor. I generally still in some peas at then end just to add colour so it doesn't look so boring.

This was a surprise to me.  I was all out of broth. Since we were having it with beef I used 2 c of water and 2t. Better than Bullion beef and followed the rest of the recipe.  It was really good!  The kids asked for seconds!    Woo-hoo!  I'll put it into rotation at our house.  Thanks

Usually I just make rice a roni when I need a rice side dish, but I decided to start trying out my own.... This was the first one I tried, I liked that it was easy and only a few ingridients but it was a little bland. Might make again some day for some reason but not sure when or why.

This was good. I did add some frozen peas and carrots to the mix and some onion powder, but hubby ate it and took some for lunch the next day and hes VERY picky so it was a success! I will add to recipe box.

Very easy & delicious. I only used 1/2 tsp pepper. I would suggest starting with that and you can always add more if desired. I also used a mix of white and brown rice. Served with Szechwan Shrimp from this site and it was awesome.

I have to be honest; I wasn't expecting this to be anything to write home about.  Talk about less is more!  This was actually rather tasty!  I did use seasoned bouillon cubes instead of broth (I was out!), so that may add to the tastiness.  Either way, I will definitely keep this in mind, and though it may not be the most mouth-wateringly delicious thing I've ever made, it still gets five stars for versatility as a side dish - and extra kudos points for the fact that I already have the recipe memorized!

I followed this as listed and it was just 'okay' for me.  I will give it another go and see if I can't tweak it a little bit.

I was a little skeptical that this would be good.  I used a white onion & basmati rice instead.  I was nervous about cooking the rice in chicken broth though, because Im pretty much a beginner at cooking and I had never heard of cooking rice in anything but water and I tend to burn things, but I was pleasantly surprised at how good this turned out.  I made it again the next night but I added fresh raw mushrooms, some peas and soy sauce.... WOW! It was awesome! I will make this again!!!

I served this with baked chicken when I had dinner guests over.  Personally, I thought it was a little bland. However, I had very little left over and my 2 year old devored it, continually requesting more.  Instead of using regular black pepper, I used seasoned pepper.  I think this made a difference in making sure there wasn't too much of pepper taste.

My husband and I really enjoyed.  I made with chicken kabobs and they went well together.  After reading reviews, I added the pepper a little at a time tasting as I went along until I got the taste we were looking for.  Thanks!

Excellent side dish - went great with our kabobs.  Recipe called for too much pepper, so like other reviews I cut that way down.  Also added some minced garlic and thyme.  We will definitly use this again

The recipe is great as is and we often use Onion Rice in our other recipes where rice is used because the flavor is very accomodating. The flavor is not like that of an onion and those who do not like onions will surely like this side.

I used yellow onion with a little green onion added for some color.  Chicken granules dissolved in water for the broth provided all the seasoning required... this is a simple and tasty side dish that can be "customized" to go with almost any meal.  It made a great accompaniment for my marinated and grilled tilapia entree.

This is super easy and yummy rice.  I like it better than boxed mixes, and it's so easy to make it healthier by adding veggies you like. I added some garlic and fine chopped carrot.  Made a double recipe and put chopped chicken and green peas in it for an easy lunch for the following day.

I made this last night as a side dish to argentinian empanadas. It was good, though I´m not sure I´ll add the pepper next time I make it. Make sure your family LOVES onion if you make this. I do, so I liked it pretty well!

This is a very good way to jazz up regular white rice. I made white rice using the Boil-in-Bag kind then added the rice at the end. This recipe needs a little garlic and salt to make it a bit more flavorful, though.

The onions gave the rice a odd greyish color. And it was a little too peppery for me. But it's still pretty good. I will def. try this again and use less pepper and maybe a yellow onion.

This came out great! If you use yellow onion I suggest using only half a small onion. I added 2 small garlic cloves as well. I will definitely be making this on a regular basis. Delicious! Thanks for a quick and easy way to make a great side dish!

Nice Change of pace. I would suggest only using half of an onion though. I ended up adding another 1/2 cup of rice to it and it was still a little TOO onion-y.

Pretty good, made it in the rice cooker then sauteed it with the onion and some garlic.   Added frozen peas like in the photo.  I am not a huge "rice person", but my husband is and he loved it.

very good. The only changes I made were that I used 2 cups minute rice so it wouldn't take so long and instead of Vegetable oil I used SmartBalance buttery spread made with olive oil. I did add a little minced garlic in with the onion too as someone suggested.  Very easy and good side dish!!  The chicken broth I used I made from two cups water with 2 chicken bouillon cubes.

We didn't like this much. . . We did use yellow onions instead of the red, but I probably won't try this again.

This rice is perfect and needs no other seasonings.  I was a little aprehensive about about browning the dry uncooked rice, as that is unlike anything I'd done before.  Somehow in browning the uncooked rice the onion flavor is infused into the rice and gives it a full robust flavor.  All of my children and my husband really liked this rice dish and it was extremely easy to make.  Have already made this rice again and again and again.  Once I was out of fresh onion and used dried onion instead, but I don't recommend it because the flavor was just not there.  It wasn't bad though by any means it just needed a little soya sauce.

Very good rice dish.  I was looking for something different to serve as a side and my husband is not a fan of rice but it was quick that night and I had all the ingredients in house.  My 9yr old son hates onions and I put in a whole red one which was pretty large, added about 4 cloves of chopped garlic too and my son and husband both loved this dish!  I also had made some chicken soup the day before and so I used the stock for my cooking liquid which I'm sure made a huge taste difference.  Will make this again!

This was a great base recipe. I didn't really follow the instructions because my hubby is allergic to onions. I used garlic instead. I forgot the black pepper in the cooking portion but seasoned each portion on the plate. The pepper is definately needed though. Very yummy and a change from regular rice.

I only used a half onion, I now know it's okay to use a whole, it doesn't taste like there's too much onion at all. I have never seen my daughters face perk up so much from eating rice! Will make again & again!

After reading all the reviews, I expected major "wow" with this recipe.  It wasn't there.

It was a good recipe, but not excellent.  I would make it again, sure, but it's not something my family will be asking for weekly.

I tripled this recipe for a crowd. Served it with "Yummy Honey Chicken Kabobs" from this site. Everyone, including 3 teenage girls, loved it. Used Vidalia onions - nice taste but rice was rather bland looking -no color. Next time I might add chopped carrots or fresh parsley to make it look more inviting.

I thought this was very good and very easy!  I used my own home-made chicken stock which made it very rich.  It's great standing as the recipe is written, however I do think a couple cloves of garlic wouldn't hurt anything.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a good, quick rice dish. I used instant rice (all I had on hand, but will use Basmati next time) and added some minced garlic in with the onions and oil. It had a nice flavor and was super simple! My only "issue" was that the red onions ended up making the dish an odd color (grayish) when it all finished cooking. Next time I will probably use a Vadalia onion instead so the dish doesn't end up with an unappetizing color.

This was so good! I didn't have red onion and the only grocery store in town that was open on a Sunday (I live in a SMAALLL town) only had rotten red onions (seriously, they were smushy and brownish) so I substituted half of a regular onion instead. This was an amazing side dish and I will DEFINETELY make this again and again!

Used a combination of white rice and brown rice and added a couple of cloves of garlic but otherwise followed the recipe. This came out a little bland for my taste nonetheless, would probably add some herbs next time as other reviewers have suggested.

Was ok. Kind of bland, if I make it again I will definitely add some spice to it. Served with Southwest Chicken and I think the sauce from it saved the rice.

I just wanted to say that this recipe was a BIG hit in my home.  Hubby loved it and even commented that his grandmother had to have helped me with the recipe!  Gramma thought it was packaged rice because it was so good...My 16-month old ate it all up, which is amazing because he has only wanted cheerios for the past month!  I made it two nights in a row and everytime, its all gone!  I'll have to double the recipe next time.  This is a great recipe and will be a staple in my home.  I will try it with olive oil (as another member suggested)to cut down on the fat since it looks like we will be having this instead of rice and fattening gravy.

I didn't have long-grain white rice, but did modify based on the rice I had available, which was instant white rice. I prepared two cups of white rice as instructed on the box. Meanwhile, I sauteed the onion, a little can of mushrooms, and 1 teaspoon garlic in another pan.  I poured the chicken broth and the onion mixture into the rice and simmered for ten minutes or so, adding the pepper and (this is key) 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of garlic salt. Just shake the garlic salt in until it tastes "right." The garlic salt truly brought this recipe together.  Do note, when you simmer the mixture as the last step, it must be stirred routinely--just like risotto; it has a tendency to stick to the pan without stirring. As a side dish, this is four to five star. I look forward to trying the recipe as written but I had to go with what I had on hand.

This was very moist and full of flavor.  I used instant rice and it only needed some extra water.
 It was even great the next day reheated and if you know rice is usually not good reheated.

I will make this recipe again and again.

I have been visiting this website for years and this is the only recipe that has ever prompted me to leave a review. I made this rice alongside the "Garlic Chicken" recipe, with an assortment of baby vegetables. I have two fussy eaters in my home, my father and my husband, and they both absolutely loved this recipe. I constantly use these men as guinea pigs, but I've never heard either one of them describe a new recipe as "Phenomenal". 
I did use olive oil, but I followed the rest of this recipe to the letter. This is definitely a keeper. Thank you!

I thought this was pretty good, a little too much pepper though. I added some shredded carrots for color and some whole kernal corn and little tomato sauce and garlic salt and it turned out really good. I will make it again!

I thought this was pretty good, but it definately needs more spices.  I added garlic as the other reviews suggested, as well as salt. I was a little dissapointed based on so many 5 star reviews, but it was overall a good dish.  Next time I will use a lot more spices in addition to the garlic and salt.

Good recipe.  If you're looking for a nice, easy side dish this is it.  If you're looking for something with lots and lots of flavor, I would skip this one.  We liked it a lot with a pork tenderloin.  Very good just not knock-your-socks-off-good.

Very Good! I used margarine instead of oil and also added slivers or red and green bell peppers. I used quick rice (5 minutes in microwave)and combined everything at the end. Quick, easy and quite good.

This was quite good! Looking at the ingredients, you can't tell it will be so flavorful.  I used butter instead of oil and added some chopped garlic too.  We will definitely be having this again.

I enjoyed this rice; however, unless you love hot stuff, use about 1/8th teaspoon of pepper. I used a 1/4 teaspoon and it was still spicy to me! Also, I think next time I will also add half a packet of dry onion soup mix as a previous review suggested.

The pepper in this ruined it for me. There was way too much and it was all I could taste. I used 1 cup of water and 1 tsp of onion soup mix in place of half of the broth and also used 1/4 tsp of salt. I will try this again but cut down the pepper to about 1/4 tsp or use other spices instead.

We LOVED this! I was looking for something to add to plain rice and my husband raved about this and my 3 year old daughter had 2 helpings! The only thing I added was some salt when I fluffed it. Thank you for a great recipe!

This was a nice change from just plain rice or rice made with boullion.  Not spectacular, but worth making for sure.  Thanks for the recipe!

this rice was amazing!!! i added some butter to the rice just minutes before fluffing, and it made all the difference.  even the leftovers were great. Try this under the "grilled salmon with lemon basil cream sauce" found on this site.
you won't be sorry

Hey Denyse, great recipe!! My kids adore rice no matter how I make it, but they really flipped over this. Hubby, who normally doesn't care for rice, loved it too! Once my onions were just about done, I stirred in basmati rice and let it brown a bit. The onions and the broth really gave this side a very nice flavor. Thanks so much.

An interesting way to serve rice, but it needed a little something. Maybe I should've added butter. It's taste was kind of thin, and too peppery.
