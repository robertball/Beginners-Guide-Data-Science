I made this for friends and family and also for an 85-person brunch. Everyone loved it! For a little extra spice try putting in 1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper. Also if you want to use fresh eggs, use 8 large eggs, or however many eggs it takes to make 1 1/2 cups (12 ounces).

I lost my old breakfast casserole recipe and this one looked similar, so I tried it.  It was a big hit.  I did make some changes - instead of the cartons of eggs, I used 12 oz of real eggs (about 8 large); I also added 2 cups diced ham instead of 1 and for the last five minutes of baking I sprinkled grated cheese on top and browned it.  Yummy!

This recipe was enjoyed for Christmas brunch. As usual, I did make some adjustments. I used 10 large eggs, whole milk, 1/2 tsp. salt, eliminated the green pepper, and subtracted 2 cups of potatoes from the bag. It seemed like the whole bag would have been too much potato for our tastes. Next time I think I will use 12 eggs, a little more milk and still use less potatoes. I would have liked the green peppers, but I know my family would not have liked it. Mushrooms would probably be a great addition too. Great base recipe, which can easily be adjusted to your tastes. I liked how quick it was to prepare on a busy Christmas morning.

This recipe works well and is easy.  I substituted regualr eggs and only used 6 but I still felt it was too eggy for my liking and I would have liked more hashbrowns.  I added a bit of rosemary to kick up the ham and I liked that addition.  I will use this recipe again with a few changes.

Prepared this on Christmas morning, New Years morning, and again for a quick evening meal.  I guess I could say I will prepare it again.  It is easy and really pleases teenage palates.

This was good but needs more zip.  I'd make it again but I'd use more cheese and maybe some salsa?

Tried this one on company, and everyone agreed it was "okay" but needed something else.  We thought maybe using sausage in place of the ham would help.  Also, I think cutting back a little on the potato, as I found it a little dry.  Might try again with a few modifications.

This recipe was so quick and easy. I used six eggs instead of the egg product and I used bacon instead of ham and green chili instead of the green pepper and onion. I used this for dinner and then froze the extras for later. It worked out wonderfully!

My first ever breakfast casserole! Several folks at work asked for the recipe today! I made some modifications after reading other reviewers mentioning too much potatoes or that it is a little bland in taste.
This recipe was doubled to 24 servings, & used 24 ounces of regular eggs. Only half of the recommended hash brown was used. (One  30-ounce Pkg). One 16-ounces of hot ground pork sausage (browned, drained, and fat absorbed with paper towels), diced browned but not burned bacon (8-9 strips), and enough diced baked ham to a total of 2-1/4 cups of meat. Red bell pepper and onions was sauteed lightly before mixing. Used 12-oz of hand-grated gruyere cheese, a package each of shredded sharp cheddar, mozzarella, and some Mexican 3 cheeses to a total of 4-cups of cheese. For additional flavor, 2-Tbsp of finely chopped fresh dill, and 5-Tbsp of finely chopped and well-drained "Del Monte-diced tomatoes with green chilies" was added. Baking time was 90 min or until middle is done using the tooth pick test.  Top with a package of shredded mozzarella cheese during the last 8-10 minutes of baking.

Bon Appetite :)

This is the my go-to recipe far the morning after a party! It can be altered to be vegetarian, just skip the ham & add more veggies, or extra meaty (with bacon & sausage). I love to make this with biscuits too.

My changes are nominal, I bake for a bit longer ~80 - 90 minutes covered and then for the last 5 minutes uncover & add cheese on top, cause you can never have enough cheese!

this is a winner!
