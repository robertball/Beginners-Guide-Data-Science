I was looking for a new way to use spam( a good way to stretch the food budget). This will definitely be a keeper! I did use a can of low fat spam cut into 8 slices. This took a little less time to cook seeing how the spam only needed to be browned in some non stick spray. There was not any pan drippings so I added a little butter to sauté the onions, water and then the mushrooms ( which I doubled, we are mushroom lovers). I also used the jarred beef gravy, but I used  two. My family was a little skeptical at first, but agreed we will be making it again. And the hubby requested two eggs for next time.

It was missing something, but I did enjoy it. I made my own Gravy, rather than the jar stuff, so the fault could be my own.

I was looking for a loco moco recipe after having it in Hawaii. This hit the spot for reminding me of that dish, and it’s a nice comfort food.
