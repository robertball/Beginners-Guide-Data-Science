The combo of flavors in this was excellent. I did find it needed more cheese and ended up using 8 ounces instead of 4. On that note I didn't see the point of using both grated and cubed cheese and used all shredded. The leek was a really nice addition. When you first pull it out of the oven it is a little loose so let it rest for 5 minutes before digging in.

Took longer to make sauce by quite a bit typical in my experience. I used chopped onions saut√©ed in butter rather than the leeks. I also added a bit of Marsala wine. Very good.
