Very good basic recipe.  I have two suggestions.  First I found you couldn't taste the garlic and onion. Next time I sauteed them before throwing them in. Second, the pasta soaks up all the broth especially if you have any leftovers.  I would add the pasta to each bowl as served.

I want to make this for a Lenten soup supper this week so I decided,to try it this evening.  I didn't have time for the slow cooker so I just made it in a large pot,  I read the comments before I began.  My critical husband & a visiting family friend thought it was delicious & to be added to our family staples.  To make the most of the favors in the ingredients I added things differently than given for the slow cooker.  First I sautéed the garlic & onion in about a tablespoon of olive oil.  I added the celery to this, then the crushed tomatoes; while these simmered, I added the carrots.   We have a deck garden of fresh herbs so I used them + dried for those I didn't have.  To the tomato mixture I added about 1-T-fresh Oregano, the dried thyme, black pepper, fresh parsley, & fresh spinach.  When this began to boil I added the vegetable broth, kidney beans, & remaining vegetables.  When these came to a slow boil, I added the macaroni using varied vegi colored elbow macaroni & salt.  When the pasta was cooked, we ate.  We topped the soup with the Parmesan as described & it was fantastic.  The favors were perfect for us.

Needs a little kick for my liking, however it's a great recipe. I normally don't review recipes if I make a change but the changes I made were after the soup was almost done. As another reviewer stated, there wasn't enough liquid to support the elbows so I keep them separate. Put them in the bowls then ladled the soup over. Also added the green Tabasco. Perfect! There is a review that says the recipe is unsafe because the kidney beans need to be cooked first. I wanted to point out that the recipe calls for canned kidney beans which are completely cooked before canning! Duh. Enjoy the soup everyone.

I've made this recipe twice already and it's quickly becoming a favorite to my girls that don't eat meat. I haven't found a need to change anything as it's great just the way it is. Thanks for sharing!

I'm not a vegetarian, but I liked this soup.  This is one slow cooker recipe that I will make again (and there aren't many).  Tasty and nutritious.

Very good basic veggie minestrone soup recipe. Add more veggies, chicken broth or “clean out your fridge”’with this one...so versatile. 
But please don’t give this a negative review because there’s not enough green chipotle jalapeño Tabasco spicy spice for your taste because this is MINESTRONE, not southwest chipotle bean soup!

I don’t believe this soup is a good candidate for a slower cooker tho. Definitely don’t need that much time. You can throw this together in under 30 min on the stove top. Why would anyone want to cook fresh veggies and pasta for 6-8 hours?! You’d have a big over cooked pot of mush...just sauté onions, garlic, celery, carrots in a couple TBLS of good olive oil, throw in your tomatoes, stir around for a couple minutes, add a couple small unpeeled cubed red potatoes, pasta, beans, broth,seasonings...everyone in the pot!...and cook at a medium boil for 15 min. Check for salt & pepper and That’s it! Delicious bowl of soup!

Frankly, I am shocked that something this easy to make can be so darn delicious.  I'm so glad I made a huge batch, so I could freeze the rest and have some later.  Even better the next day.

I prepared this soup for a Valentine's banquet at church as a last minute vegetarian main dish. It smells wonderful and tastes even better. It is so delicious that I just had to have a bowl for breakfast. I made two loaves of crusty french bread for dipping to go along beside it. It is definitely going to be a repeat recipe.

This is actually a little dull and I sautéed onions, etc., ahead of time to get every bit of flavor I could. Wanted to love this but didn't. That said it is satisfying enough and is providing an easy lunch as leftovers. But no one else in my family will revisit it.

This was really good. I also cooked it in a stock pot and used mini shells instead of elbows. It was almost bland so I added smoked chipotle Tabasco and it was super yummy. I also make my veg stock from scratch and add a lot of garlic to it, so I did not saute the garlic and onions like others suggested. I will totally make this again.

I'm one of those inexperienced 'cooks' that loves the idea of home made healthy foods but due to my schedule can rarely follow through. This recipe is healthy, hearty and unbelievably easy considering the outcome. The flavor is robust and the prep time minimal. I can take it to go for lunch, serve it over pasta for dinner and freeze it for both said options in a pinch. This will be an absolute staple in my very hectic schedule!

Bouncing off the ideas in the comments, I added tons of garlic, some red pepper flakes, and made sure to keep the pasta separate from the soup when storing.  It was a healthy, quick-to-prep meal.

Followed this recipe exactly except I cooked pasta separately and added it and the spinach to the soup about 10 mins before serving. I also used the Smokey Chipotle Tabasco as suggested by another reviewer and I truly believe that made the difference between just a good soup and a superior soup.  Made enough for two meals for hubby and I and enough to freeze for at least one more meal so very economical as well.  On my repeat list for meatless Mondays.  Thanks for posting.

I thought this was an excellent recipe with lots of flavor. I made a few minor adjustments, including cooking it with a parmesan rind. I've seen that done in other minestrone recipes, and I think that contributed to the flavor.

Very good and filling. We're not vegetarians so I used 4 cups of the vegetable broth and 2 cups of beef broth. I only put in 1 cup of frozen spinach and used a bag of frozen vegetables. I also used colored veggie pasta. 
Everything else I kept the same. 
I definitely will make it again.

This recipe was a hit.  I did it on the stove very low instead of the crock pot.  We found it very tasty.

Like some others, I sautéed my onion with garlic before adding to the crockpot.  I also left out the zucchini since I don't like it. I used more broth than the recipe calls for and added red pepper flakes for some heat.  This is a very hearty soup that fills you up and is great for gloomy days. It keeps well in the refrigerator so I can eat off of it all week for work lunches.  Fantastic recipe!

I also am not a vegetarian, But this was great for a cold day warm up. I haven't tried yet but my wife suggested cooking it with the rind of the Parmesan. I will try some of the suggestions to add a little kick to it.

Everyone loved this soup.  I couldn't fit the last step into the crockpot, so I switched to a bigger pot on the stove for the final step.  Served with a rustic, hearty bread, it is perfect for winter weather.

Delicious. Great for vegetarians and carnivores alike! Great flavor. The only thing I do differently is cook it in the pressure cooker and it's done in 15 minutes. Then I add the spinach, which wilts instantly and then I add the noodles that I cooked separately. (I've never put noodles in the pressure cooker, so to be safe, I cook them separately.) I've made this twice now for my family, parents and neighbors. Served with some crusty bread. It's just sooooo easy!  Everyone loves it!!

Good!  Requires the large crockpot. Could use some red pepper flakes for a bit more pizzaz.  Would also be good with spicy Italian sausage (prob. wouldn't add pepper flakes in this case).

This has become the go to soup for our family meals. Great by itself for a dinner or as a soup dish for larger occasions. We find it very hearty. Added 1 can of garbanzo beans and it adds to the dish protein content. On occasion I add small meatballs if we want a meat dish.

love this recipe it is simple to make and is not finicky about close measurement.

Absolutely delicious soup with things I always have on hand! I doubled the spices, sautéed veggies in olive oil/butter before adding to cooker and added a can of diced tomatoes. This is a keeper, thank you!

Great soup with great flexibility to tweak it and experiment with. I did change the recipe a bit because of what I had on hand. Used lentils instead of beans, added double the garlic, used real tomatoes instead of canned but only because I had some I needed to use up. I will use the can next time even though the fresh ones worked just as great. I did need to add tomato paste because of using the fresh tomato. I also omitted green beans and added an extra zucchini. Perhaps I shouldn't be rating this because I changed it so much but I truly believe with or without my changes, this is a great recipe. I'm not vegetarian and I still enjoyed it.

Very good minestrone! Even my husband, who isn't a big fan of veggies, loved it.  My kids couldn't get past the fact there was spinach in it and wouldn't even try it, but we adults loved it.

I have made this many times and love it.  I cook it slowly in large pot on top of stove for 2 1/2 hours.  I also add 3/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes.  (I freeze as much as I can as it allows me to always have it on hand.)

Took suggestion to saute the onions and garlic before putting in the slow cooker.  Also added 1/4 cup white wine when adding the spinach.  Got the highest compliments from my daughter!

I doubled the beans & tripled the pasta to make it heartier. Absolutely delicious! Definitely adding this to my 'regular' recipe list

This recipe is easy and delicious!   I'm a huge fan of minestrone soup and I do agree with some reviewers that it was missing a small 'something'. I added two tbsp of chili powder and a little Tabasco sauce...I don't know how much impact the Tabasco sauce really had, but the chili powder gave it the fuller flavour that it needed. It definitely tastes better if you slow cook it the full 6 hours and it's even better the next day!

Update:  I made this again but this time I used 4 cups of broth, 1 tsp each of dried parsley, thyme, and black pepper, 2 tsp of oregano and a bay leaf.  I also used a can of crushed tomatoes and a can of stewed tomatoes and 1 cup quinoa instead of noodles.  And pretty much an entire bunch of spinach because it cooks down so much.  So kept to the basic recipe but added more seasoning.  Loved it this way!

Original review from 3/24/14:  This isn't bad, it just lacks a lot of flavor.  There was too much liquid.  I'd cut it down to 4 cups and then add another 1/4 to 1/2 cup of pasta also.  The spinach is a really nice touch, but it needs a lot more seasoning.

This was good, I added Ro-tel tomatoes which made it a little spicy for my audience so I added extra macaroni. It seemed thin in taste a little, but I guess that just needs some tweaking. I also might add extra beans next time.

I made this recipe basically as is, except I prolonged the cooking time. I cooked it on low for 6 hours in a slow cooker, refrigerated it, then cooked for a second day for 4-5 hours on low and added a smoked ham shank.  I could have eaten it without meat, but my husband was grumbling a bit. The soup really condensed the next day and was thick and delicious. I also added smoked Tabasco chipotle seasoning as was recommended. With the meat addition and the garlic bread I was serving, I omitted the elbow pasta. Very happy with this recipe!!

Made almost exactly as stated. I did sauté the onions and garlic first and added the noodles to each bowl (more than 1/2 cup for the whole batch though) and it was wonderful.

This was super easy and very yummy. It's certainly better tasting and healthier than any canned soup you could buy. I subbed some of the veggies because I didn't have all of them, but that's the beauty of this recipe - you can put almost any vegetables in and it works. The whole family liked it and that's not an easy task.

I made this as written.  It was very good and made a lot of soup.  I didn't think it was life-altering, as some of the reviews seemed to imply, but it's a good, simple soup with plenty to put in the freezer for another day.

Maybe I chopped my veggies too big, but at 6 hours on low my veggies were no where near ready, so I had to do it another 2 hours on high. Also, I put about a tablespoon and a half of salt. Besides that, I followed the recipe exactly. It's not bad, but it's pretty bland. I won't make this one again.

This was an amazing vegetarian minestrone!  I made a few substitutions (added a can of garbanzo beans, omitted the green beans, zucchini and spinach, added asparagus).  The seasonings were just right, the flavor was amazing and my husband requested his serving without pasta and he ate two bowls!  I think I will hang onto this recipe as a great base for making soups in the future.

I needed a vegetarian soup to take to work for a soup lunch and I made the slow cooker vegetarian minestrone.  It was wonderful!!!  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I made a few changes.  I don't like kidney beans, so I used cannelloni beans and I added a can of black beans.  I also added 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary.  I used small shell pasta and a lot more of it; I cooked 1 1/2 cups for 6 minutes.  I added the zucchini 30 minutes before serving; it was perfectly cooked.  I will definitely make this again even though I'm not vegetarian.   Diane R.

We did it in the crock pot and it was delicious! I kept the pasta separate so it didn't soak up the broth, used chopped kale instead of spinach and left out the thyme and celery only because we didn't have any. I probably added a little more kosher salt than the recipe called for too.

Very easy lo-cal recipe that can even be used for a detox cleanse. I used all low or no salt products, making it in need of way more flavor! It's better to season with parmesan, hot sauce, spaghetti sauce, etc in each serving bowl than in the crock pot. Pasta is not necessary in that it adds a lot of calories and carbs and sucks up all the broth.

Pretty good recipe. We used some leftover frozen "stew veggies" instead of the green beans, and like the other reviewer, couldn't really taste the onion or garlic. Will try sauteeing them first when I make this again, or just using onion and garlic powder might add some flavor. I used low sodium broth (one quart) and water for the rest of the liquid, so we had to salt it a little too.

I thought this had too much of a tomato taste.  Made it last night on top of the stove because I was pressed for time.  If I make it again I'll try the crockpot.

Great basic recipe for  crockpot! I followed suggestions here to saute the onion and garlic to start, subbing with chicken broth ( sorry, it was all I had on hand), and adding pasta to each serving ...is my go to crockpot recipe....until I got an Instappt, that is. :)

The recipe is AWESOME! I have a three-4 quart slow cooker setup so I had to down size on the portions ingredients and directions however are EXCELLENT! 

I am a single man so I food preservation and storage while maintain quality are huge. I would recommend to anyone planning on not eating this immediately to cook the macaroni and spinach right before you intend to eat, this will give you that first day feeling.

I didn't do this the first time and my soup had turned into excellent baby food by the next day! I HATE WASTING FOOD! So i processed the soup and it is excellent nourishment for an infant.

Good, made as directed except I only used 5 cups of broth (that's all I had). The kids liked it too. It was plenty of soup to feed 4-6 people (with salad side dish).

Everyone loved it. Used frozen spinach instead of fresh. Used a can of white beans in tomato sauce because that's what we had.

I made this about a month ago and my family loved it. I added a few dashes of Tabasco to my own bowl just for a little kick. Can't go wrong with Tabasco.

Absolutely delicious!!!! A great fresh food delicious nutritional soup. I omitted the garlic because it disagrees with me. I also omitted the thyme because I didn’t have any. All else was made exactly as written. It was without a doubt the best vegetable and nutritional soup I have ever had. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.

I would describe this as “meh” at best. The spice mix was strange, overall soup had a vinegary flavor for some reason. I won’t be making this again.

LOVE IT!!!! I kicked up a little. I added a can of roasted tomatoes, and extra zucchini. I put the spinach in too soon (my bad). Yet it turned out so good that I was asked if I bought it from a restaurant. ????????. Oh, and I cooked it for way more than the suggested time. I hope y’all’s soup turned out as good as mine. Best part, no heartburn afterwards. That’s a major YAY!!!!

Excellent! Only thing i did WRONG was to add the elbow macaroni at the very beginning, so by the time the soup was done, the macaroni was pretty much DISSOLVED! No matter tho, tasted GREAT! Froze a batch for next time!

Very good and very easy.  Only changes, added more garlic and cooked pamesan cheese rind in it, then at end of cooking time diced it and added it back to soup (instead of using grated cheese).

I made this to take to a work night social gathering and it was a big hit. I added two cans of beans, one kidney and one cannelloni and used two cans of diced tomatoes rather than crushed. It was delicious and the leftovers were great for lunch.

I loved this soup! I cooked it in a large pot on the stove. I added the cooked pasta last and for an addition, I added 1/2 pound of cooked ground beef. It tasted like the soup at  Olive Garden!

I have been making a variation of this for years. For my version I use chicken broth instead of veggie broth, Rotel instead of plain tomatoes for some kick, I also use white kidney beans as well as the dark red and chick peas. otherwise its the same deliciousness.

Will definitely make this again.

I swapped the celery for two sliced rashers of bacon and a leek, used 200g of pasta which was slightly over cooked and did not soak up the broth contrary to other comments I read. I added a jar of the cheapest tomato pasta sauce I could buy and will make with only 1 L of water next time for a slightly thicker soup.

I found that 6 hours on low wasn't quite long enough, and next time, I'd definitely sautee the onions a little first.

Thought it came out perfectly delicious. Would have used another can of Kidney beans (personal preference), but everyone enjoyed it. Kept the noodle separate and combined them i each bowl, which I think helped keep the consistency on point.  Also, directions weren't as clear as they could be but nothing too difficult to figure out.

It was delicious. I made it in a Dutch oven and sautésd the onions and some of the other veggies first. I thought I th would give it more flavor. And it did.

Great soup! So easy to make! One of those recipes where you can just use what you have on hand and it still won't go wrong.  Inexpensive!  Healthy!  Will be staple in my household for sure!

Very good recipe. Tasty soup and really easy to put together. I cooked the vegetables a bit because I was short on time and was worried that it wouldn’t be done on time. I used frozen spinach as that was what was available. I also couldn’t find cannelini beans so I used 2 cans of navy beans. Also used small shells couldn’t find ditali pasta so next time I find ditali I’ll stock pile just for this soup. It made a large slowcooker full before the pasta and I will definitely make it again.

I did make a few changes. I substituted a couple of things with what I had in hand.  I did not have kidney beans so I ommited them.  I used canned zucchini because I did not have fresh.  Instead of elbow macaroni I used rotini.  I know these are a lot of changes but I don't think it affected the flavor.  I loved the balance of flavors.  I would like to make this again.

Decent basic recipe. I actually used chicken broth instead of veggie  and I used a lot more of it than recipe called for. I used basically the same ingredients but just eyeballed everything to my taste. I did sautee the garlic and onions in olive oil first. First day I made it, I was just okay. But I stuck it in fridge and found the flavor greatly increased over a couple days and I really liked it by day 2.  I will, in the future make it a couple days before I plan to serve it. It was a big hit with the family. We ate every bit of it and usually end up tossing the last of most soups I make cause everybody gets tired of it. Not this one. Ate it all.

Really tasty!  I followed suggestions from other reviewers and sauteed the onion and garlic before putting it in the slow cooker, and also cooked the pasta separately and added to the bowls before serving.  I cooked for  the full 8 hours.

This is one of the favorites at the firehouse. Although I usualy add Kale instead of spinach and double the beans. ( I'll use a mix of kidney and navy ) I have also added tiny turkey sausage meatballs. ( made small teaspoon size meatballs and lightly browned and added in for the last hour or so. ) Because of the additions ill  a little extra broth for soup consistency.

I made it this morning and just finished enjoying it! I didn’t add pasta but used 2 kinds of beans: red kidney & garbanzos. I’m doing WW Freestyle program so it was a 0 point soup. I added 1 T Parmesan cheese which is 1 point. I’m going to freeze some and eat it during the week.

I (sorta) halved the recipe for my daughter & I.  The result was more like a stew with an extra hearty proportion of vegetables v. broth.  We opted for no spinach, which wasn't really missed, ha!  She made corn bread complimenting this super delicious meal!  Will definitely make this again.

My go to minestrone recipe. I make it in the stove top and add a splash of red wine to the onion and garlic mix. Delish every time!

good starter recipe with tweaks to suit your tastes it can be very good, I substituted the can of crushed tomatoes with an chunky marinara sauce, big flavor boost so I still had the chunks of tomato but all the extra seasonings in the marinara were a hit.

Very tasty soup. Lots of flavor that blend together. This was the first time I ever  attempted minestrone. It always seemed like a lot  of work. But the inclusion  of the slow cooker convinced me to try it. I'm glad I did. The cheese was a nice addition at the end. I added 3 basil leaves and served this alongside the Hot Brushetta Dip (on this site).

This was soo good. I followed the recipe pretty much. But I cooked it in the stove over low heat instead of slow cooker. It tastes really good.

I didn't have zucchini so I substituted green beans, used minced garlic, spices to taste. This was fantastic a day later when the flavors really developed! Will definitely add to the rotation. Thanks

Was happy with this recipe with a few modifications to suit my tastes. I substituted cannellini beans for the green beans, added more garlic,  salt, and pepper. I also used 1 cup of mini penne pasta instead of elbow macaroni. I will make it again.

I will definitely make this again .... smells so good and is delicious.  I like my soups with lots of veggies, so I added a carrot and another small zucchini plus I added another half cup of the elbow macaroni at the end.  I might make half a recipe next time because it makes so much .... does anyone know if you can freeze it successfully?

This soup was really good. I did make a few changes. I didn't add spinach because I only like spinach raw. I added more beans instead. Also I only used canellini beans and no kidney beans. The last thing is I put the pasta in the slow cooker raw. A one pot meal means one pot right? It all worked out great. My husband loved it too.

I didn’t have green beans so I added both red and white kidney beans. Thought the broth was bland, needed to add additional chicken bullion (6) to the soup.

Very good, so easy, and even my kids ate it all! The only modification I did - I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used about 1/3 Tbsp of dried parsley.

I’ll definitely make this again, but may add a couple tablespoons of tomato past to increase the tomato taste and thicken the broth a bit.

This is a simple yet very tasty soup. I'm so glad I stumbled across it. I have made it a few times now with the only change being that I add about a pound of sausage. My husband and kids love it (and so do I)

I added another small can of stewed tomatoes and probably a little more veggies from each portion. For the macaroni I added three cups instead of 1 because I wanted some more substance. It is a great simple recipe.

Scrumptious! Definitely sauté the garlic, celery, carrots & onion. The only variance for me was adding a can of black beans & dishing it over spiral noodles instead of putting the noodles in the soup mixture. So good!

Good basic recipe. I always add lots more veggies and I like the spice combination of Sylvias Secret Seasoning, so I used that instead of the separate spices. I also like Better than Boullion Vegetable base, so I use that instead of broth.  Made a full crockpot, coworkers gobbled I think down quickly with most taking seconds and thirds.

Excellent soup!  I followed some suggestions here and sautéed the onions and garlic before adding to the crockpot.  Also added the pasta immediately before serving.  I took this to an office potluck and it got rave reviews!  Delicious and easy.

I did use more onion and garlic than called for in the original.  I felt it needed more flavor.  Also, I used chard rather than spinach.  It should have been cooked before adding to the soup.  Next time I would use spinach which would work better.  All around a good, hearty meal served with salad and crusty bread.

Loved the simplicity of this recipe in using the slow cooker and felt it was very good! If using homemade vegetable broth/stock as I did, you may need to add more salt, but it can be added to taste in individual servings anyway. I had to omit garlic and onion due to a dietary restriction and instead added an extra celery rib and carrot. I left kidney beans out of the slow cooker, but before serving I did make them in a separate pot with some of the soup for my husband. So, he at least had the soup with the majority of the ingredients (again…no garlic or onion for me) and enjoyed the soup! Too bad I just thought of this now, but tomorrow I’ll sauté some garlic and onion and add the soup and kidney beans to a pot. I have no doubt he’ll love this minestrone even more with the garlic and onion! Lastly, I’ve never had luck with cooking noodles in a soup because they tend to absorb too much liquid and become soggy if you consume leftovers the next day. So, I made the noodles separate for serving in individual bowls. That doesn’t break this recipe though as it’s definitely going into our rotation for a nice fall/winter soup we can both enjoy!

This was very good. I took other reviewers suggestions and sautéed the onion and garlic first. I also added extra elbow pasta to make it more hearty. I would also recommend chopping the spinach before adding it.

Very good flavor! However, a whole onion was WAY too much for my liking. Next time I will only do a 1/2 of one. I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth since I'm not vegetarian and wanted more flavor. Overall, an easy recipe I will make again!

I made this recipe exactly as written and loved it! Brought it to a potluck and guests raved, especially the vegetarian ones! I did not add any extra salt since many ingredients were canned and so had sodium added as part of the canning process. That was the only thing I omitted. I also kept the cooked pasta separate from the soup and added some to each bowl when being served/reheated as well as sauted the onions and cellery. This re-heats great and has the perfect, original consistency, even after freezing. Great recipe I'll be folding into my personal recipe book, planning to make again in the future as each serving is low carb, low fat, high protein, and very high in dietary fiber (18g/serving)!!

I added the uncooked pasta to the slow cooker on warm 1/2 hour prior to serving so it absorbs the broth flavors.  I usually add uncooked pasted to most recipies. It infuses more taste into the pasta rather then just being topped with some sauce.

I made this recipe as stated (with the exception of sautee of the garlic and onion before adding) in my slow cooker and it turned out perfect!  I had no issues with the macaroni soaking up the broth.  Thought it was good, and then after a couple of bites remembered to sprinkle on grated parmesan..mmm that made it even better!!

I loved this minestrone soup. My husband requested me to save this recipe and make it again. My kids were also in happy land eating this for dinner one night that we all had colds. I kept tasting it throughout the cooking process to see if I needed to add more salt and herbs. I did add more salt and oregano. Definitely a keeper. Thank you!

I added extra kidney beans, celery, and carrots. I also added red potatoes and used tomato sauce versus crushed. Turned out absolutely delicious!

I made this and it was pretty good. I used an Italian seasoning which added more flavor and I used uncooked pasta which soaked up a lot of the liquid. I like thicker soup. Makes 4 nice size dinners for 2.

Good recipe but too tomatoey. A 28 oz can is a lot of tomotoes and it  dominates the taste. I'd recommend a 14 oz can and make up the difference with more veggie stock.

This recipe is a keeper.  Changed the beans to fit the family's liking and added venison mild sausage. Little less noodles next time (will follow others that mention adding noodles to each serving) but over all very tasty!!!

Love this recipe. I make it all the time. I do use cabbage instead of spinach for variety. Serve with a crusty bread. Yummy.

Delicious and versatile. Don't skip Parmesan and a sprinkle of salt in your bowl.

So flavorful! It was so easy to chop everything up and the payoff was a completely tasty soup! This is definitely a favorite in our rotation.

I made this recipe for a potluck at work, and got many compliments.  Only change I made was to double the pasta.

Excellent recipe!  I couldn't help myself and had to add Italian Sausage to compliment all the great flavors which changed it from being a vegetarian dish...other than that addition, the recipe was followed as written and will become a staple in our household.

My wife and I love this recipe.  I would suggest adding more salt which brings out more of the great flavor.  Without the extra salt, it's a little bland.

I used slightly different veggie mixed based on what we like and what was in the fridge, but used the same basic recipe and it turned out nicely. My hubby loved getting his veggies in such a yummy way and though my young kids are not fans of Minestrone, I really enjoyed it as well.

Could have added more beans, probably not whole can though.
