I doubled this recipe. Mixing the sugar and the almond paste took a lot of unexpected work, my fingers were so cramped up. Eventhough I packed the coconut when I measured it, I had to add extra to make the egg whites less runny. I used a small cookie scoop to get a nice mound of coconut. They kind of fell apart on the sheet but I just reshaped them and they held their shape when baked. After all that I was very pleased with the end result. They turned a nice golden brown and didn't ooze the egg whites out the bottom. I couldn't stop eating them either. They are so addicting. The almond paste is secret ingredient in these. It's a good idea to put the mini chips in the macaroon rather than dipping them in chocolate, easier too. Good recipe to try if you like coconut and chocolate. I will make again, just will have to find a short-cut with the almond paste and sugar, maybe have my husband do it. :)

I mixed the chocolate chips in the mix as the recipe called for, but they didn't melt completely. I think it would be better to melt the chocolate chips first then drizzle it on top. I didn't really care for the way they came out.
