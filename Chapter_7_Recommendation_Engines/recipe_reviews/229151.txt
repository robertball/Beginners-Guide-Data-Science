My family seriously loved this recipe. I did make a short cut with the chicken due to my whole birds not thawing in time for when I was needing them. I doubled the batch (was feeding 8 people) and used a huge family size pack of chicken breasts (about 4.5lbs worth). Used very large red and green bell peppers for color and contrast. Sliced them verses diced purposely because I have a few in my family that doesn't like them (easier to spot and pull out). Then I mixed all ingredients together in a sprayed casserole dish and followed through with the baking process and occasionally stirred for even doneness. It made quite a bit of sauce. Which was fine, because each could adjust the amount of sauce they wanted on their plates with the choice of pasta or rice. Any leftover sauce will be poured over rice. However, there was no ketchup-y taste at all. I feel that the flavor was really good because of the vinegar, onions & bell peppers. Will totally make again. And for my non-loving cooked peppers and onion hubby, he totally enjoyed them. And that was a shocker!

I thought this recipe was ok.  It taste like a sweet and sour sauce a little.  I subbed boneless skinless chicken and yellow peppers.

Everyone, even my adult daughter who doesn't care for chicken cacciatore as well as picky 13 yo son, liked it. The only change I made was to used 4 cloves of fresh minced garlic, rather than garlic powder. Next time we will buy the actual pieces of chicken we want (skinless & boneless for lower fat & ease for the diners) rather than a whole chicken in order to save time on prep & to have exactly the mix of dark & light meat that we want.
