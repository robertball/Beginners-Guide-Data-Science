I loved how easy and quick this recipe was. Oh, and tasty too! especially the marinade.   The cilantro-mayonaise sauce was a little disappointing, though. Too salty and too much mayo. I think I'll try a variation based on sour cream next time.

Super, super spicy but tasty. I dumped the sauce when frying it and it turned out so spicy but good. I didn't make the cilantro sauce. We ate it in tacos with sour cream , cheese and lettuce.
