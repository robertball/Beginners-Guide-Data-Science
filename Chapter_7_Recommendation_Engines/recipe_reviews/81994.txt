If you don't like the name "Fish Eye Salad", at least keep an open mind and try it.  Remember, there is a WONDERFUL recipe for "Frog Eye Salad".  It's all in a name, isn't it?

My Grandma used to make a recipe similar to this, she would cook the tapioca, not add the gelatin and let cool.  She would then make the whipped cream with sugar, fold into the cooled tapioca mixture along with pineapple tidbits, colored mini marshmallows, chopped walnuts, and sliced bananas (add bananas just before serving).  This recipe brings back fond memories of a yummy holiday treat ! !

Yummy!  Makes a great church potluck salad.  I prefer letting the jello/tapioca mixture completely set before adding whipping cream. I liked the consistency better that way.

Yumm! I used a mixed fruit flavored jell-o packet, and if I had fresh sliced strawberries to mix in that would have made it even more delicious! I waited until the tapioca / jell-o mix had fully chilled before blending in the whipped cream.

Mistakenly used minute tapioca - makes a big glutinous mess.

Our Grandma used to call it fish eye salad!
I remember the grapes and  marshmallows. My kids (and me)
Went crazy for it. I looked for this recipe for years. 
Will make it soon.
