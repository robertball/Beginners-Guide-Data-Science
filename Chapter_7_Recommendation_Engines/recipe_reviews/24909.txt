I used this recipe as a base and took the advice of others to add some spices.  I added fresh chopped parsley, garlic powder, salt and pepper to the cheese/tuna mixture and then rolled the finished ball in more fresh parsley.  It made a pretty green ball when it was finished and ended up being a great Christmas party appetizer.  Next year I might try putting an ornament top with a string on it to make it look like an ornament.  The flavor was wonderful.

The first time I made this, we ate it within a few hours of preparation and I couldn't see why people liked it; I thought it was bland.  I sent it to work with my husband the next day and his coworkers not only devoured every drop, but they asked for the recipe!  I made it again and found that it tastes much better if you let it sit in the fridge overnight!

The cheese ball was good if  you add a tsp of accent seasoning, a pinch of salt and some black pepper.  It was sorta bland according to the recipe submitted but once you add the extras it turns it into a wonderful appeptizer.  I also recommend stirring it witha rubber spatula to make it very smooth.. chill it FIRST, then roll in pecan pieces.. It went very well at a party I threw!

I have made this before and I agree it is always a big hit..The greatest part is that most of the time you already have the ingredients..I have even rolled it in fresh parsley...

This recipe is easy and a big hit.  I have also made this by substituting the tuna with canned salomon and using green onion instaed of white for more color.

I've made this for two different social occasions and it's always gotten devoured. It's better when it can get to room temperature (not outside at a cold weather oyster roast!) but regardless it's super easy and SO GOOD! I like to make the mixture and give it a couple of hours for the onion flavor to meld with the cream cheese which really adds flavor. Then I'll add some salt and pepper to taste and refrigerate one last time before rolling in the nuts.

I've made this for years and always get rave reviews - even from those who hate tuna!  My original recipe calls for some horseradish and a little mayo - generally I just use tuna, cream cheese, onions and a dash or 2 of hot sauce - enjoy!

Delicious - added some italian seasoning to the mixture to give it some extra flavor - it was a hit.  Serve with celery sticks.

This is good and simple.  You have to like tuna to like this.  I did'nt make any changes.  We like it as is.

This was delicious.  I added some chopped parsley, garlic powder, Emeril's Essense, and salt and ground pepper.  I lined a small bowl with plastic wrap, added the mixture, rolled it up in the plastic, and refrigerated overnight.  Before serving as an appetizer with various snack crackers, I rolled the ball in more chopped parsley, then in chopped pecans.  Very attractive, and very tasty.

This is an excellent, easy recipe.  I made it for Chrismas, and doubled the batch for the crowd.  Everyone loved. For the added seasoning, I included Emeril's Essence. It added a great zest. I service with baby carrots, celery slices and good crackers.  Wonderful!

Tasty, simple, quick to fix, and healthy...  If you're fat-friendly.  I didn't bother with the rolling.  Just mixed it all together and chilled.

As a young child during the holidays, this was a staple in our house and one I looked forward to each year and I have continued making it for my own family to enjoy.  This particular recipe was somewhat bland so I returned to my original recipe of one 8 ounce package of cream cheese, (2) 5 ounce cans of tuna packed in water, a teaspoon of liquid smoke, teaspoon of garlic powder, 3 to 4 green onion "tops" and then rolled in walnuts versus pecans.  The walnuts stand up to the taste of the tuna better than pecans which have a more delicate flavor.  NOTE:  Make it a day ahead of time so the flavors have a chance to blend.
Thanks Glenda for sharing!

I made my version of the TUNA BALL by doing a mash-up/hybrid recipe based on the "Barbie's Tuna Salad" recipe on this site. I just basically followed the BTS recipe and added cream cheese. I shaped the ball and wrapped it in plastic wrap and let it sit overnight. It was amazing. Everyone raved about my curry tuna ball at my Christmas party. It was actually the preferred over the expensive smoked salmon pate I made, much to my surprise.

We enjoyed this very much. It was easy to make and everyone liked it. It has a creamy and delicate tuna and onion flavor (some describe it as bland) but I thought it was perfect as not all dishes need to be spiced out. I did add salt to taste and chilled overnight for the flavors to develope and too it made it easier to roll. I did add chop parsley to the outside for a pop of WoW color. I think if you want a more pronounced tuna flavor using tuna packed in oil may give that. I also used the 1/3 fat cream cheese and no one noticed. Great appetizer!

I got the inspiration for the tuna ball I made from this recipe.  Because of the comments from other reviewers regarding spices, I decided to dispense with the chopped onion and instead added an envelope of Lipton onion soup mix. So glad I did because it was excellent!  I still rolled it in pecan but first added a layer of parsley.  Really quick and tasty recipe.

I just made this with light cream cheese, and added celery and Worcestershire to it.  I also used green onions.  A little lemon zest gave it some zip.  I love it.

My boyfriend loved this and almost ate the whole thing and he is not even fond of tuna...he requested me to make more.  My coworker would make this and bring it to work and I lost the recipe.  I am glad it was on the website. I always put less of the liquid smoke the taste is very strong for me.

I love simple recipes that are totally wonderful - and this is one of those. A joy to make and even better to eat. 5 stars as is. I actually made it as a made it as a main course with crackers and my husband loved it. Also good with green onion, onion salt, and lemon juice added. I agree with other reviewers that it works with reduced fat/neufchatel cheese, which is easier to blend. I can't wait to try this out at a party. One caveat: children don't seem to like it very much.

This recipe was quick, easy and seemed well liked by my quests. I did not make it in a ball though, just put it in a bowl with nuts sprinkled on bottom and top. It was too.

This recipe has been in my husband's  family for at least 30 yrs.  We make it a little differently by omitting the onion and adding 1 Tbsp. of Horseradish mustard and 1 tsp. salt.  It is the best!!

WOW!  I realize 90 minutes before a party that I was supposed to bring an appetizer.  I found this recipe and was good to go in just a few minutes.  I didn't have time to let it chill, so I just put it in a small bowl and served it as a dip rather than a ball!  Yummy!

EASY! Made it for a girls night in party, everyone loved it. I could have done with a little less parsley but that didn't bother anyone else. I made the cored the night before and refrigerated, evening of is when I added the toppings.

Have made this Tuna Ball many many times and it's always a hit. I tried it because someone in an earlier review said that even those who dislike tuna could not resist it. They were correct.  The only change I made was to add 1 teaspoon of Liquid Smoke and salt to taste. Salt really enhances the flavors of the other ingredients. I like to make it a day earlier than I am serving it although it's hard to resist when I first make it.

Good base to start with.  I add dry ranch dressing mix to help give it some extra flavor and a couple Tablespoons of miracle whip.  Yum!

This is a good recipe base and nice centerpiece. 
When making for my husband's family occasions, they like when we add diced serranos/jalepenos, and diced black olives, minced cilantro and salt and pepper. Always gets devoured.

This sounded delightfully odd!  I wasn't sure about cream cheese & tuna together but it is quite tasty!  I accidentally bought sliced almonds instead of pecans but it still gave it a nice crunch. I'm definitely tucking this one away for my next party.  Thanks!

Not a lot of flavor...and very stiff.  To serve with crackers, bring to room temp..or maybe add mayo or sour cream?  Definitely will make again, but with minor mods.  I ate this with crackers as a meal.

Good recipe base that can be modified in different ways.  I added about 1 TB of liquid smoke.  This was to make it a little closer to a dip my family makes with smoked salmon.  I really think it improved it (I tried it before and after the addition).  It wasn't a huge hit at my party (I'm only guessing that b/c no one raved and there was plenty left over). I really enjoyed it though and thought it would be great on a bagel the next morning (too lazy to run out for bagels, I ended up just eating it on crackers for breakfast--yum!).

I had a similar recipe years ago, so this one helped me remember.  I think the other one had a TBS of sherry, but I forgot to add that.  Did add some grated cheese per the other recipe and some Italian spice blend per other reviewers.  Came out great!

Delicious!  Added 1/4 cup of mayonnaise to make it easier to blend the ingredients, and also added some onion & garlic powder to taste. I also used the optional pecans to roll the ball in to coat it.

Yummy! I love my dip and it is nice to get some protein in while satisfying my dip fix. Nice for a snack, lunch or entertaining. I like that you can spice it up or not as suits you and that the ingredients are usually on hand. Thanks for the great recipe!

It was a star as written but 5 star after adding a couple of things.  I added minced red and yellow bell peppers, garlic powder, parsley, Badia complete seasoning and cayenne pepper.  I served on Dijon mustard crostinis at a pot luck.  To help keep its shape, I made it a couple of hours ahead of the event.  I shaped it into a ball using plastic wrap and put it in the freezer for 1 hr.  I then rolled it in the nut mixture and put it in the frig.  When served it was soft enough to cut but still held its shape.  Very good.

What a hit! Followed the recipe and some suggestions. Let it chill in the refrigerator for about 24 hours and rolled in parsley before serving. None left:)
