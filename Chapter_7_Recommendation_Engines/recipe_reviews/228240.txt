When made correctly this dish is delicious.  If you are considering adding it to your dinner rotation, then I highly recommend taking a trip to your local Asian supermarket.  There you will find ingredients and tools to make this perfect every time.  At the Asian supermarket you should buy your gochujang, stone bowls, sticky rice, chili oil, and their thicker soy sauce made for soups.

Everything is made up ahead of time.  I use:  bean sprouts, shredded carrot that I mix with the thicker soy sauce, chicken tossed in the same sauce, steamed and pressed spinach tossed in chili oil, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, and an egg, but you can add different veggies if you prefer.  I put my stone bowls in a warm oven while I cook my sticky rice in my rice cooker.  The sticky rice gets really crunchy in the stone bowl and is well worth the effort.  Once it's done, I take the bowls out and place on a hot burner (be careful of heat because the bowl can crack).  I add the sticky rice to the bottom with chili oil and cook for five minutes.  Continue to stir so it doesn't burn and occasionally flick water into the bowl to get that crunch. When that is finished, I add the other ingredients around the bowl like a sliced pie would appear.  Lastly I cook the egg for the top, add salt and pepper to it and place it on top.  Undercook the egg as it will continue to cook in the very hot bowl.  I cut my gochujang with sesame oil to thin it out a bit.  This is a family favorite and healthy too.

Great recipe, my mother used to make this when I was younger.  The only thing I changed was I added some yellow pickled radish and wrapped it in seaweed.  yummy

It's a great recipe and also authentic.  The sauce for bibimbap could be a key to make the dish delicious.

This is excellent, very much like the real thing.  I used pork marinated and cooked in Korean Barbeque sauce.

After the number of very positive reviews,  I was disappointed at how bland this dish was. My wife and our brunch guests had the same response.  I followed the recipe very carefully.

LOVE! Made a few small changes: Used Sriracha instead of the Korean hot pepper paste, added pickled radish on top, seasoned the beef with salt and red chili flakes while cooking, omitted the sesame oil and used a lot more spinach than "one bunch." This was great!

Used to love the stone bowl bibimbap places when I lived in Korea and got a craving for it, this is a great recipe I also add bean sprouts, and sometimes make it with chicken

I added had pickled vegetables, notably bean sprouts and cucumbers in vinegar with sugar.  This added a lot of "zip" to the recipe. Also, be careful not to overcook the egg. You want the egg to be nice and runny.

This recipe is delicious as is but is also easy to alter to your taste. You can easily change the meat and use pork or even chicken although I prefer beef. The veggies are easy to add or substitute to your taste or what you have on hand. I like to add mushrooms and have substituted kale for the spinach when I was out and it worked well. My whole family loves it, even my 7 year old who asked for seconds tonight and ate it all up.

Super tasty! The store didn't have the Korean chili paste from the recipe so ended up getting ground fresh chili paste instead. Info i found about the Korean paste sounds like it had more flavors than just the paste so ended up doing a mix of close to 50/50, with bragg's liquid aminos. Came out pretty spicy, but can make it milder with more aminos depending on heat wanted.

This recipe of bimbimbop is excellent. The egg was nice and runny. The cucumber and carrots crunchy. And the spicy sauce great! Would love to make it again. This time with beef not raw tuna.

The only thing I would do different is find some way to season the rice. I personally don't like the taste of plain rice. The toppings we're perfect!

I don't have a Korean/Asian market near me, so I was limited to bibigo-brand marinade and gochujang sauce. This is my first time making bibimbap from scratch and I'm impressed it's so quick to make after you slice up the veggies. I also added slivers of shitake mushroom to mine, in an attempt to add a little more veggie while substituting some of the beef. Tasted great!

It’s kinda magical how all the puzzle pieces in this recipe fit together. I used a paper towel to push and then squeeze out the liquid from the spinach. About 3 rounds of wringing out the paper towel and repeating. This allows the spinach to absorb the soy sauce. They become the perfect soy pop. I didn’t need to add any extra gochujang because there was plenty on the matchstick veggies. It’s worth all the chopping!

Delicious! This was my first time making this and it was a hit. My husband bragged about it to our friends for days afterward. Since I had ground beef on hand, I used the 'Easy Korean Ground Beef Bowl' recipe from here for the meat mixture, then followed the rest of this Bibimbap recipe as written.  This was restaurant worthy and I will definitely be making this again.

I didn't have thin sliced beef so used ground meat but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was the best homemade bibimbap so far! Cooking cucumbers and carrots made the difference. Thanks!

my family  enjoyed it.  I marinated the beef in a Korean sauce I bought at the market, which made the beef delicious.  I had my family make their own bowls so everyone was happy with the ingredients-I added fresh bean sprouts which was added a great crunch.  We did carrots and zucchini instead of cucumbers.   We will definitely make it again.

SO good.  When I was working downtown, there was this little Korean BBQ that I'd visit for lunch and get bibimbap... I have been craving it lately, and found this recipe.  It tastes JUST LIKE the bibimbap I would order.  

Use purple rice for a fun color splash!  I didn't have any gochujang, so I used srirarcha.... worked PERFECTLY!  

THe only reason I only gave it four stars is because the teens weren't totally impressed with it, ....more for me :D!

I made this for myself for lunch and got four servings out of it just like the recipe said. For a broke retail worker, that's phenomenal! Except for the meat, ingredients were cheap and the meal is very filling.

I will make some changes next time I make it. My meat was a bit bland so I plan on using a bulgogi sauce when cooking the meat, or maybe just marinating it overnight.

The cucumber carrot mixture was the best part of the whole dish; I could just make that and munch on it and be satisfied with such a tasty snack!

This dish is fantastic! I followed the recipe to the letter and it always turns out delicious. I'm a novice in the kitchen so it takes me a bit longer to make than they estimated, but I don't mind because it's totally worth it.

I made it last night and it was really good.  It is just how I remember it from a local restaurant that closed where we live in the Northern tip of California.  I will try it again and cook the egg less.  I did not have cucumber so I used peeled zucchini and it was fine.  To save some dish washing I think I would cook the egg first and keep it warm in the oven and then start the recipe as it is written using the already oiled egg pan.

I love the gochujang to coat the veggies. Next time I make this I will go to the Asian market to get the shaved beef. My wife wanted her egg poached but I love the runny egg yoke to help soften the spice. 

My wife said this is a definite do-over.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and it was so tasty! The only difference is that I used brown rice. I will definitely make it again!

Really good.  Too spicy as written for my kids so I put the sauce on the side.

Easy to make and really enjoyed the flavor.  We did season meat with salt, pepper and soy soy sauces just to add more flavor.

I used sirracha but will buy gochujang the next time I'm at the Asian Mart.  It was good with that as a substitute.  My matchstick cutting skills are marginal so I may try to just shred the carrots in my Vitamix the next time.  All in all. . .a tasty way to get vegetables in.

My family likes this a lot. Had to avoid the mushrooms since my son doesn't like them. It is best not to overcook the beef.
