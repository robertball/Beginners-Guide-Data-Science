I had left over cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving I needed to use up and this was a great way to do it! So, obviously i didn't make the filling and can't say how that turned out. I did add the orange zest to the cranberry sauce and the orange flavor is just right. I did a double batch and did one as the wreaths and the other rolled up like cinnamon rolls. Both worked well. I only had half the amount of evaporated milk but used whole for the rest and it was fine. Next time I will try using orange juice instead of Vanilla in the frosting for an orange flavor. Don't be afraid of the flour on the counter top. You don't want a thick layer but if there isn't enough flour it's not going to be very easy to fold or roll the dough. The recipe says it makes a "thick batter". They mean "soft dough" so if using a mixer use the bread hooks at least once you start to add the final flour.

Perfect for the holidays! I love how these come together. They look so impressive when they're done, like a lot more time and effort went into them. I brought these in to work and they were gone in under 10 minutes!  I made the recipe exactly as written. The only thing I might change next time is to use a bit less orange peel.  Make sure you chop the cranberries really fine. It'll make it easier to spread the filling. For the icing, I used vanilla-nut extract. Nice combo of flavors!

This was an adventure!  First- I was out of AP flour, but since I have been dabbling in gluten free baking I had some rice flour on hand.  I subbed that for the AP flour, and it resulted in a lovely dough, but one that did not rise, and also there was no way I was folding it without it cracking.  Second- in a strange twist, I had no oranges (when I almost always have them) but I did have Cointreau (when I almost never have liquor)...so I subbed that in for the orange.  Those were my only ingredient changes.  After a rather comical couple of minutes trying to chop the rollie-pollie cranberries, I put them in my blender to chop them.  I was careful to pulse until finely chopped, but not completely mashed.  Now I was at a loss as to what to do with my dough.  Ultimately, I rolled it into balls, flattened the balls into rounds, then spread some cranberry filling on half the rounds and topped with the remaining rounds.  I crimped them together, brushed with an egg wash and baked them.  Then I topped them with the frosting, which I added a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract to in addition to the vanilla.  These turned out incredibly, amazingly good- kind of like a super fancy Pop-Tart!  I have every intention of making these again the proper way, but I am so happy I was able to turn what could have been a failure into a delectable success.  I do believe when I make this again, I will still sub the Cointreau for the orange- it gives such a lovely depth of flavor.  Overall, a must try!!!

These were really good. I do think that next time I make these I will add a few tablespoons of orange juice to the cranberry filling to make it more sauce-like instead of dry.  With no liquid in the filling it didn't really "spread" well.  I also will roll them up and slice them like a cinnamon roll instead of the wreath shape.  With young children, time is precious!!  They were delicious.  I will definitely make them again!!!

These took a bit of time, but were well worth it in the end! Every part of it tasted wonderful! The bread was light and the twist was beautiful to look at. I skipped the icing and they were sweet enough with out them. Because of where I live I had to use dried cranberries, which I added some liquid to and allowed to soak while I made the dough (also had to skip the oranges, though I think it would only add another wonderful dimension to the taste!) I wasn't sure putting the dough in the fridge would let it rise, but it did! Kids, hubby, and company all loved them!!

I read every review before I started. You were all very helpful. Surprise! The dough does rise in the refrigerator. I would recommend proofing the yeast. If the milk mixture is too hot, you'll waste time and ingredients. (Like I did.) Do use the bread hooks. Cranberries are not available where I'm based, so I used a one cup jar of cranberry sauce, and added one teaspoon of orange zest and 1/4 cup of sugar. To answer Kate's question.... yes, you fold it like a brochure, so there is one layer on the bottom and two layers that overlap on top. They turn out just fine! This is a very nice holiday breakfast bread.

Delicious!  I made these with  a whole wheat dough.  I cooked the cranberries with honey and grated orange peel until it looked like the juice had evaporated.  These were so good that I didn't want to frost them!  These are my newest Christmas tradition!

Came out great. I put the cranberries in the food processes instead of chopping. Much quicker easier and came out perfect sized. I refrigerated the dough for 3 hours. And proofed next to the warm oven for about half hour. I had to triple the cranberry concoction and glad I did because one batch would not have been enough for the amount of dough. The directions for this recipe could have been t together better but overall great recipe.

These take some skill.  Make sure you use enough flour so the dough doesn't stick to the surface or the rolling pin.  Also I guess they brushed it with butter before baking since mine looked dry when they came out of the oven and not shiny like the picture.  HOWEVER these were yummy!  I definitely enjoyed making them and would make them again now that I've learned a thing or two!

They look gorgeous on the desert table but not s yummy in the tummy, most of my guest didnt finish it as it was to doughy and the cranberry filling lack a little taste . To Bitter. With a little tweaking next year these will be a hit.

This recipe was amazing! The bread was perfect. The amount of sweetness with the cranberry was perfect. My family absolutely loved these! They will be a holiday tradition for us now.

Very tasty and very easy to make. They were best fresh out of the oven and still warm. My icing was a little runny. Next time I make them I think I will try to make it thicker so the bun is not soaked in it but just garnished instead.

I just made this recipe & they came out great.  Il made no substitutions,followed the recipe exactly.  I was a little nervous,as I had never done a cold rise of yeast,but it worked fine.  Very impressive looking  and tasting.

These wreaths turned out beautifully.  I didn't want to sit and chop the cranberries by hand, and I sure didn't want to use the Cuisinart to chop such a small amount.  I had just finished using my nut grinder to chop up walnuts for a Christmas cookie recipe, so I ran the cranberries thru the nut grinder.  It's just a cheap manual type but it did a beautiful job on the berries.  Now I'll clean it on the top rack of the dishwasher and put it away until next year.
