I will be the first to say this was the perfect pie crust for a awesome pumpkin pie this thanksgiving! I LOVE this completely healthy pie crust and its definitely my new go-to recipe for my future pies. I don't really get the 21 tablespoons of flour at the end of the ingredients list; probably just a typo for 2 tbsp. of flour so don't forget that! I will upload a picture next time, I cut into the pie too early! Thank you so much Misty for sharing! :)

I don't use shortening so I used butter.  This was good in that nobody said, "What is different?" But it isn't the best pie crust out there.

Like the creator of this recipe, I tried for years to find a pie crust recipe that was truly whole wheat.  While some crusts came out okay, this was the first one that had some flake to it — it’s delicious.  I did refrigerate the dough for at least an hour before rolling it out, which I believe is one reason it rolled out more easily than any crust I’ve made in the past.  I made a whole-wheat crust, very low sugar tart cherry pie at Thanksgiving, as I always do, using this recipe, and it was the best ever.  Making another one for Christmas!

I made this in my food processor. My pie plates are large and I doubled the recipe twice to make one large pie. I used shortening cut into pieces and put in freezer prior to using and ice water. It took 4 tbsp of water for the dough to come together.  I let the dough rest, but still found it hard to roll. Usually I just substitute whole wheat flour for my regular pie recipe which generally turns out fine, but   I was interested to see how the gluten affected the texture of this crust. This wasn't a flakey crust maybe because of the gluten.
