Instead of dicing, I sliced the potatoes and boiled them just a little so that they were still firm. When adding other ingredients, I didn't mash them, because I didn't want a mashed potato casserole.. still wanted them chunky. I think boiling time would solve the soupy issue. I used cream of potato instead of cream of chicken, a little milk, and added pinch of salt, pepper, garlic, oregano, and basil. I used mozzarella and sharp cheddar cheese. Maybe I created my own recipe lol. This is definitely a recipe that needs tailoring according to your own personal taste.

This was easy to make and a nice change. The potatoes turn out very creamy and have a lot of flavor.

I've made this recipe before using frozen hash browns and it was always one of my favorites.  This recipe using mashed potatoes ruined the consistency.  I served it for company and was very embarassed how soupy it turned out.  I would not make this again.

my husband thought it was awesome.  Although I added some olive oil about 2 tsps and I also added a large garlic clove.  That helped with the flavor.

This was sooooo good however I made some changes.  I used frozen southern hash browns that I heated in the microwave until the chill was off of them.  I also did not add chopped onion and added almost a whole small container of sour cream.  I will make this again.

This was ok.  I needed a cheesy potato recipe that didn't take too long and this one sounded good.  I liked the idea of the chicken soup.  I'll probably add some garlic salt to the mix next time for more flavor.

This was only okay to me.  I was expecting a stronger flavor, but it was more subtle than I preferred.

While it takes a bit of time to prepare, if you have the time, it's worth it.  Very nice subtle flavour that compliments many dishes.  I scallop the potatoes instead of mashing them and omit the sour cream.

Good Recipe! Loved the sauteed onions.  Everyone enjoyed it.  I had 9 potatoes, so I decided to throw an extra in since some reviews said the recipe was too wet, but ours turned out a tad dry so I think the amounts would be just right how the recipe is written.  Make sure you bake it enough to get a crunchy top, That was the best part! I would make this recipe again

When I make this recipe I save time by using Potatoes O'Brien since it already has diced onions and peppers mixed in. My casserole is always finished, people enjoy it...and easy to make.

Wow this was the best mashed potatoes I have ever had.  I made it for company one night and they loved it too.  Definately will be making this again.

Not exactly what I had hoped for.  It was very runny and had a weird taste to it.  My friend uses this same recipe, but boils the potatoes with the skins on them until tender, then cuts them into quarters and blends in the other ingredients.  I'll try that next time.

I felt it was misssing something...do not know what.  My boyfriend loved it!!  Said it was the same filling as a potato cheese perogi.  I liked it, but won't be making it again, unless the boyfriend requests it.

I loved this recipe. I read some of the other reviews, so I chose to add some spice of my own. I didn't measure or anything, but I threw in some dried chilli peppers and some cayenne pepper along with the fried onion and I loved how it turned out. I also didn't have any cream of chicken soup, so I added cream of celery instead. Very easy to make and tastes great!

I gave this recipe 5 stars!  I really enjoyed it.  As far as wanting a little more flavor, which I didn't think it needed much, add a little of your favorite seasonings to spice it up.  This is defintely a keeper in my house!

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a hit.  My husband does not care for potatoes.  However, he does request this recipe.  I am the only one in the family who likes onion, so I only use about 1/4 of the onion.

I don't like peeling potatos, but this recipe was worth it! I used cream of mushroom because I didn't have any cream of chicken in the house, but it was still very tasty. They made very good leftovers too!!

I really didn't care for this dish.  The onion
was too strong and overpowering.
I have had much better potato casserole dishes.

Why go to the hassle of peeling and cooking potatoes?!! Use a 2lb bag of Frozen cubed/diced Potatoes. Ore Ida is a Great brand with or without the peppers & onions. (I myself, saute a small vidalia onion finally chopped in a little butter until it's opaque) I also use the Cream of Chicken mixed with 8 oz. of Sour Cream. I use 2 cups of Sharp Cheddar Cheese=reserving some for the top. I also have added 1 cup of cubed/diced ham, 6-8 slices of crumbled Bacon, 1 roll of sausage browned/drained for a little more flavor. A little salt & pepper to taste. Mix it all together & put in a well-greased 9 x 11 dish. Cover with foil & back 45 - 50 min. Remove foil & cook another 10-15 min. till brown & bubbly! This recipe will give you GREAT Reviews! It's always a hit when I serve it.

It was so good. I can't rave enough. I was hesitant putting cream of chicken in my potatoes but it was perfect and the flavor is so good... perfect comfort food. I followed the recipe as written. I wouldn't want to change a thing..thank you for posting this dish..

It was pretty tasty and really easy...but I'm not a fan of whipped potatoes and that's pretty much what this turned into...It was more like baked potato soup.

I thought this was good, my 7 year old actually ate them(He doesn't eat mashed potatoes) Fiance said they were just okay.  I would definately make this again mostly because my son will eat this.

Made this for an anniversary party & everyone loved it. It was a little runny...but firmed up as it cooled.  Tasted like pierogis with fried onions...but without the pierogi shell. Will make again DEFINITELY.

OK recipe. Lacked flavor. Would recommend adding more cheese and possibly garlic salt, bacon bits, or fried onions.
