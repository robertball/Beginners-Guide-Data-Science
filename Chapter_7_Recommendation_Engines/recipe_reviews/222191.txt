What a delicious recipe! My husband, kids and I loved this lamb. Very tasty and so juicy. I highly recommend this recipe for those who like Moroccan style stews and lamb. I didn't have lamb chops only shoulder. I followed the recipe and pulled the lamb meat with a fork. This is now a family favorite!

We've made this a few times, and its excellent. We've used different cuts of lamb, from shoulder, to leg and they have all worked excellently. We've also done this recipe once in the slow-cooker/crockpot and with a longer cooking time, it comes out super tender!

This was great. The pomegranate juice inspired me to take a cue from Persian cuisine, so when preparing the braising sauce I (as the boss of my sauce) added cloves, a pinch of dried ginger and some Turkish pomegranate syrup. At the end, when making the reduction  I added some more spices and salt to taste and splashed in some Merlot before boiling it down. I had thought the meat needed to be in just one layer in the oven, but it cooked down so much I wished that I had cooked more.  

@Chef John, you should start experimenting with pomegranate syrup!

My mother-in-law made this for Christmas dinner a couple of years ago, using a leg of lamb instead of chops. It was fantastic, and so festive with the pomegranate seeds. I need to have this again!

This was a fantastic recipe -- very rich and flavorful with an appealing complement of flavors. The presentation was equally wonderful. I must offer my compliments on the recipe instructions, as well. Very clearly, concisely written, super easy to follow and accurate to the minute, to the letter. Thanks so much for sharing this!

Wow! The only thing I would do differently is start earlier because we were drooling all over the kitchen waiting for this dish to be done!  I used an entire head of garlic (why not?) I used fresh juiced poms (lucky me - just happened to have them) and i forgot all about the honey at the end , again, because we were so impatient.  I thickened the sauce with a tiny bit of cornstarch (also because of impatience) and forgot all about the pumpkin seeds too.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I'll try the details. But for now, there is not one tiny scrap left.  The mint and the rosemary with the pomegranate  was a magical and aromatic combo. 
I served it with a side of couscous and  yellow lentils, roasted yukon golds with dill and tabouli salad - not bad for a school night ;-)

oh lord, this is fabulous Easter dinner. The lamb came out moist and tender, the onions/garlic brought out the savory quality of the meat.  the rosemary cut the gaminess of the lamb and the mint cut the acidity of the sauce. I admit, I was doubtful of combining the rosemary and mint but the refreshment of the herbs played nicely with the other ingredients, and yes, the aged balsamic vinegar is not to be skimped on, get the good stuff, it's worth it. The sauce overall was  insanely sweet, I recommend a very savory side dish (e.g.:cheesy potatoes) to go with it. This medley of sweet and meaty art is now one of my  family's favorite dinners.

This was falling off the bone and delicious.  I picked up the PomWonderful juice and later realized that it was their pomegranate/cherry juice rather than straight pomegranate.  Did not matter, it was fabulous.  I made it exactly as the recipe shows.  I garnished with the pumpkin seeds since those were easy to buy a few of, but left off the pomegranate seeds since I did not want to deal with it.  I made this for a new beau and he was blown away.  I also turned the remaining juice into the best pom/cherry vodka martini.  Yum!

In preparation for my ladies' lunch gourmet, I prepared this for my husband, who does not like lamb.  He raved and exclaimed about how excellent it was!!!  He suggested that asparagus and twice baked potatoes be the sides.  What would others suggest for sides, appetizers, soup or salad, and dessert?

I made this for my girldfriend's birthday dinner and it was a hit. Her friend who wasn't a fan of lamb couldn't believe how much she loved it! So simple and easy to make, just like Chef John says in the video, you cant mess this recipe up.

Followed the recipe, except roasting 30min less and the meat was so tender that it almost melted apart. A perfect entertaining meal for fall/winter. Served with roasted asparagus, onions and mushrooms. Pairs well with a nice Syrah. There were no leftovers from kids and adults alike.

I stuck to the recipe but added 1 hour of cooking because I had an extra pound of meat, and it was like butter. Perfect combination of flavors. I always get excited about trying another Chef John recipe and this did not disappoint.

Marvelous! The flavors sang a beautiful melody. I like it when my  the meat falls from the bone though. These were tender but they didnt fall of the bone. Next time I will make everything exactly the same (I followed the recipe exactly) but I will use my slow cooker on low for a bit longer to get that desired texture and update on that.

This is an excellent recipe! I did not have mint and I left out the pomegranate seeds and the honey at the end and it turned out great. I will definitely make this often.

I wasn't going to make this at first because the recipe said Dutch oven and I don't own one. Then I realized that all you need is a big pan with a lid and obviously, this could be done in a slow cooker as well!

The lamb was perfect and perfectly complemented by the sauce.  I left out the honey in the sauce because it was plenty sweet for us.  I served it with roasted acorn squash and green salad.  Everyone loved it!

Used lamb leg cut into cutlets. Used cranberries and juice as pomegranites out of season at this time.
It was very tasty with or without the sauce!
I would make it again using black currants or black berries instead of pomegranites!
