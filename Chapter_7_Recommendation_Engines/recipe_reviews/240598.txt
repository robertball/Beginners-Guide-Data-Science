My mother was also making these in the 70's.  I think I could eat the whole pan back then.  Not sure why the photo is of traditional cinnamon rolls.  The whole point of Helter Skelter rolls is that you can make the most luscious, mouth-watering caramel rolls ever without the hassle of rolling, cutting, etc.
