Most excellent fudge! Very smooth and creamy! I did make a few changes though. I added a large spoonful of peanut butter and used walnuts instead.

I have made this fudge about 3 or 4 times.  My 8 yr. old son thinks it's the best in the whole world!!!  Freezes really well, and I haven't muffed it up even ONCE!  :)  I'd rate it a 10 out of 10!

This fudge is very creamy. For those not fond of fudge, like myself, will enjoy this recipe as it doesn't leave that dry after taste some fudge can leave. Very simple to make, I will use this recipe as a base for trying other flavored chips. And I omitted the nuts, which for those that add it could change texture/creamy quality. I am making this again...I also freezed some fudge, don't know how it tastes after being frozen, but I hope the same!

YUM!  Easy to make and very tasty!  I would suggest buttering the foil before putting the fudge in it.  It makes it much easier to peel the foil off!

Dangerously good.  My second time ever making fudge and this method is simple.  I will never look for another fudge recipe.

Wow, this was so easy to make and so good!  Next time I think I will add some peanut butter chips along with the peanut butter/chocolate chips to give it a more peanut butter taste.

This recipe is awesome! Super easy and a big hit. My tweaks - omitted the peanuts & peanut butter, added a handful of butterscotch chips and sprinkled Skor bits on the top. A definite keeper!

I must've have done something differently on this recipe. As far as I can see I followed the directions exactly, and they aren't very difficult. I stirred it constantly for 5 minutes and then removed it from the heat to stir in the marshmellows and chocolate and peanut butter. The marshmellows melted, however it became extremely dry and crumbly. I added some more evaporated milk but it was still very difficult to spread into the pan. I hope it is still okay once it cools.
