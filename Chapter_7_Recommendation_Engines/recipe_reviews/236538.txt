I used a 3 lb. pork sirloin roast (from Costco - love those), and cut the dry rub ingredients in half. Other than that, I followed the recipe. The pork was very moist and flavorful, but the sauce was just a bit too peppery for our tastes. When I make this again, I will cut the rub ingredients back to 1/4, and skip the rub seasonings in the sauce. The bits of the rub that are in the pan are enough to season the sauce along with the asian flavors, in my opinion. Thanks Buon Appetito!

I loved the recipes and I like spacey food but The family thought it was too hot.I cooked it on another occasion and dropped the pepper to 1/2 tbsp.Way better.I would give this version a 4 1/2 star.

The pork was good and juicy.  However the spice mixture had WAY too much pepper in it for me.

This was amazing!!! I loved it and so did my family. Kim is right about cutting the seasoning in a quarter. I highly recommend this recipe but it really takes some time and effort. P.S.  A pork roast works just as well.
