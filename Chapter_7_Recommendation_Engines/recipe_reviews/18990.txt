I make this pudding to see if the texture was grainy and it was as I expected.  Cooking egg whites in a sauce or pudding is a culinary no-no.  The flavor was good but that texture.....I would suggest 6 egg yolk and NO white.  The texture will be velvet.

I really liked this easy recipe, all the ingredients on hand.  The only thing I was disappointed about was the size of the dish I made it in.  Be sure to use only an 8x8 or a 8x10 dish.  I used a 9x13 dish and the pudding was only about 1/2 inch deep.  I was so disappointed.  Next time I will just double the recipe for a 9x13.  Otherwise, very good.

This Recipe is acceptional, but the milk ingredient in it should be partially replace with heavy cream or half-n-half. I stirred the milk to be thicken for almost 10 minutes, and it lacked the fat within to thicken. If the creator made a note about using part heavy cream, then my banana pudding would come out looking 5 times thicker and it would not take 3 hours to just be less thin.

Next time, I will (and to everyone else), use at least 1/4 of the requested milk indgredient amount(ex: reciepe ask for 1 cup of milk, instead...use 3/4 of milk and 1/4 of heavy cream).

I love LOVE this recipe.  Its delicious.  The only thing I do different is use just the egg yolks and I cook on medium heat until pudding thickens.  I've made this for cook outs and its always a hit!  I took the picture of this recipe too.  Sooooo good!

Delicious!!  Just like my Grandmother's!  I use the ingredients exactly as stated.  If your pudding is runny, you need to cook it longer.  If your pudding is really runny when you remove it from the pan, it will also be runny when you serve it.  You will know when you see the change in constitency of your pudding that it's ready to take off the heat.  Enjoy, this is a GREAT recipe!!

This is just like what my mom made many years ago. I followed the recipe and it turned out great. It thickened just like it is supposed to. Stirred in the bananas and then placed nilla wafers on top. Tasted great!

I'm giving this recipe 2 stars not for the taste, but for the vague directions.  I "know" how to make pudding it is basic.  I "know" that you should get the pudding thick enough to coat the back of a spoon and when you run your finger down it you can tell it has thickened up.  What tripped me up in this recipe is the statement "when mixture begins to thicken" indicating at the beginning of the thickening process you take the pudding off the burner.  If you follow the directions and do that you will have runny pudding like so many folks with this recipe including myself had.  I thought it might thicken up when I refrigerated it, but that is not the case.  Cook this pudding until it is thickened than take it off the burner and you should be ok.  The flavor was lovely and I think I would make it again, but next time using my skills and knowledge as a cook and not depending on a recipe that has a slight flaw that will produce a desert that isn't "right"

I am a BIG banana-pudding lover, and I really enjoyed this receipe.  This receipe was so much easier than those double-boiler receipes. My recommedations: (1) use an 8x8 dish (unless you double it to ingredients), and  (2) turn up the heat a little to thicken up the mixture.

Made this for a friend's birthday as it is her favorite dessert.  Turned out great!  I upped the vanilla, used three bananas, only egg whites, and almost a whole box of vanilla wafers, but I followed everything else as written.  Had no problems with runniness, stickiness, etc.  I think the trick may be to stir (constantly) with a whisk so that air gets in to the pudding, preventing lumps and allowing it to cool more evenly.  I would agree that if you plan to get 18 servings out of this, they will be tiny.  I really couldn't see any more than 12.

My first attempt at homemade pudding..it is WONDERFUL!  And easy to boot!  I used a double boiler and whisked the mixture constantly until thickened.  I crushed nilla wafers and sprinkled on top to keep from getting a "film" and it also made a really pretty presentation.

I liked how the easiness of this recipe. And, maybe the egg whites may complicate the smooth texture of this recipe. But, using 3 eggs, is less expensive than using 6 egg yolks. The other change I made to this recipe is that I ran the milk and 2 bananas through the blender and the highest speed. Then I added this mixture to the other ingredients. Not only did it help use up more bananas, which I have plenty of, but it added more banana flavor. I like the genuine banana flavor as opposed to the fake banana flavor derived from the boxed recipes. 
Thanks for sharing this great recipe. It does remind me of my grandparents. They made do with what they had on hand while living as economically as possible.

This is my first time making pudding from scratch. I absolutely could not think of eating pudding out of a box so I tried this recipe for my banana pudding. WOW!!!  I read most of the reviews and made the following changes:  
1.  I doubled the recipe 
2.  I only had 9 eggs so I used 8 yolks and one whole egg
3.  In place of the 4 cups of milk I used 3 cups of whole milk and 1 cup of half and half
4.  Instead of 1 1/3 cups of sugar, I only used one cup and it was plenty sweet
5.  I doubled the vanilla to 2 teaspoons
6.  I stirred the pudding for 12 minutes and it thickened beautifully then I strained it and cooled it so that I could put the banana pudding layers together

That's it -- this is now my go to for pudding w

This recipe is GREAT!! Everybody loved it!! 1 time I made it the exact way except I always dip my  bananas in lemon juice. 2nd time I doubled the recipe. I used whole 3 1/2c milk and 1/2c of half and half, only used egg yolks, and used the whites for the meringue. I always use a little more vanilla and I add a little nutmeg. It was simply the best! Next time I will probably use a little more milk because I only use the yolks.

Great results! Here's what I did: 4 egg yolks. Medium heat. Only took about 12 minutes to thicken. Smooth and creamy and delicious. I also added a smashed banana to the pudding in the end in addition to the sliced banana in the bottom of the pan. Yummy!

This was terrific!  I was in a panic on Thanksgiving when I couldn't find my husband's grandmother's banana pudding recipe - it's a traditional favorite - and went on a frantic search on this site to find somthing similar.  This is it!  I've always used evaporated milk though, so I used it w/this - turned out great!  I would recomend using a litle less vanilla though - it was a tiny bit to strong.  I'd also suggest making this the night before.  Banana pudding ALWAYS tastes beter the next day!

This was FABULOUS!  My kids devoured it and my husband loved it.  I did use about 1/2 cup of half and half in the milk portion and added an extra egg yolk.   Will definitely make again.

I basically followed your recipe (with wonderfully tasty results) but I just put the yolks in, instead of the whole egg.  I remembered a recipe my mom had and she only put the yolks in.  I was disappointed at the amount it made.  Must be small servings...

I followed this one exactly, even extended the heating time but it was still so liquidy, just like water.
My husband stuck it in the freezer so it would freeze, he ate it that way.

The pudding was good.  The texture was smooth.  Be sure to keep stirring until thick.  You will need to double the recipe to fit a 9 x 13 pan.

Wonderful recipe.  I was looking for a recipe like my mom-in-law makes.  This certainly did not disappoint!  I used 2C milk just like the recipe calls for but did use egg yolks instead of entire egg. In addition, as another writer suggested, I cooked my bananas with my sugar/flour mixture.  This gave the pudding a very distinct banana flavor throughout! I will definitely make this again.  It was the hit of the Easter dessert table.

Took raters advice and used 6 egg yolks instead of 3 eggs.  It was an okay pudding.  I wouldn't say fabulous but it was okay.  Easy to prepare.  I used 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of heavy cream so the thickening time was not that much.

I doubled the recipe as recommended for a 9 x 13in pan and I am glad I did.  I made a couple of modifications.  The doubled recipe calls for 4 cups of milk, I wanted to substitue 1cup with heavy cream.  I actually made a mistake at dumped an entire pint of heavy cream in plus the 3 cups of milk.  It turned out so awesome and I got such rave reviews from everyone at the Memorial Day function that I will continue to make that mistake again! I also seperated out the whites from the 6 eggs and used only yokes in the pudding and saved the whites for a meringue topping.  It turned out fabulously creamy, rich, and perfect!  The Meringue topping kept it from getting "skin" on top and I recommend that as well.  I used Meringue II by Saundra from this site.

I had a whole bunch of bananas and a box of boring wheat cookies that no one wanted to eat in the cupboard. I stumbled upon this recipe in my search to use up both ingredients. And I was pleasantly surprised! I made a few small changes as suggested by other users. I doubled the recipe and only used the egg yolks. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly for the pudding part. My pudding thickened beautifully and without any problems. I think it is possible that the users who couldn't get the pudding to thicken may have had the heat set too low. Everyone's oven heats differently, so you have to take that into account. You want the pudding hot enough, but NOT boiling. Mine took about 10-15 minutes to thicken. After I removed it from the heat and let it cool down a little, I added 2 finely chopped bananas to the pudding itself. I crushed up the wheat cookies I had on hand into crumbs and made a sort of graham cracker type crust at the bottom of my glass dish. I added some melted butter, cinnamon, and nutmeg to the crumbs and let the crust toast in the oven for 5 minutes. I let that cool down and then I put the pudding on top. I sliced 2 more bananas for decoration and I also added some more cookie crumbs on top. I let it chill for a few hours before dessert time. My husband couldn't believe that I made this myself, that is how good it was! We ate the whole bowl. When I asked if I should make it again, everyone in the family said YES! So, thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I doubled the recipe and omitted the egg whites. I used 12 egg yolks and whipped them with the sugar and flour. Made it a bit more expensive but man it was worth it! I used bananas that were turning a bit brown in order to get more banana flavor. This was the best banana pudding Ive ever had.

This was exactly the recipe I was looking for.....an old fashioned banana pudding from my childhood. This made a very large banana pudding after I put it together with 3 medium bananas and two layers of vanilla wafers. I mixed the dry ingredients in a microwave-safe mixing bowl, then I whisked the eggs and 2 cups of milk (skim -- all I had on hand) and vanilla. I poured the well whisked egg-milk mixture through a sieve into the dry mixture to filter any little particles that might lump. Once I had whisked the entire pudding until well mixed, I placed it in the microwave oven and cooked on high for 2 minutes. Took it out and whisked well, then put it back for 2 more minutes. I whisked it well again, and because it was thickening, I microwaved 1 minute at a time, whisking well after each minute until it reached the desired consistency. I layered the bottom of the serving bowl with vanilla wafters, spread a thin layer of pudding, then cut 3 bananas over the layer of pudding. I covered the bananas with the remainder of the pudding and then covered the top with vanilla wafers. I used HOMEMADE vanilla wafers from a little local bakery near us...Slatonbakery.com.  Delicious and so easy! (Warning: The pudding will thicken around the edges first, but if you whisk well each time, it will be smooth and will not have lumps.)

I did everything as directed and the pudding did not thicken up until I added corn starch.   So I am not sure if an ingredient was missed in error or if I possibly did do something wrong I was not aware of.  The idea was good but did not execute as I expected.

Great recipe.  I also put it in the oven for around 15-20 minutes or until golden brown on top.  Then refrigerate because the baking will soften the cookies and brown the bananas some.  Thanks!

I loved it...It was the first time I made it.  It had great flavor, mine didn't set too well, I prolly didn't cook it long enough, wasn't really sure how long.  I also agree with another reviewer that a smaller dish may make this a little deeper, was quite shallow, but the flavor was spot on...and I didn't notice any 'grainy' as another reviewer said...IDK!

Wow!  Really good homemade banana pudding! I picked this recipe because it was very close to my french pastry cream recipe, which is out of this world, and it tasted very similar except not as thick. Only change I did was to double the recipe so i would have a deep 9x13" dish and good thing I did.  I probably added 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons vanilla.  I added until it was to my liking and after doubling everything else, I left the butter at 2 tablespoons (only to save on fat a little).  Also, the author didn't mention if you bring it to the boil, but I figured since it's eggs, you have to.  And that was when it got really thick anyway. I was a bit hesitant to put hot filling over the bananas, I thought they might turn black.  So I whisked in 2 ice cubes to cool it a little more and poured it over the bananas and cookies very warm, not hot.  But to my relief, the bananas did not turn one bit brown.  I topped my dish with whipped cream.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I should've read the reviews prior to making this. This was my 1st time in over 10 yrs making one from scratch. The 1st attempt I doubled and did not let thicken enough so I believed that the custard would thicken overnight. Woke up to find mush in a bowl. The 2nd venture turned out much better. But, heed my advice let the custard thicken (as previously suggested) about 15 mins. Good taste overall.

DIVINE!!! I followed the tips from the recipe rating directly beneath mine.  Except I added one more banana, and ran 5 sheets of grahams through the food processor to make a fine topping for the top so no skin would form.  My mom and I were eating it for breakfast just now!! It's to-die-for warm, and to-die-for chilled! Definately one of my favorite dessert recipes ever!!!

This recipe is awesome!!! The only thing is that the pudding takes sooooo long to thicken. I cranked up the heat and it still turned out fine. Also I took 3 egg whites and beat until fluffy while gradually added 1/4 cup of sugar to create a meringue to go on top. I then put it in the oven for 15 minutes to brown the top and it was scrumptious. Update: I have been making this pudding for almost 10 years and I believe I have now "perfected the recipe! So as to not burn the pudding, you can substitute a 1/4 of the milk content for heavy whipping cream and it will thicken up and smooth out great. i.e. instead of 2 cups of milk add 1 1/2 cups of milk and a 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream. I also do not put any egg whites in the pudding. I love meringue on my banana pudding and I take all the eggs the recipe calls for and only add yolks while using the whites to make delicious meringue with the recipe I included earlier. To DIE for!

My first attempt at making a banana pudding turned out fantastic!  I read the comments others had posted and used some of them.  I used 7 egg yolks in the pudding instead of 3 whole eggs.   I stored the egg whites to make meringue later after the pudding had cooled.  I also used 5 small bananas and a square dish, about 8X8 which was perfect.  I cut back on milk by a 1/4 cup.  I didn't think the pudding would ever get ready but when it did, I knew it was ready.

The flavor is wonderful, but it has been in the refrigerator for 2 hours and still has not set up.  Right now it's like a thin banana milkshake.  Very disappointed.  We were all looking forward to having the pudding tonight.

I made this as per the recipe (no changes) and it was very good (although a little sweeter, I think I'd use less sugar next time). Not grainy even though I used whole eggs.  I used whole milk and the cooking time to thicken was only about 25 minutes. Will make again.

My first attempt at a banana pudding and it turned out great. It helped reading the other reviews because it does take 10-15 minutes to thicken (I would of given up if I didn't read that). I used a smaller dish per the other reviews too. However, it came out delicious - no need to add or delete ingredients.

I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for instant pudding, and this is a good one. Not quite sure why a 9x13 dish was called for...I was able to fit it quite nicely into a refrigerator dish with room to spare. Also, it's much better if allowed to sit in the refrigerator over night. Will definitely make again, but will reduce the number of cookies, and increase the number of bananas.

Scrumptious.  I only wish the cooking time had been specified; after 1 hour on low/medium heat I was just about to call it quits, but turned up the heat to high and within 5 minutes, the pudding had set.  Not being an expert cook, I don't know if 60 minutes is typical for pudding, but I'd be tempted to put the heat a little higher next time.  (I see other reviewers say low heat is key.  Maybe I stirred too constantly to let it heat up??)  It sure tasted great and I'd definitely double it if serving more than 4.

This is the best Banana Pudding Recipe, no leftovers in my house!  I'm not sure why some had problems with this recipe, maybe they tried to rush it, you can tell by the end of cooking, if it will set or not. Low temperature is the key. This pudding is just like my Grandma's, delicious! I will NEVER make it with instant pudding again.  WOW YUMMY!

I made this pudding for my very picky boyfriend and he loved it.  I am lactose intolerant (but I can handle butter) so I made it with plain soy milk instead of the cow stuff, and it came out great.  Mr. Picky eater didn't even know that I used soy.  I put the heat at medium, and didn't have any trouble getting the pudding to thicken.

Great tasting recipe.   I will triple it next time as I used a 9x13 pan this time and it was such a thin layer of pudding.  There is no way that this recipe serves 18 people.  My family of 5 had it gone in one sitting.

I prepared this yesterday and just ate a big bowl of it for Easter brunch.  It was delicious!  As suggested I doubled the recipe for 9X13 dish and cooked it on medium heat which thickened it up just fine.  I topped it with whipped cream and crushed vanilla wafers.  This banana pudding has that wonderful homemade flavor that you cannot possibly get from a boxed pudding mix.

I used the suggestion of 6 yolks in place of 3 eggs and used corn starch instead of flour and this recipe is absolutely fantastic.

I added a little extra vanilla, and cooked it between the 3 and 4 setting on my stove...it took about 15 minutes to cook, but I could fix the rest of dinner at the same time so it worked out perfect.

My Mom always made homemade banana pudding, so I really dislike the ones made from instant pudding. I think this one is even better than Mom's though. Great recipe!

I doubled the pudding and used an 8X8 baking dish.  I stacked the cookies around the dish and made some fresh whipped cream to go on top.  My family enjoyed this desert.

My husband is from the South, and considers himself an expert on Banana Pudding. This one passed the critical taste test.  I made it twice in one week, and had to double the recipe the second time so that there would be enough to satisfy him for a while!  Definitely a keeper!

This was so good. Ate a bowl before it got put in the refrigerator. Much better than instant pudding mixes. Didn't take too long to thicken. May as well make a double batch cause it doesn't make much.

This recipe I'd very close to the one my family has used for years! I would only change from 3 eggs to 3 egg yolks (save the white for a whipped topping.) and use condensed sweet milk with the whole milk to make it creamy.  Otherwise this is a great recipe. I always have to double or triple it for family get togethers.

I was looking for a banana pudding recipe made from scratch and I came across this one. I read some of the reviews ahead of time and saw quite a few people had problems with it being too runny. I made sure that I stirred it constantly while it was cooking on the until it was very thick before I removed it from the heat. I crushed the vanilla wafers and layered some on the bottom of the dish followed by a layer of sliced bananas.  I sprinkled the top with more crushed vanilla wafers.  I ended up using four bananas instead of two.  It came out fantastic.  My son said it was the best banana pudding he had ever had!

I used the 6 egg yolks as suggested in other reviews and used a higher heat setting as suggested but my pudding was still runny. Maybe I didn't cook it long enough. The taste was great though, just runny and never set up.

This is a good recipe for a homemade banana pudding.  I did what others suggested and cooked the mix over med-low heat to make it thicken up quicker. It still took a little longer than I had expected, but nothing too bad. about 20-30 minutes.  I also used just egg yolks like others suggested and it came out really creamy, just the way I like it! I also doubled the recipe to fit in a 9x13 inch glass pan, because let's face it, anhything smaller just isn't enough! =) It was a little sweet for my liking, but my husband loved it, and he's just about the world's biggest banana pudding Lover. We'll definately be making this one again!

This was quite simple to prepare with great results.  I did follow the suggestions to omit the whites and double the yolks.  There were a few tiny lumps, which could be resolved by cooking the custard in a double boiler instead of directly on the heat.  So as not to form a skin, I topped the pudding with a meringue I made from half the reserved egg whites (3) and 1/4 C. sugar.  Whipped it on high, topped the pudding with it, and baked it at 425 for 5 min. YUM!

This is one I'll have to try again in hopes that it will come out as expected.  I stirred it constantly over low heat for an hour, and it never thickened.  When I turned up the heat, it started to form chunks.  I checked my ingredient list over and over, thinking I must have put in too much milk, but I didn't.  I went through with it anyway, hoping it would thicken in the fridge, but it never did.  The flavors were so great, we ate it anyway, calling it "Banana Soup".  Definitely one to try, but a word of warning...the stirring takes forever, and don't take it off the stove until it's thick enough for your liking, since it won't thicken afterwards.

From other reviews I put this in a 2 quart cassarole dish. I also used 4 bananas made a layer of wafers then bananas and 1/3 of pudding. I did this for a total of 3 layers then put wafers around the edge standing up. I crumbled 3 wafers and sprinkled on top. I will make this again. Thank you for the recipe.

I've made this several times, as directed.  (Except I add wafers individually as served so they don't get soggy.)  It is wonderful.   I will never make instant pudding again.  The whole egg is fine, just be patient and stir stir stir.  It will seem like it will never thicken up then...bam....thickened.

My husbands favorite dessert is banana pudding. His mothers was always his favorite. Well now mine is his favorite. I use this recipe and he says it’s the best he has ever had, along with three of my family members. It’s not grainy at all and it is amazing. I always add some extra nilla wafers but only because they are my husbands fav part. Love this recipe and I’ve recommended it to many!

Excellent!  I made a change in the eggs and the technique..I did use only yolks and held them back until the pudding came to a boil.  I tempered the yolks with some of the pudding and added it back to the pan and cooked it about 2 minutes more until it came to a boil, then boiled it for a minute longer.   I whisked in the butter and vanilla last.   It was perfectly thickened.   This is really a lot like a pastry cream.  I used lactose free whole milk in this recipe.  Thanks, Sara!

I've made pissing from scratch once before, but it was a corn starch recipe.

This recipe is vague. I removed the pudding from the range when it started to thicken. Apparently this is wrong and you have to actually let it thicken all the way on the range. 

It also wasn't clear about how much it needed to cool before adding the butter or layering it with the bananas and wafers.

The texture is very grainy.

To fix it, I had to add cornstarch and put it back on the range until it thickened all the way. 

I won't be using this recipe again and don't recommend it to anyone.

Mine turned out excellent! Texture was creamy and not too stiff. It was really easy and tasted just like the good old fashioned, nothing sophisticated

I made the recipe as written and like another reviewer here found it to be grainy.  Also I thought it to be too sweet for my tastes, but I am very sensitive to the taste of granulated sugar.  In the future I will make this recipe with egg yolks only and less sugar for sure and probably will substitute heavy cream for some of the milk.

I took the advice of some of the other posters. I swapped out 1/2 of the milk for heavy cream, and replaced the 3 whole eggs with 6 egg yolks. The pudding was awesome. At first I had a hard time getting it to thicken, but when I raised the temperature slightly (from 3 to 4 on my electric cooktop) it thickened nicely. Great recipe, thanks!

My husband is the banana pudding lover, and it wasn't sweet enough for him, and I didn't like the color of the pudding after it set.  It just didn't have "the umph" that he was expecting.  followed recipe right to the letter.

This was a excellent recipe. Instead of using the store bought vanilla wafers, i used this recipe and made my own. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/vanilla-wafer-cookies-that-are-better-than-storebought/detail.aspx

I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the recipe.  I altered a few things: I like lots of bananas, so I added another banana or two. And I was almost out of milk, so I used a little bit of half-and-half. But the whole thing turned out perfectly--some people mentioned a grainy texture, but I didn't notice anything like that. Pretty sure the trick is to keep stirring constantly. And I wasn't serving until the next day, so I held off on putting the vanilla wafers on until the last second (to cut down on sogginess).

Easy and lovely! I made this right up, doubling the recipie for our larger family. It is not grainy, I just followed the recipie and it worked out fine. Homemade pudding puts the flavor of the boxed pudding mixes to shame, and is not that much more difficult to prepare. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very easy pudding recipe. I love how versatile it is, don't like bananas? Make it a vanilla pudding! The only thing is the written recipe may be difficult for new pudding cooks, i.e. how to add ingredients and when to stop cooking is vague.

This is the first time I have ever made Banana Pudding and I am THRILLED that I chose to use this recipe. I read through all the comments first, and opted to use only egg yolks instead whole eggs (as per several suggestions), and I opted to turn the heat up a little more while constantly stirring to ensure there was no lumping. The pudding was excellent when I first served it a few hours after making it, but I was unprepared for how AWESOME it was the next day!! I could not believe that I had made something so delicious the first time! This is perfect on its own without the wafers and to use as a banana cream filling. THANK YOU for sharing this recipe; it was a huge success for me! :)

This was fantastic! I was looking for a banana pudding for Thanksgiving that tasted like Mom's. I doubled the recipe, as suggested by other reviewers. I still used an 8 x 8 pan and added two more bananas. Everyone love it! I will definately make this one again!

Really great flavor!  After reading other reviews, I doubled the recipe, and it was perfect in my 9x12 baking pan. Also used egg yolks in place of whole eggs.  I'll make it again very soon, but I'm going to find someone else to stir the custard as it heats! My arm got tired.

I usually try a recipe for the first time without changing anything.  I did the same for this one and was extremely pleased! I have my own recipe for banana pudding which is in my head that my daughter says is the best ever. Although the taste is the sameI do believe the pudding in this one is creamier so will use this one from now on. Thanks for sharing!!

I was skeptical at first about a pudding that didn"t get cooked. I grew up with an old fashioned mother who made "the"worlds best Banana pudding. So I changed it a little to suit my liking.And I think if you try the changes you will agree it's  better. I dont like egg whites in any_ thing culinarly sweet.So I substituted 6 egg yolks for the 3 whole egg's, and  instead of 2 cups of whole milk I used 1& 1/2 cups of milk and 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream. Outside of the changes I made this is an "exceptional" recipie. It' also great with cool whip topped.

Good recipe but I substituted splenda for sugar plus used 1/3 cup flour + 2 tblsp, and only 2 egg yolks beaten,and 1 tblsp butter..the rest the same. It takes about 15 min to thicken..using just yolks instead of a whole egg makes it come out really smooth..

Wonderful and super easy! I was just looking for a basic vanilla pudding recipe and this will be the one I go to. I used 2% milk and the pudding turned out nice and thick. Great texture, even with the egg whites included. I made it a 2nd time last night and melted in 6 oz of semi sweet chocolate with the butter and vanilla - wonderful! The only reason I'm not giving the recipe 5 stars is because it does make a rather small batch. I doubled the recipe to feed 9 people. There was about 3 servings left over.

Cut this down to "6" servings, but still used 2 yolks instead of one egg.  Used crushed animal crackers and layered with 2 bananas before pouring on the custard.  After cooling, topped it off with fresh whipped cream.  Yummmmm

I thought the taste was great!  I agree the directions on cooking the pudding are vague.  The pudding thickened for me.  I recommend cooking it longer than you may think you need to.  I also recommend a smaller pan or doubling the recipe.  One serving is not enough to fill such a large pan.  I will make this again.

I just tasted this creation I made yesterday.  I followed the reicpe with a couple of changes.  I used 5 egg yolks, six bananas and more waffers.  Next time I will double everything else.  Other than that, this was goooood.  My hubby loved it.

Not sure why some of the other reviewers had trouble with this recipe. Just cook slow over medium heat and it will thicken. This is the good old fashioned way to make banana pudding - much better than the instant pudding recipes.

Pudding never thickened despite following the recipe to the letter.  I give it two stars only because the runny mess tasted good.

this banana pudding was delicious!! my family inhaled it :) the only change i made was to omit the butter (not really a butter fan), and it still turned out perfectly. thanks so much for sharing this recipe, it is definately a keeper.

I used this recipe as more of a base for a banana pie since I did not have any vanilla wafer cookies. I made a graham crust and layered 3 sliced bananas on top. As suggested by previous people, instead of using 3 eggs, I used 6 egg yolks and cooked the mixture till it really thickened (about 15 minutes). I then ran it through a strainer since there seemed to be some small lumps. I let it cool then added it to my pie and then added a layer of whipped cream so that I wouldn't get a skin on my pudding.
It was absolutely fantastic.

This came out great. I agree with what someone else said about using only the yolks. I never use the whites in puddings or custards so I left them out with this one too. One other note is to make sure to cool the pudding some before adding or layering with the bananas. If you don't the outside of the banana pieces gets cooked and tough. I also put it in a large bowl instead of in a 9x13 pan.

This is delicious.  I used the vanilla wafer recipe from this site instead of the boxed cookies.  I poured the pudding into four wine glasses and stuck the vanilla wafters into the pudding instead of using the baking dish.  This was the kids got their own "fancy" pudding and they were thrilled.  Very yummy.  Thanks for sharing.

Fantastic vanilla flavor!!  Cooked on medium-low heat until it was just a smidge thinner than "pudding".  After refrigerating, it turned out to have the perfect consistency.  I used a 9-inch pie plate and it worked nicely, but I could have still doubled the recipe.  If using a 9x13, I recommend TRIPLING the recipe!  No way this serves 18.  Maybe 6 or 8.  **Note:  It helps to have a gas stove to control the heat.  Definitely needs to be cooked above a low setting to turn out less watery.

This banana pudding is really very good and so simple to make.  I've always used boxed pudding so it was a real treat to find a homemade pudding recipe that used ingredients I always have on hand.  I did not have any of the problems some other reviewers experienced...the pudding thickend with no problem and firmed up nicely in the fridge.  And, I found that the texture of the pudding was velvety despite egg whites being a "culinary no-no" in sauces and pudding.  I made a couple of changes.  First I used three whole bananas and cooked the pudding over medium heat until it began to thickend and then turned the heat to low until it came to the desired consistency.

Very good and tasty recipe. We doubled the recipe as other reviewers suggested. Everyone loved it. It takes a long, long time to thicken. Definately not for young children as they would get totally bored stirring and stirring. Less sweet a little less vanilla flavor than I prefer, yet a very good recipe.

This recipe was great!  My whole family loved it.  Since there didn't seem to be enough pudding mixture I used an 8x8 baking dish.  And also ended up using 4 bananas to complete two layers (maybe my nanas were small) It was a winner, and we will use it again and again.  Thanks

Flavor was good but other than adding egg yolks instead of whole eggs as suggested I followed recipe. It looked great but after refrigerating for a bit it was runny when I went to serve it.

I'm rating 1 star because I followed the directions exactly and it didn't thicken up even after 1 hour of stirring on low heat. Very poor directions.

I love this recipe. It's easy and fast and the best part its homemade! The trick with the eggs is to heat gradually and use a whisk continually so the pudding doesn't turn grainy or clumpy. I will be making this again.

i was very confused on this recipe. the pudding tasted nothing like banana. i wouldn’t even call it banana pudding. i thought you would put the bananas into the pudding but only on top? if you don’t put bananas on the pudding it tastes really gross. wouldn’t recommend unless you like bland “banana” pudding.

The pudding was tasty with 3 whole eggs and was thick in less than 10 minutes. I substituted corn starch for flour and reduced sugar to 1/2 cup. I had lots of soft lady finger cookies and used them instead of vanilla wafers and everything fit nicely in an 8x8 pan. After it chilled I covered with a thin layer of lightly sweetened whipped cream. My guests loved it.

I always use this recipe, except I also mash up 2 bananas with a half cup of sweetened condensed milk and stir that into the pudding mixture. It sweetens it up a little bit more and thickens it.

Wish I read the full reviews. Cooked for over 40 minutes never thickened. Added more flour and still didn't.  Refrigerated but after reading 1-star reviews don't have much hope that it will ever thicken.  Will not make it again.

I modified the recipe by using just the egg yolks. It gave it a velvety texture!  This recipe is easy and flavorful. I highly recommend trying it yourself.

I prefer my desserts less sweet than a lot of folks, so I used a bit less sugar.  I should have used probably only 75% of what was called for.  But I liked it otherwise.  I tasted it before & after adding the butter; I think it would be fine without it.

Delicious!!! I did tweet it though: used six egg yolks (no whites), used 1.5 heavy whip & .5 half n half (2 cups total). I beat eggs then I slowly added milk to eggs and beat well. I then added that mixture to the dry mixture slowly in med. heat while storing until thick. I did NOT use any butter! I mashed (with a fork) 6 bananas and added them to the mixture. It’s AMAZING!!!!!! We will eat w wafers! I won’t put in, bc they will get mushy!

I've never made pudding with flour in it before! At first I thought it was too thick but after day 3, it had not separated (like most pudding I've made both by scratch and a mix). I wasn't fond of it until day 2 and 3. Everyone else liked it though! 

I will make it again, but I will decrease the flour by a third to see if I can find a happy medium with the thickness. When I made it this time I cut the sugar in half (which I found to be perfect for me, especially with the bananas). 

Overall I like the recipe!

Vanilla wafers are boring.  Followed recipe.  Used HWC instead of milk.   BEAT EGGS WELL.   Used a bishkoff wafer instead of vanilla wafers.  Put thin layer of pudding over cookies.  Then two layers of sliced banana and rest of pudding.  Topped with left over filling from a cookie thinned with whip cream.  Spread on top covered with bishkoff crumbs.

Add one very over-ripe banana. I keep them in the freezer awaiting the next batch of banana bread. I defrosted one for about a minute or so and it was nearly liquid. Added 3 tablespoons more flour to compensate for added fluid. Skipped the nilla wafers...just sliced in two more fresh bananas after thickening.

The pudding was very runny. I would leave it on the heat a little longer than just beginning to thicken.

I made it and it came out perfect! The key is to stir to thickness and that can take 16-20 minutes. I don't really like Bananas in my pudding. I used less than half of one and very thinly cut. I also used evaporated milk instead of regular milk. The consistency was perfect. I really wanted to make a larger serving but didn't want to risk it by doubling the ingredients. I cooked on the stove top on 4 for 19 minutes. Came out great. Thanks!

The flavor is great.  But it never thickens.  I cooked it for probably 20-30 minutes, and it never thickened.  I ended up having to make a packaged vanilla pudding and mix it at the last minute as we used this recipe for dinner with friends.  I wish I had read the reviews first.  It was rated so high that I didn't think I needed to.  Again, great flavor, but the recipe itself doesn't work.

This recipe was amazing! I changed the servings to 8, and followed the directions. The only change I made was at the advice of other reviewers. For 8 servings I used 1 cup of sugar only, 3 cups of milk and 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and 6 egg yolks without the egg whites. I started my heat at a low 4 on an electric stove, and after 5 minutes of constant whisking I turned my heat up to a 6. By the 12 minute mark of constant stirring, my pudding thickened up immediately. I added the butter and vanilla and stirred for another 7 minutes. The result was a very rich and nice banana pudding. Very good.

No changes. The recipe my grandmother used, was once pudding thickens you add a little pudding to eggs and mix and add into the rest. Seemed a little loose, but we will see. Just put in fridge to cool down.  Pudding had good taste. More to follow.

This turned out really tasty. Just the right amount of sweetness. I used three bananas and cooked the pudding on low heat first and after all the ingredients were all blended in, I upped the heat to medium, stirring constantly. It thicken up in about 7 minutes.

I made this for my husband on Father's Day because it is one of his favorite desserts but I don't like all the mystery stuff that is put into boxed instant pudding.  This tasted good enough but in my opinion, the pudding tasted very strongly of eggs.  More like custard or flan, which I personally don't like very much but everyone else seemed to like it well enough.

Also, it was my first time making homemade pudding and to be fair, I was using King Arthur's gluten free flour blend which I have had good luck with acting just like "regular" flour .  However, there were not really any clear directions as to how thick the pudding should be once it started thickening and the video didn't really describe that either.  I wasn't sure how much  it would firm up after it had cooled and I gambled wrong so it was more like milkshake consistency. Not sure what I should/could have done to thicken it more.
 
I followed the reviews suggestions and used mostly egg yolks  rather than full eggs to make it good and creamy.   And doubled the recipe as I was feeding 8 of us.   I put it together using gluten free vanilla wafers in a truffle bowel  (I forgot to take a picture), put some whipped cream (whipped with some vanilla and powdered sugar) on top and it was decently filled. It fed 8 of us a fairly large serving with some left over.  

Like I said it was good enough and my husband enjoyed it, which for that day was what mattered. And while I'll keep it in my collection, I'm not really sure if

AMAZING!!! The only thing it needed was more vanilla, I tasted it with 1/4 tsp and it needed a full tsp. Otherwise phenomenal! The texture was perfect. Make sure to layer with the banana while the pudding is still very warm so it absorbs the flavor. I doubled the recipe and it was perfect for a 9x13. Will be making regularly, great recipe!

Not bad, I also have never used the entire egg for puddings or pie filling. Therefore, I only used the egg whites. I added more vanilla to pack in more flavor. S/N though my vanilla wasn't a very potent one.

Searching for banana pudding recipes on Google and found this one.  Nope it's vanilla pudding with banana slices and wafer cookies. That's info that should be in the title. If you search it on this site you see it's vanilla pudding.

I made this a couple of times now. I used half a cup of heavy cream to 1.5 cups of whole milk. I also cut the sugar to just 1/3 cup after I found it way too sweet with the 2/3 cup. My coworkers also found the bananas really shined through with less sugar. I had no issues with the eggs clumping. Once the mixture hit the sauce pan I did not stop stirring until my desired consistency was reached. Really good recipe will make over and over again for sure!!!

I doubled this recipe as suggested from some of the reviews.  I loved it and it came out great.  It was smooth, not grainy and I had no problem with it thickening.  It is my new favorite banana pudding recipe.

This was a near fail for me;I’ll def take others’ suggestions next time to use yolks only and probably at least part cream.  The milk alone was too runny; had to stir forever and even added a little cornstarch to thicken it up which I think affected the flavor.

I followed this using whole milk and it was awesome! Do make sure you cook it long enough to make it thick. It doesn’t thicken up very much like some other things will, so watch that. Delicious though. I’ll make it again. I also topped with homemade whipped cream and it was even better that way!

This was FANTASTIC!! A hit at the party! I doubled the recipe and used 12 egg yolks instead of 6 whole eggs.  I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and added 1/4 tsp of banana extract into the custard which really added great flavor. Depending on your stovetop, you may need to play with the heat to find the best temperature.  This did take some to time to come together and I ended up increasing the heat to almost medium, stirring constantly.  Be patient - It will thicken beautifully! Topped it with homemade whipped cream and this was the most popular dessert at the housewarming party! Even better the next day!! Definitely a keeper!!

I doubled the serving size and sliced up 10 small organic bananas. I liquefied them in an blender with half of the milk the recipe called for. I added the banana milk mixture in to the saucepan with the rest of the milk and then mostly followed the recipe as written. (I also turned the heat to medium-high and constantly stirred with an whisk for over half an hour until the pudding was thick enough to me liking.) It doth not thicken up much more from the finished product in the refrigerator, so make sure that ye constantly stir and cook it until it be the consistency ye want ye pudding to be whence ye serve it. Most people put vanilla wafers upon the top. I simply used more fresh banana slices. For an creamier pudding, use half and half or liquid coffee creamer instead of milk. I also doubled the vanilla. (I made it this way since I had 25 lbs of bananas to use up) Me version makes enough pudding to fill an 9x13 baking pan.

This was very good! I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and did 5 egg yolks instead of whole eggs. I didn't have a problem with it getting thick. I did cook it on medium though. These changes are why I gave it 4 stars. I also thought it was plenty of pudding. Put it in a 9-in pie dish.

After reading everyone's review about it being grainy I was so nervous and when I was done to my surprise no grainy texture! If you mix your dry ingredients together add eggs mix well then add milk you will NOT have a grainy texture! I didn't really change anything but I did add more vanilla flavor not extract and mashed bananas and it was so delicious. To give you an idea of how much it makes I was able to fill 2 16 oz mason jars, one 7oz and one 4oz

To anyone who says this pudding or anything else that they make turns out Lumpy, use a metal wisk to stir it with instead of a spatula. Wisk  the eggs with the milk together, and Then add them to the dry ingredients!
This recipe will not thicken on Low temp on an electric range, maybe it is written for a gas range. I cook mine on Medium temp and to bring it up to Medium temp quickly by putting it on a higher temp. but feel the outside of your pan and don't walk away when using this technique to save time. Even with getting it up to temp fast, plan to stir for about 10 minutes! 
I used pastured milk and had some Organic Banana Extract that I found online. I added a small dash of Nutmeg because I had some homeade banana pudding at a local BBQ place that had some in it and was great! I also made it with peanut butter cookies crunched up, I had it this way at another local BBQ place and it is great too! I'm not someone who has ever eaten a banana and PB sandwich Or, ever would but, this is a yummy twist on Banana pudding!
Adding a ripe banana to the pudding while cooking to boost the banana flavor if you don't have an Organic extract sounded Amazing to me and I may try that Instead sometime, even though 1tbsp of the Organic extract tastes and smells Amazing!!!

I gave it a 3 for ease and taste, but the directions are a little vague. How long do you let it thicken for? What should the consistency be, before you remove it from the heat? How long should it cool before adding the butter and vanilla? Needless to say, my pudding didn't turn out as thick as I would have liked it. Next time I think I will omit the egg whites and cook it much longer.

Made as directed , until I realized that I didn't have vanilla wafers.
So I ground up some pecan pinwheels that I had on hand.
It was very nice
I will probably often substitute the pinwheels for the wafers  now

I love pudding so I was so excited to try this, but ended up disappointed. First, after 30 minutes of constant stirring on low heat, the mixture had not thickened at all. I then turned the heat up to medium and it thickened up after about 12 more minutes. It set up fine in the refrigerator and it had a good taste, but the texture was so grainy we couldn't eat it. Had to throw it away.

It tastes like cake batter! I used skim milk and was able to get it thick enough; just takes a while (about 20 minutes of stirring) I did turn the heat up to medium towards the end, and I also used 3 egg yolks and 3 regular eggs (it was doubled). Made a cake pan full.

This is absolutely amazing! It took me a little longer to make though, probably because the heat was too low. I let my husband lick the spoon after I was done and now he's having a hard time waiting for it to cool for an hour. I'll definitely be making this again!

I tried this recipe based on the reviews.  I did use egg yolks not the whites.
The consistency was great.  The taste left a lot to be desired.
I will not be making this again.

Hello.  this is my very first review.  I felt I had to because it simply is not a good recipe.  The taste is there but the pudding itself is runny.  The cookies should have been crushed which is what I almost did but thought I should just try it as is. But note the picture,  the cookies are crumbled. Yet , nothing is mentioned in the recipe.  Best not to bother with this one. . I usually look at reviews but didn't this time until it was too late  . lesson learned. ?

Hubby loved this!  Perfect amount of sweetness.   Doubled the recipe and used almost 6 small bananas.  Also, we doubled the amount of vanilla extract.     Also, The custard base is great alone or with any fruit!

I used this recipe because it was very similar to the one I have used since my great-grandmother showed me how years ago. I only used the egg yolks and I used a double boiler since I am used to doing it that way.  I tripled the recipe for Thanksgiving and no one knew it wasn't the same recipe I normally use. Rave reviews from family.  I beat egg yolks and added the warm milk mixture to them and beat them well and then added to the pan with rest of milk mixture.  No lumps at all.

This pudding was not grainy at all. It had a wonderfully smooth and delicate texture. I did stir constantly over medium heat with a whisk, however. The next time I make this I will double the vanilla and make a double batch.

I loved this recipe!  I did take others suggestions and replaced 1/4c milk with heavy cream and I used 4 egg yolks instead of  3 whole eggs.  This recipe is going in my saved recipes!

Great recipe to make real, homemade pudding fairly easily. Entire egg affected texture, which the family commented about but still are the entire thing. Also used a bit of heavy cream to add richness and thickness. Making this for guests this weekend and will just use egg yolks (increasing the amount), add in some heavy cream (maybe stir in some sour cream at end for complexity), and cut back on sugar. Will also double the recipe for a large dish. Easy, great, real banana pudding!

I made this and literally cooked it for 30 min even raised the temp after the initial 15min to medium and it never thickened! Put it in the fridge for an hr and still it was like water.

This was the first time for me to make banana pudding and this recipe is so easy and delicious!  I did make it in a smaller dish and put three egg yolks instead of three whole eggs.  Also, I put cool whip on top of the bananas and vanilla wafers.  Yummy!

Used the egg whites to make a whipped topping all you have to do is use a blender when it gets fluffy add sugar pour on pudding bake until golden brown.

I made this last night and followed the recipe except I replaced 1/4 cup of the milk with heavy cream and I also cooked it a good bit longer than when it first starts to thicken. I think you have to use your own judgement on that, but I would cook it until it's as thick as you want it to be when completed. I don't know if it needed the heavy cream to thicken up, I just added it because I like the richness it adds. It was super creamy and so much better than store bought puddings. This recipe is making it into my recipe box with only the slightest of adjustments.

Super delicious! Reminds me of my childhood. My sister and brother-in-law loved it as well, so I am doubling the recipe tomorrow and taking them half. Thanks so much for this fantastic pudding recipe! :) YUMMY!  Oh, and by the way, it is MUCH better the second and third day!

Wonderful. I enjoyed this recipe very much.  It was like my grandmother used to make.  When I let my sauce cool I added a small can of pineapples and added a whip cream topping, sprinkled with wafers and pineapples and my family loved it.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This pudding was delicious!  Way better than an instant pudding box.  The first time I made it I added an extra egg, but just the yoke. The second time I made this I added about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, or maybe a little bit more,  and is was AMAZING!! It made the pudding more rich. Everyone said it was awesome! I also used 4 eggs and just the yokes like others have mentioned, and sprinkled the top with some cinnamon.

Very good, but of course instead of cooking the pudding all together, I tempered and added the eggs after the rest had thickened, whisking well.  For a change, and because I didn't have vanilla wafers & didn't feel like making any, I layered bananas, pudding, frozen blueberries, pudding, bananas, pudding, and topped with frozen blueberries.  I also added the zest and juice of one orange along with the vanilla.  It came out really good!

Contrary to some reviews, my pudding came out silky smooth, stir and stir and stir some more, be patient. Use the best ingredients, why skimp when your making it from scratch. I used unsalted  butter and Madagascar Vanilla and it was perfect! Cooled it  and I did use one shortcut because I forgot heavy whipping cream for  whip cream, we used cool whip.  Another thing if you want a custard like pudding which is different in taste and texture omit the egg whites and use egg yokes and cook this over a double broiler. But was a great recipe!

I followed this recipe exactly as it is and it turned out delicious! Next time, I will use WHOLE milk instead of 2%. The 2% worked, but took longer to thicken. This recipe is definitely going in my "favorites" book!

I made this recipe for the first time for Christmas. My husband raved about it and has asked for it many times since. I did change to a smaller version and used 2 bananas so when I make the original version I will increase the amount of bananas since my family likes a lot of bananas. Yum Yum

Never set up.  Very disappointing and expensive since it had to be tossed.  I read one of the other negative reviews and that reviewer mentioned something that may have been the problem.  The directions say that when the pudding 'begins' to thicken, take it off the heat.  Maybe it should have cooked longer.  No matter, I won't risk the time and expense again.

It is a great recipe, but the portions sure seem small to me. I made the recipe for 12 and it only fills a 1 quart bowl about 2/3 full. So, just make the full amount and you'll have plenty...it tastes great!

Double the recipe for a 13 x 9 pan.  You will want this recipe doubled.  I made my version with only egg yolks and it was fantastic.  This dessert will go fast.

-1 star because I wouldn't advise putting in egg whites. I used 4 egg yolks and followed the rest of the recipe. Absolutely delicious with home made whip cream!! Thanks!

I followed this recipe exactly as written and it was delicious. I had no problems with texture as did some other reviewers. It was very smooth and creamy. I did not use egg whites only or use part cream as did other reviewers. The only thing I would do differently would be to double the pudding part of the recipe. There is not enough pudding for a 9X13 pan. The original recipe states that it will serve 18. We used the whole thing for four adults and three children.

this was alright it tasted more like a custard than a pudding the kids enjoyed it. they knew something was different. i told them that it was homemade and not the box one. i had a few problems with the cornstarch. it thickened well but after i refrigerated it for a while it thinned out a bit. probably because of my cornstarch issues. i'll probably search for a recipe that uses flour instead.

I started making from scratch banana pudding many years ago for my restaurant and this has been a faithful base recipe for me. I only add egg yolks as I use the whites for my chicken dip. I also add some cornstarch. The butter REALLY makes the difference. I didn't give it 5 stars only because of the changes I made in the recipe. You really have to just stand and stir it the whole time it's cooking!

Substituted 4 egg yolks, turned out very good.  Cooked on medium heat to thick and took about 15 minutes to cook.

This was very good pudding, egg whites and all!  Highly recommend to anyone.  We may double the recipe next time, though.

this banana pudding is the best i have ever had!!  i had a problem with it being really runny when i made it at first, so i tried to fix it by putting it back on the stove and cooking it at medium heat instead of low, and then it thickened up nicely.

Absolutely delicious! I made a small alteration to this recipe after reading some of the other reviews, and only used 1 cup of milk. I also increased the number of bananas and used 3.5 Turned out perfect and everyone loved it! Thanks for a super recipe! :)

This recipe took forever!!!!  I would definitely use corn starch instead of the flour if I ever wanted to try this again.  It ended up runny and just altogether not very good.  Sorry, but I was very disappointed...

I can't believe how easy it was.  And the best part was that it tasted homemade.  Makes you want to turn your nose up towards Jello puddings!

What a wonderful recipe...this banana pudding tasted just like the recipe my daddy used to make when i was a child.  He was a wonderful cook, and passed away in1990...and I didn't have the recipe.
Banana pudding was his favorite!  Thanks for the wonderful trip down memory lane!

My husband thought my banana pudding was better than his Mom's, so I couldn't possibly let him find out that I used this recipe......LOL!!!
I did make a couple of changes though.  I found that it takes about 1 1/2 boxes of vanilla wafers and a good bit more banana slices and pudding for the size dish recommended.

Great Recipe! It was so easy to make and tasted great. I loved the banana flavor and the wafers got nice and mushy. I crumbled my wafers rather than keeping them whole and this worked out great. It took awhile for it to firm up, but it was worth the wait! I really enjoyed this pudding and it can be served with any meal or as dessert. I will definitly make this again soon!

At first, I didn't know how this would turn out.  There didn't seem to enough pudding.  But the next day when we tried it, it was a winner.  It tasted great.  Maybe next time I'll make a double batch of pudding just so we have more.
