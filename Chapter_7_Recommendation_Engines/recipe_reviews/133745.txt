I made this on a large family camping trip this weekend and everyone liked this recipe.  It was a bit spicy for some, but others thought it was perfect.  There were not many leftover, but the little bit that was left went together great with our eggs the next morning.  Will make this again.

These are absolutely fantastic! Follow the recipe exactly and DO NOT cook in the oven. It just isn't the same. I have made them several times and when one son is visiting I have to leave out the peppers and these are still great. The kids love them too! ( don't forget that alcohol cooks out)I get requests to make them at least 8 or 10 times a summer! Thanks for a great recipe!

Oh wow what a great recipe. I used red potatoes and cut the recipe down as it was to much for just my wife and I. Will make this again for sure.

WOW!! Extrremely easy, and very, very good, even for a non beer drinker like myself. This was another night were hubby was bringing his co-workers home for dinner, I remembered this recipe, but I didn't have any of the "peppers" so I made everything except the peppers. It smelled soooooooo good, and the potatoes melted in you mouth. Definately a keeper, and next time I will try it with the peppers.

I think these were pretty good, even if I did make them in the oven.  They had a very tangy, distinctive flavor.

I made these for a cookout-- forgot to take the cheese--but they were really good without--the pickiest eater went back for 2nds---- then the next night I made meatballs-- browned in a skillet and put in the leftover Beer Spuds--heated through and sprinkled  that cheese I had forgotten the night before. My family thought they were having some great new recipe-- not leftovers!

Wow!  This recipe was awesome!  I was looking for something new to cook on my grill and found this recipe.  I, too, cut the recipe in half and I used Cajun seasoning for the salt-free spicy seasoning.  My husband, who really isn't a pepper fan, really loved it and had three helpings!  I used mostly red, yellow and orange peppers with just a little green pepper for color.  We had enough leftovers (for the 2 of us) for dinner tonight! I just betcha this would be tasty with smoked sausage or Keilbasa cooked in it, too!  Yum!  Yum!  Thanks for the recipe.  I'll definately be making this again!

I made this recipe while camping. I cut everything at home and then quickly put it together while the coals where heating up. It was a hit with everyone! I do recommend a heavy duty foil pan with deeper sides. It even reheats well!

Another reviewer said these potatoes had a "distinctive flavor." That flavor is beer, and not in a tasty-addition-to-my-recipe way. The lack of salt may have contributed to the bland taste of these potatoes, I think the beer could be cut in half and chicken stock could add a little more depth of flavor. Tried to rescue the potatoes as leftovers by frying them and adding salt and seasoning, but I still couldn't get over the BEER taste. Of the 5 of us in my family, highest rating was 1/2 a thumbs up by my son who will eat anything.

The potatoes took about two hours and we had to take off the foil to get them to thicken up.  They were so spicy they were hard to eat, also, once the spice taste was gone there was nothing more to the flavor.  No flavor, just spicy.  If I made them again, I would cut the recipe in 1/2 and try less spicy seasoning and more salt.

Very good, easy recipe.  I cut the recipe in half and used garlic, lemon pepper and italian seasoning.  That's what I had to work with.  I only used 1 can of beer.  And didn't have any peppers.  They were still very good and cooked in less than 45 minutes.  Had company for dinner and everyone really liked them!!

These are FANTASTIC !!  They are a great summer recipe since you cook them on the grill so you dont have to heat your house up by using the oven.  My picky boyfriend loves these, Girls love them to !!  I cut the spicy seasoning in half and use only one type of pepper ( whatever I have on hand usually green pepper ) and I only use 1/2 the pepper and 1/2 a onion.  I have been aske for this recipe over and over again.

Big hit at this weekend's Bbq. Made a couple modifications based on personal tastes.  Used 3 8oz pacakges cheese and 2 cans beer. Also used simply potatoes brand diced steakhouse potatoes in order to avoid the work of cutting up the vegetables. They come pre seasoned with onion and garlic so they worked out very well for this recepie.

Everytime i make these they are devoured.  I make them often and always make them in a aluminum roasting pan, on the grill, with ONE can of beer (unless im making a large amount).  I follow the recipe exactly and have never had any complaints.  they are even good reheated
