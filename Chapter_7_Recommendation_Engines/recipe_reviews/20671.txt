Had to make a number of changes to this recipe for it to work. Didn't have fresh figs so I used very fresh, plump, dried ones, and marinated for 30 minutes: worked just fine.  The amount of cognac in this recipe is 1)enough to make you very intoxicated as you taste test before filling the figs!: 2)makes for a very runny filling even when doubling the amount of mascarpone, and adding more confectioners sugar.  The next time I make it I'll cut the amount of cognac in half or use brandy for a less overpowering taste, and increase the amount of confectioners sugar to 3/4 or 1 c.  I prefer a thick filling that you can actually pile on top of the fig without it falling off as you roll them in the hazelnut mixture.  Also, I prefer the filling to be proportionate to the amount of fig; about 1:1 ratio.  The macerating is the fastest and easiest way to do this, and works with fresh or dried figs.  I'm hoping next time it'll rate 5 stars in my discerning mind (although people loved it this way too!)

- these are a wee bit messy for a dinner party but are very yummy and are worth the hassle.
- fresh figs are in season during sept/oct.
- i didn't have all ingredients on hand so the substitutions i made were: sweet marsala wine and macadamia nuts.  
- make a mascarpone/spirits mixture suited to your taste by making a test batch with 1T cheese and 1T liquer 1/2T sugar. i tried brandy and found it was too strong for me and then i tried the marsala and found it to be much more palatable.
- the mascarpone/liquer mixuture was soupy in the proportions in the recipe so it was difficult to actually 'stuff' the figs. it is easier to dip the cut side of the fig in the mascarpone mix and then immediately dip the the same side in the nuts. 
- definitely chill before serving.

The only reason this does not get 5 stars is because the procedure is soooo messy.  If you make this recipe in the fall, when figs are in season, the result will be incredibly tasty and worth any effort.  I have made this several times and have yet to figure out a way to make the figs look pretty once they are stuffed.  The mascarpone is just not firm enough to stay on top of the figs, and it runs a little. Nonetheless, I will make this again and again for parties because everyone seems to love the unique taste.

I would have rated 5 but the amounts are way off.
This was a huge hit at a garden party. Other folks mentioned how messy it was to eat, so I experimented before hand (it was a tough job, but someones got to do it:) Basically used the same ingredients, just not in the amounts indicated. The cognac is really good choice because the flavor comes through without using a lot, add as much cognac to the cheese without making it runny. Add some confectioners sugar. Refrigerate cheese mixture while getting the figs ready. Wash and dry figs, trim stem off, slice in half. I had a little plastic syringe that I filled with some cognac and I squirted some in each of the fig halves. I then took a regular teaspoon (not a measuring spoon) and put approx. 1/2 teaspoon cheese mixture on each fig, being careful to not add too much (don't let it go to the edges). Then I turned over, pressing the cheese side of the fig into a dish of chopped macadamia nuts. Then placed on my serving platter, and placed in the refrigerator until serving time. I also used a decorative spoon for people to use when picking up their figs. I will definitely make again. Oh-I didn't use any mint.

Had a guest with a nut allergy, so had to leave hazalnuts off. Too sweet and strong. Only 1 guest out of 12 cared for it.
