I used monteray jack cheese and reduced fat cream cheese. Only coated them twice. Made 100 and put them in the freezer. I bake mine at 350 until cheese is hot and bubbly.........mmmmmmm....yummy!! I prefer baked not fried.

Wonderful recipe Heather.  Thank You.  I blanched my peppers in almost boiling water for 2 minutes.  Then cooled them before filling.  The peppers were just right, not too crunchy, not too soft.  I did cook my bacon before adding it to the cheese mixture.  Next time I will add more bacon.  Also, after seeding the peppers they are not very spicy, so I think I will use Jalapeno cheese with the cream cheese for a little kick.  I also sprinkled them with salt after they were fried.  My husband wanted to eat the whole batch right then.  I hope they freeze well, I want to use them when we go to an RV rally.  Thanks a bunch for a great recipe.

Awesome recipe!  The triple dipping process is a little time consuming, but the outcome is great.  They freeze really well.  After fying them I allowed them to cool, then put them on a cookie sheet and put them in the freezer for a few hours.
Once they were frozen I stored them in a freezer bag.  I reheated them at 425 degrees for about 15 minutes.  They came out great and reheating them softened the pepper.

WOW!  This recipe is THE BEST.  Just like a restaurant.  Triple coating and letting each coat "set" is key.  Time consuming, but totally worth the effort. My only changes are that  I use real bacon that I chop up and I blanch the peppers for 2 or 3 minutes before I stuff them.  I grow jalapenos in my garden so I wait until I have a LOT of them and I increase this recipe as needed.  Then I flash freeze the poppers BEFORE frying.  Throw them into a freezer bag and whenever I want some poppers I can fry up as many or as little as needed. They are just as awesome from the freezer and You can get all the hard work done in one day! Thank you for this crowd pleaser!!!

These were very eye appealing little goodies and very palatable.  I was a little disappointed there was no heat to them.  I suppose by eliminating the seeds you lose the hot effect. I will definately make them again with two small changes. Would use shredded pepperjack cheese to recapture the heat and seasoned bread crumbs, great breading but quite bland. Otherwise it's a keeper.

These poppers were the absolute best!  I made a quick horseradish dipping sauce and it was just like my favorite restaurants.  I used 1/2 c. mayo, 3/4 TBS. Katchup, 2TBS. horseradish, 1/4 tsp. paprika, 1/4 tsp. salt, and 1 dash black pepper.  My husband loved them...can't wait to take them to a party!  Thank you so much.  :)

I fixed these for a New Year's party last year and panicked becase I thought I lost the recipe! These are fantastic! These are great to make ahead and then freeze. Once they were hard, I popped them into a gallon freezer bag and we can take them out as we please without going through the hassel of preparing them. They cook great from frozen.

I was sooooo disappointed with these!! After reading all the reviews, it just seemed to scream out 5 star, but these were definitely not! I used real bacon, jalapeno monterey jack cheese for a kick, and still the filling was completely bland.  The whole thing was bland!! Will NOT be making these again!! Sorry.

The best popper recipe EVER!  I had to use swiss cheese instead of cheddar because my husband doesn't like cheddar.  If you like the heat, add the seeds and membrane (to your liking) to the cheese mixture.  Also, I like to add garlic powder to the flour....can't go wrong there.  This is a HUGE request for football season...as my hub has the guys over for EVERY game.  Fabulous!!  Thanks Heather.

I've been looking for a recipe for Jalapeno poppers and this one is a restaurant specialty in my kitchen! Fresh Jalapenos work wonderful in this recipe, I got mine right out of the garden. Beware though, DEFINITELY USE GLOVES! I didn't the first time and now I be sure to. Also, I found that it's best if cooking in a skillet on the stove to use shortening and be sure that it is at least deep enough to cover the entire jalapeno and stuffing. If you don't, you'll have to "flip them" in the oil and all the stuffing bubbles out. My whole family enjoyed these little babies, including my husband, who is very hard to please! Definitely try these for your next cook out, tailgate party, or just plain snack time. They're a real treat!

Made these and thought it was one of my crowning culinary accomplishments. It took quite a bit longer than I guessed and a lot more japelenos than I thought, (had to go back to the store) I had more cheese mixture than anything, so I hope it helps someone if I say make sure you have plenty of bread crumbs, flour, milk and peppers. But I was glad I made them, because now I have a freezer with many delicious appetizers ready for guests and/or my boyfriend who loved them. Left some seeds in and used pepper jack with cheddar and cream cheese because we like them good and hot. 
P.S. I wanted to add to this review, there are about three things that I neglected to say, first I used Turkey bacon in place of pork and I've not yet tasted bacon in these poppers so it doesn't add to the recipe to do that. Next when I said I left some seeds in, this made them Very Hot, it's great. Lastly, it would probably work better to boil the pepper a little first, like some reviewers have suggested because although they're good aldente, the breading separates when you bite them. I would think it would work better to have them softer.

So far we have ate about 100 in the past week! I'm sure we will be eating these for years to come. We also tried with just backing in the oven, don't dip in milk just put the bread crums on top and bake for 30 minutes at 300f. They were great too just without the oil.

These are excellent!  I made these earlier tonight and I swear my mouth is still burning.  Hubby's a heat-freak so I was pretty shocked hear "hot, hot, hot" through a mouth full of pepper. And while that has more to do with the peppers you buy than anything, these absolutely did not lack in flavor.  I used fresh crumbled bacon and a lot of it.  I also threw just a teeny bit of chipotle powder and ground pepper into the flour and then threw some ranch powder into plain breadcrumbs to balance things out and add a little "zing". You'll probably use a lot more milk, flour and crumbs than called for so be prepared.  When deseeding/deveining the peppers don't forget to use gloves if you have them or even plastic wrap around your hands, a teaspoon to help scrape and wash up often! I don't fry much (still a bit intimidated by scalding hot oil) and thanks to a later start I wasn't going there tonight.  So I parboiled the peppers for about 3 minutes before stuffing and then baked at 350 for about 25 minutes or so until I started to see a little cheesy leak or two.  Then I broiled a few minutes to crisp up the tops. They were perfectly tender and gooey.  Next time maybe I'll brave the hot oil, but either way there will definitely be a next time.  And while there were a lot of steps to this recipe they weren't overly complicated.  Well worth the effort, especially if you make enough to freeze for later. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made these for 2012 Super Bowl and they were a hit. A little tip for separating the hot from the mild poppers...for those who like them "hot," when you split them in half keep the stem on that half with the seeds intact. Let your guests know those with a stem are hot and those w/o are mild. this way everyone gets to enjoy them!

This IS absolutely the BEST recipe. They were gone in 5 min xmas morning. I left out the bacon bits and used japanese panko crumbs so they were very crispy. kept them warm in a very hot oven (425) so they stayed crispy until I served them. I do sometimes microwave the peppers for 2 min to get them a bit soft but I have also made them straight w/ o pre cooking the peppers. They have a bit more structure and crunch.


12/20/15.  I want to add an update. I froze the uncooked poppers then I took them out and sprayed them with a bit of oil. I pre heated the oven to 425 and baked them. They came out crispy. Its important to pre heat the oven. I let some come to room temp and some I did frozen and both were fine. I make them in batches and freeze them and then you can take a few out just for yourself at anytime w/o the fuss of frying. Hope this helps

This recipe truly deserves more than 5 stars! I followed the recipe as written, and deep fried, they are fabulous! I found that blanching them first is not necessary if using a deep fryer. I tried one immediately after cooking, and it still had some crunch to it which was fine. After they sat about 3-5 minutes, the pepper was perfectly cooked. I didn't have any problems with cheese leakage, except for a few from the whole bunch I made. That was my fault for turning my back while they were frying. Very important to let these dry about 15 minutes between breading. I found that to be crucial. I will never make another popper recipe again. These disappeared so quick! Thanks for this delicious recipe :)

These are the best pepper poppers ever. The process is time consuming, but so worth it.  If you like them hot, leave some of the veins and seeds in or mix some back in with the cream cheese mixture before stuffing them.  To make the stuffing process easier, roll the cheese mix up like a snake (like you would do with Play-Doh).  Thanks for this great recipe.

AMAZING! We loved them! We also like them HOT!!! Jalapenos are hard to judge there heat though before you actually bite into them! So I added some of the seeds back into the cream cheese mixture! I also have fried a lot of food and I ALWAYS season my flour! This time I used a creole seasoning! ITs spicey and adds a little salt as well. One more thing dont be afraid to STUFF them! I wasnt sure if you could put to much so I kind of held back a little! Next time I will load them up!

YUMM! I am having a fiesta inspired party this weekend, so I made this recipe in advance (all but frying). Of course I had to taste test and delicous they were. I BAKED the samples just to see and they were great (350 for 30 minutes, after refridgerating overnight). I will try frying them this weekend to compare. The only thing I did different was I used pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar, and I mixed in a little Italian flat-leaf parsley, corn flakes and parmesian cheese in with the breadcrumbs I made. I also boiled the peppers for a little over a minute to soften them slightly. They were G-O-O-D!

I have made about 10 different poppers recipes and this is by far the best.  I recieved many compliments and they all disappeared.  I would agree that more bacon is needed.  Last time I made this recipe, I added about half a bottle of bacon bits and it was perfect.  Also, make sure you abide by the wait times, it is necessary for the breading to stick properly.

From the land of fresh Hatch chills, you make this much too complicated.  Been making these for years, but just recently found a stuffed chili holder at World Market that makes it a little easier,(it includes a great chili corer) depending on how large your jalapeños are. First off, core them & remove the seeds.  No boiling...soak them in milk for 1/2 hour,(doesn't kill the heat, just tempers it) insert a mozzarella string cheese stick,to size, wrap a partial piece of bacon around the chili, insert a tooth pick to hold, stand up in holder or lay on foil on baking sheet & bake at 350 for about 30-45 min. There's plenty of fat with the melted cheese & bacon, so I wouldn't fry them.
Oh, if you want to split one side to stuff it, you can also add a tailless shrimp inside & the bacon will hold it closed.  I never freeze them, just make what I need.  And they are always a hit.

This is a great recipe.  I followed other review advice and upped the flavours a little.  I used locally made onion-garlic cream cheese, cooked up thick sliced bacon at home (instead of bacon bits), and chopped it up, used whole wheat flour, italian flavoured bread crumbs, organic whole milk, and sharp cheddar cheese.
I also laid them out on wax paper on a cookie sheet, and froze them after coating them.  once they were frozen i put them in a large freezer ziplock for later use.  i bake them in the oven @ 375 F (or the toaster oven), for about 10 minutes or until the cheese starts oozing out (as suggested by another reviewer)
it is also a good idea to blache the peppers before stuffing them, i usually don't, and they have a little crunch, but i don't mind this. and also: if you like them real spicy, keep some of the pepper seeds in your mixture. and if you have any mixture left, you can use it just like regular cream cheese :-)

I just spent most of my day making these.  I grew my own jalapenos this summer in the garden, and I have saved most of them for this recipe.  I would harvest them, put them into a plastic bag, and stored them in the fridge.  They do get moist, so I made sure to put in a paper towel so that the peppers stay crisp.  Some of the first that I harvested stayed perfectly well for the past few weeks this way!

I had twenty jalapenos, so I made forty poppers.  This recipe was the perfect amount for the number of peppers I had.  No leftover cheese filling at all! 

I cut and seeded the jalapenos - Make sure to WEAR GLOVES!  Next, I did take up another reviewers advice and I blanched the pepper halves in near-boiling water for 2 minutes. 

I put them all upside down on a rack and let them dry.  While they dried, I mixed the filling (I used more bacon).  I blotted the peppers with paper towel and then stuffed them.  Next, I followed the directions to a T - I dipped each pepper in milk (I used skim) and flour. I let them dry for a half hour.

Next, I dipped it in the milk and breadcrumbs and let them dry another half hour.  Finally, I dipped them in the milk and breadcrumbs once more and let them dry another half hour.  

I am going to freeze all the peppers for our next party, but had to try one.  I took another reviewers advice and baked the popper in the toaster oven, at 375, until the cheese was oozing out.  

What an incredible recipe! I thoroughly enjoyed this popper.  THANK YOU!

I loved these and so did my family. i added more bacon as others suggested and baked mine instead. A hint to those that found these mild - When picking a Jalapeño chilies know that they progressively get hotter the older they get. As they age, they develop white lines and flecks, like stretch marks running in the direction of the length of the pepper. The smoother the pepper, the younger, and milder it is. The more white lines, the older and hotter. Also for those who found them bland I suggest seasoning your flour some.

The was a great recipe! I added about 3 tbsp of bacon bits rather than one, also soft-boiled the jalapeno halves for 2 minutes and in the water, I put a pinch or two of the seeds  to make it spicy, and I double-dipped each popper in the flour and bread crumbs, so I needed about 2 cups of each. These freeze great too. This is best served with ranch dressing as the dip.

This recipe is good!  I substituted pepper jack cheese for half of the cheddar, but they're still a little lacking in flavor, in my opinion.  I think next time I might use a little less cream cheese and a little more pepper jack cheese, and maybe a little more cheddar.  You pretty much have to use at least some cream cheese to hold the filling together, though.  For the breading, I used Japanese style bread crumbs (called Panko).  I *HIGHLY* recommend this breading.  It is so crispy, and it supposedly absorbs less oil, so it's more healthy.  If it's not available in your regular grocery store, you can definitly find it in any Asian market or specialty store (it's not expensive).  I give the three-step breading technique 5 stars.  I was always nervous about the idea of making poppers before I tried this recipe because I thought the cheese would leak out all over the place, but when I found this recipe I decided to try it... with no leaks at all!  Excellent recipe overall.  I would definitely recommend it.

These are great!!!  I used fresh peppers and added some cayenne pepper and rendered bacon to the cream cheese mixture.  Although they do freeze, they are much fresher tasting then when frozen.  These are the best that I have made  Hands Down.  Try these you won't be dissapointed.

A tip to keep some of the heat is to put some of the seeds into the cheese mixture. I used all of the seeds from two peppers and they had just enough kick for me.

I'm giving this recipe three stars because it lacked flavor and the amount of ingredients needed was wrong.

I used fresh jalapenos straight from my garden and followed the recipe exact... at first. 

The recipe calls for way too much of the cheese mixture and not enough milk, flour and bread crumbs.

The breading process was a bit too much work but... it's the best breading I've ever done! 

So in the future if I ever decide to make these again I will use an 8oz package of cream cheese and two cups of the milk, flour and bread crumbs. I will add something to it for FLAVOR too. 

This recipe was too much work and not enough flavor.

left out the bacon..seasoned cream cheese with a little garlic and salt.  I deep fried the first four and the pepper was too crispy, so I put the rest in a 350 degree oven and baked for 40 minutes.  THey were much better that way.

Excellent and delicious, very time consuming dish. I followed other reviews suggestings: boiling jalapeno's whole for 4 minutes. I had trouble seeding them, becuase they were SO spicy it burnt and I was nearly coughing 1/2 way through.  I didnt half these jalapenos. I cut a slit down the middle and loaded the filling which reduced leakage (to nothing) while cooking.  I also heard some reviews these werent spicy enough so i added tabasco, but BE CAREFUL because i may have added a lil much and they were SO incredibly spicy.  I also recommend using the horseradish dip recipe posted in earlier reviews if you want to add an extra kick and opt not to use tabasco (probably smarter).

I made 32 and it took closer to 1hr 45 mins.

These are the best poppers ever!!  My husband and I made these for a New Years Eve Party and we won the appetizer contest!!! The only changes we made were: we added a little more bacon bits to the mixture, and we only dipped the jalapenos into the milk/ bread crumbs once. We also added Pampered Chef SouthWestern seasoning mix to the plain bread crumbs. We also froze the poppers ahead of time and fried them the night of the party. We had a chipolte jelly to dip them into. They were fantastic and we will definitely make them again and again. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I thought these were a little bland, but they were well-received at my party.  I followed the recipe, but added more bacon pieces after tasting the filling.  Even so, I still couldn't taste the bacon in the finished product.  I used panko bread crumbs for extra crunch.  I only rolled them in the bread crumbs once, as I ran out of time.  I couldn't bring myself to fry them, so I baked them at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  Reduced fat cream cheese or neufchatel works well in this recipe.

These were tasty. I do want to blanch the peppers next time though. I didn't like that they were still crunchy. NOTE: I found that 12oz figures out to be about 15 peppers if that is helpful.  Next time I might serve with a dipping sauce as others have done. All in all pretty tasty. A definite keeper for my appertizer/game food recipe box, thanks!

These were so good! I ended up not having enough oil to fry them, so I just sprinkled breadcrumbs over the top of the stuffing and broiled them until the jalapenos were soft. I think I will make them this way again - less work and healthier. Very tasty.

This is a great recipe. Rather that purchasing bacon bits, I made my own.  One thing to mention however.  I was searching for a recipe because I had some jalapenos and needed to find something to do with them.  i found this recipe and thought it sounded great. While taking the jalapenos out of the package I noticed it had a recipe onthe back.  Imagine my surprise when the recipe is IDENTICAL!! Every word is EXACTLY the same. So....perhaps credit for this recipe should go to Rosemont Farms in BocaRaton FL instead

I, like many others have augmented this recipe. I blanched the whole peppers, cooled in an ice bath, sliced off the tops, halved and cleaned them. I used a cream cheese and shredded cheddar jack cheese mixture. I placed them in the freezer just long enough to firm the cheese. I proceeded with the milk and flour twice and milk and bread crumbs twice. Let them rest well between each coating! They should look as though they were battered after 8-10 minutes. Season your crumbs heavily. I used dried chives and chili powder...try anything.  I fried in veg shortening. EXCELLENT! Cripsy without cheese loss. Wear gloves when cleaning the peppers and do not place frozen peppers in hot oil! This is laborious but well worth it.

These were a huge disappointment. First of all, we found this way too time consuming. Secondly,  the poppers were as crunchy as if I'd just picked them off the plant, (wished I'd blanched them first) thirdly, we found the recipe a bit bland even tho we added some cayenne pepper and lastly, the breading came off as we took our first bite. I'm glad everyone else had success with this recipe but it looks like this gal will stick to the boxed version. Thank you anyway!

This is a good recipe with room to play!   I leave out the bacon (not the flavor I wanted), add a couple cloves of garlic, 1 tsp onion powder and maybe 1/2 tsp salt to cream cheese mix. I pipe the filling using a zip lock bag, less mess!   I use panko bread crumbs for the second dip, and fine bread crumbs for the third dip, and sprinkle the poppers with salt before the third drying... very crunchy, very good!   My husband is an absolute FIEND for these, and after trying several recipes, this is the one we've settled on as our favorite.  Thanks for such a good post!

Just wanted to throw in my two cents.  Great recipe!  This has definitely become a household favorite.  For those who want a little extra spicy in theirs, save a few of the seeds and add them to the cream cheese.  I seeded 100 and saved about two tablespoons of seeds, which gave the poppers a great kick when done.  I also first fried mine, then froze them, reheating them for 10 minutes at 400F.

Made these for Super Bowl and they were sooo tasty.  I used real bacon and followed all instructions re:  dipping/dbl dipping.  I thought I'd try baking them for ease of preparation but I found that they didn't brown or crisp up at all so I axed that idea and switched to the frying method for that golden, crunchy texture.  If you are thinking of baking, just something to keep in mind.  Also, from experience in the past, I find that blanching the peppers leaves them with little to no heat, which kind of defeats the purpose of the Jalapeno Popper.  They are supposed to have some "snap" to them, right?!  And then the cream cheese helps cool the palate!  So, long story short--don't blanch them first and deep fry them.  Let go of health concerns for one day:)  Oh another thing is that after I filled the peppers with cheese I put them in the freezer for 10 minutes to firm up again.  This made the dipping process really easy!  Hope this helps you too :)

I cannot see how anyone could make this recipe and have it come out "bland" unless they got the wrong type of pepper by mistake! I made these today with home grown Jalapeno peppers. I used 1/2 cheddar and 1/2 colby-jack cheese, and skipped the bacon bits. They came out very spicy, and very tasty. Instead of cutting the peppers all the way in half, I just slit them down one side and pulled out the seeds. The filling was easy to spoon in, and then each "popper" maintained its shape nicely.  If you don't want to deep fry them, it works just as well to fry them in a large skillet, gently turning them over during cooking to brown all sides evenly.

My husband and I put aside an entire day for this recipe.  We gather all the jalapenos in our garden and have a "popper-making party".  After the peppers are breaded we freeze them on trays and then vacuum seal them (12 per bag).  To defrost, remove from bag and they will unstick as they become room temeperature.  If you try to defrost them in the bag, the breading will stick.  We've actually had our friends tell us we should go into business selling these.  Yummy!

I blanched the peppers for 2 minutes before stuffing, and I also baked mine at 350 for 25 minutes.  They were great right out of the oven.  My husband had some when they were cold and tried to reheat in the microwave and he didn't care for them.  I will try again with different types of cheese.

awesome! I had about 8 jalepenos from my garden that needed using up. I only used half the cream cheese/cheese/bacon bits called for, and I could have halved that again cause I had ALOT left over. I only dipped in milk and breaded them once and they still were awesome. I'm sure repeating that step would have made them even better, but you don't really need too. My only recommendation is to start frying them on the cheese stuffed side first so that the mix doesn't get too melty and fall out when you flip them in the oil. Very good recipe! Will be using this one again!

These were good, but it seemed to me it was lacking something in flavor. I will make these again but I will have to fiddle around with the recipe.

I'm new to Allrecipes.com and this will be my first review. These jalapeño poppers were so delicious and crunchy I loved them. I followed the recipe exactly as it is given. I also made some homemade ranch sauce to go with these. Making these was very time consuming but worth it. I recommend seeding them and filling them a night before. I followed the advise from others and added seeds to the filling, even so these were not at all spicy. Next time I will add lots more because we love spicy food. Also, have someone help you out and that will make the process faster. I can't wait to make them again and eat them again.

Would give these 10 stars if I could! I only made one change, after slicing the peppers in half lengthwise and seeding them, I preboiled them for 5 mins. I also put some of the seeds in the pot while boiling them to add heat back to the peppers. The bacon bits really make these stand apart from all the rest. These are worth the effort. Make ahead and freeze for a treat anytime.

I've never made poppers before this, and I probably never will again as I found it to be a lot of work!! They were very tasty but my kitchen was overwhelmed with spiciness that had us all coughing.  I think blanching the peppers is a must or they may turn out a bit too crisp.  Let them cool for the flavors to fully develop. The triple dip process made mine turn out huge[not a bad thing!].  Freezes well, pop them in the micro for a minute.  Yummy!!!

These were awesome and surprisingly not too hard to put together.
*I tried these a second time but with some changes for what I had on hand. I guess you could say they really aren't like the recipe. I used a can of diced jalapenos and some extra cheese. I also added a tbl of bacon fat from when i baked them for these. Mixed all toether and rolled into balls. I rolled the ball in flour and then dipped in milk and breaded like usual. I did 3 coats to ensure the mixture stayed it. I baked them and they tasted great, but I do suggest frying them because they get a more solid crust.

This is the best recipe I have ever tried!!!  My family askes for these at every gathering.  I have to buy my jalapenos when they are on sale and make them up ahead of time.  The smallest batch I have ever made was 100.  The largest was for my daughters graduation party which was 500.  Thanks again.

Me and my boyfriend love these jalapeno poppers.They are by far the best we have ever had.I think the bacon does something extra special for these mouth watering treats.we usually make a lot of them and freeze them in baggies to eat anytime we are in a rush.but I learned my lesson the hard way,do USE GLOVES!!!!They are best when served with ranch or salsa!

These little poppers take some time to prepare, but it's worth it. I prefer baked  rather than fried, so this is wonderful. I like the chedder flavor. The corn cereal needs to be high quality or it turns out to be a little rubbery.

Great recipe. I just wanted to do plain poppers and so I only filled the jalepenos with cream cheese and omitted the bacon and extra shredded cheese. I am sure they would be delicious with those added though. Thanks!

These were pretty good. My jalapenos weren't spicy at all so it wasn't the best. Also, there was way too much filling and I needed more milk, flour and bread crumbs to bread them. But everyone enjoyed them overall. I just need to find a way to get better jalapenos and maybe cut down on the filling a little. Maybe use pepper jack cheese next time.

Great peppers, enjoyed them very much! If you are having trouble with coating the peppers, try putting them in the freezer for about 20 minutes before dipping them in the milk.

I made this as an appetizer for my nephews first birthday.  It was awesome.  I changed only a few things.  I didn't put as much cheddar cheese as was called for because I didn't have it.  Next time I think I will put the right amount and see how much chessier it is.  I also baked these instead of frying them.  I made them ahead of time and baked them at 350 for 20 minutes then I let them cool and froze them.  The night before the party I let them thaw and baked them the next day at 350 for about 25 minutes.  I also sprayed them with cooking spray before baking them so they would get a little crispy.  These came out awesome served with some buttermilk ranch sauce.  I made about 70 and they all disappeared.

HIGHLY overrated. My friend has been talking up this recipe for years and I just wasn't impressed. They were ok, but I ended up throwing most of them away. The cream cheese mixture needed a little something. I just felt there was something missing. I also don't like the whole frying factor. I should have taken another posters advice & baked them instead of fried them.

Just made these!!  The breading technique in this recipe really gives a good, crispy coating to the poppers.  

I did alter the recipe a bit to taste, but I do that with most recipes, and this is a really great recipe b/c it can be tweaked to fit personal preference.

I didn't opt to do anything to the peppers prior to, such as blanching, and I did BAKE instead of FRY (350 for 25 min, and broiled for 2-3 mins).

Much better than pre-made ones in the freezer section of your grocey store.  Yes, they are bit time consuming to prepare but the effort is worth it.  I added garlic powder and cracked pepper to season the flour.  Make a big batch, they freeze great.

"Cant get them any better in any restaurant" was my hubbys reaction to these !! We were given a bag of various peppers from a friends garden. and I hated to see them go bad. so I decided to give this a try !  It was a bit time consuming. and messy. but as soon as  we ate one we knew they would be made many times in our house! I didnt change the recipe at all . ingredients wise. But I did bake them 350 . for about 25 minutes. instead of fry them. they were crunchy, and the filling oooozed  when u bit them. DEFINATELY the BEST poppers we have had!!  ty Heather :)

I made these a while back and my husband and I both agree they are definely good.  I used panko bread crumbs instead of regular but followed the directions for the filling.  I also blanched my peppers for just a couple of minutes before filling.  Next time I make them I will not remove all of the seeds because they were not quite as spicy as we like them.  Since it is just the 2 of us, this recipe made more than we could possibly eat so I used my foodsaver to vacuum seal them and froze the rest.  When I cooked them, I baked some of them and fried some.  Both are good, but frying did taste better of course.

I made these for the second time recently and they were great! They are very time consuming and a little messy so make sure you're in the cooking mood. I highly recommend using Panko (Asian style breadcrumbs)- they stick better and are extra crispy.  I also seasoned my flour and breadcrumbs with taco seasoning. Thanks! This is definitely another keeper.

Excellent recipe.  I left out the bacon bits.  And I didn't cut the jalapenos in half as suggested...instead I sliced off the top, and scrapped the seeds out with a fillet knife.  Blanching is also a good idea because it softens them up a bit. Try a double dip thru the milk (or soy milk) & bread crumbs because extra breading is always good.  These are excellent with red pepper jelly.

Good, but make sure you dont have any plans for the day.  They take lots of time.  I would say not quite as good as the fast-food type, but close.  I'm not sure they are worth so much effort.

Great Recipe.  Everyone loved them.  I used a zester to remove as much skin as possible which allows the coating mixture to adhere to the peppers more readily. I used a suggestion from another recipe and when I cut the Jalapeno I left the stem on one half.  I removed all the seeds and saved them. I made two batches of filling and added half of the saved seeds to one batch of filling which I used to stuff the jalapenos with the stem still on. It was easy to distinguish which stuffed peppers were going to have a kick.

This is a very good dish. Despite what others said, they were very spicy. The spice comes from the jalepenos so don't blame the recipe if your jalepenos are bland. Buy better jalepenos next time.

The recipe could be improved by blanching the peppers first and adding a dash of salt to the flour. Otherwise, it's almost perfect.

Not bad, but not worth all the work either. You're better off buying a package of poppers in the freezer section.

These were wonderful!!!  A few changes I made: I didn't go crazy on getting the membranes out, just the seeds and what membrane I could easily get, so that kept them a bit spicy.  I did blanch them for 3 minutes before stuffing.  I followed the stuffing exactly but added garlic powder and extra bacon.  I used real bacon bits, not "baco bits".  I also added paprika to my flour and italian seasoning, salt and pepper to my bread crumbs. After I stuffed them, I refrigerated for 15 minutes. I like each coat rest for over 10 minutes, to give me time to clean up in between.  After the breading and resting, I deep fried for about 2-3 mintues.  They came out perfect!!!! They are cooled and in the fridge to be brought to a 4th of July party this afternoon!  I'll updated after we reheat in the oven!

Excellent poppers! I first blanched them as recommended and triple dipped. I also had some leftover cheese and just made some fried cheese balls. They were not hot at all, and I am very sensitive to heat! I omitted the bacon (this is an unhealthy meal already!) and it was marvelous! A great idea for when company comes over for a cookout.

These turned out beautifully - no cheese leakage! I did not have time to let them dry very long in between breading steps, but they still were great.  I made a raspberry dipping sauce that not everyone liked, but I loved.  The next time I make these I will try placing a cut strip of crispy bacon over the cheese mixture instead of mixing in the  bacon bits, and I may blanch the peppers first. My jalapenos were quite large and remained crunchy after cooking, which I really liked, but others prefer a softer pepper.

I do not understand what I did wrong with this recipes. I seasoned the recipe as suggested by others, but all I could taste was cream cheese...

A little  messy and time consuming .But the end result is well worth the mess and wait. I would make this again. I will also make a sweet dipping sauce for the next batch.
Peppers were blanched for 3-4 minutes.

Was hesitant to try these (especially trying to picture bacon and jalapeno together).  Opted to follow the recipe and add pepper jack cheese to the filling. These were absolutely delicious as is!  I love jalapenos and my husband just likes them. He said outside of the flavor of the pepper, they were a bit bland - but I thought the filling was the perfect compliment to the great flavor of the pepper (so that was just a preference thing) I rate it 5 b/c I love the pepper falvor and the filling my husband would rate a 4 because he thought there should have been more flavors in play other than the pepper. Too bad...More for me I guess! :)

BIG hit at the Fantasy Football draft this past Sunday.  Couple things to beware of before you start.  First, its a VERY messy operation.  Second, listen to the people who tell you to wear gloves when seeding the peppers.  I was in agony the next morning!    Here's a little helpful math for those of you who are "yield challenged" like me.  You can do about 45 to 50 pepper halves to two 8oz (the standard size "brick") packages of Cream Cheese and one 16oz package of Shredded Cheddar.

Delicious! I added back in some of the seeds for some spice.  It worked a little too well. Next time I'll add less or use pepper jack.  Overall, really good, restaurant quality poppers.  Definitely worth the time.

OK, this recipe was a good starting point, but I tweaked it a bit, and the results were a hit at my recent party.  1)  I blanched the seeded, halved peppers (2 mins in boiling water, cooling in ice water).  2)  I reserved a handful of the blanched peppers to add to the filling.  I also added white and green onions, red bell pepper, fresh garlic, chili powder, cumin, salt, and freshly ground black pepper, and upped the amount of bacon (I used real bacon ends and pieces I keep frozen for just such recipes).  After cooking the bacon pieces, I added the filling ingredients plus all my extras above to the bowl of my food processor and blended until it was a rough mixture.    3)  I filled the drained, dried pepper halves as per the recipe, but I made sure that the filling was heaped on top (probably double the amount--trust me, it will cook down).  Then, I froze the filled halves on cookie sheets until solid.  4)  I did the milk and flour coating per the recipe, but added salt and chili powder to the flour after a test fry revealed that the breading was pasty and bland.  When it came time for the second coating, I used panko.  5)  I cooked the still mostly frozen peppers in my deep fryer at 365 for about 2 minutes.  PERFECTION!!!

These are time consuming to make - but a fantastic addition to a Super Bowl Party or similar type event where finger foods are necessities.  My cheese ended up being a blend of Colby/Mont Jack, and it was fine.  I baked at 350 for 30 min (until bubbly) like others, and no one missed it being deep fried.

My hubby just loved these... he couldn't stop eating them!  I chose to add a few ingredients from the Sausage Jalapeno Popper recipe on this site.  I added 1 lb. cooked sausage to the mixture, omitted the bacon bits, and increased the cream cheese to 2 packages.  I baked these at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes then put them under the broiler for a few minutes to crisp them up.  I was very grateful for the triple dipping process... it made the coating stick very well!  AWESOME appetizer... hubby said he could make a meal out of them with addition of the sausage.  Don't forget to wear gloves... I did and paid for it all evening!

this is a great recipe. the breading prosses is messy but well,well worth it! I used garden vegatable flavor cream cheese and left out the bacon bits. I was also worried about the pepper being to crunchy because some blanched them before stuffing them. they were great! just the right amouint of crunch. thanks!!

These are absolutely fabulous! Pleanty of flavour, taste, kick, yummyness. I think Mrs RPM was using very old ingredients which had lost all their flavour, this certainly doesn't taste bland.

Great! This was my first attempt at making jalapeno poppers, and they turned out just wonderfully. I'm generally not into this kind of fried snack food, but I wanted my Italian boyfriend to try them for the first time. Due to our international status, I was forced to use a number of substitutions. I used pancetta instead of bacon, which I fried a bit and then coarsely minced. Instead of cheddar I used a mix of a mild, fresh pecorino  and provolone piccante. I can't get jalapenos in my area either, but I did find some long, red chili peppers which worked perfectly. The real kicker that makes this recipe work so well is the breading. It's perfect -- worth following to a "t". Great recipe. I will be keeping this in my collection. Thanks!

So many great reviews....I had high hopes but I found these to be very boring and bland.  I left the pith in and blended a few seeds into the cheese and got a little glow but overall just not worth the effort.The crusty coating is very good when deep fried;then I experimented with baking at 350 as one reader recommended. The result was a flaky loose crust which I felt was unsatisfactory
There's better stuff out there!

These were delicious! I took the advice of some of the reviewers and I added bacon bits and cilantro to filling. The cilantro really helped bring the flavors together. I made them for the first time last night, and I'm considering buying 50 jalapenos so I can freeze 100 for the upcoming football games!

I made the poppers with Panko instead of the bread crumbs to keep them crispy. I dipped them in milk and then in flour, but I dipped them into (a beated) egg to keep the Panko on it better. I had family and friends try it...they loved it and asked for the recipe!
2ND TRY: This time I halved and seeded the peppers and cooked them in boiling water for 3 minutes. I used bread crumbs this time around; the poppers didn't stay as crunchy as the Panko ones did. The peppers were softer since I blanched them. But the cheese mixture had a weird texture that I didn't like (both times), so I think next time I will use less cream cheese?

Flavor is good but for some reason the flour didn't hold on to well using.  I'll try buttermilk next time or half and half and add a little bit of bread crumbs to the flour mixture.

These were awesome!!  Everybody loved them!!  I added some salt and garlic powder to the bread crumbs, brushed them with butter, and baked them for 30 minutes at 350.  I didn't have bacon, so I left that out.  These were well worth the time and effort!!!

Time consuming (of course) so I think you should make a bunch to freeze.  Double coat for sure!  I didnt need gloves, but my hands take a beating all the time.  Not as messy as you might think, but a lot of dishes!  I did boil the jalapenos for a minute or so to soften them.  Great recipe, very versatile.  TRY IT!

After reading the reviews I knew it would be a tedious and messy ordeal-and it was. BUT it was worth it. I set aside quite a bit of time and had an assembly line of jalapenos in various stages all going at once. I was grateful for the suggestion of blanching them to soften them, I also added more cheddar, some chili powder and added some garlic powder to the flour/bread crumb mixture. I double dipped and deep fried and they were perfect. I will definately be making these again soon although I will double the recipe and freeze some.

I made these a couple of days ago with some fresh jalapenos that I pulled out of the garden.  My breadcrumbs were tortilla crumbs that I found at the grocery store and they worked wonderfully.  As others have said, they do take some work, but are well worth the effort. --- I can also vouch for their freezability.  I froze them uncooked and then pulled them out again a few days later and dropped them into my FryBaby.  I would almost venture to say they were better after being frozen.  I will surely make these again, they were just fabulous.  I missed the spiciness, but because they were not spicy, my kids ate them and that was a plus.

Perfect, except i had problem with the cheese escaping from the jalapeno's. Some would keep it in, the others wouldnt. I think im going to just cut the cap off, stuff them, and then shove the cap back inside before battering them, to see if it works better next time.

Also, I added some feta cheese to the cheese mixture. Adds a great flavor.

Oh, these ARE the best ever!! Blending the cream cheese and shredded cheddar in a food processor seemed to help. I didn't have bacon, but these still tasted terrific. I have a feeling that I too will have to make these again soon and set aside some time to make a 100 or so to freeze and have handy!

Our cooking club made these in June.  $20 Can. worth of peppers.  That is a lot of jalapenos.  We added garlic to the mix as well as a little heat.  We were probably a little heavy on the bacon as well.  We added some flavored bread crumbs to the breading.  These are a pain in the --- to make.  Especially in bulk.  In the 10 years of cooking club, this was the worse mess ever.  BUT they were a great hit.  People hovered at the grad parties.  The kids dug in the freezer for leftovers.  They were delicious.  And you need a lot if you are going to make them, people want 5ths not seconds.  They freeze very well.

When I made this, it never even made it to the table...we ate it standing up at the stove!  I just added monterey jack instead of all the cream cheese and served it with jalapeno jelly...holy smokes...one of the best (if not THE best) appetizer I have eve made...it's staying at the top of the list!

These were really good, but the jalapenos were really crunchy after frying.  I guess we should have fried, frozen, and then baked them.  The only problem with making them was that we have never made anything with jalapeno's before and had no idea that you need a face mask when you are seeding them!  The smell was so strong that my husband was coughing and had tears running down his face!  We will be making them again though!

These were great!  These are much better than the box.  Worth the extra time.  The jalapenos were still crunchy, so maybe I will blanch them next time. Thanks for the great recipe. :-)

One word, yummy!!!  I could'nt stop eating them.  Everyone was amazed I made them myself.  I cooked them ahead of time, than froze and reheated when I needed them.  I only have 6 left in the freezer, I hid them so my husband can't find them in there!  You've got to try these, you'll be hooked!

I made this for friends and family one night, and it was the hit of the party! They are fantastic!
I did make one change, but I'm certtain it's fabulous either way; I exchanged the shredded cheddar for a prepackaged "fiesta" mix of cheddar, monterey jack, and a mexican cheese (can't remember the name).
This will definitely be made many times in my household.

These are WONDERFUL! I made a batch of 120 for my first try, and although it is extremely time consuming, it's well worth it, and very very easy to do!!!  Reheating after freezing is a blessing, it softens the jalenpeno's and doesn't lose any of the taste.  I RECOMMEND making sure the oil is nice and Hot before putting the poppers into it.  It saves the cheese from running out, and the batter stays on great this way.  Otherwise, it falls off the popper a little.  I left the bacon bits out and I'm glad I did.  THANKS HEATHER!!!

I had extra large jalapeno peppers and maybe that is why they were still very crisp after frying them for 3-4 minutes. The triple coating is the best part. I seasoned the filling with salt and pepper and I used Italian bread crumbs for the coating. I will try making them again and this time I will take the advise of another reviewer and parboil them for a few minutes.  UPDATE:  just made them again and this time I parboiled the jalapenos for 7-8 minutes. The end results were fantastic.  Will always take this extra step when making them.

Made these today on a rainy day when there was not a lot else to do. Used my own garden jalapenos and followed the recipe exactly.  I prepared them, placed them in the fridge until I was ready to fry and the cooked to perfection.  Boy oh boy.  My Jalapenos are HOT!  I seeded with rubber gloves and took all precautions, but I guess jalapeno peppers depend on where they are grown, but I am going to be sorry tomorrow. I am freezing the leftover deep fried poppers and hope they are as good when reheated.  Great recipe.  Thanks!  BTW, they didn't need to be blanched at all.  Pepper skin was just as tender as if they had been blanched or roasted in advance.

I made these for the heck of it, and I was a little dissapointed because I thought they were going to be a little hot. They were not hot at all :( but they tasted good anyways. I will be putting some hot sauce "salsa rosada" on top so they taste even better. Thanks for sharing!

This is an awesome hit with everyone...the only thing that I did different was bake them instead of fry them...much healthier and the jalepenos were a little crisper...I have made these time and time again...

I did the double coating as the recipe called for and the ONLY thing I would change about this recipe is doing the triple coat, as others said. These were a big hit and worth all the effort. Will be making again for sure!

Super time consuming but amazing.
Restaurant quality if not better!
I followed the recipe exactly and next time i would mix some seeds in with the cream cheese for some heat and add some salt to the bread crumbs.
Delich!!

These were really delicious.  We used more than 1 Tbls of bacon bits, and we used real bacon.  We also used Panko breadcrumbs.  Worth the effort.  UPDATE: we made them again, baking them instead (spraying with cooking spray). They turned out even better and healthier.

Only thing I would clarify is, cut the jalapenos diagonally, not long-ways.  I used finely chopped onions as well, had no cheddar cheese but it still worked out fine! A+++++++ WOULD BUY AGAIN!!!1!
They were so hot and so  good it this happened: (?°?°)?? ???

These were INCREDIBLY delicious! I wound up giving them 3 layers of bread-crumb breading and that seems to be a good amount. It took me a bit longer to make these than the recipe claims, however.

TOTALLY WORTH IT!

I use cream cheese, minced garlic & tex mex shredded cheese and wrap the in bacon.  Or you could put bacon bits in the cream cheese, no need to rolls in crumbs just put them on a foil lined baking sheet.  The are great and less work.

I made 100 of these for a party, and they were devoured.  Substituted Japanese panko crumbs for traditional bread crumbs.  Also only had time to dredge in panko once - but they still turned out very well!  Great recipe, and remember to wear your gloves when working with this many jalapeno peppers!!

These are AWESOME! We made them exactly per the recipe except we added some cayenne pepper into the cheese mixture for a little extra zip. They were a hit and we were glad we froze 8 or 10 of them for ourselves. They are just as good frozen! Just bought the ingredients for making twice as many as last time, because it's a GREAT appetizer to have on hand in the freezer for game days!

These turned out really good. I burned the first batch, but that was because I had the burner way too high. I added extra bacon like some of the other reviews suggested. I thought this overpowered the cheese flavor. Next time I will add the suggested amount. Some people suggested adding jalapeno cheese for an extra kick. I didn’t have any so I added some juice from a jar of jalapenos. That did just the trick.

Delicious, thanks to the original poster! I (of course) modified the recipe a bit; I used equal amounts of cream and cheddar cheese (tried Tillamook cheddar once but couldn't taste the price difference) added a LOT more bacon (8 slices) and used Panko instead of the breadcrumbs for a crispier texture.  I also wasn't satisfied with the heat so I left some of the seeds and ribs in.  Try this with Habeneros for a real kick in the pants (tried this leaving the seeds in and just about burned my face off)!

These turned out fabulous! I baked them instead of frying and used panko crumbs to give them some extra crunch. I also used 1/2 cheddar cheese and 1/2 pepper jack cheese. A little time consuming but worth it. I made them in advance, stored in freezer, and then popped them into oven at 400 degrees for 15 minutes with great results.

These were awesome!!  Does anyone have any ideas for a dipping sauce to go along with them?  They were extremely good by themselves, but I was just wondering.

Absolutely perfect! I used the "Mexican Cheese" blend from the grocery store, used skim milk, and light cream cheese for it to be slightly healthier! I also baked them in the oven for 15 minutes at 350 degrees F - I sprayed the bottom of a dish with a little butter, and melted butter in the microwave, then painted a few dots on to each popper. Delicious! :) The bacon flavor was excellent and not too overpowering!

Great recipe for poppers! Here are a few hints that helped me.Use gloves while cleaning the jalapenos (I halved them first then used a spoon to scoop the seeds and membranes out), boiled them for 2 min (very necessary), chilled in ice water, dried them on paper towels, then stuffed them and mound stuffing slightly. Recipe needs more bacon then recipe states, I added 4 additional pieces of bacon.The amount of stuffing could fill at least 20 jalapenos. I ended up with 40 poppers. The three layer breading process is key but u need more breadcrumbs then the recipe states. After the first coat of breadcrumbs I ran out so I used some buttery crackers blended in the blender for second crumb coat.I fried mine in oil because I was afraid the cheese would leak out. Time consuming but worth it if you love jalapeno poppers!

Amazing! These disappeared so quickly, I hardly got to have one! I used sharp cheddar cheese, because that's what I had, and three slices of real bacon, although I really couldn't taste the bacon, so I'm not sure if it's necessary to have it. I cooked these the day before, tried one, delicious! Froze the rest, baked them at 425* for 15 minutes the next day, tasted exactly the same. I did not blanch them and they were fine. Only reason this is not a 5 star recipe is because it took WAY longer to make. Plan on spending a few hours on this one. Totally worth it, though. I served them with Ranch dressing and pizza sauce. Thanks!

These taste great, but take WAY too long to make. The prep time estimate is a lie. It doesn't take 45 mins, more like 2-3 hrs to halve, seed, mix, stuff, and hand-dredge a batch of poppers three times. If you compare making your own poppers to buying factory-made, the reward-to-work ratio is rather lousy.  Granted, that isn't a criticism of this recipe, but of making homemade poppers in general; (it's still a helpful observation for those thinking about making this.) Of course the upside is, you can add bacon or use another cheese, or make whatever other tweak you want. My point is, I started making these, thinking I would be done in 45 minutes, and I ended up having to spend more than 2 hours.  So be warned: don't start this recipe unless you have 2-3 hours to spend. Also, the 36 poppers I made only took about half the cheese filling that this recipe says goes in 32 poppers.  I froze the other half and I'll use it the next time I make them (if I ever do.)  Honestly unless your time is only worth about $3 or $4 per hour, it's cheaper, easier, and equally yummy just to buy them at Costco. As far as taste, bacon always adds flavor. It is definitely a departure from the "original" flavor I was going for, however.  Also the peppers were very firm. I think I'll try baking them for a long time at a low temp, to see if this softens them up a bit. I didn't want to blanch them as it would make them too soft to work with, plus it would have added even MORE time to the prep process.

Awesome!  I used technique from another recipe and cut the end off the pepper and scooped out the seeds and veins with a vegetable peeler, so I had whole peppers.  I upped the bacon - used real bacon and chopped it up.  I also used Monterey Jack rather than cheddar to give it a little kick.  Deep fried them - yum, yum!

These are wonderful. I grew an abundance of peppers this year and this was one of my favorite ways to use them. I thought I had plenty frozen, but they're going fast!

This is very similar to my recipe for jalapeno poppers- a GREAT one!  One suggestion for those of you interested in taking it up a notch: use smoked cheddar cheese!  Really enhances the smokiness of the bacon and adds a lot of flavor.  Makes it a bit more expensive, but trust me, it's worth it.  Also, I only do a double-dip and they come out just fine.

Made these 3 times. 1st time followed directions as written and the only disappointment was that there wasn't much heat to them, however they were still very good and went fast!  2nd time blanched the peppers and only breaded twice and left the seeds in, forgot to add the bacon but it wasn't missed and still very good.  3rd time decided to use Habeneros since I had so many in my garden...WHOA!! HOT HOT HOT!!!  Needed a lot of sour cream for this batch to help tame the heat!  Will stick with jalepenos from now on but they were still very good!  Definately will keep this recipe!

The recipe title doesn't lie!  We had, no joke, two pounds of jalapenos from two little plants in the garden.  After using the first poud for hot pepper jelly, I decided to give this recipe a go with the latest pound.  THEY ARE PERFECT.  Absolutely perfect.  It's time intensive, doing all the work alone, but I could see this going much faster as an assembly line process with a few people helping.  Regardless, it's worth the time and I'm sure this recipe will come back out of the box next year.

Is there a better name for these? No way! These are the absolute best. A little work involved, but good things come to those who wait. I made 2 dozen peppers, and in the future, plan to make a large amount and try freezing them. Thanks!

This is a great treat my children love them. I tried something different, I cut the jalapeno peppers into rings and stuffed into won ton wrappers and deep fried for about 4 min. For an added kick I put in a few drops of chipotle tabasco sauce and hot pickled jalapeno peppers. It was quicker and they freeze well.

The recipe was good, I didn't use the bacon bits and it still taste great. I blanched the peppers for 2 minutes like suggested, which made them the perfect crunch/soft texture. I got impatient and didn't do the triple dip (only dipped twice), which I wouldn't recommend. The recipe was not bland at all. Like other reviews suggested: it's all about the spice of the jalapenos. One person mentioned baking, don't try it with the recipe given. I did it to a half dozen of the peppers and they turned into a floury crunch-less waste. Also, I'd desperately recommend not only using gloves while de-seeding but also glasses (even sunglasses work)! I know it sounds crazy, but I was squirted in the eye while de-seeding one of the peppers and had to spend a half hour rinsing my eye under cold water. So be careful.

I have made these at least 5 times and have this to add. I used pickled jalapeno peppers. They are hotter and have that zing missing from fresh. I did wear gloves. Also used seasoned Panko style crumbs and sharp cheddar cheese. Subbed real bacon for fake bacon crumbles (saltier) I like HOT poppers and this really made them the best. Great recipe, I just felt a few details were missing.

I agree with all other reviews, these taste just like the poppers you buy at restaurants!
I omitted the bacon bits and used egg mixed with a little water instead of milk to dip them in and they were fantastic!
And I definitely recommend doing the triple battering!

Love this recipe!!!  Did not have bacon bits nor did I feel like frying any bacon.  I used fresh jalapeno peppers and did not blanch or broil and peel them.  I like them with a little crunch to them.  I stuffed some with the cheddar and cream cheese and some with just the cream cheese (for me, I love just the cream cheese).  They were a little time consuming but, I think the rolling, resting, rolling again and then letting them rest in the refrigerator for a while is the key to perfection.  I had cut the tops off the peppers to seed and stuff them and to my amazement none of the cheese stuffing oozed out during the frying process.  When it looked like the cheese might be ready to break out I removed them from the oil.  Used this method to fry chunks of pepper jack cheese to make cheese stick.  They turned out great, too.  Thanks for a great recipe and a wonderful technique for frying these hot but tasty morsels.  Everyone loves them.

This recipe was GREAT!  The only thing I changed was the cooking method.  Because it was sooooo hot outside (and I don't have central air) and because I was BBQing anyway, I put them in a cast iron skillet on the grill using indirect heat. There was NO oil and I believe they probably faired better with containing the cheese filling.

Best jalapeno poppers ever. My boyfriend loves the ones from Arbys and he says these taste absolutely awesome. He'd eat the whole batch standing up if I let him. I omitted the bacon as I didn't have any. Made a sweet chili sauce to go with them and were just fabulous. Making again for the Bears vs. Packers game.

These were better than any store bought jalapeno poppers. I rolled them in the milk and breadcrumbs twice to ensure a good crust. I also left most of the white membrane in the jalapeno, to give them heat. These were so good! Thank you.

This recipe is great! It is a little time consuming but I just picked a Sunday afternoon while I was watching football and took my time. I thought it would be hard to make but it was easy and they fried up so nice and freeze so well. I froze mine after I cooked them and then microwave them. They come out perfect. I think next time i will add a little green onion to them.

These were tasty.  Instead of frying, I sprayed some canola oil on them and baked at 350-375F . I also added more bacon, green onions and some onion and garlic powder. I broiled them the last minute to make them crunchy. They were time consuming to make.  I worked quickly and it still took me about 1 1/2 hrs. from start to finish.  My family liked them but I don't think I'd make these all the time just because of the time consumption.  Overall, a good recipe.

Hands down, this is the absolute BEST Jalapeno Popper recipe ever... My husband is my best sampler... but he's honest... plus I had his brother and cousin... who are also very particular say these were the best they've ever tasted!  No restaurant can compare.  I have to be honest and thought this wouldn't turn out just because usually when you dip something in milk more than once the previous stuff you rolled in would come off... but it didn't and I highly reccomend that you dip the poppers once in the flour... then do the whole process in the bread crumbs 2 times, like the recipe says to do!  I used a deep fryer and about 375 degrees... 2 minutes was perfect... I used italian bread crumbs and used jalapeno jack cheese mixed with cheddar.  No bacon bits for the vegetarians, and it was perfect... full of flavor.  I also boiled the jalapeno's for 4 minutes to remove some of the heat and they were not too hot, but had a great kick!  I will be forced to make these over and over again for all of our family occasions!  Thank you so much for sharing this fabulous recipe!

365 degrees deep fry for 2-3 minutes is NOT enough time.  Wish I would had read other posters suggestings to scald the jalapeno peppers in hot water first.  Jalapenos came out undercooked.  A disappointing disaster.

These were a big hit with everyone at my new year's eve party.  I took the advice of some and made them earlier in the day and froze them so I could fry up later. I didn't feel the need to boil the peppers first because I like crunchy veggies, plus every other time I've had poppers, the peppers are too mushy.  Everyone else agreed with this as well.

These poppers tasted awesome however the prep work took some time.  Be careful with the hot oil also; works best if made with one other person helping out.

I thought these were good, but I tried using low fat cream cheese and baked them.  Next time I will use regular cream cheese and fry them!  They froze nicely, which made for a nice treat later on.

AWESOME!!  Followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  Made a bunch and froze.  They almost looked too perfect to eat.  Time consuming, but well worth it.  The pepper is crunchy which I like.  Thanks for the excellent recipe.

These poppers took some time, but they are VERY worth the time and effort!!  I suppose if you made a smaller batch?  I think I used 100+ jalapenos!  Cleaned out my garden!!

Very easy recipe, with great results. Tastes so much better than the frozen poppers. I had tried to make my own before, but couldn't figure out how to get the coating thick enough. Now I know!Works great for cheese sticks too! Thanks! Delicious!

Pretty easy just time consuming.  Unfortunately, after changing the recipe around alittle it was still missing something.  Needed salt and some red and black pepper to spice it up.  I will try it again and change it around some more.

I doubled the recipe and crumbled a pound of real bacon into the mixture. I also blanched the peppers for 5 minutes (should have gone about 8).The triple coating is a bit of a pain but the end result is probably worth the extra effort. I put half of the pepper seeds into the filling mix and dusted the poppers with cayenne before starting the breading process and the heat was still mild at best (I like hot stuff though). Good basic popper recipe that I will drastically spice up (even more) the next time I make it.

My favorite appetizer from SuperBowl Sunday...  Mmmm mmmm good!  My husband said they're better than a restaurant.  I refrigerated the milk/flour dredged poppers for 10 mins or so then went with the rest of the recipe (milk/bread crumbs dredging)  I used panko breadcrumbs.

Loved the recipe, i made  70 of them and froze em in. My batch of peppers was alot hotter than normal so i couldnt eat more than two at once(I had to stop myself from eating them, cause they were delicious). Most people that tried them and who werent lovers of spicy food couldnt eat em at all. I didnt listen to the warning of using rubber gloves and had to pay the price. I made them on a saterday and i couldnt sleep that night cause of the burning on my hands and face. The burning lasted till tuesday but luckely not as bad as the first day. Maybe its because we dutch people arent used to spicy food, but i went to hell that first night:p next time the rubber gloves are the first thing im gonna buy:)

This is an awesome recipe!  I know some people were unhappy with the amount of heat, but even taking membranes and seeds out, some jalapenos keep much of their heat.  Last year our jalapenos were extremely mild.  We were able to eat them straight off the plant!  This year they are hot and even stay hot after making them into poppers. They are still good after freezing and reheating in the oven. So glad to those who shared that info! I don't blanch them because I like the crunch of the pepper. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I followed the recipe to the T except I cooked fresh bacon, chopped it up once dried and I baked the poppers instead of frying them. Baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. They came out crunchy and awesome.

I made these poppers as the recipe recommended and found them to be very time consuming but tasty.  I used peppers from my garden, sharp cheddar and fresh fried bacon, the taste was amazing!  I expected the breading to be too thick and tasteless  based on the number of layers of flour and bread crumbs but it was very thin yet held the cream cheese mixture in perfectly. As recommended by other reviewers, I did par cook the peppers for 2-3 minutes in boiling water and allowed them to cool before stuffing them.

I followed the recipe but used real bacon instead of bacon bits and absolutely loved it, I made them for a party and they were the biggest hit, they kept disappearing the second they were out of the fryer : )my only note is that I would add more bacon to the mixture

These were not complicated to make. The breading was nice and thick and stuck well to the pepper. However, the other reviewers are correct in stating that the peppers should be par cooked to avoid crunchy peppers when deep frying. Also, the whole thing was lacking flavor. When I make these again, I will make sure to season the flour and breadcrumbs well. I will also quickly grill the pepper halves to give more flavor and season them with salt.

Fantastic recipe. I changed the recipe a little and put the jalapenos in boiling water for about 2-3mins (so the can soften a little). I used mild chedder cheese, kraft bacon bits, and whipped low fat cream cheese. I also used italian bread crums instead of the regular ones.I used double the amount of bacon bits the recipe said to use. My husband loved them. He gets jalapenos poppers at every restaurant we go too and he said they tasted better then any restaurant-I agreed.

I gave this recipe 4 stars for 2 reasons.  I made a small batch to test them out and the breading was fantastic.  I think the trick to good breading is the multiple coats and allowing them to rest in between.  I will use that tip on many other recipes in the future.  My first reason for not giving it a 5 is that the larger jalapenos did not soften while frying.  The second was that they were not spicy.  For my next round of test poppers I boiled the peppers for a few minutes and then let them cool after I seeded them.  Then, I added some chopped up jalapenos to the mix.  They were even better!  Thank you for the great recipe and hopefully my tips help!

Very yummy! I didn't have bacon bits so I sliced up a piece of ham and mixed it in and it was really good. Everything else I followed as written. I was very surprised they came out as crunchy as they were and didn't fall apart as other recipes I've tried. I gave them five stars!!!

Very good recipe and easy to prepare.  Excellent frozen, and cooked later.  Used Hormel Real Bacon Pieces instead of those artificial bacon bits.  Fried at 350 degrees in my deep fryer and they turned out great!

These are the best ever!!!  Great recipe, perfect ratio of cheese to Jalapeno's and spot on with the triple dipping (flour & bread crumbs).  For anyone who misses the heat of the Jalapeno's, save the seeds when you cut the Jalapeno's and add them (when you mix) into the cheeses & bacon.

These are AWESOME!!!
The breading doesn't stick the the backs (as you can pretty much see in the picture) But it doesn't affect the flavor.  VERY TASTY! 
the recipe calls for a couple extra steps than we took.
For instance, it says to dip in milk and in flour and let dry.  Then to repeat in the milk and then bread crumbs, and to repeat that.
We mixed the bread crumbs with the flour, and did a single dip in each.  They were fantastic, and not OVERLY breaded. (just perfect in my book)
Would totally recommend this recipe!

It takes a lot of time but the compliments and empty platter were worth it! They hold up very over night in fridge and reheated in oven. They stayed crisp and delicious! I've made them for 3 parties and they're a hit every time!

These weren't very good, they were bland and for some reason the jalapeno just tasted like a bell pepper. I boiled the peppers first for about 2 minutes but should have done 4 as they were still kinda hard after frying. I also left in all the seeds and used seasoned breadcrumbs. The breading came out great but alas I was left with a not spicy at all bell pepper with creme cheese. Edit* Tried this using whole pickled jalapeno's from a can and they came out great.They had a little spice and I didn't have to worry about boiling the japs to get them soft.

A good basic recipe to extend from. I used a mixture of cheeses instead of just cheddar. After halving and seeding the peppers, I boiled them for about 2-3 minutes and shocked them with cold water to stop the cooking, then cooled further before filling (as suggested by another user). Without this step, the peppers are a little too tough. If You don't have bread crumbs, you can use corn meal like I did myself. Not a perfect recipe, but it's easy to fix it to your taste.

These were fantastic. I will never make my poppers any other way. One piece of advice is that if you use larger peppers like I do, either blanche your peppers to break them down a bit or cook your peppers for 4 minutes versus the 2/3 minutes that the recipe calls for.

To up the heat and flavor, fry up Mexican chorizo to add instead of the bacon.  After cooking the chorizo till it's done (Mexican chorizo is a fine ground meat, not a cooked/smoked sausage like Spanish chorizo), just let it cool before you add it to the cream cheese.

These are delicious! They weren't as hot as I had hoped, so I did make a couple of changes. I blanched the jalapenos whole for two minutes, then seeded them once they were cool, they turned out hotter for me that way (the first time I seeded them and then blanched them). I used a 5 cheese blend, added extra bacon (not bacon bits), and used italian breadcrumbs, adding in some garlic powder and cayenne. These are a little time consuming, but so worth it! I thought they would be greasy being fried in oil, but they aren't. They also reheat in the oven wonderfully. Thank you for the amazing recipe! We can't stop eating them!

Fail.
Jalepenos- crunchy- cooked most of the way still good-ish. the flavor was gone but texture wise it was great.
cheese- absolutely delicious. that i could snack on for days! like with crackers at christmas time! but when it cooked it melted like milk and couldnt stay in the jalapenos very well at least the top portion and it stuck to the bottom of the pan.
crust-overall a basic cover and it was good but it was really doughy and cooked really fast. To cook it all the way you had to burn it and mine was on the right temperature even lower so I wouldn't burn it. I pretty much had to pick it off the whole meal because it just didnt work out well.
overall. I am from now on, going to always buy the freezer jalapeno poppers. they are crispier, have better lasting flavor, have just as much if not more heat (I even added the seeds to the cheese). It certainly makes a lot but its not going away fast enough. Im glad most of you had luck with this recipe but I am never making them again. 

P.S. WEAR THE DARN GLOVES! MY HANDS BURNED FOR HOURS AND IVE CUT JALAPENOS MANY MANY TIMES BEFORE AND NEVER HAD A PROBLEM. IT WASN'T A NORMAL STING. MY HANDS WERE ON FIRE ALL FREAKING NIGHT LONG.

Really good!  I grow my own jalapenos and they were great!  It's true that they need a little heat, but that's easy to fix.  I even used some yellow wax peppers and they were equally good!

I really enjoyed them--thanks! I did add some onion powder, paprika powder and some dried cilantro and triple coated them with bread crumbs and blanched them for 3 minutes before preparing, but they were just the right amount of spice for me--if stuff is too hot, you can't taste anything! I also used light cream cheese to keep the calories down! Only thing I would add is some pre-cooked spinach, but it's matter of taste as always! :-)

These are great. Make sure you wear gloves to cut up peppers. I used Italian bread crumbs and three times as much bacon bits and the saltiness was just right. Make sure you use three coatings or the cheese will leak through. I don't like heat, so I cleaned the seads and ribs out totally. The taste was just right. Coating was much crisper than the traditional flour-egg-crumb sequence. Drying in between really helps seal everything in. It takes some time, but I cleaned and blanched one day and stuffed and fried the next. Makes it seem easier. I'll make these again for sure.

WOW these were amazing! I made them on a whim after finding fresh jalapenos at the farmers market. I have to admit, I never fully read recipe instructions and my hands have been burning for 24 hours. I really thought I could handle it. The spicy part of peppers is not the seeds but the white membrane inside, so I chopped up some of that to put in the cheese mixture as well. I skipped the flour step but the bread crumbs still stuck (they were fine ground), I added a little bit of cumin for taste and I also used skim milk. I sprayed them well with cooking spray before putting them in the oven for 20 min at 350 degrees. Served with ranch dressing to dip them in, they were SO GOOD I will definitely make these again!

Best ever these are not. This is the  most disappointed I've ever been with a recipe from this site. The basic recipe is a good foundation for a popper, but these need more seasoning. I thought the bacon and cheese would lend enough salt to this recipe, but that was not the case. There really needs to be some salt, pepper, and garlic powder somewhere in this recipe. If you want heat, you HAVE TO keep some of the membrane and seeds in. Otherwise, it'll be like eating a stuffed green pepper. Look at some of the reviews, add some of the adjustments that other people have made (the tip about blanching is a good one!) but don't make this recipe as written.

Great recipe! These were VERY well received. A bit time consuming, but not difficult at all. Read some of the other reviews so I did a thorough job with the seed and veins, but added back a little heat/flavor with Tiger Sauce in the cheese mixture. Also finished each with a quick pinch of kosher salt when it came out of the oil. That little bit of seasoning made all the difference. So good!

On point with the triple-dip/drying technique; however, couple of suggested changes to combat the blandness (see other reviews). First, I agree with the other reviewer regarding salting immediately after frying. The before/after with this is night and day. I dusted with cayenne pepper as well to bring back the heat. Definitely keep the membrane in. Great technique, recipe items could be tweaked, but anyone could come up with 150 variations, so....

I just made these for the first time today. They came out really good. I was doing other things while making them and I inadvertently forgot to coat them with breadcrumbs a second time, so the crunchy coating was thin, but it was still tasty and crunchy. Prior to trying this recipe, I read RAYKATS' review about the jalapeños losing some spiciness when you seed them, so to avoid that, I saved the insides (some of the pepper + the seeds) after seeding, threw them into my food processor to chop them up a bit, and added it to the cream cheese, which made it spicy and really tasty.  I did as Jessica C. mentioned in her review, to bake them in the oven instead of frying them because I'm trying to eat healthier.  She didn't mention how long she baked them for except that the oven was set to 350º and she took them out when the cheese was bubbling, so I did that (it took about 40 minutes).  A couple of other changes I made were I only used about half of the 8 oz package of shredded cheddar -- it seemed like it would be super cheesy with the whole bag -- and, instead of using bacon bits, I cooked a couple of strips of turkey bacon and broke those up.  They came out great and my boyfriend liked them.

This is a really good recipe you wont be dissapointed. I did follow the recipe the 1st time. it was bland so I made some changes. The 2nd time I grated half of a sweet onion, 1 garlic clove grated, salt and pepper, chedder cheese and chili powder and the zest of 1 lime.
I also filled them with the cheese mix then I put them in the fridge over night then I breaded them 2x milk, flour,milk bread crumb, milk,flour, milk bread crumb. I did bake them. I did leave the bacon out.

This is *time-consuming!*  

I swore I'd never make them again... until I tasted them!  It's exactly like ordering them from a restaurant.  Sooo delicious!  Get your friends, spouse, kids, whoever to help you.  Make an assembly line and go to town!!  

Then freeze most of them just before the frying step (whatever you don't want to eat immediately).  You can fry them fresh later, directly out of the freezer, no thawing.  They will tell you when they're done by floating to the surface.  

I made some with just cream cheese and some with cheese and cream cheese.  I skipped the bacon.  Both versions are great.  Don't forget to salt them before serving!  They are fairly bland without it.

These turned out pretty well. Although my husband and I felt that they were a little bland. Next time I think we might try adding some seasoning to the bread crumbs, and maybe a little bit of spice to the cheese mixture. Otherwise they were great. The breading process is a little time consuming but well worth it. I think this recipe is a good start but could but could use a little something extra.

We LOVE this recipe.  I make it far too much on wintery weekends.  I do add some of the seeds back for more flavor but leave the rest just as it is.  Thanks for posting

as a base the recipe works very well after reading the other comments i decided to take about 20% of the seeds and add them back into the cheese mix I also added 2/3 of a can of diced tomatoes (strained and shaken to take a lot of mosture out) as well as 1 small yellow onion diced (very fine) Added the heat back in and gave a little more color to the popper Will be making this again and probably playing with the mix even more

Ok, but bland. I made as directed but baked (400 degrees for about 20 minutes) instead of frying. A lot of work, that's for sure. If I make these again, I will use some pepper jack cheese as has been suggested and maybe use something in the bread crumbs as well.

I love this recipe. However, i made several small changes due to taste preferences. I blanched the peppers (in water, not the traditional oil) for about ten minutes after reading a great review with this tip. next time I might blanch them a little bit longer. I left out the bacon (I don't care for it) and used mozzarella instead of cheddar. Both might be quite nice. I also used italian bread crumbs. Instead of cutting the peppers in half (which makes deep frying quite difficult) i cut the tops off and used a potato peeler to dig out the seeds. This also retains just a little bit of the heat, but it's not overpowering (I'm a wimp when it comes to hot food!) using a pastry bag or even a ziplock bag with the corner cut works perfect for piping the cheese into the peppers this way.

Excellent recipe, very easy to make.  Time consuming, but well worth it!  Put on some music and make tasty treats!  I didn't deep fry, so I had to flip the poppers over, and yes, the filling oozes out, but it's not that bad.  I did not use bacon, just the cream cheese and cheddar, and they came out wonderfully.

My first time out, I made these just as the recipe suggests except without the bacon.  Through the process, I was frustrated and convinced I wouldn't make them again.  Seemed like far too much work for an appetizer.  But then we tasted them.  They are great, and I have never before liked poppers; I was only making them for my husband because we had a bumper crop of jalapenos in our garden.  The one change we both agreed on was that the cheese could use a little more flavor to hold up against the heat of the peppers; our peppers are pretty hot.  We're going to try a sharp cheddar next time.  Otherwise, I'll be making these again in large batches.  I think they'll be great for parties, etc.

These were fabulous!  The actual preparation wasn't as bad as I thought it would be; I just lined everything up on my kitchen table - kind of like an assembly line!    I used 20 jalapenos of all different sizes and there was JUST the right amount of filling for all of them.  I didn't skimp on the filling either; they were all pretty packed!  Once the peppers were breaded, I put them in the freezer until "showtime".  They looked awesome uncooked!  The poppers fried up nicely and were definitely yummy!  Next time, I am going to use more bacon.    I had frozen leftovers that didn't make it to the fryer, so they went back into the freezer.  The next day, I didn't want to turn the fryer on again, so I just popped them in the oven for about 14-15 minutes at 425.  They weren't quite as good as the fried version, but they were still tasty!

the coating was awesome!  I ended up using panko, toasted bread crumbs, and smashed up Triscuits - what ever I had.  I used jalapenos with some seeds from my garden, they were the hottest peppers ever!  We were pouring sweat and loving them.  Know how hot your peppers are, it will make a difference!!!

These were the 1st poppers I ever made.. I don't have a deep fryer so I simply filled my big cast iron skillet with half veg. oil and half evoo.   These poppers had the most perfect coating ever! They were golden brown and crispy and perfect. However, I listened to a few other's reviews and added the seeds to my filling. THEY WERE TOO HOT TO EAT! I really love spicy food and I thought I could handle about anything. However, we ended up spooning out the insides and throwing out the peppers.  Next time I will omit the seeds and maybe blanch the peppers first.

I just made 7 dozen of these bad boys.... they are really time consuming.... but well worth it.... I did mine in a deep frier though and they turned out great to me that is the way to do them.... they good evenly and quickly great recipe... just make sure you have time to make them.... o and wear gloves while handling peppers (I didn't and my fingers are on fire!!)... they also freeze well and can be reheated at 425 for 15 minutes...

Wow - these are great.  I loved them!  We used to serve jalapeno poppers at a restaurant where I used to work in Wisconsin, and we always served them with shrimp sauce for dipping them into.  These are not difficult to make.  In between coatings, I just did other stuff around the house, and then got back to it when I got back to it.  It really didn't seem "time consuming" to me, like other reviewers have complained about.  I can't wait to make these for an appetizer when we have dinner guests.  I'm sure they will be a big hit!  Thanks for the recipe.

5 star flavor but the whole process was such a pain!!  Seriously guys, you're better off buying frozen. No mess and you'll save yourself a few hours in the kitchen. It is afterall, only a snack.

This recipe was not bad overall.  I prefer the regular cream cheese stuffed poppers to this though.  I should have taken others suggestions to blanch the peppers first and to use real bacon rather than bacon bits, as I think both of these things would have helped.  I also think a full fat cream cheese would have been best to use, I used a low fat and it was lacking in flavor.  Changes I made were: added a little season salt to the cheese mix, used only Italian bread crumbs and no flour to coat, and added an egg to the milk for coating.  The best part of making this recipe for me was that I learned that double dipping/breading the poppers definitely lends to a great fried coating!  My bf commented that these looked like restaurant quality after they came out of the frier.  Also, they were not too greasy at all.  I think with a few changes as suggested by other reviewers, this could be even better!

Fantastic poppers!  Made 24 using jalapenos from our garden.  They were devoured in minutes flat!!  Easy to make - my 18 year old made them himself.  A little time consuming but oh-so-worth the effort!!  Cooked them for two minutes in the deep fryer.  Three minutes would have burned them. Thanks for an amazing recipe, HLSANDS!

I tried to bake them... but peeking in the oven a few minutes in I realized, NO, I'VE GOTTA HAVE THEM FRIED IN FAT. They just would not be the same. So I did and they were delicious. I agree with another reviewer that they were a little on the bland side. I think garlic powder or garlic salt mixed into the cream cheese would do the trick. One more thing, I did blanch my peppers first and for me they were just PERFECTLY spicy. But my husband requires more. He said fill it with jalapeno cheese. hah. I might try that with half of them next time :) Thanks for this recipe! I was so proud to serve these to my husband who adores jalapenos.

These were simply amazing!  I picked the peppers from my garden yesterday and followed the recipe exactly except that I blanched the peppers for 2 minutes before I stuffed them.  I put the two sides back together to make the pepper whole again before I breaded them.  I was afraid that they'd come apart during frying but they turned out just beautiful and they were so tastey dipped in horseradish sauce.

Super good! I added 2x the bacon and also added some canned jalapenos diced so that it was spicy. Also added a pinch of cayenne pepper to the cheese mix. We loved them...although I wish they were quicker to make...took a super long time and I was bored by the end of it all. Add real bacon and not bacon bits otherwise you will not really taste it.

The name of this recipe says it all... I just made these and they are really the best ever!!! Followed the recipe exactly, except I added a TBSP of chopped chives from my herb garden to the filling and blanched the peppers slightly before stuffing.  It is well worth all the work!! This is a keeper! Thanks

My son loves jalapeno peppers so much we planted some in our back yard.  So we tried this recipe tonight and absolutely loved it.  Wouldn't change a thing. Definitely would make again.

I got hooked on fast food (which will remain nameless but their initials are JITB) Jalepeno Poppers and decided to try this recipe.  Oh My God - this is way better than theirs.  I did it exactly per the recipe except I blanched mine and used low fat cheese   Just awesome!

These were kind of difficult to make (and kept falling apart on me) but they were very tasty.  (I always omit bacon bits.) Served with a homemade "arby's" bronco berry sauce.

Boiling the peppers for about 4 min before stuffing them really helped the texture.

This was excellent, I think it is important to let the jalapeno sit after you did the initial coating, this will help the coating to stick when fried. For the filling, 12 oz of cream cheese was way too much, I used 8 oz and still had plenty left over.  Some mentioned it being bland, I seasoned the mixture with more bacon, onion and garlic powder, and garlic salt.  My hubby requested these for football snacks.

The best we've tried yet. Frying at 365 degrees makes a big difference:keeps the stuffing in and tames the firey heat of the jalapenos.

Takes a good while to make, but well worth it in the end. My first time making jalapeño poppers and they taste great! Like others have said, Blanch the peppers in nearly-boiling water and let them cool down before stuffing, or else the peppers will be a bit crispy. What I did with my stuffing is use all the ingredients stated EXCEPT I didn't have bacon bits...and I substituted the cheddar cheese with just hand-chopped up Kraft American cheese slices because I don't like cheddar. You'll only need about 4 of those if you're making the whole recipe. I used only two slices because I was only making half. I also added my own personal seasonings like dried oregano, paprika powder, pepper, garlic powder, a little bit of chopped onions, but this isn't necessary, as I'm a flavor-freak I wanted to do it to mine. Also if you want your poppers to have a bit of extra spiciness like I did(as the poppers themselves really aren't spicy at all) then I suggest you chop up ONE habanero pepper (use gloves! Habaneros are probably 10x hotter than Jalapeños if not more) very finely and and add to the cream cheese mixture, this made my poppers just as spicy as I wanted them. I know it may be a little more work than you want to do, but please do follow the instructions precisely when it comes to the coating, 1ce in the flour and 2x in the bread crumbs, I did this and the coating of these poppers came out amazingly well, well worth the little extra time.

These were UNBELIEVABLE! As others suggested, I blanched the peppers for 2 minutes. I used pepperjack cheese to increase the heat and it was PERFECT! Time consuming, but we froze about 40 of them. AWESOME!

My mistake to think that jalapenos from the local Mexican market could be a cheaper substitute for the blander normal market ones. Fortunately the sauce is tasty and leave a hint of spiciness behind.. once I peel the chilie off.

These came out better than the ones I buy in the store! We grow our own jalaoenos, so they are fresh and have a nice kick, but I added a little cayenne pepper to make sure.  I also prefer more cheddar cheese, so I added 8 oz and they were fantastic!

These are excellent! Not spicy, but tasty enough for all ages. Hearing other reviewers complain it was "bland", I crumbled sharp cheddar instead of mild, added in some turkey bacon, and chopped some fresh cilantro for the filling. The double breading is a must, and I used italian bread crumbs with a little extra herbs and spices for a kick. They were a favorite at the bbq, and now everyone wants the recipe. Yum Yum Yum~

These went over very well. They were a lot of work, I thought, so I tripled the recipe and froze the rest uncooked. Then I defrosted them in the fridge overnight and they turned out the same.

Gotta love these! Yes, they are a bit of work but they do freeze well and reheat in the oven well. Next time I will make a large quantity so I dont have to make the mess so often. Another suggested using jalapeno cheese, great suggestion will do the same.

Awesome flavor, but used fresh jalapeno's from my garden, and they were not cooked through after frying.  Next time I'll used the jarred.

I am so sad these weren't as great as everyone said they were. I bought enough ingredients to make the whole recipe, but only made half this first time. I'm glad I did. I will definately follow some of the advice listed in the reviews second time around. Even though it looked like a was over stuffing the peppers, they came out with little filling in the end. They weren't very spicy at all (to me, my BF was sniffling a little) so I will leave in a few of the seeds next tine. I will season the flour also, maybe with some seasoned salt. I used PANKO bread crumbs and they were so crunchy. I'm not sure what they're like with regular, but I enjoyed the breading this way. I will maybe use half seasoned, half panko next time. Also, I tripled what they recommended for the bacon, and I still didn't taste, so I may use real bacon instead of 'real bacon bits'. All in all, very time consuming as stated many times over, and bland. Good Luck!!!

I expected to be absolutely wowed by these, and they were okay.  The jalapenos were still too crunchy after frying - next time I will blanche for 1-2 minutes first as others suggested.  I did add garlic powder to the flour that I dredged them in.  They were crunchy, and I did not have any major filling leaks, but the flavor needs something else.  Next time I think I'll leave out the bacon bits, add back some of the seeds, and maybe add a dash or two of taco seasoning or chili powder to the cheese mixture.

I have really enjoyed these, but I did change the recipe a little.  I added one can of chopped green chiles to the chees mixture, and used about half plain bread crumbs and half of the italian bread crumbs, otherwise there just wasn't enough flavor.  I also baked these, otherwise it seemed like most of the cheese came out in the frying process.  Huge hit!

I have made these many times - always a hit!!! Even with family members who don't think they like jalapenos.  Personally, I like the little bit of snap to the jalapeno, so the cooking time is perfect.  Wish the coating part wasn't so time consuming.  Definetely worth the work!

These were a huge hit! Based on a combination of other reviews, I used buttermilk instead of milk and used panko breadcrumbs instead of regular. I also blanched the peppers for several minutes to soften them up. Time consuming, but worth the effort!

Mmmm, they are great but what a MESS to make.  Time consuming too.  My back hurt by the end of the process... I also added mozzarella to the mix and some mayo.  I seasoned my flour with some cayenne and garlic powder and nonsalt seasoning, and mixed an egg in with the milk.  Finally, I used Italian bread crumbs.  They were awesome.  Very addicting, but thankfully, due to the pain in the rump these were (literally), I won't have to worry about eating these too often.  Worth a try if you have the time and patience and an abundance of peppers to use up!  :)

Truely wonderful. I used panko (Asian bread crumbs) instead of normal bread crumbs, which made the recipe even better.

I followed this recipe exactly and was very pleased with the results- but not crazy about the amount of work that went into them. We still have leftovers, and the deep frying was a scary process- not to mention that these are nutritionally REALLY not very good for us. Perhaps we simply had too much food that night, but I don't think I'll spend the time on them again. Be careful to only use breadcrumbs that are plain- half my batch was rolled in italian seasoned breadcrumbs and they were not nearly as good!

Wow! These little dolls are sooo good! I made a double batch, freezing most of them. Both fried up very well with NO leakage. I had only half and half to use for the milk and used Wondra for sauces and gravy for the flour.I ran out of crumbs near the end and only rolled some of them in crumbs one time, still NO leakage. I love the flavor of half cream and half cheddar cheese and the bacon adds a nice twist. These are not like the soggy faded green poppers you find in the deli case, they are vibrant and taste really fresh because they are made with fresh peppers. Highly suggest you try these if you love poppers like I do. They are the best I ever tasted!

Holy jalepeno poppers! These were time consuming but definately the best I've ever had! I too used half chedder & half pepper jack cheeses and I also used egg instead of milk so the bread crumbs would stick better and they tasted great. Everyone I made them for loves them & has asked me to make more. Thank you for making mine & my friends mouths POP!

Incredibly goooooooood!!!  Only thing I would change is to use pepper jack cheese and add some cayenne next time.  I have learned that 'triple-dipping' is the ONLY way to deep fry.  I also put them in the frig between 2nd and 3rd dipping and then again after the 3rd dipping.  They were absolutely the 'best ever' I have ever made!  (and I've made quite a few.)  LOL  Thanks Heather!!!

Very good stuff!  I would not put in any bacon bits.  I found you need about 46 jalapeno halves for this much cheese.  Also you'll need a little more breadcrumbs than mentioned, I found 5 toasted and grated slices does ~30 jalapeno halves.  Make a lot and freeze the rest!  Goes nicely with the Guacamole recipe on this site by Bob Cody.

These are just wonderful!  The jalapenos are still slightly crispy and even have a very slight sweet taste.  I love that, much better than the over processed jalapenos you get in the commercial variety.  I did skip the bacon (never been a fan of that in poppers), and used a lovely mix of strawberry jam (raspberry would be good too) and cayenne pepper to dip them in.  I also added more cheddar in relation to the cream cheese.  No leakage AT ALL......even made a "soy cheese" version for my lactose intolerant roommate.  The breading was just incredible......can see me using that for various things!

YEEEEHHAAAWWW!!! These are the best!  They are so easy and so good.  I had to cook them a little longer to get my bacon brown, but other than that I am taking them to every event from now on!  Guests will be happier than pigs in doo with these tasty treats!

This is a great recipe.  Considering how much you pay for just 6-8 when you dine out or buy them in the frozen at the supermarket, it is worth the work.  I have made over three dozen and they freeze well.  I had no problem making them or frying them at all.  I look forward to holidays and parties when I can share them with family and friends, no one will believe I made them :)

I wish the recipe had clarified to use fresh jalapenos. I didn't! Didn't taste as good with the pickled ones. I paired this with the Pico de Gallo Chicken Quesadillas so I was working with that as I made the poppers. The breading process worked best for me when I dipped all the jalapenos in the milk at once, drained using a strainer and reserving the milk, and then shook a few at a time in a ziplock baggie. I then breaded half of them and fried them while I breaded the other half. They were really good, and I can't wait to try them again with the fresh jalapenos I bought today. I wonder, too, how they freeze and what the process would be for freezing and reheating them. Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I would recommend making up a large batch for efficiency and freezing/refrigerating the extras for later as these reheat well in the oven. Also, you can use Monterrey Jack or Pepper Jack cheese to cut down on the sodium for people with dietary concerns.

Made them for my husband, he loved them said they were the best he had ever had.  I used pepper jack cheese, just a slice and wrapped the cream cheese around it and stuffed it. Then followed the directions.

Originally I made these EXACTLY as instructed. They were tasty but in need of a little "bump". I did them again & used seasoned panko in place of the plain breadcrumbs, mixed 3 parts sharp cheddar with 1 part "spicy" cheese in place of the regular cheddar, and increased the amount of bacon. They came out FANTASTIC! Just enough spice to remind u it's a "jalapeno".. lol

This was fantastic! I used plain publix cream cheese, Wyke smoked cheddar, and Cabot pepper jack cheese. Just mix until you get the flavor profile you want. Used bread crumbs, salt, pepper, and Szechuan pepper for the breading mix. I’m going to add habanero flakes to a few next time for even more kick. Very good recipe, experiment with the filling and breading to make it yours.

Giving 5 stars even though I swapped out the bacon for green scallions.  I par-boiled the peppers to aid in softening. When ppl say wear gloves...please wear gloves. My poor fingers are still burning hours later.  But, my goodness, these things are awesome.  Due to diet issues, I also used gluten free seasoned bread crumbs. After the 3rd drudge in milk and second crumb coating, it was next to impossible to know  what side was cheese. I used my air fryer at 395 degrees 5 minutes one side and 4 minutes on second. Perfect! These will be made again for sure. Makes enough to freeze and reheat what you want for later, or for a group/party.

I made these poppers for Kentucky Derby party and they were a big hit. However, I modified a few things and learned a few things and want to share with you. (1) Equal parts Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Pepper Jack, and cream cheese. (2) Cooked 1 lb. of bacon, diced and added to cheese mixture for 50 poppers. (3) Mound cheese above pepper... lots of cheese. (4) Although I coated three times with milk-dry ingredient bath, the dry ingredient was different each time... (1st) milk and all purpose flour (2nd) milk and Panko bread crumbs (3rd) I use this coating for my fried green tomatoes... milk and dry: 2 parts dry, finely grated parmesan cheese and 1 part corn meal. Make sure each coating is dry before adding next coating. I deep fried four-at-a- time in approx. 4 inches of hot Canola Oil for approx. 3 - 4 minutes max. and turned them in the oil constantly. They were delicious!!!! And by the way, believe it or not, they paired perfectly with the Mint Julips (which were delicious too!!!). The worst part of the day: my horse didn't win.

I have made these numerous times and they are fantastic. I use WAY more bacon (a whole bag). 

They freeze very well also. Made a huge batch and froze after frying. Just pop in the oven to heat and they are just as crispy as when they were originally made.

We followed the recipe to the T . Looked exactly like the photo and I was  excited to try it But when I dug in, the filing was so bland. I was very disappointed with this recipe. I guess I'll have to invent my own filling and pass it off as my great grand mothers recipe lol.

This really is an all star recipe. I didn't follow exactly as I always make with the tastes of my family in mind. 
1st -  used a slender steak knife to cut off end and take out the veins and seeds. This was easy step. I used baggy to cover hand and used running water to keep the burn out of my eyes. I then broiled and put in baggies to get the skins off. Peeling them off the small pepper was by far the most time consuming thing to do.
2nd - I mixed crushed bacon, lots of cheddar and I used a chive and onion cream cheese. 
3rd - I used a thick baggy to mix the cream cheese, bacon, and cheddar and then cut the end off to pipe into the peppers.
4th - I rolled the stuffed peppers in flour. Then dipped in whipped eggs and milk, then rolled in the Panko and flour mixture. I did put them all in the fridge for a half an hour and then rolled them in the mixture again to get the cracks filled. 
My oil was so hot it literally took 30 seconds to deep fry them and melt the cheese inside.
Really only thing I did differently was core and de-seed peppers first and use a flavor of cream cheese that I felt would enhance the flavor. It really did!  I may add some finely chopped pickled jalapeno peppers to the cream cheese mix next time!
Thanks for the stellar recipe!

I use real bacon and chop it up. I also use a 3 cheese mexican blend. I blanch the peppers for about 2 -3 minutes depending on how big they are. We like our poppers not too crunchy. I take the seeds and blend it with the cheese mixture to give it more kick. I freeze them before the dipping process so they don't fall apart on me. It's labor intensive but well worth it.

I thought these were really good. I used jalapeño pepperoni instead of bacon because I didn't have any.  As far as the reviews saying it is too bland, that is not the fault of the recipe. You can add spice by hanging on to some or all of the seeds and mixing it in with the cheese mixture. you can spice it up so many ways - I added cayenne to the flour, kept half of the seeds and I felt it was warm enough.  My husband can eat habaneros like they are candy and he said they were fantastic but he would have liked them a little hotter, but he always wants EVERYTHING hotter!

I made these poppers for a housewarming/potluck, they were delicious! I did make minor changes to the recipe. I doubled the recipe and decided to use half sharp cheddar cheese and half monterey jack. I blanched the peppers in boiling water as others suggested. I also made my own bacon bits as I feel they are more delicious. I like my poppers to be spicy so I added some of the seeds into the cheese mix. I have a deep fryer which I set at 355°F Fried 6-8 at a time for about 1-2 minutes and they were done!

We had always attempted these but could never get the breading to stick. The drying between coating must be the trick.  These are fantastic. We fry them, freeze them then reheat at 425 for 15 minutes when we want a snack.  We also used the same recipe for habanero peppers. Loved those as well.

Love these! Made as directed but will blanch peppers in the future for easier eating. No other improvements recommended. Experiment with cheeses; pepper jack was fabulous!

My neighbors and I love this recipe! I do an even mix of cream cheese and cheddar cheese. Then about about 12oz of bacon to 14-16 oz of total cheese. Deep fry, freeze, then bake at 350-375 for 15 min.

These are the best jalapeno poppers I've ever had by far. Be warned, the prep time for this is much longer than the 45 mins listed - by the time you cut and de-seed all the peppers it had already taken more than 30 mins. I swapped out cheddar cheese for monterray jack (you won't regret it).

I used the exact amounts specified and I had PLENTY of cheese filling left over (even after stuffing the peppers as full as I could).

Before making these I read the reviews and many said they weren't spicy so I added the seeds from my biggest pepper into the cheese mix - The spiciness was perfect! Just be careful how many seeds you use as they can easily be over compensated. 

Some of the breading was falling off by the time they finished cooking but I don't think my oil was hot enough.

Great as written. Made a second batch with half blue cheese as well. You can easily tweek these for your preference. Used panko bread crumbs and only breaded once (I did try double breading on some - it didn't seem necessary and made batter too thick for my taste). Followed all the drying times and put finished poppers into fridge until ready to fry. Had zero issues. Thanks for sharing!

Made these for a get-together and everyone loved them. Granted, they took time. I threw them in the freezer after each coating (flour, breadcrumbs, breadcrumbs) to harden. I ran out of breadcrumbs it took so many, so be prepared with lots on hand. Also, I omitted the bacon bits. I did try baking these and did not like the texture - luckily I only baked 2 to see how they would taste. The rest we fried and they were incredible.

Heather, I have been using your recipe for these poppers since 2002, and I've made thousands of them, in fact, I am making a batch of 70 poppers today.  People have stated growing jalapenos in their gardens and bringing them to me to make these poppers for them. Some even buy the cream cheese & bacon too...  lol, and I didn't even ask them to do this...  too funny!  My husband loves them too!  And you are right when you said that they don't last long... I think I've probably enjoyed maybe only 8 of these poppers myself out of the thousands I've made, but personally I get more satisfaction from seeing everyone else enjoying them.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is without a doubt one of the best jalapeno popper I have ever had. The textures of the pepper and cheese is perfect. The coating holds together very well with that crispy crunchy perfection that blends the ingredients into just enough heat, creamy perfection and crunch. Real winner. My thanks to the creator:)

I personally  liked these peppers. My boyfriend on the other hand was not too thrilled; but it's a pretty decent recipe... Not a big hit like I expected them to be though.

I made some changes:

Used pepper jack instead of cheddar for an extra kick (highly recommend it).

I also swapped the bacon bits for real bacon because it was what I had at home, next time I make them I will probably use real bacon too.

Another user suggested blanching them to make the peppers a bit softer but I baked them instead so I managed to get a really pleasant texture.

Before baking them I sprinkled salt, pepper and garlic powder.

Update: I made them again, this time I wrapped them with bacon. A crowd pleaser!

Spot-on PERFECT!!  I followed the recipe exactly and covered them well with bread crumbs.  Patience is a virtue with theses babies!!  I froze them before deep frying as someone else suggested.  4 minutes in the deep fryer and they are totally awesome!!  We dipped them in jalepeno raspberry sauce and had sour cream available for the more cautious!!

Made these tonight and it was a little time consuming but well worth the effort. My wife liked them and that's saying something. Definitely a keeper recipe for me. I will put just a pinch of salt on my peppers before stuffing them next time. Thanks for the recipe!

Not very happy with the end result.  I read over many of the other comments and tried to do all the good steps I needed to do, like using pepperjack cheese and adding garlic powder, salt and pepper to flour and watching the temperature. I even did all the 10mins waiting between all the breadings.  I must say they looked great before and after cooking.  However, I lost so much cheese out of so many of them I wasn't happy.  I even tried not getting them too hot.  It all sounds good but to much work to see the cheese ease out of most.  I first tried the frying on the 1st batch and wasn't happy so I then baked, same result.  Sorry.  If the cheese stayed in, I'd be much happier.  As a side note, I've tried a couple of other jalapeno popper recipes on this site and they worked well with out this much work.   
UPDATE:  I had some left over and put in freezer, deep fried a few days later, much much better, No running cheese.  This is the way to do it!

I want to give this recipe 5 stars! These came out AMAZING. But I don't like hard/crunchy jalapenos for poppers so I put them in boiling water for about 3 minutes. I'm giving this recipe 4 stars because the softening process should really be in the directions. Coated them twice and they came out perfect. 

I made these for my boyfriend's work potluck and everyone loved them. I do recommend making more and freezing them- they are that good. But! Don't freeze them after you have already fried them. Freeze after coating for the best results!

This is a GREAT starter recipe. I say starter for you do need to add spices based on your on taste. First let me say that the cream cheese mixture is way more than you need for the amount of peppers it calls for. However you do need more milk, flour and bread crumbs than it calls for. Every ones taste is different so keep that in mind when making them.  I made 230 of them yesterday but this is how I spiced it up. I used half sharp cheddar and half pepper jack cheese. To my flour mixture I added cayenne pepper, garlic and onion powder, plus black pepper. I used fresh peppers out my own garden, but due to de-seeding them they where not hot. I used Progresso garlic and herb bread crumbs and even added some more cayenne pepper to it. I made just 6 all the way and fried them so I would know if I need to add anything else to the mixture before I made all 230. By doing so I knew to add more cayenne pepper for we like very hot foods. Do follow the direction and do the 3 dip coating. I placed them in freezer bag and froze them. I pulled some out from the freezer later and fried them. They did great from freezer to frying pan, do keep in mind that due to being frozen you need to cook them a little bit longer and not so fast (to high). It does take a while do make them due to the de-seeding and 3 time dipping, but well worth it. I will make them many time in the future.  0(*@*)0

I have a batch of these in the oven as we speak. I blanched my peppers for two minutes before to make them more tender. I used a little catfish breading mixed with the bread crumbs (cause I had it on hand.)And somje crushed ranch flavored crackers.   My cheese was shredded white cheddar seasoned with dried onion, chile powder,garlic powder and black pepper. My peppers are fresh from my garden.You should smell it. OMG! I did the triple breading and it looks like I got great coverage.  I can't wait to taste.  I have a NUWave oven and I'm baking on high for 20 minutes.  I may have to add time.  We'll see.  they smell good enough no matter how they taste.  Mmmm. Eating them now.  So Yummy.

Well I boiled about 2 lbs of fresh out of the garden top cut/de-seeded jalapenos for 10 min. Sure cleans out the sinuses/chest LOL. Used 12oz of cream cheese and 6oz of Colby/mont. jack with 2 caps of bacon. Dipped in milk, flour then with bread  crumbs that got a little darker than I wanted(was on the lap top) but they really turned out nice!

Wow they came out so crispy and restaurant quality! The dust bath I made wee bland as the recipe doesn't call for any salt or seasoning. I kicked the filling up with same cayenne pepper, paparika and salt. I used Italian bread crumbs that I also seasoned with oregano.

Only change, I replaced the cheddar cheese in the filling with Smoked Gouda cheese. Yumm... 
I'm not sure why the cheese oozed out of some of the poppers while frying though.
This recipe is awesome.

I made these for my husband and son tonight and they loved them. The triple coating and letting them set made all the difference from other recipes I've tried. I used cheddar and monterey jack cheeses because that's what I had on hand. I also cooked the bacon and made my own bits. They looked perfect and tasted great.

The best popper recipe I've found so far! Crunchy on the outside and gooey on the inside! The bacon is a must and I suggest salting them when they're fresh out! Yummy!!

These turned out very good.  I had so many jalapenos in my garden last summer, I didn't know what to do with them all.  I made this recipe, and froze them all on a cookie sheet, then stored them in freezer bags.  I take them out and fry them up whenever we want a few.  I serve them with homemade raspberry jam for dipping.

Incredible breading method.using just flour first and resting insures that the bread crumbs will adhere for a solid crispy shell.I've used this for poppers but more often to make perfect restaurant quality mozzarella cheese sticks.thanks for posting.

These are crazy good.  Make first time for super bowl party and they vanished!  They looked so professional but tasted better than anything you can buy.  I more like tripled the bacon and cooked fresh and crumbled.  I can't believe it!  I make them every chance I get!

Made this recipe for Super Bowl this weekend. Delicious and a huge hit! I used real bacon (since I was frying some anyway for another recipe) and would probably use more next time. The peppers were very crunchy, almost raw, even after frying them, so next time I will blanche them for a few minutes to soften them. The jalepeno's were huge so we cut some in half and left some whole. Make sure to put a lot of filling so they are nice and creamy. This is a fun recipe to make and SO much better than the frozen poppers from the grocery store.

Took an incredible amount of time to make.  I doubled the recipient and stuffed 36 peppers.  Pro: the multiple dredging and breadcrumb steps ensured the entire pepper WAS covered... Worked perfectly!    Con : long prep and only  pretty good in terms of taste...and sorely lacked in terms of heat.  I parboiled peppers for 4 minutes.  Doubled bacon, added garlic powder, chili powder, cayenne pepper, black pepper and onion powder to flour and breadcrumbs.  Added a little less than a tsp of seeds to cheese mix.  Finally, added a few shakes of Tabasco sauce to milk.    Still not enough flavor / heat.  I've only sampled 2 so far....and I'm hoping I got the 2 weak ones of the bunch,... Will taste more this w/ e.   so... They are ok... But certainly not great...at least as baked.  I was hoping not to fry... But now reconsidering.  Next time.... Probably will be one....  Ill add more Tabasco to milk and definatly add at least 1.5 tsp of seeds to the double cheese batter.  On the positive side, these are mild enough to share with a mixed crowd.  1 st time making poppers.... And thankful for the starting place ...will tweak to taste.

I tweaked things a bit and was very happy.  I did the cream cheese (only 8 oz) but added cheddar and some salsa con queso I had (Mission brand, medium), but I didn't put in bacon, only because I didn't have any bacon on hand.  I also added a couple tablespoons of cornstarch to the flour, and only dipped twice in the milk/flour before dipping one final time in milk and then into panko.  Then I tossed them into the microwave for 2 minutes 30 seconds before oven at 375 for 20 then 425 for another 10 or so.  The family loved them, and even though it was a small batch they are gone.  I wasn't super careful about removing ALL the seeds and membranes, we love hot Hot HOT and I was pleasantly surprised.  I'd make these again.

Great recipe! I've had rave reviews from all, these are my new favorite appetizer to make, a little time consuming but worth it. Tried the recipe both with the jalapeno seeds and without. You only need just a few seeds for a big hot kick. I also took the suggestion to add some monterey jack cheese, yum!

I just tried this recipe. They turned out excellent! I was afraid the coating would fall off while frying, but not at all. They were as good as they looked. Thank you for the recipe. I will make again for sure.

You might also like this: mix together cream cheese, shredded sharp cheddar cheese, green onions, bacon bits and dried pineapple (finely chopped).  Put this mixture into jalapeno halves (make sure to completely seed and remove all the white pith) and bake in the oven for 20 mins. (+/-) OR grill them outside.  
This eliminates frying, oil, breading.

I love this recipe and have made it quite a few times! To make it a little easier, I dice the jalapenos and add them to the cheese and bacon mix, instead of stuffing them. It helps to save time and they are still just as yummy!

I have made these for the last few years, great popper.  I leave a few seeds in  for heat. My suggestion is not to cut off the stems, slice the pepper through the stem and it gives each half a little handle.

I didn't use bacon and added salt, pepper, and garlic to the cheese and breadcrumbs but these were stellar.  What a great recipe.  Author wasn't kidding about the gloves though... I burned my lips and nose by touching them accidentally, watch out!

These were wonderful. My family ate them right up. I followed it exactly with home grown Jalapeno's and I wish I listened to the advise to leave some of the seeds in. They were wonderful but we would have loved more heat....

5 stars with mods....  The jalapenos this season have been been pretty lame.  To reclaim the heat I diced up a habanero and stirred it into the cheese and bacon mixture.  Also blanched the jalapenos first to soften a tad, and sprinkled in some cajun seaoning into the bread crumbs.

These were marvelous! I used buttermilk instead of regular milk, and seasoned bread crumbs. I also coated mozzarella string cheese for the kids. I put them in the freezer for about an hour before frying. The second time I added browned pork sausage to the cream cheese mixture, even better!

Wow - the name says it all.  These are better than poppers served in restaurants!!  The changes I made was I increased the bacon, I tripled dipped the poppers and froze the poppers before frying them.  The only problem we had was that we couldn't make enough of them!!

Yummy is an understatement. Hubby made these for my birthday dinner. He used milk and flour; then milk and breadcrumbs; then milk and panko breadcrumbs (by accident). Delicious!! Will make again and again!!

These were Delicious! I did minimize and add an egg to the milk. I also used Almond milk instead or regular and omitted the bacon bits. But other than that I will def make again! I served them with sweet red chilli sauce! What a great combo! Thanks for this great recipe!

Incredibly labor intensive! But darn TASTY!! I doubled the bacon bits and added a pinch of sugar to the filling mixture. 

Where the recipe says let sit for 10 minutes to dry, put them in the refrigerator. The cold makes the flour and breadcrumbs adhere better.

Part of me doesn't want to do all the dipping again and the other part of me wants to make like 10 dozen and freeze them. To be eaten as desired.

Delicious appetizer and snack! I made a half batch of these to have before and with dinner tonight! I blanched the jalapenos for 2 minutes in boiling water, then cooled them before filling them/dipping them. Used lowfat cream cheese instead of regular, and I also added double the bacon to the recipe, we ate most of them in 1 sitting! Yum :-)

1 dip into flour, 2 dips into Panko breadcrumbs, then fried in a smaller amount half chili oil/half veggie oil. Tasted delicious, but could have been spicier. Add chili powder to cream chese mixture next time.

I just made this for superbowl 46. It is great. acouple of things I did from other reviewers  was a to par boil the jalapenos for 2 minutes and they were just right. Also I would make sure to use extra sharp or sharp chedar for the flavor. I only had 1/2 a cup so I added a mexican blend and I think it would have been better with the Sharper chedar cheese. I prefer a little milder so I did make sure to get all the seeds and ribs out. I didnt have bacon bits so I used three slices of bacon and chopped them in food processor. I needed the bacon for the potatoe skins so it worked out great. Time consuming but definately resturant quality.

My husband loves this! I am not a fan of any hot foods, peppers & such, however we read the great reviews took into the considerations of some tweaking & it was awesome! I do agree if you're looking for more heat add the seeds in the mixture.

Great recipe, although i used sharp cheddar, mild cheddar, and egg batter instead of the milk in order to get a thicker breading on it.  Also mixed in a little parmesan cheese with Italian bread crumbs to add some crunch.

These were really good and the breading held up GREAT...they just needed a little more flavor for my family.  I'll make them again and just leave in some of the seeds.  I blanched the peppers like other people said, too.

wonderful!! Definitely better fried than baked.  We tried both.  The baked ones seemed a little bland add extra spices to the cream cheese mix if baking.

We brought these jalapeno poppers to a party and they really were a big hit.The only changes we made were omitting the cheddar cheese and using panko bread crumbs for the final coating. We served it with a hot pepper jelly. Yum.

FANTASTIC!  As many have already noted the key is in the patience needed for the triple dredging process. I varied from the directions by adding some herbs to the flour, and chose to use wheat flour for the last dredge.  I also chose not to cut my peppers in half, but rather mixed the filling in a ziploc bag, and cut the corner to pipe the filling into the peppers.  Since I had over 50 peppers, I took another reviewer's advice and flash froze them.  OMG!  With the price of frozen poppers, this will definitely be on my late summer/fall let's get ready for winter list in the future.

I made these because of the good reviews, but I honestly don't see what the hype is about.  it's a TON of prep time, and it's hard to get enough filling in the peppers, so you can't taste the filling.

I made this exact recipe and my hubby loved it, except I made them with homemade cheese. Then I started  doing some adaptations and finally this is how I make them. I use the same recipe, however I only cook them until the cheese is melted. No longer. They are the BEST, hot or cold.

These were delicious I used a mexican blend cheese instead of the cheddar.  I left the peppers whole, steamed them for 3 minuets, then cut a slit scooped out some of the seeds and filled.

These were so good! I use fresh white cheddar cheese & low fat cream cheese with turkey bacon bits. Also, instead of plain breadcrumbs,  I used Japanese panko breadcrumbs. They were gona extreely fast. My boyfriend & I had them with homemade pizza & salad. MMM!!!

These are unbelievable. Follow the breading procedure, it is worth it.  Add the jalapeno seeds to the filling for more heat.

I also added garlic salt to the flour and fresh chives to the filling.  I used the white Panko bread crumbs. I did not add bacon bits.

Great recipe! I used 16oz. cream cheese, 1 cup of cheddar, 1/4 cup bacon bits & 3/4 pkg onion soup mix. Also I used seasoned bread crumbs and blanched my jalapenos. Next time Im going to try chopping a pickled jalapeno or banana pepper to add to the cheese mix. I stuffed banana peppers too since we have a nice crop of both. Thank you so much for posting.
Everyone loved these so much last nite that they asked for more tonight. I did make one more change though, I added 1/4 cup finely chopped pickled banana peppers to the cheese mixture. They said that put them over the top!

These were pretty good!  

I don't understand all the comments about blandness -- the Jalapenos I used carried plenty of heat (even without seeds and ribs) and flavor to counterbalance the creaminess of all that cheese.

I used sliced jalapenos instead of halved and 1/3 less fat Philadelphia Cream Cheese to lower the heaviness of the recipe, then pan-fried the shaped poppers in olive oil. The results tasted phenomenal. 

My only problems were keeping the poppers shaped in the pan and, afterwards, keeping my roommates from wanting more.

These came out perfectly! They were a huge it.  The only thing I would do differently next time is leave more of the ribs in there so that there was a little more spice (I like things pretty spicy).

It's funny because I don't follow recipes well, & I guess I've made these so many times already, I never noticed the double coating! Well anyway, I add about 1/4 tsp salt to the cream cheese mixture, and I only coat them in bread crumbs once. (also I use egg 
instead of milk). I bake them instead of frying them. I bake them on 400 for 20-30 min till golden. They 
are very time consuming to make. But my hubby 
begs for them at LEAST once a week! My whole 
family loves them. I also suggest wearing gloves to handle the jalepenos.

I tried to use panko, and it didn't work out. Instead of frying, I opted for baking. It seemed like too much breading.

Pretty disappointed with this recipe.  There was really no flavor.  All the other reviews that I read made it sound like it was amazing.  I even used Pepperjack cheese and Italian flavored bread crumbs.  I would suggest that even if you don't like hot-ness, use the seeds and insides of the peppers.  They do freeze well, however, just really no flavor.

Started using this recipe last summer while many peppers were in the garden. Freezing them breaded this way, now mid-winter and still enjoying them anytime. We also used bananna peppers in this recipe. Turned out great, everyone loves them!

We really liked these.  We didn't have bacon so we left that out, and they were still really good.  I did take half the batch and did a double-coat of bread crumbs to see how they would turn out.  They were even better! I will do a double-coat on all of them next time.  Once they're coated in bread crumbs, dunk them back in the milk then again in the bread crumbs for extra crunch.  These would be great for entertaining...good finger-food that can be left out for a while!

Awesome Awesome awesome! Next time I will definitely put the seeds and the membranes in the cheese mixture to give it some kick though, they were great but no pop! Also, another reviewer suggested wearing gloves and I totally agree-I made them 4 hours ago and my hands STILL  burn! All in all a wonderful recipe!

I found the recipe to be very good, but make sure your jalapenos are hot!  Ours were not hot enough so they were lacking in taste.  The breading was perfect, stayed on jalapenos perfectly.  They were fun to make, but time consuming.

Really delicious! Some hints: to make the poppers not so crunchy (some do not like the texture), blanch peppers in boiling water for 2 minutes, followed by an ice bath. Save some of the seeds and add them to the cheese mixture for a little spice. Finally, chilled ranch dressing is the perfect dipping sauce for these babies!!

I found this recipe some time ago, and have been making it from memory, so it has become a bit different, like a game of telephone... I roll the cheese mixture around a piece of jalapeno, and add a bit of chipotle seasoning to the cheese mixture. Then I dredge the cheese balls in flour, dip in egg, then roll in breadcrumbs and repeat once. I deep fry them for only a minute or so, as the cheese starts to leak out if I leave them any longer. It's plenty enough to make them crispy and melty, though. Yummy!!

This recipe took me from "what the heck am I supposed to do with all these peppers??? " to " we need to plant more next year, many more!!! Time consuming but well worth it, may as well do a big batch because they really don't last long.

I've never had jalapeno poppers before and had alot of jalapenos to use up. Made these only changing bacon bits to crumbled bacon. Everything else was the same as the recipe. Everyone that had them said they were by far the best they ever had. Thanks for the recipe.

I had some fresh jalepenos, so I decided to try this. I left out the bacon bits, because I don't care for them. I read some reviews that said these were bland, so I added garlic and onion powder to the flour and bread crumbs. The taste was great! The only reason why I am rating it a 4, is because the jalepenos were still kind of "crunchy." I wasn't sure how that could have been overcome? Maybe, boiling the peppers a little before stuffing? Either way it was a nice way to dress up peppers and they fried up nicely and held together well.

This recipe is easy and the breading stays on, but my only complaint is that  with plain bread crumbs,it is VERY BLAND. The only thing I did to change it up was mix crushed crackers (saltines or buttery round) and a little salt and that made all the difference. VERY GOOD!

Excellent and easy. I stuffed the poppers and then placed in freezer until ready to coat. Also used seasoned bread crumbs. I did not blanch and they were perfect. The freezing may have softened the peppers slightly.

all I can say is fantastic recipe, followed exactly. I also made deep fried balls with just the Jalapeno filling for those who dont like the peppers.  I used a deep fryer, and agree with others that taking out the seeds takes out the heat, will leave some in next time.

Wow- this really is good!  So much better than any I have had in restaurants and definitely better than the frozen variety.  I also blanched my peppers- seemed to help the coating stick and they were perfect after frying- not mushy but not crunchy. I also only coated twice- once in the flour and once in the breadcrumbs. Excellent recipe- I am going to try making them to freeze.

Thanks!  I loved your poppers! I made bacon from scatch and add more bacon. Added garlic powder.  I tried baking to be healthy, that worked great. Ranch for dipping.  Tracy, PA

These were amazing! I followed the recipe very closely, but did not add bacon as I didn't have any handy. I added some spices to the cream cheese mixture and to the bread crumbs to make sure the flavor really popped. These turned out SO good, even better than the ones that you can buy frozen at the grocery store. Mine did overflow a bit in the oil, but just very little of the cheese seeped out, most of it stayed inside.   I made a huge batch of 40-50 poppers and froze most of them. I have heated some up in the toaster oven about a week later and they are excellent! Just wait for them to cool and toss them into a freezer bag!

Excellent! I had a container of jalepeno's that needed to be utilized. I quickly found this recipe, sounded easy enough. Unfortunately, it took longer to make than to eat, they were delish! I plan to make quite often.

These are absolutely AMAZING! I have been using this recipe for quite some time now. Every time that I make these they just disappear...which is sad for all of the time involved :(  I just made a batch of 50 for the football game and only 6 remain, and we are fighting over who will get to have some later :)

Turned out great.  I used Panko bread crumbs and it coated them completely.  Takes a bit of time so next time I will do alot more and freeze the rest.

Excellent recipe, I have used it many times and people LOVE them.  I add taco seasoning to the cheese mixture for extra flavor and seeds  for more heat.

This came out awesome! The only thing I'd change would be to probably keep a good portion of the seeds in. As good as they were, I believe the cream cheese takes out any spicy factor of the actually poppers. Keep the seeds in for a spicier taste!

Good recipe, however it should be more clearly stated that can cause serious burns from cutting and seeding the jalapenos. I spent about four hours after dinner with my hands in cold milk and then went to bed with two bags of cold ice. MAKE SURE YOU WEAR RUBBER GLOVES!!

This is an AWESOME recipe.  I did make a few changes, but nothing major.  (I didn't measure out everything exactly - just added until it looked the way I wanted it to look).  I did use my homemade panko instead of the bread crumbs (need at least 3 cups - I think I ended up using 4) but they were fantasic.  They may be time comsuming - but making the extra and freezing are a MUST!!!  Boughten may be easier - but HOMEMADE is ALWAYS 100% tastier!  Making more today - as my family has been begging for them for 2 months.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!!!! =)

So yummy! Rather than leaving the jalapenos whole. I cut them into bite size pieces before stuffing, and breading! This is a must try, and a keeper!

Very good. The first time I made them they weren't hot at all but I cleaned out every part of the ribs and seads. The next time I left the ribs and they were perfect.

These are incredible.  They absolutely disappeared in minutes, and everybody raved about them as the "best" they've ever tasted.  They cooked perfectly too-topping stayed in place and the center was gooey and yummy.  Surprisingly easy too!  A keeper for sure.

Made these several months ago and my family just loved them.  My husband has been asking for these again so I am starting the process this afternoon.  I've bought enough to make lots and lots and plan to freeze a batch so in a few weeks I can surprise my peeps to these again.  Labor intense but well worth it.  I may try this round to blanching the peppers and peeling the outter skin off, cooling and then starting the filling and breading steps.

These were amazing - possibly the best poppers I've ever had.  They were noticeably better, fresher, and healthier tasting than restaurant poppers, which are often the frozen variety.  As someone else mentioned, they are incredibly labor intensive, so they're not something I would whip together without a darn good reason.  But when that reason exists, it's well worth the work.

I have to  say that I took the advice of one other and added some heat to the recipe; however, it was still not enough.  I gave it only two stars simply because I expected a lot more bite and less bland of a filling.  I may try recipe again with a hotter pepper or grind the seeds and infuse into the filling.  I do agree with the process of flour & bread crumbs; although time consuming the coating was just right.

These were amazing. The reviewer who told us to wear gloves . . .would that I had listened to you.    Our first batch of poppers were WAAAY too hot, even for my husband who is a lover of hot food. This was not due to the recipe however but due to the jalepenos being an unusually hot bunch.     So next time we made them we made sure they were rinsed really well. And DO wear gloves, i didn't and my hands felt like they were on fire for hours.     I blanched the peppers first to make them softer and added some salt to my breadcrumbs. Other than that this recipe is perfect and the coating proceedure may loko excessive but it is totally worth it.

These were delicious.. I had to make about 70 of these for a party, and it is time consuming stuffing a lot of them, breading, and frying.. But they did come out good.  Received many compliments.

There are amazing, I make them for parties and someone always asks for the recipie.  I double the recipe, fry, and then freeze them.  Few tips: I use a measuring spoon to seed the peppers, and chop 1/3-1/2 of the seeds and viens and add it to the cheese mixture with a few splashes of tabasco. The seed mixture is what makes it hot, without it they are pretty mild.  I also use a pound of crumbled bacon for the double recipe.  After freezing you can reheat in the oven at 450 for about 15 minutes or so.  Ps, wear gloves, even if it doesn't feel like the peppers are buring you, they are! ...andyou will feel it later.

Great recipe! I used real bacon and crumbled it up and i also seasoned the cheese mixture with season salt,pepper, hot sauce, and some pickled jalapeno peppers. I also blanched the peppers. It turned out really well it jus time comsuming. I advise to make the day before and just freeze and warm them up in the oven.

These were pretty good!  I boiled the jalapeños for about 4 or 5 minutes to soften them up, used diced turkey bacon in place of the bacon bits, and used Italian bread crumbs.  I added cayenne pepper and salt to the bread crumbs for a little more flavor.  I will definitely leave some seeds in next time though, as they weren't very spicy at all.

Awesome popper recipe!  The only change I made making these the first time was to blanch the peppers before stuffing them to soften them up.  As is these have almost no heat.  I have tried both throwing a hand full of the seeds in with the cheese mixture and dusting the tops with ground cayenne in other tries and they both work equally well.  Fun side note, any extra cheese that is left over can be rolled into bite size balls and breaded as well.  Makes excellent cheese ball snacks for kids.

This recipe is great. I used panko instead of traditional breadcrumbs and only had to coat them once (in the breadcrumbs). My boyfriend endearingly pegged them "japanapeno poppers". Can't wait to toy around with this recipe some more.

Fantastic! Be sure to scoop out the jalepenos really well. Some I did a little better than others. So some were hotter than others. But I didn't mind the heat. I also recommend wearing gloves cause my hands were burning a few hours later.

These were fantastic, I made them with a slightly higher ratio of bacon:cream cheese, and with pepper jack cheese. I didn't blanche the peppers before hand, as some reviewers did, I just fried them for a few extra minutes, about 5-6 each.

I used about 12 piecese  of bacon in my filling.  I also had enough filling for about 70 poppers.  I needed way more bread crumbs, flour and milk to coat 70 poppers.  If you don't want to make that many then plan on having some filling left or cut it in half.  We baked a few of these per some of the reviews and they turned out very dry so we fried the rest and they were wonderful.  I also blanched the jalapenos prior to stuffing them and wish I had kept them in a little longer.  The horseradish sauce that someone included in a review goes very well with these.

I made these for a party I was having and they were a HUGE hit.  Although it is time consuming I recommend you follow the instructions and coat the poppers all three time.  It made all the difference in the world.  I will definitely be making these again!

I wish I had known beforehand that the membranes on these suckers pack heat as well. Ty Rich, for your review. I might as well have left the seeds in! However, I won't blame the recipe for my mistake. These were pretty good but take forever to make so I would suggest you prepare these suckers hours before serving.  To make sure the seeds are out, rinse the jalapeños or dump them in a bowl and fill with water and pick them out because seeds could have tacked back on in the handling process.  I will definitely try these again but NO membranes. If you want to leave them on, I have to say beware. Not even my husband, who adores spicy food, could wolf these down.  Overall though, great recipe.  If you follow as is, you'll get it right every time.

We made these a few weeks ago after we found ourselves with so many Jalapeno peppers in our garden.  They were excellent!! The only change we made was using Panko instead of regular bread crumbs.  They gave these an excellent crunch!  Great recipe!

These were good,you definitely need to blanch them first. Followed recipe, next time I will add some salt to the mix they needed more flavor. Make sure you have a lot of time to spare because these babies take a while.

The process was great. I double breaded mine and they turned out just as coated and crispy but I dipped them in egg rather than water. I found the filling to be a little bland as well. I added a pinch of salt and pepper and a tiny bit of garlic powder just to bump up the flavor the second time I made them and they were incredible!

Very tasty - couldn't stop eating them. I used Panko breadcrumbs and poppers came out very crunchy. Also, I used few little sweet peppers and they came out very tasty as well. Thanks for recipe!

These were absolutely delicious.  I couldn't stop eating them.  I only had Italian flavored bread crumbs so that's what I used, and the flavor was great.  Next time I may take a user's suggestion of blanching the peppers first so they won't be so crunchy, but it's not a must.  I froze the leftovers and reheated at 425 for 15 minutes.  Still amazing!

these were extremely time-consuming to make, but pretty delicious in the end. after doing a test batch, I discovered that the jalapeños are too tough and too spicy if left alone, so I blanched the rest of them in boiling water for 1-2 mins. I found I needed much more milk, flour, & breadcrumbs than the recipe called for. at the same time, I was left with a great deal of extra cheese mixture -- so the proportions are a bit off, but the end result was mighty tasty. oh! and I seasoned the breadcrumbs with some Creole seasoning that I had on hand -- recommended.

I made these this week. There is only 2 of us so I made the recipe up fully cooked them, and then froze them in a gallon freezer bag. I took out a few later in the week, and reheated them in the oven for about 15 minutes on 350degrees. They were even still crispy. I will premake them and use them for parties in the future.

Can I give this recipe TEN stars? AWESOME. #1 WARNING: USE GLOVES! I made of mistake of not and paid for it, but it was well worth it. I stuffed the peppers the night before, then battered and fried them the morning of Superbowl Sunday. People raved about them!

First of all, love these, considering how time-consuming they were. But if you love Jalepeno poppers, VERY much worth it. Two things: I will follow others' advice next time and blanche the peppers first. The peppers were a tad too firm, and separated from the outer shell when I ate them. Also, I'm not very experienced when it comes to frying, so make sure your oil isn't too hot, otherwise they'll burn. I experimented with the heat, and now they're perfect.

Do these just like told, make sure like others say you double coat them made the outside of the popper perfect, these tasted so fresh, loved them! I also boiled them after I gutted the peppers in boiling water for a couple minutes, everyone at my party LOVED them, VERY time consuming though, will only do these on very special occasions.

THESE WERE FANTASTIC! I skipped the bacon (which I think lost a bit of sweet taste to the popper) because I really didn't want to open my deep freezer reserve bacon for just 1 strip. They were still good and my husband ate 8 of them by himself. ***UPDATE*** For the Super Bowl, I decided to make 50 of these poppers with a few modifications. Will have to wait until they are eaten to get final review.

These were fantastic to eat, but a pain to make. The variations that I took from other reviews: used taco seasoning and some seeds in the stuffing for heat (this made it medium hot), used garlic and herb bread crumbs, and I froze these before frying. If I made them again, I would do the following: 1) try to buy the largest jalapenos you can - easier to stuff and remove membranes from; 2) I bought 25 small jalapenos (that's all that was there) and that only used up half of the stuffing - which is fine - I'll buy more and use later.

If you've never made these and aren't always in the kitchen (like me) then allow yourself about 90 mins.  

SO YUMMY!

PHENOMENAL!  Restaurant quality! I was looking for a good popper recipe and you DID IT!  I did blanch the peppers first to soften them up, just a bit, but didn't remove the skin as some have mentioned here.  I did leave some seeds in to keep some heat!!  I also altered the cheddar cheese for Pepperjack cheese and added just a touch of garlic salt to cheese mixture.  I also used seasoned bread crumbs for some added flavor.
I think the triple dipping is key here and was amazed that they are completely covered after frying - PERFECT!!!
I'm only saddened by the fact I only made about 40 of them. We grew an obscene amount of jalapenos this year, but I had already canned the rest of them.
Time consuming, but SO WORTH IT!  I will definitely make TONS with next years crop and freeze them.  Can't thank you enough for this recipe!!!!

Didn't read enough of the reviews to know to parboil the peppers first.  Bet that would've made seeding them easier!  Anyway, I didn't have as many jalapenos as I thought so we used assorted peppers of the correct size from the garden.  Rave reviews on all!

Absolutely fantastic!  I have never had jalapeno poppers before and I have to admit, I'm not sure why I waited.  My recipe made about 40 and by the end of the night I think I had 3 left on the table.  Thanks for sharing a wonderful and tasty recipe!

these were very good.  I had to make a few changes because I didn't have some ingredients. I added green onion instead of bacon and cornflake crumbs instead of bread crumbs. I made extra and froze them so hopefully they'll turn out great also!

I used your recipe as a base but instead of adding cheddar cheese, I added a small amount of blue cheese and a bit of grated mozzarella along with bacos.  For the second dipping I used egg instead of milk with the bread crumbs.  The coating stayed on great and they were DELICIOUS!

These are yummy, but a lot of work (especially wearing gloves...which i learned the hard way that you shoud do when dealing with jalapenos).  I think this would be great with pepperjack, but since I didn't have any I seasoned my cheese blend with lots of garlic and onion salt.

Pretty good!  would like to suggest adding a little salt and cayenne pepper to the cheese mixture for flavor.

This is a great recipe...I used canned whole peppers since they are out of season and they worked great.  I did use pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar and they really have a kick!  This will be a huge success at Christmas!
Thanks...

Very tasty!  We used home-grown jalapenos from our garden and even though we didn't have any bacon bits, they were delicious!

Good!! I did not use the bacon bits. I cored my jalapenos instead of halving them, then blanched them for about 4 minutes. I then used the ziplog baggie trick to pipe the filling in, used toothpicks to put the pepper tops back on, then moved on to coating the peppers. The coating part was time consuming and annoying, but oh well. Finally, I baked them at 350 for about 40 minutes instead of frying. They were tasty! Thanks!

Crunchy...yummy...with just a tiny bit of heat.  I was surprised the filling stayed in when we fried in my cast iron skillet..plan on making a double batch this weekend and maybe adding cayenne to half...mmmm (I was able to reheat the next day and they were still crunchy good)

These were scrumptious!!!  We stood at the counter and ate them as fast as we could take them out of the frying pan.  It does take quite a bit of time, but I wouldn't hesitate to make them often, they're that good.  Thanks for posting the recipe.

AWESOME!!  I also had extra stuffing so I did banana peppers from the garden and they were SUPER good too.  Like everyone said, it takes some time to prepare but they are so yummy.  I didnt add a thing.

Takes time but saves money compared to buying them.  I have made this recipe several times, my suggests are: 1) Use Old Cheddar - otherwise they taste bland, 2) Wear gloves when handling the peppers - otherwise they will sting and you will need to ice your hands, 3) After frying, sometimes the peppers were still a bit crunchy/uncooked - next time I will try grilling the jalapeno halves before using them.

I made this recipe because I had over 4 dozen jalepenos ripen at the same time, and now I grow them just for this recipe!  Use this technique, but you can vary the flavor to your likings.  I don't like bacon, and add chopped peppers and cheese.  Everyone loves them.  Don't worry about leakage...they all leak....its still awesome!

My boyfriend went crazy over these !! He thought I bought them at a restaurant.  These are definitely the best Jalapeno poppers i've ever tasted-- i omitted the bacon because I dont't eat pork, and they were still fabulous!

These were ok, but takes lots of steps to make. If you're a big jalapeno popper fan then I'll say it's worth it. I just made them to try out.

These are fantastic!  I only had about 8 jalapenos from the garden and decided to try this since it's been in my recipe box for months.  I didn't measure out anything - just put the ingredients together in amounts I thought looked about right.  I probably went heavy on the real bacon bits. I found that the filling stayed in just fine and double-dipping with the bread crumbs is the key, I think.  Mine came out absolutely beautiful with no leakage whatsoever.  I added a little cayenne to the bread crumbs but that's really the only thing I changed.  I loved the bacon in the filling.  I don't think it was too much of a hassle..it was well worth the effort.  My husband said "Awesome!"  Thanks for a great recipe!

I didn't like Jalepeno Poppers. My husband loves them but is never impressed with those he orders at restaurants. I made these an hour ago and, not only did he declare them the absolute best he had ever tasted, but I thought they were really good too! Like others, I briefly boiled the jalepenos to soften them, and I used 1/2 Pepper Jack cheese with half extra-sharp Cheddar. Yes, these are rather time-consuming but boy are they worth it!

These really are the best. I get asked to make these all the time and they never ever last. I usually dont put the bacon in it and serve it with ranch. Ive used crab in it before and it was good too. These are best eaten right away but man they are wonderful!

A Very good recipe! A little time comsuming but really are worth it. I have used this recipe many times over but never rated it until today. I usually add more bacon though and I use seasoned bread crumbs when i have it on hand. These really are the best jalapeno poppers I have ever made.

These are great! I scaled the recipe down because I only had one package of cream cheese. I also left out the bacon bits cuz I didn't have any on hand. WOW! The peppers did come out crunchy, but I liked that. Froze the leftover so we'll se how those turn out. The only thing I might do different next time is dip them in the bread crums two or three more times to get a little bit more coating.

A VERY good method.  The layers of bread crumbs work beautifully.  No leaks in frying at all.  YUM YUM! I blanched the peppers first to make them a little softer.

YUM!!  Very simple as far as ingredients go and it was easy.  Although slicing & seeding the jalapenos and letting them dry between "dippings" took some time, it was well worth it!  Next time I will leave out the bacon.

I made these for my son and he loved them. I'm not a big fan of spicy, but they weren't so hot. I took some of the advice from the comments and bleached them in hot water for a few minutes. The triple dipping absolutely works and I used crushed cereal instead of the bread kind.

Amazing! The only change I made was gourmet sharp cheddar cheese, real bacon and added some garlic powder. I also used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. Thank you all for the tips on freezing these beauties! I have an abundant crop of jalapenos this year so will be nice in the winter to have a fresh jalapeno popper! diffently will make agian!

The flavor was great. Raspberry jam to dip is a must.  The filling was 1 package of cream cheese, 4 slices bacon, garlic salt, little cheddar. Really need to blanch the pepper before filling and frying. They were too crunchy. Plain cheap bread crumbs and fry in peanut oil. Finish with salt fresh out of the frier.

Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. These were extremely bland. Needs more salt - both in the filling and in the breading.

These came out great! And were super easy to make. My hubby loved and devoured them as soon as they came out. Only thing I changed is I blanched the peppers for 3 minutes and cooled them in ice water before the process. We love spicy food so I mixed in the seeds from the peppers into the cream cheese mixture. The spicier the better! Once stuffed and coated, I baked them in the oven (350) for 30 minutes instead of frying. They had the perfect amount of crunch & heat

Like several people I used this recipe as a jumping off place; I modified it to fit my tastes and dietary guidelines. I’m a type 2 diabetic and follow ketogenic a diet so I skipped the milk bath, flour and breadcrumbs. 
I doubled the amount of bacon, using real bacon, with an equal quantity of chopped pepperoni. Equal portions of onion powder and garlic powder raised the flavor level. I cut off both ends of the peppers and blanched for 2 minutes in boiling water. This made them easier to remove the insides and milder. Instead of halving them I laid them flat on the cutting board and split one side. After removing the seeds with the back of my cutting knife I spooned in the cheese mixture and folded them closed against themselves. 
Lastly, I used the baking sheet I used to bake the bacon with melted residual bacon fat on it and baked them in the oven instead of deep frying.

This is my first review ever. I feel these deserved it. They were awesome as is. Made these a second time when my daughter got home from university, but had to leave out the bacon for her dietary choice. They were still good but I felt they were missing something. The reason for this review is because she just used the same coating method for Babybel cheese sticks and they were great! Thanks for the awesome recipe.

I use 18 jalapenos, when halved is 36. I use 1- 8 oz bag of triple cheddar shredded cheese, 12 oz pack of cream cheese and 1 pack of bacon... yes, 1 pack. If you use 1 table spoon of bacon bits, this will taste bland. Who da f uses 1 tablespoon of bacon on anything to begin with? I also season the flour with salt, garlic powder, and onion powder. I use Panko bread crumbs with regular bread crumbs seasoned with parsley and garlic. If you do this recipe as listed, you may be disappointed.... BUT do it the way I have provided, they will be da best!!!

Absolutely delicious! Friends said they were the best poppers they ever had. I did make a couple of ingredient swaps. I used pepperoni because I had no bacon. I also didn't have enough cheddar cheese, so I used half cheddar and half pepper jack. The pepperoni was good, but I think the bacon will taste even better, next time I make this.

Made without bacon (I don't eat it), added some seasonings to the cream cheese mix and breadcrumbs.  Baked as suggested by another rater.

This was my first time deep frying poppers.  I usually halve, wrap in bacon and then broil.

I processed one jalapeno (go to technique to add natural heat) and put that in the stuffing mix.  Unfortunately, it wasn't quite spicy enough.  

I also cheat like crazy with the cream cheese.  Get the chive whipped stuff.  It saves SOOOO much time.

Also, if you want extra crispy, I did a 1/3 - 2/3 mix of potato flakes and bread crumbs for the dry coating.  I seasoned the breading with parm and Italian seasoning as well.

Lessons learned:
1. Don't throw out seeds until I get the heat I want in the stuffing.

2. Use a wet batter / dry coating method vs what is recommended.  You just can't beat tried and true Southern Deep Frying. The dry batter will be 1/3 each flour, potato flakes and seasoned bread crumbs from now on.  If I'm lazy, I'll just use fish fry batter for the wet and dry.

3. Peanut oil is king.

Future Ideas:
1. I want to try not halving them and just scooping and stuffing.

2. Either way, I'm layering more in the peppers.  A little stuffing mix, small strip of fresh chewy bacon, more stuffing mix and then I'll bread.  You just can't beat fresh bacon flavor.

I made this with my husband last night. We were really happy with it. 

Two changes I did was baked about 4 slices of fresh bacon and cut it finely to add in. Used much more than the amount called for and it was better imo.

I sliced my Jalapenos in half and boiled them with the seeds in for about 2 minutes. I might do 3-4 minutes next time for even softer jalapenos.  

I'm not sure if boiling them with the seeds in still contributed to the heat but my poppers were spicy AF!  My husband and I eat a lot of spicy foods and our eyes were red and watering!  For those who may feel like they are not spicy enough by the normal recipe, try this step next time.

They are just wonderful. Recommend a jalapeno corer tool and disposable gloves. We noted that the jalapeno gigantics are not spicy hot if grilled or baked. Clearing out the seeds and ribs well reduces the heat factor for the most part.

I made these today with jalapenos from the garden.  I used a Sargento 4 cheddar mix, and more bacon than called for.    plan to use even a little more bacon next time.
These things are REALLY good.  the breading stayed on perfect using the recipe and video instructions.  The filling was nice a creamy.   Only  a little oozed out when deep frying.  Peppers were nice texture after deep frying to a golden brown.
Much better than I've had from any restaurant.
I made a bunch and freezed most from the first batch before cooking.

As other reviewer said, it came out completely blend. It would be great idea to put some salt (to taste) in the all purpose flour. Also, use sharp cheddar cheese (little more then quantity than suggested in recipe).

I don't eat pork so I left out the bacon bits and stuffed some mushrooms too!!  I didn't repeat the bread crumbs and I thought they were great.  Don't crowd the pan and watch so the cheese doesn't ooze out.  Thank you for the recipe!

I’ve never had a better jalapeño popper! I order them in restaurants all the time but they never come close to how yummy these are. The triple-dipping is definitely worth the time and effort. And, as other reviewers have said, they freeze really well after frying. I used a deep-fryer and they came out so delicious! Thank you for the recipe!

I initially made this recipe as called for. Like many i found it flavorless and not very spicy (full disclosure I usually use habanero peppers instead of jalapeños to add spiciness). The second time i made this i did the following. I kept the peppers whole, but removed the seeds. I then placed the seeds in a separate bowl and mixed it with garlic powder and chipotle powder. I then cooked the peppers for 2 minutes in boiling water. After removing them i mixed the seed mixture in with the cheese filling. I also used Italian bread crumbs and added garlic powder, pepper, and chipotle powder. I then did the 3 coat process. Cooking it this way they definitely had a kick and were more flavorful. I can’t really tell you how much i used of each ingredient, just what looked right.

This is the first time I tried to make this recipe; and, overall, it was a good experiment.   The poppers didn't turn out perfect, but I thought they were OK and I was glad that I found a way to use up this year's bumper crop of jalapenos.  The breading was too thick and crunchy for my liking.   Next time, I just won't work as hard to make it stick to the chilis.   Additionally, the breading turned golden brown a bit too early in the hot oil, so the chilis were a little raw and crunchy on the inside.  In the future, I am just going to try boiling the chilis for a few minutes and let them cool before stuffing them.  Lastly, I  found the filling to be a bit bland.   Next time, I will try to reduce the amount of cream cheese and add more  shredded cheddar instead.    Still, I thought this wasn't too bad for a first try.

For never having made poppers before I found this recipe surprisingly easy. I didn't quite understand the "halves" part so I cut the stems off at a healthy angle and used a shrimp fork to scrape the insides clean of membrane and seeds. Melted the cream cheese in the microwave then added a whole bag of Mexican blend cheese and bacon bits. Stuffed the peppers by putting the cream cheese blend in a bag and cutting the tip off like for frosting a cupcake. Made 12 of these as a trial for a party, and they were gone within minutes. I do recommend freezing over night as my friend with a deep fryer said that anything not frozen falls apart.

I made these bad boys in a lesson to learn how to bread things like this. I used Fresno Chile peppers instead of jalepeño peppers. They came out very good and I will likely start making these for events.

Like others suggested, I blanched the peppers, which was a good idea. They came out excellently, and everyone loved them, but I feel as if they could use a little more heat. This can be easily be remedied with hot sauce (I like sriracha sauce), but just keep that in mind. I also didn't use bacon bits.

Instead of bacon bits, I added some Knorr Vegetable dip mix to the cream cheese and used a sharp cheddar/Swiss cheese mixture - the filling was delicious.  

I also blanched the peppers for 2-3 minutes.  The triple-dip preparation takes time, but the reviews were all positive - some of the best jalapeño poppers people had ever had.

I switched from using just milk to making an egg wash (adding a couple eggs to the milk). I noticed the wash made the breading stick together better, and typically when breading something for deep frying you either want to use egg or an egg wash anyway. Loved the recipe will definitely make it again. The changes I made, I used panko breading instead of ordinary bread crumbs, added a little extra bacon and substituted an egg wash for the milk. Like I said great recipe!

I gave this four stars as I agree with some of the other posters that the filling is a little bland as written so to it I added some smoked paprika and a dab of chilli garlic paste for added kick and it was just what was needed.  Very good!  Also blanched the peppers first.

When I first made these I thought they were kind of bland but I'm trying it again and leaving a few seeds in them so they are a bit spicy and I added some salt to the filling. I don't know we will see. But I was hoping to taste the pepper a bit, I did not. I will update on the Second make later, fingers crossed. Oh I did not use bacon and I used extra sharp cheese and cream cheese, it's what I had.

These were okay. I followed the recipe exactly except no bacon. There was way too much filling for the jalapenos. I'll have to throw a ton of it away or think of something else to use it for. I feel that the skin should be peeled off before coating. Next time I will cook these, put them in a bowl and cover for 10 min, then peel the skins off. The coating should stick much better after doing this.

Great recipe! I did exactly as recipe says. 
Next time I will blanche  the peppers for 2-3 min. When I fried these, I wanted it to be light golden in color and I find that the allowed time did not "cook" the jalapeños. Also for those of you finding that the jalepenos is too spicy, blavhing will decrease the "heat".
Thanks for posting Heather!

These were very very good .. but did do a few changes  .. I used Reg. Milk . And real Bacon . Alco used Panko Bread Crumbs .. I did go by the Recipe the first time and it needed to be changed a little so you can see what I did do and that is what it needed .. I made 50 on them the second time and they were gone the same night .. WOW So the next day went to the store and got more Jalapenos and made over a 100 of them to freeze .. THey were so very good .. Even made some without the cheader cheese just used cream cheese and the were just as good .. Thanks for the Recipe ..Panko Bread Crumbs is the Best to use ..Ray from Kansas

I've made this twice, but I liked the way it came out the second time better.  Very time consuming, but I made about 80 and froze some of them.

Definitely wear gloves while deseeding the jalapenos.  I used turkey bacon in the filling.  Keeping the gloves on, press the mixture into the jalapenos with your hands, rather than spooning it in- this helps keep the filling in place.  I dipped the jalapenos in milk/flour, waited 10 min, dipped it in milk/breadcrumbs, waited 10 min, and then dipped again in milk/breadcrumbs.  I made my own breadcrumbs too from whole wheat bread.  I would recommend not using all the breadcrumbs at once, but rather in batches so that the breadcrumbs don't become soggy. 

Then, I put them in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 min.  These were delicious! The first time I made this recipe, I deep fried the poppers, but I have to say I liked the taste of the baked ones better.   

I only  made 20 of them that day.  I froze the rest PRIOR to baking.  They come out great even after frozen.

I would recommend spraying a baking sheet so that they don't stick to it.  This is a great recipe, great way to use jalapenos, and a great way to make a nice appetizer ahead of time!!

Oh my this was a wonderful dish! I made this in my cooking class at my school, and it's wonderful simply wonderful. I then made this  for a graduation party and this was just to die for! Cutting the peppers can be a little tedious , I honestly prefer the canned peppers, because they're softer and smaller then user whole fresh ones

I just made this today - they are absolutely delicious!  I made them exactly as written.  I'm reading comments here and there about them not being flavorful enough?  One thing I did do is I seasoned the flour and breadcrumbs with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder - you have to season these two things, or they won't be as flavorful - I do this whenever I am cooking anything - always season all the steps!

just got done eating these wonderful little buggers, i substituted Ghost Peppers instead of Jalapenos, boy ooh boy were they good, the stuffing mix really cuts down on the peppers heat, so if the Jalapenos just dont have enough oomph for you try a hotter pepper... so tasty!!!

We were so disappointed with this recipe - made these for a football party at home and the prep took forever and hardly anyone ate them. The flavor wasn't that great and we were left with a bunch of leftovers. Won't make this one again.

Added ranch dressing mix & french onion soup mix, with cheddar/jack mixed cheese & a big spoonful of sour cream. It was a trial run & I didn't have bacon readily available.  No problem,  they turned out awesome. Also, had some Ritz crackers that I wanted to use up, mixed them with breadcrumbs & yum! Lastly.... back to my food service/bartending days... I never order poppers out any more b'c they were always best with a raspberry sauce that we served... no where has it anymore,  BUT I had homemade blackberry jam, OH MY! I may never order poppers out again!  350 baked, took a while til cheese was good, but we'll worth the wait :)

Outstanding breading recipe - extremely crispety -crunchety! I did make changes to amp them up (also used what was in the garden) Peppers included some jalapeños, mariachi peppers, and Hungarian wax . For the filling I added in diced scallion, diced cilantro, smoked chipotle pepper flakes,  garlic powder, and salt and pepper.  Adds great dimension of flavor! Great recipe, takes some time, but so worth it. Freezes extremely well (just like the ones from the store)

This is a great recipe for restaurant style poppers, but I'd like to address a couple of complaints by reviewers. One called them bland. I would never use just plain flour. This is an opportunity to add flavor! I added 1/2 tsp Lowrey's Seasoned Salt, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, and 1/2 tsp black pepper to the flour.

The other complaint was that the peppers weren't hot. A smooth, green jalapeño is going to taste similar to a bell pepper once you remove the seeds. You can add some seeds back into the cheese mix as one poster suggested, or you can buy hotter jalapeños. To select hotter peppers at the store, look for peppers with white striations on the outer skin. The more veins, the hotter! Be careful! Note these are striations, not wrinkles. The skin should otherwise be smooth and green.

One other flavor factor would be to use Italian seasoned bread crumbs. Hope this helps!

This recipe was the bomb! A little time consuming to follow the breading steps, allowing to dry in between. But it was worth the time and effort. The crust was perfect! My husband raved and we are making them again tonight.

These were pretty amazing! Time consuming, messy, but worth it. We skipped the bacon, sprinkled with salt when they came out, and dipped in chipolte ranch dressing. Addictive!

I use panko but have done the bread crumbs. They always say to allow to dry but I have fudged it a bit. Still turn out great. I usually freeze about 30 peppers and do a lot of fresh from garden. I also use the low fat cream cheese ( neufchatel) and bacon for inside hmm love this one. best appetizer  and even good cold.

Thought this was a great recipe, only thing I didn't love was the Breading on the outside. Not sure why, but it was super Thick and got kinda hard. For the 2nd batch I turned down the heat a little bit and fried them a little longer and it came out better, but overall these were great.

Super easy to make for anyone who has minimal experience. Very very easy. Follow the recipe, use shredded cheddar.

Great recipe, my house loved it. I think I went light on the cheddar though, I doubled the recipe and got a little lazy shredding a full pound of the cheese haha. Definitely going to be making it again, though as with all things it could use more bacon, so I'll be doubling/tripling or lining each jalapeño half with a small wedge of the good stuff.

I made these last nights for some friends--it was burrito night-- and they were the bomb!  I used Neufchatel and Colby Jack and put them back together before breading.  Also, I skipped the bacon because my guests were vegetarians. They raved  about them!

We made a couple hundred of these and they were amazing.  They store well in the freezer. We tried them both fried and baked.  The baked ones were terrible.  The fried ones were delicious. When you go to fry them, lay them cheese side up so it won't slip out.  Thank you for the recipe!

These turned out perfect.  I made them the day before I fried them and froze them over night.  I then fried them while they were still frozen.  Did this to set the coating.  My family loved them.  The jalapenos were still a little crunchy so I might blanch them next time before stuffing, but other than that perfect recipe.

I made a double batch and was glad that I did.  These poppers are fantastic.  They are labor intensive,  but wellworth it in the end.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and they turned out sooo good!  I also made the sweet  and sour dipping sauce found on all recipes  and they paired up perfectly.

I made these for a little Mexican Fiesta for my son and daughter-in-law to be. I boiled/blanched the peppers for 3 1/2 minutes (they were a nice plump size so this did not over soften or ruin the texture), this step made them  perfectly tender.  I followed the directions exactly from there. I used kitchen food type gloves to halve and de-seed them, the oils and seeds can irritate the skin and burn hot, this step prevents this.    I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs... all I had... they were great.
Guests were impressed with  how these looked and tasted. They looked professionally  made and  amazing...I will make these again and again for family and friends who love them. I made chipotle dip and had sour cream to dip in.

We decided to coat the poppers 1 time with flour and milk and twice with bread crumbs. They turned out great we also didn't put bacon in them. We will make them again.

I made these exactly per recipe.  They were the bomb.  My husband (and I agree) said they were the best jap poppers he's ever eaten. When I harvest japs from my garden next year, I intend to make a BUNCH of these and freeze them for eating throughout the winter.  I don't know how anyone can give this recipe less than 5 stars , unless they didn't follow instructions, or their taste buds are broken.  We used duck sauce, and jap jelly from our local farmers market for dipping sauce, but they are perfect without sauce.

I love this recipe! I made two changes which was on the batter ,  I mixed the egg and flour together then I breaded them. This helped with the bread crumbs sticking. And instead of frying them I baked them because I'm just trying to stay away from fried foods. But I will be making this again!!!

These turned pretty good. I honestly don't think these are your best bet for jalapeno poppers when compared to other options on this site, but if these sound good to you than give them a go. They require a lot of prep. and I'd recommend using real bacon, cooked and chopped up, instead of bacon bits which adds to the prep time. Everyone who tried these said they were great, but I've done the bacon wrapped, oven baked poppers before and they got a better reception and I think they were better overall. I would still recommend this recipe to anyone who wants some deep fried goodness as these were far from bad. It could just be personal preference.

Easy to make, don't fall apart in the fryer. I used cheddar cheese and skipped the bacon but added a little season salt and pepper to tget breadcrumbs.  Then fried them in olive/coconut oil. They turned out delicious!

I actually made these without bacon ( what's wrong with me?!) because I wanted to try the recipe as close to the original version that I remember from the 80s, made by Anchor Foods.  Delicious!  I like my peppers a little softer, so I chose to parboil them for two minutes. As for losing the filling while frying as one reviewer mentioned,cook the filling side down first and flip....you can see when the filling cracks and take it out of the pan before it oozes out.  I partially fried and froze the ones we didn't eat immediately, and will reheat them in the oven.  Another option I may try which I think Anchor also did was to use  mashed potato flakes instead of flour, I think they'll be crunchier.

Turned out bland. It was a good amount of work to make these, so I was very disappointed with how they turned out.  They looked great but the flavor did not pop, just bland.   I would recommend seasoned bread crumbs, real cheddar / mozzarella cheese mix and real bacon.

I make a huge batch of these every year with our crop of jalapenos.  Its a long process but worth every minute!  Once finished prep I freeze them single layer on wax paper.  When they are fully frozen they can be stored in freezer containers for a good length of time.  They can be baked from frozen but to be honest are best in the deep fryer.

Made this exactly to direction except we put the jalapenos back together after seeding and stuffing and before breading. They are delicious! Crunchy, creamy, spicy from the jalapenos, and mild from the cream cheese. We even froze a few and they reheated well in the microwave and kept most of the crunch, but next time, we will reheat in the dryer to keep more of the crispness of the crust. Overall, this is now a staple in our jalapeno cookbook!

Definitely blanch for a good 5 minutes prior.  Definitely use real bacon.  Definitely wear gloves.  I baked mine at 350 as well for about 30-40 minutes.  They freeze well, just reheat at 425 for about 20 minutes like another reviewer said.  They just get better over time.  Thank you for an awesome recipe!

Like others, I was a little disappointed to find that the "kick" of the popper came from the spices added to the cream cheese, and the jalapeno itself tasted like a regular cooked green pepper would -- a little bland. So, it was basically like tasting softened regular green pepper with a spiced-up, cheesy, cream cheese filling coated in fried, slightly bland bread crumbs. (I blanched the jalapenos for 30 seconds before filling them). Next time, I would add even more spice to the cream cheese to increase the flabour. All in all, while these were good, they took a long time to prep, with tons of dishes to wash afterward, and panic about accidentally having a jalapeno seed fly into an eye. For the result, I just don't think it was worth it. I might make these again if I'm really desperate for a party snack, in a few years.

These were awesome! I'm so glad I tried these. I've used the frozen kind in use past, but these were much better and surprisingly simple to make.  They were just a little time consuming, so I recommend making a lot and freezing the leftover ones to use in the future. The breading stayed on surprisingly well in our fryer with peanut oil.  For the stuffing, I used one package of cream cheese and about 3/4 of a package of shredded cheddar, and I had more than I needed to stuff 8 jalapeños, some of which I cut into quarters (the larger ones) to make bite-sized poppers.

I did a triple coat I mixed the crumbs and flour together for the first two coats then did a bread crumb coat. I used cooked bacon and some of the seeds in the filling, as they are actual spicy part of the pepper. I froze some I have to yet to cook but the deep fried ones were good. I'm going to bake the frozen ones

Jalepeno poppers are my son's favorite appetizer.  He and I did these together just as written and they really are the best ever. Letting them rest between coatings is the crucial step. Thanks to reviewers who suggested the freezing idea.  We are planning to do a mega batch for the holidays, freezing them once they are coated so we can pull them out and cook them as needed.

This recipe turned out amazing for me. I used pickled jalapeno peppers and only coated them once. I also used my deep fryer instead of a pan. VERY yummy with LOTS and lots of heat!

The only complaint that I have is that the peppers didn't cook through enough for me. Oh and It needed more shredded cheese. Also be sure to scale the recipe down if you have a smaller crowd. I easily stuffed about 50 halved peppers. I served this with a southwest dip.

I didn't care for this recipe. I followed everything to a key, except one thing. I was using my garden jalapenos. Which taste lovely. So I thought, "wow, I bet popper versions of this whole harvest would be great!"

So wrong. Firstly, the filling was way too salty. Secondly, it didn't taste good and I had extra afterwards. The breading wasn't sticking worth a !@#$ and was time consuming and much too much effort for the outcome. I am disappointed. Will not be making again.

They were alright, very easy to make but there really wasn't a lot of flavor.  I would honestly prefer to just cook something else with the jalapenos.

Like some of the other reviews after cutting the peppers in half and removing the seeds I bleached them in boiling water for a minute then placed in an ice bath. Dried them with paper towels before starting the whole process. Very time consuming but worth every minute. We freeze them once done then pack them up in bags of 12 each to keep frozen for football Sunday! The family loves them. The blanching of the jalapeño first makes the difference as sometimes in the frying process they didn't get cooked enough for our liking. Enjoy!

The first batch I made I used half a fresh pepper for each. Now, I like hot...but these were HOT! For the next batch, I divided the pepper into thirds. Much better. Don't be afraid to let them "rest" between coatings. A neat trick I never heard of but it works! Making them again real soon!!!!

July 2016.
Just as good as before! It is ESSENTIAL to allow resting/ drying times between coatings.

Delicious! I blanched the jalapenos prior to stuffing them. I put in a little pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika and cayenne to the mixture. I also added some of the seeds to the mixture to ensure it was spicy. I cooked them in the oven instead, at 425 for 15 minutes, turning them half way. Will definitely be prepping more to freeze them for later!

excellent!! I followed it almost exactly, just added a little panko bread crumbs to the regular bread crumbs. I didn't have a problem with just one coating, but I fried them in a deep fryer, they were nice and crispy and looked and tasted delicious. will definitely be making these again as I have lots of jalapeno peppers in my garden. Thank-you for the great recipe.

awesome!  I've made them a few times now and followed a few of the tips I found here:
*use a little bit of pepperjack cheese in place of cheddar
*parboil the jalepenos for about 2 min so they are a little softer
*tip from my brother that really works-rub hands with cooking oil prior to touching the peppers to prevent burning

While at the grocery store, I noticed that they had jalepeno cheddar cream cheese, so I used that!  It was so delicious!  All that I needed to buy was the cheeses and the jalepenos, and it was only about eight dollars!  When filling the halved peppers, I leveled the cheese mix, and ended up with some left over.  Should have used all of it!  Maybe next time I'll get some serrano peppers and put them into the cheese mixture for some extra spice.  Can't wait to make these again!

I used probably 1/4 cup of flour, 2+ cups of bread crumbs, and a little over a pound of jalepenos.

Good stuff. The Jalapeños from my garden are never very hot so I added Jalapeno powder to the filling. I rolled the filed peppers in flower and let them set as directed but put them in buttermilk and egg batter before the panko. They were perfect for us.

Loved this recipe. Very simple yet yummy. I used shredded cheddar and parmesan cheese. I did not have bacon bits at home so i fried the bacon and cut it into tiny bits. I just gave two coatings and it was good enough. My family loved it. Will try giving the third coat next time.

My husband loves these. I don't use bacon because I don't keep it in the house and I think it's a pain to make. What I did different in this recipe is to roast the jalapeños on the girl until the skin blistered, I then put them in a plastic bag and until cool then removed the skin and seeds without taking the veins out since we like spicy food. I then mixed the milk and an egg together, after the coating of flour, I mixed the milk mixture and remaining flour to make a batter. Once the peppers were coated in batter, I did a final coat of panko instead of bread crumbs for a crunchier breading. Can't get enough of these

I didn't have bacon on hand, but made these anyway.  The filling was very bland- not sure the bacon would have changed that much.  Also, I like my jalapenos cooked a bit more.  The poppers came out beautiful- looked delicious, but the jalapenos were the same as before they were cooked.  Thinking of blanching them next time and finding a good spice combination to add to the filling.

Really, really good and I cannot stand jalapenos normally. Followed the recipe to a T, and used Panko bread crumbs. Next time I might use montery jack cheese.

They weren't spicy! The cream cheese part was good, and the breading part was good, if a little bland, but if you are looking to satisfy your craving for the kind of jalapeno poppers you get when you're out to eat, keep looking! Maybe it would help to cook the jalapeno, and leave a few of the seeds in? My jalapenos were firm and nonspicy. My husband said they looked a little like chile rellenos, and I think they tasted more like that too. I'd put a little seasoning (and I used a seasoned bread crumb, but even more) in the breading part, and some salt, maybe. I know that would make them even less healthy with the deep frying, but no one ever says, "I know what we'll make for a healthy dinner - jalapeno poppers!"

Very easy and tastes great. My wife and I love the jalapeno peppers but my young girls don't so I did fried cheese balls. Same recipe just rolled cheese into quarter sized balls and followed same breading and frying process.

I'm glad I started on these last night for today's Super Bowl party. I made about 50 of them. The flour dip, dry, then bread crumb dip wasn't working out, so I mixed the breadcrumbs and milk together and battered them after the flour dry. I fell asleep while they were drying the second time (this was around midnight) and fried them in the morning and they came out good! I also seasoned the breadcrumbs a little bit before coating them as well as I made my bacon bits. Prep time was more like 90 minutes, and cook time about 15-20 minutes.

Wonderful recipe these were great at parties and just around the house. A little tip though if you want to add a Little heat to the poppers take some of the seeds from the jalapenos, 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon depending on your tolerance, and add it to the cream cheese before you stuff the peppers. it added just the right amount of heat which made it perfect. Again LOVE IT!!!

These were great!  Would def make them again.  My only change would be to put more bacon bits.  I used real bacon, not the fake type, but still I couldn't take the bacon.

I loved this dish. I used low fat cream cheese, reduced the cheddar by half, and made up the difference with pepper jack cheese. I added cooked chopped shrimp to the cheese. I blanched the peppers for 3 minutes as another viewer commented. The triple battering was a headache but we'll worth it. I will be adding this to my rotation.

Oh my goodness, these are the bomb!  I followed the directions exactly and they fried up so golden brown and crunchy with the soft cheeses inside.  No oozing as other recipes.  We dipped ours in raspberry jam and even my picky hubby said not to mess with this recipe, that I could make them again for sure!  Now that's high praise!

Ive made this these poppers a bunch of times.  All of the peppers were fresh out of my garden.  I have about a 100 of them sitting in my freezer waiting to be eaten.  I like serving them with a homemade tomato sauce.

I made these yesterday because I had a bag of jalapenos and no idea what to do with them. I omitted the bacon bits because I didn't have any, and used panko breadcrumbs and actual breadcrumbs that I made by baking bread and chopping up in a food processor. I fried them and served with ranch dressing, and everyone thought they were yummy. I made too many so I saved some to freeze. Not sure how they will taste once thawed, but the fresh ones were pretty tasty!

Will use breading technique in other recipes. These poppers are super, but adding a bit of seasoning to bread crumbs and flour helps out.

Awesome recipe! Time consuming but worth the effort. made about 40 poppers and froze half. I liked these baked much better than fried though. It was easier and no grease. cooked them for about 10-15 min in the oven. Tasty!

Everytime I make poppers, they turn out too crunchy. Next time ill blanche first as some reviewers have suggested. The filling is superb. 

Any suggestions for seasoning the bread crumbs??

Good but I thought these would be a bit more spicy.  I think I would only coat them twice next time.  I used panko bread crumbs which gave them a nice crunch.

These were great but we changed the batter to a batter we make for fried fish that contains cornstarch and Bisquick.  We used a pastry bag to fill the jalapenos - much easier than a spoon.  I would suggest preparing them ahead and freezing them so that the cream cheese center doesn't melt out of the popper in the cooking process.  The teenagers loved them!

Make sure you use the gloves. I thought I was a superstar and I didn't bother using them or a spoon to scoop out the seads. I used my hands and they have been burning hot for the last 6 hours. I have soaked my hands in milk, in cold water, used ice and even coated them with vaseline but that didn't work. On the bright side they were a hit. I used green onions and a whole jar of real bacon bits. I would add more shredded cheese next time to make them gooey

as someone who hates deep frying, i made modifications with this recipe after liking the taste from my first try (first try based on the exact recipe and steps). Used turkey bacon, cut the jalapeños in half and eliminated the flour. instead, i only dipped it with milk and panko italian style bread crumbs and baked it for 30-35 minutes. Not as crunchy as it is deep fired but tastes wise it is still excellent! ...and a lot healthier.

These are time consuming but well worth the wait. As I make them more and more (which I will), I bet it will take less time. Very easy recipe. I baked mine in the oven at about 375 until they become a little brown. Perfect! It is very hard to mess this recipe up. The only down side I found was that while slicing the peppers my skin was getting irritated-but that comes with cooking with peppers. Rinse hands often to keep from getting too uncomfortable. I was going to see how well they froze, but had none left to find out!

Delicious! I substituted ground sausage for the bacon and added cumin, sage and chili powder to the filling. I also switched the breadcrumbs for crushed Ritz crackers which I also added the above seasonings to. Absolutely yummy!

I started with this recipe and used some suggestions from other reviews and after a few batches, I think that I perfected this recipe. They came out much better when blanched first. I also stuffed the peppers with cream cheese, sharp cheddar cheese, pepper monterey jack cheese and parm cheese.  I didn't put the bacon bits in.  I also didn't coat them so many times because I didn't have time and I added crushed tostito chips to the panko crumbs after to give it a little crunch and then baked them at 350 until the cheese bubbled.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

This is a great recipe! I don't fry foods very often, but when I do, I will be making these again. I would experiment with different cheeses and maybe chop up a jalapeno into the cheese to give it more kick...or just use pepper jack cheese. These reheat wonderfully from frozen in the oven/toaster oven at 375 for about 10-15 minutes.

mine turned out VERY spicy - but really tasty (maybe the peppers here in Costa Rica are spicier since I used really fresh ones from the farmers market).  you really do need to do the 3 coatings.  And my peppers were a bit too crunchy - next time I will pre-cook them a bit to soften them.  But, on the whole, a really good, albeit spicy, recipe!

This was awesome. I had purchased the frozen ones from Sam's - they were tasteless. I used this recipe - what I did tweak was that I used triple cheddar cheese from Kraft and how I applied the bread crumb coating. After allowing them to sit with the flour on them for ten minutes, I poured some bread crumbs in a large zip-loc bag, rolled the poppers again in the milk,  then carefully placed them in the bag - 5 at a time, mixing them, leaving them in there and placing 5 at a time more, adding bread crumbs, and mixing, this continued for a bit. Each popper came out nice and coated and ready for the frying pan. I dip them in Smuckers Raspberry Jam, and WOW!

Not a good recipe... As other reviewers said, these poppers were so bland and definitely NOT worth the work, time, or calories (I'm health conscious, not a health food snob).  This was my first time trying to fry anything other than a turkey, and it was a bust.  The breading burned before 2 minutes and the peppers were still very crunchy.  The dark brown color and the shape of these poppers made them look like turds (sorry).  I could barely bring myself to even try one after I made them.  I'm giving this recipe 2 stars because I'm giving the benefit of the doubt with my frying inexperience.

I have made this recipe a number of times and it is a HUGE hit!  It has just the right amount of heat.  

I've also added some finely chopped red bell pepper to the filling.  Adds a little extra mmmmm.

It was after midnight and I had a snack craving so I made them up but didn't bread or cook them.  I just ate them raw.  MMMMM!

I tried the recipe to a tee and when I went to eat one, the jalapeno's were not cooked.  They were golden brown but not tender.  I had a thermometer in the oil to check the temperature which was 365 degress exactly.  I then put them in the oven to bake for another 20 minutes and they still were not tender.  Did I just get a bad batch of jalapeno's?  Also they weren't very spicy for me so will need to add some additional spices to punch up the flavor with salt, etc. So sorry!

These jalapeno poppers were pretty good, but the process of making them was extremely time consuming. There are are similar recipes (that are not fried) that are even tastier, but much easier to make! I won't be making these again.

We tried this last night and I followed the recipe exactly.  They were gobbled up instantly.  Everyone wants more!  Even my kids loved them.  The only complaint was that they were not spicy enough.  Perfectly crispy.  Wonderful.  May try baking them and adding natural sausage with or in place of bacon bits.  Normally, we don't care for cream cheese filled jalapenos, but these really were worth the effort. Would be nice to fry some, freeze them, and bake them later, but will be tough to have extras.  They are that delicious!  May never go back to frozen store bought ones again.

I made these last night and they were awesome.  My 10 year old went crazy for them, and my husband asked me to make them as an appetizer for Christmas.  I followed the recipe except I used tempura to coat them in because I was out of bread crumbs, and I omitted the bacon because I was making a bacon pasta as well.  Still turned out amazing.

I love this recipe. It was very popular with everyone in the house. I did two things a little different. I double coated the peppers with the bread crumbs to make them crispier. I fryed them a little longer pepper side down to make the peppers a little softer. I will be making these for family functions alot.

Totally loved it. They came out perfect! Next time we will chop up the peppers and mix them into the cream cheese to kill some of the sting. Had a lot of party goers bee lining for the water. Otherwise, very tasty.

This is a good recipe, but I made some alterations.
Substitutions: Real bacon, seasoned batter for bread crumbs, and grated asiago cheese.
Additions: Mrs. Dash seasoning to taste.
I'd love to know what people think of this variation.

Exceptionally good!! Makes an extra amount of stuffing, so you can decrease the amount, or buy more peppers.

These are delicious! We baked half of them at 425* and fried half of them and both turned out wonderfully! We will definitely be making these again!
Also, we used panko bread crumbs and even the baked ones had a super crispy crust on them!

Love this recipe! I omit the cheddar cheese and the bacon and instead of frying I put them in the oven for about 45 minutes at 375 (flipping them periodically). Definitely make sure to wear gloves when de-seeding the jalapenos.

This was a very easy recipe, and would cook them again, and again. I used the extra cream cheese mixture in my Chicken Enchilada recipe as we had enough for the sauce mixture after we made the poppers. Chasity from WA

This is a great recipe.  I omitted the bacon to make the poppers vegetarian, and baked in the oven at 375 degrees for 45 minutes.  They turned out crispy and toasty and delicious.  Great party recipe!

Very time consuming. Best have at least 1 hour just for these. The first time I have worked with Jalapeno's. My first bite was HOT. My family loved them and I put them in the freezer after frying. Will try to bake them the next time.

Love this recipe!  May mess it up next time because I want to cook up my own bacon, and use pepper jack cheese.  I f it doesn't taste as good, I will gladly use as written again!  Thanks for sharing this one.  It's winner.  :)

Very good!  I followed some suggestions on reviews.  I added some chipotle pepper powder in the cheese mixture.  I also added a little salt and onion powder in the bread crumbs.  To save on calories, I baked them for 15 minutes at 400 degrees.

These are amazing!! I have made them many times now and they disappear faster than I can make them!! I also prefer to bake them rather than fry, however I do give them a quick browning in hot oil first them transfer them to the baking sheet. Less greasy, yet just as delicious!! Thanks for the recipe :-)

I make these all of the time and everybody LOVES them. Here are a couple pointers. After halfing and deseeding, blanch the peppers in boiling water for 2 minutes and let dry before filling. If you want the poppers a little spicier, add some seeds to the filling.  Triple dipping these are a MUST. Once in flour, twice in bread crumbs. And I use fresh bread crumbs. They give them a little more texture and a good crunch.  Enjoy!!

I have to give this a 4, because I don't deep-fry anything.  I give them a blast with "butter spray" (Pam), then put them in the convection oven for about 15 minutes.  
These are GREAT when served with something sweet for dipping.  I can my own plum sauce, so thats what we use.  
Other than the deep-frying issue... these deserve a 5 star rating.  EVERY TIME!!

I made these for a get together my family had at church and they turned out AWESOME! I've had those frozen poppers before and liked them so decided to make my own. These are sooooo tasty and not spicy either. some peppers were a little hotter than others but for the most part the heat was not an issue. one word of advice though WEAR GLOVES when de seeding the peppers. my fingers were burnning like crazy afterwards. I knew better but was too much in a hurry and ended up paying the price. WEAR GLOVES. but enjoy. This recipe is well worth the effort for any occasion

I added extra Cheddar the second time I made them because I thought they were a little too cream cheesy. The crust is great and LOVE the combo. I make them than freeze them to cook later!

I liked these alot, but they are time consuming.  I added a cup of Bacon Bits instead of a tablespoon, and I added Hickory seasoning.  Then I baked them for 25 minutes at 375.

oh my goodness.  these are a little labor intensive but boy are they worth it.  first let me say, like she says, wear the gloves.  just do it.  I mixed 8 ounces of cream cheese, and 8 ounces of fresh grated sharp cheddar.  I used fresh cooked bacon - large pieces and mixed in some smoked paprika for that smokey flavor.  these were AWESOME.  will be making these again and again.

Yummy, I added finely diced onions and garlic to the filling. I also added some of a ranch dip seasoning packet to the flour. I used a mix of panko and garlic bread crumbs for the breading. I blanched the peppers for 2 minutes and deviened them but kept most of the seeds in. I can take a lot of heat but they were too hot for me lol I will take a bit more seeds out next time. Very good I dipped them in my friends homemade strawberry jam... and then drank some milk to cool off. :) Oh and I cooked thick cut bacon for the bacon bits.

holy smokes this is a great little recipe. i decided to plant a few jalapeno plants a few years ago and have made them with this recipe every time.

the only thing i do differently is coat them twice in flour, and twice in the breadcrumbs, letting them dry in between. the whole process is a lot of work,  but well worth it.

I would like to make this...is there a way they could be baked instead of deep fried?  I love jalapeno poppers and this sounds like a wonderful recipe...especially being dipped in bread crumbs more than once...thank you for a great popper recipe.

I made these for the first time today and thought they were great.  I used jalapenos from my garden, which makes it alittle more special.  I also used 4 strips of bacon that I cooked and crumbled.  My husband loved them.  I will be using this recipe again!!

I left out the bacon (none on hand but will add next time I make them) and mold the cheese mixture into a dome-like shape over the pepper half....they kind of looked like little eggs. I then froze them in a freezer bag single layer and put this on a plate in the freezer until frozen. I fried them the next evening for guests and everyone raved about them...none left. One person said they wouldn't mind a bag of them in their Christmas goodie bag I give out. I used fresh jalapenos from my garden and added a little onion powder and garlic powder. My husband is English and has never had a popper before, but loves them now! I will definitely be making more for the freezer as I have many peppers to use.

Maybe I'm in error here.  While I did blanch my peppers for two minutes, that shouldn't have made the breading fall off!  I waited well over ten minutes between each coat, did the flour once and the bread crumbs twice.  Just pulled these guys out of the fryer and their breading is just flaking right off.  The flavor is also a little mild for me, despite having used both cheddar and monterey jack, and oodles more bacon.  However, I did find that using a ziplock bag to pipe the cheese mixture into the peppers made that part a snap.

These were delicious!  I made them for a bridal shower and they went flying off the plate.  I took some other reviewers advice and added pepper and garlic salt to the flour mixture and used pepperjack cheese.  I used a tiny handful of seeds to ensure they would have a little "kick".  We used a deep fryer, which made them absolutely delicious.  Will be making this again and again!

Made these for my family. They loved them. The jalapenos were exceptionally hot last year from the garden, but they gobbled them down any way and praised the taste. They really are the 'Best Ever Jalapeno Poppers'.

Although these do involve a good deal of work, they really are the best jalapeno poppers!  They also freeze well, so you can make a large batch and enjoy them at other times.

OMG!!! I loved these!!!! I always buy them at Jack in the Box! & they're pretty pricy. So I decided to look for a recipe to make them myself. I have to say they taste exactly like the ones at Jacks. I used Monterey Jack Cheese because its my favorite. My husband had never had  Jalapeno Poppers and he LOVED them! Ate almost all of them! These are always being made right before we have movie night as a snack.!! Great recipe!

I LOVE THESE AND THIS RECIPE!! I did however use buttermilk instead of regular milk and added crab meat and tiny shrimp to the mixture.  After reading a previous review I took the advice of blanching the jalapenos before dipping and that made a HUGE difference!  Thanks for the recipe, HLSANDS!!!

Super! Super!  I did blanch my peppers and I did leave a few seeds for some heat....Used fat free Cream Cheese with a pinch of basil, parsley and garlic powder for my taste. I also used Honey Bunches of Oats with Almonds cereal instead of bread crumbs.  The crushed up cereal adds just enough "sweet" for the "heat".

This was much more of a hassle than it was worth. The jalapenos were crunchy though the filling was good. I had a problem with the egg turning the bread crumbs into an undippable mush about half way through each series of dipping. I ended up using a lot more bread crumbs than the recipe called for. Next time I will just buy them from the store

These were a total hit! Brought them to a work event and I heard "That was the best jalapeno popper I've ever had" more than a few times.  I used sharp cheddar and cream cheese, but used 12 oz Cheddar to 8 oz cream cheese.  Triple breading them is worth it.

Started with FRESH peppers from my garden, folllowed the recipe to the tee. Very light and put those frozen ones to SHAME! Don't need to blanch your peppers if their fresh! Con: takes longer than any 45 minutes but still well worth it!

Pretty good base recipe, but I found them to be a bit bland. I think I will try again and use jack cheese instead of cheddar and maybe season the bread crumbs a bit more.

My first time making anything like this, they were delicious and work well freezing them. I used fresh grown jalepenos, and for bacon bits I chopped up baco's real fine they were wonderful, and I will be reusing this recipe.

These are absolutely awesome.  I will definitely make again.  Three coating process is worth the time.  I added garlic powder and Cajun seasoning to the flour.  I added some of the ribs and seeds to the cheese mixture for heat.  Fantastic

Excellent recipe - much cheaper and better than store and restaurant bought poppers.  The only changes I made were adding seasoning to the flour and breadcrumbs (garlic powder esp) and I steamed the peppers first for a couple minutes.  They turned out way too hot for me but everyone raved and raved.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was in instant hit! My only complaint is that I wish it was spicey (this reciepe is very mild). I've tried variations to make it spicier but haven't been able to come up with the perfect mix so I decided, why mess with a good thing and just stick to the reciepe from now on.

These were very good however - having never used Jalapeño's before I didn't read as far as wear gloves. make sure you wear gloves - my hands were on fire for 5 hours! My company loved them but I couldn't enjoy them.

You definitely do not want the temperature of your oil too hot. Luckily I tested one first. I also substituted the flour for nutritional yeast (I'm moving and wasn't going to buy a new bag of flour.)

Before this I'd only ever had the cream cheese filled poppers.  This was a nice change!

Searched for a good recipe and being that these were the "Best Ever" I thought I'd try them.  They're really good, but do have to agree with the others about them needing a little more flavor.  Maybe seasoned breadcrumbs.  I may try to bake them because most of my breading came off while frying.  And the jalapenos were very crunchy...a little too raw for my taste, maybe the baking will help with that too.  But all in all, pretty yummy!!

As good as take out. I double coated the poppers in the bread crumbs for better coverage, and put six strips of fresh cooked crumbled bacon into the cheese mixture instead of bacon bits. Absolutely delicious!!!

Blanching the peppers is a GREAT tip!  For those of you who like a little more heat, I suggest using older jalapenos rather than fresh off the vine.  We grow several varieties of our own peppers, and have found that jalapenos and poblanos that are picked and sit in the fridge drawer a week are much hotter than fresh picked.  Or, choose peppers that are turning orange, they are older and more picante!  BTW, Poblanos are an excellent substitute, milder in flavor and heat, but can still pack a punch!  Great recipe!

For those who don't like cream cheese (like my boyfriend) you can substitute for 12 oz. of velvetta cheese softened to room temp and follow the rest of the recipe exactly. Also, flash freezing in the freezer to harden them up a bit before frying is a good idea. Perfection!

Made these for a Superbowl party and they went FAST.  Baked instead of fried.  Added jalapeno cheddar and regular cheddar for more taste.  Also used Panko breadcrumbs for a crispier outside

I made these for a super bowl party and they were gone within 30 minutes!  Delicious!  However, I added some seasoning to the breading to give it a little more flavor; I added some garlic powder, salt & pepper, and adobo seasoning, just because. I think I'm going to bake them next time, instead of frying them, however.  But wonderful recipe! (:

Gave this recipe a try for the big game this weekend. What a hit!!! The poppers were really easy and fast to make despite the drying time. (I think that really makes a difference so don't skip it). I also replaced the milk with buttermilk which added just a bit more flavor and allowed the coating to stick better. Having a gas stovetop, the cooking time took less than 2 minutes. You should definitely give this one a whirl. Great recipe, thanks!

These Jalapeno peppers were just okay. They did not have much flavor to them. It was a bit disapointing after all the the time they took to make. Not sure if I will make again.

I was so excited to come across this recipe as I love poppers and thought they would be far too difficult to make but it was actually pretty easy. It did take a long time but was so worth it. I left out the bacon and added some dried herbs to the breadcrumbs and they were amazing. Thank you for sharing this recipe. I will definitely be making these again!

YUM!  These were sooo delicious.  I would've given a 5 but I looked through the reviews and realized I shouldve blanched the peppers slightly before stuffing, otherwise, it wouldve been a 5!  I added some garlic powder and more bacon, and also added some mozzerella cheese I had on hand.  Turned out wonderful!

These turned out well... I followed a couple of the reviews and baked instead of fried - I think they would have been better fried.  Since I baked them, the bread crumbs didn't stick very well.  I froze the leftovers and heated them up in the microwave as a "late night snack"  a couple weeks later and they were still great.  I prefer my poppers to be a bit spicier, so I too followed some of the previous review and threw some of the seeds into the filling.  I had some of those fake bacon bits in my pantry, so I used them instead of real bacon... next time I will definitely use real bacon, or maybe just omit the bacon all together.  I also used pepperjack cheese to add a little extra flavor.

Not the typical jalapeno taste - much sweeter.  The thought of jalapeno peppers made me nervous.  Easier to make than I thought and much tastier.  Thanks for the tip about the gloves.

Guests LOVED these!  Suggestions: Wear gloves when seeding peppers!  Blanch Peppers for 2-3 min.  Add few seeds to cheese mixture otherwise these are far too mild!  Coated peppers w/bread crumbs 3 times: seasoned, unseasoned, then panko bread crumbs.  Time consuming but...  MMmmm good!  Will try to freeze leftovers then bake @ 350 until bubbly (approx 15min) for next time.

Great recipe....making more then you need and freezing them is wise since it does take a while to make,but so worth it. Instead of using canned or jarred jalapenos, use fresh. The spice and flavor is soooo much better. Omit the bacon for vegetarians.

These truly are the BEST EVER jalapeno poppers. I make them in double or triple batches using jalapenos from our garden and then freeze them. We enjoy them all year long this way. I have also used various other peppers so that they would be a little hotter.

These are awesome.  We couldn't stop eating them! Delicious served with The Pampered Chef's Raspberry Habanero Sauce.   I made as directed, but added more bacon to filling. Instead of halving the peppers, I cut off the stem and top,  took out the seeds and membranes with The Core and More tool from Pampered Chef, then filled them using a baby spoon.  I used a mixture of my own dried bread crumbs and Japanese Panko crumbs to dip them in.  It does take more crumbs to coat than stated, and very time-consuming, but SO worth it! I deep-fried the poppers and ate some immediately, then froze some for later and baked at 400 for 10 mins.  Both turned out very crunchy.  When I first filled and coated the poppers, I put in fridge since I didn't have time to fry them up that night.  They were in the fridge covered in plastic wrap for about 4 days until I fried them, and they turned out fine.  I used about 50 peppers, & still had a small cup of filling left-over, which is great as a spread for crackers.  Raspberry Habanero Sauce and The Core and More can be found at www.pamperedchef.biz/christinefrieden .

I used Hungarian peppers and they turned out great. I did add seasoning to the flour, breadcrumbs and the cheese mix which made them 5 star. The triple breading is time consuming but well worth it. People couldn't believe they were hand made.

I don't eat hot peppers but hubby and daughter said FIVE STARS for sure!!  Hubby said could have been a little hotter so next time will use pepper jack cheese to spice it up a little more.  Other than that...perfect!

Amazing! Yummo, remember to wear gloves when handling jalapenos, and I ran out of bread crumbs halfway through so I used cornmeal and they turned out just as good. Thanks!!!

just finished making for first batch of 100. I don't really care for poppers but these are excellent, even I ate several. I made 50 with pepper jack cheese and 50 with cheddar cheese. tomorrow I will make 50 with bleu cheese. The guys were eating them as fast as I could make them for freezing. Perfect recipe. thanks so much.

Amazing! Not too labor intensive, just a matter of waiting in between coatings. I had banana peppers that had cross-pollinated with habaneros, plus habaneros, so used a combination of them. Used a mixture of Mozzarella, Monterey Jack and Bleu Cheese in the filling. Used a total of 13 peppers, and took the resulting 26 poppers to the pool to share. Rave reviews! Definitely making these again :)

I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and I thought they were great. We wil definitely make again but next time I will wear gloves. I have never had a reaction to jalapeno's before but my hand felt like it was on fire after I had made them.

Time consuming? Worth it. Kind of a hassle, but it works. Delicious, can be used on any fried food. I registered just to say how good this is! The waiting time between steps is CRUCIAL. When dealing w/ less delicate foods, you can skip the last (3rd) step, and just do the flour + bread crumbs 1 x a piece.

If you love poppers as I do, this recipe is for you!. I followed the recipe but on the 3rd coating I used panko plain bread crumbs instead of flour. I also made them the night before cooking and stored the stuffed coated poppers in the fridge over night. The next day I deep fried them for 4 minutes in my Rival Deep Fryer (8-10 at a time), and they came out restaurant grade perfect! Now I need to experiment with the filling. Thank You for this most wonderful recipe!

I had all of the ingredients besides bread crumbs so I crushed some French's Friend Onions and used those as my coating. I'm sure regular dry bread crumbs would have been fine but the fried onions were awesome! I didn't have enough to coat for the second time so some poppers came out with missing breading spots. I only made these for my family so asthethic value didn't matter so much this time. I added a little bit of colby jack cheese for added flavor too.  I also decided to freeze some leftover poppers after frying.   This recipe definately makes the best ever jalapeno poppers!

Very good, however time-consuming. They do freeze well however, so your best bet is to prep as many as possible at once and fry them up as needed.  Would like to try this using beer in place of the milk next time.

These were SO tasty!! I ended up omitting and used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I added a little bit more flour and bread crumbs so I would only have to dip and coat from each bowl once. My face was on fire after eating them, but so worth it!!!

the best recipe i've tried yet. my coating didnt stay completely, but still the best than any. I cant imagine that others were adding heat to their recipes because my jalapenos were hot!! I did not use bacon, but probably will the next time around. Thanks for the recipe!

This was great. I didn't have the bacon and I forgot the breadcrumbs which would have helped having a thicker crust for the poppers but overall, it was good. I will make again! Thanks.

We made this dish for a party.  We made the night before and reheated in the oven at the party.  We used pepper jack cheese instead and it gave quite a nice kick.  The tripple breading is time consuming but worth it!!

Very good flavor and texture. I used 8 ounces of cream cheese for 12 ounces of jalapenos; it was just enough. Added Parmesan cheese and spices to the cream cheese, and to the bread crumbs.  Also replaced some of the cheddar cheese with mozzarella. This was a huge pain to make, but it was worth it.

Thank you for this recipe. I used Ranch dressing instead of cream cheese, a handful of shredded cheddar cheese, a pinch of garlic salt, dip in egg and then bread them. Baked them for 20-30 min. Turned out perfect. They were gone fast!

Great popper recipe.  I was afraid that their would be a lack of heat so what I did was I added 1ts of cayenne pepper to the cheese mix and I added 2 ts to the bacon while cooking it.  In addition, I added 1/2 the seeds of 1 jalapeno to the cheese mix.  Everyone loved them.  Time consuming, very.  But worth it.

I halved the recipe, and ended up with about 50 poppers.  It's a bit time-consuming, but well worth the effort.  There's no way frozen commercial product compares to the taste of a pepper that was just picked hours before cooking.  Next time, I'll add something to the filling for a bit more kick.

At the end of the growing season I have tons of Jalapenos left and now I have the perfect recipe for them!  The only change I made was to add a pinch of garlic powder, cilantro and a little paprika. When I made these last, I froze them before frying!  Then I put them into freezer bags.  They turned out fantastic.  The guys just grab a few and fry them.  Quick easy snack, I hope they last the winter!

I had to register just so I could review this recipe - It is great! this is the second time I have made them and they do not last! The only change I would make is if you like a little more heat (not much at all if you clean them out good), I would leave some of the membranes in. the heat is in the membranes and seeds. I'm going to make some for the freezer also for a quick appetizer or snack.

Has anyone tried making these with pickled peppers (from the can or jar) instead of raw ones?  I think that it would replace the need for blanching and would add the heat and flavor some of us say were missing. I'm going to try that next time and post the results.  Great recipe!

Awesome recipe!!!!!!!! I tried mixing things up a bit instead of using the bacon bits I bought some cooked salad shrimp and put in in the food processor for a few seconds to chop them up then added the chedder and cream cheese I also added some garlic powder ohhh these were so yummy! But because of the texture of the shrimp before dipping them at all I let them sit in the fridge for about 20 min to set try them they are AWESOME

Simply delicious!!! This was my first time making poppers. I usually buy them already prepared. After planting jalapeno this year in my garden, I decided to try making my own poppers. They were absolutely delicious. This is the first recipe that I loved without making any modifications. I did however deep fry them at a lower temperature, to ensure that they did not cook too fast. The peppers we used were so hot, we had to eat them with cooling reinforcements (milk & bread) nearby. All of my family loved them. The batter was the best.

Great poppers.  I used reduced fat cream cheese and baked them to make them a little lighter.

Awesome recipe. Used our home grown Jalapenos and they were superb! This is a welcome addition to my collection! I added about a tablespoon of sour cream to the stuffing mixture, and corn meal to the breading. The recipe takes a bit of time, but is well worth it!

These were delicious and fairly easy, though they did take a lot of time. I had to scale the quantities way down because I only had eight or nine jalapenos from my garden and this recipe is obviously intended for a much bigger crowd than just my husband and myself, but we really enjoyed them. I will be making these again just as soon as I have more mature peppers on hand.

Wonderful flavor! I used fresh jalapenos from our garden and I fully agree that the triple breading is worth a little extra effort.

First time making Jalapeno Poppers.  They turned out great!  I highly recommend making your own bacon and using the oil (as well as some more) to fry them.  I also used small jalapenos and carefully took out the insides and stuffed them. Some of the larger ones I cut in half and filled. They didn't look as nice as the others.  Over all I think that coating them three times is what made the difference.

Crumbling up the bacon in the stuffing seems to be quicker than wrapping the poppers in bacon then baking,but the wrapped version seems to retain stuffing in case of overflow/bursting. Either way, awesome!!

This recipe is pretty fabulous.  Maybe i had abnormally small jalapenos or something, but i decided to not use that much cream cheese and cheddar for the recipe and i still had a little extra.  The breading was fantastic, perfect and crispy. I also just added a little salt and left out the bacon and they still tasted great.

the breading and jalapenos were great, and the filling had the right consistency, but no flavor whatsoever. even so, they were delicious when dipped in ranch dressing. will definitely cook these again, but i will make sure to spice up the filling better next time.

This recipe was a big hit for my Super Bowl party! The only changes I made was using real bacon instead of bacon bites, next time I will add even more. I put them in the freezer for about 10 minutes before frying. After frying I sprinkled with a little salt. I will definately make this recipe again...Thanks for sharing!

This is the best popper recipe I've found and well worth the extra effort and time.  Definitely make a huge batch and freeze the extras (don't forget the gloves).  Just as great the second and third time around.  They never last long in our house.

I disagree with anyone who says these were bland. Of course the spice of the jalapeños depends on the beginning heat of your jalapeños. Removing the seeds does not effect the heat as the spice is in the membranes. Ours were quite hot. I used cream cheese, half cheddar and half Monterey jack cheese as well as bacon as the recipe called for to stuff ours. So good!! The crust was crisp and delicious! I did blanche my peppers for two minutes in boiling water once they were halved and cleaned.  The steps it takes to make them are totally worth it. Better than any you can find in a restaurant.

A simple recipe that was loved by all.  It is time consuming to do it properly - but worth the wait. Use rubber gloves when handling the peppers - especially if you have sensitive skin.

Wherever I go I order Jalapeno Poppers and these are by far the best I have ever had.  I suggest using fresh jalapenos and I prefer to dip them in ranch dressing.  It is excellent.  The recipe is incredible and I'd recommend it to anyone!

This is an awsome recipe for Jalapeno Poppers.  I did add some seasoning salt to the bread crumbs to give the coating a little extra taste.  My husband took some to work and now his coworkers want to pay me to make them.

These were excellent!  I didn't have cream cheese so I traded out with little individual soft swiss cheese wedges that come in a circle package (cow w/bell on it).  Everyone loved them.

Not easy to make, so I will make larger batch next time & freeze.  Well worth the work!

These are a ton of work, but worth every minute.  I blanched the peppers for 3 minutes prior to filling.  I also wound up doubling the flour/bread crumb mixture.  I cooked the bacon first, and added quite a bit more of it.  Otherwise, followed the recipe to the "T".  I did wind up freezing about half of the uncooked poppers for another day.  We'll see how they do thawed and cooked.

So I made these with fresh Jalapeno's from someone's garden on Halloween night. My first mistake was when I boiled them my whole family started choking from the aroma, my mother in law walked in with my neice and they started choking as well, so I prepared them but was then scared to cook them, I didn't want to kill anyone after making them choke to death, so I didn't cook them tell after they left. After all that they ended up being pretty good, not worth the time though, I will just by them next time.

I have made these a few times for family gatherings and everyone loves them.  The only thing I change is I use green onions instead of bacon.  They freeze great too.  I also use gloves when handling the peppers as they burn my fingers.

These were good, but I think i needed to boil the peppers longer because they still seemed too tough when you bit into them. They really do take a long time, but it is worth it- just to have your own homemade jalapeno poppers!

This is by far the best jalapeno poppers I have ever made.  It takes time to prepare them, but they are definatly worth the wait!!  My out of town company always ask for them!! They're a hit!!

These were excellent! Everyone loved them (even me and I don't like poppers)I used alot more bacon than said but besides that they were perfect...I put them in my home fryer and they came out just perfect. It's a little time consuming but well worth it for the end result. I can't wait until we get more jalapenos out of the garden so I can make more!

They were really good, but they were also a lot of work. My only suggestion is to let the creamcheese mixture sit for a while to let the flavors mix. I also substituted pepperjack for some of the chedder. They diffinetly needed the second dredging of milk/breadcrumbs, so don't skip that step. I will probably make them again, but next time I think I'll bake them; it was a lot of oil.

These are really good. My spicy lovers love them. They do take a little while to make. The only suggestion I can make is to wear gloves while handling the jalapenos. My hand felt like it was on fire for about six hours. It was the worse pain ever! The poppers were worth it.

This recipe got many postive comments and requests for the recipes. Two things I will change the next time I make these. I thought the flavor was a little bland and I would use a Mexican blend cheese instead of the cheddar cheese and add more bacon bits or use real bacon.

These turned out great.  I didnt add any bacon bits or as much cheddar cheese as it calls for but it still turned out.  I made them for my dad that loves the deli ones and he was talking about how much better these ones taste.

These are really good and reheat well in the oven.  They are somewhat time consuming so making a big batch is a great suggestion.

Though the snacks were tasty, most of the cheese ran out onto the pan.  I won't use this recipe in the future.
