I made this for my family tonight. It was good but the rice was a little soggy. I might cook the rice on its own next time and then mix together with the chicken/veggie mix.

I changed a few things and this has now become one of my favorite meals!!

-double or triple the amount of garlic
-use EVOO instead of butter
-use 3 tbsp of lemon juice, no lemon peel
-use frozen peas instead of broccoli
-use 2 tbsp of instant mashed potatoes instead of cornstarch (trust me on this one, weird, but oh so good!)
-MOST IMPORTANT--add 2-3 tbsp of Thai sweet red chili sauce at the end of cooking

Trust me, the Thai sweet red chili sauce adds hotness and an immense amount of flavor!  Is was sooooooo good!

This was quite delicious. I cooked the rice separate, using the chicken broth and lemon juice instead of water and wow what a difference that makes! I'm not a master of cooking chicken on the stovetop so it was a little dry, probably due to my fear of undercooking it and not cooking it with the rice and broth. But yummy nonetheless, and I'll definately make it again!

I found this recipe years ago on the box of Minute Rice. It calls for peapods instead of the broccoli. My kids really love the peapods. Nice variation from the broccoli.

Followed JJR’s advice and cooked the rice (I used Basmati) separately – then added to the chicken mixture.  I used EVOO in place of butter or margarine.   I added about 1tsp. finely chopped fresh rosemary (I didn’t have any fresh parley) to the chopped onion and carrots – allowing them to sauté for approx. 3-4 minutes before adding chicken pieces.  This was a pretty quick and very good recipe.

I followed several of other reviewers' suggestions and it paid off.  I used the juice of two large lemons and the grated peel of one whole lemon.  Cooking the rice separately and adding at the end is also a good suggestion. The garlic needs to be doubled, as well.  When I make this again, I will probably steam 4 large diced celery stalks and add with the other vegetables.  The family loved it because it has such a fresh, light taste.  Very good for my husband who is diabetic.

This is really great. The pairing of lemon and garlic with rice and chicken is so good. I did add more lemon juice and more garlic. I like a flavorful dish. I also add a bit of sea salt before letting it simmer. Keep the rest the same!

Very good. Because of previous reviews, I added extra lemon juice and extra garlic. Also, I used quinoa instead of rice. Turned out excellent... my picky husband ate a big bowl.

This recipe was beyond bland, and the chicken turned out dry. I thought about tweaking it the next time I make it, but I can't bring myself to make there be a next time.

From what I remember, I found it to be a little dry.  I guess I don't care for lemon and chicken together.

Made this today for the first time and it was a hit! Totally gone at the end of dinner too. The only thing I changed is instead of using regular instant rice, I put in a pouch of Lipton Chicken flavored rice and it added a lot of flavor to the dish. Definitely one I'll make again per the requests from the family.

I MADE THIS LAST NIGHT.  AS WRITTEN, IT WAS TASTELESS.  BECAUSE THERE ARE JUST THE TWO OF US, I CUT THE RECIPE IN HALF. I FOUND I STILL HAD TO ADD THE WHOLE CAN OF CHICKEN BROTH, OR THE RICE WOULD HAVE  BEEN CRUNCHY.  LIKE OTHERS I HAD TO ADD MORE GARLIC, A PINCH OF CHINESE FIVE SPICE AND ALSO ADDED  2 PACKETS OF TRUE LIME CRYSTALS AND SOME LITE SOY SAUCE. I THINK IF I MAKE IT AGAIN, I WILL ADD SOME  RED AND GREEN  BELL PEPPERS. I WOULD ALSO USE PRE-COOKED MINUTE RICE INSTEAD OF UNCOOKED INSTANT RICE.

My husband like it, I thought it was okay... Needed a lot of salt and pepper to wake up the flavor.  I cooked brown rice ahead of time because I just can't stand instant rice.

This was awful.  Completely lacked flavor.  I had to add a ton of soy sauce just to eat it.  I will not be making this again.

Tasty!  I left out the rice and served it over medium egg noodles.  Used flour instead of cornstarch.  Nice change from my usual fare.  Thanx!

This recipe was easy to make and had an incredible flavor. Very mild but nice. I did not make any changes and my fiance and I gobbled it up.

I thought this was a fairly good recipe. I am usaully not a fan of chicken and rice recipes, but this was very flavorful and not mushy or bland at all.

This was a decent backbone recipe.  I liked it because it was healthy and low-fat.  I modifed it by adding 3 garlic cloves, 3 carrot, roughly 2 cups of broccoli, adding rosemary, pepper and used brown instant rice.  I didn't adjust the liquid for the brown rice and the rice turned out well.
