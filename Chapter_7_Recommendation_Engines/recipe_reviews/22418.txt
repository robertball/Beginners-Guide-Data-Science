Something is missing in this recipe - it doesn't have the "umph" that I would suspect from a focaccia.  I am going to try adding the seasoning to the actual bread rather than on top.  I would suggest maybe substituting Italian seasoning for the basil and thyme.  Rather than greasing up a pan, try throwing down some corn meal.  This recipe seems to work well with fresh veggie's on top as well (try adding sliced onions and mozzarella over the top!)

I was disappointed by this recipe.  I had hoped it would be much better than it was.  I however do think I will try it again as it has the potential to be great with a little work.  

First, 1 tablespoon of sea salt on the top is WAY too much.  I would cut this dramatically.  Second, I purchased a new non-stick cookie sheet to make this.  I feat part of the problem may have been my pan as everything I have cooked on it to date has come out overdone or burnt on the bottom.  The final issue I had was the bread itself was dry.  I think part of this may have been due to the cookie sheet.  The top of the bread, after you knocked most of the salt off did have good flavor though.  I will make this again as I have tomatoes left over I need to use.  I am hoping once I make a second attempt I can work the kinks out.

very nicely flavored-I would add a little more yeast & let it rise a little more as we like a lighter bread

Not happy with this at all. It was the first time I had ever made Focaccia and this recipe sounded good. (I do make regular homemade bread quite a bit)This came out very dry and not very flavorful.

The recipes was poorly written. The recipe did not allow for the necessary amount of time for the dough to rise, especially the first rise. The combination of ingredients leaves something lacking as well.
