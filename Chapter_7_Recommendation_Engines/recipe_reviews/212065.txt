I do not agree with the first review.  I thought this was great!  We had it for Thanksgiving and even people who do not like stuffing liked this.  I used Spicy Italion Sausage and amped up the spices.  My Italion bread only cost $1.28!! (LOL)

Really liked this stuffing.  Moist, but not gooshy.  We did use a full pound of 'breakfast'-type sausage, with a couple of shakes of sage instead of all the fresh sage and chicken stock instead of water.

Followed to a tee and not for me.  Do not like the pork/chicken combo.  Salty from the pork sausage and the base.  Spent $5.00 on a loaf of Italian bread too!
