if the dough is hard to work with, you should refrigerate it first before rolling it out for about an hour or so... it would be firm enough to be handled easily but soft enough to roll out. when the dough gets too soft to cut, pop it in the refrigerator again for another hour. it'll keep its shape. :)

This is a nice cookie, its not too sweet, its very hard to work with. I left the rolled dough in the fridge over night, and then was easier to cut.  But rolling it was very hard.  I was glad I rolled it out on wax paper so I could have the wax paper help me roll it tight.  Thanks again, this will be a recipe I will use for christmas time.  I will also use mint jelly for the nice red and green .. not together mind you!

I've made these cookies before a lot of times from a different, yet identical recipe from the early 1900s.  We use, in my family, chopped walnuts with raspberry jam (the kind with seeds in it, but the type without works, too).  We also add coconut and either pecans or walnuts into the jam mix when the whim takes us.  As an added note - roll your dough out onto wax paper and use it to roll the dough after adding the filling.  The recipe I use says to chill the dough over night and it really does make for better baking results.  These cookies are often kept in the freezer (for up to 3 months) rolled in wax paper (NOT cling wrap) and then placed into a freezer bag that has had all the air removed.  When ready to cook, either cut frozen or let the dough thaw overnight in the fridge.

Wonderful cookies, so easy.  Yes, the dough is soft, but all it needed was a little extra lovin'.  Definitely chill overnight.  I made a double batch for a cookie exchange.  My brother liked them so much, he ate 23 in one sitting. I used raspberry jam instead.  Definitely a favorite of mine.  Will be making these again probably in the next week for relatives.

I am so upset, as I had NO luck with these at all, they are easy enough, and quick, but my dough was way too soft to roll, and once i put the filling in, what a mess...I normally have NP with cookie recipes...I think I MAY give this one another go tomorrow, maybe I will refrigerate the dough a bit before I roll it out...

Terrible cookies.  The dough was impossible to work with, even after refrigeration.  The jam seeped out, leaving minimal flavor.  I will stick to to jam thumbprints from now on.

Excellent recipe! My friend and I baked cookies all day, and we made about 7 different kinds of all really yummy and pretty cookies but I think this one was the best! It's really easy to make, and many people liked this one the most. They described it as an "everyday cookie", and I'd have to agree, because I could probably make this and eat this everyday. I was worried about it being able to keep its round shape but it's no problem if you keep the dough in the fridge long enough.

I made these cookies for a cookie exchange that we had at work.  I got rave reviews on them!  They were so good!  

I must say that the dough is a little  crumbly and difficult to work with, I thought I was going to have to make another batch or find a different dough recipe, but I managed with it.

I had to roll the dough out in a cookie sheet lined with wax paper in order for it to stay together.  that worked out really well for me becuase i was able to get the sheet into a perfect rectangle and then roll it up with the wax paper to help me.  

Also another thing is that they got really toasty on the back side so maybe use a lower temperature so that way they bake through before they toast too much.  

I will definitely be experimenting with other fillings for these cookies because it is a great recipe!!

I made these cookies for May Day and all of my friends and teachers loved them! I only put nuts in to the ones for me and my parents because my friends can't handle nuts, but both types were delicious. I think it was the first time I had ever had strawberry jam, amazingly enough, and I really enjoyed it! Rolling the dough was a bit tricky, but since I made several batches of these cookies, by the time I rolled the third I had the hang of it. I will most definitely make these again.

These cookies were very good. Use a good quality jam or jelly.  I had trouble rolling the dough, but even in the places where the filling broke through the cookies looked nice and once it sat in the fridge it was easy to cut the next day (definitely leave in fridge overnight to firm up.) The cookies were very moist and stayed moist for days.

This recipe was great! I had trouble rolling it, don't worry if it breaks a little, once it's in the fridge it will harden up. The cookies will look wonderful. =)

I have made this several times already.  They turned out good each time.  This recipe will be in my recipe box.
