These were pretty good. I used corn kernels fresh off the cob. It was pretty tasty.

We found these cakes to be not nearly as interesting as we had hoped and we didn't care for the sauce.

You need a good sauce to offset the blandness of these.  I added another egg, more seasoning, and used fresh corn.
