This was a big hit at dinner party I went too.  I didn't have a graham cracker crust so I just used a regular crust.  Also I had a few oreo's that I crushed up and put in the mixture.

Must have done something wrong. The texture was chewy like marshmallow paste, or the ice cream that dries on the lid of the container. Not what I was looking for.

I make this for my VERY picky husband.  I use chocolate pudding, add a little bit of sweetened condensed milk (about a 1/4 c, then reduce the milk to 1 c) and I add milk chocolate chips on top.  He looooves it and it is sooooo easy!

I used fat free CoolWhip, fat free Jello pudding mix, and ultra low fat cream cheese to make this a guilt free cheesecake (well almost!)  It turn out amazing and people couldn't even tell if was low fat, low sugar.
