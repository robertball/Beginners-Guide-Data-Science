My family absolutely loved this recipe!  I did make some changes.  I used way more than 4 cups of broccoli, I had brought 3 big bunches (almost 4 lbs.) and used all of it, also I kind of lost track of time and cooked it longer which was fine for us since we prefer our broccoli softer vs. crunchy. Cooked it in a big 6qt pot but still used 4 cups of broth. I also used vegetable broth instead of water, 1/2&1/2 instead of milk, and added a finely chopped garlic clove and 2 finely chopped carrots with the onion and celery. I had to use some of the liquid to puree the broccoli, so I thought it was going to end up too thick and I would need more liquid at the end, but it was actually an excellent creamy consistency. Thank you for such an excellent recipe and for the extra ideas in the many detailed reviews! I will be making this soup over and over and over!!!

Amazing soup - but I made a few changes.  I used about 6-7 cups broccoli and instead of water I used chicken broth (5 cups) or so - enough to cover the broccoli while boiling.  I put ALL the broccoli in the blender using some of the reserved stock.  1% milk worked great - and I did add garlic to the other veggies - cooked them for about 6 minutes.  I also reserved 1/4 cup milk at the end and added it with about 1tbsp cornstarch to thicken. Season with salt and pepper - and this one's a winner.

although I did make changes I am rating this 5 stars.  I omitted the ckn bouillon and used ckn broth for the water instead.  I also sauteed a minced garlic clove in with my onion/celery. I pureed/chopped ALL of the cooked broccoli in my food processor before adding it back into the soup.  I added the cheese to the soup after it was thickened with the milk.  I did hold out 1/3 c. of the milk because I wanted to make sure it would be thick enough. I added just short of a TBSP of cornstarch to that saved milk and stirred it into the soup for added thickness.  I have never added nutmeg to my broccoli soup and I think this addition is quite a pleasant surprise.

Simple and delicious soup. I used half and half instead of whole milk and it was nice and creamy and I think anything less would of made this "runny". I also suggest taking your time and maybe preparing this an hour or so before the rest of dinner 'cause the flavors really settle in. Thanks so much and enjoy!

This recipe was delicious!  I made a few changes, ommitting the milk and flour and substituting 1 cup cream. (low carb diet) And instead of dirtying the food processor I added some broccoli, used a hand blender, then added more chunks.  As other reviewers suggested, I would add much more cheese next time.  And one with lots of flavor, like a sharp cheddar.

This is the perfect soup. My 11 month old daughter was like a little bird flapping her arms and opening her mouth when I fed her this soup and she literaly licked the bowl clean. I mixed about 1 1/2 cups of shredded cheese into the soup while it was still on the burner. This helped thicken the soup and added to the savorieness of the soup.

Best thing about this soup is that the broccoli is not over cooked, which gives the soup a garden fresh taste.  I will also put asparagus, zucchini, and green bell pepper in the soup with the broccoli.  I also use the parts of the veggies that you wouldn't normally eat. Like the stalk on the broccoli and the ends on asparagus and put those parts in the blender.

This soup was delicous! I felt it needed quite a bit of salt, pepper, garlic salt and seasoning salt, which I added, and it was great! Yummy, warm and healthy meal.

I really liked this!!! I only used half an onion and probably will use less celery next time or chop it very fine. I didn't puree any of the broccoli, I just chopped it very fine and then added bigger chunks of. I used 1c. Skim Milk, 1c. Light evaporated milk, and 1/2 c. Heavy cream. Extra cheese was added as well as salt. It did need some salt. I also didn't use chicken boullion, but substituted with 2 TBSP canned chicken broth. Overall an excellent recipe.

Phenomenal recipe.  Followed as best I could except I didn't reserve the water so I substituted with chicken broth.  It was plenty thick, you just have to cook it down  until it's creamy prior to adding milk.  Then you have to cook it until it's thick again prior to adding the broccoli.

This a good soup but I did have to play with the recipe a little. One whole (yellow) onion was overpowering the soup so I reduced it to half an onion. It was still too much onion flavor, so I reduced it again to a quarter of an onion and that was more to my family's taste. I also used half-and-half instead of whole milk for richer flavor. This soup is really best eaten the following day after the flavors have had a chance to blend overnight. It freezes well and reheats without losing any of the creamy texture. Recommended!

This is a wonderful cream of broccoli soup!  To make it lower in fat I used 1 Â½ cups of 1% milk and eliminated the butter.  To avoid lumps be sure to blend the flour with a bit of the broccoli water before adding it to the onions and celery.  I also like a heartier soup so I doubled the amount of broccoli and celery.  Very good and low in fat!

I love this soup!  Made some changes 1) used chicken broth instead of water 2) sauted a few cloves of chopped garlic before adding the onion mixture 3) added leeks and cooked them with the onion and celery 4) added diced potatoes during the addition of the chicken broth 5) Used 2% instead of whole 6) added cheddar cheese to the soup mixture during the final milk phaze as well as putting some on top for each serving 7) added garlic salt and extra pepper.  I can't wait to have the left overs for lunch tomorrow!!

I've made this recipe many times, both as written and with my own variations. I adore it, and just wanted to address a few things :
â¢This is not a thick, pasty soup. It manages to be creamy without being stick-to-your-ribs. To add creaminess with less fat than half & half, consider evaporated milk.
â¢As written, this is heavy in onion flavor, which I love, though some may choose to cut back.
â¢There is something magical about the blend of bouillon powder (or cubes) with dairy. This soup is one case where I would NOT substitute chicken stock or broth. The reason no salt is added is because bouillon is so salty. I actually add a bit more than is called for.
â¢DO blend half the broccoli and leave half chopped. The blending incorporates flavor, the chopped adds texture.
Time permitting, using half broccoli and half cauliflower is delicious, but you need to cook them separately, so half of each can be blended and half chopped.  I've also added a diced red potato or two to make a "cream of everything" soup. 
â¢ The cheese (even a little extra) may be stirred into the soup at the end and will meld in nicely.

Delicious! The nutmeg is a perfect touch that gives it a unique flavor.  I used mozzarella instead of cheddar bc that's all I had on hand and it is very tasty!

this was my first time making and eating broccoli soup!! omg this was delicious, and took probably less than 20 min start to finish.  I had lots of steamed broccoli from the night before, so I used that and didn't have to cook it!!  I halved the recipe since it was just for me, and it came out so amazing!!  I didn't have celery or nutmeg but that's ok :)    I used a mix of half heavy cream and half water since I didn't have milk but prefer the cream anyway!  I used one can of beef broth instead of the broccoli-boil water+ the chicken boullion stuff.  I prefer beef broth in soups :)  This was a gloriously simple recipe that I will use many times!!  it makes my soul happy :)

I just made this and it is fantastic! Perfect paired with a grilled cheese sandwich. I used bullion cubes instead of powder and added a bit of cream cheese to make it a bit creamier.

I am a cook at an assisted living home and I'm always looking for good, quick, and easy recipes.  My supervisor who is also a cook gave me this one to make just yesterday.  I could not believe how great it turned out.  It was delicious!  Funny thing about it was I forgot to garnish the top with the cheddar cheese, but no one missed it, because the soup was so good, it stood alone...lol.

Very tasty!  I made a few modifications: I added two diced carrots and a little extra celery.  I skipped the flour as I'm gluten-intolerant.  I also added some crushed red pepper flakes, coarse salt, and fresh cracked pepper to the veggies.  I think I also went a bit heavy on the broccoli.  I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk and thickened the soup at the end with grated cheddar.  Awesome, hearty soup!

This soup is so good! I had to substitutethe whole milk with two cups 1% and a half cup of evaporated milk and chicken broth instead of bullion cubes. I also used frozen broccoli florets half cut and half I mashed with a potato masher, worked out great. Thank You So Much for this Recipe.

I made this recipe using chicken/vegy stock instead of water and omitted the chicken bouillion. As per another reviewer's suggestion, I used 1% milk to cut down on the fat. I did add 1/4 cup half-n-half with some corn starch in it at the end to thicken up the soup and add a little richness. overall, we all liked this recipe, especially with grated, melted cheese on top - that made it tasty! Per personal preference, I thought it was a bit too much nutmeg - will only use about 1/2 the amount called for next time. Thank you for the recipe - both my kids got in a serving of broccoli this way!!

This recipe was great! I used chicken stock instead of water. I added more celery, brocoli, and carrots to pack in the veggies for my kids! I pureed all the veggies in my blender to hide them from the kiddies too ;o) I would definitely use a little half and half to thicken the soup next time like someone suggested. I also added garlic salt and more salt and pepper. Another great addition to this was putting Velveeta chunks of cheese into the last few minutes of simmering. Yum!

I was very disappointed. I read rave reviews and this was really bland.  It was made salavagable by adding a lot of salt and cheese to the main soup.

This was the first time I had attempted to make a cream of broccoli soup.  After reading through a few different recipes, I decided on this one...and I'm SO glad I did!  Not only was it easy to make, but it was delicious to eat.  I did cut down on the onion, used 1/2 & 1/2, and increased the butter to 1/3 of a cup to match the amount of flour.  I also made sure to add the nutmeg--it added a nice flavor as well as aroma.  The best part, as always, was cooking it with my 4 y/o who was very proud of her work!  Yum!

I really liked it, except for the fact that I needed to put some salt. I didn't use celery because I don't like it, maybe that's why I had to add salt.

This was my first attempt at cream of broccoli soup.  It was delish!  After reading other recipes on allrecipes.com, I decided to use 3 cans of chicken broth in place of the water and bouillon.  I also added some leftover cauliflower and almost doubled the broccoli.  I added more cheese too.  A definite keeper!

Delicious, even tasted good the next day.  Pureed almost all of the broccoli, chopped up the rest, also added hot sauce at the end to taste, it warms you from the inside out!

Super tasty.  I doubled the broc and boiled in chix broth, then used that broth for the soup base.  Used mostly nonfat milk then about 1/2c heavy cream for a little richness.  Threw it all in the food processor for a smoother texture.  Didn't add cheese til serving, then just sprinkled on top.  Loved it!

Very good! I added a tblsp of cornstarch at the end and put cheese in the indiv. bowls. I like my soups a little more salty so I kicked up the salt and pepper and added a tsp of italian spice. I also used chicken stock.

Made this without cheddar cheese.  To save time, I boiled the broccoli (I used 6 cups) in 6 cups of chicken broth, then mashed it straight in the pot with a potato masher.  Very yummy - really liked the nutmeg!

This is a good base recipe.  I too used chicken broth to cook the broccoli. I also added garlic and carrots and more chicken bouillon granules. My 1 and 3 year old liked it so I will be making this again.  It needs more of a cheesy flavor I think but then again it would not be that healthy for you.

My family and I absolutely loved this recipe!  I made a few adjustments: I used cauliflower & broccoli (not only broccoli).  I also added carrots to the onion and celery mixture (too add flavor).  I pureed the stock prior to adding the purreed broccoli/cauliflower.  Instead of adding the cheese as a garnish, I added all of it direclty to the finished soup and stirred until it was well incorporated.  Simply delicious!

I was dissapointed in this recipe.  I expected it to be much better from all the reviews.  It was watery and needed far more broccoli.  I had to run to the grocery store to buy more broccoli and cornstarch to thicken it up.  Just so-so.

This is fantastic soup.  I like mine a little thicker than this recipe makes it so I will add more flour next time when I am mixing the bouillion with he celery and onion.  I added more cheese for a richer flavor.  I will be making this agian and again.

I exchanged the bullion cubes & h20 for broth and could really tase the chicken broth base.  I wasn't super impressed, but that was my fault.  It needed something, I just can't put my finger on it.

This soup was just okay.  It wasn't very creamy, it was bland.  I made one change as stated in other reviews, I substituted chicken broth for the water and bouillion.  I only used whole milk and thought that would make it creamy enough but it didn't.  If I happen to try this recipe again I will try it with a portion of half and half not all just whole milk.

Wonderful and easy to make.  I tried to puree half of the broccoli, but my blender broke.  However, I finely chopped the broccoli instead and the soup still turned out fabulous.

This was fabulous with just a couple of minor changes.  I added some garlic and carrot in with the onion and celery, and I replaced about half the milk with half and half.  I like my cream of broccoli creamy!  Sprinkled some cheese on top and YUM!  I will definitely be making this again and again.

Loved this recipe ---It's a keeper. I had lots of 1/2 & 1/2 & also heavy cream that needed to be used before going bad so use 1 cup of each instead of the milk.    Also used 3 cups of chicken broth instead of water. The results were fabulous.

This was an excellent soup. I even added some bacon to enhance the flavor. I also used the chicken broth that other people recommended instead of the water and boullion powder.

Sorry, but this soup was just alright. The only modification that I made was using skim milk. It still turned out thick and creamy by cooking longer. I didn't like the nutmeg. Should definately omit this. And even though I generally love onions, I found the onion flavour way too strong. Did not taste 'broccoli-ish' enough. Will modify if I make it again.

I've made this twice already and love it each time.  I don't have any nutmeg so have not added any.  But the flavor is very good anyway.  I add the cheese right before its done simply because I like it that way.  Also this tastes better and better days later, trust me.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

This was my first try at Cream of Broccoli Soup, and this recipe was perfect--easy to prepare, thick, and delicious.  Try serving the soup in individual heat-proof soup bowls, topped with generous portions of cheddar, and let the bowls sit under the broiler just until the cheese browns a bit.  Worked great for me. Thanks for a fine recipe.***AMENDMENT: I just bought an immersion blender, and, believe me, it cut the prep time of this recipe in half!! No more slopping the hot broccoli into the blender.  Take my advice--get yourself an immersion blender if you don't already have one; what a great appliance!

Easy and delicious.  I only made one adjustment to "lighten" the fat content.  I used 1% milk instead of whole and decreased the amount to 1.5 cups.

Made some changes to make more healthy and flavorful! 1) used low sodium chicken broth instead of water 2) added garlic and finely diced carrot (sometimes I will add in a yellow squash or a tiny bit of shredded cabbage or kale or leeks for additional nutrition without altering the taste)   3) Used fat free half and half + greek yogurt to thicken and make creamy  4) I typically omit the flour and use a bit of instant potato flakes 5) add red pepper flakes to taste 6) parmesan cheese or other hard sharp cheeses top off the dish!  enjoy!

Excellent! Use chicken broth instead of water, thickened with a bit of flour mixed with broth, pureed and then added evaporated milk and more broccoli florets and a little bit of cheese. Very tasty!

Love the nutmeg ~  Great flavor!  My kids LOVE this soup and beg for it.  I need to double the recipe everytime.   Agree it could be thicker.  I think I will add bit more flour next time.

Very good. Easy to make. Great way to use up the stalks of the broccoli. Blended those, chopped the florets. Halved the recipe since I didn't have enough broccoli and used 1% milk since that was all I had. But it thickened up beautifully and tasted great! The only awkward part was using a magic bullet to blend the broccoli. I had to keep pausing and reshaking the jar. Things went smoother when I added some of the milk / broth base into the bullet to blend. Will definitely make again!

This recipe was so good.  The whole family loved it.  I will quote my 5 year old by saying "it's out of this world good".  I used chicken broth instead of water and also the bouillon.  I also used 2 stalks of cellery and 1 potatoe.  I didn't have whole milk so I used 1%.  One word: awsome!!!!

the best yet!!  I love cream of broccoli soup, and this one has flavor, and the veggies left in chunks are a big hit as well.  I always have to make a double batch, so we have some left over.  I use chicken broth instead of the water and the bullion.  I tend to like my soups thicker, so I add more veggies, more flour and a bit less milk.

I didn't have celery, so used 2 teaspoons of celery salt as a substitute.  Used box of premade chicken stock.  Added 2 cups of sliced carrots and chopped broccoli stalks, and 1 1/2 cups monterey jack/cheddar mix.  Very delicious!

3.5 stars: I had to remind myself this is a "Cream of" soup and I was looking for a broccoli cheese soup.  With that in mind, the recipe itself was good.  I used the microwave steamer broccoli, chicken broth instead of water and should have decreased the buillion powder a bit.  If I make it again, I will not put as much nutmeg, just a dash.   I also think the butter should be doubled to make a smoother roux.  I did add a LOT of cheese.

Loved this recipe! I didn't have any celery so I used celery seeds which were great. For the onions I sauteed them in the pot, then took them out and put them in the blender with the broccoli. I also used a LOT of cheese to make this a cream of broccoli and CHEESEY soup. Will definitely be making this soup again and again.

This soup is awesome!  I had some leftover carrots that I chopped up and added with the onion and celery.  I also used some fat free half and half that I had left over and skim milk for the rest of the 2 1/2 cups.  It turned out amazing.

My boyfriend and I really enjoy this soup. It turns out to be thick even though I didn't use whole milk, I always use 1% because that is what I always have on hand. This soup is now in my regular rotation of meals, you have to try it.

This is a great recipe for broccoli and cheese soup.  I did make a few changes to suit my own tastes.  I used chicken broth instead of water and put in a lot more cheese than called for- probably 2 1/2 cups in total.  To make it richer I used 1 cup of half and half and only 1 cup of milk.  I also didn't bother putting celery in it.  I'm sure the original recipe is good the way it is I just prefer a thicker broccoli soup.  All in all a very good recipe! Thanks!

Very good recipe. Would have been better with half and half though. I used chicken soup base instead of bouillon for a richer flavor. I increased the servings 40 with no issues.

This was pretty good.  I made a couple changes as it was very bland when it was done.  I added 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese.  It added needed salt and some cheese flavor.  I also used 1/2 whole milk and 1/2 skim.  Next time I will use 3/4 skim because I never noticed the difference and I didn't feel that guilty eating it.

Just "okay".  Prep took much longer than 20 minutes since the soup didn't seem to thicken very quickly.  Eventually, I needed to add some cornstarch to aid. Also, you don't need the full 2 1/2 cups of milk. I only used 2 and it still wasn't as thick as I expect from a cream soup.  Needs more flavor.  Possibly more boullion?  Could do without the nutmeg as well.  Kids loved it.  Hubby doesn't need me to make it again.

Wow!  This is fantastic!!  There was none leftover to take a picture of!  In place of the water, I used one 14.5 oz. can of chicken broth, and one 14.5 oz. can of vegetable broth.  I also used one cup of half and half and 1 1/2 cups 2% milk, and mixed about one cup of cheese right into the soup instead of using it as garnish.  I don't care that it is supposed to be hot and humid, I am making this soup again this weekend!

This soup is incredible!  I made it this afternoon and I already had four bowls.  My stomach is about to burst but can't stop eating it.  My picky 4 year old had half a bowl, which is incredible in itself.  Thank you, Thank you.

I followed one of the other reveiwers and added more broccoli, some garlic and cornstarch to thicken a tad at the end. i also used 1% milk.. I like the fact that this recipe doesnt use cream, it is much heathlier this way. Over all a really good soup and i will make it again.

This was a very easy recipe to follow and really showcased the broccoli I used.  My daughters loved it and asked for second of it.  I gave it 4 stars because it felt like it was missing something and didn't really thicken up the way I expected it to with the amount of flour in it.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious.  I didn't bother to grate the cheese, just put it in in chunks and that worked great.

I had a really difficult time getting this to thicken.  I ended up having to use more flour... and some heavy cream...
The flavor was actually pretty bland (maybe due to the extra flour...?).
I think I prefer a more cheesy broccoli soup.

Really loved this soup!  Great comfort food and nutritious too! I omitted the celery because I didn't have any and added carrots.  Also used 1/2 evaporated milk.  Really outstanding.

Very good base for broccoli soup. I added a lot more cheese than called for, and more broccoli florets, but we've made this several times, and love it. I will continue to make this again!

I found the broccoli soup to be a bit thin.  It tasted good but I wouldn't go so far to say delicious.  My children seemed to like it however we are accustom to the traditional cream of broccoli soup that is nice and thick.  As per other reviewers,I also used chicken broth in place of the water and used half and half instead of milk.  I also used extra broccoli and at the end I added shredded chedder to the pot.  A nice twist was that I poured the soup into individual bread bowls which the kids loved.

I love this receipe. I did make 2 pounds of broccoli so I increased the water to 10 cups.  I used chicken broth instead of the boullion.  I also increased the flour to half of cup. I think the tip of the immersion blender was a good idea.

I just made this soup for lunch today, and it was my first time branching out from my family's recipe and trying something different. I would definitely recommend it, it was quick and easy, and quite good. The only change I made was to leave out the onion and cheese.

One of my favourites in my cooking "career" so far. I used veggie broth to cook the broccoli (and added one potato at this stage) and omitted the chicken boulion. I took the suggestions of some posters are pureed all the broccoli. I threw in about a cup of cheddar at the end of cooking and garnished with extra cheddar. Excellent soup. Will definitely make it again.

I love this soup! We often have steamed broccoli for dinner and now when I do I prepare double the ammont and set aside the rest for broccoli soup later in the week. This recipe works really well with an immersion blender, easy to make everything in one pot and very little clean up required. Even my kids will eat this. Love it, 5 stars!

LOVED this soup! Great & different way to get more veggies in my diet! I added a BIG handful of shredded cheese into the soup at teh end (and I think using chicken broth makes a big difference). I will make this again.

Very, very good broccoli cheese soup.  I added some garlic to the onions/celery, and used chicken broth as suggested.  I also blended the onion/celery/flour/broth mixture in the blender, so there weren't chunks.  This wasn't the BEST ever, I am still trying to find the closest recipe to TGI Friday's Broccoli soup.  Thank you!!

Hey,
This is a nice and easy recipe my daughter made it for my guests one day and it tasted great they all loved it and asked for the recipe.  But I recomend using 1/2 or 1/4 onion.

This is a good soup and pretty much what I think cream of broccoli should be. The onion needs to saute longer than 4 minutes in order not to overpower the soup with sharp onion taste though. I used canned chicken broth instead of water and chicken bouillon.

We really enjoyed this soup.  I used a bit of fat free half & half & the rest skim milk.  I used chicken broth instead of water/bullion and pureed the entire mixture.  I used double the cheese & it turned out great.  A keeper.

Great recipe! Made a few changes such as added carrots and crushed garlic. Might try potatoes next time as well. Used cheese but stirred it in rather than sprinkling on top. Also crumbled some cooked bacon into it which seems to enhance the flavour a bit. Seems a good recipe to build on.

Great! I did make some changes, though. Used one head of broccoli and 2 cups of water, instead of 4. Used 3 tablespoons margargine instead of 2. Omitted the onion, celery, nutmeg and chicken bouillon powder. 

Used fresh minced garlic (the kind in a jar)and sauteed with butter. (Added flour to make roux paste)

I also added some of the cooked broccoli water to thin out to proper soup consistency.

I used 4 seasonings...salt, black pepper, Spike, and celery salt. Added cheese while cooking and also sprinkled some on top of each serving bowl. Made 3 or 4 servings. YUM!!

Next time I'll add some crumbled cooked bacon on top!

This was awesome..Generally I don't change a recipe..But I used 2 cups of heavy cream, 1/2 cup 1% milk, couldn't find the nutmeg so didn't use it, a dash of salt, and added two cups of shredded cheddar while it was cooking. EXCELLENT.

Every recipe I have tried for broccoli soup has been bland and watery, but this one is just what I was looking for. I used half and half and only 1/2 the onion suggested. Also, DO NOT omit the nutmeg. It makes the soup so much better! The taste is very similar to the broccoli soup served at Old Country Buffet. YUMMY!! If I could give it ten stars....... I would! Thanks William!

Very good!  I added cooked ground sausage which complimented it very well.  I looked forward to taking this for lunch the next day.

I am always going to stores to bring home some Cream of Broccoli soup.  I always wanted to learn how to make it at home and have found the perfect recipe.  Move over Emeril, boy is this great soup! I made it as an appetizer for Easter dinner and everyone loved it.  It received lots of rave reviews and I will be making this at least twice a month.  I did add more sharp cheddar and salt and pepper while it was cooking, and oh my, this is even better the second day..Thanks for the great recipe William!!

I found this a bit bland.  I added a fair amount of sharp cheddar to each bowl as well as some to the soup to add some zing.  Texture was good, but I prefer a 'cheesier' version.

Changed out 2 cups of whole milk for heavy (whipping) cream and used 1/2 cup of whole milk. Omitted the cheddar cheese it was so delicious!. Even my  year old picky eater liked it!. Also my 14  ear old son and husband commented how delicious it was!. Definitely have to make it again and take pictures next time as well!....

I made a modified version - no milk and vegetable bullion instead of chicken. Also used a full teaspoon of nutmeg, and half a teaspoon of salt and purÃ©ed the entire thing so I didnât need the milk to thicken it. The nutmeg and broccoli combination is amazing and I hadnât thought to use it in a broccoli soup before!

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time was as written and the family was not at all fond of the nutmeg backdrop. But I still needed a broccoli soup recipe! This time I tweaked the recipe just a little: I split the milk between 2% milk  and 10 % (cereal cream), as that is what I had; I also purÃ©ed all of the broccoli, using a tad more, - 6 cups; and lastly, I added 1/2 c shredded cheese to the soup, in addition to the 1/2 c of cheese for garnish. It was yummy, and everyone enjoyed it, BUT I noticed it tasted even BETTER the next day when I took leftovers to work for lunch! I will have to try to remember to make this a day ahead (or early in the morning) next time we serve it for supper!

I followed this recipe except for using 2% milk to cut calories.  When finished, it was a little bland for us so I added garlic powder to taste, which gave it the fuller flavor for us.  I'll make it again.

I   sauted the onions in butter and added the flour to cook a couple of minutes, then added a little evaporated milk and set aside, cut up the florets added to the chicken broth for more flavor to simmer, added the onion/flour mixture and stirred. Put into my mini food processor to puree in two steps. Added little white wine for more flavor.
Made mistake of adding frozen cauliflower rice with lemon- great flavor but didn't like the grainy texture of the cauliflower-rice.

I made this delicious creamy soup last week and we enjoyed it!  The nutmeg spice really added a great taste in this recipe. 
I didn't add anything but added a bit of sharp cheddar at the end. Amazing! Will certainly do this again.

This is a classic recipe that  has great flavor and can easily be changed to meet personal preferences. I followed the recipe exactly except for the addition of about 1 C. of chopped carrots which I boiled with the broccoli for another layer of flavor. Also before adding the cooked chopped broccoli I used my immersion blender on the soup. Made the process a lot quicker.

I made some changes by doubling the water because I had 4 medium heads of broccoli, and used the stems and florets. I also used 2 stalks of celery. I did not use flour or chicken bouillon but used a Knorr brand broccoli soup mix instead for the flour portion. I put half the broccoli in the food processor as suggested, and used the suggested amount of nutmeg and pepper. I used 1% milk and added some 5% cream. The soup was good, it was thin and did not thicken much. It was good, I will make it again, did not need the cheese.

A fine soup that, to me, brought out the essence of broccoli in highlight. It was a recipe that was quick to assemble. I pre-cooked the solitary broccoli head in my possession, (topping up the 4-cup measure with some cabbage), in the microwave oven so that it would be processed tender in the food processor. I liked the 'add the amount of cheese you think it needs' approach to its serving.

This was easy to make and absolutely delicious. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Only thing I changed was instead of using whole milk, I used part milk and part half and half, since I only had so much of each in the fridge. Still came out very tasty.

I loved it, but I've got to admit that I used it as a basis for my own -- no measuring. I used leftover steamed broccoli, dehydrated onion, water, chicken base, a bit of garlic powder, a bit of onion powder, powdered coffee creamer with the milk, flour, whatever cheese I had in the refrigerator, a bit of nutmeg, a bit of pepper, and salt.  I just kept adding until it tasted right. A salad and French baguette bread made a great meal.

Lightened this up by using almond milk.  Also, used vegetable broth instead of water.  Didn't get as thick but was tasty.

This is possibly my favorite soup!  I've made this recipe many times.  I just do a couple of things differently.  I add a pound of cooked ground sweet sausage for flavor and protein.  I also use a stick of butter instead of 2 Tb.  (I misread the directions first time I made it and thought that's how much I was supposed to use, it came out yummy so I've never changed it.)  I use a lot of broccoli, I don't measure it just fill my pot about 3/4 with raw broccoli and 4 c. liquid and stir it periodically.  It cooks down and I don't bother with pureeing it anymore, I just chop it all.  I also prefer to use heavy cream, though I've made it with light or half and half if that's what I already have in the fridge open.  I stir in at least a cup of pizza cheese (cheddar and mozzarella) towards end of cooking time and melt it right into the soup.  This is perfect for a cozy winter meal.  Serve with homemade bread, rolls, or biscuits and you've got a delicious meal!

Very good, the only changes i made was not using water and instead used chicken broth, I did not use bullion.  My whole family ate this including the picky 7 year old and 17 year old teenager.  Woo!

It's good  a healthy, lower calorie soup.  If we weren't dieting I'd have to beef it up to a broccoli cheese soup. It just seems to be a bit to green tasting for us.  I used chicken broth, extra garlic, carrots, red pepper, extra onion, onion salt.....and still can't get up to 4 stars.  I probably would have enjoyed a plate of steamed broccoli more and done a lot less work. We will eat it but, might have trouble getting thru the whole pot. Thank you for the recipe. It's just not what I had hoped for.

It was pretty good, although not quite as thick as I like my soups to be.  I cooked the broccoli in chicken broth instead of water and added a full two cups of shredded cheese (I pictured it being more cheesy).  The real test will come in the next few days when we see if the left overs get eaten or tossed.

I made this on Christmas and we LOVED IT! It was just as good reheated the next day. The only thing I did differently to this was added about an extra 1/4 cup of flour to thicken it a little more and salt to taste. I also mixed in a little shredded mozzarela along with the cheddar.

This soup was delicious! Followed recipe exactly and used half and half cream as recommended for a richer, creamier soup. It was perfect!

My family loved this soup! Even the baby ate it all and had seconds :) I also added more broccoli and only blended the hard parts of the broccoli. Then I smashed/cut the florets. Definitely a keeper!

This soup is delicious and easy to make. like many others I did make some adjustments but I think that is the whole point with dishes like soup.  First I like to avoid glutens and wheat so I added finely ground almonds to the butter instead of flour. This is a trick I learned in a Butter Chicken recipe here on Allrecipies.com. Apparently in India they don't thicken with flour. I didn't bother adding the cheese. Feel free to play around with the recipe.  No celery. That's ok. Want to add some salt.That's ok too.  But the basic recipe is great !!!

This was excellent -- hard to believe that someone gave it 3 stars because it didn't have as much salt as they liked -- that's assumed salt to your taste in my book.  I made almost as directed -- just decreased the milk by 1/2 cup because I like it a little thicker.  I also added 12 oz of crawfish at the very end, but the soup was great before I did that -- just felt like I would like the soup with crawfish and a little heat ... and I did.  I can see adding more veggies to this soup too .. thanks for the great recipe.

I thought the soup was too runny for a "cream" soup, even after holding back 1/2 cup of milk.  I added a Tbsp of corn starch and melted 2 cups of cheddar in the soup to thicken it up.  I also thought there was plenty of broccoli.  It just seemed to miss the mark for me.

It was like onion milk with broccoli in it. The soup never thickened and the nutmeg was a strange choice of spices. I made the recipe exactly as stated.

I loved this soup, but I did have to adjust the recipe.
-To give the soup a nicer color I added 1/2 tsp of turmeric, and 2 carrots. I boiled the carrots with the broccoli and then processed them.

- I use chicken broth, not water.

- I did not measure the broccoli I used but they were two large stalks. I processed the stalks and roughly chopped the florets.

-And I added alot more cheese than is recommended, probably 1 cup instead of 1/2.

Good base recipe with a few minor modifications - after reading a lot of reviews I used chicken broth instead of water and a combo of milk and half and half for richness.  In my opinion, this needed more seasoning - I added quite a bit of salt.  Also, for additional thickening near the end of cooking time, I stirred in appx 3/4 cup of instant mashed potato flakes - this worked for thickening as well as adding more flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made this for dinner tonight, and my husband and I both loved it.  I used 2 cups 2% milk and 1/2 cup half and half cream, since that's what I had on hand, and it thickened nicely.  I did omit the nutmeg as hubby isn't a fan, but the flavour was perfect once I added just a little salt.  The broccoli flavour and crunch was just right, with half pureed and half chopped.  Will definitely be making this again, as I know my parents will enjoy it as well!

Recipe was a good starting point. I added diced carrots and roasted garlic to sautÃ©ed vegetables and boiled broccoli in a vegetable broth. Thought it was quite bland and added salt, pepper and a dash of cayenne.

This turned out fantastic! It was delicious and super easy. The only thing I did differently was I left out the nutmeg. I also didn't stir constantly during step three, and I should have. I will definitely be making this again!

Excellent! I used 2 percent milk and steamed the brocolli instead of boiling. I just added four cups of water to the mix (in addition to the steamed brocolli and pureed brocolli) and it came out great! I did add a bit more salt than recommended but  I found it needed it!

I had a really large bunch of broccoli to use before it went bad.  This was just what I was looking for.  I probably had too much water so I didn't use much milk.  I also wasn't paying attention to measuring out the flour so I added more with some of the cold milk, it worked out fine.  I'm sure I will make this again : )

A little thin but otherwise just what I was look for :)  I cooked it a bit longer to thicken in up, but next time I would probably use as much as twice the broccoli (and/or a bit more flour).

I forgot to put the milk in this recipe and it was still quite tasty - but not without having to tweak quite a lot of the spices beforehand - garlic, parsley, red pepper, etc.  Still - my kids actually ate it - so thank you!!

Excellent -- even slightly intoxicating....  But I'd cut the celery by half.  I'd also mention that the one should either follow through with the cheese on top or use a bit more rue (or melted cheese).

I used 1/2 water and 1/2 store bought chicken stock.  I added salt and we garnish with cheese when served.  Next time I am going to use 6 cups broccoli so I have more chunks.  Everyone loved it including my 2 and 4 year old and hubby!

Even my husband who won't touch broccoli had several bowls! Works well even without the chicken boullon powder, and I substituted soy milk for whole milk.

Great soup!  I think next time I will process all of the broccoli for a less chunky texture.  I did add extra cheese, and mixed it in while still over heat.  A little bit of salt and it was fabulous.  Definitely will be in my "comfort foods" file!

Delicious recipe! My husband is a vegetarian, so I used vegetable bouillon instead of chicken. I will probably cut back the amount of salt next time as we both found it to be a bit too much. Otherwise we thoroughly enjoyed it.

This soup is amazing.  We put Cereal cream in instead of milk and it makes it very creamy.  My Sister-in-law asks for this every time she comes to visit.

I normally don't like broccoli cheese soups so I thought this would be a nice alternative. And it was! My family really enjoyed it! I didn't add the nutmeg and used a carton of chicken broth in place of the water and bullion cubes. I only had frozen broccoli on hand and steamed it in the microwave for a few minutes - threw some in the food processor and then threw the rest of the florets in the soup. We also don't drink whole milk so I didn't have any on hand but it tasted fine with 1% and a small carton of half n' half. Yummm!!! I will be making this again.

I cooked extra broccoli in low sodium chicken broth and added just a touch of Penzey's chicken soup base.  My immersion blender worked nicely, but I did leave some chunks of broccoli.  1% milk seemed to work fine here, and I finished the soup off with some dry sherry. I used a little less freshly grated nutmeg than called for since I was adding the sherry.  This was a quick, healthy, and delicious soup!

This soup was great.  I thickened it a little more but the flavor was out of this world. I had expected to have left overs but it didn't last long and that was in a family of 2.

This soup was very good, instead of water and bouillon I used chicken broth. I also used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk. My teenage son was a little under the weather and this really hit the spot with him...thanks.

A good soup, for sure.  I used 1% milk because it's what I had and I forgot to buy celery.  It would have been better with whole milk and the celery I imagine.  Not sure if I like the nutmeg in there.

This soup is the closest I have come at home to the Signature Soup Series we used to serve at Friendly's restaurants.  Not too thick, and intense flavor without being spicy.  I also like the combo of pureed and chopped broccoli.  This soup is a perfect partner to bread sticks or even bread bowls if you're ambitious.  I gave it four stars instead of five because I felt it was more complicated than most cooks want to make for a "soup" night.  Having made four of the cream of broccoli soups on this site, this is by far my favorite.  If you need a more "grown up" soup as a first course for a dinner party, try the Broccoli and Mustard soup at the bottom of the page.

Just like my grandma used to make.  I added potatoes and used half and half instead of whole milk.  I also cooked the broccoli in chicken broth like some of the other reviews stated and it was perfect.

Great soup, and easy to make. I add a bit more broccoli, an extra Tbsp chicken bouillon powder, and 1/2 tsp season salt. It turns out perfect every time.

I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out very runny. And the nutmeg unpleasantly overwhelmed rather than enhanced the flavor of the soup. And was 1/2 cup cheese meant to garnish the entire recipe? I won't be making this again.

This was very tasty, and I enjoyed the consistency.  I don't like very thick soup so this was perfect for me.  Had some trouble with the flour, it formed little lumps.

This was really good. I used half and half like a few others suggested as well as chicken broth in place of water and bouillon. Will make this again.

I'M EXCITED ABOUT THIS RECIPE! THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE TRIED TO MAKE A CREAM SOUP.  THIS RECIPE WAS A PERFECT BASIC RECIPE TO LEARN FROM; I FEEL I CAN USE THE BASICS OF IT FOR OTHER SOUPS.  I FOLLOWED IT EXACTLY EXCEPT FOR OMITTING THE NUTMEG AND DECIDED TO TRY A SLIGHT SPRINKLE IN A BOWL OF SOUP BEFORE ADDING IT TO THE WHOLE POT.  I USED THE HALF AND HALF SO I WOULD NOT NEED THE RICHNESS OF CHEESE ADDED TO THE SOUP.  I DO USE IT FOR A GARNISH THOUGH.  THANKS FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE. IT'LL BE A COMMON MEAL IN OUR HOME FROM NOW ON!

This soup was excellent and easy to prepare. The onions and celery need more than 3 or 4 minutes to get tender though. Other than that very minor problem, this was just what I was looking for. We'll have this agaijn and again. Thanks!

I had to add a lot of salt and cheese to this recipe.  I didn't think it had enough taste.  I also followed the advice of others and omitted the nutmeg.

I loved this recipe. It was a great way to make ahead soup. I did everything except add the milk part till right before dinner and it was great. I am going to try and freeze the first half of the recipe and add the milk after I defrost and see how that comes out. Can't wait to try that. I added half and half instead of milk.

This recipe is worth trying and adjusting to your own taste.  I used half and half with some 1% milk.  I think it is best to use a pitch of the nutmeg.  1/4 tsp was a little to much.  The sharp cheese really makes this soup complete.  My eight year old loves it.  I will definately follow this recipe again but with a few minor changes.

This was delicious~!  I love broccoli soup, and it came out wonderful.  I added triple the broccoli, and I had cube biullon and used 2, it was soooo salty that I had to fix with more milk, hence the extra broccoli and cheese. Thanks William!

I love cream of broccoli soup!  but not with nutmeg.  Skip that, add more butter or margarine to match the flour, salt to taste, and add cheese to the pot.  Makes it more creamy.  Shredded cheese can also be added to garnish.  TYVM

Good recipe except I used cauliflower.  I also used my own homemade chicken broth. Made the roux after sautee of onions and carrots with fresh crushed garlic cloves and fresh ground pepper.  The nutmeg does make a big difference. Don't forget to use the hand submergiable blender (boat motor).  Much easier than a counter top blender or food processor to clean up.

Outstanding recipe! I needed to get rid of some cut-up broccoli before it went bad and this was a winner. Followed the recipe to the letter. The nutmeg is a great addition.

Excellent, fast & easy.  A little thin for me as written, but I prepared more roux to add to thicken the soup. I used 1/2 & 1/2 and 1% milk, but that combo is too thin. Recipe needs the full onion. I cut back to 1/2 of a medium onion, and it could use more. I also added 1 cup cheddar to the pot. Excellent. Will make it again.

This soup was great!  I read other reviews about the onion, so I only added 1 green onion. I had to spice it up a bit with some extra pepper, garlic powder and a little salt.  Great recipe William!

Really good! I used skim milk to cut down on fat and cals and it was still pretty thick and really tasty. I used half an onion and it still had a strong onion flavour. I also didn't have any nutmeg, but it was still awesome.

Excellent! I sprinkled a little cheddar on top as well before serving. One thing to be careful about is the butter/flour ratio. I had to add a little more butter so the flour cooked sufficently. I know that with roux or cream sauce bases you have to use 1/2 flour and 1/2 butter but the recipe had an odd amount. Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was rather bland until I added
cayenne pepper.  Next time I would also saute'
some garlic with the onion.  With the addition
of the pepper, family thought this was great.

Very tasty!  My texture didn't look very smoth.  I think maybe the flower didn't blend in completely.  It just didn't look like perfect creamy soup.  But the taste is great!

This soup was terrible. I only used half the onion required...and still the onion flavour was very overpowering. The soup wasnt very creamy tasting and the celery seemed like it didnt belong. I needed alot of cheddar to make it taste good. I won't be making this again

I doubled the recipe because I had so much broccoli ... this was my first try at cream of broccoli and I think this recipe is a good one.  I did use bouillon cubes instead of the powder and I added celery salt and a bit of crushed red pepper at the end.  This is good even without the cheese, and better the next day.
