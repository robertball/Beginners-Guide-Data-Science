WOW!  this does taste like a hoagie!  beware... it is RICH and filling!  you might spoil your dinner!  also, don't try to heat it up like i did... it separated.  it was a good idea while it lasted!  but, it was GREAT served cold as intended!

FANTASTIC! This recipe is easy to make and is both fun and original, definitely a crowd pleaser! I served it with both Ritz crackers and an Italian roll torn up into pieces and enjoyed both options. I will be making this again and again!

I waver between a 4 & 5 for this. It's very good, altho I thought the oregano was a bit overpowering so added a little more mayo to tame it. It's strange to think of these flavors as a dip. We ended up making sandwiches with the leftovers. lol.

Delicious and really does taste like a hoagie! I did not add the American cheese and I think I would reduce the amount of bologna next time as we thought it overpowered the other flavors a bit. Also, used less oregano than called for. Definitely a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

It's a MANLY dip!  I skipped the bologna & American cheese and the veggies because I dislike soggy veggies.. And added an additional 1/4lb ham & 1/4lb provolone. I used the mayo but also added about 1/2 cup of sour cream to loosen it up a bit, and mixed in 1Tbsp of so of red vinegar before serving. The dip was served with Stacy's simply salted pita chips.  OOOOOHHH YUMMM,

I grew up eating hoagies in Philadelphia and for a dip it's really good.

This dip sure packs a lot of flavor into a small bite and was very different from the usual potluck offerings, but you really need to chop everything very small or it tends to not stick together and fall off whatever your trying to put it on.

Made it for a potluck at work. Got RAVE reviews. Served with ritz crackers and mini pita pockets cut in half. Someone suggested that i could have stuffed the pita pockets and served it as a finger food. good idea, lots more work involved, but good idea if someone wants to invest the time.

This was YUMMY and a nice change from the usual appetizers. I did make variations with what I had on hand and to add a bit more flavor. I did not use bologna...not a fan. I used chopped ham, diced salami, and diced cajun spiced deer stick. I used olive oil mayo and added some creamy italian dressing (1/2 cup or so). I also used some onion powder and celery salt. It was a hit! Will make it again for sure. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Yummy! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I left out the oregano & sprinkled a bit of onion powder in. I also mixed the chopped tomatoes (I used a few firm, tiny plumb tomatoes that were easy to dice.) & the lettuce right in. I served it with sliced Italian bread. Next time I will add some finely diced purple onion. Thanks for the recipe! It's a great alternative to cheese & cracker for football Sundays!
