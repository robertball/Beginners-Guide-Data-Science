My husband and I loved this recipe.  THe only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it took a bit longer than 30 minutes - the pluots didn't want to cook down into a "thick sauce" - I ended up "helping" by mashing the fruit up with a wooden spoon after about 15 minutes

If you are a fan of tart and savory, this one is for you. While the pork was great, no one in the family cared for the tart sauce that came from our sweet sweet fruit. Bummer, so sorry. It wasn't for us.

Very simple to make and really delish. The pluots must be in season or they will not cook down well. They will be too tart. This is a summer dish.
