This was a great carrot recipe - I used whole carrots,  chopped into pieces (into three lengthwise, and each into quarter lengths), and roasted them for much less time than indicated. They were in the oven at 425 degrees for 10 minutes, I added the balsamic and let cook 4 minutes more.

I love the flavors here - I had never thought to do balsamic on my carrots! I didn't follow the proportions exactly. I used whole carrots and sliced them into thick rounds, tossed in EVOO, sprinkled with kosher sea salt and roasted at 425 for 30 minutes. When serving, I just drizzled them with a little balsamic. Very nice! An easy way to mix up roasted veggies!

Great recipe but next time I might add some fresh thyme or something like that to make the flavor a little more complex.  My husband loved these.

Loved this recipe!  So easy!  I also threw in some broccoli florets just because I had them.  My husband's exact quote was, "If vegetables tasted like this as a child my mother wouldn't have had to fight me to eat them!"  Thanks for sharing!

I had some very small whole carrots (wide as a baby but about 5 inches long) We did them on the top grill rack in foil for about an hour at 350-375. It wasn't what we were expecting but it was okay. The balsamic seemed to diminish the carrot flavor without adding enough flavor itself. They were good but I think we would prefer adding the balsamic at the table or leaving it out altogether.

This is my new favorite way to cook carrots.  I made it as-written last night for my son and myself. We liked it so much that I quadrupled the recipe tonight. I found that I don't need to roast the carrots as long as it says. I use regular carrots, peeled and cut to relatively the size of baby carrots. I don't use quite the amount of balsamic as called for.  I just give the carrots a good sprinkling, mix it up and roast 5 more minutes or so.  Yum!

I made this recipe as advised. I kept the balsamic vinegar off of one half of the pan, just to compare it to the carrots that were merely seasoned with the first three ingredients. They were better without the balsamic vinegar, in my opinion. I also needed the entire 40 mins for the carrots, and they still could have stood to come out softer, but they were starting to look wilted.

Not bad. Agree that the balsamic really only adds a bit of a twang to the carrots. I made this with some really thick carrots that I halved lengthwise, and they were done in about 45 minutes. Thanks anyway!

Everything was great until the balsamic vinegar went on and it just drowned the flavor of the carrots.

I'm not usually a big fan of cooked carrots but this recipe changed my mind.  It's super easy to prepare, healthy, and delicious! The roasting time called for in the recipe is too long.  (The first time I made these they burned).  Instead I roasted for 15 minutes, then added the balsamic and roasted 10 minutes more.  Perfection!

Simple to make and very delicious!  At 20 min, the carrots were done, so next time I will check to turn them at about 15 min.  All ovens are different!  Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Delicious and slightly tangy. The only change I made was to use 1 T. balsamic vinegar. I will definitely make carrots like this again.

These were delicious.  I roasted in the toaster oven and drizzled with balsamic glaze (I was out of balsamic vinegar), good combo of salty and slight sweetness and the texture was so much better than steamed (my usual way of cooking carrots).  This could become a regular side-dish in our family.

Easy peasy! Loved it! Instead of wasting a plastic storage baggy I just brushed the carrots with the oo, salt and pepper on the foil lined pan. Next time I may add some mint!

Everyone loves this - its become our go-to for carrots. I don't really like carrots but I crave them this way! (I probably add a little garlic to the pre-toss). My family actually REQUESTS this! And it's so easy!

Great  Flavors. Added pearl onions to the roast and they made a wonderful sweet addition to the balsamic glaze.

I usually don't roast my carrots, I don't especially care for the sweetness it brings out.  The balsamic perfectly cuts that and gives it a nice balance with a little twang.  This is a new household favorite!

My husband dislikes carrots, period! But this recipe really surprised him....he liked it! in fact, he loved it. We used baby carrots but did not have enough to measure out 4-5 cups.  My suggestion: if you do not have all the carrots called for, just cut back a smidge on the olive oil. And if you h ave any leftovers, they are great in soup.

We all loved it, could have made more for sure. Never saw the kids fight over the last of the carrots before! I did use Balsamic glaze instead of just the vinegar. I find it sweeter and stands up to roasting better plus I had it in the house. I am sure it would be just as good with just regular balsamic. Thanks for the recipe!

great carrots with just the right amount of Balsamic taste. I'm going to try them next time with a 1/2 tsp of soy sauce.

I needed to use my bag of whole carrots before we left town. I washed and cut them into 3-5 inch pieces. Tossed with the oil, sprinkled with garlic herb mix and baked, tossed with the balsamic vinegar. Perfect!  We loved it!

Very simple and so pretty and best of all, delicious! I used a bunch of full sized carrots and cut them smaller. Cooked a little faster. I'll make this again!

This was a great way to change up carrots without adding unnecessary ingredients. I used a high quality oil & honey balsamic vinegar with sea salt and fresh ground black pepper. I didn't follow exact measurements. I drizzled the oil and vinegar over the carrots and sprinkled with salt & pepper. I kept turning the carrots to keep the moist. This recipe was so easy and full of flavor. They turned out like candied carrots. Definitely a keeper!

While I could not taste this dish due to a stuffy nose, I tried this recipe for dinner with my parents and they really enjoyed it.  I did, however, add thinly sliced white onions and baked the carrots/onion/vinegar mix for almost an hour as I enjoy softer carrots, periodically adding water so as not to burn.  A simple dish and such a hit.

Just loved this recipe.  Used regular carrots as we do not enjoy baby carrots.  put in small roasting pan and covered while baking.  Will make again.

While I loved the idea, the recipe definitely did not turn out as described in the reviews.  The carrots were still hard after cooking for the recommended time, and the balsamic flavor was reduced to an amorphous, anonymous tang, rather than the full richness it is capable of. I rated this two stars because the done-ness may very well be because I had a smaller baking dish, and the carrots were layered two deep, but the lack of flavor surprised me.

Wow, these were really good!! Since we were cooking out, I made these on the grill instead of in the oven, and they turned out just fine.  I thought my son, who typically hates cooked carrots, would like these, but he didn't, so that's why I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5.  Oh well, that means more left over for me!!

Easiness rating is a 5. I used whole carrots that I cut into large pieces. Then I used the same bag that the carrots came in to toss them in vinegar and oil. I don't like single use plastic, but this made coating the carrots and clean up extra easy.

This was good, a little different flavor but still good.  It's worth a try as a healthy no-sugar option for carrots. I liked it a lot.

The recipe was excellent as written. I made some with balsamic and some without. Both ways were very tasty. I don’t really see the need for the vinegar, but it does add just a hint of acidity.

I made this recipe using only carrots as the vegetable because I wanted to use them while they were fresh. They were delicious. Normally my husband doesn't care for roasted vegetables, but even he complimented the taste without being asked for an opinion. The only other thing I changed was to add a teaspoon of melted butter to the marinade.

Chopped a couple of fresh carrots into thirds and then quartered the thirds.  I most likely had less carrots then what is called for in the recipe but followed the measurements for all other ingredients as stated anyways.  The carrots were good and had quite a bit of "tang" to them.  I probably wont make these very often but they were really good and I will for sure make them again.

Loved this dish.  Used carrots with tops (trimmed to 2") and drizzled with balsamic reduction & turned them a couple of times resulting in some browned, candied streaks. Served them in a white dish for company. Leaving the slender carrots whole was attractive and everyone loved them.

I thought these were okay. I followed the recipe exactly except for peeling and halving my own carrots. I have never been a fan of balsamic vineger and this recipe was no exception. It never imparts flavor to recipes I add it, but it does cause a browning color I don't care for. The carrots didn't have much flavor and the texture on some was slightly on the rubbery side.

I used golden carrots instead of orange, so I'm not sure if that had a huge impact on the taste.  I thought they tasted very similar to beets, which I hate.  My husband and kids loved them.

Made this recipe tonight with red/purple skinned carrots....after roasting them, they tasted more like amazing sweet potatoes than carrots! They were simply delicious!  A real keeper!

We love this recipe!  I just pour the vinegar on, but I'd guess I probably double the the amount of balsamic vinegar, since my husband is a vinegar nut.  An easy, healthy side dish.  Thanks for sharing!
