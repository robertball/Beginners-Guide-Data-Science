Chef John always wins in our kitchen! Made these for our new years Eve party and they were a huge hit. Will definitely make them again. Very easy to make. Only change I made was didn't put in blue cheese (personally not a big fan) and added another ounce of cream cheese. Amazing! Thanks chef John!

Easy and amazing. I baked the rolls at 425 for 10 minutes and they turned our crunchy, just as if I had fried them. Yum!

As usual Chef John hit another home run, wife loved these and we will be making them many more times. the right amount of filling to wrap and they are so crisp and crunchy.
