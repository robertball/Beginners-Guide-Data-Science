This green sauce should come with a disclaimer, this is HOT. I only had habaneros on hand so I used 5 habaneros to make up for the ghost peppers. I can only imagine what the heat would be if I used ghost peppers. There is something about this sauce that makes you keep wanting to go back for more, must be the endorphin's kicking in. Make sure you store it in a heat proof bowl. This is good on anything, it's even good on ice cream.

I've made this sauce multiple times, and I love it more and more every time that I make it. Definitely add the optional ghost peppers if you like heat. SUCH a great flavor in this sauce. Excellent spread on a turkey sandwich.
