This is a great recipe but a bit bland. I followed the recipe verbatim and will definitely make this again but with some additions. I recommend using twice the amount of cumin and oregano as well as an additional can of green chiles. Thanks for a good addition to my recipe collection!

Only thing I changed is that I used 5lbs of thighs instead of whole chicken.  I added a large can of broth instead of boullian.  Ok I also added extra garlic and chillies but that's because I added a lot of broth and chicken.

This chili was very tasty! 
I modified the recipe a bit by adding celery and sautéeing it beforehand with the onion and garlic.
I also added 1/2 a chopped jalapeño, black pepper, and 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder to the chili.
I left out the hominy simply bc the store was out.
IT WAS YUMMY GOOD! 
And, even my kiddos loved it!

It is good.  I added one can of Hatch "hot" green chilis, an extra clove of garlic and a few other spices.  Overall, it is very tasty.  I made it tonight to serve for Halloween
