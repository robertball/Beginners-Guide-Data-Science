Everyone loves this, it's addictive.  Some hints, when doing the butter/graham crust, add 1/4 teasp. cinnamon. Melt butter in a pot on stove, then stir in the graham crackers, then put it in the pan and press it down evenly. This way, the crust stays together much better than just sprinkling it.

I used a combination of chocolate chips and butterscotch chips, and walnuts.  I pre-mixed these along with the coconut, and poured the mixture over the condensed milk.  My daughter who absolutely HATES nuts, and my son who isn't especially fond of coconut, couldn't stay away from these.  Nobody could!  These easy things were the holiday favorites at the parties I took them to, and it made me wish I hadn't wasted my time on all the other difficult desserts I also brought (and ended up bringing back home).

I *would not* line the pan with foil--I believe it would tear when cutting and get stuck in the cookie bars.  Eeww.  I used a glass dish *without* greasing it first, and it wasn't a bad clean-up at all.  Do chill the bars before cutting, and cut the bars into SMALL servings, as a little goes a long way with this super-rich recipe.

I definitely would mix the graham crackers and melted butter next time, pressing them firmly into the pan, and then greasing the dish might be a good idea.  I might also try semi-sweet chocolate chips, as this recipe is ultra-sweet.

I mixed the crumbs into the butter before patting it into the pan.  Also, I wish I had added the nuts before the coconut so the nuts wouldn't taste roasted.  Other than that, this was a simple recipe and it was a good combination of flavors.  The sides didn't stick much to the pan, but next time, I'll try the foil and spray as suggested for easier cleanup.

My older sister made these about 20 years ago for Christmas, and I have made them every year since! They are a always a big hit at the office and at holiday gatherings. I usually make a slightly thicker crust, but other than that, follow the recipe faithfully. And yes, these are VERY rich...so cut into small bars.

Tip: Mix the chips nuts and coconut together in a mixing bowl and then press into pan...more evenly distributes all the ingredients..

These are fabulous. However, I increased the crust to 2 1/2 cups of crumbs and added a little more butter to the original recipe. I also added 1/2 cup of white choco-chips and reduced the amount of nuts. It really has to cool before being cut or it makes a mess. They freeze very well, especially if left uncut.

I volunteered to bring something for our annual Christmas bazaar for church - even though I don't bake much any more.  These were so easy to make!  I used the version with 1/2 chocolate chips and 1/2 butterscotch.  The ladies in the kitchen that were packaging the baked goods tasted them and said they were great.  It seems that a lot of people know what they are because they sold right away.  If you want better directions for the same recipe look for the site that says 7 layer Magic Bars by Eagle brand - they seem to have improved the directions for that recipe.

This has always been a favorite of mine since I was young. When I left the States in 1974 and settled in Australia my biggest problem was that I couldn't get graham crackers, so I substituted a "Coffee" biscuit. This worked fine. The only other change I make is to pour the condensed milk over all the layers just before I put it in the oven. This seems to bind everything together and the top then turns a lovely golden brown when cooked. This is always a hit at any gathering.

My kids went crazy for these, very sweet and chocolately.  The crust was a little tricky for me though, I don't understand why the butter needs to be melted in the oven?  Next time I'll just put it in the microwave, mix in the crumbs and press into the pan:)

I made this recipes with 1/2 chocolate chips and 1/2 reeses peanut butter morsels mix and it was outstanding. I also found it helpful to press down on the bars with a spatula before baking, this makes it settle better. For a quick clean up, line the pan with aluminum foil and spray the foil with PAM.

Pretty good. Next time I will mix the butter and crumbs together and press into the pan to prevent it from crumbling. I also should have waited until they had chilled before slicing into them, they would have held their shape a little better.

Made the recipe AS-IS, and am rating it as such!  People shouldn't rate their own recipe variations, it defeats the purpose since you aren't actually rating the recipe (steps off soap box, lol).  That being said: I actually found this recipe on the back of the Eagle Brand condensed milk and decided to make it.  The second time around I did make some changes: 1. It says to smash everything down with a fork.  Well, when I did it the first time it looked nothing like the pictures, more like smashed-flat bars.  So this time around I saved about 1/4 cup of coconut flakes and 1/4 cup of chocolate chips at the end.  I smashed the rest of it down with my hands (not a fork), and then LOOSELY layered the remaining coconut and chocolate chips.  Looked picture-perfect!  2.  The recipe says to pour evenly, but of course be sure to use a spatula to make sure the condensed milk is TRULY even.  3. Put the nuts UNDERNEATH the coconut/chocolate layers to keep them from 'roasting'.  You want them baked instead.  4. When doing the crumbs, the first time I left quite a few 'large chunks' in there.  Bad idea.  Make sure to smash those graham crackers down so they are like sand particles, as tiny as can be!!  The second time around I smashed them a lot more and it was a lot easier to spread (put them in a baggie and smash away if you don't have a chopper). 5. Melt butter in a pot then add the crumbs, works perfect.  Best of luck! :)

To make  clean up even easier, melt the stick of butter in the preheating oven right in the 9x14 pan you are going to use to bake the squares in.  Then just add the crumbs to the pan and mix and press.....no other mixing bowl needed.  This also eliminates the step of greasing the pan.

Great recipe, easy to make, but I would like to point out that the amount of graham cracker crumbs is in no way enough for a 13x9 pan (which is strange, because the rest of the recipe seems to be for that size except the crust). It's enough for a 9x9. So if you want to make it better, use at least 2 cups of crumbs (2.5 would be perfect I think) and I would use just a tiny bit more butter, not to scale because the way the recipe is originally makes for a VERY greasy crust and that's not great, nor does it hold together very well.  Another big tip: premix all the ingredients that go on the crust in advance, then spread them over. It makes for a more uniform filling and easier to spread over the crust.

This has been a holidy favorite in my family since I can remember. The only thing we do differently is that we put all the "toppings" in and then drizzle the condensed milk over the whole pan before baking. It seems to help glue all those chips together, and makes the bars less crumbly.

When I started helping my mom make these bars 40 years ago, they were called, Dippy-Chippy Bars and everyone LOVED them!! The crust was much easier back then as the recipe called for the Graham crackers to be left whole and fitted into the bottom of the pan. Then melted butter was poured over the top. The rest of the recipe was the same and used butterscotch chips as well. When the bars were done, you did not notice any gaps left by mis-matched cracker edges as the condensed milk and butter settles into the crackers and makes this wonderful carmelish glue that holds it all together!! Much easier than messing with crumbs!

I found when I poured the condensed milk on the graham cracker crumbs, that the first time when I tried to spread it, it just made a mess. The second time, I poured the condensed milk out of the can and spread it by pouring it in strips kind of, and it spread out on its own. This method worked much better than trying to spread it!

I just think these cookies have way too many chocolate chips.  If you reduce the chocolate chips to 1 and 1/4 cups it is much better and then worthy of five stars, but not as is.

Loved this recipe!...was a hit with family and friends. Increased the butter to 3/4 cup and the cracker crumbs to 2 1/4 cups for a 13x9 dish and that made a nice thick base which was easy to pack down and cut with out crumbling.

Here is how I made these and they turned out Excellent.  I used 2c of cracker crumbs, 1/2c butter (melted and mixed w/crumbs) pressed into a lined (parchment) 13x9.  I then used half a bag of Butterscotch chip however I used my food processor to size them down to a crumb slightly chunky mixture so they wouldn't be too overpowering and sweet.  I put the condensed milk into the microwave to warm for 15 seconds, with this thinned warmed milk i poured half onto the crust, then put on the mini semi sweet chips (half bag) the crumbly butterscotch chips, on top of the chips I drizzled some of the milk then applied the coconut to the top of that to give something to adhere too.  I pressed this all down and then added the rest of the milk to the top of the coconut.  Last I added a light sprinkling of coconut to the top (I love the browned toasted coconut) and a few scatters of mini chips.  Baked 325 (glass pan) for 25 minutes, let cool 2 hours.  Perfect and each bar was not filled with an overwhelming butterscotch or chocolate taste, perfect blend!  Wonderful

No need for the extra graham cracker crumbs--

Use the suggested crust, then mix together the chocolate chips, coconut and nuts (I use pecans) spread the mixture evenly over the crust and lastly drizzle the can of sweetened condensed milk evenly over the top. Done this way, the recipe comes out perfectly.  

Yes, definitely let it cool and chill before cutting.

This definitely is an old fasioned favorite! And, there's really virtually nothing you can do to screw it up. It's not like there's any complicated directions or measuring here. It's straightforward and all the ingredients come together to compliment each other. I crushed my graham crackers by putting them into a ziploc bag and going over them with a rolling pin. I used a throw away tin to bake these in that I sprayed with a little Pam. I follwed the recipe exactly and you can substitute white chocolate chips or butterscotch for half the amount of semisweet chocolate if you want to change it up a bit. These were so easy and oh so delectable!

Words cannot express how much I LOVE these bars. My mom and I first made them almost 20 years ago and since I've been old enough to bake on my own, I can only let myself make them at Christmas, too dangerous to have around the house more often. Even my brother who doesn't really like coconut eats too many of these. Just one little tip to share - on the tattered ripped-out-of-a-magazine copy of this recipe that I have, the method is very slightly different. It calls for the putting the 1/2 cup butter in the pan and sticking it in the hot oven to melt, then sprinkling the crumbs over the melted butter, mixing together and patting down to form the crust. Really doesn't make a difference to the finished product but saves using another dish to melt the butter in and mix the crumbs in, and no need to grease the pan.

This is a recipe my grandma used, but there is a slight issue with the ordering. My grandma always poured the butter in the bottom of the pan first to grease it and just poured the graham crackers on top and pushed down with a fork. Then she would put down the morsels, then the nuts, and then the coconut. Finally she would pour the sweetened condensed milk over top of it all and bake it till golden brown. They were so good. The way posted here was not as well stuck together. It tended to fall apart more than I would have liked, but overall still a good recipe.

This is a recipe from my childhood! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that one step seemed off from the way my mom and grandma always did it, but I followed the recipe anyway...mistake.  DO NOT add the milk until last step, pour it over ALL the ingredients, not just the crust...doing it this way binds it all together, following the recipe as listed makes the crust mushy and leaves all the toppings loose and crumbly.

Absolutely excellent! I didn't change anything. I typically use half walnuts, half pecans and it comes out amazing. If you want a crisper, more substantial crust, I would do one and half times the cookie crumbs (and add some extra butter).  Right now, the crust is pretty thin and comes out more like a chewy cookie layer than a crust. That's completely preference though. The recipe is fine just the way it is. The only problem is that you'll want to eat the whole pan in one sitting!

I double this recipe.  After the first layer I start  over starting with the graham cracker crust. Way more calories, but man are they good!  My mom made them for me when I was a little girl and now I have been making them for about 25 years! It is my favorite holiday desert.

This recipe is nostalgic...and devine. Making magic layer cookie bars is an art of its own kind. First, let me start by saying I have always eaten the variation kind, where 1 cup of chocolate chips is substituted with butterscoth. 
 The substitution adds so much more depth and chemistry to the bar. It ties with the coconut like a match made in heavena and keeps the flavor from being a monotonous overpowering chocolate. 
 Secondly, the crust is a holy layer in itself. DO NOT cut the bars when they are hot. You will create a DISASTER. Chill the bars in the fridge for a while and the crust will be firm, still delicate, but not rock hard. 
 Overall, the combination of sweet, creamy and just slightly salty is an amazing experience. The textures as well are insane.

This is a good recipe if you do the following:
--use unsalted butter (the salt in the butter comes out too much)
--don't forget to press everything firmly before pouring condensed milk
--split the condensed milk half over crumb base and other half over all ingredients. (don't pour all at the end as others have suggested, you need to adhere the bottom and the top layer
--increase the crumbs to about 2 1/2
--wait until it's cooled entirely before cutting

The base is pretty crumbly still, not sure how to keep it firm.

These magic bars/hello dolly bars have been a Christmas family tradition ever since I can remember & I'm a 60s child! From my experience....Melt the 1/2 cup of butter in the pan in the oven AND then press the graham cracker crumbs into the melted butter ***skip the foil***  I prefer the combination 1 cup of dark chocolate and 1 cup peanut butter chips.  Also use chopped mixed nuts instead of the walnuts.   These pass the "yum" test !

this is an awesome recipe i have used for years.  the thing loved most about THIS one is the advice from others.  here's what i did:   i added another 1/4 cup butter, 3/4 cup crumbs and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon to the crust.  i lined my dish with foil and sprayed with cooking spray.  i used semi-sweet, bittersweet, peanut butter and butterscotch chips.   i finely chopped (not to dust!) the nuts.  i pressed/packed everything down before baking.  when finished baking, i let it cool completely and then put into the fridge to harden.  THEN, i cut into diamonds.  NO MESS! nothing fell apart and the nuts and coconut were perfect.   my son said it was my best version, and everyone at the bbq he took them to loved them!  thanks so much everyone for working together.  imagine what we all could do on bigger issues!!

I have been making this recipe for over 20 years.  Adults and children love them.  Everyone who tries them wants the recipe and can't get over   how easy it is to make.  I use to make two pans of them for office during the holidays they would  last maybe 15 minutes they were always the first item on the tray of goodies to disappear. Everyone would ask me if there were anymore of them. I highly recommend this recipe. I have tried all kinds of different variations of this recipe they are all good. Rating 5 plus stars

I have made this recipe many times and it always turned out great.  However, this time I followed this recipe which says to pour the condensed milk over the graham cracker crumbs and then follow with chips, coconut, etc.  I wound up with cookies that are falling apart.  The correct way is to assembled the bars and then pour the milk over the top.

We didn't care for this one at all.  It just tasted like melted chocolate chips stuck on top of a buttery layer (which is pretty much what it was).  Over the top rich and nothing special to us.

This recipe calls for too much coconut flakes.  I didn't use all it called for and it was still too much: it's all I really tasted.  They hold up good and look nice, but if you used all the coconut it requires you might not enjoy them as much as you would if you scaled it back a bit.

LOVE THESE! Two hints for making it easier. Melt the butter in the pan and then stir the graham crackers crumbs in. Then you don't mess up another pot or pan. Also, add the sweetened condensed milk last. This helps stick everything together and doesn't make the crust soggy.

A cookie swap must!  These go faster tban lightening!!  Variations: use white choclate with dollups of raspberry preserves, or I use an oreo cookie base with peppermint oil added.  Another, use bittersweet chips to play off the richness and add depth to chocolate flavor.

One of our favorite picnic desserts. This is not the original recipe though -- original calls for adding the condensed milk LAST. Do it! You won't be disappointed.

My family and friends would give this 10 stars. Very rich candy cookie. We left out coconut, used milk chocolate chips and added a few more finally chopped pecans. Could not make them fast enough.

This recipe was passed to me by my sister-in-law and are a holiday staple. One slight difference though, I add 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 cup butterscotch chips. Chopped walnuts are the nut of choice for me. They are so rich and delicious. And extremely easy to make. A big hit every time!

Love this treat. I put the the chips down, then the nuts, then coconut, and do the condensed milk last.    And as others have said, mix the graham cracker crumbs with the melted butter and pat down.

I've been making these for years... one of my favorites! A couple of hints - put stick of butter in pan, in oven, while preheating. Butter melts directly in pan. Then sprinkle Graham crumbs over melted butter. Saves dirtying another pan or dish!  Second, my original recipe said to pour milk over everything, as last layer. I think all the other ingredients stick together better when the milk is poured on top and runs down through everything.

I melt the butter in the 9 x 13 dish while I am crushing the graham crackers. Then add the graham crackers to the butter, mix  together add chips, coconut and nuts and add the sweetened condensed milk last it's better that way.  This way it settles through all of the items not just the crust on the bottom.

I LOVE these cookies!  Have been making them since I was a kid. Definitely use real butter with the graham cracker crumb crust.  I melt the butter in the pan in the oven as it preheats.  No need for cooking spray! Then just sprinkle the crumbs into the melted butter and continue on with your layers!

I melt the butter in the pan in the oven and add the graham cracker crumbs right in the pan.  

This is the best and easiest dessert ever!  My mom used to make these when I was a child.  And I'm  old now!

The first time my mom made these for me was in the 5th grade (1989!). We've made these ever since - usually for special occasions (Thanksgiving, Christmas, Eid) or any sort of potluck. These are truly a favorite classic. I've always mixed the melted butter and graham crackers and pressed them down (pack it tight) so that it's not crumbly. Sometimes I'll add all the chocolate chips, nuts and coconut first, then add the condensed milk, sometimes I'll do it the other way around. Make sure to push the goodies down with a fork if you put the condensed milk down first. I haven't found a difference in taste/texture/ooziness etc. like some people claim. I do like to use a mixture of semi-sweet and milk chocolate and I like to mix all the chips, nuts and coconut flakes in a bowl first then sprinkle on top of my bars.  I don't know if it evenly distributes the stuff, but I like to think it does :)

Whats not to love?  I used extra graham cracker crumbs and butter because I thought the bottom layer was a little too thin.  I also used a combination of semi-sweet chocolate chips and butterscotch chips.  These bars are so easy and yet they receive rave reviews every time.  I also line my baking dish with aluminum foil which  is then sprayed with non-stick spray.  It makes it a snap to remove the bars from the pan and then to cut into perfect pieces.

Yum, came out just like when I was a kid! I followed the tip to mix the crumbs & butter in the pan on the stove before transferring to the pan- I had done recipes in the past that said to sprinkle it on & always had problems w/ the crust.  I omitted nuts & added some toffee bits for a little extra flavor.

I am really confused. 1.5 cups of graham crackers IMO will not fit into a 13x9 pan. Am I supposed to add more graham cracker crumbs? Also, it turned out to be gooey and mushy, which wasn't bad, but not hard like a COOKIE bar, which was what I expected. I wanted to put flour in it or something lol. Maybe I did it wrong, but I just did what the recipe called for. And I only put half of the condensed milk bc one full can is WAY TOO MUCH without weighing down the meager amount of crumbs unless that's what you're supposed to do. Just wasn't sure about this one but I did get lots of compliments and it went nicely w/ a bundt cake. Any suggestions??

Graham cracker crust needs to be doubled to fit well in a 13x9 pan. I doubled it and ended up then doubling the amount of sweetened condensed milk as well because I thought they were going to turn out "thin" overall. They turned out great! Used both semi-sweet and butterscotch chips.

mmm, delicious. Decreased the butter to 1/4 cup and used 3/4 cup milk choco chips and 1/2 cup butterscotch. Topped with mini marshmellows then drizzled with the swettened condensed milk. After baking drizzled with melted semi-sweet chocolate (like from the Rocky Road Bar from this site). Awesome:)

WHOO, SUGAR RUSH! These are so, so delicious - where have they been all my life? I made the 7 layer version with butterscotch chips. I did find the crust to be oily, so next time I'll either decrease the butter or increase the graham crumbs. These are super rich, so small squares are best!

I grew up with my mom making these and came on here for the recipe because she requested them for Thanksgiving and making them at 0130 in the morning I couldn't call her for the recipe. We leave out the nuts for nut-haters and they still taste great. When people want my mom to bring a dessert they request this one, even though she has no problem/is capable at making much more involved and complicated cookies and bars. This has graced my family's table as long as I can remember and it works very, very well for us. Thanks Eagle Brand :)

Another good variation, especially for Christmas, is to use white chocolate, dried cranberries, and sliced almonds for the toppings.  Really good and festive looking.  Also, when I need a variety of cookies, I will make one half the pan the traditional way, and the other half as above, or with butterscotch chips and walnuts.  Two cookie bars for the price of one.

These cookie bars are incredible. I make them a couple times around Christmas and people never fail to ask for the recipe.

(Even though I know that this recipe has been around for YEARS.)

I always double the graham cracker bottom to make a sturdier bottom for the rest of the cookie. I have been known to use peanuts in place of the nuts called for in the recipe.

I have been making this for years...with a little twist.  Instead of using graham wafer crumbs, I use Oreo cookie crumbs.  This gets rave reviews whenever I make it!

My family has made these bars for years & they are very sweet. I made a less sweet version & it turned out wonderful ( the crust did not fall apart!!!) Here is what I did to make a smaller & less sweet batch...Using a round cake pan, sprayed with cooking spray...melt 6 tbls. butter in saucepan. Stir in 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs. Press mixture into pan. Pour 1/2 can Eagle Brand over crumbs, layer with 1/2 cup UN-sweetened coconut, 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips & 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Bake at 325 for 25-30 minutes. Cool completely. Cut into bars. This way of making these held up wonderfully. They are a lot less sweeter than the original version.

My whole family loves these bars! This recipe has been around for over 20 years and it's a favourite Christmas treat. I never met a man who didn't love these. A couple things I do to make the process easier: while the oven preheats pop the pan in with the butter to melt it, the other is use a spatula to press it down because it's much more efficient than a fork. Oh and one last thing! The amounts of chocolate chips, coconut and nuts can vary. Use as much or as little as you like! :)

Meh.  Dad loved these, hubby and I were less than thrilled.  To be fair, we subbed peanuts for walnuts and peanut butter chips for chocolate (though this was a great switch if you like PB!).  The issue was the crust, just bleah, no flavor.  Next time, I'll try making my own graham cracker crumbs instead of using boxed ones, maybe get more flavor and texture.

This is the most addicting cookie bar I have ever had. I will substitute butterscotch chips and milk chocolate chips for the semi-sweet chocolate chips.  It is an easy recipe and it doesn't take long to make.

Very good recipe.  However, as I was mixing the butter with the graham crakers crumbs I could tell the ratios were off.  I only used about 1/2 of the recommended amount of butter and could tell that more was NOT needed.  It is silly to blindly follow a recipe when you can tell from experience that something is wrong with the listed quantities.  I can see what others said about it being greasy so fortunately I did NOT use that much butter.  A whole stick of butter will make a very greasy crust.  I did prebake the crust since this is much like a cheesecake crust.  There are also other recipes on AR that are nearly the same, so I had compared ingredients and read the reviews before starting.  Mix together all of the other dry ingredients and then place over the top of the milk.  Much easier then trying to layer them separately and the topping comes out more uniform.

These are great! Easy and delicious. I get asked for these all the time. I forgot to pour the Eagle milk at the right moment one time and just poured it on at the end (before baking) and we liked it better that way so that's how I do it now.

These bars have always been one of my favorites, now with a son who is allergic to all milk products I have become the improv queen....Dairy free version is outstanding!!!! I use homemade sweetened condensed milk or Coco Lopez cream of coconut, Sunspire chocolate chips(dairy free) and unsalted Fleishman's margarine is dairy free!! No one ever knows they are milk free.

LOVE these. They were such a hit among friends at a recent party. I didn't have store bought crumbs, so I made my own by using my favorite graham crackers from Trader Joe's (adds a nice touch of cinnamon) and mashed them into pieces in a plastic bag.  I used 2 cups of crumbs and slightly increased the butter and pressed it into the bottom of the pan.  They were perfect!

These magic cookies bars are a hit with everyone I have ever made them for. I actually make the recipe slightly different. I use the same graham cracker crumb bottom. Then I mix the sweetened condensed milk with the coconut (and nuts if you want) and then bake it for 20 minutes. Once it is ready, I put the chocolate chips on top, let them melt and spread them over the bar. Very delicious!

These are so good and very easy to make! After reading other reviews, I used more graham cracker crumbs and butter to make a thicker crust. I mixed them together and then pressed them in the bottom of the baking dish. I mixed the other ingredients together too before spreading them over the crust. It came out great.

So simple and so good.  I make a bunch of "treats" around the holidays for my family and friends.  These are always in my box.  Everyone loves them and they are the easiest things I make.  I normally don't worry about measuring the nuts or coconut I just make sure the pan is evenly covered.  Wonderful.

I melt the butter in the pan and then I press down the Graham Cracker Crumbs.  I then top with morsels, nuts, coconut and then top with Eagle brand milk.  Layering it in that order kept the cookie together and still keeps the recipe simple.

This has been my favorite cookie bar since I was a small child. One reviewer said to reduce the chocolate chips and I strongly disagree. I actually ADD choc chips until the entire pan is sufficiently covered. Sometimes I make with nuts but since my family is not a big nut in a cookie fan, I usually don't and these are always the first cookies to go. ALWAYS. Just remember to coll fully before cutting into bars, but you should run a knife around the edges of the pan right when it comes out of the oven.

These are delicious.  The BEST squares ever.  I prefer to layer the coconut/walnuts/chocolate chips and then I pour the can of sweetened condensed milk on top.  Oh and you definitely need to cook this in a smaller dish/pan (11 by 7) or you wont have enough graham cracker base!   And it's all a matter of personal preference, but I only use one cup of choc chips, one cup of coconut (unsweetened) and one cup of nuts.  It makes it easy to remember.

This is a fabulous recipe! Although, when I was going through my pantry this morning looking for the ingredients, I noticed I didn't have regular graham crackers. Instead, I crushed up cinnamon flavored Teddy Grahams! Wow, they tasted great in this recipe! In addition to the top layer, after it was baked and cooled, I drizzled a little caramel sauce on it, which added a nice touch and made it look even prettier. This recipe is pretty versatile, but my additions turned out delicious. Yum!

I have been making these layered bar cookies for my son since he was 8 or 9 years old.  He is now turning 30 in January and he is engaged to be married! He is still asking for them. This year I am teaching my beautiful future daughter in-law how to make them a long with other Christmas treats that have been a tradition in our house for many years. Nicole, (my future DIL) has never had any Christmas traditions growing up.  Her beautiful eyes keep lighting up like a little girl.
***These cookies are spectacular. I have never changed how I have made them in the 25 plus years I have made them for Christmas.

I've been making these for years and here's a few tips you must follow for these to work best:
1. Pour the sweetened condensed milk over the crumbs, THEN the chocolate chips, THEN the nuts, THEN the coconut. You could also use marshmallows instead of coconut. 
2. Don't forget to press them down with a fork before baking!!

Everyone I know loves these. My mom used to make these when my siblings and I were young, and she would make them for school bake sales and brunches, etc. I have never cared for them, but I really am the only one it seems! Lol These are very rich and filling. If you love the individual ingredients of this recipe, I think you will be wildly impressed. Some other reviewers said there was too much chocolate; that's how I feel, also. The chocolate chips seem so overpowering, but nobody in my family has complained about that. Big hit recipe!

I had about an hour to throw together a dessert and these are so quick and easy to make. I made three batches and took them to a party - they were all gone in about an hour. I got a ton of compliments on them and had several people ask me for the recipe. I'd say they were a definite success. This one is going into my recipe box for future use on the fly.

Tip #1: Cut the bars before refrigerating them. Do NOT refrigerate and then expect to cut it the next day. It was hard as a rock and I couldn't cut it. It was pretty decent immediately after baking it but the next day it was hardened and not so good.

This recipe brings back memories from my childhood.  I made as the recipe is written.  It's delicious & easy.  I think the only thing I would do different is press the crust down a little better as it fell apart a bit.

I followed some of the advice of others. I bought my items at the bulk barn if i didn't already have them. I used 2 cups of graham crumbs and mixed it with the melted butter (microwaved) first then patted it into the pan. then added about 3/4 of the condensed milk, then about 1 1/2 cups of chopped walnuts. Then mixed together in a bowl the coconut (1/2 sweetened 1/2 not) with 1 cup of chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of peanut butter chips (because I had them). sprinkled that mixture on top and drizzled the entire thing with the 1/4 of the condensed milk I had left.
wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks all!

Have made this recipe for years but haven't made it in a long while. The family raved like I had never made it before. Did add toffee chips as an added crunch and only made it better. Will not wait so long to make again.

I use organic, unsweetened shredded coconut for these, so much more flavor with less sweetness.  I also mix the melted butter and graham crumbs and press into pan.  Split the condensed milk, half against the crust and half over the top.  Much better overall result.

Amazingly easy recipe. I love that there are no eggs, sugar, flour, etc. & you don't have to have the measurements exactly right; for instance, I used only one cup of chocolate chips and thought that was PLENTY. Also, I pushed the graham cracker crust up slightly onto the sides of the baking dish so that not only is it on the bottom, but on the sides of the bars as well. Enjoy!

I used to get this recipe off the back of a box of sweetened crushed corn flakes made for fish batter. a billion different names for a wonderful bar cookie. I did chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, butterscotch chips, coconut flakes, and slivered almonds on 1/2. just use handful amounts and sprinkle what ever you like! ALWAYS amazing!

Very tasty, but I didn't like how the nuts tasted roasted and crunchy after coming out of the oven - next time I would leave out the nuts just because I didn't like the texture. Also, it was a little messy to cut, with a lot of the toppings coming off easily.

I have also made this recipe every year for nearly 3 decades! My aunt used to make this and now my mom and I make them all the time.  We actually pour the condensed milk over the top of the entire layered cookie--saving it the end.  It makes the cookies taste candied and then we freeze them before serving them.  Super delicious cold vs. room temp.

These are good BUT if you mix the choc chips with Butterscotch chips and put pecans on top and then bake it changes the whole taste for a 1000% better taste.  Try it

Delicious, but this recipe leaves them too crumbly.  

Mix butter and crumbs first (I use processor).

Put on chips, nuts, then coconut.  Drizzle the milk LAST so that it soaks all the toppings.  This creates a more solid bar and helps the coconut to brown to a nice crunch.

LOVE these cookies! They never disappoint. A few tips: Use the bottom of a heavy, flat drinking glass or a metal measuring cup to pat down the graham crackers evenly. I also use it again to pat down everything before placing in the oven.  Also, consider lining the pan with parchment paper. That way, you can remove everything at once when cooled, then cut the individual bars with an electric knife.

Delicious but I made the mistake of using salted butter - make sure to use unsalted butter or they taste quite salty.  Also, next time I will use more nuts and less chocolate chips as it was a little too sweet and gooey for me and I think the nuts would cut the sweetness of the condensed milk a little bit more.  I also think I could cut the butter down just a tad.

Fantastic recipe.  I baked mine in mini and regular sized muffin tins.  They turned out great.  I just had to adjust the baking time to 12-15 min for the mini ones and about 20 minutes for the regular sized muffins.  

I also used part butterscotch, semisweet, and white chocolate chips.  They were a hit!

Love these bars! They are So rich and a little goes a long way. I think these are one of my Dad's favorite desserts and I always make them for Christmas to give away. I like to use one cup of chocolate chips and one cup of butterscotch chips. Yum!!

Delicious! Doubled the crust but kept everything else the same and spread into a 9 x 11 pan.  I added the butterscotch chips for a 7 layer bar.  Sold at a charity bake sale and they flew off the plate!

My Variation ~ Double the recipe....bake in two 8x8 dollar store aluminum pans.  Use Nilla Vanilla Wafers crushed for crust, use one can dulce de leche milk (it's essentially caramel) and one can sweetened condensed milk.  Used macadamias and some white chips in addition to the chocolate.  I have never ever received this many sincere compliments on a variation of a trusted recipe.  Born of a 'only had this on hand' moment - I will keep the 2 kinds of milk and the remake of the crust for sure.

I had a relative who made these when I was a kid every holiday. It was also my first recipe I made in Home Economics class in junior high when we had to make a cookie or similar dessert. It is a very sweet cookie like bar that holds together very well. As a kid I remember I really liked them. But, as an adult they are little too rich and chocolaty for me. However, they are great for a "holiday party" and almost everyone seems to really like them.

Snaps for Eagle Brand! I don't think you can mess up this recipe, really. After the graham crackers are in the pan you can put the rest of the ingredients on in any order. I went with nuts, sweet milk, 3 kinds of chips, coconut and then sprinkled a few more chips and a few more nuts on. Baked it for 22 min. I did put parchment spayed with pam in the pan 1st. I cut them into 48 1 inch squares so they were pop in your mouth size, any bigger would be overkill on the sugar. Thanks we really like these.

This has been a holiday staple for years. They are always a big hit with the family or at gatherings. Instead of chocolate chips we use baking M&Ms. The colors just make them seem more festive for the holidays. We also leave out the nuts.

Perfect! I made this five times and it's always a big hit whenever I take this!
Also, I'm from Europe so I use "metric" option and don't know if it translate the measures very well, anyway I doubled graham crackers and add a little bit more of butter (but not double).

I often bring these to potlocks and they disappear instantly.  People seem to always ask who made the magic bars and give me lots of compliments.  I love to make them because the only pan I get dirty is the one I bake the bars in.  Very simple and tasty!

I hadn't made these in over 20 years...I adjusted the graham cracker crust to 2.5 cups and mistakenly put in 1 cup of butter instead of 1/2.  For the pan - I used parchment paper.  These turned out wonderful...the crust was thick and with the parchment paper came right out of the pan.

How can you not LOVE a recipe that you can put together on the morning of Christmas Eve and still have time for EVERYTHING else on your to-do list?? I've been making these since my first Christmas with my husband (29 years and counting!!) and they're still a winner!! Only suggestion is put the chocolate on LAST so it gets melty all over the rest of the ingredients. Quick and DELISH!!

These are amazingly easy to make!  I suggest mixing in butterscotch chips and chocolate chips.  Also, as someone else said, mix together the coconut, chips and nuts and then sprinkle over milk.  It helps a lot with even distribution.

Very tasty! I like to change up the crust sometimes and use crushed wafers or make a simple shortbread crust. I use both white and dark chocolate chips, and have also used butterscotch chips as well before. A chewy, easy-to-please, chocolatey snack.

These are a favorite from my childhood.  I remember helping my mother make them (just the chocolate chips, coconut, and chopped walnuts variation). I make a batch for my brother every Christmas. Make sure to allow to cool completely, even refrigerate, before cutting.

I didn't like this cookie.  First of all you need to do the butter and graham cracker bits like a cheesecake crust.  If you don't you have some places where the graham cracker doesn't make a bottom crust for the cookie.  Overall I thought the cookie was terrible.

I have been dying to make these and I finally did with a bit of disappointment.  My graham cracker crust didn't really form a solid layer and kind of crumbled apart.  Maybe I should have mixed it with melted butter and then pressed it into the bottom of the pan.  The taste was good because of the chocolate but nobody commented on them (except my husband who didn't really like them) or returned for seconds.

Yummy!!! Magic Cookie Bars have been a family favorite ever since I can remember. We've always stuck to the original recipe (as opposed to the variations listed), and we've never put the nuts in. These are guaranteed to be gone in less than a day, if the sweet tooth in your family runs as strong as it does in ours.

These are very good. I've been making these (minus the nuts) for years. We call them "power bars" :-) The only thing I did diff is mix the margarine with the graham crumbs and make it a packed down layer on the bottom (then add the rest of the layers). Great recipe!

Amazing. These were a hit. I followed it very closely but made the 7-layer magic bar variation. When combining the graham cracker crumbs and butter, melt the butter on the stovetop and stir in the crumbs until combined. Then press into the bottom of a 13x9 baking dish (I used spray to grease mine but probably not necessary). You think you won’t have enough crumbs to coat the bottom, but you will—just keep pressing. Then pour on most of the condensed milk, but leave a little to layer later. Then layer on 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, then 1 cup of butterscotch chips, then the flaked coconut (I used sweetened but I think you could use unsweetened). Then I pressed down slightly with a spatula to make sure the toppings adhered to the milk. Then drizzle the rest of the condensed milk on top. Added a pinch of sea salt over the top. Bake for 25-30 mins. Let cool in pan for 30 mins. Then cool in refrigerator. Once chilled, cut into small bars using a pizza cutter. They can be stored in an airtight container.

this is always delicious! a few adjustments: I used 2 1/2 cups of crumbs...2 cups of graham and 1/2 cups of crushed pecans with 1/2 cup of melted butter. I also used 1 1/2 cups of choc chips, but increased the nuts to  1 1/2 cups. the pecans in the crust and the roasted pecans on top made this bar even more awesome!

Be sure to mix graham crumbs and butter in a bowl. Not melting butter in baking fish and pouring crumbs over top. 
The finished result is just too crumbly that way. 
It's a great recipe for Easter if you dye the coconut. 
Enjoy!

This recipe is mouth-watering! I omit the chopped nuts and reduce the amount of chocolate chip.  I recommend doing this if you like to even out the flavor.  This is an amazing recipe for any party or just as a snack!

This recipe is always a favorite just make sure that you grease the sides, greasing the bottom isn't necessary  because of butter in the Graham  mixture.
 I used 2 cubes of butter and two packs of graham crackers.  Perfect to cover the bottom of a 133 x 9 pan.  I also used sliced almonds and OMG they were so good.  Do use semi sweet chips because the condensed milk is super sweet.  Love this!  It's always a hit and super easy.

My   Mom made these cookies every Christmas for many years creating a family favorite. She is no longer with us but her children, grandchildren, and great- grandchildren continue this tasty Christmas tradition! Her variation was that she used crushed corn flake crumbs for the crust and she layered the other ingredients before pouring the Eagle Brand milk over the top. She would use a rubber spatula to gently spread it around, being careful not going to the edges so it would be easier not to get it out of the pan later. I made a variation by using frosted corn flakes for the crust and this year I' m going to try it with chocolate wafer cookies for the chocoholics in my house!

I have been making these for years. Everyone loves them. My twist is I melt the butter in a pan, add about 1/4 cup maple syrup and combine w/ the graham cracker. I then press the mixture onto the pan, add the chocolate chips and then coconut, press all lightly  and then drizzle the sweetened condensed milk over the ingredients.

These are just the best. I mix in a spoonful of stevia and a spoonful of cocoa  when I mix the butter and the crumbs. Dark chocolate and butterscotch with a lot of coconut is my favorite(this year).Always easy and always good. A sure thing.

Very good. The only thing I would not use again are the nuts. I used chopped pecans and wasn't thrilled with the nutty aftertaste. Maybe next time I would use a salty nut, like peanuts, just for some flavor contrast. Otherwise, I would definitely make again.

So delicious! It is important that these cool completely before cutting them. I also recommend mixing the melted butter and graham cracker crumbs together, then pressing them into the pan. That make the crust really nice. I used a 9x9 pan because I wanted to crust a little thicker, and scaled back a bit on the toppings. These are very good right out of the fridge with a tall glass of cold milk. I plan to make them again, but I might use a little less butter in the crust, because it was a little oily. Overall, a great recipe.

These were pretty good! I mixed the sweet condensed milk with the cocnut instead of putting it directy on the gram crust.  Not sure if that was why the gram crust came out so crumbly. I may add a little extra butter to the gramcrust (mix the melted butter with the gram's before pressing into pan) and i may bake the crust for a few minutes prior to adding the coconut topping. All in All a very rich dessert.

My family loves this and all the variations we have made. (various chips, nuts, etc.) I have found that an extra Tblsp of sugar mixed in with the graham cracker crumbs helps keep the crust together.

I make these every year and they are always the first to be eaten from my cookie baskets. I usually bake the recipe as is. Substituting some choc chips for butterscotch and they are delicious but the original is a classic staple that is always a hit. Oh and to cheat I use a piazza cutter to slice them onto bars, much easier and creates uniformity.

These cookie bars are VERY GOOD!!!!!!!!! I did what the other reviewer said and added about 2 1/4 cups of graham crackers and a little more butter. Don't cut these until they are cool or else they will make a mess. Yummy!!!!!

We really enjoyed this recipe a lot - just the right amount of sweetness!  I think I only used about 1 cup of the chips and 1 cup of the coconut and it still covered the pan evenly.  I used chopped raw almonds for the nuts which was a great combination.

I've always loved this recipe.  It's so easy, that it's hard to screw up, unless you over bake it of course.
After awhile you memorize it that's how easy it is.
I just forget once in awhile what the oven degree is & have to look it up, but the recipe always stays in your head.

Even those who don't like coconut would adore these treats.  Techinically, I'd rate this a 4.5 but I have to agree with a review that said these have about a 1/2 c too much chocolate chips.  This, coming from a choco-holic!  These are already a rich dessert so that little bit extra chips just takes it over the edge.  And I'd definitely follow the reviews that suggest putting the nuts BEFORE the coconut and chocolate chips.  Great texture and will avoid that over roasted nut flavor.

I've been making these since the recipe came out and up until this year, I'd been using that same recipe. I've misplaced ALL my holiday recipes so I came here knowing I'd find it. I'm SO glad they change the crust recipe. I like the idea of mixing the crumbs and butter first. I was still melting the butter in the pan THEN adding the crumbs! THIS improvement is worth monkeying with the original recipe. Merry Christmas!

I made these with dark chocolate M&Ms (another reviewer advised against milk chocolate due to sweetness overload, and I fully agree) in Christmas colors for a holiday treat.  Perfect!

After trying a few variations, found that sticking to the recipe exactly worked best.  On to pf the graham cracker then milk layer, I put the nuts down first, then the chocolate (M&Ms in my case) then the layer of coconut on top - makes it easy to press down.

Simple to make and GREAT tasting.  People rave about 'em.

Would have given this 5 stars, but it felt lacking on the graham cracker crumbs.  I added a few extra when I saw how sparse the bottom of the pan was with the recipe amount, and it still wasn't enough.  Modify that, and it should turn out great.

I have loved these since I was a little kid making them.  They're so easy!  When I introduced them to my husband a few years ago, he couldn't believe how awesome they were.  He volunteers to make them even though he's the chef, not the baker in our house.  They're a hit everywhere we go!  He had a brilliant idea of adding fresh chopped bing cherries once.  That was delicious!  We've mixed it up by adding dried cranberries or using different nut or chips.  I can't say enough about this recipe.  Very rich, so take little squares, if you can!

These are one of those ol' standbys, but I've never met anyone who didn't love them.  Even people who don't like coconut seem to love these!  Fast and easy, you can freeze these and they're awesome to eat even while frozen.  In fact, I prefer them that way.

OUTSTANDING! The only thing that I would change about this recipe is to make them, somehow, less delicious, so I wouldn't eat so many! This is the best treat I have made in a long time. I made the recipe exactly as is, except I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet. DELICIOUS!

I needed a dessert for DH to take to a potluck at work and wanted to use up graham cracker crumbs and sweetened condensed milk.  I am not a fan of these cookies but I know others are.  I felt that the graham cracker crust was too thin and not up to holding the topping.  The bars were a hit at the potluck.

These were fantastic!  I made these for a camping trip and my fellow campers just couldn't get enough.  Some of the more adventurous added roasted marshmallows to the top of the bars and uttered OMG as they chewed!

This was soo sweet & rich...but didn't "set"  like a traditional bar.  I do wish it had thicker crust and wasn't as gooey (what a complaint - haha!!) VERY chocolatey. This was good...OK for us, but nothing I would serve up to guests as it was messy to cut and serve (and wasn't very pretty when on a plate)..but WE ATE IT!!

I made these for the first time this weekend and they turned out good. I crushed my own crumbs and added an extra 1/2 cup because there is not enough to spread around the pan. They are rich and sweet and I will be taking these to a potluck this week!

Marginal dessert.  These are not as rich and sweet as they sound from the ingredients.  Next time, I'll just make chocolate chip cookies instead.

These were good although I didn't think they called for enough graham cracker crumbs, it was too moist and didn't cover the bottom of the pan, so I added another 2/3 cup or so. I only got to taste a little, but my coworkers liked them. They were a little hard to remove from the pan, but I followed the instructions on the back of the can, which did not say to spray with non-stick cooking spray :(

HUGE SUCCESS!!! HUBBY IS STILL ASKING FOR THEM!  One note I would add is be sure to cook them all the way.  The cooking time listed in the recipe wasnt enough for my oven so I had to cook them a little longer and then wait for them cool before you try and cut them!

Just had the first bite of this. Yummy.. But extra rich.. So make sure you cut small pieces. I used 2 cups crackers, 1 extra tbsp butter, 1 cup of chocolate chips instead of too, and didn't use the whole can of condensed milk. The taste is great, yet very rich..

Very good, but the butter to graham crumb ratio is off...too much butter, I'll add more crumbs next time.  Other than that, they were a hit!

I'm not sure if the crust was supposed to be crumbly or if I did something wrong.  I pressed firmly into pan and cooked for 19min (it was browned) & cooled for 2hrs.  The taste was great but I was bummed the base fell apart.

Oh my goodness. I tried this at the local coffee shop yesterday, and as soon as I tasted it, I told my husband, "Oh my LORD. I MUST find out how to make these!"   I didn't use any nuts, and I did make it in a pre-made pie crust. The kitchen smelled so wonderful when it was baking. It's SO easy, and with a toddler, easy is my friend!   It's sooooo yummy! I want everyone I know to try it and get the recipe now :D

Super sweet dessert bar that's certainly a crowd pleaser!  I primarily follow the directions with just a few additions.  First, I add a sprinkle of cinnamon and sugar to the graham crumbs before mixing them with the butter.  Then I layer the condensed milk, chocolate chips, coconut, add mini marshmallows, then top with slivered almonds and mini M&Ms.  I bake until the marshmallows start turning golden brown in some spots.  Please note that I also use wax paper in the pan, which occasionally sticks to the marshmallows, but seems to make them easier to get out.  Thanks for this tempting dessert for any sweet tooth!

These are AWESOME!  I don't know if a person would really get 36 bars from this recipe, and I did have to double the butter/graham crackers, but everyone at home and work loved them and they will become a quick dessert staple for us!

I've been eating these since I was a little girl and I always thought my mom created the recipe.  Low and behold she did not.  I love these with almonds because they taste like Almond Joy.  I always use 1 cup of chocolate chips and the recipe still comes out just fine.  One thing I do find is that if you use  the called for 2 cup of chocolate chips put them on top of the graham cracker.  When they melt and then re-cool they form a seal with the bottom and top layers.  The only way I can ever get my bars to cool this way, however, is if I leave them out in the cold for an hour.  They are so good it's hard to not cut into them before they are cool, but you need to.    Also, for another variation mix all ingredients together.  The bars still come out divine.

This was a great recipe to take to a potluck because it's super easy and very yummy. I didn't have coconut on hand and it still turned out well. I used walnuts and semi-sweet chocolate chunks.

I have made these several times.  They are so easy and everyone loves them. I do make the graham cracker crust a little thicker and add a little more butter to compensate for the addition.

Jessiker....when flattening your crumb crust use a flat metal spatula and press very firm.  You can press the entire crust quicker and better.  Press the hooey out of it too and your crust should stay together better.

Easy...Easy..tastes like you spent hours on it. It tastes awesome!!  Cooking spray works just fine and I add 1/2 cup extra graham crackers.  And I mixed white chocolate and semi sweet morsels.

Just as the others said, this is VERY addicting!  I made a few adjustments:  First, I changed the servings to 18.  These are very rich so you don't need to cut them into big pieces.  So, based on 18 servings, here is what I did:  5 tbsp butter (melt it in a pot) 1 cup crushed graham cracker crumbs (once crushed, mix in with butter) Place butter/cracker mixture in bottom of 9x9 pan, spreading with hands til it covers bottom In seperate bowl, combine: 1 C Ghiardelli Semi-sweet Choc Chips 1/2 C Reeses PB Choc Chips 1/2 C Heath Bar Toffee Chips 1/2 C Walnut pieces Mix it all in a bowl.  Spread 1/2 can of Eagle Brand Sweetened Cond. Milk evenly over graham cracker crust.  Pour chip mixture over the condensed milk.  Make sure no condensed milk is showing.  Press down with a fork.   Cook on 350 for 25 minutes.    Absolutely perfect!     Worst part about the whole process is waiting for it to cool down before you can eat it!   ** much easier to cut once it is completely cooled down so I put it in the freezer to speed up the process.   Enjoy!!

These are so easy to make.....I have been making them for years. One other ingredient I put in is maraschino cherries cut it half. I layer all the ingredients like the recipe says but before I pour the milk I put the cherries halfs and then the milk It gives it a nice finish. When I put them on I space them, so that each piece gets one.

This was way too sweet me, and I like sweet stuff.  My 14 year old didn't like them, she said "Maybe there's too many chocolate chips."...Won't be making this one again.

This recipe is a family favorite passed down from my mother-in-law.  I altered it slightly by adding 2 tablespoons of sugar, to the crust mixture.  The best improvement was that I melted a bag of Kraft caramels, and  drizzled it over the top.  Now my family will only eat them that way.  Yummy

This is a delicious recipe.  The recipe I was given used yellow cake mix with the butter instead of the graham cracker crust and just ch.chips, butterscotch chips and pecans.  I don't make it often, b/c I can hardly keep out of it.

These were tasty.  However, I should have followed other reviewers recommendations to double the graham cracker crust layer.. the sweetened condensed milk seeped through the crust and was gooey on the bottom..kind of messy to eat.  I even used a smaller pan than recommended hoping that would make the crust thicker...guess that was a mistake :)  I'll definitely make these again and hopefully they'll turn out better.

Instead of using the graham cracker crumbs, I use Natural Cereal--the kind with the oats, nuts, raisins, etc. Very gooey, but very GOOD!

Mmmm. Yum! I am taking a couple of batches to a cookie swap and I'm so excited because these are DIVINE! This was so easy and quick but it delivered when it came to flavor! I made both batches in less than an hour. You can't beat that! I used real butter,Ghiradelli chocolate chips, unsweetened coconut flakes, and ground hazelnuts.

I love this combination of flavors.  They were super gooey straight out of the oven and you can eat them with a spoon before they harden!  Yum!  But they're also great as bars once they're chilled.  I will keep this one in my recipe file and change it up with different types of nuts (hazelnuts, walnuts, peanuts) or other additives like toffee bits.

I can not stand these bars! They are way too sweet, but my husband likes them. So I always make some for him and to put in the baskets I make up for friends. The crust never holds together real well. I always have cut after cooled, then refrigerate till crust hardens a little, then remove from pan

I make these cookies every year for Christmas.  I double the recipe and use a 11 x 15 jelly roll pan, and cut them into small triangles.  This is a great recipe, make sure you cut them pretty small, as they are very rich!

I have always made these bars since I started baking.  Recently I made them for my in-laws they had never had them.  They were a big hit.  I always use the chocolate chips plus I put candy-coated chocolate candies on the top for whatever the season!!!  I love them!!!!!!!

I used to order these at the coffee shop at school (quite some time ago). I never realized how easy they are to make. I followed the recipe as written, and they were a big hit at a work party. Will make again!

"These are to die for" as stated by one of my colleagues. when I went to the grocery store they were all out of the toll house milk chocolate morsels. I was so disappointed so I ended up buying the triple chip morsels which have milk chocolate,  dark chocolate and white chocolate chips. Well these triple chip morsels made this recipe totally awesome.  One week later I did buy some milk chocolate chips and made them again, they were good but the triple chips are so much better and really kick this recipe up a notch.

Delicious! Only thing I changed in the recipe was a little extra butter and graham cracker crumbs. Makes the bottom crust perfect, in my opinion. Entire pan was gone in 1 night!!! Family loved them

7 Layer Cookies has been a Christmas tradition at my house for decades. Much the same as these cookies, except for the addition of butterscotch chips, and the order of assembling ingredients. Melt butter in an 11 X 9 baking dish. Sprinkle graham cracker crumbs over butter without stirring. Sprinkle coconut over cracker crumbs, then chocolate chips and butterscotch chips (12 oz bag of each), then chopped pecans. Pour sweetened condensed milk over all and bake.

I've made these dozens of times using 1/2 c butter, and 1 c each of crumbs, nuts, coconut,and choc chips with a can of condensed milk.  Didn't need a recipe because the measurements were so easy.  Thought I'd try this recipe to make a slightly larger pan, but it didn't turn out at all.  There is not enough butter to hold 1 1/2 cups crumbs together, and when I went to cut, the crumb crust just fell apart.  Going back to my old no-recipe recipe!

This is a great recipe to make for family parties and or movie nights with friends. One thing that I change is when you put the sweetened condensed milk on the graham cracker mix only use half of the can and after you put the chocolate and coconuts on then evenly spread the rest of the sweetened condensed milk over the top.

I change this recipe by using 1 bag of butterscotch chips  and 1 bag of chocolate chips, and  drizzling the milk on top after the chips and coconut.  It seems to hold everything together and is much better!  Everyone ALWAYS  loves this!

I didn't pour sweetened condensed milk over the graham cracker crumbs and melted butter.  Instead I combined dark chocolate chips, coconut flakes, & a cup of walnuts in a bowl.  I mixed these ingredients  evenly.  Then, I  poured the sweetened condensed milk over these ingredients  and stirred it evenly on them, so they would stick together. The ingredients  stuck together this way and set up really well.  Last, I  poured this mixture evenly in the pan over the  graham cracker crumbs and melted butter.  They turned out great!  My husband and I love them!  I will be making them again in the future.

I did change the recipe. I used 2 cups of crumbs and just a little more butter. I added 3/4 cup of black cherry jam to the condensed milk and I used white chocolate.

I've been making these for years and never a party with any left in the plate.  I too add butterscotch along with the chocolate chips.  I always keep the ingredients on hand because they are a favorite and have become a staple at parties.

My mom made these for us when we were kids - they were always my FAVORITE and still are! My daughter doesn't like coconut, so I substitute marshmallows for the coconut - this year we are going to try using the chocolate chips with the caramel inside as well - I think they will be better (I didn't think the ones we made with marshmallows tasted nearly as good as with the coconut, but I think with the addition of the caramel-filled chocolate chips, they might be better!)

I agree with Stefanie and Julie B. I loved the recipe but felt there was not enogh crust and too much chocolate. With these two slight changes, definitely a 5 star!

I should have tried recipe using graham crackers. Instead I used recipe suggesting vanilla wafers. It called for 9x13 pan which I used. I did not double wafer recipe which my mind told me. Not enough wafers as recipe said, which made a sticky mess! And, even though I took them out five min. early they had stuck to pan and sides of cookie burnt. I was sooo disappointed. I made them before and they were wonderful. Trust your instincts!!! Thanks for wonderful tips on this site!!

I had a specific request for these so I made them and they were delicious. These were so easy to make. Try substituting butterscotch chips for half the chocolate chips for an entirely different taste.

My mother always made these for me to take to school (in the 1970s) when I had to bring a dessert for a party. They went like hotcakes everytime! I don't usually put the nuts in them though. I actually thought it was my mom's recipe until I saw it on the back the Eagle Brand Condensed milk can, ha ha!!!!

Anyway, no fail recipe definitely! and a crowd pleaser!

I've got a small fan base with mine...

Instead of semi-sweet chips (Semi-sweet = Mostly Bitter) I mix it up with milk chocolate and white chocolate chips. Depending on my mood, I'll substitute the graham cracker crust with pie crust for the base. Works out really well.

We have had these bars for Thanksgiving eve since I was a small child.  Beloved by all.  This year I bought the cracker crumbs already crushed and made them totally PERFECT :)  Prep time was less than 10 minutes and even my most picky grandson loved them.

Delicious. Is there a way to get them to hold together better though? And perhaps have the coconut not get quite so crunchy? I think they are fabulous. More than 4 stars as is but not quite 5. Close though. Very close :)

These are amazing! I used chocolate grahams because that's all I had and they were so rich and so good! I gave them 4 stars because I cut them into 15 pieces (about 2inx2in) and doing the math they are 400 calories each!!! Holy COW! There has GOT to be a way to make this lower cal so I can enjoy them without the guilt.

These are tasty yummy goodness! I made a second batch under the direction from my husband that the condensed milk should go on top and soak its way down. I think they were even better that way!

I am by no means a cook or a baker of any sorts. My husband does most of the cooking, so the fact that I was able to make these and that they actually TURNED OUT was amazing! But this was actually extremely simple! They were a hit, and this was my very first attempt. I always had these at church functions when I was younger and other people would make them, so I thought of them and figured I'd give them a try. When I saw the few ingredients that were needed, it was a done deal. They turned out amazing! I read one woman's review about how she added 2 1/2 cups of graham cracker crumbs instead of 1 1/2 and decided upon doing that - what I found was that I felt I needed even a little more, so I added about 3 cups of crumbs and doubled the butter/margarine amount. I definitely don't see how 1 1/2 cups would suffice. I also didn't measure any of the other ingredients either. I just sprinkled walnuts, coconut, butterscotch chips and semi sweet chocolate chips evenly, until it looked to me like a good amount - not too little, not too much and they turned out perfect. Had to leave them in the oven probably an additional 10 minutes because they didn't look done at 25, but everyone's oven is different. I love this recipe and will be using it from now on!

love it! i crushed my own crumbs and added some brown sugar to the crust; i also cut down on the butter and used a little less of chocolate chips, nuts, and coconut than the recipe said. i also added some butterscotch chips and it tasted wonderful! i will definitely make these again!

These were awsome.  I poored the milk over the top of all the ingredients and it worked great.  I tried to cut into this but it was hard as rock to cut.  Eating this was perfect, nice and slightly chewy.

This is the first time that I have made this and I followed the directions just as suggested...I thought it was going to be a horrible mess, but after I cooked them, I let them refrigerate overnight so they would cut evenly...It turned out perfect...and they were a HIT with everyone!

Great!!! The first time I made these, I wasn't sure about the coconut, because it was for the holidays and my sister and I didn't like it. I made one half of them with coconut and the other without. My sister absolutely loves them. The next time I made them it was for a party, so i decided to leave the coconut out completely. My guest didn't even notice the difference!

This recipe originally called for cornflake crumbs, and they are much better made this way.  My mother made these the first time about 40 years ago and we have had them for Christmas ever since.

i thought i did soemthing wrong at first.  i made them to take to a game night only about 2 hours before, but when i went to cut them they all fell apart.  i decided not to bring them, b/c i was so embarrased.  the next day i went to more or less throw it away, but cut a small peice off (since it WAS still tasty) everything stuck together fine.  i think it needed a while to cool and mingle.  and make sure you smoosh everything down together before putting in the oven.  i will make again but the day before and making sure to smoosh it all down.

Pretty good and way better the next day after sitting in the fridge overnight. I took other reviewers' advice and mixed nuts/coconut/choco chips together, spread over crust, then drizzled the milk over top. I thought these were probably a 3-star cookie, but gave them 4 because they took no time whatsoever. I will make again when I need something tasty in a pinch.

These are very popular at my house. The only things I do differently is to mix the chocolate chips, coconut and nuts together then pour over the condensed milk and I pressed with my hands rather than a fork. I have used pecans and almonds so far - we prefer the pecans. The negative thing is how difficult it is to remove from the pan even after it is sprayed. I think I will try lining the pan with sprayed parchment paper. Hopefully it will release from the crust! I am also going to increase the crust by half. Doubling the crust is too much for us. Warning: be sure to allow to completely cool and chips have firmed back up, otherwise you will have a real mess on your hands.

This recipe seems to be everybody's favorite.  I know my family loves it and we usually make it at holiday time but it's great anytime.  It's especially wonderful warmed for about 15 sec. in the microwave and then add a scoop of your favorite Vanilla or Chocolate Ice Cream and drizzle with chocolate sauce.  Yes, it's fattening but it's an occasional treat so we do splurge now and then!  For variety, we sometimes add a layer of butterscotch morsels along with the other layers.  Yummy!

Our family has been making this recipe for years. It is one of our favorites! I like to add the Sweetened Condensed Milk last on TOP of the toppings. I find it helps bind everything together nicely!

The butter is NOT needed.  1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips 1 cup flaked coconut 1 cup chopped walnuts(or pecans)  FIRST, make a graham cracker crust, and then pour 1 can sweetened condensed milk over the crust(once the crust is put in a pan). Then put the "mix" over the crust, and bake @ 350 for @ least 15 minutes.

This has always been a favorite.  I'm so glad I'm sending this away tomorrow so I won't eat it all.  I'm thinking about chopping up leftover Halloween candy to replace to chocolate chips.  That batch will also have to go somewhere away from my reach!

these are much easier and tast better if you do the following: melt 1 stick of butter and pour it in to empty baking dish, then add full sheets of graham crackers w/o making into crumbs first - there is no need to - they come out amazing..just layer the graham crackers on top of melted butter, then follow rest of the recipe ( we use peanuts, not walnuts)

Excellent & very very easy.  They were a hit for two Christmas get togethers this year.  The only thing I would say, like others have, is 1) grease the baking pan really well (I used a really good coating of butter flavored spray) & 2) let these cool down all the way!  Even if they're a bit warm, they have a tendency to fall apart when trying to cut/ get them out of the pan.   Great recipe!

I made these using the Eagle Brand website's recipe, some of the measurements were a bit different.. But My crust hardly stuck together! It's all crumbly and falling apart, any idea why this would have happened? (I'm new at baking!)

I remember making these with my mother when I was a child (30 years ago). I love that I get to share them with my children too. We use a combination of chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, and peanut butter chips. Sometimes we use whit chocolate chips too if there are any in the cabinet. Mixing these together with the coconut and the nuts works really well so the flavors are spread throughout.  I agree with others, pressing the crust in makes them hold together much better.  These cookies are always on my Christmas baking lineup.

I have known these for years as "Hello Dollies". They are quick to throw together and loved by all. I never have to check the recipe because mine calls for 1/2 c butter and 1 cup each of everything else. The order of layers I use are crumb base, coconut, chocolate chips (or your own choice of flavor) nuts, and all topped with the can of Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk. They turn out perfect every time. They are very sweet but -  MMmmmm Good.

This is a favorite bar recipe I use all the time.  It looks pretty when done in a mason jar for holiday gifts.  If you put together a food basket you can add the can of milk and then all the recipient needs is the butter.  Very yummy!

These are *AMAZING* and I'm only dissapointed that I didn't find this recipe till now.  I pre-baked the crust for about 8 minutes and added white and butterscotch chips, and used pecans for the nuts.  Next time, I will use much less butter for the crust.

I love this recipe.  I used this in a basket of christmas goodies that I made for family and friends last year and everyone loved them.  I love that they are so easy!!  I keep all the ingredients measured out in a tupperwear for when I have unexpected guests.  I used 1/2 of the coconut called for and used skor bits instead.  Salted peanuts are the best - a little salty and sweet!

So good....I love these bar type recipes...they totally curb a craving with so many diferent flavors and textures...I used some toasted coconut on top if the crust for starters...and of course used white, butterscotch, and semi-sweet chips...with more coconut on top. These are so easy and tasty! Thanks!

These are wonderful! I've been using this recipe for years and I actually prefer it without the nuts better. I like to cut them up small and place in decorative cupcake cups for themed parties: X-Mas, 4th of July, etc.  You can buy those decorative cupcake cups everywhere and they look so festive and taste even better!  Another plus is that they're not a mess to transport, but you do have to like coconut to appreciate these bars.

Very good, my husband that hates coconut even thought this was a good cookie bar. I added more chocolate chips and used chopped almonds.

I accidentally added the evaporated milk LAST once when my kids were small and I've been making it that way ever since.  It keeps the nuts from tasting roasted and seeps through everything.  I send them now to my son who is in Iraq.  He still loves them.

Taste great.  Needed refrigerator cooling prior to cutting.  If cut at room temp., they made a huge mess.    Very sweet!

It is a tradition for me to make these every year during the holidays. The butterscotch chips really make it taste the best. I use half chocolate and half butterscotch. I use pecans for the nuts. So easy and so, so yummy!!

Very easy recipe, but have had better.  Next time I will mix butter and graham cracker crumbs together first and then press into pan.  Also, found it to be a little too much chocolate for my taste, as the chocolate overpowered the nuts and coconut.  Will try recipe again with less chocolate.

These go over well at school parties, but I use Oreo crumbs, since they are "nut free" (and graham crumbs are not). I prefer the grapham taste, but rules are rules!  I always mix the butter and crumbs together for a better crust.

These are great! I made them for a 4th of July party and everyone raved about them. I didn't use all the chocolate chips called for and they were still plenty chocolaty. I will be using this recipe again and again. Maybe try some different combinations. I think peanut butter chips and chopped peanuts sounds yummy too.

Wow ... These bars are MEGA sweet and I agree that the recipe calls for WAY TOO MANY chocolate chips. These are just a bit too rich. I will try the other recipe next time, Magic Cookie Bars II.

It sticks together much better if you pour the sweetened condensed milk over all.  My version is walnuts and milk chocolate chips.  I’ve never had to throw away any or “bring home” any.

I have made these several times and they are so good. One tip I might add is to put the coconut on first and then the chocolate chips and nuts. It keeps the coconut from falling off when you eat it.

Ok I must be glutton for punishment, BUT instead of Graham crackers , I use Oreos (not the cream middle just cookie outside), and when I tell you it took the bars to another level I'm not kidding! These things are already rich but the chocolatey crust is just divine! I used a whole container of Oreos with the same amount of butter and it seems to work well enough. I dare you to try it!

I made as directed, but used gluten free graham crackers.  Recipe turned out well, but I made another batch at the same time using the (Gluten Free) Magic Cookie Bars recipe.  This other one used a homemade peanut butter crust that really improved this basic idea.

First of all - being a foodie this dessert is awesome but this recipe is flawed. First you mix the melted butter and g cracker crumbs and press those down w a fork. Do NOT pour on the sw cond milk - it goes last and is the glue that holds it all together. Sprinkle choc chips, pecans, then coconut then pour ribbons of sw cond milk over it and bake. Looks like this recipe was hurriedly submitted by someone who had never baked this and only halfway read the recipe.

A co-worker gave me the recipe for these cookie bars many years ago. The recipe was mostly the same but the sweetened condensed milk was poured over the top (after the coconut). I simply cannot bring myself to make it with the milk poured over the graham cracker/butter crust. Same ingredients, but I think doing it the old way is best. Maybe one day I'll try it.

Add combination of 1C butterscotch with 1C semisweet morsels; reduce nuts to 1/2C.
After adding the morsels, nuts and coconut, layer 2C mini marshmallows and pour 1 can sweetened condensed milk over the top of marshmallows, then bake.

Make the bars like the recipe suggest but tweek it slightly by adding more coconuts (2/3cups) just because of adding white chocolate morsels, I mix my morsels, nuts, and coconuts in a Bowl so all the ingredients are evenly distributed. Also I pour 1/2 the condensed milk on the crust, then the remainder over the topping mixture. Yum yum  for the tum tum my boyfriend gets these only in December for the Christmas Holidays, he waits all year for these goodie.

These are great, but I tried making them with a substitution suggested by my sister, Sheryl, and they were absolute perfection! My husband called them "Burnt Squares" because of their appearance, but nobody could dispute the amazing taste! Just replace the Graham crumbs with an equal amount of Oreo crumbs mixed with 1/4 cup of white sugar. Delicious!

I made these and doubled the recipe. I added 1.5 cups of quick cook oats and a cup of flour to the butter/graham cracker mixture. I also added 1.5 tsp of kosher salt. I increased the butter to 1 cup total (for doubled recipe. I baked these off for 8 minutes and allowed to cool before adding the milk. I used heath bar crunch bits in addition to the chocolate chips. Smothered with the nuts, coconut then added more chocolate chips and had a small handful of salted caramel chips I sprinkled on top. Baked an additional 10 minutes to make sure all was melted and browned. Came out quite amazing!!

Used to make these when I was little and loved them. Since being diagnosed with celiac, I  made the the graham cracker crust with Schar gluten free honey Graham’s. Not as crisp, but just as delicious. I would NOT add 2 cups of chocolate chips. I am all about chocolate, but this was overwhelming. Try halving it with one cup. This is a great dessert to make with little kids - so easy and fun! My 2 yr old and 5 year old loved putting all the layers on

This was super easy to make! I loved how fast it all came together. I somewhat regret the caramel as it’s really chewy now, but other than that I’m really happy with it! Would definitely make it again.

I trick I learned was to always put the condensed milk on last. Pour it over the coconut. It makes it a bit more gooey and it holds everything together, otherwise your coconut falls off.

WATCH WHILE YOU’RE BAKING!!!! I followed this recipe to the T and checked them 3 mins before my timer goes off and my cookies are burnt! :( I guess our oven is too hot so def watch it while you’re baking. I gave 5 star because it’s simple to make. I will def make it again and just watch them closely while they bake. It smells delicious even though their burnt.

This is a tasty, easy to throw together bar cookie that my family found delicious. I did double the graham cracker and butter layer on the bottom because I used chocolate graham crackers which were really good; for contrast I used white chocolate baking chips and I topped with slivered almonds. I will use this recipe again and probably mix up the ingredients. I want to try out "nilla" wafer cookies, m'n'Ms, dried fruit and other items that sound good. (This cookie is a little messy to eat, I need to work on finding ways to keep it from falling apart.)

I have been making these cookie bars for years using an old recipe. After preheating oven I put the stick of butter in the pan and place the pan in the oven until the butter melts. Take the pan out and sprinkle the graham cracker crumbs evenly over the melted butter. Then pour the sweetened condensed evenly over the crumbs. Add the rest of the ingredients in order as listed. Press down with a fork then bake.

Followed exact recipe. Cool down time should be over night if possible. Even hours after, it was still not set and fell apart. By the next morning they were set perfectly. Absolutely a favorite in my house!

The easiest and original way of doing the crust is to melt the butter in the pan first in the oven then sprinkle the graham cracker over that. Been doing it like this for 30 years. Works like a charm.

This is the most addictive dessert!! I dont like chocolate or coconut so I use toffee bits or caramel chips instead.  I took it to work for my colleagues and they started calling it “dessert crack”.  When I want something quick and sweet, this is my go-to!!

Tips for tricky crumby crust: line pan with foil and lightly coat with cooking spray. When cooled after cooking, remove foil and cut into bars. Bars should be more uniform. My Great Aunt used this method; no one could figure out how her bars always came out like "bars". Lol 
I like to had less chocolate chips because 2 cups is too much for my family, and I like to add more coconut and walnut. These disappear like "magic" every time!

Left out the nuts because my son is allergic to nuts and used 1 cup choc chips and i cup butterscotch chips.  I also poured the condensed milk as a last step.   It was AWESOME!  I would highly recommend this!!!  So yummy!

I love these bars. One change I pour the condensed milk over the layers as the last step instead of the first step (over the crumbs.) The bars’ layers stuck together better and had more carmelized and “shine” to them.  I learned this step from my MOm when I made them as child. 
My Mom, 89 yrs, made these for us all the time growing up. She got the recipe from her Mom. She lost her recipe; I was happy to find it here.

I have made this many times, but oftentimes misplace my recipe, so here I am at All Recipes.  This is so easy to make and only uses one pan.  For Christmas, I used red and green M&Ms for a festive look.

I add White Chocolate Chips and substitute chopped peanuts. Here is the really important part.. make your graham cracker crust and bake by itself for ten minutes.  Add condensed millk and chocolate chips and bake for additional ten minutes. Finally add nuts and Coconut and bake for final ten minutes. Otherwise your coconut is burnt before your crust has a chance to bake! This recipe is a huge hit at my store!

I love these. I recommend using Biscoff cookie crumbs instead of Graham cracker (250 g package works well with the amount of butter in recipe). I use semisweet chips, white chips, toffee bits, and coconut on top.

These are a classic and always delicious. When I make them during holidays I use walnuts or pecans and in the summer I use macadamia nuts. The recipe is always perfect as written.

I decided to try my hand at these because they are definitely a favorite amongst family and friends at all events. My sister started making these years ago, and I thought they were difficult...Ha, so very easy and I combined both semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips; so delicious! Next I’m going to try peanut butter and milk chocolate chips for variety..

It was a hit at the potluck! Several said it brought back memories of their childhood. Followed directions, except omitted nuts. Use half chocolate chips and half butterscotch chips. Lined the pan with parchment paper: easy to lift cookies out, no cooking spray needed.  Followed a suggestion of another reviewer, and cut the bars while still warm. Will make again! Thank you!

My mother use to make these squares when I was a little girl back in the early 70's. Back at that time they were called Dream Bars. And now I make them for my own teenage kids. Super easy to make, made even easier by using parchment paper underneath, as the milk can easily stick to the sides, which makes it more difficult to cut when cooled. Use parchment paper and it'll be a breeze to cut. No greasing pan prior.  No spatula needed to even anything out. It's basically a throw everything into the pan type of dessert. Today I am making them, but for the first time I'm adding some chopped pecans.  I do the reverse of this recipe though. Graham crumbs at the bottom, add chocolate chips (less than the required amount if you like) than the coconut flakes...with the condensed milk ADDED LAST ON THE TOP. 
If you need a quick, easy dessert, this is it. It hasn't been around all these decades for nothing. Don't forget the glass of cold milk you'll want it with this.

I make this every Christmas and it comes out great.  Two tips I use two cups of graham crackers and a full stick of butter I don’t think the amount in the recipe is enough.  Second I pour the condensed milk on last after all the layers are done.  Make sure you let them cook a few hours before you cut them.

These are on my must make list for Christmas goodies. This is the classic recipe and turned out perfectly. I did have to use almost two whole packages of graham crackers, (crushed with meat tenderizer,)I prefer those over the store bought graham cracker crumbs to have enough to cover the pan bottom. They are delicious and addictively good.

I have made these  hundreds of times. They are my favorite holiday go to cookie bar. I always sub 1/2 the chocolate chips with butterscotch chips. Makes a huge difference in taste.  I cut them in bars before they cool.  Otherwise, they harden and are really hard to cut and remove from the pan.  Some people line the pan with foil for  easier removal. Probably good idea. All that sweetened milk carmelizes and gets a little hardened.  If you chop your nuts smaller the bars are easier to cut and the nuts stick to the bar better.  Do not over bake.

This has been a family fave since I was a kid.  We switch a cup of chocolate morsels for butterscotch, and like half a cup extra of nuts.  Serving hint: cut into small pieces-they're richer than they look!!

I had to increase the amount of graham cracker/butter mixture to be able to completely cover the bottom of the 9 x 13 pan. 
Used a pizza cutter to cut most of the pieces after it cooled, then used a knife to finish the cutting. Froze part of the finished product for more lasting enjoyment. That worked well.

I used the recipe's recommended amount of graham crackers. I melted the butter in the microwave and poured it over the crushed crackers in the dish and just mixed and pressed it in there. After putting the remaining ingredients on top, I drizzled the sweetened condensed milk over everything. Turned out great!

These bars were a hit at the high school bake sale. I will definitely make again (using 1 to 1 1/4 c. chocolate chips or maybe even mini chips). I followed the hint of putting the nuts first followed by chocolate chips and coconut. Getting the coconut nice and toasted on top was a great finishing touch. Enjoy!

Substituted oatmeal for all but 1/3 c graham cracker.  I prefer how this recipe layers ingredients with sweetened condensed milk in first and the chips & coconut on top.  It makes a much neater product going into the oven.  Also lined the pan with foil and greased the foil in the pan.  Still in the oven now so I haven't tasted yet, but it sure smells good!

I've made many versions of this, and this is still the best recipe. Here are a few optional adjustments I made:
Per another review, I melted the butter first, but I did .75c (1.5 sticks). I let it brown slightly, lightly salted it (butter was unsalted), added a few dashes of pumpkin pie spice, extra cinnamon, and a little chocolate extract. I let the butter brown oh so slightly, and added a few tablespoons of mini chocolate chips (I think too many would make it burn/give it the wrong texture) before I added the packaged crumbs. I didn't measure, but it was at least two cups of crumbs because I, too, like it thicker. Add, stir, add, stir until it's perfect. This made an insanely rich, buttery-sweet, spiced flavor to the crust layer. Took us by surprise.

I used the full 14oz can, with a small bit reserved, spread thinly on the crust. Per another reviewer's notes, I made sure walnuts were definitely next so they didn't burn. I used a mix of milk chocolate and semisweet chocolate chips - large ones. I drizzled the small amount of condensed milk over the chips for extra gooeyness, then added the coconut. 

The smell was divine, and the time it takes for it to cool is torture. I even put it outside, it's supposed to be winter but we're having a warm spell so it didn't help. It's worth waiting though b/c it does get messy without it.

This is a pretty foolproof recipe, not much to lose!

Oh, final tip: think of the ratio of walnuts to chocolate chips as the ratio that controls swee

this was VERY easy to make. 
I just melted the butter in the microwave and added the graham cracker crumbs.
I like that you can add whatever you want on top.  the only thing is that this is VERY sweet and that is coming from someone with a sweet tooth. 
I added butterscotch chips and I think that added to the too sweetness.  I might try without the butterscotch chips next time.

I changed around a few things on this recipe as i use Ritz crackers instead of graham crackers, and I pour the milk last, over everything, makes it really nice and brown, does not burn the coconut flakes. I added about 1/2 cup more of chocolate chips, It really tasted great.

I made these GLUTEN FREE by using Arrowroot Animal Cookies and processing them in my food processor for less than a minute and turning them into crumbs.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. (I used their version that uses half chocolate chips and half butterscotch.) You would never know they are gluten free or other than original. They are DELICIOUS (and addicting.) !!

I mixed the toppings instead of layering them, everything else to spec. They were really good. Only thing missing maybe a hint of saltiness. I'm not a salt fan but still thought they could use a little. Maybe sprinkle sea salt in the milk? Also did anyone try pouring the milk over the mix instead of the mix over the milk? And how did it turn out? Thanks.

This recipe was a total failure for me. Even checking on the squares early, they were overcooked, so only the centre was edible. I also found that they were too thin for my liking. I will stick with Hello Dolly squares instead.

Been making this recipe since the 60's, which I got from my grandmother. Always referred to them as 7 layer bars, that way you could remember the ingredients.
Always did 1/2 chocolate, 1/2 butterscotch chips, with pecans.
Also, added the condensed milk last, it helps hold the ingredients together better.
If you know people that have allergies, you can delete that item, and they still taste great.

I place the butter in the baking dish in  the preheating oven until melted and a hint of browning . This process  creates a bit more richness. Then I pull it out of the oven and mix the graham crackers into the butter making a base.  I also drizzle the milk on each level. 1st on the crumb level, then on the 2nd layer of 1c Semi-sweet chocolate chips with the 1c Butterscotch chips. I then put on the top generously amount of coconut flake and once again use the rest of the milk on top. Having the milk on all layers, this allows the bars to stay together.  I have had issues if I didn't use the sweetened milk throughout the layers.

I have a recipe that my grandmother used to make. However, when she baked half of the recipe was in her head and half was written down! I found THIS recipe and used it for the steps only. I used her measurements ( more butter and graham crumbs for crust and I used half semisweet half milk chocolate chips) I am proud to say my kitchen smells like my grandma's used to when I was a child! Isn't that what baking is all about? They turned out great!

Always a favourite!  They always turn out if you melt your butter and crumbs together before putting in your pan. I also use a 9X9 pan or even an 8X8 pan to make them thicker.

I need something to do with my left over crumbly muffin pieces.They were great and tasty but some fell apart. I had a can of eagle brand and thought I might be able to  find something that I could use these crumbs as a base. I decided to use this recipe and add the 2 cups of crumbles to the buttery graham cracker base. I added an additional 1/2 stick of melted butter but followed the recipe exactly after that. I am delighted it worked very well.

Many complained about the crust being crumbly...
!!!Missing ingredient !!!  1/4 Cup light brown sugar in the crust!!!
It is on the sweeten condensed milk can... 
  I learned this after my cookie were in the oven.. OUCH!!

Really great recipe.  Brought extra to work and they loved it.  Only change would be making a little more "crust", was a little sparse for the pan.

I followed the recipe; adding a few more chips, 1+ cup milk chocolate and 1+ butterscotch chips.  Makes for a nice little treat during this blizzard we're enduring right now.

I love these bars and make them a lot at Chrisrmas! Other people love them too. Here are my suggestions for making them even better:
- use an extra 2 Tablespoons of butter in the crust with the graham crackers
- 1 1/2 sleeves of graham crackers is the perfect amount
- put the walnuts in a food processor to make very fine (but if you freeze them, ensure they are thawed first)
- pour the sweetened condensed milk on last and coat everything (because they are more moist this way)
I have made these so many times; this is what I have done for the past several years with fantastic results! Enjoy,

My mother used to make these and everyone LOVED  them.  Her recipe was a little skewed, so I had to  find it online.  I do use parchment paper underneath it to keep it from sticking, the sweetened condensed milk will do that.... Use a pizza cutter to cut into whatever size you like...

This recipe is great as is! I was in a rush so I made a couple of mistakes by using a very finely shredded coconut (I miss bought) and I accidentally used too much graham crackers  (didn't double check the recipe) and they were the best of all the girl scout's Christmas cookie exchange! one of the dads couldn't stop eating them! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Just a couple suggestions to try. Line your baking dish with nonstick foil. The whole thing lifts out. Cool over night before cutting. Also, I tried someones suggestion to substitute graham crackers with a box of chocolate cake mixed with 1 1/2 sticks of melted butter. GREAT! Pour sweeten condensed milk OVER everything. Holds together better. Lastly, try garnishing with maraschino cherries diced very small. They look wonderfully festive and give just a hint of that nice cherry/chocolate combo.

It was  a bad idea to line the pan with tinfoil as difficult to get out. Maybe put a little condensed milk over crust then rest in two batches over toppings . I kept a few chocolate chips and coconut to sprinkle over the top before baking. Refrigerate before cutting into bars.

I decided to line the pan with parchment, and layer it with the sweetened condensed milk on top, like many had suggested.  They were in the over for about 25 minutes and I thought "these smell different than I remember" and as I was cleaning the counter I saw the tin of milk.  I figured, "what the hay" and pulled them out and poured the condensed milk evenly on top.  I was thankful I had put the parchment in.  I kept checking it until I though it was brown enough on top.  I cut them while they were still warm, and thought they looked ok.  They were really great, thus my 5 stars.  If the recipe could survive my oversight, it's a good one!

This is one of my families holiday favorites. I use real butter and it is so rich and delicious. They ask for it specifically every year. I only use enough chips, nuts and coconut to make sure there is a little in every bite. If any one is too thick it is overpowering. I also press the toppings slightly into the goo and it bubbles around it all.

The texture and cookies came out well and moist. However next time I will modify the gram cracker butter mixture by adding 1/2 cup of sugar, to give it a sweet salty taste.

I baked these for a charity bake sale for my husband's work. These sold out quickly. So simple to make and very rich and delicious. My one complaint is that the crust was very thin. Next time I will increase the amount of graham crackers / butter. But great recipe in a pinch.

These were delicious!  I subbed half of the chocolate chips for mini m&ms.  I agree with the previous poster who said to cut these into small portions.  They make your teeth hurt!  Very yummy and a hit with my kids.

Wonderful recipe. Very simple & easy to make. I have made this dozens of times for parties & everyone always seems to love it. I don't add the chopped nuts because I don't like them. Try this recipe its great!

With little notice that my husband was coming home from a week-long trip, I wanted to make something sweet for a surprise dessert.  These bars were super simple and delicious.  Though a bit rich, he had several pieces after dinner and then some for breakfast the next morning!  I followed the basic recipe with great results.

These are deadly.  Fast, VERY easy and perfect.  I recommend making this recipe exactly as written, you can't go wrong.  Just be prepared to make them again and again, they won't last long.

How can these NOT be good??  Loaded with "bad for you" stuff, but they taste marvelous.  My daughter made them by herself for her teacher's birthday - a big hit!  Luckily, the brown on her nose was only from the chocolate chips ;-)

Made this as instructed with the addition of a handful of butterscotch chips. I'm not sure if that is what put this over the edge for me, but it was too rich for my taste.

I use a mixture of butterscotch chips along with the chocolate chips. Have been making these for many years.Very rich and always a hit. A friend recently tried one claiming he didn't like coconut. Now he wants a whole pan of these for himself.

This recipe was so yummy!  I cooked mine for 25 minutes and that was about 5 minutes too long, the edges were a little hard.  So I just kept those for myself.

My mom made these for us when we were growing up, and she would sometimes use butterscotch chips too.  We now call these "wedding cookies" because when I brought them to work the first time, my boss sent me an email and asked me to marry him.  Seven years later, we are still happily eating magic cookie bars.  There must be something truly "magic" about them.

The easiest cookie bars to make and so delicious!  I've make these almost every few months and they disappear within hours at the office. I usually add only a little bit of coconut because some people don't like it, but I love them with or without!

You cant go wrong with these bars. I have been making them for years. Sometimes I will change it up a bit and use peanut butter, butterscotch, white or whatever morsels I happen to have in the drawer.

These were a bit sweet for my taste (which is saying a lot).  My husband does not like nuts or coconut, so he of course was not a fan.  I did get some compliments from guests.

I love coconut and these really hit the spot!  Be aware- they are VERY rich and sweet!  They actually hurt my teeth.  Everyone thought that they were divine though, and I will be making them again this year for a company holiday party...

My mom has made this for years, and now I make it for my little ones (minus coconut).  It is an awesome "kid" cookie, but my husband likes to take it to work.  They are a little gooey, and caramelly-sweet.  I love these!

Awesome!  I haven't had these in years!  My family couldn't stay away from them!  So easy, quick, and soooo good!  I made them in a disposable foil pan, and took them away for the weekend.  No mess or clean up!  So happy to have this recipe!

These are always a hit at holiday parties! A favorite of mine since I was a kid.  At parties, I tend to get "what are these?" and "mmmmmm..." immediately following.  I like to use peanut butter and chocolate chips.

This cookie recipe is now my new favorite!!  So EASY to make!  They are sooo yummy.  I made the suggested variation of adding butterscotch chips.  Simply the best.  I am going to bring it to the next cookie exchange!!

A sorority sister made these for our annual cookie swap.  They were wonderful.  I had to beg for the recipe.  They are easy to make and only use one pan, so not alot of clean-up.  They are now one of my faves.

This recipe calls for WAY too many chocolate chips. Otherwise it is a excellent recipe. Use only 1 cup (6 oz) chocolate chips and you will have a winner. Also make sure to press down the graham cracker crust layer before adding the sweetened condensed milk. These bars are great - I have make them twice so far for the holdiays!
