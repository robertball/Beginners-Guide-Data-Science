I made these right before going to a family outing and was so embarrassed b/c they tasted horrible.  Way Way to much mustard and very salty.  I wish I would have read the other reviews before making them.

Made it for many parties and everyone has loved it! Never any leftovers. The only thing I did differently was substitute the garlic salt for garlic powder. Was afraid it would be too salty  So I added a little salt on top.

I have to agree with Molson7.  Sorry, way too salty and the mustard was overpowering.  Might be good with just a sprinkle of salt and 1.5 teas of mustard but as is, thumbs down.

Your definitely on the right track with this one Rhonda.  I like to add pickle relish to mine (a little dill and sweet).  Sometimes I use minced onions in place of the onion powder.  Both ways are delicious.  Don't forget that little sprinkling of paprika on top for a pretty presentation.

This was good after a few changes...I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and then used just a pinch of kosher salt.  A little less mustard, a little more mayo.  Also added a pinch of sugar.  Really good with the changes, not so good without them.

Good ingredients when serving many, very basic appealing taste with adjustments made. 1 TBSP mustard for a dozen eggs, 1 tsp onion powder, 4-5 TBSP mayo. Then S & P t to taste.  Kept paprika for that touch of classic color.  Increased mayo needed for right consistency for decorating gun.

I  love deviled eggs but I hate mustard, so if you don't like the overpowering taste of the mustard use dry mustard instead. =]

I tend to like my food salty, so I kind of ignored some of the other reviews on these. Big mistake. Normally I do put some mustard & pickle relish in mine. So I was expecting them to be close to the way I make mine. I'm not quite sure what the problem was, but they did not turn out as expected. Will not be making these again.

This is a great starting point for making deviled eggs.  Since different people have different tastes for example if you have a hundred people in a room you may have half who like it and half who don't it can be adjusted to personal preferences . For our family's taste we cut the mustard in half then used a small slice of onion and 2 cloves of garlic chopped up very fine then added salt and pepper a little at a time to suite our taste. Seldome if ever do I use a recipe without tinkering with it.

I didn't have paprika on hand so I stuck to the olive slice. Oh and I used a sweet and spicy beer mustard. Can't beat the "thrift" or ease in a plate of deviled eggs!

I did read all the salty reviews so I cut back on the garlic salt a bit but it was still salty, must have been the mustard. It was ok. I usually put relish in mines. This is more akin to a an egg salad sandwich. Simple.

I'm Korean, and I came here 2 weeks ago. I made this recipe yesterday. It was delicious, but it was not as spicy and salty as Korean food. If you want to make it healthier I recommend that you use mashed sweetpotatos and potatos instead of eggs yolks. I think that it would also be good to use any other sauces for example, salsa, chili and tabasco.

This is a great recipe.  It calls for 1 tablespoon of mustard.  I suggest 1/2 tablespoon.  It was a little too much to handle. But if you like mustard then it is a wonderful treat.

I’m from S. Korea. This was my first time to make April’s Deviled Eggs. It was really tasty but somewhat different from Korean food. I used garlic powder instead of salt. There was not enough salt. If I made this again, I would try adding hot sauce and eat it with pickles. It would be wonderful. I could not taste the mayo or mustard, so I recommend adding more of them. That would be perfect.

I am sorry to have to say anything bad about someone's recipe but  exactly as written, I did not care for it, way too much mustard, way too salty and i found the onion powder taste very strong. I may try this again with some reviewers tweaks like, using less mustard and garlic powder instead of salt, but there are so many other deviled egg recipes i think i will kepp looking for the "one".

This recipe is great! My family loved them. I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, because it really doesn't need salt in it. I know other people have complained it was too salty, I think the final flavor of the eggs will depend on what type of mayonnaise and mustard you use. For example I have noticed there are big variations between different brands of mayonnaise. Some have a more tangy flavor than others, some are creamier than others, etc. Next time I made these I used ranch dressing instead of mayonnaise, less mustard, and added a bit of dill. They were delicious! :o)

I took these to a MOPS meeting and got rave reviews. I did change the recipe though. I used 18 eggs, 6 tbsp. of mayo and 3 tbsp. mustard. By accident I ended up putting in 2 tsp. of garlic powder then added finly minced onion and 2 tbsp of sweet pickle juice. Everyone said they were great and there wasn't a single egg left. Thanks for the reviews. the mayo should be twice the mustard and from there you can really make these your own.

I didn't have mayo, so substituted Dijonaisse.  It turned out to be a great alternative to my original recipe.  I'd do it again.

I personally liked the flavor of this recipe alot.  But it turned out too dry, so I had to add two more tablespoons of Mayo to make it creamy enough.  Other than that small detail, it's a good recipe!

I didn't dig the garlic in this. I LOVE garlic, but I think it was just too much for these dainly little eggs. When making this again, I added a little apple cider vinegar and celery salt to give it a kick.

Nothing "delicate" about the seasonings. Very salty, very mustard-y. Maybe if you cut the garlic salt and the mustard in half, it would be better. As the recipe stands, though, all we could taste was mustard.

I want to make deviled eggs for a family lunch, and after reading the reviews already made for this recipe I decided to give it a try with just two eggs so I could sample it first.  I thought they were too salty, but my husband thought they were fine.  It seems to be very much personal taste.  I will make them for the lunch, but I'll do as a lot of others have done, and halve the mustard/double the mayonnaise.

Needed more mayo. Will use regular mustard next time- amount of dry mustard used made mixture very bitter. Bland recipe. Added small amount of relish to liven it up.

Was a good basic recipe.  I didn't add the onion powder and used a fourth of the recommended amount of garlic salt.  Other than that the eggs were tasty.

I really thought these eggs were very good.  I added only 2 tablespoons of relish and 1/2 tablespoon of horseradish.  When I make it again I will puree the relish and onions. I'm not used to eating these with a little crunch.

Served this as part of a Christening buffet.  We topped ours off with  dollop of Caviar or a salt packed Anchovy.  Great with a dry Champagne.
Everyone loved them and my cook made over 500 of them and they flew off the servers platters.

You have to have perfect boiled eggs for this kind of dish.  Which means bringing the eggs to a boil, turn off heat, leave them in the water for 18 minutes.  They're perfect every time.  This had way too much mustard too.

Of all the ways I have prepared Deviled Eggs over the years, I always come back to this basic recipe, because for some reason it is the one people like the best. These basic igredients are winners when you adjust them a bit. You really should use more mayo than mustard, and the addition of dill pickle relish is always good. I don't think I ever measure the ingredients when I make these, I just adjust the taste to my family's liking.

Took to a recent fish fry, was a great hit.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I think the onion and garlic powder plus whipping the yolk mixture was what made these eggs extra special.

Everyone love's deviled eggs and they are so easy to make, very affordable appetizer.  I'm always looking for ways to change them up a little.  I tried this one, even used half of the amount of garlic salt...just leave out the garlic salt completely.  For me, it just does not belong in deviled eggs.  I tried the recipe again replacing the garlic salt with garlic powder and enjoyed them so much more.

These were OK... The mustard was a little stronger than I like. If I make these again, I'd add a little chopped up onion instead of the onion powder. I also would add a little pickle relish...

This recipe is the best not only because it tastes so great, but it has simple ingredients. That is what I look for in a recipe.

Wasn't crazy about this recipe so I made some changes - more mayo, no garlic salt, added sweet relish.  With these changes the eggs were the best, everyone loves them.

After reading the reviews I used 1 teaspoon of mustard, 3 tablespoons of mayonnaise, 1/4 teaspoon of garlic salt, and added a tablespoon of sweet relish.  ** Because I tweaked a lot.

I thought these were okay, but there was too much mustard and they were too salty.  One of my guests suggested less mustard and a little sugar next time.  They definitely packed a punch!

They were quick and all but it was really salty.. maybe you should use garlic powder instead of garlic salt.. I don't know.. it just didn't have that oomph...

Based on other reviews, I used granulated garlic instead of garlic salt.  My kids loved it and would never have eaten deviled eggs before, until they tried the yolk mixture of this recipe.  I used a bit more mayo to make it creamier, about a half tablespoon.  I love mustard and it was a delicious mustardy taste.

They tasted SO good! I almost ate all of them myself. I changed a bit though. I found the mustard was very overpowering so i added another teaspoon of mayonnaise. It tasted great after that! I also decided to leave out the garlic salt and the onion powder. Im very glad that i did after i looked at the other reviews though. I just simply didnt have those two ingredients and thought it best just to leave them out. VERY GOOD

This recipe was way to salty. I ended up having to add 1tsp more of mayo, 1/4 tsp sugar and 2 tsp white vinegar to cut the salt down. I'll be using garlic powder next time along with vinegar when I make these again.
