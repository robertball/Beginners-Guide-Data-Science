It was dry. Instead of adding water into the mixture I added an additional egg, and I reduced the heat down to 350Â°. I cooked them for 30 minutes. 
They seemed nutty. Not bad, but I don't know if I'll make them again.

Batter was a little dry so I added 1 tablespoon of water, then chopped nuts and some chocolate chips.  Baked for 43 min. then topped with melted choco chips.  It was okay but I don't think I will make it again as husband didn't like the taste.
