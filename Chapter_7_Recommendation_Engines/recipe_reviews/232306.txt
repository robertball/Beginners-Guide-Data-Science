Just mixed this up for dinner and it's delicious! I did have to change a few things, but nothing major...I used a bagged slaw mix and I omitted the celery b/c I was out of it. Also, I didn't have chives on hand, so I used green onions (about 4 b/c I love an onion-y flavor in my slaw. As for the honey-Dijon mustard, well, I didn't have any of that either, lol, but I did have regular Dijon mustard AND honey on hand, so I made some up and proceeded w/ the recipe. Don't skip toasting the almonds, as they really give this a wonderful nutty flavor. Great mix of flavors and textures. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made it for a family bbq - it was super good! I used bagged slaw and didn't add celery, but I don't think that would change the outcome of the recipe at all. The dressing is delicious

Terrific flavors! Used a bag of slaw mix and since I did not have honey Dijon mustard, just Dijon mustard I added extra honey. Also omitted the poppy seeds. Will definitely make this again. Thank you for sharing.

Delicious! Unlike some other recipes, you can eat it right away and don't have to wait while the dressing and salad "get to know each other". I chopped up the dried cranberries and used a combination of red and yellow peppers (since I didn't have green on hand) and thoroughly enjoyed the flavors.

This was good!!  I don't think I have ever had a coleslaw that used honey mustard, but it was nice and different :)  I didn't have the dried cranberries, but I did have dried apricots that I chopped up and used.  Also used green onion instead of chives.  Great and I love having this in the fridge to snack on as well!
