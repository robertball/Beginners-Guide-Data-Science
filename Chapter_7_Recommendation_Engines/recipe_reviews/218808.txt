Quick and easy dinner!  I'm not crazy about mint, so I left it out, and it was great.

This was a very good recipe, though I felt like it needed a little more "tang" to have a Greek flair. I did add a little olive oil (about 1T) for extra flavor and because it was a little "sticky." Next time I will also add more tomatoes and maybe a splash of lemon juice (?) to perk it up. All in all though - very good. I used olives - no mint.

My husband and I really like this.   The spinach noodles are a little strange tasting to me, though I think thats due to my pregnancy ;) We used a pound of campari tomatoes, no mint since the cook noted use either black olives or mint.  And I also added garlic and oregano and olive oil. yummmyyyy

I really like the simplicity of this recipe, and look forward to making a version of it again this Spring & Summer when my tomato plants are producing and I have more mint in the garden.  I used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes this time, and it turned out okay.  I think it needs more flavor though--maybe some oregano.  I added chicken to my husband's plate to make it heartier for him, but my daughter & I liked it without.

As written, this is rather bland. Add some good quality olive oil and some balsamic vinegar and it becomes 4 star worthy. Great lunch option in the summer when tomatoes and mint are at their peak.
