I loved it!  Use more garlic and oregano than recommended.

Great recipe. Easy, fast to make, tasty and cheap. Added a chilly in the sauce to spice it up and some cheese on top when served.

In these tough economic times, I find myself living on staple items like most people. Pasta is something I always have on hand, so I whipped this up for dinner tonight. I scaled the recipe down to four servings (some for dinner tonight, the rest for lunch leftovers tomorrow), left out the salt, and added a bit more garlic since I'm a huge fan of the stuff. Oh, and I used linguine since I didn't have regular spaghetti noodles on hand. This certainly filled me up, and tasted great. Thanks Amanda!

I really liked the flavor, I used small shell pasta instead of spaghetti, and added a little hot sauce and grated cheese. It was really pretty good.

This was good but not much different from tossing spaghetti with just heated pasta sauce, especially garlic-flavored sauce.

Quick easy spaghetti sauce.  Nothing too fancy.  I added a little sugar.

The recipe turned out fine, but it was a lot of fuss for just some extra garlic. It's easy enough to just put a few garlic cloves in your pasta sauce and loads faster.

This made a nice sauce for a pasta side dish.  I made it with some quick parmesean chicken and it went over well.

It's pretty good.  It's super simple, and really it was kinda what I was going to do anyway.  But I thought there was too much olive oil.  Otherwise, it's good.  I always eyeball the seasonings and alter while it's cooking.  Still, all good.

I don't care for the recipe as written, mostly because I don't care for oregano all that well.  I have altered the recipe to meet my tastes a little better - left out the oregano, flavored with salt, pepper, added more minced garlic and diced up some roma tomatoes which I threw into the sauce.

This recipe was really good. I added a bit more tomato sauce into the mixture to make it moist, but there was no need to change anything else. From now on, I'll be using this as my main pasta dish. Thanks!

This was pretty good but a bit bland for us.  I added more seasonings and brown sugar to cut the acid.

my husband and i loved this recipe, i did add about 1/2 tsp of italian seasoning a dash of balsamic vinegar and a can of stewed tomatoes (drained) just to add some chunk to it. We love chunky spagetti. It was a great recipe when the pantry is a lil empty.

We felt that it was missing something... Maybe some other texture like green peppers or something... and maybe one more can of tomato sauce.  Could use a little kick.  But it was very yummy
