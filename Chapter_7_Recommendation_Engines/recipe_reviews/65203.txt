Use the same recipe, just a slightly different cooking technique, from an old Fanny Farmer Cookbook.  It's wonderful!  You can change the sweet/sour ratio by varying the amount of sugar to vinegar.  This stuff is so good I'll eat leftover sauce out of the fridge with a spoon.  It is also tasty on fish, spinach, and esp. corned beef.

This was excellent! I didn't have a double boiler, so I just toss all the ingredients and follow the direction as if I had a double boiler.  This would be a great dip for chicken fingers or as a sandwich spread.

Great sauce! I served it with our Easter ham (14 people) and it was a hit! I used about a quarter less sugar as it was sweet enough.  I think the next time I make it I will add fresh tarragon.

Try this sauce with and old fashioned boiled dinner (corned beef, cabbage, turnip, potatoes, carrots, onions).  

I was glad to find this version after I lost this page from my Fannie Farmer cookbook.  I did find it later and others may like this version, which is not so sweet:

2 Tbsp mustard
1 tsp flour
1 c light cream
1 egg yolk
1 tsp sugar
1/2 c vinegar, hot
salt

Blend mustard, flour and 1/4 c cream.  Heat the remainder of the cream and add the mustard mix to it.  Beat the egg yolk and add to 2 Tbsp of the hot mixture before blending into the pot.  Add the sugar, cook until thickened.  Add vinegar at the end.

Bravo  all I can say...I don't often join sites but had to join allrecipes so I could comment..just the right amount of spice and sweetness, this will become a reg sauce on my menu and if it does become a little to thick for you add a bit of chicken stock  yummy spicy and creamy

This was surprisingly super good but a little thick for my taste. Next time I think I will cut back a bit on the flour but other than that its a good solid recipe and tasted awesome on our ham. I am going to try dipping chicken nuggets in it tomorrow for lunch!

Well, in the end I think I made a completely different sauce, but it was still really good.  I obviously didn't pay close attention to the recipe when I started making it.  I accidentally put 1 cup of SOUR cream.  I also put a squirt of prepared mustard in, mostly for color, and because of the comments here, I cut the flour in half.  Mine was still a little runny, but probably because I used sour cream.  In the end, it still came out very yummy.  A lot spicier then I expected....

This is a sweet/sour sauce with a very mild mustard flavor. It was OK but not what I was expecting. The next time I will cut the vinegar to 1/4 cup, the sugar to 2 or 3 Tablespoons and increase the mustard to at least 3 Tablespoons. I prefer a stronger mustard flavor.

used this as a base for a pizza, and it was perfect. very easy. might add a touch more flour next time so it thickens up a bit more, but overall a great simple sauce!

Very good!  The only thing I might do differently next time is to use a little less flour the next time as it thickens up quickly and forms a skin.

Nice compliment to our Easter ham. Good comments from my guests. Will use this for chicken and pork also.

HUGE hit at the Easter dinner table!  Even though the ham was divine, my dinner guests still loved this sauce enough to pass it around the table.  My husband is looking forward to using it cold as a spread on the bread for leftover ham sandwiches tonight and I think my son who is a connoisseur of chicken strips with honey mustard will love this to dip his chicken in.

Outstanding. This also makes a great dip for chicken fingers. My family loved it with baked ham. The only change I might make is to make it thinner, as it got a "skin" while it sat on the table and had to be stirred.

I added 2 tbsp of water to the finished sauce to adjust the thickness more to my liking.
Served this with pan roasted Brussels sprouts.  
I might make a more piquant version next time by adding a pinch of cayenne

Have been making this every year Christmas for the last few years, since the family always ask me to bring the Mustard Sauce for the Gammon after tasting it the first year.   This recipe is perfect as is!
