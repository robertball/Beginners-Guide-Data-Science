While this recipe is a good base, it is not nutritionally sound. As a holistic nutritionist, I have formally studied pet nutrition. Your recipe needs variety and necessary additions. Try rotating protein sources (chicken, beef, fish,... and once a week supplementing with organs) and adding an omega-3 rich egg (cook the white, serve the yolk raw) at least once per day. You might vary your grains with rolled oats (which I first process to make into a flour, then simply add to food w/ warm broth before serving my dogs' meals), alternated with enriched white rice, long grain brown rice, and medium grain brown rice (cooked LONGER than for human consumption!). Also, add fresh vegetables lightly steamed and mashed such as carrots, squash, sweet potato, yam, peas, etc., and even apples once in awhile. Most importantly, you really should be adding cottage cheese or plain yogurt with every meal. Use a calcium supplement (at least 300 mg daily) and a multi. Adding alfalfa powder or other greens is necessary for cleansing the blood and immune health. Finally, if only one supplement is to be used, a good enzyme for dogs is imperatve. I use a great multi complex by "Only Natural Pet," calcium, alfalfa powder, an Omega 3-6-9 capsule, acidophilus (or other probiotic), and occasionally an enzyme. My dogs are athletes, their health and nutrition are very important!

This is on the right track, but you're leaving out calcium requirements and also the fact that ALOT of dry foods have been affected by this recall. I have my dog on an all natural diet. She 'basically" eats healthy foods that we eat. Everyone that is in the know is aware not to feed certain foods to dogs. I recommend a book by Carol Boyle on natural food for dogs. I have used this way of feeding my dog for two weeks and I can already see a positive difference.

I use this same recipe to feed both of my dogs except that I add three ground Tums to the mixture after it has cooled, per my vet (I believe it has something to do with dogs needing phosphorous???). I have a 7-yr old border collie and a 14-yr old australian shepherd with Cushings disease and they love this.  I often will use ground beef if I don't have ground chicken - but be sure your dog can handle the extra fat without any accidents in the house!

I've used a variation of this recipe for my three dogs.  As other people have commented, it should not be used on a consistent basis.  I have several recipes that I use to mix things up to ensure my dogs get a well rounded diet and nutritional support with vitamin supplaments.  I got most of my recipes from www.wendynanrees.com.  She hosts the Wild Life Talk Radio and is excellent to deal with.  With all the pet food recalls it is a good feeling to know we are feeding our furry friends safe food.  So why not make it balanced as well.

Congratulations on thinking about our "furry kids". My two bichons love this diet. They've been on the exact same thing for 6 years.Sometimes I change it around with turkey or beef liver. At the suggestion of our Vet, I sprinkle in the garlic from one capsule I buy at the health food store. Its just enough to keep the fleas away but won't hurt the "furry kids". Also, to protect joints a bit of bonemeal after the cooking process. I steam the rice and boil the chicken separately. I use a frozen veggie mix with corn, green beans, carrots and peas. Broccoli, brussel sprouts and cauliflower should not be used because it can cause gas in dogs. Thanks for sharing this with everyone LuvsNow17

This is a great, simple recipe.  I changed it a little.  I used ground turkey for the meat (ground chicken would also work), brown rice for the rice (will have to cook a little longer), frozen peas and carrots for the veggies and added 1TBL of bone meal (can get at health food store)for calcium supplement.

This recipe is so good, and very similar to what I cook for my dog every evening.  You can add wheat germ to this recipe, and substitute the chicken with ground round (or other very lean cut of beef) or fish (either farm raised catfish or talapia).  My dog loves this rice, meat, veggies meal.  Try Wacky Mac noodles instead of rice (or tri-color rotini) for a change.  If you are worried your doggy is not getting enough nutrients, buy some pet tabs and give along with meals.  My dog eats a small amount of broccoli in the vegetable mix he gets, but he has never had detectable gas.  I throw it all into an iron skillet, thinly coated with olive oil, and cook for about 12 or so minutes.  Capi says 'Yum'!

Very good recipe, I also put some canned pumpkin in for fiber, per the vet and the dogs and cats both love it.  However, I am afraid to give a supplement to my pets because of the numerous recalls.  How do we know if they are made in America with American processed ingredients?  Is there a human grade supplement to give them?

The recipe is great for a supplemental meal. However I hope the submitter does not mean it for a steady diet because there are vitamins and minerals that dog's require and are not in the recipe. This fact has been stated on the news when they are talking about the Pet Food Recall. However, like I previously stated it is good for a change of pace/treat meal.

I cook "patties" of veggies and meats to mix with our Westie's dry food, but this is definately a change for him. If it is mssing calcium, can dried milk powder be used? (ps he loves broccoli, so we put up with occasional flatulence)

Using a rice cooker makes this even easier!  This is just what I was looking for, thanks for posting it.  I have an easy suggestion...I made the rice in my rice cooker, browned the meat (I used lean organic ground beef) on the stove with just a teaspoon of granulated garlic (for fleas) and water to make a broth, then added the meat mix to the rice cooker when the rice was done.  Add frozen veggies (I buy unsalted peas & carrots, broccoli, and green beans separately bagged so I can control the amount of corn and broccoli :) and keep in rice cooker until everything warms together.  Put in containers and when it's all cooled down, stir in a chopped hard boiled egg or two and some fresh chopped parsley.  OH LA LA!  I do, of course, mix this homemade goodness into their tried and true kibble.  They need that too.  AND, now don't laugh, my husband takes this for work with some Old Bay seasoning.  How can ya lose?

I need to comment on this... 1st...use brown rice 2nd..get a pressure cooker, do an entire chicken... yes, bones too. 3rd...the veggies, add them after the chicken is cooked. Minimal processing... I add liver, & beef or pork, eggs (shells belnded). as a base I use pumpkin, when I find it, and lots of squash.  I save all my chicken bones and scrap food, and add that to the batch in the pressure cooker. Save those potatoe skins all the good stuff and less starch. Barley is also good to use, oatmeal can be used too.  Think about what the food would do for you, and add that information to what you cook and how long you cook it. Think Minimal processing~~~ I think I will subscribe and publish my recipe. I now cook for 2 large boxers. AND no matter what I try, my 2 cats will not eat people food...period! So anyone who has an idea, love to hear it!

I have two dogs,one is quite finicky. I made this recipe using beef, as I had bought a beef last year, and I cannot eat it, too tough for me to chew. The smaller dog, the finicky one, loves this food. I am wondering how much he should have per day, and is he getting all the nutrients that he needs? I notice he has put on weight since I started feeding this to him. I am on a fixed income, so do not want to spend a lot of money on stuff from the vet to supplement. Does anyone have any advice for me?

After having my dog break out in a rash from corn allergy, but trying to save money on the food. Did my first run of it.  Comes down to about a dollar a day to feed both my dogs. ( 70 pound and 15 pound) I read it was recommended to feed 1 cup per 35 pounds body weight, if that helps anyone. I plan on rotating chicken and fish.  For the fish I used tilapia, can tuna, pack of salmon.  I did about a little under half meat then the other half was white and brown rice, potato, eggs scrambled in olive oil, carrot, and brocolli. They absolutely loved it. And I feel so much better feeding them quality food instead of spending 15 dollars on a cheap bag of dog food that's practically all corn, what a rip off.

Please remember not to ever add black pepper to dog food. It can irritate the skin, eyes, nose, and gastrointestinal tract of your dog.

Good recipe.  To make it more nutritionally sound, you could add diced apples, and serve it with a big dallop of whole fat plain yoghurt.  I would also add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil, as dogs need more oil in their diet than we do.

I am so glad that I found this recipe. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly and mixed it with his kibble and my dog LOVED it. Since then, I have changed up the ingredients based on what I have on hand, but follow the 3-3-3 ratio (1/3 meat, 1/3 rice & 1/3 vegetables).
Thanks so much for posting!

I have two shih tzu, and they are the most finicky dogs I've ever had.  They LOVE this!  Finally - something that I don't have to force them to eat!  I mix this half and half with kibble, and they can't get enough!

This is a good basic recipe, although somewhat lacking in some important nutritional elements. I applaud anyone looking for a healthy alternative to store bought canned pet food. I use this basic recipe and tweek it a bit(adding some vitamins and supplements suggested by my vet)for my diabetic dog. I use brown rice (aids digestion, provides nutrients, and considered a whole grain), and a variety of fresh vegetables lightly steamed and chopped. I sometimes cook the rice in organic vegetable/chiken/beef broth to add a little flavor.

I use just about this same recipe. Only I add just a dash of Garlic powder to control the fleas. And I use fresh ground white turkey, canned peas and green beans and brown rice. My dog LOVES her food and whenever I can I mix it up a bit to give her variety.

My 10 Pound dog Cheyenne is a stingy eater.
I made this recipe with carrots instead of mixed vegetables and put it in the blender, after cooking .  She ate every bite and went to her sister Lucy's plate to try and find more.  I did not blend it thoroughly just a little bit.

Wonderfully easy to put together. Even better, my two senior doggies loved this. I made some adjustments, using ground chicken and brown rice. A few reviewers expressed concern about not satisfying all nutritional needs, but there is no food that I know of that provides everything, which is why I give my dogs supplements.

With a minor variation in ingredients, I've fed my dogs this recipe a couple times a month for many years.  I've not put veggies in (will try it!), but do mince a couple cloves of garlic, cook it with the rice, and mix in cooked, shredded chicken.  The "kids" love it, and the added garlic is a great flea deterrent - have never had a flea issue!

I saw many reviewers worried about their children... or animals ha ha, not receiving the proper nutrition or being on a fixed income.  After reading the nutritionist's (Kim)review I was hesitant and almost didn't recall the recipe description also says, "combined with a kibble" as well as the recipe was for people worried about dog food recall.  This recipe is a low cost and decent substitution.  Also, mixing this with his regular food has made food last twice as long.  My dog has severe skin allergies and he hasn't broke out with this food!  Not recommended for a good regular diet as Kim stated, but if you need cheap and temporary food, good choice.  :)

My dogs both look forward to this meal every afternoon. I supplement their diet with doggy vitamins and I use brown rice. This is a great "base" recipe in which one can build off of easily.

I made this for my 14 year old English setter when the dog food recall seemed so widespread.  She absolutely loves it!  I put it into freezer containers and freeze it, pulling it out as needed.  The next time I make it, I am going to use low sodium chicken broth instead of the water for a little more flavor, although my dog LOVES it just as the recipes call for it to be made.

Its close to what I make for my little cocker spaniel every week! The only thing is, I vary the vegetables (peas, spinach, sweet potato, apple, carrots, celery,whatever is coming in fresh in our garden that dogs can have) because just like humans, dogs do not digest corn so it seemed useless to give them it! When I originally was looking for a recipe though, this is a great base to start at!

While my poodle would love to have a constant diet of chicken, there does need to be some variety.  Also, it seems as if some reviewers are taking better care of their pets than themselves! I don't think this recipe is meant to be the only thing that the dog eats (it does say mix with kibble, hopefully a higher end nutritious one!) Thanks for the recipe!

My golden retriever Leonidas normally hates wet dog food and he won't touch it or even go near it but I cooked this for the first time and substituted the chicken for his favorite thing in the world, beef, then I added some eggs,  and he absolutely DEMOLISHED this food. He will most definitely be eating this from now on. Thank you

That is basically what we feed our dog except we add in a can of sweet potatoes or yams to go with the peas and carrots.

Hello,
I have decided to start making my dogs' dog food, and I was wondering if anybody had some really good advice, based on experience as what to do, how to switch them, and how much variety a dog should have in their diet.  thank you so much.
my e-mail is metzge22@msu.edu.

Thank you,
Jessie

This is a great starting point. My husband and I have cooked for our dogs for over a year we make about 20-25 pounds at a time and freeze in 1 week portions. We use chicken, squash, or yams some kind of veggie, brown rice, hard boiled eggs, pearl barley and we save all our egg shells and grind them up and add the powder. We also add an omega-3 oil made for dogs daily. I am going to try something new couscous, it's high in protein and fiber in place of the brown rice. We also give them kibble and plain yogurt with each meal. Our dogs are in excellent health. We just had our 1 year old lab spayed and 16 days after surgery you could barely see the scar! Good luck feeding your best friend the best food!

I liked the overall idea of making this for my dog that has been having some runny symptoms from her medication, but I would've liked to have know in the recipe whether the so called "minced chicken" was cooked or raw. Because I'm currently at the stage of cooking everything for a 1/2 hour more than it says on the recipe because of the raw chicken pieces left over. Hoping it won't turn into a complete disaster *fingers crossed*

This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. My border collie has an insulinoma, and needs a high protein, high carb diet. I add some of her dry dog food to this and she loves it, so does my other dog. I have noticed that her hypoglycemia is less intense than it was and I have only had them on this for 1 week. thank you.

I have made this dog food many times for my dog.  Unfortunately I was having a problem with the rice burning on the bottom.  So I switched it up a bit and have had no more problems with burnt rice ever since.  First I add water to the pot and heat until boiling.  Then I add the frozen veggies and stir.  When it stars to boil again I add the cut up chicken.  Finally, when that starts to boil I add the rice.  Stir briefly and then put on the lid, lower the heat, and simmer for the 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Works great!

I make this . I don't do anything in the oven .. I add pumpkin. It's very good for their digestion. Don't ever switch your dog over all at once!   
My dog has Cushing  and the doctors can't believe how we'll she said doing. She  couldn't handle the RX so we went all natural!  She's like a puppy again! 
We also had our doctor order " Jing-Tang" herbal pills.  He hair has grown back, and she really spunky again. Blood work went backwards from "bad" to "good" !

I make this frequently in large batches, then freeze it in three day portions.  I sometimes use brown rice, lots of carrots, chicken and peas.  I have added lentils for variety.  Our  8 year old, 84 pound yellow lab  likes it. She is healthy, smart and active.  Serves as a "service dog" for an older family member.  I still use some dry kibble of good quality, but rely on a good serving each day of the homemade food.

Rating 4 stars only because I wish the recipe had specified a little more. It's a good basic recipe as a bland diet for when our fur babies’ tummy's are upset. I boiled 3 chicken breasts (boneless and skinless) for about 30 minutes--covered the breasts with more than enough water.  Shred/Chop/Mince the chicken breasts in a chopper (I used a Ninja) and transfer to a large bowl—not the dog bowl…a bowl large enough to mix in the remaining cooked ingredients. Cooked white rice (jasmine) over low heat for 20 minutes in a separate pot using liquid from boiled chicken (rice to liquid measured according to recipe). NOTE: I would have used brown rice and cooked longer in more liquid, but I ran out of brown rice. Boiled frozen mixed vegetables (carrot, peas, green beans) in same pot, in remaining liquid/broth for about 10-12 minutes over medium-low heat. Mixed vegetables might contain corn, I removed the corn by hand. Used a slotted spoon to skim out the vegetables into my Ninja blender and pureed it. Transferred veggies to large bowl and mixed in the rice when finish. I put the servings for my dogs in a 2 separate bowls in the fridge to cool down faster. This recipe made a lot, which is great. I ended up mixing in about 1.5 cups cooked white rice.

Our sweet dog, is very old and not always wanting her regular food and having tummy issues, so this is a good alternative during those times.  She gobbles this stuff up!

 I ended up having to add at least 2 more cups of water, my rice soaked the called for amount up very quickly.  I also add water to leftovers as I serve her, the moisture is good.  I may add more chicken next time for more protein, this makes a ton of rice.  with these minor changes, I highly recommend!

This recipe is great. I needed to make some bland food for my dog for a couple of days to get him feeling better (vets recommendation) and this was perfect. My dog gobbled it up and just loved it! This will be a good recipe to have in my back pocket. I did make it without the veggies (vets recommendation) to be extra easy on my little guys stomach.

My pup hasn't been eating his own dog food. I have tried different brands of kibble from expensive to MORE expensive and nothing. Tried can dog food and he ate it for a bit but his tummy didnt like it. Poor boy. 
Found this recipe and I have6 made it twice now (I cut the recipe in half cause my baby is a Chiweenie and i was wasting too much due to his tummy size.
Well i have added apples and this last time I added sweet potato and he loves it!!!  I will continue made this while I switch up veggies to keep the variety up.

This is a great meal.  We put all fresh vegetables bought from the local road side stands of neighbors and the amish.  We included zucchini, yellow squash, celery, carrots, and broccoli. Instead of 6-1/2 cups water, we used 4 cups bone broth we made from the chickens.  Bone broth has a LOT of vitamins and minerals, including glucosamine and chondroitin.  We also used only 3 cups Long Grain Brown Rice instead of white.  AND we have always given garlic in small quantities to our Labs. This keeps away fleas.  I read all the time where others say garlic is toxic to dogs. Well, it IS also toxic to people, yet we eat it.  As long as you do not overdue it on the garlic, it is fine.  An article I read said one clove for a large breed. Clove sizes vary greatly! We put in about a teaspoon for the entire amount. My one dog is diabetic.  Since being on this food her insulin levels have been 150 points lower. She still gets insulin but less.  They are now on day 2 of this dog food.   I also entered the nutrients used in this recipe into a nutrient calculator online.  It gives most of what they need per day. We mixed with a 1/4 amount of their grain free holistic dog food for added crunch.  As a snack to keep teeth clean, we give raw carrots.  We still will give them a supplement. Human grade for works just as well as pet grade per my vet.

Update: 11/18/18 - We are nearly approaching month 3 of this dog food. Our dogs look FABULOUS!!! When we make this, as another gentleman said, rice wil

I used a mix of ground turkey and ground beef . I also used a Minute Rice Medley with quinoa, brown, red and wild rice. Add the water the rice recipe calls for. The dogs love it and I feel good giving them real food.

I make a similar recipe. I then press it into muffin tins, freeze it then remove and keep them in a freezer bag. Then I thaw one at a time to stir in with his regular (quality) kibble to break up the monotony. He loves it.

Ever since I started cooking for my dog, Lab/Shepard Mix he doesn't shed as much and I believe he actually smiles at me after I feed him. Yes, I make this recipe. I also make it with chicken and liver. I ordered powdered vitamins for dogs from a website company called Dinovite. Does anyone else use this? Any comments? Any other suggestions? Thank you.
