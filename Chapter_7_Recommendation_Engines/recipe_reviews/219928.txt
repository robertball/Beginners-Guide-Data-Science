Made this last week but I wasn't able to post on my iPad. )-:  Do not buy white hominy with this dish. It was so ugly on the plate.  All white.  If you are trying to introduce people to hominy, this might do it. It's good for kids IMO but it lacked umph for me.  Maybe some vegetables, green onion?  Also, there was no size of pork so how can you cook it for an hour without the pork being rubber?  I could see this used with a pork loin.  there was plenty of sauce left over.

This is one of my favorite casseroles.  Like another reviewer, I cut the pork chops into bite size pieces before baking just to make serving easier.  Yellow hominy definitely makes a prettier presentation than white though the taste is the same either way.  I used to have a recipe from a book for this casserole and I'm sure it called for onions and bell peppers .  That would add to the color.  And, if you combine the soup and the water in the pork browning pan, it makes the "gravy" sort of brown which also adds color.

Loved it! I used yellow hominy and it turned out great. I also chopped up my pork chops before putting them in the casserole to make serving a bit easier.
