This was a good recipe to use out the last of our Easter ham.  I read all the reviews before trying it and took a few of the suggestions.  I peeled and microwaved my potatoes in a covered dish with a few tablespoons of water until they were mostly cooked.  I added water to the soup instead of milk, to cut some fat and calories.  I didn't even miss it - the soup was creamy enough on its own.  And I added about 1 1/2 cup of frozen peas, a generous amount of black pepper and onion powder (don't care for big chunks of onion!)  Rather than doing layers, I just mixed everything together then spread it over the sliced potatoes.  

Pre-cooking the potatoes was a huge time saver.  I baked the casserole for 25 minutes, then topped it with a few slices of swiss cheese and baked another 6 minutes until it was all melty and bubbly.

I can see how some could find this bland - I really did hit this with a lot of black pepper, even adding more on top once it was on my plate.  But the flavors all went really nicely together and my husband and I both enjoyed this meal.  I will definitely use this recipe again the next time I have leftover ham.

I loved this casserole but instead of using celery soup, I made my own sauce.  2 T butter, 2 T flour, 1/4 cup half & half, 3/4 cup skim mlk and 1/2 cup vegetable broth.  Sauted flour in melted butter over medium heat. Added milks and broth, and cooked until thickened.  Seasoned with salt and herb blend (like basil, thyme, oregano, etc.) and lots of pepper.   Yummy!

Very good and very easy recipe.  Also works with smoked turkey.  A lot of people complained about the potatoes taking forever to cook.  I used a grater and sliced them thin, scalloped potato style.  Followed the directions from there and it turned out fine!!

Great recipe!  We don't like things too salty so I doubled the amount of potatoes and milk which made it just right.  I also added 3 cloves of minced garlic and topped the casserole with cheddar cheese and French fried onion rings. Delicious!

I made this tonight for the first time, but made modifications to the original recipe.  I think the original would have rated a 3 due to some blandness of flavor.  With my modifications, I give it a 4-5.  I used a V-slicer on the 'fine' setting to slice the potatoes & onions.  I sauteed the onions until golden brown, then added the soup & milk and brought it to a simmer.  Then I added 1 small crown of broccoli chopped fine (using V-slicer on stems) & simmered for 5 min.  I layered the sauce, potatoes, & ham in a glass casserole dish (10" across) 'lasagna style' with 4 oz shredded pepper-jack cheese (there were 3 layers each of potatoes, ham, sauce & cheese).  Baked as directed.  Topped at the end with 1/2 cup Panko breadcrumbs mixed with 1 tbsp melted butter & 1/4 cup Parmesan.  It turned out wonderfully; lots of flavor & fully cooked.

Very tasty. I doubled the recipe, but used only one onion. Like someone else who reviewed this recipe, I added a little (about 2-3 ozs.) of grated cheddar before adding the ham. Cooked it exactly as directed, and it was delicious. My 13-year-old daughter (my pickiest eater) loved it and told me I had to make it again.

I used Honey Baked Ham with this & used cream of chicken soup.  I also used cheddar cheese instead of Parmesan.  Very good!  I liked the mixture of onion with potato taste.

I read the reviews first,so precooked the potatoes & onions in the microwave, then layered the diced ham over that, then a generous layer of shredded cheese, poured over the sauce-used cream of mushroom w/roasted garlic,+ some more minced garlic, then sprinkled some It. bread crumbs over the top. Baked for 1/2 an hour. The potatoes could  have been cooked a little more-(I used 4 big ones), but the reheating of the left-overs will take care of that.  We really liked this & I would do it again. Thanks, Dottie

Great recipe!  I used red onions and cream of mushroom & roasted garlic soup.  I also halved the ham and added over a cup of sliced mushrooms.  I mixed together the onions and potatoes and microwaved them until the potatoes were done.  Then I mixed all else in and put in the oven for 20 minutes.  Also - I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk and sprinked with crushed Ritz crackers and some shredded mozarella cheese before putting in the oven.  Will use again!!!!

My husband gives it 5 stars, I give it 3 so I compromised on 4. I sliced my onion and potatoes very thin and it still took forever to cook.  My hubby said it was even better as leftovers.  I would make again though just for him.

I thought this dish was very flavorful.  Things I did different were:  I sprinkled the pepper on the potatoes along with Mrs. Dash.  Also I used white onion and swiss cheese slices.  I only put the dish back in the oven for 5-10 more minutes to melt that, then let stand for 5 minutes.

I made a larger batch.  I also added frozen peas, green beans and corn.  Also added cheddar cheese and put crushed Ritz crackers on top.  This was very good.

as simple as this is..it is still amazing! I tire of making my husbands favorite standby-fried ham and potatoes-and decided to try this instead. I used green onions and just plain forgot the parm cheese..and it didnt matter.  extremely flavorful. if pressed for  prep time and ingredients, do yourself a favor and try this dish!

I bought a ham on sale and spread it out to 5 dinners... and this one was one of the best. It's great for using leftover ham on a low budget. For those of you having problems with the potatoes not cooking... did you double it? If you slice the potatoes thin (I didn't even use a slicer) and use the amount of potatoes specified they should cook in about 40 minutes to an hour like the recipe says. I added cheddar cheese and seasoned breadcrumbs to the top. YUM!

The only problem was that there wasn't enough!  Next time I'll double, perhaps triple and use larger dish of course.  I used Cheddar instead of Parm, and added bread crumbs on top for the last 20 minutes of cooking.

DELICIOUS and easy!  I made this recipe exactly as written and my husband and I enjoyed it immensely.  A great way to use up leftover ham from the holiday.  We will make this again!

This was good. Made it as is except I used more ham than called for and I subbed the Parmesan for Cheddar. I noticed some reviews said the potatoes weren't done. I sliced mine kind of thin. I had no problem with them. Even the onions were sliced kind of thin. This is not a quick dinner. Putting it together didn't take long, but the baking time does. Will surely make this one again!

I rated this "the best" because it was an easy and new option for leftover ham that didn't require any fru-fru spices or fancy wines or vinigrettes - and even I had each of the ingredients.
   The kicker is it was absolutely delicious and I would try it with fresh ham, too - not just leftovers. (I don't want to eat something else while I'm waiting to make this dish. >^,,^

Not bad. I would highly recommend using a low-sodium cream of celery soup if your ham is already a little salty b/c you can always add a dash of salt if need be but you can't take it away once its already there. I did layer a little cheddar cheese over the potatoes (but under the ham) which also may have attributed to the saltiness. Also, I sliced the potatoes REALLY thin and baking times were done in the time allotted. Overall, glad I gave it a try but not sure if I'll make it again.

I gave this 4 stars because the kids and I like it, my husband didn't care for it, but it was mostly the onions and celery flavor he didn't like. I will make this again and try chopping and saute the onions first, and I would use cream of mushroom soup.  Also, I didn't like that the ham seemed really dry. Maybe if I added it half way through the first hour it wouldn't be so dry.

My husband liked it a lot. I thought it was alright, but was missing something. I'll make it again and try adding chopped broccoli or asparagus.   Instead of sliced potatoes I used frozen hash browns and had no issues with them not being cooked enough. The casserole wasn't dry at all.

Just kind of ok. It had to cook much longer (almost 2 hours) and my potatoes were sliced in my food processor, like potato chip thickness. If I made it again I would add some heavy cream or butter.

I'm giving this 5 stars based on the way I prepared/cooked it.
I didn't have cream of celery so I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic.  I used 4 potatoes (smaller ones) and 2.5 cups of ham.  I ccoked the potatoes in the microwave first as many others suggested.  I first cooked them for a few minutes with a 1/4c of water.  Then I added the soup to the potatoes along with pepper and some more water.  Once the potatoes were done I added some cheese (american and cheddar shredded) and then the ham.  I mixed it all togther instead of layering and cooked for 20 minutes.  It turned out great!  I did add more cheese and some frenchs onions on top (no sliced onion was added as my husband doesn't like it added onion powder instead) then cooked for 6 more minutes.  It was a hit!

This was great.  My family is somewhat picky and everyone ate their share.  After reading reviews, I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of celery (we're mushroomy people) and I, too, put a layer of shredded monterrey jack cheese under the ham.  It was awesome.  The onion I used was way too big and I could have gotten away with only half an onion.  It was a bit salty with the ham, maybe low sodium soup next time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe, I made a few changes: I used mushroom soup instead of celery, I also added some carrots, and used a mixture of cheddar and Swiss cheese. Great change and very good easy meal.

I added frozen brocoli to this, along with some shredded pepper jack cheese and a little leftover vegetable stock that I had.  I added a sliced tomato and chopped up two garlic gloves.  I sprinkled some bread crumbs on the top with the parmesan cheese.  I think I used 3-4 sliced potatoes.  The first time, I actually parboiled the sliced potatoes, which cut the baking time back quite a bit.  It was a huge hit with the family, though and great use of leftover ham.

For someone like me, I appreciate the change from heated leftovers. I think this is a great wrap up dish and applaud you for putting it out there for the rest of us.  In these times you can not be timid. My husband loved it, the simplicity of the ingredients and the fact they are staples in our home saved me a trip to the grocery store and throwing out perfectly good leftovers. Bravo, Bravo from a f/t working Mom and loving Wife.

My family of non-casserole fans LOVED this!  I sliced the potatoes, leaving the peelings on, and used onion and garlic powder, since my kids don't like "chunks" of onions. I mixed all of it together with some American cheese (it was all I had besides a small amt of parmesan) before putting it in the baking dish. My family loved this so much when I made it last week that I'm making it again tonight!  I think it would be good with green beans mixed in, too.  Anyway, thanks for a great recipe!:)

I wanted to give this 5 stars, but I did tweak it a bit and, like other reviewers, found it still a little salty, so I'll keep tweaking. I used cream of mushroom and added the crushed Ritz crackers and mozzarella cheese on top (then topped with the parmesan) for the last 20 minutes. I sliced the potatoes quite thin, so they were done within the suggested cooking time (an hour and 20 minutes total). I took it to a potluck and it was the most popular dish there. So I'll make this again, but probably with another potato. The saltiness wasn't unbearable, just noticeable. Still, a yummy success.

I used Cream of Broccoli and added more potatoes. It didnt seem to make very much. We are a family of 4 and there was enough to make it around just once. I would probably double it next time and add even more milk.

Initially out of the oven I was skeptical of this, it was really good! Even my kids (6 & 4) cleaned their plates. I used cream of mushroom soup and boiled my potatos first to cut down on the cook time. I really liked the way the ham came out a little crispy from being on top, yum! We'll make this again for sure.

Just what I needed for using leftover Christmas ham.  I used cream of potato soup (don't care for cream of celery) and at least a cup of milk, maybe more, because I really didn't think there was enough liquid.  Also used a cup or more of shredded cheddar cheese, layered in with potatoes and ham, as well as on top.  Turned out well, especially considering how sick of ham we are!

just made this last night and most of my guests had seconds, some thirds!  I substituted the parmeson for grated asiago and added canned peas.
Delicious comfort food! Oh and I microwaved the potatoes first as some suggested.  Small potates - 2 minutes in the microwave - saved me 25 min in the oven.

My husband and I really liked this recipe, it being 110 degrees w/the heat index I really didn't want to have the oven going for over an hour so i boiled the potatoes, softened the onions in a bit of onion grease, so it only took 30 minutes at 350. I also added cheddard and crumbled some nice crisp bacon on the top, used cream of mushroom instead of celery (not a huge fan)  and baked in a covered pyrex dish. Super good!! Will be awesome in the cooler months, just sooo tired of b-b-q that this was a nice change!! tx much

Very easy recipe. Tasted great but found it to be a bit "mushy". I will try it again, but use extra and thicker cut potatoes.

This was a good recipe for leftover ham.  I think the flavor depends on the quality of the ham.  Based on another review, I sliced the potatoes very thin, added 1/2 cup of milk on top and microwaved it for 10 minutes.  Then I cooked it in the oven until it was hot enough (about 20 minutes).

I found the amount of onion to be to much - will halve it next time.  I also added some garlic, Essence of Emeril, and a dash or two of Crystal hot sauce.  Easy enough to make and except for the onion, was well liked

Surprisingly good!  I will definitely make again whenI have leftover ham, but I didn't think it was enough to be served as the main dinner.  It needs something to go along with it.

Quick, easy and very adaptable. I highly recommend that you par-cook the potatoes in the micro for about 3 minutes.  Even doing that the recipe still took the recommended time.

This was so good! I doubled the recipe. I used baby white and red potatoes. I sauteed the onion and that added so much flavor. I also added a can of corn. I used cheddar cheese because thats what I had on hand (I added it on top the last 30 minutes). This is a very versatile recipe. My husband loved it!!!  Thanks for a great dish.

I REALLY liked this! I did not "tweak" it too awful much-but I did toss in the green beans that were leftover from Thanksgiving, too! I put 'em in after the potato layer. They were just simple green beans, cooked with bacon pieces&onion...used cream of mushroom soup, too. It was even better the next day! Thanks, it was great!

I thought this was really missing something, but, my husband loved it and said it was perfect. I used cream of mushroom soup, added a can of mushrooms, a little bit of garlic powder, used honey baked ham and lots of shredded cheese on top. I only used about a quarter of an onion, thinly sliced. I cooked the potatos ahead of time in the microwave. When I went to slice them, they were mushy and ended up being more like mashed potatos. I would make this again, once I can figure out the extra something that I felt it was missing...All in all, it was good, easy, used all of my left over ham and there were no left overs.

Very good!  I omitted the onion and used onion powder (probably could have skipped that) and french fried onions in and on top.  Great with a side of canned grean beans.  Doesn't make a lot - will probably double recipe next time.

This is a great change-of-habit recipe for ham. I used the Tyson "heat-n-eat" ham, which is in a maple glaze sauce, and that added a nice sweetness that the kids liked. I also added about 1 c. mixed frozen (thawed) veggies and used minced garlic and finely chopped onions, which I sweated first. I made this up ahead of time to be able to pop into the oven later...I even pre-cooked the potatoes, but they came out a bit "al dente" (I probably will slice them, like it calls for, instead of cubing next time!). I had to use a 3 qt dish, as the recipe was greatly increased by the veggies and potatoes. Served with fresh bread, this was a VERY hearty meal and I'm sure I will make it again. It would even make an excellent pot pie by adding a crust :-)

I thought this meal turned out great, my husband also said he liked it. For some reason, my kids wouldn't touch it. (???) Don't quite understand why not. Was very easy to make. I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery, and I added another potato. I also cooked the potato slices and onion in the mircowave before baking the dish. This cut the cooking time a lot.  Ended up topping it with cheddar cheese instead of parmesean.

I am sure I will make it again, even though my kids didn't like it. It was simple and my husband enjoyed it.

Very good use for the last of the ham...and tasty.  I recommend adding some seasoning (Tony's or salt and pepper) in between the layers of potato.

I used left over baked potato and added sliced olives. I also used cream of chicken soup because that's what I had in my pantry.  Very tasty!

I used leftover mashed potatoes (because that's what I had) instead of sliced, and I sauteed the onion in a little butter before putting this all together.  I also added some cheddar cheese on top. It was simple and very good.  My little ones really liked it, as well as my husband.

I used cream of potato soup, but otherwise made the recipe as listed.  Came out great, a wonderful comfort food that is a good use for the leftover Christmas ham!  Will make again!

The whole family enjoyed this!  I added no salt since our leftover smoked ham was so salty already. Then I used cream of chicken soup and added a layer of cheddar cheese above the potatoes.  I also microwaved the potatoes ahead of time which reduced the baking time by half.  Thanks so much!

This was excellent!  I didn't have cream of celery, so I used the cream of mushroom with roasted garlic that was suggested by an earlier reviewer - will definitely make this again!

Very good and easy. My whole family loved it. I cooked potatoes in microwave until almost done before slicing. I used a cheddar blend for the cheese and only cooked it about 20 minutes covered and then 20-30 uncovered to brown the cheese. Yum!

Great recipe, my family really liked it. Super easy to make. I made the mistake of slicing the potatoes too thin. If they had been chunkier it would have given a little better texture. Also, the ham makes this a little too salty for my taste. Next time I will try to make it with a low sodium celery soup.

I don't really care for ham, and dislike it in big, thick slices, the way my husband loves it. This recipe made us both happy! I've made it 4 times, and I've altered it a bit, by adding cheddar and/or jack to the parmesan. I also add extra soup and milk, and ladle the finished dish over garlic croutons placed at the bottom of a bowl, which soaks up the excess sauce. Spectacular!!

This was a "keeper" per my husband.  I used Sharp cheddar and sliced potatoes very thin.  I decided not to layer, but rather just mixed all items (other than cheese) & put into covered casserole.  No salt necessary, as ham takes care of that.  However, I did put in a significant amt of pepper as indicated in recipe directions, and it was sufficiently spiced for us.

This was a good way to use up the holiday ham - followed the recipe exactly.  Very good, but I wasn't wild about it.   Next time will use cream of chicken soup as one review suggested.

This came out very good, I took the advice of many who wrote in their comments to slice the potatoes and onions very thin. I didn't change anything about the recipe. I will definitely make this again, it was a great way to use up some of the ham we had left over after Easter dinner.

The cooking time for me was not 1:20, it's more like 2 hours for the potatoes to be fully cooked. I took it out originally at 1hr, uncovered it and cooked 25 more minutes, and let it cool 20 minutes. The potatoes were still pretty hard. Maybe it's bc I live at a higher altitude? Who knows, but had to throw it back in the oven. The potatoes were sliced very thin too. Overall, it's very tasty and perfect for a cold day of watching football.

We were all very happy. We took suggestions from others and sliced the potatoes very thin. We had cream of mushroom on hand. We had Swiss cheese so used that on top. It was very good. Pan literally picked cleaned.

I made a couple of alterations.  I used cream of mushroom instead of celery, put shredded cheddar cheese on top along with bread crumbs. added plenty of black pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. It was delicious, my kids loved it even my picky eater loved it. Will make again.

We loved this!  I used Cream of Chicken soup as that was what I had in the pantry.  I sliced the potatoes very thin so they were done when it was finished.  I used both grated Parmesan cheese and Cheddar on the top, it was perfect!  A great dish for dinner on a frigid Winter night!

I have made this recipe in the past and my boys (young at the time) and my husband said it was okay.  Yesterday, I happened to have some leftover baked ham and some garlic mashed potatoes, but no cream of celery soup.  So here's what I did: in a large bowl, combined 1 can of cream of potato soup, milk, and black pepper.  Sauteed chopped onion and celery in olive oil and a little butter.  Added onion celery mix to bowl.  Mixed well. Into a 7x11" casserole dish sprayed with cooking spray, layered chopped ham, then soup mixture, then leftover garlic mashed potatoes.  Added shredded cheddar cheese, then baked until heated through, then added shredded parmesan cheese.  Popped it back in the oven for a few minutes.  Much better.  My husband and son each ate two bowlfuls.

I made this last night using  gluten free flour in the canned soup substitute recipe from Barbara's review of this recipe.  My husband and I just loved it! After reading reviews I did slice the potatoes fairly thinly and it was tender and delicious.  The Parmesan cheese was a perfect topping.

We really liked this allot!! I doubled the recipe & used 1 can cream of celery, & 1 cream of mushroom. Put some precooked frozen vegies over the ham...otherwise followed the recipe. After an hour, center potatoes weren't as done as the outer edges...so I stirred it all around, added parmesean dotted with about 1/4 cup margarine& returned to the oven as recipe said...It was Yummy!! Think I'll be doing this again..!! Thanks for the idea!!

This is so simple and great way to use up left over ham.  I used o'brien potatoes so onion and peppers were already there. I also added peas, Parmesan cheese, then cheddar cheese on top.  Very tasteful!! Family really enjoyed.

I cooked this tonight and it was a prize. Used the last of my Honey-Baked Ham. Here is how I modified it because I was out of some ingredients. I used sweet potatoes in place of regular potatoes; added 2/3c of frozen peas; cream of mushroom soup in place of celery soup; chopped celery fine; added chicken broth to increase liquid; microwaved for 20 minutes then put in oven for 20 minutes. I should have added more ham... (next time). This recipe is a keeper.  Yummy!!!!

This was much better after it set in the fridge for a couple days after cooking to let the flavors meld. I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery. Good dinner, but not the greatest.

Made it as written and it was pretty good. Only issue was the ham on top got a little dry so next time will cover with shredded cheddar or jack cheese before baking as well as the parmesan prior to finish.  Will add some parmesan in with the soup/milk mixture to add a little more zest.

Great recipe for leftover ham.  I had so much extra ham in the freezer that I doubled it.  I also added two heads of broccoli from the farmers market.  I sautéed them lightly with the onions.  I would add a couple extra potatoes next time too.  Like previous reviewers I sliced the potatoes thin and microwaved them for about 3 minutes to get them started and I had no problem with crunchy potatoes.  Yummy will definitely make again!

This was a decent dish with everything that I needed to use up. It was a bit on the salty side but most dishes made with cream soups are. We'll make it again. :)

Extremely salty! Took almost 2 1/2 hrs to cook the potatoes completely.

Tasty. Only change I made was that I reduced the amount of onion (I'm not a huge onion fan). It took a while, but tasted pretty good. Best part about it was that it got rid of the last of the Christmas ham!

Your recipe was okay with my family, it just wasn't as good as I thought it would turn out.  But I still give you my thanks for sharing it.

I made the mistake of following the recipe exactly as written. Way too salty!  I wish I had read the reviews before making it so I could have used a low salt cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of celery soup.  Also I would have used a different cheese as the Parmesan just added to the saltiness.  I won't be making this again.

Yummy. I sliced my potatoes very thinly, so I did not need to precook them. I added some Mrs.Dash to perk it up.

I am grateful for others that take the time to make a note about their experience with a recipe. This is another great example how others made a difference to this dish otherwise I am not sure if my family would of appreciated it as much. I used cream of mushroom soup with 3/4 cup of milk (we like creamy anything) and also pre cooked a few extra potatoes in the microwave while using up the rest of mashed potatoes.I sliced them thick to attempt to add a little bit of texture as I was sure the mashed potatoes would turn this into a mashed something casserole. I added a full can of green beans in the layers and a handful of bread crumbs on top and all sorts of extra seasoning specifically Ms.Dash,  and fresh ground pepper. I also used about 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese before topping off the top with 2 cups of ham. I did not pre cook my onions and only used half (kids don't like big chunks of onion usually) and knew that they would add  a bit crunch which added some great texture for husband and I. This is a great recipe for left over's and believe you can mix it up any way you want...I did, thanks again.

It was good but not good enough for a repeat.  Had a regular taste, nothing out of the ordinary.

This is an easy way to use up left-over ham. Tastes great on a chilly evening! I loved it; comfort food at it's best, in my opinion. Very similar, but better, than a version my mother used to make.

We enjoyed this casserole, as it's very easy to make.  I added asparagus spears, which added a little something extra.

Loved this recipe.  I did use a can of cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of celery as I didn't have anything else on hand.  It was great.  Kids loved it too!  Thanks.

Made this in large quantity for 45 servings, then was served for our Wed. night dinner at church.  Many raves!  Had to give the recipe to a few people.
