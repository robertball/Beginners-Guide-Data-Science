Was not a fan in any way there was way too much salad dressing in it I'm not sure what the point of the sugar in the vinegar were but they definitely did not make it taste better it tasted way way too sweet.  the blend of flavors just. Did not work together and yeah everybody in my family opted for a grilled cheese sandwich instead

This was ok. Too sweet for my tastes, so I would either cut down or delete the sugar all together (the Miracle Whip is sweet enough, IMO).  I used Light Miracle Whip...I did eat it, but I most likely wont be making it again. Thanks for sharing. :)
