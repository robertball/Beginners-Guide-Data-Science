Liked this a lot. I made as described except that I didn't have sourdough bread so I used Italian bread, and I used the breast from a rotissary chicken, skin removed, instead of cooking raw chicken breasts. My chipotle peppers in adobo must have been weak ones because the sandwich wasn't all that spicy.  Next time I will check to make sure the chipotle/mayo sauce is good and spicy before I put it on the sandwich.

We really liked this sandwich especially the chipotle mayo. I will make this again.
