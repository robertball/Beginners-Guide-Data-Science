These brownies were fabulous.  I wasn't sure what kind of delicious brownie mix to buy (they all look good), so I choose one with the extra chocolate packet ;)

I added a bit more peanut butter, cream cheese, and a tad more oil and they turned out to be fabulous-not greasy as I was worried. Also, I added milk choc. chips and peanut butter chips (mixed bag)which added flavor and texture.  My husband went crazy over them and I know the whole batch will be gone within 48 hours!

I omitted the nuts as well. I added a bit more pb. These were good. Very rich. The only negative...I thought they came out a little greasier than the usual brownie but they were pretty good and a nice change of pace from the usual boxed brownie mix.

I chose this recipe because I wanted something quick and easy made with ingredients on hand. These brownies don't slap you with peanut butter flavor, but it is definitely there and they aren't bad. I didn't use the chopped nuts because I didn't have any, but I thought the result wasn't affected by that. I was surprised that the brownies came out more cakelike than fudgy, despite the "fudgy" recipe ingredient levels, but then I thought abut it and the peeanut butter cream cheese filling adds an extra egg to the mixture, so that would logically mean a more cakelike result. I might try it again but add only one egg to the brownie mix and 1/2 cup of water to see if the results were moister. My husband didn't like the way it came out as written.

Chocolate 'n' Peanut Butter. You just can't lose!  The changes I made:  Five oz Neufchatel.  One cup of RF PB.  2 extra tbs sugar.  Omitted the egg in that mix, and added a big ole' globber of butter instead. Omitted the peanuts, but subbed in a handful or so of mini-chocolate chips on top of the swirled batter.  Pulled these a bit early, so they'd be extra ooey-gooey.  Wonderful fresh outta the oven - all fally aparty warm goodness, and even better chilled.  I'm in trouble...

These turned out great. I did end up adding more peanut butter. I also "swirled" by dropping in peanut butter mixture a  little at a time, rather than trying to swirl it all at once. Thanks for the recipe!

When I made these, I took everyone's advice and used one cup of peanut butter and maybe 5 ounces of cream cheese (estimated). They did leave enough "grease" on your hands to warrant a napkin but no one seemed to mind! I have gotten more compliments on these than anything else I've ever made!

I made these for my son and his driving partner last week. I used two boxes of brownie mix, 1 cup of creamy peanut butter, 1 egg......and only 2 jumbo eggs with the 2 boxes of mix, the rest of the recipe I used as printed. He texted  me after they had driven off, and said "good lord mom, these brownies are unreal!!!" I'm getting ready to make another 13 by9 pan of them again for a Christmas buffet. Thanks Wendy for sharing!!

I used 1 cup of chunky PB and 5 oz. cream cheese as another reviewer suggested, and omitted one egg from the filling.  I also added a teaspoon of Mexican vanilla... turned out awesome!  YUM!

Too cakelike and less fudgy than I wanted them to be.  Also for some reason the layers did not meld together very well.  This is likely my fault as this got tried late at night when I was extremely tired and distracted.  They were tasty though, so I do want to try them again.

Weren't really chewy like brownies should be.  Cake-like consistency... but still good tasting.

This recipe is so well written that my boys (ages 9 and 12) were able to make the brownies completely on their own.  They turned out delicious and has been added to our 'make on a regular basis' list.  Thank you!

Not bad,  prpbably won't make again.  I agree with others too cake like of a texture.  I would suggest either using two browine mixes or make in a 9x9 pan.  Family liked but still some left after a week.

These were really good with the fudge topping I added.   I also added a little more peanut butter (2T) and left out the peanuts.  I wished I'd used an 8x8 pan instead of the 9x13 because they were on the thin side.  (For chocolate fudge: 6T butter/shortening to 1 cup chocolate chips in micro, stir, pour over brownies and chill until set).. The kids loved them!..

I was working out of my boyfriend's pantry, so I had to substitute light brown sugar for the white sugar.  I used neufchatel (reduced fat cream cheese), and was very generous with the extra crunchy peanut butter, since I didn't have chopped nuts to add.  These are delicious, and I'll definitely make them again sometime, but I think I will use creamy peanut butter and not add the extra nuts, for a smoother texture.

These were delicious! Since I am a peanut butter lover, I think next time I will make a bit more of the peanut butter mixture to mix into the batter.
I omitted the peanuts.

Very, very good. It was my goal to make these dairy-free for a colleague. I used 1/2 c. peanut butter in the swirl and left out the cream cheese. Only four stars because it could use more peanut butter, but it's excellent and versatile. Add chocolate or pb chips, or reese's pieces....or m and m's or......

This were super easy and everyone loved them.  I used a full cup of peanut butter and 5oz. of cream cheese like some other people suggested.  I also omitted the nuts but used crunchy peanut butter which I think made all the difference.  My landlord who is an amaxing cook asked me to show her how to make these, so I will take that as a very positive review!

Wow!  These are really good!  They're very moist but mine are not greasy.  I kept the recipe the same except I added a bit more peanut butter (only because we love PB).

I used the plainest, least expensive brownie mix and the brownies were still great. Also, used crunchy peanut butter (plus the additional chopped peanuts). My batch only made 24 brownies, not 36. I guess I just like them bigger!

This recipe is very moist and delicious.  I enjoyed that this recipe was very fast and easy to make. These brownies didn't stick around long, in fact I had to made another batch the next day.  You may just want to make two batches while you at it because your family and friends will eat them all up for sure!

Good, but nothing to write home about. Couldn't even taste the PB and I added more than suggested. Not complaining at all because everyone loved them just because they were brownies. Thanks!
