This is a good company dish. I prefer not cooking the zucchini before adding the other ingredients as the zucchini got too mushy.

A friend gave me 2 big zucchinis and 2 big yellow summer squashes.  I made this recipe with each squash.  It is equally good with either kind.  Unexpected company came the first day we tried this, and they raved about it.

I did substitute egg beaters for eggs,Nayonaise (soy base) for mayonaise, & 4 oz of (soy base)mozzarella cheese for the romano.  I also feel that you can get 12 servings from this recipe.  Using the carb count the way I made it is about 13 grams.  I also would like to add some Italian seasoning the next time I make this.  Overall this was a wonderful way to enjoy my fresh zucchini from the garden.  Thanks to Mary for this recipe.

I was very happy with it, but did make a couple of changes....used a cheddar/jack mix of cheese instead of the romano and when it came out of the oven, grated romano over the top.......also, did NOT cook the zucchini first.

Wow, this is great!! Very tasty and a super way to use up the zucchini. Even better warmed up the next day!! One note, I wouldn't use 6 LARGE zucchini, that would be far to much. I think the recipe should read: 6 small zucchini. You could even serve it as a breakfast/brunch dish. Don't skimp on the onions, they are a key ingredient. Will DEFINITELY make this again and again. Thanks for sharing!!

This dish makes for a tasty brunch and is a great way to use up those extra garden zucchinis. I substituted shredded mozzarella cheese for the romano, added extra black pepper & a few dashes of salt, and used corn flakes instead of crackers for the topping. Instead of using pats of butter, I melted about 1/4 cup of butter and drizzled it over the top for more even distribution. We thoroughly enjoyed this dish hot, cold, and reheated the next day!

I loved the flavor of this dish.  It is great right out of the oven, but gets mushy and is not good for leftovers.

I made this scaled down for 3-4 people. I only had two zucchini's and didn't know what to do with them. I did not pre-cook them and they came out tender and not mushy. I used italian seasoned bread crumbs for a topping because it was what I had on hand. After I baked at 425 for 20 min I added 1/2 cup of mozzerella on top because I love cheese! I think it came out perfect and a great change from my plain old steamed zucchini.

Great vegetable casserole!  I served it for dinner guests.  One guest asked what it was.  When I told him it was zucchini he said he didn't like zucchini but would try it.  He had 3 huge helpings and asked for the recipe!  Lots of flavor.  I couldn't find just romano chesse so substituted with Shredded Parmesan,Romano and Asaiago cheese off the dry good shelf at the grocery store.   This replaces my greenbean casserole!

My husband and I had guests over and I honestly had not planned a meal yet.  So, I got on this website and searched for my favorite thing in life, zucchini and attempted this recipe.  My guests were so amazed that I whipped it up right in front of them and then a 1/2 hour later, they were throwin' it down.  I substituted extra sharp cheese for the romano and used towns buttered crackers.  My guests raved and raved about it, went home and made it for themselves.  What a wonderful dish!!  I'll be making this one a lot!

Very nice. I didn't have regular eggs so I used 1/2C egg beaters and only had low fat mayo. Still came out VERY nice. Next time I'll add more onions though :)

Not a fan,  I'm wondering if I made with Cheddar cheese if it would be better.  The  leftovers are going into compost.

Very tasty! I used one large zucchini for a 4-serving meal, and it was plenty. I also used light mayo. Great recipe for a CSA! Thanks. :)

I had a bunch of zucchinis on hand and needed to get dinner done in a hurry; thought this recipe looked great in a pinch, but made some big changes to drop the fat content and speed up the prep.  I grated the squashes using a food processor and skipped the parboiling entirely (zucchini still comes out of the oven nice and tender.)  I was out of mayo, but had garlic aioli on hand which worked just fine.  I also skipped the butter and crackers on top, and added a finely diced serrano pepper into the mix to give it some zip.  Came out beautiful!

This was a big hit with my family! Even my hubby who usually doesn't eat squash.
The only substitution I made was I used sharp cheddar cheese.
Wouldn't you know THIS year the zuchinni in our garden has not been as abundant as years past? :)
Thanks Mary!!!

This is by far the best zucchini out there.  I have been making this casserole for the last couple of years and whatever the occasion, people always ask for the recipe.  The only change I make is adding more Ritz crackers for the topping.  I usually use 2 bags of Ritz.  After all the topping is the best part.  Enjoy!

This was so unbelievably good.  My kids were disappointed when they realized I only made 1 1/2 times the recipe for our crew.  They want me to make it again right away!  Admittedly, I couldn't resist adding garlic and basil.   I served it with Chunky Marinara Sauce from AR.  It was really delicious.  We'll add this to our regular rotation on meatless meals on Friday nights.

My family really liked this casserole.  I will definately try this recipe again.  I only used 3 medium zucchini instead of the recommended 6.  I also added salt and used cheddar cheese because that is what I had available.  I did not precook the squash.  I agree with others that it would have had enough texture with the precook.

This casserole is delicious! It would be perfect to bring to a potluck dinner--guaranteed to disappear! I also added a can of white beans for extra flavor and protein. I think I would saute the onions first to soften them.

This casserole was very tasty and extremely simple to make.  I did not dot the top with butter and I used light mayo and parmesan cheese to cut down on the fat and it tasted wonderful.  I also thought that it was going to turn out a little soupy, so I added about one cup of fresh bread crumbs.  Thank you for the great way to use up my zucchini harvest!

I made this as a side for Thanksgiving and took it to two dinners.  It was very popular with my family and my boyfriend who doesn't care for eggs.  It didn't find it eggy at all.  I've started making this dish with light mayo and an egg substitute like "Egg Beaters" with great results!

I made this last night and loved it!  My husband does not like zucchini and he loved it as well!! The only step that I left out was boiling the zucchini before hand - it came out perfect! 

Thank you for submitting this recipe!

Excellent recipe. I served it as a main course but it's a wonderful side dish. I, too, did not cook zucchini first and the consistency was perfect after about 40 minutes cooking time. I used garlic/herb bread crumbs for topping.

Easy. Very good. Used light mayo.  I did the recipe for 4 servings and it would have been enough for 6. Good for side dish or appetizer.

This was good, but next time I'll cut the zucchini into 1" or 2" cubes.  My pieces were too big so it took longer to cook and the sauce did not cling to the squash as well.

Loved this. I had to use grated parm cheese and topped with crushed saltines, because thats what I had in the house. I added a small amount of shredded cheese and used 2 large fresh zucc's out of garden. Delicious!!

This turned out to be greasy even though I used less mayonnaise and butter than called for. Needs some other dry ingredient.

I really enjoyed this! Made only a few changes and that was the type of cheese because I had no romano, so I used a cheddar, I used only 4 zucchini, because 6 seemed way too much, as well, I used bread crumbs on top instead of crushed crackers and I did not cook the zucchini beforehand as another reviewer suggested, and the zucchini cooked just fine. Still turned out well. Will be making this again! :)

This was surprisingly good! I added baby squash along with baby zucchini slices. Also I used saltine crackers, since I was out of "buttery rounds". I added mozzarella on top, as well, and YUMMMM! Oh also added some season all.

We raise our own zucchini every year. I made this, only doubled the recipe and it was gone in no time. My family loves this and is another way for me to get them to eat their veggies LOL. I recommend this recipe even for those that wouldn't normally like zucchini. Delicious!

This is a very tasty dish, but I did make a lot changes.  I try to doctor up zucchini as much as possible b/c I really don't like it, but try to eat it because I know it's good for us.  I shredded the zucchini, added colby jack cheese along w/ some parmesan, added some garlic and fresh basil and topped with panko breadcrumbs.  Oh I also used Miracle Whip rather than mayo which I won't do next time b/c it gave it a sort of sweet flavor that was a turn off.  I may mix sour cream and mayo next time.  ETA:  I made this again and forgot to add the egg and it still turned out great.  I also used the half sour cream and half mayo and it was really good.

It's amazing to me that such a simple recipe using a "bland" vegetable could be sooo tasty! This is delicious! I used 1 lage zucchini, cut in 1/2 & then sliced. I followed the recipe exactly & can't imagine any need for improvement. YUM!

Just made this for my first time for a xmas dinner for 20 and everyone kept talking about it.   I didn't even get to try it first so I just had faith...    I used half zucchini and half yellow squash - definitely no need to boil or pre-cook the veggies at all -- that would turn them to total mush.    It is rich and salty because of the type of cheese used -- don't skimp on the squash.  My pan was filled about half way, but next time I'll fill it to the top with veggies and it will be less rich.   But seriously so great tasting I could have eaten 4-5 servings and it's probably even better the next day.    This is almost the exact same recipe as the sensational and very popular artichoke heart dip.   Just combine mayo, Romano cheese, and chopped artichoke hearts, sprinkle top with bread crumbs or crackers and bake.   People will literally not leave this dip at a party.

I lightened up the recipe a bit - I sauteed the sliced zucchini and onion (and some fresh garlic) in some olive oil. I used fat free saltines instead of the butter round crackers and used farmer cheese instead of the mayo. I also added some fresh basil which gave it delicious flavor! I mixed it all together and put it into a dish and baked for about 25 minuets. It was so nice and delicious! Iserved it with "Byrdhouse Mushroom Barley Pilaf" from this site!

I combined this with summer squash; added minced onion & cheddar cheese.  I didn't have buttery crackers, so used boxed "sesame" type onces which I liked a lot.
I'm a big spice freak so I threw in chopped, fresh thyme, hot sauce, and fresh parsley...
Everyone liked it, and it tasted better the next day reheated in the micro.

I used a 2lb bag of frozen Broccoli Normandy vegetable mix. Cooked according to package directions.  Doubled the ingredients (excluding zucchini). Everyone thought it was great. Will definitely make again using any type of veggie.

Loved it. Did a few modifications. I did not precook the Zucchini nor did I use crackers on top. I did however add garlic and used cheddar/jack cheese with Parmesan  sprinkled on top. AWESOME!! We ate the whole casserole

Good recipe!  It was nice to try a different recipe for zucchini.  Our family enjoyed it! The egg texture was very light tasting.

This was fine. Easy to make. I made as-described and felt it was little flat. Salt would help, but it was still fairly dull. I might make again for just me and my husband, but not for company.

I have been trying different squash casseroles this summer, and this one is the best so far! I used zucchini, yellow squash, and eggplant, and also threw in some peppers and onions. I used cheddar cheese instead of Romano and didn't boil the squash first. (I cooked it a little longer in the oven.) It turned out deliciously delicious!

I was absolutely amazed that this tasted as good as it did.  I followed the recipe, except for the crackers.  We are a gluten free house, so I substituted crushed rice chex for the topper.  I really expected my three guys to hate it.  They tend towards simpler, non-veggie meals.  But this was a huge hit. They even asked me to make this again.

The only reason for the 4 star rating is because I used this recipe as a starting point, then did my own thing to make it suitable to our taste.   I sauted zucchini, yellow squash, onions, and mushrooms, then mixed all the veggies with seasoned croutons and diced fresh tomatoes.   I decreased the grated parmesan to 2 Tbsp. and added a handfull of shredded mozzerella to the mayo and egg mixture.   It was yummy, yummy, yummy!!   I would never have thought to use mayo and egg as a sauce - but it was really wonderful in the casserole.   I'll be making this again...  I may try adding green onions next time.

This was the first meal I made for my partner and I was so excited to have a romantic dinner at home. After taking one bit I called for pizza. My partner, being kind, ate a few more bites, but was happy when the pizza arrived. Will not be making this again.

Loved the taste.  Had only a few zucchinis ready from the garden.  Did not have Romano cheese on hand, so I cut small squares of sharp cheese to substitute.  Was terrific.!!

Added some garlic and green pepper. Topped with crushed pork rind instead of crackers and thin slices of cheddar. We loved it.

Loved this recipe. Doubled the crackers, didn’t cook the squash before, and added an egg. Loved it.

very bland.  definitely needs more spices.  also always use cheddar cheese with zucchini, not romano.  doesnt go well together.  i also only like grated zucchini, not sliced which i did instead and also didnt have to pre boil them.

Really enjoyed this dish. Seemed to taste better as leftovers too. Easy to make. May use a little less mayo next time, maybe 3/4 instead of a cup. Very tasty!

I used buttered breadcrumbs and stretched the mayo with some light cream. I did not pre-cook the zucchinis. I cooked it for an hour in a 350-degree oven. We really liked it!!!

This recipe is delicious but I changed it - not because it needed it but because I did not have all the stuff. Instead of the buttered cracker topping, I used Ramen noodles plus some bacon bits. I also used the tip to not boil the zucchini ahead but sliced it directly in the casserole dish with the onion, egg/mayo mixture. Mozzarella cheese was also substituted because I had no Romano cheese. It was very good.

I made this for our Sunday night dinner without changing any ingredients (except I went by other reviews & only used 3 zucchini)..  it is delicious! I didn't boil the zucchini before baking because we don't like mushy food. Next time I'm going to add some garlic & a bit of Frank's Red Hot to kick up the flavor a bit. It's a great side for someone on a low carb diet.Hubby loved it!!
