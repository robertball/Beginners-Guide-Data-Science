I made this and it got some good compliments, but I think next time I would use a larger plan than 9"square, because the cornbread was very thick (tall) in the 9" pan.  Also, the buttermilk flavor/smell (sour) was a little strong for me...maybe I would cut it with some regular milk or cream.

OMG!!!  I just baked this cranberry cornbread and everyone gobbled it up.  It is sweet, moist, and the cranberries add a just the right "Zing" to it.  I'll make this for our Christmas party and put it in "My Favorites" in my recipe book.
If you don't have buttermilk on hand, substitute with 1 1/2 tablespoons of lemon juice or vinegar then fill to the 1 1/2 cup line on the measuring cup with milk.  Let Mixture stand for 5 minutes before adding to the recipe.

I loved this cornbread! I used brown sugar instead of white and I baked it in a cast iron skillet which I think makes the best corn bread. I will definitely be making it again.

I am not a big cook but I made this for Thanksgiving and it was awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly excpet that I pulled out half of the batter before adding the cranberries so that I would have some plain cornbread too.  I made them out of small cornshaped pans.  It was fabulous with or without the cranberries.  Also for halving the cranberries I used scissors, I am not sure if everyone knew to do that except for me, but it was easy with scissors, not so easy with a knife.

I made 12 standard muffins (bake @ 400F for 22 mins) and 9 mini muffins (bake @ 400F for 20 mins) out of this recipe.  I added 1/4 cup ground flaxseed to dry ingredients, and used 1 cup all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour instead of 1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour.  Perfect!!

As far as corn bread recipes go...this one is great because you can make it with or without the cranberries.  The texture isn't as dry and crumbly as some corn bread recipes and it has a touch of sweetness.

Made exactly as written, adding a handful of Craisins.  Made about 20 mini-muffins, baked for 20 minutes was just right. Next time I'd use half buttermilk/half sweet milk though.

Oh...my... YUM! Sweet corn bread and tangy-tart cranberries: what a great pairing. The only problem is we ate twice as much as we normally would:once with dinner and then afterwards, as a dessert! :) This is going in the FAVORITES file. Thank you, for sharing this one, Sylvia Gidwani.

Delicious ... made the muffins because they are easier to freeze and/or transport for work, snacks, etc. Actually tastes better-- and are less crumbly-- the second day.

One of my family's favorite recipes.  I add extra cranberries because we don't like it so sweet, and we usually have it for breakfast.  A good substitute for the buttermilk is half milk/half low-fat yogurt mixed together.  I use this in place of buttermilk most of the time and it has always worked great in all of my recipes.

This cornbread recipe is one of the best I have ever tasted. It was so I had two giant slices instead of one. It baked perfectly and was so soft (not dry). I will make this again and again.

This is a great cornbread with the perfect combo of sweet and sour. I make it every holiday. However, I have to double it just to feed six people.

LOVED this!!  I had an 11x7 pan so had to do it in that and it turned out great.  I love the sweet buttery cornbread with the tart cranberries - and such a fun holiday twist!!

I made this to accompany our New Years dinner.  I used milk instead of buttermilk and it still turned out great.  I used Truvia instead of regular sugar which prevented the cranberries from being as sweet as they could have been.  Add a little butter and you've got a new favorite.

Moist and tender and delicious as written, with delightful sweet/tart contrasting flavors. It was still a trace heavy and sweet for my taste--perfection when I cut 1/4c sugar and whipped the beegeebers out of the butter and sugar (white and light) the next time around. Texture is still delightful without the cranberries and substituting lemon juice/whole milk for buttermilk does just as well, too. All around divine corn bread. My keeper.

Just made a couple of changes to this recipe since I didn't have all the right ingredients. Used Craisins and sour milk (milk & vinegar). Baked in a 11x7 inch pan. The craisins sank to the bottom. I thought it was better without the craisins yet my husband loved it and said that it makes the corn bread. I ended up eating the top part of it and he eats the bottom so hence the 5 stars.

I realized that I don't have any flour after I mixed in almost everything. So instead of flour, I replaced it with a cup of cornmeal and 1/2 cup of oats. It was a little too liquidy so I put in 2 tbs of pancake mix I found. I also didn't have buttermilk so I used a cup of milk with 1tbs of lime juice. I also used 2 cups of fresh cranberry. It turned out perfect, moist and yummy!

This came out very well. It is a nice mix between corn bread and a regular quick bread. I followed a suggestion to place in a 9x13 pan, and it came out a little thin for my liking. I would stick with a 9x9 inch pan for your first batch. I think this recipe is well suited to replace some of the flour with additional corn meal if you want more of a cornbread texture. It was a hit at my company pot luck.

I made this recipe exactly as written with the exception of baking it in an 8x8 glass pan.  The recipe turned out thick, moist, evenly colored and attractive cornbread. There is a good blend of flavors in this recipe and they all came singing through nicely.  I really noticed the buttermilk, which I rather enjoyed, but if you like a more subtle buttermilk flavor, you may want to consider the yogurt/milk substitute other reviewers have used.  If you generally like fresh cranberries, there is enough in the recipe to be satisfied, but I will add more in the future because I LOVE them so much.

This recipe is great, the results were fantastic as is.  The next batch I replaced the white sugar with 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup raw honey.  Yep, it was sticky and yep it was sweet and the kids (young and old) actually ate it as their dessert.  Thank you so much for your recipe.

This is an awesome recipe!!  Everyone loved it.  Put whipped honey on top for an extra treat.  With a double batch I used 1 cup brown sugar & 1 cup white sugar.  I also used 1 cup wheat flour and 2 cups white flower.  I cooked it in a large cake pan and also put some in a large muffin pan greased with butter.  I think the muffins were slightly better, but that could have been because I didn't cook the cake pan long enough.(?)

This was just delicious!  Oddly, somehow all my cranberries floated to the top during baking so I was somewhat disappointed at first not to see cranberries dotted throughout the cornbread.  It still looked good, and the cornbread was out of this world delicious!  It's actually a bit cake-like to me, with a much finer crumb and texture than I was expecting, and is not only good as a side (we had with roasted chicken and root vegetables) but is good enough for dessert, snack or even breakfast!  Love this recipe, and I will definitely make this again...soon!

Absolutely perfect!  I'm not usually big on cornbread, but the texture plus the extra kick of fresh cranberries really made it a hit!  I made a practice batch, then doubled the recipe and cooked in a 9x13 cake pan till toothpick came out clean, and it came out great with enough for everyone!!!!

It was good with butter, the cranberries were super tart which I wasn't crazy about. I love cornbread, and I think I will stick with the old fashion kind.

These are fantastic and super easy! I definitely recommend using the buttermilk (I used the low fat kind). Also, I highly recommend baking them in a muffin pan to avoid the tall, cakey cornbread effect. I used the mini muffin pan, reduced the cooking time by 5-10 minutes, and these came out in perfect bite-sized proportions. They were easy to transport and can heat up well wrapped in aluminum foil in the oven. Perfect to compliment the Thanksgiving meal!

This is my new favorite cornbread/cake!  I didn't care for the cranberry part.  I'll just omit them next time.  Personal preference and nothing wrong with the recipe.  I made this as a trial run in preperation for baking during the Holidays and Husband I nearly ate the whole thing in one sitting.  YUMMM!

TERRIFIC!!  I used the recipe pretty much as is, but overfilled the cup of cranberries a bit and made them in 4 mini loaf pans so I can give them as gifts.  Definitely more a dessert than a bread side dish, but very, very good!!

This is a light, tender, sweet corn cake. I didn't bother to halve my cranberries and it was fine. I was pleased with the texture; I really expected something unpleasant to happen because I'm positive the directions instruct you to overbeat the batter, but it actually works out light and delicious. I also wasn't sure what to expect with using baking powder instead of soda with buttermilk, but they rose just a little bit yet the texture was not negatively affected. I'm not sure I'll make this particular recipe again (too much like dessert for us!) but I'd recommend this to anyone who likes a cornbread that is like a cake (with or without the cranberries). Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic! Even folks who don't like cornbread beg for seconds. I've also made it with half cranberries, half sweet blackberries with good results too.

Delicious cornbread recipe! The cranberries added just the right amount of sweetness without overpowering the corn bread taste. I used the whole bag of Craisins dried cranberries, which was a little more than called for (about 1 and 1/3 cup), but I think it was the perfect amount. The corn bread alone has a fantastic taste, and it will likely become my staple cornbread recipe, with or without the cranberries.

So good!  I baked this in a cast-iron skillet, as someone suggested in the reviews.  The texture is perfect, not too dry.  The cranberries balance the sweetness of the batter.  I'll make this again.

This was a disappointment since I love cranberries.  the cornbread was bland and the cranberries made a tasteless cornbread more sour.  Perhaps it would be better if the sugar amount was increased thereby making the opposing sweet and sour flavors more distinct.  I will not make this again.

This was a very quick and very successful recipe! I shared it on a cold late November garden workday, and it was a hit with my fellow community garden members. I had been looking for a simple and hearty corn recipe. I substitutted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour, it was great, the cranberries give it the kick towards something unique. Definitely a keeper! I want to try it next with bluberries, it's sure a healthy snack option. thanks!

Excellent recipe!  Very moist cornbread.  It was sweeter than most, almost like a dessert.  My son was happy to see a "dessert" item for the main course!  I used scissors to half the cranberries.  I didn't have a 9x9 pan so I used an 8x8 and just baked it a little longer.  I'll make this again!

I made these in an 8-section divided wedge (scone) pan, 370 degrees for 30 minutes; leftover batter fills 4 sections 2nd batch.  I like these! Tasty, hold together well, cranberries are a nice twist. I'm confident they'll be a hit tomorrow at the Thanksgiving feast.

This corn bread is buttery and delicious.  I found it took a lot longer that the stated time to bake (about 1 hour).  I also didn't halve the cranberries.

This is delicious! I used white cornmeal since I didn't have yellow--and the cornbread was very pretty. I also used sugar-in-the-raw, but I'm not sure what difference that would make. I will make this every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas too!
