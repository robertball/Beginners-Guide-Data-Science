This is SOOO good!  I used canned spinach, but frozen would be even better!  I've used many recipes from allrecipes.com, but this recipe made me register, just to write a review!  Thanks for sharing, and thanks to mom Alice, too!

Anything that makes my kid eat spinach is worth 10 stars so I wish I could give it more!  I loved it too.  Soooooo good.  If you try it you won't be disappointed!

Really good recipe. I guess I'm under the understanding that spoon bread is just as it means. Spooning it out. I would have done so but the middle was still very liquidy and to my family's preference, not appetizing, so I kept batch in the oven for about 10 minutes longer, so that I could cut out and plate with dinner verse it looking a little sloppy. Having said that. We liked the recipe very much in the extended baking time. Even my son took a bite and said it was ok, for he's not a spinach lover but did say he couldn't taste the spinach at all. But I really liked it. It wasn't over fabulous, just really good. TY

OK, if you don't like spinach, you have GOT to try this!  My picky son ate it up tonight and said it tasted like "dessert"!  It is so moist, even though I used just about a teaspoon of margarine, instead of the amount called for.  I also used three egg whites instead of whole eggs, and light sour cream.  WONDERFUL!

I have never made spoon bread before and didn't know what to expect.  It is a really sweet, moist cross between a casserole and bread.  We had it with ribs and corn on the cob and loved it.

I made this for my Easter dinner and everyone loved it. I had only compliments. I did leave it in the oven a little longer til the top was completely firm. I made no other changes. I will make it again, this is a keeper.

HUGE hit with my family!  Being the only person in my family who eats vegetables, I am regularly looking for sneaky ways to add more in there...  This was, yet another smash hit!  It has already been requested as a regular dish!

I  used frozen spinach. I added chopped red bell pepper and chopped green onion sautéed in a little butter to the mixture. It was beautiful to behold and delicious to taste. I submitted a photo (Mizzglow).

This stuff is the bomb.  I didn't have the Packaged corn muffin mix so I used 8 oz. of regular corn bread mix.  The only other change I made was I had a little chopped onion left from another recipe and I just threw it in for good measure.  I did let it cook till the entire thing was set ( it took about 45 mins)But well worth the wait.  I'll be making this again and very soon.

Superbowl Sunday.  I'd been looking for recipes that I could use the pulp left over when I make green juice.  This has potential.  Here we go.  I made the recipe, substituting my green juice pulp for the spinach.  My pulp was mostly green with some carrot visable too.    I ate this for breakfast with some waldorf salad and a few strips of bacon.  I can’t say the the Veggie Spoon Bread really knocked my socks off, but it was good, and went well with the other items.  Also, I took a cue from Ms7up and baked longer than directed the bread would set.  It is likely that I will make this again.

I made this recipe using butter instead of margarine and substituted a buttermilk corn muffin mix for a sweet one. It was absolutely DELICIOUS!!

This really wasn't anything that special. I'd prefer plain cornbread to this, and I do like spinach.

I wasn't paying close attention and originally poured in a whole can of cream corn (14 oz size) so be mindful of that smaller can size. But I was able to scoop out enough from the bowl to recover and be back on track. I found that I had to cook it a bit longer but was delicious!! I could sit and eat the whole pan myself. Even picky daughter liked it fairly well.

So good. I added a little onion powder and finely diced red pepper which I highly recommend.  This takes longer in the oven than called for- 50 minutes total.
