I don't generally like sweet drinks, but this was very good, and I would definitely make it again.  It's very easy and would be great for entertaining!

This does remind me of a coke float! At least the second one did. My hubby mixed up the first & he used Bacardi Gold which gave it more of a rum taste than I was looking for. I used a Bacardi white for the second & it was sooo good. I am out of coffee liquer so I used Godiva's cappucino liquer & it worked very well. Will have again & again.

This drink is absolutely AWESOME!  There are no words to explain it--you must try it yourself.

This is just incredible.  I was skeptical at the ingredients at first, but the reviews swayed me.  It really is delicious, not overly sweet like some cola based drinks can be,  a little creamy but refreshing without being overly rich.  A complex flavor, very unique.  I love whipping up new cocktails, and this one is DEFINITELY going in my regular rotation, thanks!!

The rum and coffee liqueur combo was pretty tasty.  I used diet cola and perhaps that accounted for the inability of my sweetened condensed milk to mix it.

I think I'll try this one again.

This was wonderful.  Very smooth, with no overbearing flavors.

Different & tasty. Made for a small party & was a hit...tasted similar to a root beer float. Everyone was ready for more! Thanks for a good simple use of coffee liqueur.

Oh yeah, this will get made again and again in this house. And I even made it with Coke Zero.
