This is definetly NOT Ethiopian chicken.  Being of Ethiopian descent I was wandering how the ingredients were going to come out having an Ethiopian flavor... well it didn't.  So if you're looking for Ethiopian this isn't it.  The soy sauce should have been a dead give-away.  As for the taste of the dish itself, I thought it bland as well.

The only reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because the recipe does not direct you to marinate the chicken overnight or all day.  I let it marinate for 5 hours and that was not enough.  Also, be sure to keep the onions- don't throw them away after you have drained the water off! Marinate them with the chicken, bake them, and serve them.  Each time I have made this dish, my guests have gone nuts for the onion pieces, which somehow do an amazing job of carrying the various flavors of clove, cinnamon, and ginger.  The onions are so popular that I now use them to compliment other dishes, such as smoked fish, baked sweet potatoes, and roast turkey.

I was expecting "Ethiopian" flavors from the title.  Having grown up in Ethiopia, I can assuredly say that this isn't Ethiopian... it's more like some kind of Asian combination from the seasonings.

Two variants -- One time I ran short on soy sauce and went with 1/3 cup soy sauce and 1/3 cup white wine; family loved it--we call it Drunken Ethiopian Chicken.  Also have used it on boneless thighs, just saute the thighs with the onions and then pour the sauce over and reduce, worked great!

My 9 year old son, 90 year old father-in-law and I LOVED these. You could actually taste the cinnamon and ginger. I had left out the onion because my son doesn't like them, but I used 1/2 teaspoon onion powder. Fabulous for any age.

Easy, so economical, can be prepared in
large volumn to be frozen and simply reheated when any occasion calls for it.
Another recipe dieters can say 'thank you' for.

I cooked this for picky southern parents, an Egyptian husband and a beyond picky toddler. It has been a great hit. The only difference I made was to cook the chicken in a dutch over. It came out so moist and flavorful. It may not be Ethiopian (Ethiopian food is the best) but it is still good.

I loved these and so did my kids.  My hubby, however, thought they were just okay - too strong.  Next time I make them I will probably add a little cayenne pepper for kick.

These wings were absolutely SUPER! I followed the recipe exactly, and they came out moist and delicious. A really nice change from your everyday hot wings, and the leftovers were even better the next day. Thanks for a perfect recipe!

I wish I could give this three and a half stars for accuracy! Both I and my sister liked it, but hubby wasn't crazy about it. Everyone agrees it could be improved by adding a little brown sugar to the soy sauce mixture, so I'll be trying this again but making the sauce into more of a glaze next time. Still, tasty and well paired with the Ethiopian Cabbage Dish on this site.

Very tasty dish!

I only had boneless skinless breasts on hand, but will definitely go with the wings next time. I highly recommend keeping the onions in the dish, they were sweet and delicious.

Make it vegetarian!!!!!  I used Quorn naked chicken cutlets and just skipped the boiling part.  Everything else stayed the same.  It was VERY delicious.  Pair it with the Ethiopian cabbage/carrot/potato dish and it is an amazing dinner.

This was great! I used 2 chicken breast cut into bite sized pieces and poured the sauce over the chicken and baked it.  Also, I didn't use cloves because I didn't have any. Yummy!

This is a great recipe. I cut boneless chicken breasts into small strips instead. It was still good, but not crispy (like it would be if you used chicken wings).

I really did like this!  The only reason I gave it a 3/5 is because of the salt. It is so salty that the beautiful flavor was a bit obscured. But really do like it.

Made this 2 days ago and it was okay. It was a change from my norm. I did not like the texture of the skin on the wings (not crispy). I like my chicken wings a little crisp so the next day i heated the left-over wings under the broiler for about 5-7 minutes on each side.
Next time i will do that on the 1st go around as well as what someone said in another review...Use brown sugar mixed with soy sauce for more of a glaze.

!! Amazing flavor. My apartment smelled fantastic all day. The boyfriend couldn't believe it. Regardless of any debate over whether or not the flavors are truly Ethiopian, this is very much worth making!

Awesome!  Although I'm confused as to how soy sauce made its way to Ethiopia, given the sauce was never widespread nor well-known outside the orient until the late 20th century - thus it would not have been a traditionally available condiment there.  Anyhow, delicious.  I made this with chicken legs.  Next time I might try marinating chicken breasts overnight in this and then baking - to reduce the fat.  The bonus on this dish is the homemade chicken stock!  Thanks Heidi B!
