Great side dish that's simple to make.  I sauteed the mushrooms in two cloves of minced garlic and a splash of white wine.  I also used a mix of parmesan and romano cheeses in place of the feta.  I topped it with a little more cheese before serving.  I used this as a side dish for Bessy's Zesty Grilled Garlic-Herb Chicken from this site and it was delicious.  I will definitely make this again.  You can even add leftover chicken to make this into a main dish vs. side dish.

I actually found this recipe several years ago in a magazine (same submitter) and we have loved it since then!  My best friend was visiting from back East and now it is one of her favorite recipes! I usually make mild turkey sausage cooked with basil as a meat to go with this dish since my husband usually wants more.  Really a great dish!

I omitted salt, doubled basil and increased cheese a little. Good. Next time I may add garlic and red pepper, too.

Great recipe. I also added garlic to the original recipe. Super fast and easy to make... not overpowered by having too many ingredients!

Very good!  I too added garlic and a pinch of red pepper flakes.  Enjoyed with our shrimp skewers.

I really liked this recipe. It's fast and easy. Like the reviewer before me, I added garlic (2 tsp. minced from a jar during the last minute of mushroom sautee). I would make it again.

I love the name of this dish - hilarious :) Anyway, it was really easy to throw together, though next time I might try adding more spices (I only added some garlic this time). I just ate two portions as an entree!
