Recipe Group: My son and I enjoyed this recipe. I find it to be rather like caramel, consistency-wise. The crust didn't do much for me, however....like sand that crumbled all over the bottom of the pan. The filling was like cookie dough, so I actually kind of rolled/squished it into the shape of my pan and laid it over the crust. I did use my convection oven, set 25 degrees lower than recipe stated, per manufacturers instructions. Times given in recipe were spot on. Yes the bars are ridiculously sweet....I cut them pretty small to compensate. I did cut the recipe in half and used my square pan, no issues there. I have never had peanut butter pie so can't compare there...but this was a great snack/dessert, thanks for sharing!

This recipe did not work out well for me at all.  I made half a batch and baked in a nine inch pie pan.  The consistency is way off IMHO.  I could not even cut this into bars, as it would just crumble apart. Additionally,for us, this was way too sweet. I triple checked my quantities and ingredients to make sure I didn't make a mistake and I'm pretty sure I made it according to the recipe.  We tried eating it anyway, but ...sorry...

This was the Buzz Group Recipe Selection for 9/13/14. If you are looking for a sugar overload, look no further as this will be the recipe for you. The directions say to spread the peanut butter mixture over the graham cracker crust.  I had to crumble the mixture over the crust. I only made 1/2 of the recipe and baked in an 8" x 8" foil lined square pan for 14 minutes.  I allowed the bars to cool completely, lifted them out of the pan and cut into squares.  While we liked these, I doubt that I will make them again - just too much of a good thing!  Thanks for sharing your recipe, S. Eyres.

Recipe Group: After reading Mi Being Mi's and Shearone's reviews, I cut the powdered sugar in half [3/4 c] - next time, I may leave it out, altogether, using just the brown sugar and honey. I also used a rounded cup of peanut butter - maybe 1 1/4 cups, altogether [creamy, because it's what I have on hand]. I intended to use only peanut butter chips on one half, for my chocolate-hating manchild - but had accidently picked up a mixed bag of milk chocolate and peanut butter chips - which worked out fine. I used about 1/2 cups of the chips. I lined my pan with nonstick foil, which I used to lift the bars out of my pan, placing them on a cutting board to cut into squares. I liked it with the crust - BUT, the crust just fell off when I picked them up. It seemed somewhat better, after I refrigerated them. I might make them again, without the crust. It would be almost like a peanut butter fudge (=
