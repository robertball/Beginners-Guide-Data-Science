All of these similar cake mix cookies are pretty good.
But the cake mixes have shrunk to more like 15 oz. This means you need to reduce the oil a bit.  Or I've used 2 boxes of mix with 3 extra large eggs and 3/4 to 4/5 c oil. Would be great to update the recipes. 

I usually add  1/2 to 1 tsp vanilla. For spice cake batter, a dash more pumpkin spice (or at least cinnamon).  For chocolate cake mix, I add a Tbsp or so of cocoa to make it a bit richer and cut sweet/sweet taste.

I forgot I needed to bring a dessert to a Christmas party! I had a spice cake mix and this sounded easy ... but I also didn't have any raisins.  I chopped up some dried mangos instead.  It turned out great.  The nut and fruit combination was perfect for Christmas.  Thank You!!

I make these with some kind of chopped nut (macadamia or almond slivers) and white chocolate chips... It's our all time favorite.  And couldn't be easier.  Going to make and bring to Paint & Pastries night tonight. :)

Took the advice of other poster and cut back on the oil.  I  hadn't thought to check the size  of  the cake mix. Like so many products the sizes of packages are smaller.    I  also added cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger to spice  it up.

Super easy to make, these cookies turned out with a nice, slightly crispy outside and soft inside.  I'll definitely make these again!

I love cake mix cookies...they're so versatile.  My favorite is carrot cake with raisins or craisins and white chocolate chips.  Depending on where they're going, I may add nuts, either macadamia, pecans. or cashews.  I always keep extra boxes of cake mix on hand just for quick cookies.

Easy recipe. A new favorite!  I would eat all of them if I could get away with it!  These remind me of something my grandma would make.  I've made this a few times already and have also baked in a 13x9 to make into bar cookies.

I had a spice cake mix on hand and didn't really want to make a cake out of it so I looked up cookie recipes and there it was. They turned out really well. I never had raisins, so I added coconut instead. I will be making them again.

Just like other cake mix cookies these are prone to get dry after a day or so but excellent with white choc chips, cranberries, walnuts.

Used dried cranberries instead of raisins.. Drizzled cooled cookies with glaze made with powdered sugar, powdered ginger, and orange juice.

This was so quick and easy to make.  It would be great during the winter holidays and without a lot of fuss to make.  

I could not find an 18.25oz box of mix.  I used the biggest one I could find (Duncan Hines, 16.5oz) and took the advice of another reviewer and reduced the amount of oil used.  (I used a 1/2c measuring cup, but left out about 1/4" from the top).  

I only used 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and substituted the raisins for a 1/2 cup white chocolate chips.

When cooked, they don't flatten out, they stay rounded and thick.   

The cookies were light and fluffy.  I would definitely will make them again.
