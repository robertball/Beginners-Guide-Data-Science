There is a first time for everything. I never knew making mayo was this easy. I made a recipe from this site that called for mayo and teriyaki sauce and I didn't have either so I set out to make my own. This was really good. I don't think it tasted quite like store bought BUT I knew exactly what went in it and I like that. I have free range hens so consuming their raw eggs doesn't bother me a bit. I only wish this had a longer shelf life. It would be nice to make a big batch to keep on hand. But it is so easy and works perfectly as written that it won't be a hassle to make as I need it. Thanks for sharing!

I am Keto and make this quite frequently.  Use the LIGHT olive oil.  The regular or robust olive oil leaves an unpleasant after taste.
