oh my!!  this is the exact recipe my grandmother,, 100% polish decent.. taught me,, from my Great-grandmother, who immigrated from Poland!!.  the only diffrence though, is she made her saur kraut by frying it in the butter with caraway seed, and equal parts vinegar  and sugar,  sort of a  sweet saur  kraut.  its been a family tradition, and all time favorite.  thanx so much,, apfel,,, this is the first recipe ive seen using kraut, and was told this was NOT a true Polish recipe. Glad to have my  great grandmother validated.
our tradition calls for the pierogi to be boiled til cooked through, then served warm with bacon crumbles with bread crumbs spread over them. we have never had them with  sour cream, but I had to try and it was delicious!!

Pierogis have been a family tradition since my great grandmother started making them in the mid 1900s! The best way to make the dough is to just use flour and water, no egg. I do use an egg yolk to seal the edges of the pierogi before closing them up.
