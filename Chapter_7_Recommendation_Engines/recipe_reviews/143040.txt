I usually hate when ppeople change recipes and then rate them, but I had to make changes for what I had on hand.  I used brown sugar instead of Splenda and canned pineapple chunks.  Very good served over rice.

I made these tonight and my family enjoyed them. The sauce is simple and delicious. I added a pinch oregano spice to the mix.

This has become one of my favorite recipes. I love it! I've tried making it with chicken, but it just tastes better with meatballs.

Very good recipe - my family enjoyed this dish for a change from our usual. I think we will adjust the sauce next time for our personal tastes but the sauce is good as is - very flavourful and excellent with the meatballs. Thanks!

Just made this recipe...it was REALLY good...I did add red pepper, used 1/4cup of regular sugar canned pineapple and my own recipe for meatballs. The sauce is really good. Served over rice and all my roommates loved it; one roommate thought it was to sweet, but that was the only complaint.

I whipped this up on the spur of the moment. I already had left over rice so that I wanted to use up so that made it quick for me. Loved it. Just the right sweet, and not overpowering soy sauce. It's a keeper.

It was good but plain. I used brown sugar and a can of pineapples and a dash of worcestershire sauce but it still could use more excitement. I bought frozen chicken meatballs which saved time too.

I tried this recipe and it was okay.  The taste was very good, as I love sweet and sour.   I appreciated that it was low in sugar also.   But the texture of the meatballs left something to be desired.  Even though I cooked them in the liquid, the meat was hard and not very enjoyable to eat.  My wife makes wonderful Italian-style meatballs and her trick is to add a cup of plain breadcrumbs to the meat before forming them into balls.   I think this would help the texture and the taste and I plan to try that next time.   So, five stars on the sauce flavor  but only one star on the taste and texture of the meatballs.
