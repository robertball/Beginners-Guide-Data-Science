These were SO good! I had a medium sized eggplant, and I sliced it and used 12 slices (6 stacks of 2) for this recipe, and still had a few slices left over for another use. I kept all of the rest of the ingredients as is, and substituted green onions for the leeks, as that is what I had on hand. I served these over a bed of angel hair pasta tossed in a light marinara sauce. My Italian husband suggested adding a slice of mortadella between the layers next time! Sounds good to me, but they were terrific as is as well! Will make again!
