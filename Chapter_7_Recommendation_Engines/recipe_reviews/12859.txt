My teenage son and husband LOVED this. They don't care for breading so I didn't flour it first, just pan fried it... Also I did not have green onions or lime juice.. so I made it with 4TBSP lemon and 2TBSP orange juice. They felt this was better than restaurant quality.

Delightful...I also bumped up the orange juice and added a TBSP of Teriyaki sauce.  I used fresh basil instead of parsley.  I also doubled the sauce and served it with brown rice and broccoli.  I poured the sauce over the rice and broc and sprinkled with slivered almonds.  Excellent dish!

This recipe is FANTASTIC!  It was so quick and easy.  I wasn't sure before I made it if I would like the blend of juices with the garlic and onion, but it was just wonderful.  It tastes like something you'd pay big bucks for in a fancy restaurant and is the dish I would serve to friends that I wanted to impress.

I substituted Tilapia and my husband says it's the best fish I ever made! Easy, delicious, wholesome recipe. I served it with asparagus and a rice pilaf -- yum!

This was absolutely delish!  The sauce was a bit tart, but I used the juice from one lemon, one lime, and one orange.  (So I went heavier with the lemon than the recipe called for.) If you don't want it too tart, just use more orange juice.  I also used shallots instead of the green onions.  The entire cooking of the meal came together in under 10 minutes....amazing!  Served it with rice and asparagus.  It was such a light and refreshing fish recipe.  Thanks for submitting it.

Very tasty & perfect for dinner guests! It has a great presentation.  I used tilapia instead of orange roughy.  I also used the juice of half a lemon and 4 or 5 tblsp. of orange juice and the sauce was not too tart at all.  Next time I may use PAM instead of oil to fry the fish.  Also, I suggest doing the sauce in a separate pan from the fish and have them both going at the same time so that the sauce is ready as soon as the fish is done.  This doesn't give the fish a chance to cool down at all or get soggy.

I love how the fish turned out but I didn't care for the sauce. Im so glad I tasted it before I poured in onto the fish. It was way sour for my liking. Will use this again for the fish.

This was a real hit with my family.  I took the advice of other reviewers, and used more orange juice than lime juice.  The proportions I used were: 3 T orange juice, 2 T lime juice, 1 T lemon juice.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  This was good with couscous and the Green Beans with Walnuts recipe from this site. Definitely a keeper!

I gave this recipe four stars because I made a few modifications to the recipe.  I didn't have any fresh orange juice, so I used a Tablespoon of frozen orange juice concentrate.  I also added 1/2 or 1 tsp (I didn't measure!) of honey because I had read other reviews that said it was too bitter.  It took away just a little of that bite from the citrus.  It was really good!  We used it with some Wild Alaskan Salmon that I seasoned with salt and pepper, seared on high heat, and then finished off in the oven.  The citrus complimented the buttery salmon very nicely.  I'm going to use the extra sauce over some asparagus tonight.

Pretty good.  I served the sauce on the side and had some left over with just two fish fillets.  I thought it was too tart, but my husband liked it the way it was.  Next time I might use more orange juice and less lime juice.

I give this 4 stars because of the sauce...I will look for a way to thicken it.  My husband loved it and so did my picky 11yo.  I liked the crispness of the fish but the sauce made it soggy very quickly.  This would be a good sauce for any type of fish.  Thanks for sharing : )

I've never had orange roughy before, so was surprised when hubby brought it home...the fish, as directed, was really yummy and flaky. NOT fishy at all!  We LOVE citrus sauces and gravies on salmon and chicken - - but this sauce was WAAY too strong on the tart-side. That being said, the next time we make this (which I WILL!) I'll HALF the lemon and lime, and DOUBLE the orange juice, and let it reduce to half. Hubby also likes things spicy, so we added a few drops of habanero sauce w/ mango (Crazy Jerry's Brain Damage - it's awesome!), which added another yummy layer of flavor...I'm sure your favorite hot sauce will do just fine...  Anyhow - only 3 stars, cuz I had to mess w the recipe so much...other than that, a total keeper which I'll be making again!!!

This was a good simple recipe. Very easy to make. It didn't make much sauce, so next time I think I'll double it.

This recipe has real potential, but is not perfect.  The sweetness of the orange juice is NOT enough to counteract the tartness of the lemon and lime juices.  There is no balance.  To correct this problem, I suggest adding pineapple juice to taste.  I was not overly impressed with this recipe, because I expect perfection and was disappointed in myself for not realizing the problem before presenting this to the dinner table.  I give it a four star rating only because of the potential for excellence.

Giving this 5 stars based on the suggestions.  Fish alone was delicious and I'm not crazy about orange roughy.  I made sure the fish was crispy. Increased the orange juice to 3 T and decreased lime to 1 T, still added a bit of sugar will try it without next time.  I served the sauce on the side to avoid the sogginess issue and let people add to taste. My little food critics loved it!...and I did too!! So easy, definitely will do again.

I must have done something wrong. The sauce was way too tart and the sauce made the crust soggy. I won't make this again.

The fish turned out great but the sauce was extremely tart, too much.  Next time I'll reduce the lime and lemon and increase the orange juice.  I'm thinking that mango might go well with this too.  But as is, it's way too sour to the point where we were scraping off as much sauce as possible.

This was wonderful. Few mods to serve own palate were that I added a 2 tbsp of sweet chili sauce, after following instructions by others to reduce lemon and lime and increase orange. Sensational result, work with it, served over couscous, excellent

My husband normally would not touch fish, but he said this is the best thing I've made him so far.  He commented that it had very little "fishy" taste to it.  It was rather easy to prepare as well.

This recipe was good....i had to double it tho.. there wasnt enough sauce to cover all of the fish(I only used two fillets).
I would have liked more taste...it needed alittle something more in my opinion.. everyone that ate it liked it tho..so maybe it was just me.

This recipe was not very good at all.  If you like to suck lemons you will love this stuff.  I made it exactly as written...Read this way "I wasted a bunch of time shopping for lemons, limes and fresh parsely."  However, the result was wasted time and money.  Funny thing here is that the stars don't allow a rating for taste.

Tasty.  My husband who doesn't really like fish said he would have it again.  Sauce has very strong flavor (good though), so I suggest serving it on the side instead of pouring over the fish when serving.

Well this was very good however like other viewers; I added my own twist.  I didn't have oj however I did have "Perfect Mai Tai" left over from my hubby's 40th birthday party Saturday night.  You got it.  I substituted the Mai Tai for the OJ plus I matched in measurement with pineapple juice plus I added 1-2 tbsp. of crushed pineapples.  
The other thing I did was make white rice and added some of the citrus sauce to the rice and added crushed pineapple to the rice as well.  Great side dish!

I only gave this 4 stars because of the tweaking this recipe needs.  I decreased the lemon and lime and added extra oj, Next time I'll decrease the lemon and lime even more and add more oj.  It was still good, so I'll keep trying!

My family and I were tired of the same old fish dishes.  This one is WOW!!!  My daughter raved and my husband was a very happy camper. Better than resturant.

This is the 2nd time I’ve made this.  I omitted the lime (because I have orange and lemon trees).  I used 6 tbs of each and added it to the sautéed garlic, along with the scallions.  I was able to cook down this liquid to a nice sauce consistency. Didn’t add the butter, but I’m sure it would have had a richer texture – just watching calories.  I also just dust the fish with “Wonder”.  Worked out great. A 5 is something that I would make on a regular basis and also good enough for company.  (For company, I'd add the butter)

I had followed everyone's advice on reducing the lemon and lime and added extra orange juice.
I also added black pepper with salt and coated it with flour since we like it hot here at my house.
Definitely would try it again and everyone at home liked it, even though it was not something that we usually make at my house.

I printed up about 4 recipes for orange roughy and had my husband pick the one that sounded the best to him, and he picked this one.
My family raved over this dish.  It was to tart for me, but I added some salt to the sauce and it was fine, also, I left the sauce on the side, so everyone could add the amount they wanted.

I made this dish last night for my family and it was a huge hit.  It was easy to prepare and had a beautiful presentation.  I served it with a fresh salad and baked sweet potatoes for a healthy dinner.  I did follow suggestions of others and reduced the lemon by a bit and increased the orange juice.  I will make this many more time!!!!

I took others advice and reduced the lime and lemon and added more oj, and used minced vidalia onion instead of green onions.  But it turned out pretty good.  Not a bite was left on anyone's plate!

Very good and easy to make.  I changed the reciped some since I did
not have green onions so substituted 1/2 chopped onion instead.  Also you can 
disregard the orange juice and add more lemon - works just fine.

This was just OK....but mostly because of a mess up on my part.  I substituded dried parsley and garlic in the sause which made a big diffrence Im sure in the way it should have turned out.  Will try it again with fresh herbs and garlic the next time around.

The citrus sauce was wonderful.  I baked the orange roughy in milk and butter to make it very mild (in hopes my fish-hating toddler would eat it) and served the sauce in a separate dish.  Yum!!  I substitued finely minced red onion for the scallions.  For some reason my some of my minced garlic turned robin's egg blue.  Really odd...but colorful.

I made this with a bag of the frozen orange roughy fillets.  It was delicious.  Soaking them in milk takes the fishy taste away.  When I made it, I revised it and used no oil, just a non-stick pan and Pam.  It was delicious and relatively easy!

This is a wonderful recipe! The only thing I will do differently next time is to add a bit more orange juice. I roasted veggies with garlic and parm on the side, and I will make extra sauce to add over veggies next time. This recipe would also be good for Mahi

We loved this dish.  Added a bit more fresh squeezed orange juice to the sauce and an extra tablespoon of butter just to make it sing.  I wish I'd purchased more filets because we all wanted more.  Very light, but satisfying.

The actual fish was amazing. So delicate and flaky. However, the fish did get a bit soggy. And the sauce is way too strong. 
Next time I will make the sauce first, then make the fish. I'll also increase the butter (like easily 2-3 times more) and maybe add some honey like others have mentioned. This recipe has huge potential if the sauce could only be more delicate to complement the fish.

I used half lemon juice and half orange juice for all the citrus juices because that's what I had on hand and reduced the butter by half and this turned out great.  Attractive dish and easy to prepare.

Perfectly delicious!  I can honestly say that this preparation is one of the best I've ever had of orange roughy.  The only addition I made was to add about 1/2 tsp of white sugar to the citrus juices.  The fish was fantastic served along side a simple turmeric basmati rice pilaf with dried cranberries and green onions.  Soaking the fish in milk before frying took away ALL of the fishy taste.

It was too tart for my family.  I thought that it had a great flavor.  Love the lime.  This may sound strange but I think that a little coconut juice or sweetened shredded coconut would be a great addition.  I think I will try that next time.

This was really good.  I'm not much of a fish fan, but with a mild fish like roughy and this wonderful sauce, this was great.  I didn't have but 1 lime, so the rest of the 3Tb I made up with the orange juice.  That might have kept it a bit milder than intended.  I also didn't have green onions, so chopped some red.  Everything else was as directed.  I served it on a bed of couscous with a side of steamed broccoli.  I WILL be making this again.

I looked for an Orange Roughy recipe and found this one. Knowing my husband does not like lemon, I was a bit skeptical. We both loved it!!! Great!   Thanks! Donna

This was so delicious!  My whole family raved about it, my Mom even asked for the recipe.  I'm always looking for new ways to try fish in my diet and this will definately be made again!

Excellent recipe! Very easy and extremely tasty. I made exactly as stated with two exceptions - fresh cilantro intstead of parsley and 1/2 T of very thinly sliced red pepper for color. OUTSTANDING recipe - try it!

This was my first time cooking with orange roughy, and I'll definitely be cooking it again. I loved the delicate flavor and firm texture. The only changes I made were to increase the oj as I thought it was way too tart (take care tasting the sauce if you've got chapped lips. OUCH...). I decided to stick with the parsley even though I'm not a fan. It was good but I think cilantro might be a better choice. All in all, this was a really easy and flavorful meal. Thanks, Karen!

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out beautifully.  I'd never heard to soak the fish in milk before but will use that tip from now on.  The fish turned out golden brown and crunchy and the sauce just kicked everything up a notch.

Excellent!  We would not change a thing.  It is a great light recipe for a mild white filet of fish.  We are big fans of Orange Roughy and are always looking at different ways to dress this great meaty but mild fish.  We served it with jasmine rice and green beans.  We made a little extra sauce to drizzle over our rice as well.

This recipe was awesome!  
The milk+flour combo was not only easy, it worked great too; and the sauce was one of the best I've had! I substituted the cilantro for the parsley, and red onions for the green . It gave it a nice little kick. 
My boyfriend and I both loved this dish; I'll definitely make it again!

I've made this recipe 5 times now, and it has been AWESOME every time. I've had to substitute cilantro for the green onions, or spray butter for the real butter, or peach lemonade mix for the orange juice, and it still gets RAVE reviews from my family. OUtstanding recipe, I'll keep it forever and make it often.

This was very good!  I would add more salt next time (personal preference) and decrease the lime just a bit.  We enjoyed it a lot and hubby said we should have it again in the near future.

This is a good basic recipe. I changed it a little to suit what I had, here are the changes. I used tilapia, cilantro rather than parsley, red onion in place of green and dobled the lime juice instead of lemon juice. It turned out yummy!

This has been by far my favorite seafood recipe from this site.  I used talapia, as I didn't have any orange roughy, and I didn't have any orange juice, but I did have some left over salsa from grilled swordfish with citrus salsa.  So I measured out tablespoons of the juice from that, added some basil (didn't have parsley)and minced onion (no green onions).  I doubled the sauce, and it was just enough for 4 filets.    I added some of the flour that I dredged the fish in at the end to thicken it up.  It was just the BEST!!

Taking the advice of other reviewers, I was heavy on the orange juice and lighter on the lime and lemon juices. I liked the crunch of the onions and the color of the parsley - my sauce, however, never got really creamy notwithstanding the addition of butter. Next time, I may add some flour to the sauce to get a creamier consistency I think I would enjoy more. But overall, a lovely dinner.

After a few slight modifications, it was a big hit with the family!  I lightened up on the butter a bit and used dried parsley flakes.  Excellent dish!

I served this to guests with children ranging from 3 years old to 17.  They all loved it ... although the sauce was a litte too "tangy" for the little ones.  Otherwise, it's a definite, "make again!"

The Citrus Sauce was too overpowering for the delicate taste of the Orange Roughy.

I as looking for a recipe I could use for some frozen pollock fillets I had, and this
worked very well! The fillets didn't hold together as nicely and the roughy does, I imagine, but it tasted wonderful and the kids loved it!
Will definetely use this again!

I made this for my family and they all agreed.......IT WAS DELICIOUS!
  
A recipe for dinner guests!
 
To speed up the cooking time, I used 2 skillets and while the fish was frying, I had all the other ingredients warming and ready pour.
Don't hesitate..........make this one!!
