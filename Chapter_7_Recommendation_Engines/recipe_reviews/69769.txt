Delicious. I used some bottled Thai Chili Sauce instead of the paste and did pea pods instead of just peas. Used a touch more chili sauce than called for and left out the additional salt, but kept everything else the same. Definitely a keeper.

Super-delicious, spicy-hot noodles. Very quick and easy! The only change I made was sprinkling 1 Teaspoon sesame seed before serving....it gave the extra hint of authentic flavor!

Not the best. It was really dry. The peas made it pretty gross, and I like peas. Sorry, but I won't be making this again

Really really yummy!!
I added a few extra things though: 
Minced chicken, onion, tomatoes and mushrooms and that made it even better. It was deliciously spicy!

Yum!!  this reminds of my favorite thai noodle dishes, although it does not taste the same it could be a cousin of the pad thai dish.
I changed it a little... I could not find chili paste so I used 1/4 cup "thai style chili sauce".  I also added chicken and another egg.  
I will definetly make this again, I think next time I will replace the peas with broccoli.  The peas were good, just want to try something different.

i didn't care for this meal - it was kind of bleh...i used sziracha instead of chili paste and it didnt have enough depth with the only other flavor being ketchup. the spinach gets lost with so many noodles so i added shrimp, orange pepper and pea pods instead of peas. the noodles were kind of soggy and stuck together too. and one package of noodles is way way too much for 4 people! my husband said I should actually give it 2 stars but i thought it tasted fine enough so i gave it 3....

This was ok. It has a lot of potential though. The only changes I made were to use baby bok choi instead of spinach (I don't like the sludgy texture of spinach when it's cooked) plus I mixed some chili garlic sriracha into the Thai paste for some extra kick. I didn't really like the peas in this - if I were to make it again, I would use snow peas. This was a quick, easy and pretty healthy meal. It needs a few tweaks though.
