Absolutely delicious, however I did find that while making the tart the sugar content seemed excessive. I halved the quantity and the tart was a winner! I live in Portugal at the moment and the good thing is all the ingredients should be available anywhere you live, but the tart would be a hit anywhere!

This is FABULOUS!!!!!  Seriously, I can't praise it enough!!  I am a budding pastry chef and made this as a special when the head pastry chef was out of town.  The one and only thing I changed was I subbed pecans for the walnuts (I think they have a nicer flavor), but otherwise made the tart to the letter, and it was PERFECT!!!!  I used our restaurant's all-purpose shortbread recipe for the crust, and I brushed the crust with egg whites before baking, and it couldn't have been simpler or turned out any better!  I got rave reviews from the guests, the sous chef, all the servers, and the boss/executive chef.  This is on my stand-by dessert specials list!!  Put it this way....  If I can proudly serve this as a special at a high-end restaurant, then you know its a winner!!

good recipe. I was really happy how it turned out! used unsweetened coconut -worked out well. this is a very sweet recipe! be sure it take it out of the oven even if the center is wobbly.. once in cools it does harden up a bit. I made up a mixture of brown sugar, chopped walnuts, coconut and boiling water and used this to surround the tart after it cooled.  cheers!

Personally I don't think it needs to be baked in a crust. It is a nice variation of impossible pie, and I love the walnut coconut combination. I used under a cup of sugar and it was more than sweet enough, and next time I would make it with even less sugar,I think, and no crust. 5 stars as it is very very easy to make and great tasting.

I thought at first this came out completely wrong, but I think it's supposed to be a little goopy. I wish there was more information on what the end product is exactly (texture/consistency). Great with vanilla ice cream because it is pretty rich.
