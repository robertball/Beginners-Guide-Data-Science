If you leave a little bacon grease in the skillet when you cook the burgers,  it makes them even better

These burgers were great. Put swiss cheese and mushrooms on top with the bacon and they were delicious!

Turned out well...you couldn't tell there was deer in them.  We didn't have any Guiness so we used Yuengling.  Worked out well, I think!

Weather was too nice...took these to the grill, FANTASTIC!  I've made them both inside and out...either way, delicious!  Smoked cheese, mushrooms and onions on top.  PERFECTION!

Very good except I left out the beer. You could substitute apple juice if you wanted too.

I made these burgers tonight and my husband and I both loved them. I didn't have much ground beef so I used mostly venison. I added some Spike seasoning to the meat mixture as well as some Worcestershire sauce and beer. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I'll definitely make these again.

I didn't use Worcestershire Sauce. 
I added:
Hotshot's red & black pepper 
1 capful of hickory liquid smoke
(I don't typically measure my spices I add until it smells right) 

I also added chopped onions to the meat mixture. 
I used Yuengling instead of a stout which worked fine. 
Swish cheese for the finish and everyone loved them.

Very good. I could not detect the venison. I topped them with grilled onion, gorgonzola cheese and bacon!

Very good, and very firgiving on amounts. I ended up using 2 pounds of ground venison and only a half pound of hamburger, because of the seasoning, you still couldn't taste any gaminess to the meat!
