I tweaked this recipe quite a bit to get more flavor: I used Italian sausage,  only half the cream cheese, added shallots and garlic along with the chopped stems to the cooking sausage and Italian seasonings. When the sausage was cooked, I drained it and then mixed in the cream cheese with about 1/2 cup of bread crumbs and 1/2 cup red wine. I did not add the wine to the pan that they baked in.

This is a great recipe for when entertaining guests at your house. I used it for a football party this weekend and they were a hit. I had to modify this recipe a bit because like one of the other reviewers said, the mixture made more mushrooms than what is in the recipe. 
The recipe calls for 2 packages of cream cheese but I only used one package. 
I also used red port wine instead of regular red wine. In my opinion, port wine has a more flavorful taste that I think is better paired with mushrooms. Since there were alot more mushrooms then intended I ended up using 1 and 1/4 cups of the port wine because some of this is to pour overtop the mushrooms before you put them in the oven.
The recipe says it makes 18 mushrooms but I ended up making 45 mushrooms. They weren't small mushrooms either, medium to large sized mushrooms, and since I only used 1 pack of cream cheese I was surprised that the mixture still was too much. I could imagine how many more mushrooms I would have needed if I had followed the recipe and used 2 packs of cream cheese. 
Plus, although I ended up w/ 45 mushrooms in the end I only used the stems from the original 18 mushrooms for the stuffing mixture. 
Note when baking: When you place these mushrooms in your baking dish make sure you put them in there touching each other. If not then they may not stand up straight and roll over. It also helps some of the wine on the bottom of the pan to cook all the caps of the mushrooms evenly.

I've made these mushrooms on a couple of occassions.  The first time I made them I followed the recipe as directed and wound up with a lot of extra filling.  I also didn't care too much for the taste that the wine left on the mushrooms when they were cookin in it.  The next time I made them I added some worcestershire sauce to the mix that they cook in and absolutely loved them!! Both ways however they were a huge hit!

Think the mushrooms would have tasted better without the wine added in the end. I've used other stuffed mushroom recipes that were easier  than this one.

I scaled this recipe to make 8 stuffed mushrooms. Personally i did not like them, but my husband did. The wine poured over top made them pretty soggy and gross. I did not mind the wine added to the stuffing. I might make them again and skip the wine.

Reduced the recipe two two servings. Used Alouette instead of plain cream cheese; added garlic and fresh ground black pepper. Didn't add the wine.

I have made this recipe for just about every function I host or attend. Everytime it is a huge hit! The recipe does make a huge amount of filling when it only asks for 18 mushrooms. But it's the perfect amount for me because I usually make a ton of it. I highly recommend this recipe.

I love this recipe! It was the first time I made stuffed mushrooms, so I was apprehensive, but this recipe is so simple. And everyone LOVES them. I have had to make them by request on several occasions. I do make a few changes to the recipe: I use Jimmy Dean Sage sausage, Italian breadcrumbs, low fat cream cheese and I make about 40-50 mushrooms with this recipe (I use all of the stems in the stuffing mix). If I have extra stuffing leftover, I just put it in tupperware and store it in the freezer. I know I'm going to make more soon... so then I have some ready to go!

These are so good! Like other reviewers suggested, I cut the cream cheese in half and still had plenty of stuffing for the mushrooms.We didn't cut back on the wine and it added lots of flavor.

This recipe is good but I made a few changes and it was wonderful! I added about 1/4 C of parmesan cheese to the stuffing and cut the cream cheese in half ( it made enough filling for a second batch even though I cut down on the cream cheese). I also substituted beef broth for red wine, since I'm not 21 yet :), and it turned out delicious!

I made a few changes to the recipe as well. First, I did not use the wine. I only used one package of cream cheese and added chopped celery and scallions to the mixture. I baked for about 20 minutes at 350.  Even with only one package of cream cheese, I had enough for more than 36 baby bella mushrooms (which vary in size). They were a big hit!

Five stars is not enough!  A very simple to make recipe.  I deviated from my regular stuffed mushroom recipe and tried this one out on my family for our Thanksgiving dinner. Adjusted the recipe to 15 and they are all gone!  Bravo! The only change I made is that I used fresh sausage from the local butcher and I replaced the bread crumbs with sage stuffing mix which I ground in the food processor. Very flavorful!

My family LOVED these, even though my husband doesn't like mushrooms, he ate three of them! I didn't use any red wine, as the mixture tasted delicious by itself, and I didn't mix in the chopped stems either, figured there was enough of the mushroom taste. I stuffed these about 4 hours prior to dinner, then just threw them in the oven when I started cooking the main course.

I made these tonight with a few modifications. Instead of ground sausage I used fully cooked turkey sausage links. I chopped them into very small pieces, added some finely chopped onion, garlic, a little cayenne pepper, basil and old bay seasoning. Put it in a skillet with a drizzle of olive oil to infuse all the flavors. Then added it to a package of cream cheese mixed with some sharp cheddar cheese. Sprinkled italian bread crumbs on top and baked! They were all gone and absolutely amazing!

I agree that this recipe does take a little more effort than other stuffed mushroom recipes.  But, sometimes the effort put into a recipe makes the end result something that is worth the work.  The quality of the recipe will depend on the kind of wine that one uses.  Something not too dry and toward the fruity side made this wonderful!!  I had several people ask for directions.

I made this recipe exactly as shown except I used country sausage instead of plain. It came out delish. I needed more than the recipe called for so I created two batches. I would NOT recommend doubling the recipe. it came out so good. I some stuffing left over so I baked them separately as little meatballs. Very good! Bon Apetite!

This is one of my most requested dishes.  I don't measure anymore...  However I mix them they are always an absolute hit.   As others have mentioned, you end up with extra filling... I just freeze it and stuff it into other things... Wonton wrappers, tortillas etc....  Whatever I make with it people love.

I LOVE this recipe. I use only a little WHITE wine in the mixture, and also add parmesan cheese to it. Instead of pouring the wine over, I dip/quickly soak the caps in the leftover wine and then stuff them. Its fun to play around with this recipe.
