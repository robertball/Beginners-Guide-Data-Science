made this for a staff summer gathering and nothing was left which is a good sign. used a lemon white balsamic vinegar and a milanese gremolata olive oil. oven pilaf rice was perfect.   very tasty after 24 hrs.

I did not have sherry vinegar, so we mixed rice wine vinegar with some sherry we had on hand.
The rice made in the oven is fantastic! This will be our new way of making perfect rice!!!
