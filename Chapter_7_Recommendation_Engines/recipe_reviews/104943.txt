This tuna salad is fabulous!  I love the lemon flavor and blend of fresh herbs.  It's a nice change from the regular tuna salads I'm used to - this is a definite keeper!

This is truly the taste of a tuna salad you would find in a high-end sandwich shop.  I am single so I just ate one sandwich per day for 4 days....and I looked forward every day to eating this!
This is a great way to use fresh herbs from your garden!

I followed this recipe exactly and it was WONDERFUL! This is a great alternative to the egg versions of tuna salad I grew up on. I hosted a baby shower and made finger sandwiches everyone RAVED!! Thanks for the new spin on an old fav!

This is by far the best tuna salad I've ever tasted.  It's so fresh tasting!  It's quickly becoming a summer staple around here because I have all of those lovely fresh herbs in the garden.

I absolutely loved this recipe!!! It was a great way to use fresh herbs from my garden. You have to love tarragon to enjoy this. The tarragon and lemon together are really good, fresh tasting and flavorful. I found this to be very delicious and not too herby for my taste. Oh well, to each their own!!

This was OK.  It was a bit too herby for me.  The flavor was stronger than I like.

I used an envelope of albacore tuna, which is about 7 oz., so I decided not to even measure the other ingredients, but I used them all and didn't make any substitutions, and I liked the results.  Very different from my usual mayo-and-sweet-pickle combo, but in a nice, fresh, healthy-tasting way.  Will make again.

I thought this was OK. The flavors didn't wow me and it lacked the crunch, so i added fresh onions and pickles. I probably won't make again.

I didn't have any provolone cheese and for some reason my tarragon is missing (I didn't grow any in my garden), but this was still an easy and awesome tuna salad, I ate it all in one sitting! I can't wait to try it with the provolone and tarragon, thanks for the great recipe!

This was good, but it would have been better without the parsley.  The parsley I used fresh was very bitter.  I will omit the parsley the second time around.  I also added a few finely chopped onions instead of the chives.  I will make again with the corrections above.

I love tuna salad, and this recipe was AMAZING! The fresh herbs were a great twist. I used Swiss Cheese and made tuna melts out of mine. I will definitely never be eating plain old tuna salad again.

Really delicious!  Some really nice herby flavors I don't usually eat.  We paired this with Butternut Squash Soup with Sage Butter and Zippy Radish Salad (trying to use up our CSA veggies and herbs) and it made for a very colorful, fragrant, delicious lunch.  Cooking it was almost as yummy as eating it because the smells were awesome!  I love fresh herbs :-)

I had some fresh tarragon and chives that needed using so I made this early yesterday morning so it would have time to "cure."  I ate some on a sandwich for lunch and frankly it had no tarragon or chive taste at all.  DH had some for dinner and after one bite dumped a bunch of dill relish in his.  I ate the leftovers for lunch today and it had a very slight taste of tarragon.  Overall I would say this didn't do anything for us and I probably won't make it again.

Absolutely wonderful!  This is tuna salad at it's best.  I used dried herbs instead of fresh and it was great!  Will definitely use this recipe again and again and again.  Thanks!

This was wonderful.  I highly highly recommend!!.  But I'm so sorry I did not have fresh herbs nor chives.  Used 2 green onions finely chopped. Used 2 Tbsp dried parsley and 1 heaping Tbsp of dried tarragon, 3/4 tsp Dijon mustard (I had the HOT variety). I used 2 1/2 cans of Tuna, one of which was oil packed (oh yum!). I even forgot the pepper and it was STILL delish!!  I will add pepper as I use it.  Didn't put it in a sandwich.  Will pass on the bread and just have it as an open salad on lettuce with the cheese and tomato.  Thank you!

After decades of tuna salad made with Miracle Whip and dill pickles, I'm making the switch to this recipe.  I have these herbs and the tomatoes growing in my garden and I think using these just picked ingredients along with the lemon, made for a very fresh tasting sandwich. I didn't use any cheese because I thought it might dull the taste.  I agree with Jillian, this is a keeper.

I wanted to say I didn't like it, but I had to change that because if you like tarragon then this is for you.  I was not really sure what tarragon tasted like, but this recipe let me know that I am not a fan.  The smell of tarragon puts me in the mind of black licorice and since I don't like black licorice, then that's probably why this didn't agree with my taste buds.  I used fresh parsley and fresh tarragon and it seemed like this had too much herb in it for me.  I spent the majority of the time trying to balance out the herb taste when the recipe probably wants it to taste like that.  To balance, I added 3 hard-boiled eggs, more pepper, more lemon juice, more mayonnaise, sweet relish, and garlic. The sweetness from the relish and mayo helped take away the bitterness.  The lemon juice helped soften the tarragon blow.

I really enjoyed this tuna salad, as the lemon and fresh herbs gave it a wonderful, fresh taste.  I brought it to work for lunch and scooped a little into romaine lettuce leaves along with a slice or two of orange pepper, and it was so good.  Thanks for the recipe!

Used dried herbs, adjusting amounts to compensate.  Good, but definitely is strong on the tarragon.

I've always been a fan of tuna, but this recipe is absolutely AMAZING. The only twist I did was to use dried tarragon, because I didn't have any fresh, it still was sooo good. It also works with green onion instead of chives, if those are difficult to find for you.
