These cookies flatten out way too much and am wondering about the three sticks of butter--perhaps it should just be 1 cup?  This last time I added about 1/4 c more flour  and stuck the sheets in the freezer before baking, but to no avail.  I even stuck them all back in the oven to hopefully crispen them up but that didn't work either.  That being said, these taste so wonderful even though they were wimpy, I ended up just folding them in half so they weren't so messy.  Taste gets at least 5 stars because they are delicious, but there is something wrong that they just totally flatten out but yet don't get crispy at all...

These cookies turned out perfect! I used a large cookie scoop and cooked them at 325 for 19 minutes. Could not have asked for a better cookie.

These cookies are for the serious chocoholic which I confess, I am one.  I love dark chocolate and these are perfect, especially with the addition of cherries. These are little morsels of chocolate love. My warped sense of humor always kicks in when I read chocolate cookies are to be baked until golden. I must be missing something.
