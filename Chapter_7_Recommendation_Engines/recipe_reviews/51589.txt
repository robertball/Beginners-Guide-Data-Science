Oh man this was as good as it gets! But I do have to admit that i added alot of my own seasoning to the sauce and the cheese. Otherwise it may have been a little bland. Garlic powder, salt, pepper, adobo seasoning, they all work good. mmm it was very good and my husband loved it, my mom loved it and my 3 year old ate about 4 of them!

Great, simple recipe.  I added some parsley for additional color.  Next time I will use another half a jar of sauce to prevent dryness.  The leftovers were yummy.

YUMMY!!!  If the shells aren't covered in sauce they are hard around edges.  So much easier than manicotti...

These were very good and easy to make.  Next time, I might like a little spices added to the cheese mixture - maybe some garlic or italian spices.

Excellent, I have made this a few times.  I think it helps to add some italian seasoning to the cheese, and use homemade red sauce.

This is the basic recipe I use but I add a few other ingredients.  1/4 cup of chopped parsley and 1 small defrosted package of chopped spinich. (The spinich is thawed, rinsed and squeesed dry with all the water squeesed out by paper towels) then the parsley and squeesed dry spinich is mixed in with the cheese mixture before it is all stuffed into shells.  This is my most requested dish. My grandson loves them.

what a delicious recipe! the only change i made was the addition of about 3/4 lb. browned ground beef to the sauce then stirring in a clove of chopped  garlic &  a healthy 1/2 c. chopped onion (both were sauteed in a little olive oil). try to let your sauce simmer awhile so it all the flavors come together! thanks buitoni!

This was excellent! I would recomend you add some chicken or beef to the stuffing and a little more marinara sauce.

Very good. I would par-boil the shells next time, they came out a little hard.

I gave this five stars because it serves its purpose well.  It's fast, easy and filling.  No more, no less.  I also added spinach to make it more healthy.

This was just "eh" in my household. It was a little bland, so I would consider using a little salt in the cheese mixture. Otherwise, it was pretty good. I served this with the jalapeno pepperoni bread and it was a good hearty meal. :)

This was a big hit with the family especially my 1 year old daughter. Ive never seen her eat so fast and so good before. Next time I will be doubling the recipe becuase it didnt seem like it was enough for us all.
