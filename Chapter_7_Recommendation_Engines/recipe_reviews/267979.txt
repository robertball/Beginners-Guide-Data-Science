The cereal got soggy during the baking process, creating a weird texture in each bite. Before I baked my second pan, I went through the dough and picked out all the cereal pieces. Without the cereal, these cookies were delicious!

These are so good!! I followed the recipe exactly. Be use to go no longer than 15 minutes. Once you start to broil them they can get hard kinda quick. I don't think this recipe would be good for smaller cookies. Those were overcooked fast, kinda my fault too. Enjoyed these!!
