Loved this pizza! I used easy pizza sauce III from here, and lots of feta cheese. I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried. I didn't have any rosemary other than Italian seasoning blend, so I skipped it. The basil and feta went well together, I made several different pizzas, but this was my personal favorite.
UPDATE: I made this again along with a meat pizza for the family's Friday Pizza Night and this one was hands down the favorite as it disappeared while over half the meat pizza was left. I used Mike's homemade pizza sauce and dough, fresh basil nearly the whole package (about 12-14 leaves) torn, and plenty of feta cheese. I always make two pizzas, one for them (meat for the men) and just cheese, thai chicken, fruit or veggie/cheese for me, and this is the first time they actually wanted to eat (and devoured) the other pizza.

Everyone loved it!  I made it with fresh basil from our garden on flatbread instead of the pizza dough which made the recipe a tad healthier.  With flatbread, this is a very easy 15 minute meal.

Great! I used a ton of basil (just generously covered the pizza with whole leaves), and added a little mozzerella with the goat cheese. This is easier than I expected (I'm not into dough much), and a LOT less expensive than takeout. Thanks!

Tasty. I used a refrigerated pizza crust and spaghetti sauce instead of the Italian tomato sauce.

This was excellent way to eat pizza without it being too heavy.  I used my own dough and a jarred red sauce with basil.  Also added a small amount of fresh mozzarella.  It was perfect!

Hubby says a 3, I say a 5....so, I'll split it down the middle.  Used the Exquisite Pizza Sauce recipe from this site.  Yum!!  Added a lot more basil and extra fresh rosemary.  This was a good pizza!

Delicious! This one's real easy to make and quick. I used a boboli pre-made crust and it turned out great. Add italian seasoning and garlic to the crust for a little italian kick.

Great pizza.  We loved it but made our own crust from scratch.  We will add more garlic next time but loved a new twist on an old favorite.

Love it!
I used the Jiffy pizza crust mix since I like I crispier crust.  I added some fresh garlic and tomatoes also.  I will definitely make again, and probably will and some more basil and rosemary next time!!

Hubby and I thought it was okay but not delicious. We enjoy many cheeses. The goat cheese was fine but not exciting. We added more fresh basil and some mozzarella (as suggested from below), which we were glad we did. Also, we used the refrigerated french bread dough.

Very nice pizza!  I used the Garlic lover's Pizza Crust for the dough and used dried--not fresh--basil.  I have learned I don't like my fresh basil cooked; I prefer it cold and fresh or dried and cooked, so I didn't use fresh at all.  I like all the flavors in this; the goat cheese makes for a sharp taste that goes well with the basil, rosemary, and sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great.  I am a big fan of goat cheese and prior to making this haven't had it in years.  I used the Boboli pizza crust instead of making my own and it came out great.   I will certainly make this again.

I loved this recipe and so did my 2 1/2 year old. My husband however, couldn't even finish one piece. Bummer. I give it a four anyway.

I used a small, ready-made whole wheat crust and cooked it in my toaster oven. It was so quick to prepare. The flavours were wonderful. The only thing I added was a little garlic. I will definitely make this again and experiment with other toppings.

Yummy pizza, but I couldn't stand the idea of not adding a little chicken. :) I took some pre-made grilled chicken strips and cut them into bite-size bits... that is the only change I made. Excellent pizza! Hubby was pleased.

Delicious and so easy, only change I made was to use flatbread since I only made a personal pizza for myself. Fresh herbs are absolutely key here. Next time I think I'll add some garlic powder for even more flavor.  thanks for sharing!

Great pizza! I made my own dough "Whole Wheat and Honey Pizza Dough" and "Exquisite Pizza Sauce" both from this site. I added some spinach and a little of muzzarella cheese besides the goat cheese. It was a nice change from what we usually have.

Loved it. I had to add some mozerella cheese too because I didn't have enough goat cheese. I also had to use spaghetti sauce and a store bought pizza crust. It all tasted great though!!

I had never even eaten goat cheese before making this recipe, but it was delicious!  I will definitely be making this again.  I will ease up on the pepper, though.

This is a great combination of flavors on a pizza, but we use pesto instead of the tomato sauce and use pizza dough instead of bread dough.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe.  There were no leftovers.  We used a little more basil and rosemary listed.  We used a pre-made Boboli thin crust.  Next time we would use a thicker crust.

I cheated and used Kroger pizza dough.  loved the goat cheese with basil and rosemary.  just the right amount of pizza for me, for tonight and tomorrow.
