The cookies were good, but they were really, really hard. I think the cornflakes may have sucked up all the moisture. Also, make sure to press the dough down, because they won't spread because of the baking powder. Also, I needed to cook them for about 20-30 minutes.

It really is delicious! I've been looking for a cornflake cookie recipe, and I had no idea it was so easy to make! I like my cookies small and crisp, so I left out the nuts and raisins, and added a pinch of salt.

I made these cookies because I had lots of leftover cornflake cereal.  I am sorry to say that these did not come out well at all for me.  They were on the dry side, somewhat hard and everyone complained they were too salty and did not have enough sugar.  I even tried a peanut butter version and replaced the raisins with choclate chips.  However, they were a very easy cookies to make and did not take too long.

This was a really easy to follow and accurate recipe. My tips to add: I used self raising flour and I did not crush the flakes which makes the cookie taste more crunchy and you can actually see the flakes. I followed your method and it turned out just great. Thank you so much for this! Unlike the other reviews, it did not turn out hard at all. The tips say that the cookies dont expand which is quite true so just press them down lightly if you want a bigger cookie. I also added 1 tspn of vanilla essence - a very good idea. Also baking time should be 15 minutes exactly at 175 deg celcius.

Here's what I did-I made 1 and 1/2 times the recipe, put in 2 eggs (1 and !/2 would have been difficult!), doubled the raisins (soak in hot water for 10 mns beforehand), and substituted baking soda for baking powder. I flattened the teaspoonfuls of dough with a fork dipped in sugar and followed the cooking time. They were great!

Good - a little dry, but reminded me a bit of a tiny scone.  A good cookie to go with tea or coffee.  I recommend making them very small. They weren't sweet at all, so while they were cooling I sprinkled powdered sugar over the top which helped.  I will make them again.  Thanks for the recipe!  Update: I used the base cookie recipe but instead of raisins, added dried pineapples, and then instead of cornflakes, I rolled them in shredded coconut.  Delicious.  Also tried rolling them in walnut pieces and added extra raisins to the batter.  Also very delicious.  So thanks for the base cookie recipe.

I baked these cookies for 15 minutes and added about 1 tsp. of vanilla extract for flavour.  I also substituted trail mix for the raisins.  My boyfriend seemed to like them, but he'll eat anything.  Overall they seemed to lack a little umph!!

This is really good. I did however cut down the sugar to 3 oz. I would suggest making smaller cookies so that you get more crunch.

Used chopped dates and pecans, rolled cookies in MAPLE SYRUP before  corn flakes.  Flattened cookies with a fork before baking. Teaspoon sized were good with 15 minute bake. This was my second attempt.

Will make again; I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 canola oil; also half whole wheat, half all purpose flour; soaked the raisins for 10 minutes, added 1 tsp vanilla; mixed the crushed cornflakes in rather than roll in them; baked for 15 minutes; added some mini chocolate chips to the batter for baking the last pan.  They're good while still warm right out of the oven, have a nice crunch which hopefully will last once they are cooled and packed away in a container.

Added coconut to the recipe with the cornflakes and put yogurt icing on top. Used a mixed berry yoghurt to give the icing some contrast and flavour. Yummo
