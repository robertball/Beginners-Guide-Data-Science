I made it twice - once with butter and the second time with coconut oil - both failed as brittle. Both bases balled up as soon as the pecans were added. What I got was two batches of sweet toasted pecans. Oh,well. Nice topping for salad, ice cream.

This isn't really a brittle, it is really just candied pecans.  There is not anywhere near enough of the sugar/butter mixture to make brittle with all those nuts.  I would maybe try it with 1/2 as much pecans, or twice as much of everything else.

This is SO easy and so delicious.  I used Almonds and Walnuts, but any combination of nuts (or pretzels or rice crispies or coconut) would work.  

I had researched and read that you should not stir your sugar when you make brittle, but that IS NOT the case with this recipe.  Because this recipe has butter, but no water, you can stir the sugar.  In fact, if you don't stir the sugar, it might burn. I know this, because I burnt my first batch - trying to be all fancy (actually, it was still pretty good).  However, my second batch was fantastic.  This would make a great gift.  
P.S. I used Wheylow Gold (a brown sugar substitute) so it was much lower in carbs.

Tasty, but not a "brittle".  Its just candied nuts. Falls apart.
