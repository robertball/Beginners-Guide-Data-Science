I used tilapia, and substituted seafood seasoning for the steak seasoning.  I would have incinerated the fish if I'd cooked as long as recommended--I think I cut cook time almost in half (just check the underside for color).  This was so incredibly, amazingly good--the fish was mild and flaky, the crust crunchy and satisfying.  Just season to your taste!

This was a very good recipe, but I have to agree with a previous reviewer on the time. About 2-3 minutes per side, tops!

This is similiar to another catfish  recipe that my family and I frequently cook made with mustard and corn meal.
That reciep to follow.

This is definitely a "keeper!" Nicely done!

Ahh the crust was so good. I used this crappy basa fish (basa is flavorless! but cheap, and all I had on hand), and didn't have cornmeal so instead used tempura flakes, which stuck better after an eggwash. Mmmmm. Way good. Also I didn't have buttermilk, so I found an alternative recipe using 1 tablespoon of lemon juice to 1 cup of milk. So I don't know how the recipe is really SUPPOSED tot taste like, but my poorcollegestudent version had the most delicious crust ever! I would have never thought to use grill seasoning. So good!

This is delicious! I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil, Swai for catfish, and onion powder instead of onion salt. The fish was the best I have ever made.

Tasty!  Fried mine in corn oil, and you definitely need to let it drain for a goodish while, or it is still pretty greasy.

I enjoyed this recipe. Its quick & easy and there are other seasonings that you can add to it to spruce it up even more! You have to be careful though. If you have some large fillets, you'll have to allow them to cook a little longer, but the recipe is great!

OK, but I thought it needed additional seasoning.  Good coating texture and color.

Wonderful -

Modified the steak seasoning amount because of a previous  review.  Cooked the fish on a grill on a griddle and it was wonderful - thank you.

The breading wanted to fall off while pan frying and the nuggets were quite greasy, aside from being very bland.

Five stars for flavor, but I have to knock one off for cook time - the fish would have been ruined at anything more than 3-4 min/side. Take that into consideration, and make this recipe, because the fish was moist and the coating was crispy and delicious.

Replace the cornmeal with panko breadcrumbs. You're welcome! :-)
