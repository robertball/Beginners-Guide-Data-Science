I’ve been making this for years, only much easier!!  Put bacon on foil-covered cookie sheet and place in a COLD oven.  Turn to 425, close oven an take out in 16 minutes (if bacon is fairly thick).  Let the grease solidify, gather the foil and throw it out.  VERY easy— we love it.  If your oven runs hot or is real new, I suggest you check it out in 14 minites.

I bake it at a higher temp. 400, I use tinfoil and it’s a easy clean up. May take less time.

amazing! with a crispy exterior, yet still juicy on the interior. I always worry about under-cooking bacon in the skillet and of oil splatter issues, so cooking it in the oven all at once with minimal effort was beautiful. There is more control over the cooking intensity and also the bacon doesn't come out dry and incinerated, but still has crispy edges. 
This recipe told me what I needed to know in super simple terms.

350 is waaaaaaaaaaaay too low. After 35 minutes I had to bump it to 400. Unless you like it raw take the temp up to 400.

I will NEVER make bacon any other way! After the 40 minutes of baking when I take them out I drizzle with real New York Maple Syrup and let them sit 5 minutes before serving...O My Lord..take me now! Thank you and God bless! Laura :-)

Tip - Make sure you use a heavy duty baking sheet, one that doesn’t warp. Be careful when taking the baking sheet from out of the oven, that the oil does spill over the sheet.

That's exactly how I cook bacon - perfection every time and much less clean-up. The bacon grease stays nice and white as well.

I use aluminum foil to bake my bacon.  I fry up a big package and refrig the rest for use during the week. Quick sandwiches and recipe ingredient ready for use.  Pour off the grease and most of the time I could just put the baking sheets back in the cabinet.  Very little mess and clean up.

I sometimes use the new copper crisper sheet and rack so grease drips off as it cooks. So much easier and great for bigger groups that bacon. You can sprinkle brown sugar on the bacon for a real treat!

I always do bacon in the oven and only difference is that I place the bacon on a cooling rack over the pan.

30 - 40 minutes to make bacon in an oven? That is just wrong. Frying bacon in a skillet takes about 12 minutes max and is so much better. And you can then use the bacon grease to fry your eggs. The trick is to put the bacon in a cold pan and bring it up to med/high heat and flip it often to your desired crispness. Cooking bacon is not rocket science. I am 60 plus and know what the heck I'm talking about.

I like my bacon a bit crispy so I bake it a bit longer.  This is the only way to go. I have a extra large pan with a rack it’s perfect for this recipe. No need to turn the bacon it cooks beautifully on both sides. It’s bacon so yeah 5 Stars

This is really good, that said, I followed Beth's VERY useful advice. Turned out perfectly. 

The only change I made was because i made an entire pound of bacon, I had to use 2 sheets, turned sideways; which cooked some pieces better than others, so i removed the better ones (around 16 mins) to a waiting plate (with paper towels to absorb grease) and reduced the remaining limper bacon to one pan and returned it (turned around properly) to the oven to finish (maybe 4 or 5 minutes longer). 
It was all PERFECT!

This works well with thick-sliced bacon. After it cools, I pulse it in the food processor to make bacon bits.

I let it cook longer at 350 before flipping, about 25 minutes per side to get it a little more crispy without turning up the heat and risk burning it. Love cooking it this way so it doesn't curl up on you.

Love this method. So much easier to cook for a crowd or just a large amount for the rest of the week. Thanks Barbara for a great method which will be used often in our home.

I do this all the time ! I learned this from working in a restaurant. So much easier than babysitting a frying pan on the stove. Parchment paper is a lifesaver for this and you will have no sticking and really no mess. After removing the bacon strips, let the bacon grease cool and harden a bit, then throw away.

My Mother in law always cooked her bacon this way. So this is how I cooked it when I stayed with her after we got married. Comes out nice and crispy.
