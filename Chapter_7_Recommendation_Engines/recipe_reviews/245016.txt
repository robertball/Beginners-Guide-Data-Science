These are really good! They make a healthy after school snack for kids or for anybody, for that matter. I used gloves and combined the mixture using my hands. Much easier to do that than to use a utensil to try and mix.

I didnâ€™t have have some ingredients but the recipe is forgiving. Very delicious. A nice, guilt-free snack when the kids are rummaging through the kitchen.
