I was looking for a non-mayo based pasta salad to bring to a 4th of July celebration, preferably one that contained imitation crabmeat (because I had some on hand and wanted to use it). I did an ingredient search for imitation crabmeat, with "salad" as the dish type, and this one was in the search results. I made it exactly as directed, but brought the leftover dressing along, in case people wanted to drizzle a bit more over theirs. It was well received by everyone. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Have been making this salad for years. The recipe I have adds fresh or dried dill. Over time we have added any veggie in the refrig, red kidney beans,  whatever you have works,  flexible recipe.  We love the no mayonnaise for hot days.

I made this with minor changes:  only had imitation crab legs on hand, not the chunks, so chopped them finely--added nice texture and color to the salad.  Also, had no oil and vinegar dressing on hand, so used Zesty Italian, and the flavor was great!   As I had dressed salad about 2 hours before the event we attended, I added a bit more just before serving, to "freshen" it up.  It was good, as evidenced by the empty bowl at the end of the event, and perfect for the crowd there (no great foodies or lovers of spicy foods!), but next time, when I make it for just us, I plan to "shake it up a bit" and add some more vegies, maybe nuts or dried fruit, and spice it up a bit.  But this is a great basic recipe, ideal for most buffets or picnics, and SUPER EASY to make, even last-minute!!!

This is good on a hot day, but rather bland for us. I liked the oil & vinegar  dressing, rather than mayo.
