I am a Kentuckian and have been making Henry Bain's sauce for years! Have NEVER put pickeled walnuts  in it! NEVER seen that in the reciepe! Always pur√©e the major grey chutney in a food processor prior to mixing! Otherwise the reciepe is what I follow and get raves every time! Store in a mason jar in the fridge and will last forever!

Being a Louisville native I've made it at least a dozen times as per the recipe. Great on beef tenderloin. I cut the beef in about 1/8" thick slices like silver dollars and put a stripe of it down the center on a platter.

We couldn't find the pickled walnuts, but it didn't seem to suffer.  We served it over a grilled London Broil marinated in a bourbon-brown sugar mixture.  Delicious!
