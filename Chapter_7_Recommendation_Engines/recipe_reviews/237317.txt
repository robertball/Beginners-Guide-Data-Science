Very good with great sauce! Maybe a little time-consuming but worth it! I skipped Pine Nuts and used chopped walnuts as well as currant jam instead of currants as that is what I had. Flank steak turned out tender and tasty. Thanks Chef John!

Delicious and very tender. I used toothpicks to bind the ends together and it worked well. I “enjoyed” making and eating it!
