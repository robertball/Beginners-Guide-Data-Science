The idea of using the combo of peaches and orange juice sounded good; however I'm not sure I'd care for the canned peaches, and we can get really tasty fresh peaches in the grocery store now.  So for 2 servings I used two fresh peaches (peeled), 1/2 cup 2% milk, 1/2 cup vanilla yogurt, 1/4 cup orange juice, 1 tsp sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and 4 ice cubes to lighten it up.  A 5-star smoothie.

This was satisfactory but I didn't think it was fabulous.  I would suggest adding ice and more ice cream to make it thicker and make sure it is blended well.

good, but I skipped the ice cream all together and added ice instead. About 8 cubes. Much more refreshing. :)

I think this smoothie called for a little too much milk.  I used three fresh peaches instead of a can, and I think I should have used four.  This is more of a peaches and cream milkshake, rather than a peach smoothie.

I used only 1 1/2 cups of plain soymilk (not vanilla) and three fresh peaches instead of canned.  I and my family loved this and I would definitely make it again, maybe doubling the recipe because it didn't yield as much volume as I'd expected.  Oddly, my brother thought it had a vaguely banana-y flavor.  Very creamy texture, though.

I made this with regular milk. Also, I ran out of o.j. so I used pineapple juice as well. Wonderful fruity flavor and deliciously creamy. Thanks!

Because I wanted to make it lighter, I used fat free plain yogurt instead of ice cream--about a cup. I also used nonfat milk. I did add a teaspoon of pure vanilla flavoring. Great way for me to use up a can of no-sugar-added peaches from my pantry and make a quick breakfast smoothie for the kids.

This was very very good. I used frozen peaches and 1% cows milk. My kids keep asking me to make it again and again.

A little too much orange juice in my opinion! Replaced ice cream with orange sherbert and vanilla soy milk with unsweetened almond milk, splash of vanilla.

It sounded pretty tasty, but I found it to be flavorless and not enjoyable.  2nd time I used Vanilla Soy Milk instead of regular Soy Milk, frozen peaches instead of canned (make it cold), teaspoon of fresh lemon juice, Vanilla yogurt instead of ice cream and some maple syrup. That was excellent, real tasty.

This should be called Peaches and Cream Smoothie. It reminded me so much of peaches and cream. It was fabulous!

It was OK. Use more ice cream and add ICE to make the smoothie cold.

Excellent!  Yes, it is more of a peachsicle milkshare but ohhh so good.  If you want more consistency of a smoothie may want to try adding a little ice.  I used fresh peaches (4 med size).

I am sure as a healthy smoothie this is a winner, but for me though it sounded pretty tasty, I found it to be flavorless and warm, which is not how I like my smoothies. It wasn't enjoyable. Determined to have a smoothie, I took the same concept and remade it using some Heavy Whipped Cream instead of Soy and added some berries that I happened to have around which amounted to about 1 and 1/2 cups of Blueberries and 1/2 cup of Raspberries. I then added ice and 2 tablespoons of sugar.    I do thank the author for the concept, I am always looking for new ideas!

Good taste, but not enough of it. What I'm trying to say: It did not have nearly enough flavor for my liking.
