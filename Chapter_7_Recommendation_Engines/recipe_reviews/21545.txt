It's okay, but COTTAGE CHEESE????  I knew I should have just used the ricotta, but I wanted to try it first as is.  Next time--- RICOTTA.  Now that it's so available I don't know why anyone would use cottage cheese in lasagne.

Very good.  I add one 10oz. box of frozen chopped spinach with the meat mixture for more nutrition.  Good way sneak in something green Moms.  **Tip** for all Lasagna makers - no need to wash another pot to boil noodles.  Soak raw, hard noodles in a large bowl of hot tap or boiling water for 30 min.  Then layer as usual.  Noodles won't be cooked, but will complete it's cooking in the oven.

Great tasting lasagne!  This recipe requires a little preparation, but it is certainly worth it.  I chose to use chicken instead of beef and it wasn't a problem.  Using many different cheeses makes the lasagna tick!  Perhaps adding a tad more sugar to the tomato mix would be nice, for the tomato paste is quite concentrated.  Also, I would recommend putting something (an egg, more cheese, tomato sauce, etc.) on the top layer of lasagna noodles so that they won't be burnt.  Mmmmm.  :)

I have been using this recipe since 2004 with great success.  I use Rao's marinara sauce and substitute half the cottage cheese with whole milk Ricotta.  I use oven ready lasagna noodles dipped in boiling water for a few seconds.  Finally, I use a combination of resh and regular mozzarella. Top of with marinara.  These modifications have put this very good recipe over the top.  Don't cheap out on the ingredients.

I have recieved rave reviews from friends that come and try this dish!  Some have gone as far to say it is the best lasagne they have eaten.  I really love it, but I do add one or two things from the origional recipe.  I add chopped zucchini and mushrooms to two of the layers.  I also use mozerrella more than I use parmesan cheeze.  I have found this to make it even better for me.  
Great Recipe.

This recipe was pretty amazing and is the first time I made lasagna. It turned out really well but I did not use cottage cheese. I used ricotta.  I also recommend making a little more sauce if you like it saucy! I also only had to bake mine for 45 minutes and it was ready. Any longer and it would have been really dry. I only had to use about 6 noodles so dont boil the whole box. :)

Great recipe -- gets lots of compliments. OK, I cheated and just used spaghetti sauce, but it's still great. Not over-tomatoey, like a lot lasagna. I cut recipe in half, and still need 9 lasagna noodles -- just trim them for an 7X7 square baking dish. Oh, and used ricotta too instead of cottage cheese. This is *the* keeper of lasgana recipes.

I only cook about 3 times a year and tried this recipe for my boyfriend's kids who are extremely picky. Aside from that their family is full blooded Italian and they are used to their Nannie's cooking. The kids later told their aunts it was the best lasagna ever and begged me to make it again. I replaced the cottage cheese with ricotta...and used lavender salt in the meat. I also made the meat mixture the day ahead to let all the spices come to know each other.

My husband loved this recipe and I really liked it, but I like a more "saucy" lasagne, so I tried to increase the tomato ingredients by 50%.  It didn't make it that much saucier and hubby didn't like it.  Oh well, the recipe is still really good as is!  I will definitely be making this again.

Good basic recipe; the sliced mozzarella makes a big difference.  I recommend using more of the cottage cheese mixture.  I also used 3 more noodles, 2 cans of no salt added chopped tomatoes (no puree), 1 chopped onion, 1/2 of the sugar called for, 1 tsp Italian seasoning, 1 lb sausage and 1/2 lb ground beef (instead of 1 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb sausage), 1 small can mushrooms and kosher instead of iodized salt.  My husband loved it, asked for it for lunch the next day.

Very good recipe - used turkey sausages.  As other users, used ricotta/cottage blend and remove all salt from recipe (it had enough).  Added spinach to cheese mixture and red pepper flakes to sauce mixture.  Also used 4 cheese blend instead of parmesan in cheese mixture.  Not enough sauce - next time using 1 lg. and 1 med can of crushed tomatoes instead of 1 10.75 oz. can tomato puree.
Thanks for sharing this excellent recipe!

This is the perfect lasagna. It makes a big, hearty, meaty, savory dish! It is rather time-consuming, but worth it. We froze the leftovers for future lunches. I added more herbs than the recipe called for, and I also used a full LB of sausage. I substituted a four cheese blend for the grated parm, which was a good choice as well. I always mix dried parsley into the cottage cheese mixture and large amounts of garlic powder ( this is just my preference).
Definitely recommended. Thanks for the recipe!

This lasagna recipe is the only one I make. The only change I make is reducing the amount of sugar in the sauce by half. I get complimented on this every time and the leftovers never last very long!

This is a great lasagna Kathy minus the salt. The cheeses and the sauce have plenty of it on their own. Hubby loved the fact that there was sausage mixed in with the beef. Although I love cottage cheese, I love ricotta even more, so that's what I used. I did need to add much more sauce than stated, but all in all, it was loved by the whole family. Thanks so much!

Delicious -- this will be my go-to lasagna recipe! Because I only had one 6 oz. can of tomato paste, I used 6 oz. tomato sauce as a substitute for the second, which worked out great. The meat mix was a little too thick for my liking so I added a bit more of the pureed tomato and tomato sauce with another 1/2 tsp. or so of sugar to balance out the extra tomato flavor.

Finally, a really good base recipe for homemade lasagna that my family enjoys!  I've made several and almost gave up on enjoying a good homemade lasagna.  Saw this in the Allrecipes cookbook and decided to give it a try.  Must be good if it made it into the cookbook, right?  I'm so glad I did.  I only did a few things differently, but nothing much.  I added a little extra sauce and added fresh, lightly steamed spinach.  Made homemade garlic bread with it, too.  I plan to use this recipe as a base recipe and try various things in the future.  I also plan to make a big batch of it and freeze a few pre-made ones for quick dinners later.  Freeze it before cooking in the oven.  Then cook it like you would a frozen lasagna dish from the store. Thank you, Kathy, for submitting a great lasagna recipe our family enjoys!  :)

very good and a bit different tasting due to the cottage cheese and sausage. i think i added a bit too much salt this first time though, probably because sausage tends to be salty, so keep that in mind when preparing it! i love this recipe. yum.

This was a pretty good recipe but I would increase the tomato sauce content as I found the meat mixture a little dry for my liking.  I would also take Madame D.'s advise and put something on the top to prevent the top noodles from burning.  Overall, a good and easy recipe.

Very, very tasty!  I made a few modifications and it worked out great.  I used regular uncooked lasagna noodles (a lot less work and tastes the same to me!), also I "cheated" and used a large jar of store bought spaghetti sauce, and I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  So good with the ground beef and italian sausage, my husband is still raving about it!

This was a good, basic lasagne.  We found it a little too salty, but certainly not too salty to enjoy.  My picky eater was thrilled that there were no onions or tomato chunks in it.  LOL

This is a very tasty recipe, although it was a little too dry. I would probably add extra tomatoes. Also, if you would like to save yourself extra time cooking the pasta, try using pre-cooked, ready to layer lasagne noodles. Saves alot of time.

My husband really loved the lasagna, but I have a few suggestions.  It was waaaay too salty, I would definitely eliminate some of the salt.  You will have leftover meat sauce, even using extra, so you can freeze it for spaghetti or something else.  I would add extra ricotta unless you like your lasagna not very cheesy. Also, the top layer burns a little bit, so I would maybe add some more sauce on it.  It's pretty good, but takes a long time to prepare.  The sauce is really good thoug!

If it seems like too much cottage cheese -- use the small curd variety (yes, you can see it on the label at the store).  Second -- if you want it spicier, some hot chili pepper flakes (about 1 tbsp., to taste) are good in the red sauce mixture.

Fabulous! Words can not describe how much I loved this lasagne! I added some spinach (I needed to use it up ASAP) to the ricotta mixture, and it worked out just fine. =) Will definately make this one again.

This was an AWESOME lasagne! I did make a few changes to the recipe though. Instead of using all that tomato stuff, I used a jar (750g/roughly 32oz) of tomato passata (it's the texture of paste/juice..quite runny) and a can of chopped tomatoes. I also added chopped mushrooms and sliced tomato to layers. I did the last few layers as pasta, then cheese mix, then mozzarella. I used low fat cottage cheese and reduced fat mozzarella to make it diet friendly for me. This recipe is really delicious and hearty and I will be making it at least once a week!! Thank you Donna - I have emailed it to all my family!

Excellent and easy! I used the no-bake lasagna noodles and that cut down on the prep time.  I also added extra mozzarella slices cause we like things cheesy! I used ricotta instead of the cottage cheese and it turned out great. thanks-we iwll make this again!

mmm This was really yummy.  I followed all the directions exactly as marked, even the cottage cheese, which I normally dont ever use in my lasagna.  Ive always just used mozzarella/provolone, no ricotta or cottage cheese.  I think next time I might leave it out too, just because im used to not using it, but it was excellent as it was.  One of the best lasagnas ive had. Thanks for sharing!

I've always used my own recipe for lasagne but I decided to try this one for something different.  It worked great and tasted delicious.  I served it to my entire family when I had them over for dinner and everyone had seconds (and some had thirds).

I cook at my firehouse and this was easy and got great reviews from the guys.  I did add spinach and ricotta to it and adjusted the amounts of beef and sausage to what size packages were on sale that day.  It will go into a regular rotation.

Too much of a tomato paste taste for us. Needs some spices to counteract or enhance.    Quite dry.  Needs more sauce and tomato ingredients to balance all that cheese.  I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese. Maybe cooking one hour was reason it came out too dry for our liking. Will continue to look around for different lasagna recipes.

This was so good! I used ground turkey instead of meat, and substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese. I served with olives, roasted red bell peppers, and roasted garlic w/ bread for my boyfriend's birthday, and he was a very, happy camper!

Excellent flavor,texture,and appearance! For some unknown reason i could not find tomato puree so i used tomato sauce this was the only change I made to this recipe. Very meaty and cheesy not alot of soupy sauce which was exactly what my family was looking for.

Great classic lasagne. I used more ricotta (went for the 32 oz. container) and made bit more of that great meat sauce. Worth the trouble. Way better than even the best frozen lasagne.

I have made this lasagna at least a dozen times now, usually for some sort of family get-together, and it is AMAZING with just a few changes... always use ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese (4 cups, not 3)!! I can't stress this enough. The texture and flavor is just so much better! And, go ahead and use a full pound each of beef and sausage. Sure it gets big and messy (just put a cookie sheet under your baking dish in the oven to catch stuff), but it also gets delicious. And, don't be shy with your red sauce. I tend to use Ragu traditional because it doesn't have a lot of overpowering herbs so you can taste the herbs you put in the cheese mixture and you can really taste that yummy sausage. Get one of the big jars. Add extra Ragu to your meat sauce to make it nice and creamy, especially since you're using extra sausage. Put a little Ragu on the bottom of the pan before you start layering so your noodles don't stick, then make sure you've got plenty of cheese on top so it browns really nicely. I use about 24 ounces of shredded mozzarella instead of 16 ounces of slices. Yeah, it's bad for you. It's meaty, cheesy lasagna, so what? Lastly, serve some extra Ragu alongside the lasagna so people can smother it (and don't forget the shredded Parmesan). Everyone I've ever served it to just loves it and always asks for it again when I'm hosting! Yum!
