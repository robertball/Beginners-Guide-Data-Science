I wish more folks would submit recipes from their Grandmothers...I find those recipes to be the best...the older..the better. I love trying old tried and true recipes from different countries. This was good. To the cook who tried to use the Panko, Panko is a very delicate bread crumb, much different than Matzo in consistency.  Whenever you use Panko, always use tempura batter with it. Please do not give negative comments if you don't follow the recipe the way the original cook intended it. Thanks for the recipe, my 4 year old loved it.

I've had this many many times, and it's great every time.  The key is to not try to cook the chicken too fast, or it will turn brown on the outside and not done inside.

When I fry things like this, I ALWAYS use half olive oil and half butter. One brings down the temperature of the other which gives you more control... and great taste.

Great recipe.  The trick to not having the breading fall off is to double dip -- egg, then matzo meal, then egg, then matzo meal again.  If you fry at the correct temp, this absorbs very little grease.

Not a favorite but I might repeat - it's just that there's so many things to try that I often don't repeat even the ones I really liked.

I add lemon juice to the egg mixture.  Also, rather than frying, I spray the cutlets with a canola oil spray and bake at 425 until done (I put on a rack so the underside gets crispy, too).  It's not quite the same as frying, but it's a healthier alternative.

My 15 year old daughter chose this recipe for her night to cook and I was a little leary of her trying it, but she did awesome and the chicken was really good. I'd like to put a bit more spice into it next time we cook it, or maybe marinade the chicken first..just to add some flavor. The only down side I see to this recipe ..is that it's deep fried food. It was a definate confidence booster for my daughter.

Excellent flavor. I often have trouble getting coatings to stick, but this one worked great.

I liked the seaoning, but prefer using a generous tablespoon of poultry seasoning instead of the mustard, sea salt and pepper, and a 1/4 cup of potato starch mixed in with the matzo meal.  The potato starch helps make it nice and crisp.  I also combine olive and vegetable oil for cooking.

I made this with breast tenders for an all woman's lunch yesterday and served it over lettuce and tomatoes.  I was planning on taking some home to my DH but not a single piece was left.  will have to make more.

I can't imagine why someone thought this was bland.  Did you follow the recipe? Although I try not to fry anything, it IS the best tasting. I love the mustard and paprika in it.  t was so good I will have to make it again next weekend. And maybe try to bake it instead to see if it turns out similar.  Oh and make sure you evenly coat the chicken with the matzo, or else it just won't stay completely on like the poster says.

This is a great easy recipe that deserves a five, but I have to give it a four because it did not have a taste to me...did anyone else encounter that.  How can I make it have a taste.  to further explain it was like a bland breaded coating.

Did my Passover meal and choose this recipe. This was exceptionally good. I will probably be making it again. I did substitute Spanish Paprika for Hungarian Paprika because that is what I had on hand. Keep a close eye while cooking so it doesn't burn.

Wow!  Such flavor for a Jewish recipe!  My family gobbled it down, fighting over pieces!  I had to cook the chicken longer than specified, but so juicy and flavorful.  Great addition to our Passover recipe collection.

Excellent!  Made this tonight for supper and because it’s Passover I used matzo meal but will try using regular bread crumbs during the year even though it’s really tasty with the matzo meal.  Followed the recipe as written and it produced an amazingly crispy crust....yummmm
