The taste is just OK, but it is not easy & quick to make. Time is needed to hammer and flatten chicken breast.  Then wrapping pork fillings with the chicken is tedious too (maybe I do not have the skill & talent).  I don't think I'll have time to make it again.

Although they're not a snap to make, these chicken breasts are a nice change from ordinary chicken breast dishes.  I think next time I will try tying them together with kitchen string instead of using toothpicks -- might help them stay together better.  All in all, it makes really nice "fancy" chicken dish.  Be sure to get them nice and browned on the outside to assure that the inner chicken meat is fully cooked...I had to nuke mine an extra minute after cutting it open to find slightly raw chicken inside.

A lot of the time, it's the side dishes that make the meal. This is one of those times. Chicken breast stuffed with rosemary-scented pork is very nice, but it needs something to really make it shine. A nice sauce would really help here, since chicken can be dry. I tried it with a garlic-and-lemony veloute and was satisfied, but a creative cook could do more with saucing this dish. Serve it with an earthy mushroom risoto and green beans or asparagus stir-fried with oregano (or marjoram, if your tastes are more subtle).

A lot of work for mediocrity.  It sounds so good and worth the effort but it's just bleh and you finish the meal wondering what all the fuss was about....won't be making this one again...
