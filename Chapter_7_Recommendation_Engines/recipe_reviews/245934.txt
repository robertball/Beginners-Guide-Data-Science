I used half the brown sugar since the bananas add sweetness. Very good for Christmas breakfast!

I halved this recipe when I made it. The French toast bake part of this recipe was fabulous. But the banana foster portion was SO SWEET. I could barely stomach it as breakfast. I do plan on making it again but cutting back on the sweetness.

This was very good but it could have used a little more egg mixture for me.
