This is an adult chocolate lover's dream!! It really should not be wasted on children. Give them a pudding snack and they'll be just as happy...this is for the Mommas and the Daddies. I've made this many times with different variations on the same theme and was only disappointed once...when the dogs got into it first.:( I've added walnuts used Chocolate Wafer Cookies instead of ladyfingers used a spring form pan...which give it an 'ooohh lala' appearance made two layers to give it a more interesting texture (something you can sink your teeth into) and topped it with fresh whip cream and fruit or chocolate shavings. And semi-sweet chocolate chips work great...and easy to find. My favorite is all of them together. I am not a lover of cooking but this is one of my guilty pleasures. This is as good as anything you can get in a restaurant!!

This recipe is AMAZING! I live overseas and couldn't find ladyfingers so I used nilla wafers and layered it in a spring form pan. I also sliced strawberries and put them on top. Everyone I serve it to wants the recipe.

Yum! This worked out excellent! Solved my chocolate need for the next couple of days. This one is a keeper and I'm afraid I'll be making it quite often!

I was really torn between giving this four or five stars... It was really good and easy to make (I did make a couple changes to the assembly I made it in a springform pan with the ladyfingers arranged along the edge and added a oreo crumb crust). I also used terry's chocolate orange for the chocolate which added an amazing flavour! I suppose the reason I was hesitant to give a five was that although I liked it how I made it I think it would be a four without the crumb crust...

This is very good. Not a quick recipe to make though. The assembling is a little bit tricky. We actually got it wrong and then thought we made it wrong. We only were able to fill one loaf pan about half full with chocolate and then we noticed we cut the lady finger the wrong way. I assume it's supposed to be a very thin dessert. Everyone did love it and the choc. filling has a good flavor.

It seems unfair if I rated this recipe 4 stars because I didn't follow it to the letter. I prefer oreo crust rather than ladyfingers. I used ordinary dark chocolate that contains 62% cocoa for more bitterness. I found it a bit too sweet for me so next time I will add a bit more of whipped cream (300 ml). But overall I have to say this cake is perfect when I crave for a chocolate treat. It's light fluffy bitter and sweet. Oooh yum!

This is very similar to a dessert my mom used to make. So this is "comfort" food for me! A couple of things: (1) I like the chocolate cookie crumb crust better than ladyfingers but i guess that's personal preference (my mom used to make it in a piecrust so that' another option) and (2) be very careful with the eggs since this is not cooked. In the old days raw eggs were not an issue but these days it is health risk so only use eggs that you are very sure of. It is a delicious and pretty easy recipe that I've never tired of.

A delicious dessert. I used chocolate wafers for the crust since we don't have ladyfingers here - it was a bit dry but it worked. Do not mix water into the chocolate; it doesn't melt smoothly with water mixed in. The kids loved this.

The picture shows something other than ladyfingers on the bottom since ladyfingers aren't dark brown. Why not either make the actual recipe and photograph that or give the recipe that matches the photograph?
