I took the advice from others' comments and they turned out fantastic.  Adjustments were 1/4  cup oil, 1+1/4 applesauce....plus additional 1/2 tsp nutmeg, cinnamon, and baking powder.

Finally, a cranberry muffin recipe I like! My modifications were: 1 1/4 cup applesauce, 1/4 cup oil, brown sugar instead of white, used half wholewheat flour, and added 1/2 tsp baking soda. Baked about 20 mins. They are great! Very moist, nice light texture. I might add more cinnamon next time.

I was extremely pleased with the way these came out, especially since the recipe is so simple!  I used half a cup of dried cranberries, and my pecans had mysteriously turned into walnuts, so I didn't make the recipe precisely as stated, but the texture and flavour were great!  I definitely agree that this is a fantastic basic 'sweet muffin' recipe, and it will probably become my base recipe for future variations.

I really enjoyed these muffins. I did change a few things. Sweetened applesauce was used. Butter was used instead of vegetable oil. I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Also, I used frozen cranberries. I was really pleased with the final product. I will make these muffins again.

I doubled the recipe and used a full can of full berry cranberry sauce (they were on sale and I was looking for something to use them in) Turned out great, very moist and tasty. I also added 1 teaspoon of baking poweder for leavening.

These were pretty good.  I was pleased with the texture of muffins made with more applesauce than oil, since applesauce usually changes the texture to more spongy.  I don't usually go more than 50/50 applesauce/oil (or butter), when trying to lower fat in recipes, but this recipe was a pleasant surprise in that area.  That said, I did feel that the cranberries (fresh) tartness was very strong for this muffin, so I would suggest (& I'll try this next time I make them) is either using dried, or tossing your fresh berries w/ a bit of stevia/sugar/whatever sweetener you use, and letting that sit while you prep the rest of the batter.  That should bring out the sweetness a bit more.  I also think next time I'd add and extract (like orange/vanilla).  I also used part white whole wheat flour in this recipe with no problems in texture/taste.

The cranberry applesauce muffins are great!  I changed the recipe just a tad.  I have co-workers that include myself that are trying to lose weight, so instead of the sugar, I substituted Splenda.  They turned out wonderful.

This recipe was perfect for what I wanted them for! I love using applesauce in recipes. I used egg replacer istead of egg to make them vegan, and dehydrated cranberries instead of frozen. I think that the frozen would definitely be preferred, as the ones I used did not make the muffins very tart at all. Which was kind of sad!

These muffins baked very nicely.  They are nice and big and delicious.  I don't actually have kids, but I'm guessing they'd like them.  I didn't have any cranberries on hand, so I made the muffins without them.  I'll try adding them next time...they can only make them better!

These turned out so wonderful--moist and flavorful to the nth degree! I used whole wheat white flour and added a teaspoon of baking powder. I used my own homemade organic applesauce. I did a coarse chop on the cranberries for this in my small food processor which made the process a little easier. I think next time I make these, I'll cut back a little on the oil and add more applesauce (just to cut back on the fat just a bit) but they are very tasty as is. The combination of applesauce, cranberries and pecans is so good! EDITED: Twelve regular muffins and 12 mini's gone by the end of the day. I'd say we liked these! ;) NOTE: I got 12 largeish regular muffins out of this and 12 mini-muffins. 350 degrees for 20 minutes for the regular muffins and 12 minutes for the mini-muffins was just right.

Very good, specially when you need a quick bite before you busily head out the door!! I used dried cranberries, nice combination with the pecans.  I will make these again!

Easy and good.  I used the suggestions to increase the applesauce and decrease the oil.  Worked well.

Excellent muffins. I made a few modifications for my taste. I used one cup whole wheat flour and one cup of quick cooking oatmeal instead of white flour. I used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup splenda. I used walnuts rather than pecans and added approximately 1 tsp of fresh lemon zest. I also topped with a sprinkle of quick cooking oatmeal prior to baking. Baked for 25 min. Came out perfect and very tasty. Thanks for the base recipe.

moist and fluffy muffins  I doubled the recipe and these were great. I used 2 full 15oz cans of applesauce, 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugars and added 2 tsp baking powder. You need the baking powder for the rise. I used crasins and almonds since thats what I had in the house made these at 4am and they were gone by 8 am lol

Good recipe.  I added 1 T. of vanilla and next time, I'll toss the cranberries in 2 T. of sugar before adding them...  They were a little tart for our taste!

I really enjoyed these muffins!  I usually find muffins too sweet and these are just perfect.  If you prefer a sweeter muffin, you may want to add raw sugar to the muffin tops or more sugar to the recipe itself.

I used walnuts instead of pecans as that's what I had on hand.  To my horror, I discovered that I was out of baking soda, so I substituted 2 tsp baking powder.

So easy and delicious! I added cinnamon and nutmeg, and topped each muffin with about 1/8 tsp of a cinnamon/nutmeg/sugar mixture to balance the tart cranberries. Yum!

I was expecting these to be a lot sweeter than they were.  The cranberries were so tart and even the dough part isn't sweet.  They made my mouth pucker everytime I took a bite.  I won't be making these again.  For anyone trying these, substitute sweetened applesauce and sweetened cranberries, if possible.

Ok, but I followed the other reviewers advice and added more oil and substituted half wheat flour and brown sugar.  I also used dehydrated cranberries so I added a tad bit of water.  However, the sugar needed to be about double (would be my guess) as it was very a little on the bland and boring side.  Would make again w/ the extra sugar.

Great recipe!  I had to add a some milk and extra oil because my batter turned out a little thick.  Possibly because I used homemade applesauce that didn't have enough liquid to it.  I also used dried cranberries instead of fresh/frozen.  I think they had the perfect amount of sweetness.  If you have a sweet tooth you could add icing to the top, but I had mine with butter and they were delicious!

Chewy, cinnamon goodness in a healthy little muffin! Used 1/2 tsp more cinnamon but I could barely taste the applesauce so will use more next time in place of oil. Don't be fooled by the dense batter--muffins rise up wonderfully with the extra 1/2 tsp baking powder.  Also used Craisins instead of cranberries

Nice and simple recipe. I did the changes suggested and added 1 1/4 c applesauce and 1/4 c oil. The only problem with this is that the muffin sticks to the paperliners because of the lack of oil.  I also added 3/4 tsp cardamon for some extra spice and about 2 c cranberries because I needed to use them up.

These are awesome yummy! I took some other reviewers advise: Added 1 t. orange flavoring; Added a bit more oil; Brushed with butter and dipped in raw sugar after baking.   Very good, and I doubled the recipe.

I love these muffins, I make 'em all winter...here's a tip to make things go faster....I use  2 cups of Jiffy baking mix, and omit the salt and baking soda. Use dried cranberries, you can always have them on hand, add a teaspoon or so of veg. oil for moistness.

These turned out very nicely.  I left out the nuts, and substituted finely ground wheat flour for the all-purpose.  Overall these were a little more tart than I would have liked, but still very delicious.

Not sure what all the raving is about. These needed double the amount of sugar. They were VERY bland! I'm not looking for a cake, but they definately need to be a little sweeter in order to be like a muffin. Bread is sweeter than these were. I'll keep looking

Very dense with little rise. This recipe seems to have potential, though. I added the extra baking soda suggested and also maple flavoring. Plus, I used butter instead of oil. The batter is very thick, so I would probably add 1/2 C butter, hoping to get better texture. All this said, it seems pretty healthful, and I am sure my kids will like them!

I followed the suggestions of adding 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, and the muffins rose wonderfully. The texture is great, nice and moist, but the flavor is sort of blah. I even used fresh cranberries. Next time I think I'll try adding more salt and maybe some vanilla or brown sugar.

I thought these were some really tasty muffins!  I did add 1/2 tsp. baking powder, but other than that, kept everything else the same.  Used fresh cranberries and they came out so moist!  Great!

These rise nicely--very high--and are light rather than dense. I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice (about 1/2 t. each), and I think they taste good.

If you love cranberry these are awesome.  Cranberry Nut Muffins are my husband's favorite, so I decided to give these a try. He was thrilled and I certainly was not disappointed.  They would be perfect for holidays.

I really like these muffins.  Not too sweet.  I soaked dried cranberries in hot water before making as I did not have any fresh or frozen.  Dust with a little powdered sugar if you want to doll them up for a brunch.  Should freeze well.

These were great, and are easy to change up with different fruits/nuts. I decreased the calorie and fat content further by using 1 and 1/2 cups of applesauce, no oil, and 1/2 Splenda for baking instead of sugar. They were slightly more dense than they would have been with the oil, but a good trade off for the calories. Making strawberry pecan ones this afternoon!

These were ok. I would want to rate it 3 stars for taste - but gave it 4 stars for the ease of using applesauce and not having to peel-core-chop any apples. I reduced the oil and sugar a bit and found these tasted a little bit too salty. Would use half the amount of salt if i make these again. I prefer "Easy Apple Cinnamon Muffins" from this site - but it calls for more effort with the apples in that recipe.

The dough was heavy and the muffins did not rise. The outcome was a tart and very dense muffin that did not taste very good. I'll certainly use another recipe next time.

These are fantastic. Unfortunatly I cant find either fresh or frozen cranberries at this time of year so I used a frozen mixed berry mix with raspberries, blueberries, strawberries and blackberries. I used half light brown sugar and half with. All I had was cinnamon applesauce so I just used it instead of plain and I did keep the added cinnamon in the batch because in my house we love cinnamon. These were dense which I know is from the applesause but very good. I cant wait to try them with fresh cranberries.

WOW.  These muffins are great!  I used Craisins and Walnuts as substitutes (didn't have fresh cranberries or pecans) and they were still SO good.  We'll definitely make them again the same way.

These came out perfect for me.  Very delicious.  I followed the advice of others and used 1 1/4 c. applesauce but used the full 1/3 c. oil.  I also added 1/2 c. finely chopped dried cranberries instead of fresh.  (Since I don't care for the texture of nuts in my muffins but like the flavor of the nuts I also added 1/4 very finely ground walnuts.)

These are delicious!  I used 1/2 cup dried cranberries since they are not in season right now.  I also followed suit of other reviewers and used 1 1/4 cup applesauce, 1/4 cup oil (I used olive) and 1 1/2 tsp  baking soda.  I made them mini muffins and they were great!

I have not made these yet but they sound really good! I can't wait to make them. As for the previous reviewer, my reveiw of your comment is who cares if people spell definitely wrong?? I thought your comment was mean. And as I looked back on the reviews of this recipe, many people used the word definitely, but ONLY one person spelled it wrong. I do think you should chill out...life is short!

Read the reviews and decided to try these using what changes others had recommended.  They were okay, but really didn't have a lot of flavour.  I used fresh cranberries and increased the cinnamon and added nutmeg, but still something was missing.

Really good!!! Moist, tart (I used fresh cranberries), with some crunch (I used walnuts). Did everything as the recipe says. But I also topped the muffins with 1T cane sugar + 1T ground flax before putting them into the oven for 28 minutes. They looked like from a bakery, really fancy! Loved it, saved to my recipe box, will definitely make them again.

This recipie was awesome great as a meal with fruit or a quick snack! I added 1/2 tsp of baking powder, I just wasn't sure how the muffins would rise. They turned out perfectly! Even my almost 3yr old gobbled them up. These will be perfect to bring to holiday parties and gatherings.

I had some extra fresh cranberries I needed to use up so I decided to try this recipe since my kids love muffins. It's definitely different, the batter was sticky and stuck to the liners even after they cooled. They are not a sweet muffin but they are ok. My ten year old liked them but she's the only one.

TYFTI (!) I thought these were lovely.  My only problem was using (I halved recipe) "1/2 cup cranberries, chopped" and not "1/2 cup chopped cranberries".  In other words, I measured out a half a cup of cranberries and then chopped them (yielding me about 1/4 cup).  Not enough of that wonderful cranberry kick I was so looking forward to.  Note to self:  add a bit of orange extract and baking powder, oven to 425 and when ready to bake drop to 375 for 18".  Perfectly cooked - nice and light with good texture.

We made as directed except we used some pomegranate seeds that we had on hand. I do agree that a little bit of nutmeg would have helped. I did decrease the baking time a bit too. We'll definitely be making these again with cranberries or any other fruit!

I just didn't like these very much.  I love cranberry muffins, this recipe has a totally different texture and taste than the other cranberry muffin recipe I use.

These are soooo good!  I used 1 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil.  I also substituted half of the flour with whole wheat flour.  Yum!  The kids loved them too!

I used blueberries and cranberries - mostly whole wheat flour and a bit extra baking soda.  They are great but missing something - maybe I added too much whole wheat flour - so I dipped the cooled muffins into lemon juice and then into sugar....now they are marvelously sweet and perfect.

The muffins are great.  I used what I had on hand using homemade whole berry cranberry sauce and applesauce and using walnuts.  Everything else is the same. Might add vanilla next time just to try it.  Yummy for breakfast or anytime.

My family loved these muffins. I made a couple of changes: I substituted canned whole cranberries for the oil and instead of the nuts I added chocolate chips.  It had a wonderful texture and the chocolate mixed with the cranberries tasted yummy.

These are good.  Don't really need anything changed or added.  That said, I used dried cranberries and tossed in coconut.  I used the coconut only because I needed to put it in something, and these sounded good.  I really like them.  Thanks!

These were really great.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1 cup of dried cranberries and left out the nuts b/c I didn't have any on hand.  They came out perfectly and not super sweet.  I will definitely be making these again.  Oh and for my oven the 25 minutes was just right.

This is very bland for a muffin and it didn't rise. I even tried recommendations from other viewers with the 2nd batch.  Liked the healthy concept but just isn't good enough.

Made these for my moms group, all the babies loved them. (I left out the nuts and used rasins instead of cranberries.) I also used whole wheat flour to make them all little healthier. All the moms wanted the recipe!

I think these need a little more sugar with the tartness of the cranberries, but my Mom thought they were perfect! The muffins are delicious and will be great with some honey or jelly. I think I'll take a note from jungle jean's suggestion of blueberries and add them with the cranberries next time. I used Holiday Cranberry Applesauce from this site; it includes red hot candies in the ingredients, and it made the muffins a little pink! I left out the nuts. Great recipe, and one I will definitely try again.

I followed the recipe as stated.  These muffins are horrible.  Cranberries are far too bitter for this base.  Blueberries would have been a better choice.  I didn't like, my husband didn't like and neither did my son.  Substitute the cranberries for a sweeter berry and you'll have a good muffin.

I thought these were very good with the changes I made.  I used homemade applesuace and about 2/3 can cranberry sauce with a hand full of dried cranberries.  I also used half whole wheat flour and half bread flour.  I didn't use any sugar because the applesauce was very sweet.  These came out very moist and light.  I will diffently make these again.

This has become my favourite muffin recipe! I love the dense texture - great for a mini meal on a long hike. I increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp and use half white flour, half multi-grain for a healthy alternative.

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great.  My only suggestion is that if you have a convection oven as I do, you may want to bake them at a lower degree oven and lesser time.  I also like the fact that it used little oil and sugar compared to other muffin type recipes.  Thank you.

My husband liked these but I was not a big fan.  I guess I don't like the texture that applesauce brings to baked goods.  I also did not taste the cranberries as much as I would like when I ate these.

I made this recipe as mini muffins.  It makes 32 mini muffins and needs to be baked for 13 minutes.  I thought this recipe needed something.  For the second batch that I baked, I added a somewhat generous amount of Baker's Sugar (very fine) to the muffin tops before I baked them which helped.

I have been looking for a healthy different muffin that did not use a cup of sugar. So happy to find this one. My family loves it. I make a double batch and then freeze them. Warm homemade muffins whenever I want. I did cut back on the oil to 1/4 cut and increased the applesauce to compensate and used brown sugar instead of white. I also increased the cinnamon to 2 tsp instead of one. My next change is to toast the pecans first. That would be very yummy. So happy I found a delicious low sugar, low fat muffin recipe!

I thought these were very good.  I made the recipe as written, and the batter was too thick to pour into the muffin cups.  I added about 1 cup of water towards the end, and they turned out perfectly.  I got 24 muffins.

Easy and good.  I used dried cranberries since I always have them in my pantry but otherwise no subs.  This is 6 point on the Weight Watchers Plus program but you can omit the nuts and drop it to 5. Love them!

This recipe was great! I didn't have any nuts on hand so I just went without them. It was still great! Next time, I'll use a little less sugar to bring out the sourness of the cranberries, one of my favorite flavors.

These really are excellent. I made the modifications others have suggested, using a bit more applesauce and less oil. I increased the cinnamon by half and added some freshly ground nutmeg. I also added a half-teaspoon of baking powder to the baking soda. I made these in mini-muffin pans, baking for about 19 minutes.

I did not flour the pans as the recipe indicated. Just greasing them was fine, and they came out beautifully. I also left out the nuts, just my preference.

I did as other reviewers recommended and increased the applesauce and reduced the oil.  They're not too sweet but they're still good.

I made a cranberry loaf instead of muffins.  It was perfect.  Much prefer using applesauce to lessen amount of sugar in baking.  It also gives a moist texture.

Yum! I had an extra can of cranberry sauce from Thanksgiving that I wanted to use up, so I substituted it into this recipe. I used it in place of the applesauce, cranberries, and pecans, and these muffins were a hit! That was the only change that I made and my kids ate the entire batch in no time (my poor husband didn't even get one). I will defiantly be making these again!

Very dense and not sweet despite tossing cranberries in sugar and sitting awhile and using regular applesauce. Not worth my calories. :(

These were great! I had chopped walnuts so I used them. Also
used 1.25 cups unsweetened applesauce and 1/4 cup vegetable oil. Added both baking sold and baking powder and 1/4 tsp. of vanilla extract. Definitely would make these again.

This was a very easy recipe that is also tasty! I did change one thing. Instead of 1/3 cup of white sugar, I filled the measuring cup halfway with white sugar and the rest brown sugar. Brought them to a brunch and they were gone! I will make these again!

Loved it! I doubled the recipe, and it made 92 mini muffins. I skipped the cranberries and pecans, as I didn’t have any, and they turned out perfectly! They took about 12 minutes.

This is DEFINITELY a keeper!  I followed the suggestions of a few other reviews with slight modifications: 1/4 cup oil, 1-1/4 cup applesauce, substituted brown sugar for white sugar, added 1/2 t baking powder, 1 t vanilla.  I used homemade applesauce which already had cinnamon in it so I didn't add any additional.  I also had some almond flour that I wanted to "get rid of" so I substituted 1/4 cup of that versus regular white all purpose flour.  (What can I say - being health conscious is overrated!) I didn't have fresh or frozen cranberries so I used Craisins - which are a slightly sweeter.  I was a bit concerned that using those would make the muffins too sweet, so after they had cooled a somewhat, I dipped each one in an orange glaze.  They were DELICIOUS!  Very moist without being overly heavy.  My husband can be a bit of a food critic & he gave it 5 stars too.  Without a doubt this will become one of my "go to" recipes!  Thank you for sharing!!

I took out the oil and just added more applesauce

I replaced white sugar with brown 

After they came out of the oven I dressed a muffin up with honey ?? ?? Would go well with cherry, rose, green tea.

Along with the applesauce, I added a can of cherry pie filling, 1teaspoon almond abstract and a teaspoon of nutmeg along with the cinnamon... I also upped the flour by a half cup, otherwise I kept the other ingredients at the same amount. Baked at 350 for 28min..My version made 24 muffins. They were absolutely wonderful. This is a great, flexible recipe. Cant wait to try it as the original version..
Thank you for this !!!

I made these today with left over fresh cranberries. The flavor is really good but they are the ugliest muffin I've ever made. With that said it's my fault the color is off. I processed my cranberries in the food processor and had to let them set a bit before I added them to the  batter. I should not have added the juice that had collected. This made the color way different, but the flavor is spot on. I made the recipe as directed except I added a small amount of tangerine essential oil. They are so good! Will make this recipe again!

First, I have to say that I am on a low-glycemic diet, so I have not tasted these muffins.  I love to bake, so I make for my brother to take into his work.  That being said, they loved these muffins.

My changes:  I had sweetened applesauce, so that is what I used.  This may have helped in regards to the many reviews that I read where they thought that the muffins were not sweet enough.  I used WalGreen's Delish Almond, Berry & Pistachio mix in place of the cranberries and pecans.  I did add some more dried cranberries to the mix.  In all, it was the 1.5 cups of fruit and nuts in the original recipe.  The last change was to add a few white chocolate chips.  Again, this was mostly to sweeten them.

I got 12 regular sized muffins.  There was a lot more batter left when I used the "fill 2/3" guidance from the recipe.  I filled the muffin cups with the remaining batter.  They did not overflow the cups when they baked.  If I had only filled 2/3 full, the muffins would not have risen to the top of the paper cups when baked.

I made this with a homemade applesauce, which contained Granny Smiths, lemon zest, orange zest, orange juice, nutmeg and cinnamon. It turned out very thick so I added a cup of plain yogurt to the mix. I did not use cranberries, deferring to my husband's taste. I used chopped pecans and half white/half whole wheat flour. I added a tsp of baking powder.  These turned very tasty. I think the addition of cinnamon and nutmeg adds to the recipe. I also sprinkled a cinnamon sugar mix over the top before baking. I baked them at 400 degrees. This turned out to be a meld of this recipe and one I have used in the past.

Great muffin.  I used melted coconut oil, and 1/4C white sugar and 1/4C honey.

My husband and I really wanted these muffins to be delicious, but were disappointed. The muffins taste and texture were very similar to bran muffins.  

This recipe was followed exactly as written, they were made on the assumption that they were a big hit based on the rating of 4 stars.  I wish that I had read the reviews beforehand so adjustments could have been made.

Marked in my files- All time favorite!!

Cranberries are plentiful for us, and these are just wonderful. No changes, no suggestions, just enjoy. Great holiday offering.

Great muffin. After Thanksgiving we had a bag of cranberries leftover. In my search to find something to use them with, I came across your recipe for Cranberry Applesauce Muffins. These muffins have the right balance of moisture and a bread like texture. Thank you.

They were incredible. The only thing I did differently was I used fresh whole cranberries and rolled them in granulated sugar before adding them to the batter. They're gone now...

Update - have also now made this as a loaf. Took a long time to bake (1+ HR) but come out delicious.

I made several changes based on other reviewers (such as LML3), so it's difficult to rate this recipe (as I don't know how the original would have turned out).
As LML3 suggested, I used only 1/4 cup of oil, 1 1/4 cups of Apple sauce (I used unsweet as the recipe indicates, though sweetened would probably be better), 1 1/2 tsp baking soda (LML3 just said they added 1/2 tsp, so I assumed that meant in addition to the 1 tsp the recipe calls for) and I substituted the white sugar for brown. I did not use half wholewheat flour, since I only have regular all purpose flour. I noticed LML3 said they would try these muffins with more cinnamon next time, so I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon (1 1/4 tsp all together).
I used fresh cranberries, leaving the smaller ones whole and halving the larger ones. I was a little concerned that the whole cranberries might still be a little firm after baking, but they were nice and soft! Also, I had the cranberries sitting in a bowl of sugar water for at least an hour  (stirring occasionally), but I don't know how much it lessened their tartness, if at all (I diluted 1 tbsp of white sugar into 1 cup of water).

Changes I would make: I would halve or quarter all of the cranberries. I would put more sugar in the sugar water (maybe 1/4 cup sugar to 1 cup water?). Also, I would probably add another fruit...blueberries or shredded/ribboned apples.  Might need to reduce the amount of cranberries to 1/2 or 3/4 cup if adding other fruit.

Did change it with 2/3 c  brown sugar and 2 cups of applesauce and used dried cranberries and walnuts. Moist and perfect sweetness for our family.

These are very good muffins. Not very sweet but I love the tang of the fresh cranberries in these and would never replace them with dried. I sometimes add brown sugar instead of white and this last time I made them I dipped them in melted butter and then into a bowl of cinnamon sugar to up the sweetness. That did the trick and made them so much tastier- and they kind of sparkled. I will always make them this way from now on. These muffins rise really well- nice and round like bakery muffins.

When I made these, I made a double batch (to use the full can of applesauce that I had).  It was REALLY thick - more like dough than batter - and knowing what I had in the house, I added a half-cup of orange juice to the recipe for a little extra flavor and to thin out the mix, and they are PERFECT!

Made it gluten free with following changes: subbed 2 C Namaste GF flour, 1 1/4 C applesauce, 1/4 C melted butter for oil, added 1/2 tsp baking powder, 3/4 C sugar and 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon. Did not add cranberries as I just wanted a GF applesauce muffin.

I made a few alterations---the 1/4 c oil, 1 1/4 c applesauce, extra spices, but I used raisins instead of cranberries.  Yummy!

Just made these muffins. They turned out great. Had to add a little milk. I didn't have any nuts to add but they tasted fine without.

I apologize for making a few changes without actually trying it unchanged --  I followed some of the other reviewers' advice and added an extra 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1 tsp vanilla, and used 1 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil.  That said, these muffins were to die for!  I ate two of them when they had barely begun to cool off, and it required major self control to keep from eating more.  Delicious!  I'm taking the rest to the office in the morning.

We've tried this recipe twice now and just can't make it work.  The dough is too dry, so I added more applesauce but they still end up very dense and dry.  We used frozen blueberries the first time and dried cranberries the second time.  Each time we used sweetened applesauce so eliminated the sugar.  They were sweet enough but just too dense. Not a nice texture.

Good basic recipe - not quite sweet enough for my tastes (and I used sweetened applesauce). Next time I'd either add more sugar or dust the top with course sugar. Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter.

Followed the recipe plus made the adjustments that others suggested 1/4 cup oil, 1+1/4 applesauce plus additional 1/2 tsp nutmeg, cinnamon, and baking powder.  They came out doughy, tasteless and VERY tart.  The 1/2 cup sugar wasn't enough.

I left out the nuts and cranberries and my family really liked them.  They weren't my absolute favorite, but I did like them, and they were super fast and easy to throw together.
