I make this all the times and my family really loves it. I saute garlic and onions along with my chicken thin I put in some fresh broccoli, slice carrot, mushroom, and then I cook it very slow and some times I might have to add a little water to thin it out.

I like this recipe. It's quick, simple and I always have the ingredients on hand. I like to add a little Italian herbs, salt & pepper to the chicken. Is a good dish when you want something mild & good for busy Moms. You can even cheat and use 1/2 tsp garlic powder if your in a hurry. ;) I know it's "scampi" but tastes good with plain old white rice too.

We added a little extra lemon juice, but it was fantastic, our kids are picky but they definitely went for seconds on this!

I was surprised at how easy and fast this was!  I ended adding more water and additional lemon juice, because the sauce got too thick.  Next time I'll double the sauce.  My picky children liked it.

I was really disappointed in this one...after all these good reviews, I was surprised to find it just tasted like condensed chicken soup on top of chicken. Edible, but I wouldn't make it again.

I didn't make this with pasta, but a barley dish. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken and lime juice instead of lemon. It was very good and even the kids liked it. My trick is that I brown the garlic separately and only add it at the end, so it keeps its flavor.

All really enjoyed the Chicken Scampi, but to be honest we made it into leftover Turkey Scampi. I put in enough turkey pieces for 4 servings and then prepared it as stated. I didn't have to cook it as long because the Turkey was already cooked. Since I didn't have to brown the chicken breasts, I also omitted the butter and fat free Cream of Chicken. I was wanting some color because it is all just a beige, so I added some chopped parsley and a small amount of green and red pepper. Just needed color. It is yummy and you'll se it on out table quite often.

This recipe is probably misnamed unless I'm misinformed about what scampi is, but whatever the case, it is a good solid very basic recipe for chicken.  As written it is more child-friendly because adults would probably like a little more flavor.  But isn't that the beauty of a recipe like this?  It can be changed up in a variety of ways! For me the next time I'd add white wine rather than water and some herbs.  When I made the pasta, I added more garlic, butter, and parmesan cheese.  Thanks for a good meal.

I cut up the chicken into bite-size pieces, added Italian seasonings, lemon pepper, and cooked in slow cooker for 3 hours. Topped with a squeeze of lemon and grating of Parmesan cheese.

I followed the recipe except I used chicken breast tenders. I put the chicken on a bed of angel hair pasta that I had seasoned with melted butter and italian seasoning. The dish was very good and got rave reviews by my family and my mom in law even loved it! I will definitely be serving this again but will double the sauce so that I can put some on the pasta! Definitely a keeper!

It was OK - Kids really did not care for it. I think the sauce was a little too thick.

Very tasty, though the sauce has a tendency to burn. Sauce definately adds a great deal to the flavor, so be sure to make plenty.

Rich, creamy pasta. I love this recipe because I always have these ingredients on hand! I use smart balance light, 98% fat free soup, and whole grain pasta to make this healthier.

this is an awsome recipe.  you can use the sauce for many diffrent things.  instead of chicken I add cooked frozen thawed shrimp.  Secret to this sauce is add a bit of dried parsley. if it gets to thick add some more water to it  you almost can't ruin it.  Great over rice or vegatables.  Was going to try it over some spaghetti squash.

This recipe was ok. Even for a bland eater, this was bland for me. But, I have to say this is a great starting place for tweaking. I'll start here & expand next time.

Like any recipe I make from this site, it's a work in progress with taste-testing to get the recipe where 
I love it.  I read reviews and take from them suggestions and tweek it myself.  I used a can of Healthy Valley Organic cream of chicken soup and added 2 Tbsp of Italian seasoning, dried parsley, 4 pressed garlic cloves, 1 Tbsp mushroom broth, onion powder, onions, and my favorite ingredient-Penzeys Spices Ruth Ann's seasoning. I add the salty ingredients carefully. I sliced the chicken breast and and served it over brown rice pasta with the sauce topping it off with steamed fresh asparagus and freshly shaved Parmesan blend cheeses. It came out tasting like Olive Garden's chicken scampi!  These recipes are a spring board-take them where you want!-Hobie1

I thought this was absolutely disgusting. I did exactly as the recipe offered, using pasta and everything. I served it with salad on the side, and I will never cook it again.

This is one of my kids favorite meals. Definitely double the sauce.
