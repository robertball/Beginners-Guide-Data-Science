This was a very different type of cookie.  Nutty and savory-sweet.  I really liked it.  I made a fwe changes due to the other comments.  I used half of the baking soda, added a half cup more of coconut and sunflower seeds, 1/4 tsp of salt and also an egg (which hlped bind the batter better)

I found the baking soda a bit overmuch for me personally, imho.  If I did the recipe again I would use a half or quarter teaspoon baking soda instead, with the sugar changed to brown sugar to balance the alkali/acid ratio.

I agree that the baking soda was a little too much. They had a great flavor otherwise, but they were pretty crumbly. I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I would probably make these again. :)

These cookies were very easy to make. They have a wonderful taste to them. I made these for a baking club, and everyone loved them.

I have done a similar recipe in the past, and would suggest adding honey or golden syrup for moistness and 1 egg to bind it all together.

I stuck strictly to the recipe, and these were just ok for me.  The consistency of the cookie was great, a nice crunch while still a little soft. Definitely will take the advice of others regarding the baking soda and substituting some brown sugar.

The taste was good but the texture was too dry in the batter form to create little balls. I ended up adding 1/2 c. milk so there would be some binding. I also took the advice and did 1/2 the amount of baking soda and used 1/2brown and 1/2white sugar.

These were pretty good, I made all the changes (sugars etc...) that everyone mentioned and I added dried cranberries. I'd make these again.

My friends ask me for the recipe when I serve this!  Works wonderfully with silicone baking sheet.  Great way to use up leftover sunflower seeds and coconut.

uh....it dunno tasted really bitter. I dont know what it is the sunflowers? it was very crispy and nutty. I was really worried when the batter seemed to crumble apart but at the same time it was SO oily from the butter. Probably wont make again- too fattening while not tasting that great.

Lots of changes, tastes great! Per suggestions: 1 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup brown, 2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1 teaspoon baking soda, add 1 egg, used butter. Balls held together.
With 1" balls, makes about 6 dozen!  2" cookies, so cut the nutrition information in half.
