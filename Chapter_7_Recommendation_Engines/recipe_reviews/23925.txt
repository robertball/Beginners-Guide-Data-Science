These were good but the chocolate center wasn't quite hot enough while the outside was golden brown.  Perhaps next time, I will melt the hugs and kisses first.

I used semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of kisses and I thought they were really good. However, I wish I had waited until they cooled instead of eating them warm out of the oven. I think the chocolate would have tasted better. I also made cinnamon/sugar crescents by spreading a thin layer of butter over the dough and then sprinkling on a cinnamon sugar mixture and rolling them up. We liked those ones even better then these chocolate ones, they were like nice warm cinnamon buns. You'll have to give them a try. Maybe I'll try combining the two next time for some cinnamon chocolate chip crescents.

These were great and simple, once I figured out the temperature.  I baked them at 350 for 10 minutes, and half way through I turned the pan around to make sure it all browned evenly. Instead of hershey's kisses I used semi-sweet chocolate chips.  It was really good.  I brought it to a church function and everyone loved it!  Even after serving it completely cooled everyone loved it.  Next time, in addition to the powdered surgar I think I'll try drizzling it with chocolate, or fudge!

They looked good, but did not care for them.  The cresent rolls just did not blend well with the kisses.  It was like I was eating two different things.  Cathy Helms

These were a big hit with my dinner guests-  I don't think they would be very good once they are cooled off, but fresh out of the oven they are delicious!

HUGE HIT with kids, of course!! The ONLY thing I've done different since I've first starting making this was I decreased the amount of Hershey Kisses to just 2 per crescent.  (Hey my kids are hyper enough, lol:).

These get an A+ for quickness and easiness but unless you like SUPER rich food, you won't love these.  My whole family loves chocolate but nobody thought these were great.  Way too sweet.

These were great.  FINALLY a way to use up all those "school fundraiser" candy bars (that are always huge and who would want one of your kids eating a whole one of those as a snack).  I just used bricks of the giant Hershey bars, dusted them with cinamin sugar...and wallah!  A great new snack that they can microwave for 10 seconds after school.

Nobody in my house liked them. You have to eat them immediatley. Maybe if it was a different kind of chocolate, or smaller chocolate chips it would be better

These are the easiest things to make and they taste yummy, too.  I made them for Christmas Eve dessert and they were a huge hit.  They do definetely have the unmistakable flavor of a Hershey's Kiss, but it melts into the most wonderful gooey filling.  My 2 year old loved them.  This one's a keeper!

Absolutely fabulous! I used the Hershey nuggets with almond, and just used one per crescent, then put the finished product on a plate and drizzled Hershey's syrup on top. Very big response from the family-will make these again and often, I'm sure!

OH MY!!!! These were so good. I made crescent rolls for dinner and saved some of the triangles for this dessert. After eating it, I was glad I only made one per person or I would have eaten them all!! I served them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and drizzled with chocolate syrup. I always have these ingredients on hand, so now I can serve an elegant dessert for those nights when my husband decides to bring home his boss at the last minute!

These are so easy to make. I used Hugs because my Boyfriend doesn't like to much milk chocolate. I didn't add the sugar on top but they still turn out well. Will make these again anytime I need a quick desert.

These were awful.  I felt like I was eating kisses and bread.  Definitely will not make again.  They were too sweet and the croissant (pillsbury) was too bland.  I ended up throwing them all away.  What a waste!

WONDERFUL!  We had a big family dinner so while everyone was recovering from the turkey, I rolled these up real quick, popped them in the oven, sprinkled with the sugar and cinnamon, and served them with a scoop of ice cream with a bit of chocolate syrup.  I got rave reviews.  Every one of my in-laws wanted to recipe.  Thanks!

These were pretty good, but you MUST serve them warm!  They were exceptionally fast, easy and cheap to make!

Amazingly quick and easy, and such a big hit with my guests!  I added some cinnamon to the powdered sugar as suggested and served chocolate syrup on the side.

my family loved this as a brunch treat and it could not be easier. For a little extra kick, we used dark chocolate and it was beyond delicious!!

I wasn't really sold on this recipe but I did have the cresent rolls & kisses to make them, and so I did...and was I ever glad!  My hubby was also immediately sold on them and I really liked them with the cinnamon in the icing sugar. Next time I'll try them with different chocolate too!

These were a wonderful little dessert I served with ice cream and fresh strawberries.  Couldn't have been any quicker or easier.  My boyfriend just LOVED them, and downed 3 without even blinking.  Will definitely make these over and over again.

SUPER EASY!  These took about 2 minutes to make (once I unwrapped the kisses).  They tasted ok.  I mixed cinnamon in with the powdered sugar and sifted it on top of them all.  With a little Hershey's syrup swirled on the plate, powdered sugar on top and a strawberry cut and fanned on the side, this looked a little elegant.

Suprisingly very good! They were nice and soft. The melted chocolate inside was the best. I put some cinnamon in the confectioner's sugar. I also enjoyed them w/ two kisses in each, especially if you plan on eating more then one! Three was very rich!

Very, very, very quick and easy.  I assembled them in less than five minutes, and they baked while I cleaned up the dinner mess.  Perfect for a quick, easy chocolate fix.
