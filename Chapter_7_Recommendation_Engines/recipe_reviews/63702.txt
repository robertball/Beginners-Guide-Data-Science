I made these mini cheesecakes to bring in to work and received rave reviews.  No one could believe that they were low fat/low calorie/low sugar!  I substituted Splenda for the sugar to cut down more, and I only baked them for 15 minutes.  I would definitely recommend this recipe for cheesecake lovers looking for a little healthy bite!

This was really good. I am not sure if I made it right though as I found it a bit too sweet and I did not find that it looked like the pictures. I could not find the neufchatel cheese in the grocery store but after researching it, i found that it was basically cream cheese so thats what i used. I did not find it turned yellowish until the vanilla and eggs.. Does anyone know if i did something wrong? Anyways it was really good. A definite must try. I didnt have any kiwi so instead I sliced fresh peaches and let them sit in fresh lime juice and rind. After I put them on the actually cheesecakes i sprinkled a little sugar over the peaches. It was very good and fresh tasting.

These individual cheesecakes got rave reviews at a party I recently attended.  They turned out beautiful and delicious.  And no one felt guilty eating them.

Yum!  I was suprised that these were as good as they were.  I used a tbs of lime juice instead of the lime zest.  Again, YUM.  Thanks for the recipe

I took it to a Easter family get-together and it was a hit!  I added a bit more lime juice than called for (I juiced a whole lime) and a couple of more T. of sugar. It's hard to believe you're eating something low fat!

This recipe was EXCELLENT.  My husband said it's definately a keeper and my two little girls each had seconds.

I made some significant changes:

I had made homemade cottage cheese yesterday (dry milk, water, lemon juice) which was somewhat tart, but it worked great in the recipe.  I mixed all the ingredients in my blender.  

After adding the sugar it was too thick to mix, so I used the amount of water called for in my egg replacer, then added the remaining ingredients--zesting an entire lime and using the juice of one whole lime.  I added the vanilla and Ener-G egg replacer powder at the very end.  Then poured it over graham cracker pieces.  

They turned out VERY well.  My daughter is allergic to eggs and I was so glad this turned out with egg replacer.

We served it with the yogurt but didn't have any kiwi fruit.

Hubby loves cheesecake, but didn't want something too "decadent" for Father's Day meal. Stumbled upon this in my recipe box - so glad! My only changes next time - omit lime rind (couldn't grate it fine enough) and increase the lime juice a touch, to accentuate the flavor, and cool/chill the cakes on top of paper towels (in their wrappers/still in the tins to keep shape) as the bottom of the wrapper got moist. Really surprised at how smooth pureed cott cheese comes out - never would have guessed!

Very easy and delicious...you can make it very elegant, by serving on individual dishes, and some fruit garnish.  I chiiled the cakes, and then took off the wrappers, and served.

What a big hit these were.  It was in late summer and I was going to a Body Shop party.  I was craving something cool, healthy, and tasty.  These were just the ticket!  That was two summers ago and I still get requests to make these yummy treats!

You would not know that these were made with cottage cheese and vanilla yogurt.  They are delicious.  I made them for a catering affair and they were gone.
