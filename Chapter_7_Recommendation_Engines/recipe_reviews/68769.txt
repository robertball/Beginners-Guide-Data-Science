Very pleasantly surprised by how well this recipe turned out! Used EVOO, seasoned chops well with Lawry's seasoned salt, pepper and granulated garlic. Used balsamic vinegar. Instead of tomato juice, I used a can of Picante V8 and a can of petite cut diced tomatoes. Added fresh rosemary and mushrooms at that point, used frozen green beans (16 oz.) and Tabasco Chipotle Sauce for the heat. Also had to thicken the sauce with 2 Tbsp. cornstarch, etc. and served over brown rice. Beautiful presentation... if everyone had not dug in so quickly, I would have loved to have taken a photo!
Will most likely make this recipe again. Thank you, BRIDESTEIN.

I wasn't sure that I would like this or not.  But it turned out very good.  I used tomato sauce instead of juice and fresh mushroms.  The chops came out wonderfully tender and the sauce had just the right zip.  Don't leave out the Frank's, it makes the dish.  Thanks!!

This was very nice!  I did make some changes from other suggestions.  I used 2 cans tomato sauce, instaed of juice and I added 2 tablespoons of flour to the sauce when I added it.  I also added the mushrooms at the time I added the sauce.  I think next time I make this, I will cook the greenbeans separate, because I had brown rice with the tomato sauce, too.

This was ok, but it was too tomatoey for my liking.  Maybe if another base was used other than tomato juice, and only some tomato was added later this would be better.

This is one of our family's favorite recipes. I agree that the tomato juice makes for a thin sauce, but the flavor is so much better than paste or sauce. We like to eat this in bowls, kind of like stew. With that in mind, you could also cube the pork before you brown it.

I agree with the last 3 submitters.  This is good, but the hot sauce REALLY makes the dish, I think without it this dish would be very bland, and the sauce and veggies are GREAT on brown rice.

While this had really good flavor, the sauce was way too thin.  I will try it next time using tomato sauce instead of juice.

Very good!  Omitted the mushrooms as we didn't have any.  Also let it cook for part of the time with the lid off to let the liquid reduce a bit.  Tasted great with rice pilaf and rolls.

My husband LOVED these Pork Chops. After reading several of the reviews, I did make some changes (very unusual for me).  I used 1 (11.5 oz) can of tomato juice, 1 (14.5 oz) can of Garlic, Oregano and Basil diced tomatoes. I seasoned the pork chops with salt, pepper, garlic and onion salt then browned. Also, cut back the hot sauce to 1 TBSP.  For the simmering process I simmered for about 15-20 minutes covered and the last 10-15 minutes uncovered to let the sauce reduce. This will definitely be a keeper for me now!!!

The consensus feels the taste is bland and the sauce too watery, but since I had most of the ingredients, I decided to try it with a few modifications.  Since its tomato-based, it definitely needs some garlic and onions.  Most pizziola sauced and marinara sauces have that so you can't go wrong.  My fix so the taste is not bland - add 2 cloves minced garlic and 1/2 cup chopped onion about a minute before the chops are done browning.  Also increase spices (I used oregano, fresh parsley and crushed red pepper to the sauce).  To fix the watery issue - in lieu of 23-ounces of tomato juice (that is a lot of liquid) I used a 14-ounce can of diced tomatoes and 1/2 cup of tomato sauce to thicken it up. My only other change was I used slightly under the 1/2 cup water recommended since this also contributes to soupy consistency.  Other than that, i rate this a "4" and would make again like this!

Had to use up some ingredients in the house and this recipe fit the bill.  Definitely wouldn't go looking to get the ingredients to make this again.  Completely lacking in anything appealing in the flavor department.  Edible but not enjoyable.

I and my family love this dish.  I do substitute diced tomatoes for the tomato juice and I always tend to bump up the spices, particularly garlic, just because we like it a lot.  The flavor is great and I love that it's done all in one pan.  I usually serve with rice.

I give this recipe 2 stars, my husband a 4, so we'll settle for a 3. I thought it was very, very bland, but he inhaled his, caveman-style. I followed the recipe exactly, except I rubbed the pork chops in salt, pepper, and paprika prior to browning them (also tossed a handful of red onion and red bell pepper in the skillet for color), and used red white vinegar. The "sauce" was so watery, I had to serve dinner in soup bowls, so I wish that I'd taken the suggestion of other reviewers and either thickened it w/ corn starch, or possibly used tomato sauce/paste, or less juice. I appreciate trying out a new recipe, but I think I'll stick to baking my pork chops and serving them w/ the green beans, mushrooms, or alternate veggie on the side.

We thought this was just ok. I didn't think the sauce was flavorsome at all - I added a lot more seasoning, plus some diced tomatoes, and a splash of Worcestershire sauce. I also thought it was extremely watery. I'm glad others liked it, but I won't be making this again. Thanks anyway.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I had to use yellow beans instead of green beans, but I don't think there's much difference in the tastes anyway.  I also put the vegetables in at the same time as the tomato sauce which worked well for me.

For us, the flavor was decent.  But I definitely feel that changes need to be made to this recipe.  It was way too watery.  I even put less tomato juice in than required and it was just all liquid.  Pork chops floating in a pile of liquid in my skillet.  I didn’t mind the canned green beans but should have used fresh sliced mushrooms (and more of them than 4 oz.).  This could be a 4 or 5 star recipe if it was not so soupy because like I said before, the flavor was decent.  I paired this with white rice too and it was a good compliment to the meal.

This is the same recipe my mom made, and I have made over the years. It isn't supposed to have a thick sauce. If you must have thicker, use tomato sauce or purée, and simmer the sauce down some.  Good just as the recipe is written but you can use fresh green beans too.  Make sure your spices are fresh, and this dish will have plenty of flavor.

I made 10 thin, boneless pork chops with this recipe.  I used fresh garlic instead of powder, and added 2 lbs of fresh green beans and 8 oz. fresh mushrooms, and a 28 oz. can of tomatoes, which gave it a nice consistency...not watery.  I followed the recipe, but doubled all ingredients, except the hot sauce....I used 1 and a half tablespoons only and that gave it just enough zip.  Served it with mashed potatoes....a perfect meal for a damp, rainy day in PA!  My family loved it...the fresh green beans gave it some crunch...delicious!  I will make this again!

This was very good and very easy the only thing I did was to add 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. It was a little to thin
