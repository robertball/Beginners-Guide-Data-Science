Very good. I don't have a mixer so I don't really enjoy making frosting. I mixed together everything except the butter and sugar then creamed and alternated. Once I started adding the liquid mix the stirring was much easier than with most frostings. I added about a tablespoon of corn syrup I find it helps cut the 'powdered sugar' taste. Easy to color easy to use didn't form a crust too fast which is nice (I was sprinkling sugar etc).

It was good as an icing but not the best. I would recommend adding a little lemon flavor to it.

Very tasty!! I made it exactly like the recipe read... and ended up with left over sugar. The frosting got really thick quick! I added a little milk to soften it and attempted to frost a cake. I am an amateur at cake frosting maybe thats why I had so much trouble. The milk I added made the frosting too soft to use in my cake decorating attachments. I was afraid to add anything more to it....all in all a great tasting frosting!!!

This was too sweet and pretty thick. It is possible that you could add more butter (maybe 3T more) and decrease the sugar by 1/2 cup depending on how sweet you want it by using 2 cups of sugar then tasting it then adding a little more until you get to the right sweetness and thickness. It may not happen but I hope it does.

They should mention that making red frosting with this recipe is very difficult just as most frostings. After adding a bunch of red it still looks pink.
