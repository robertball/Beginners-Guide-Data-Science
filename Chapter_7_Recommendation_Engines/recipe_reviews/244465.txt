This was a tasty little side dish. Very fresh, easy to prepare, and beautifully colourful. The parmesan was a nice touch! My only complaint is that my husband & I found the flavours a wee-bit bland. The first time making it, I really wanted to stick exactly to the recipe... Going forward I will probably jazz it up with a bit more seasonings. Over all though, yummy!

This recipe was a total hit for us. My husband's first bite brought a "ummmm" delight! I used 1 HUGE homegrown patty pan squash from our daughter's garden and found that I needed to cover the pan for about 6 to 7 minutes to get the cooking process going, then lid off to continue sautéing. I also used 2 cups of packed spinach. We have plenty leftover for an other meal. Try this recipe. It's a winner!

I was in a hurry getting dinner ready and was looking for a Squash side dish . I Misread the directions and found myself short of lemon juice and spinach.  The parsley and basil were from the spice rack, not fresh.  I was making lasagna that day, so I had some  "fancy shredded "  parmesan on hand. It turned out very good. My wife and kids loved it.  It would have probably been better if I had had all the ingredients as the recipe suggested. But still, I was more than satisfied with it.

Delicious! I followed the recipe as stated except I dumped in the whole package of spinach (5 oz plastic tub). I will be making again and adding ground turkey for a complete meal. 

Also great for breakfast with sunny side eggs on top!

Nice easy recipe for a quick summer side dish. I added zucchini because I had some on hand, and omitted the cheese because I was out. But it was still flavorful and delicious. This was my first time trying patty pan squash and I was thankful to find an easy recipe.

I didn’t have Parmesan but I had pecorino romano, and I only had parsley flakes as I don’t have any growing fresh right now. Delicious recipe and probably even better with fresh parsley and Parmesan! I did wait until toward the end of cooking the squash to add the garlic, as I didn’t want it to burn. That worked great and the garlic flavor comes through nicely. Beautiful way to use the squash from my garden!

I chose not to use spinach, as it is irretrievably bitter to me no matter how it's prepared. That said, it turned out extremely well. I paired it with pan-fried pork chops and white cheddar mac-n-cheese for a light-to-medium Sunday dinner.

This was very good. Very flavorful. I added more than a dash of lemon pepper, gave it a few good shakes. I used dried basil and parsley, and added a little summer savory. I also added some cherry tomatoes because I had them. But think it would have been just fine without them.

We love squash so I am alway looking for another way to fix it and this did not disappoint. It was easy, delicious and was a really pretty presentation too. I did not have much spinach to add so I cut what I had along with the parsley with my five blade herb sizzors and that gave a great taste cooked fast and a gourmet look! Thank you so much for this delicious recipe. We will be making it again and again.   CO Karen

I used this recipe to cook the adorable baby patty pan squash and baby zucchini that I had. To make it into a meal, I added left over chicken fajitas and served it over plain fettucine pasta. It was very good. I omitted the optional spinach simply because I did not have any. While this is good as is, next time, I may add lemon zest and a little bit of dry red pepper flakes.

This was very good. Then husband liked it even though he's not fond of squash.
