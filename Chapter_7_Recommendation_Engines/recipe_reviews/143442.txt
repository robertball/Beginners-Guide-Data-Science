I liked this tea even though I'm not big on the liquorice taste of fennel. I used some tea from tea bags I got in a hotel room, I figured you can't get cheaper than that. I've never been on an Indian train, but something tells me there should be some ginger in this. It is nice and re-heats well. Thank you KitchenBarbarian for this recipe.
