These were very, very good but a lot of work.  They make a fantastic dessert, but the recipe poster is correct when she said they don’t keep well.  So while I love them and they taste of spring, I wouldn’t make them for a party or bring to a pot luck.  They make an awesome weekend dessert for family, though, and I’ll make them again.
