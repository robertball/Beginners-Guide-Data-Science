This was absolutely delicious! I couldn't find any jalapeno cheese, so I added a can of Rotel to Velveeta cheese instead. It came out so creamy and yummy!! This is definitely a keeper!!

Add a tablespoon of mashed capers (releases flavor) and mince bell pepper, two cloves chopped garlic, three medium green onions and saute lightly before adding the heavy cream.  Bring cream to frothy simmer until slightly thickened, turn heat to low and add two bars of chopped jalapeno cheese (use habenero cheese if available and if you dare).  Stir until cheese melts, then add chopped cooked chicken breast (or crawfish, or shrimp and or crabmeat and or chopped oysters for a truly over-the top-dish).  Garnish with rough chopped, toasted pecans after adding sauce to cooked fettuccine.   Easier than it may sound and results in a truly gourmet dish that will easily earn five stars!
