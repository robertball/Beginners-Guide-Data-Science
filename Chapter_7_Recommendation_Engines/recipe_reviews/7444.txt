My family really enjoys this cake. My wife is not able to have sugar so I substitute 1 cup of Splenda(R) and 2/3 cup of honey for the sugar. I also use cocoa powder as the substitute for the melted chocolate. Works out great and my wife enjoys having a dessert she can eat.

Really moist. Great made in a bundt pan and drizzled with chocolate glaze while still warm!

I love this cake!! The texture is what gets me the most it's wonderful. This is not a rich chocolate cake with strong chocolate flavor it's very mild. I followed the recipe exact baked for the 40 mins. and it was perfect. I will definitely make this again I do think that frosting this with a rich chocolate frosting will take away from the mildnes in this cake compete too much with the flavor. I used Rick's Special Buttercream Frosting from the site and it really complimented the cake. Thanks for the recipe (:

I was planning this cake for my husband's birthday but boy am I glad I tried it out before the big day. This cake was not flavorful at all--and way too little chocolate to call it a chocolate cake. My husband hated it.

This tasted really good. I frosted it with canned whipped chocolate icing. My only problem with this recipe is that it didn't make a very fluffy cake. It was kind of flat and dense like a sheet cake. Don't know if it's supposed to be like this or what happened. I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of using cake flour but one would think the cake flour would make it more fluffy. So 4 stars for the taste but had to subtract one for the texture.

This was pretty good. I would have liked to add more chocolate to the batter next time. I also stopped adding the water because the batter looked like it was getting to thin. I had about 1/4 cup left. Frosted it with white buttercream... Thanks

This was a simple recipe that sounded good but I thought it lacked chocolate flavor. In addition it has a tough exterior crust. This is not a tender cake nor flavorful. I would not bake this cake again.

I have been baking this cake for my great nieces birthday for about five or six years it's her choice every year.On the second year the pan was a bit to big for a double batch and it came out like a brownie the best brownies we ever had!

Our teenage kids loved it! I added milk chocolate chips which made it super moist and deliciously rich. Definitely a hit in our house. And they normally are not big sweet eaters.

I d call this brownie cake. It s just like a brownie consistency. I used homemade mayonnaise in mine as well as 2 ounces of unsweetened chocolate and cake flour which increased the amount of flour by four tablespoons and baked it an hour in a bundt pan. Then I iced it with ganache made of a half cup heavy cream and a half cup of semisweet chocolate chips. It is delicious!
