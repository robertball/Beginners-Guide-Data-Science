Ganache recipes can vary greatly in chocolate to cream ratios - this version falls somewhere in the middle and is great! I like to simplify the process by chopping the chips in my food processor until they resemble fine crumbs. Then I heat the cream in a heavy bottomed saucepan until it just starts to bubble around the edges, pour the hot cream down the feed tube of the food processor, add the vanilla and give it a whirl... in seconds you have wonderful ganache. I should mention that chocolate chips contain stabilizers that allow them to keep their shape while they are warm, and those stabilizers don't melt down smoothly like chocolate does, so for a smoother finished product, I strain the warm ganache through a fine mesh strainer (this is not a necessary step, but will give more professional results). Use this ganache warm as a pourable glaze, let it cool to room temp (over night) and use like a standard frosting, or chill until firm and whip with a heavy stand mixer until it's lighter in color and spreadable. You can even use this ganache to make authentic chocolate truffles - just roll the chilled ganache (unwhipped) into balls and coat with cocoa powder, chopped nuts, or whatever. By the way, I used this recipe to cover a chocolate wedding cake and it turned out wonderfully! One more hint: if you use this ganache to "frost" a cake, but be sure to bring the cake to room temperature before cutting (using a hot knife). You'll love this extremely versatile and tasty recipe!

Normally I insist on using a good quality chocolate for ganache but today I just threw a doctored up cake mix together quickly and thought this chocolate chip version would be "good enough."  To my surprise, it was better than just "good enough" and I was pleased to glaze my cake with it.  (And I even forgot to add the vanilla!)  I chilled it just long enough to make it of thick pouring consistency so that it adhered to the cake nicely without most of it running  off.  I had quite a bit left over, so I just refrigerated it for another time.  Maybe I'll melt it again and use it as a glaze for cupcakes, or a fudgy topping for cheesecake.  Or maybe I'll let it come to room temperature and whip the heck out of it for a fluffier frosting.  Or maybe I'll heat it up and pour it over ice cream, or stir some into hot milk, or....

I cooked this a day ahead of time and put it in the fridge overnight.  To get the ganache to a pourable state, I let it get to room temperature then put the glass bowl I had it in over a pot of simmering water to 're-melt' it.  It was perfect.  I poured it over a layered ice cream cake I made for a birthday and they were very impressed.   Delish!  =)

This was excellent. I always wanted to make this and I really loved it. It was different to work with, you can put it in between layers or use as a rich icing. It left such a nice shine on the cakes. I had enough to cover a 3 layer cake and a small heart cake. It had a flavor that was divine. Everyone was very impressed with this cake already requesting it for special occasions. I wanted to make something very special for my nephews 16th birthday. I made a 3 layer cake, 2 layers were a yellow butter cake and the middle layer was chocolate. I put a vanilla butter cream between 2 layers and a chocolate butter cream between the other 2 layers. Covered the entire cake with the ganache then made a whipped cream for the top, sprinkled it with chocolate shavings and ground almonds.  I believe it was my best work thus far. 
Thanks for this recipe.

The Pro Ganache was not very Pro in my book. I used it to pour on a cake and the icing was both thin (I did not overheat it), and it cracked which made it look not very "Pro". I followed the recipe exactly and used good quality Ghiradelli chocolate chips. I'll keep looking for a good ganache recipe.

I made this recipe the first time and felt it wasn't quite the flavor I was happy with.  Then I made it again did half semi-sweet chocolate and have milk chocolate and it was great.

One of my favourite things about this recipe is that it's so easy to scale it. I quarter it and get a perfect amount for one 8 or 9 inch cake. I also use half milk chocolate melts and half good quality non-baking chocolate, usually Lindt 70% cocoa chocolate. 
This is a delicious and versatile recipe that I use all the time. Can't recommend it highly enough! :D

This recipe worked very well for me. I did only a half batch, because I was just pouring it on a small oatmeal cake. I used a little different tecnique then this recipe recomended. I put the whipping cream and vanilla in a sauce pan over med heat. I then added my choc. and just stirred it untill it was all melted. Brought it to a slight boil over med/high heat, and then poured it directly over my cake, and sprinkled it with flaked coconut. Very yummy!

This stuff is incredible. Whipped a bit - you can keep it in the fridge and serve it as chocolate pots. My family can't stay out of it.

I've been using this recipe for years and am finally reviewing it.  It's the best ganache recipe here!  It pours very smoothly, it sets up perfectly and whips to a delectable consistency.  I've used it to pour over a Gateaux au Chocolat, over a Boston Cream Pie, filling for Whoopie Pies and as a dip for fruit.

I used this as a glaze, with beautiful thin lines dripping down the sides of a wedding cake.  I found that initially it's too thin, and worked much better when allowed to cool, at room temperature, to just below 80º.  Dripped down the sides beautifully!  Also, when using chocolate chips (instead of the "good stuff") it's helpful to strain the mixture after it's been gently mixed together, yet before adding the vanilla.

This ganache was delicious and very easy to make.  The only trouble I had was that it didn't set very firm once I put it in the refrigerator overnight so instead I whipped it until light and fluffy and it worked GREAT!  Very good flavor as I used milk chocolate and semi-sweet as someone else suggested and used it on top of my cheesecake for a Christmas party and then whipped it a little thicker to pipe onto the cake.  Definately worth keeping but if someone can suggest what I can do to make it thick enough to make truffles, I'm game!

This is a spectactular ganache. So easy, and truly the best frosting, filling, glaze ever. So versatile. I cooled and whipped some to use as filling for a Too Much Chocolate Cake, then used more in it's thick liquid consistency as a glaze for the cake. It was fantastic! This will be my frosting/icing/filling of choice from now on.

Following the directions to the letter this recipe ended up thin and runny for me.  I needed to beat this near to the point of curdling inorder to get it think enough to spread.  I would go with less cream more chocolate and perhaps some butter next time.

Oh this is just fabulous. Be sure to blend it thoroughly and ideally, let it chill overnight before using it whether you choose to use it as is or whip it up. I did not whip this up but I can imagine how light and delicious it would be. Once blended it blends into a watery consistency. After chilling it's smooth like pudding but not as stiff and thick as some frostings can be. It smoothes out as you apply it. I used this with the Crazy Chocolate Cake on this site for my daughter's 7th birthday and it was just delicious.

It really does help to cover with plastic wrap.  Make sure you drop it onto the top of the chocolate.
  I absolutely love this ganache.

I used the holiday mint/chocolate chips and a bit less cream, bag was under 2 cups, and no vanilla.  Then I chilled and whipped with about 1/2 cup powdered sugar and this was truly the BEST chocolate frosting ever!  Thanks for all the hints and the easiest recipes ever.

Great ganache - best when whipped, or fully cooled and then applied (make sure you remember this step, instead of just using it right after you mix it all together!). Very tasty!

Update: love it, but I wanted to comment on the texture. It is very thick, and like I said before, makes a great whipped ganache. However, if you want fine drizzles for cake, I would cut the chocolate to 1.5 cups. It was great with Whiskey added!

I didnt feel the directions were very clear at the end, when it said to cover and let cool, it didnt say for how long, or when it was good to put on the cake.   Then, when I did put it on my cake it did not look as smooth as I would of liked.

This ganache was way too runny! I had to wait forever for it to cool before I could use it. Next time I'll try 1/2 the cream that it calls for.

Fantastic recipie! I've never made Ganache before and I am making my own wedding cake so I think I stumbled on a winner! I made this today for a practice 2 teir cake to glage it befor frosting and it turned out fantastically smooth and very rich, although I used a slightly different method: I heated the cream in a heavy bottom sauce pan then added the vanilla and chopped dark chocolate, removed from heat and stirred until smooth. Still get the same results I think. Thank you Pastrychick!

I used to work in a chocolate store and would make handmade truffles. This ganache frosting recipe is very similar to those ganache truffle fillings: very rich and also melts in your mouth! I followed this recipe exactly and it  had a very liquid consistency at first even though it had been cooled to room temperature. I solved this problem by refrigerating it overnight and then letting it warm up to almost room temperature right before frosting the cupcakes. My coworkers loved this frosting and said it appeared very light (little did they know how much heavy cream was in it).

Delicious (okay, REALLY delicious), easy, and beautiful!  I used it on the eclair cake listed on this site and now I'm sneaking tastes of the leftover ganache by itself!  This is definitely part of my dessert repertoire from now on!

Made with bittersweet chips as that's all I had, added 1/2 cup granulated sugar after the vanilla and stirred it in to sweeten my ultra-dark chocolate. Worked fine. This produced a shiny, beautiful glaze that is setting up as we speak in the fridge!

I used milk chocolate chips. I found it runny so I set it in the fridge overnight and then it poured nicely on the cake. Will definitely make it again.

This was only so-so. I followed the recipe perfectly. I will give it one more chance & will try whipping it after it cools. As is, I wouldn't make it again.

This is best if you want to dribble the warm chocolate on the plate of dessert or down the sides of a cake.  I tried whipping it for frosting, and it works ok, but there are better Ganache recipes on this site.  Check them out to find the best.

I was asked to make a 6" Hostess cupcake replica and I used this as the frosting and I got so many compliments and everyone just loved it! I let the mixture cool just enough so it would cover smoothly but not drip too much. for the spare cupcakes I had, I dipped the tops in the ganache. The cake and cupcakes really did look professional and they were really shiny!

This was my first time making ganache and while it was superb in taste (made no changes) I couldn't get it to thicken up any in the refrigerator so I'm chalking that up to me, not the recipe.  Either way, I still used as a filling for my son's birthday cake and it was delicious.  Thanks so much for sharing, I will be using it again :)

I have never made ganache before. Saying that...this is exactly how I was hoping it would turn out. I made and stuck in the fridge overnight. I made cream puffs then dipped the tops in the ganache. It adhered nicely and shinned beautifully. Not to mention the great taste.

The first time I ever tried ganache was on a wedding cake and fell deeply in love.  Two weeks later was my birthday and my sis offered to make my cake.  We made a white cake and while they cooled after baking, we added a mixture of orange extract and maple syrup over the top to soak into the cake. Once cooled we covered them with aluminum foil and made the ganache and let it sit to thicken. Frosted the cake with the ganache and put an orange glaze over it. Best birthday cake ever! Thanks sis

Sorry...this didn't work for me at all.  There was far too much liquid.  I left this in the refrigerator overnight, and it was still the consistency of chocolate syrup.  I ended up adding another cup of melted chocolate chips and some powdered sugar in order to make it solid enough to work with.

Wow, this was so easy and great! I liked the ratio of ingredients here because they are tasty AND easy to remember.  We made this to go with the Best Moist Chocolate Cake recipe found here. I used 1/3 cup less chocolate chips this time because I decided to add some to the cake batter. The icing was still plenty chocolatey.    I was in a huge hurry and wanted whipped rather than poured frosting, so I stuck the bowl in the freezer and whisked every few minutes to help cool it faster. I had whipped frosting in 1/2 hour that was very fluffy and light, but rich tasting. Thanks for posting this recipe!

A wonderful easy recipe that makes a killer ganache! I have made ganache before but never whipped it. What a difference in texture! After cooling just a bit, it was a lovely consistancy to spread on our layer cake that we had sandwhiched together with orange marmalade. The leftover ganache went into the refrigerator and I must admit that we have been dipping into the bowl with spoons all day long. The most delightful truffles could be made out of this stuff! Used Ghiradelli chocolate chips, heavy cream (versus whipping cream) and Mexican Vanilla and gosh! This is  a recipe any chocaholic would kill for!

The problem with this recipe ganache should be a 1 to 1 ratio with the cream and chocolate.  2 cups of chocolate chips are not equal to 2 cups (16oz.) cream. Each cup of chocolate chips is equal to 6 oz. not 8 oz.  You need to use at least 16 oz. of chocolate no matter the form you are using, chips or bars of chocolate. Most chefs recommend the bars not chips of a good quality chocolate.  If you do this it will not be too runny and it thickens the longer it cools.  Once cool you can whip it with your mixer until it turns a fluffy lighter chocolate frosting of spreading instead of glazing.

This was pretty good. I used 50% chocolate bars, chopped into small slivers. They melted easily under the hot cream. I didn't have any plastic wrap, so I used aluminum foil and pushed it down right on top-it worked great! I let it sit out overnight and cool, then the next morning I whipped it a bit with a hand mixer and used it to frost a birthday cake. It was a great consistency and quite tasty without being as blatantly sugary as other homemade frostings (which just taste like powdered sugar to me). All in all a success!

Exquisite. Just try and save a little for the baked good(s) you're trying to cover. I subbed a tsp of Frangelico for the vanilla once, and it was still great. Go simple, dip some roasted/salted almonds into it and take a trip to bliss. Use your best chocolate here, Ghirardelli at least - it's worth the money.

This was good but a little too rich. So I just didn't use as much on my cake and it turned out perfect!

I was very happy with this recipe!  I'm testing out various recipes as I plan on making my own two tiered wedding cake.  I'm using this recipe as a filling with raspberry jam on a triple chocolate cake.  Hopefully we like the end results!  The ganache is definitely delish!!!

So easy but perfect everytime. Used it to dip cupcakes instead of frosting and it worked exactly like we wanted. Set up with a nice shine and has a great flavor. Thanks for sharing!

You can't go wrong with this recipe especially if you use good quality melting chocolate wafers instead of chips (chips are harder to melt!). I had smooth results without using the mixer.  Also I used espresso powder instead of vanilla to bring out that great chocolate flavor. One more note, don't even bother trying to use this without refrigerating, it will just be annoying to work with. Let it sit in the refrigerator for at least an hour before using.

This a very quick delicious ganache.  It's not as bitter as the other I tried from this site and worked perfectly for my cake. I used it to top the cake and to fill the layers. I just made a frosting dam around the edge and poured in the ganache.

This was easy and very professional looking. It tasted like the inside of a truffle and got rave reviews. I followed the directions exactly and chilled the ganache in the fridge. I took the ganache out of the fridge and when it was close to room temperature, I spread it across the chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake I'd made earlier in the day. Delicious!

I used this recipe to top a cheesecake.  It was a bit too runny, so i added about a 1/3 of a cup extra chocolate chips, and that was perfectly thick.

Ganache is the easiest thing to make and always makes desserts extra special.  Plus you look like a pro as people think "ganache" is gourmet=difficult!  Pour this over some brownies and cut it after it sets and people will SING your praises!

I've made this a few times for cakes and to layer in pies and trifles, it's always a hit. 
I find it quite thin immediately after it is made, it works best if it is left to cool on the counter top for a several hours or in the fridge for a few.

Very very easy to make and turned out perfect!  I whipped as a filling, and then mixed the remainder of the ganache with the buttercream icing I was using and used that for the piping decorations.  Turned out smooth and yummy!  Thank you!

This makes such a beautiful chocolate icing!  I find that it does indeed give my cakes a more creative, decorative look.  If you are making a bundt cake, I would advise cutting the recipe in half, as it makes a LOT!

A food processor is not necessary for this icing.  Once the hot cream sits on the chocolate for a couple of minutes it mixes right up.  I poured this over eclair cake and it was delicous.

This recipe was simple, and it looked & tasted fabulous!  I made an extremely moist layered yellow cake and used an almond custard filling from this site.  I then frosted the cake with a rich chocolate frosting (also from this site).  The final touch was the ganache which I poured over the entire cake.  My guests couldn't believe that I didn't buy such an impressive cake!  I will definitely be using this recipe again!

My favorite chocolate frosting recipe!  I don't whip it, just melt everything together until smooth and cool in the fridge overnight to thicken it.  I always bring extra to parties with strawberries for dipping.

This ganache is super simple and was just the right complement to a rich chocolate cake. It wasn’t overly sweet and might have been even better with half dark and half semi sweet chocolate chips! Everyone loved it!!!

I used this recipe for the first time today to make a ganache topping for my cheesecake. I halfed the recipe. It came out perfectly. I spooned it on to my cheesecake minutes after mixing and it set up perfectly. I am following the advice of another reviewer and using the small amount of leftover to make truffles.

I was looking for a recipe for ganache that used chocolate chips and found this one.  It is simple and quick, and delicious.  I poured it on top of a large store-bought pumpkin pie, and sprinkled chopped pecans around the edge. It was beautiful, and made the pie much more festive.

My wife and I made the ganache and it was amazing in taste, but it was so thin that we couldn’t use it as it was even after following the recipe exactly as written. We decided to just add a bit of flour until we got it to our desired thickness and that made it perfect!

Has a great flavor but too runny for the pound cake I wanted it for. Next time I will use half the liquid, add CC and then adjust liquid according.

Scrumptious!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Follow the directions and it's truly fool proof.  I used this on a checkerboard cake that I made.  I crumb coated the cake with a peanut butter frosting and poured this smooth, decadent ganache over and let it run down the sides.  Then I whipped the ganache and border decorated the top and bottom.  The family was blown away with the presentation and most importantly the taste and texture!

Very good! I might adjust the ratios a bit to use a little less cream next time, but oh was it yummy! I followed another reviewer's suggestion to chop the chips in tha food processor and then add the hot cream while the food processor was running. Very quick and easy. I chilled the ganache and whipped it. It was a perfect complement to the black magic cake also from this site.

Delicious!  I used it to top a cheesecake after cooling at room temp (it was still able to be poured).  It was easy and came out nice smooth and tasty.

Delicious!  I used 1 cup bittersweet (ghiradelli) chopped up in the food processor, brought my 1 C. cream up to a boil and drizzled the hot cream into the FP while running.  I didn't add the vanilla because I forgot about it and since I was in a hurry for it to cool I poured it through a fine strainer into a cool crockery cake pan.  Using a spatula to stir it back and forth until it got to spreading consistency.  Delicious!

I used full-fat coconut milk instead of cream for a vegan chocolate ganache and it was fabulous.

I second REDJEN323.  I have made several ganaches before, and this was more like chocolate milk :\ I'd never heard of a 1-1 ratio for chocolate and cream, so I thought I'd give it a try. It did not wow in my opinion.

This needed quite a bit of time in the fridge for it to stiffen up enough to pour over my cake.  A couple of hours still left me with more a glaze than the ganache I was looking for.  Tasted great though, and no one seemed to mind the messy presentation.  I poured it over chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting.  Soooo good!

This came together well. I ended up whipping it after it chilled to frost "Too Much Chocolate Cake" form this website. It was very yummy. My only complaint was that it was very cocoa-y. Next time, I will either add powdered sugar or use milk chocolate. That is just my preference, though.

I'm not sure why this says store 3 days at room temperature. I wouldn't recommend it as it contains cream. I would also never use anything that has sat in the fridge for two weeks if there is cream in it. 3 days in the fridge tops.

I used this to top a chocolate cheesecake. I followed the recipe exactly and found it easy and yummy. It covered up all the imperfections on my cheesecake so it looked like I bought it from a bakery. I will definitely make this again thanks for the recipe!

I didn't need 4 cups, so I halved the recipe, and I wanted something more fluffy and a little less rich so I added a small tub of cool whip, I gave this one 5 stars because it was great with or without the cool whip we loved it with though :) will definately be using this recipe ALOT! Thanks for the great recipe, oh, and made it to put on the extreme chocolate cake recipe from here also :)

Did not care as much for this ganache as it made a grainy textured sauce. I've tried it 3 times thinking maybe it was me, but, no...... I have another ganache that is very smooth so I guess I'll stick to that one.

Do not use Semi-Sweet Chocolate chips for this.  It was sooooo bitter.  It tasted horrible.  I am going to try it again with milk chocolate chips.

i was disappointed in this ganache. it tasted good but i was hoping for the kind of ganache that thickens to the point you can make truffles out of it or get to a frosting consistency to spread on a cake....I realized after making it that it contains too much whipping cream to thicken like that.

This gets 5 stars for taste, but mine never set up and remained very runny.  I had put it on top of brownies and was unable to cut them ahead of eating because the ganache would have run off.  This was disappointing since I was planning to give them to a friend.
