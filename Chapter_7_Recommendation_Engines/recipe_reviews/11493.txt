We call these "Special K" bars, for the obvious reason, at our house.  My recipe calls for 1 tsp of vanilla to be added with the peanut butter. If your bars are turning out hard, you are over cooking the sugar and syrup.  Once that mixture boils, I remove the pan from the heat and add the peanut butter and vanilla. I also use butterscotch chips instead of peanutbutter ones.

I guess there is many versions of this recipe. The one I make is similar. I took it to work and my co workers all in the food industry went crazy over these! They are very rich but delish. It is: 1 cup sugar, 2/3 cup margarine, 1 cup light Karo corn syrup, 1 1/2 cup peanut butter, 1 tsp. vanilla, 8-9 cups cornflakes, 12 oz. peanut butter chips and 12 oz. chocolate chips. Using a large pot, mix sugar, marg, and syrup over med. heat just until it comes to a boil. Remove from heat and add peanut butter, van, and corn flakes. Mix well. Press into 13x9 greased pan. Cool. Melt peanut butter and choc chips together in microwave until melted and spread on top of corn flakes. Keep in frigerator. So fast and easy!

Great, easy dessert.  Very quick to make.  I left out the chocolate chips and peanut butter chips.  They're great on their own.  One important thing:  Cut these in the pan while they're still warm!!!!  You'll never get the knife through them when they cool off.  They're still soft enough to chew, but very hard to cut!  I'm glad I cut them beforehand!!!!!

You can use ANY cereal; we used a variety to use them up. There were Cheerios, Golden Grahams, and a little Lucky Charms. You could also  use creamy or crunchy peanut butter. The batch we made we didn't have any peanut butter chips for the topping so we used 2 cups milk chocolate chips. I think it was peanuty enough anyway! I like that you can vary it so many ways. I bet it would be even chewier with thinner cereal like flakes or good with rice krispies too.  It's good still warm but chewier when room temperature. I suggest cutting when still a little warm because cutting it cold was hard. The kids make this every time...it is so easy!

I made these with Cinnamon Toast Crunch (which I love) and natural peanut butter and they are delicious!!  The only problem I had is when I tried to eat one after leaving them in the fridge, they were as hard as rocks.  I think I'm going to leave them out on the counter instead of in the fridge - I wasn't sure what to do either way, so we'll give that a shot.  Delicious though - great recipe.  Thanks!!

Use brown sugar instead of white and they will come out softer and lots easier to cut.

Super easy to make. I used Cheerios. It was a hot day, so I cooked the sugar and karo syrup in the microwave on medium until it boiled.  It worked great.

WOW!  These are so much better than rice crispy bars it isn't even funny.  I used a combination of cereals I had left over including Kashi Mighty Kids and chex.  These are beyond addictive.  I didn't have any trouble cutting them thanks to the suggestion another reviewer gave to remove the corn syrup mixture quickly.

Very easy and very delicious! I like that you can use different cereals and it still comes out great. I teach pre-k and we cook on Fridays I can't wait to try this out with them.  Thanks Cindy

I should have used my better judgement and omitted the melted chocoate.  It was so messy and sugary that I couldn't package these for school like I hoped.  I liked the blend of Cheerios, Crispies and Chocolate Cripies which was also handy for using up nearly empty boxes of ceral in the pantry.  These are very satisfying.  They filled me up and satisfied my sweet tooth.  My son came home asking for them every day until they were gone.  The bars were hard as a rock from the fridge but softened up within 5 minutes on the counter.  Worth trying, but I think these were too sweet and messy for us to make again.

I followed recipe exactly and they were very good. They are really hard to cut after refrigeration however. I couldn't cut them before because the frosting was still melty, but maybe next time I will take off the boiling syrup right away like others suggest and let frosting harden at room temperature before cutting.

Delicious!!  Followed recipe as is using rice crispies cereal.  I put in frig just until choc was firm enough to cut.  A little difficult cutting into cereal but well worth the effort.  Will follow advice to take karo off heat as soon as it boils next time.  Humid here, so I keep them in the frig.  Sooo good.  Will make again for sure.

I used Rice Krispies instead of Special K cereal to make them more like scotcheroos and a jelly roll pan instead of a 9x13 to make them flatter. I suggest doubling the chips for the topping because 1 cup each doesn't give a whole lot of room for spreading.

Not what I was hoping for! I thought the Karo (?) made the cereal way too sticky and chewy. The choc topping sat on top rather than melting down into the cereal, which I didn't expect either. I did get a recipe from a friend for something similar, just using choc/butterscotch/pb chips and cereal - nothing else. They turned out great- nice and crispy. Sorry!

I haven't had these in probably 15 years.  My aunt used to make them, but I never had the recipe.   For one batch I substituted the peanut butter chips with butterscotch chips because that is how she used to make them.

I've been eating special K bars since I was a kid, they have always been my favorite.  I lost my mothers recipe, so I found this one.  One of the reviews mentions to add margarine.  I tried it and it was too greasy.  Next time I'll stick to the original recipe (except with special K and butterscotch).  Also, if you don't flatten out the cereal in the pan, spreading the chocolate is tricky.

I felt that the corn syrup in this recipe made it a little too... corn syrup-y. If I were to make it again I would use much less, if at all. The mixture of the peanut butter chips and semi-sweet chocolate was just right to satisfy a chocolate fix, and the cereal (I used rice crispies) gave it a great crunch. Overall, good recipe.

Im rating it four because of all the sugar! wow! I only used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2cup corn syrup and maybe 3Tbs of honey. That compbined with the peanut butter and chocolate gives it pleanty of stick, no need for all the rest of the sugar. Great way to use up odds and ends cereal though! I used up some Honey Bunches and Fiber One's version of Honey Bunches. Also couldn't find peanut butter chips so I took another reviewers advice and used butter-scotch chips. Great for a grab and go breakfast!

I have been looking for this recipe for a long time and finally found it!!  I would suggest using more cereal, though, as when I used Cheerios, I increased the amount to 8 cups, and still had the gooey peanut butter stuff pooling at the bottom.  My kids loved them even though, and so did I!

Great recipe!!  The best part is how easy they are to make and how much the kids love them! I make them without the chocolate/peanut butter topping and they are still amazing and a bit more healthy.  Cut them while they're still warm, it's easier.  Thanks a lot!!!

We loved it at my house.  I'm not the best cook in the world, but these turned out wonderfully.  I'm so glad we tried this recipe!  Next time I think I will try it with Cinnamon Toast Cruch.

These are a great summer time cookie/treat because they don't heat up the house! So quick and easy and everyone loves them. I put them in the freezer for about 10 minutes and they are ready to gobble down! You can also use all chocolate chips, or half butterscotch chips in place of peanut butter chips if you don't have them on hand.

My bf's mom gave us a huge bag of chex mix and it was sitting on the counter for over a month.  I decided to try this recipe using our chex mix and it turned out AWESOME!  The first batch was gone in less than two days..... We found a way to eat our chex mix from now on.  Thanks Cindy!!

Theses were great.  I used chunky peanut butter in the syrup mixture. And instead of melting the chocolate chips I sprinkled butterscotch chips over and then melted frosting and poured it over.  Really good.

Wow!  These are such tasty treats.  I used 4 cups of Rice Krispies and 3 cups of Bran Flakes. Thanks for the advice to cut them before refrigerating them.

I have used brown sugar which is great, too.  Also, whatever cereal you have.  Even mix and match.  I like to use corn flakes, rice krispies, and Special K.  Smashing the cereal makes it good.  And I don't prefer to frost them, but butterscotch chips with chocolate chips is a good mix.  Another tip is to put a few mini-chocolate chips into the cereal mixture when stirring.  It makes a swirl effect which adds a little chocolate but not so much as the frosting.

I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, 1 1/2 cups corn syrup, 1 1/2 cups peanut butter, and 6 cups speacial K cereal.  Remove sugar mixture from heat AS SOON AS it begins to boil.  PRESS the cereal mixture into the pan.  For the topping use 12 oz. semisweet chocolate chips, and 1/3 cup peanut butter.

I'd never had cereal bars and I'd never made them but these were fantastic! Everyone loved them, I even served them to my knitting group and everyone really enjoyed them. Thanks! Oh and I didn't have peanut butter chips so I melted 3/4 cup of peanut butter and 1/4 cup of sugar with my semi-sweet chocolate chips for the topping - so good!

I used up 3 types of cereals that our family wouldn't finish. Honey bunches of oats, kix and smart start (bran flakes), and they just loved them! We think they are especially good warm. I drizzled them with chocolate and only used the chocolate chips (no peanut butter chips). I doubled the recipe and I'm glad I did, they are already asking when I'll make them again!

Extremely easy and fast.  I didn’t have enough rice cereal to make 7 cups, so used some coco puffs which looked like chocolate chips in the bar.  Added a teaspoon of vanilla to the peanut butter as well.  Also took the advice of another and cut into squares before chilling in the refrigerator.  Grandkids loved them and so did my hubby and I.  Will definitely make again!

I agree with the others. Excellent recipe. But if refrigerated, very hard to cut. I actually broke a knife! I’ll not refrigerate next time.

Made this as a father's day gift for the patriarch of our family. I did make with crunchy peanut butter and with butterscotch chips instead of peanut butter chips. Also did precut the bars before cooling. This helped a great deal as they were like a rock to remove and package up. Had to let them get to room temperature to do so. They were a hit, he did a little jig when he tasted them. That's the greatest affirmation of a job well done.

The ratio of cereal to the peanut butter/corn syrup and white sugar mixture is horrible. I only used 2.5 cups of cereal, but I used the same amount of mixture that is said to use for 7 cups of cereal. It did not cover the entire batch. Also, if you used 7 cups of cereal, it would not fit in a 9x13in pan. I used 2 cups of chocolate chips, and that just barely covered the top of the bars.

One day after stumbling across this, it was rainy and gross and I didn't want to leave the apartment- so I had to make due with no corn syrup and no peanut butter chips. I ended up using yogurt chips and just drizzling them over the top for a "milk and cereal bar" effect (thats a thing, right?)  And i also used honey rather than the corn syrup after searching up a similar recipe- the turn out was incredible! The only thing is they were a bit sweet so next time I'll try it with a less sugary cereal

We have been making these for years. We use 1c sugar, 1 1/2 c karo, and 2 cups PB to a 12 oz box of Special K. They taste way better this way. We also do a 3:1 ratio for chocolate chips to butterscotch chips.

Thanks for a great recipe.  I had bars like this years ago and was looking for the recipe since.  I think the original ones I had used Golden Grahams cereal but the Special K was great too.  Made a wonderful contribution to the bake sale!
