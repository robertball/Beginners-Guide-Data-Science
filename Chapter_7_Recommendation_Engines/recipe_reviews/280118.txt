I tried this recipe. the texture is excellent and I added some oat on top to get extra crunchiness. the only thing that I will change in the future is the amount of sugar in it. this recipe was too sweet for me

This is an amazing recipe - moist, apple-y, perfect pick-me-up. I cut the sugar in the batter (not the crumble) by half to lower the sugar content and it was still great!

Excellent recipe, moist and tasty!  (Next time I’ll half the sugar...just a little sweet for us seniors.)
Thanks for sharing this - it really was special for our Mother’s Day Brunch.

Made it per the recipe, except didn't have regular plain yogurt so I used 50% full fat sour cream and 50% whole milk greek yogurt for that.  Came out SPECTACULAR.  In my oven, however, it needed almost a full 60 minutes for the toothpick to come out clean.

Mom loved it, dad loved it, housemates loved it, and I loved it.  Highly addictive and perfectly balanced.  Mmmmmm

I used minkfruit as the sweetener in the dry ingredients and Swerve for the nut mix. I needed to add about a quarter cup half/half to thin the batter also. My family gobbled it down. This is a keeper.

Made recipe to the T.  Crumb topping started burning halfway through cook time while the inside was still raw.  Ended up cooking it to finish but the topping had to be scraped off.

Another home run dessert by my fave Chef  John! Moist and just sweet enough. Recipe worked very well for me. I added a grating of nutmeg to the dry ingredients.

The apples in the batter helped make this the moistest coffee cake I've ever had. Due to a food allergy, I subbed almonds for the walnuts and it came out great!

This was really good. I did have to make some substitutions based on what was in the pantry. I used flaked almonds instead of walnuts and sour cream instead of yoghurt, but other than that, I followed the recipe as written. The sponge was moist and fluffy, and the crumb was crunchy and sweet. I will definitely be making this again.

This was soo yummy. I used Greek yogurt, honey crisp apples and pecans rather than walnuts. The pan I had was 90 square inches rather than the 80 specified. The 8 pieces I cut were plenty big. Now, I've made my own Mother's Day dessert and Monday morning breakfast.

I had to substitute greek yogurt for the yogurt but it ended up fantastic anyway. The cake itself was fluffy, tender, and moist, with a subtle apple flavor, which were soft without being mushy. 

I loved the walnuts but found the crumble just a hair too sweet overall, while my brother was fine with the sweetness but hated the walnuts. 

The cake, however, doesn't seem to last long, with the moisture from the apples turning the cake soggy after few hours. It's still delicious, but the best time to eat it is definitely the same day it was baked.

Excellent except...

I've never had a 9x12 pan...  All of mine are 9x13 (so weird), so it was hard to spread the batter.  Also, didn't know how to roast the walnuts, so I (stupidly) cut them first, then toasted them, and they burned a bit.   But pretty easy recipe and the family didn't mind the burnt walnut taste too much...

I've cooked other Chef John recipes with tasty results. This coffee cake is another winner. The tips from others were very helpful. I cut back the amount of sugar in the batter to reduce overall sweetness. 

I had to use a 9x13 inch pan. Since one baker said the batter was thick, I evenly spaced large spoonfuls of batter in the pan. It was easier to distribute than one big pile. The cake cooked to perfection in 30 minutes. And, try some before it's fully cooled. It will put a smile in your belly!

My family loved it! I only made one substitution: sour cream for the yogurt. I had the most trouble evenly spreading the thick batter in my 9x13 pan, but the rise durning baking changed my attitude about using a smaller pan in the future. This one is a keeper! Thanks Chef John! (ps, the photo does not do it justice, but it's the best one I had.)

Of course Chef John can make a delicious coffee cake!  The apples kept it moist and the flavor was great.  The moms were all given some from a safe distance and all the thumbs were up.

We added roughly half a cup of old fashioned oats to the top crumble and it turned out amazing.  Served it with a big scoop of ice cream as a dessert or the morning after with a big cup of coffee.  Total win in my book!

I don't see any place for the butter in the dry ingredients as listed. I will try without and follow up later.
Got it! The butter is for the baking dish as my brilliant husband pointed out. Fantastic recipe and the house smells amazing too! Delicious treat. Thanks Chef.

With the amount of sugar crumble topping, I decided to bake it on the middle rack and it came out fine. Like others have mentioned, yes, this recipe has tons of sugar, you can barely taste the cake in my opinion. But that's what recipes are for. Make sure you read it throughly and alter as you go and make notes for next time. I had to scrape off most of the crumble topping but still too sweet for my own preference because of the middle crumble layer. You still rock Chef John Thank! Thank you!

It was FANTASTIC. I forgot to chop up the walnuts so didn't really have a full layer in the center or on top but even so turned out great. Definitely going to be making again, though I might cut back on the amount of sugar a bit to get a stronger apple taste.

I made several changes just based on what I had on hand, but this turned out to delicious! I used olive oil in the cake itself to replace the butter; sour cream in place of yogurt; and toasted pecans instead of walnuts.   This is definitely a keeper!!

Wowza!  That is one might fine Coffee Cake.  I made mine with Pecans, Sour Cream and I have no idea what kind of Apple variety I had on hand, but use what you've got, right?  I also used my 8"x11.5" Pyrex Casserole dish and baked the Cake for 55 minutes, again, that's what I have.  I will say that the Cake had a better texture the next day for Breakfast with Coffee.  That made a lot too, so I shared with the next door neighbors.  I tell ya, this recipe is a keeper!

This cake is one of the best apple-ingredient based ones I've ever had the pleasure to bake!  Thank you Chef John!

And for those who cannot use nuts in the crumble mix, substitute with the equivalent measure of crushed Nilla wafers or graham crackers or digestive biscuits.  Guaranteed to turn out just as delicious!

Loved this coffee cake...Used less sugar in batter and made a gluten free version.Only sorghum in place of wheat flour, with  addition of 1 tsp xanthan gum,also a touch of nutmeg.Ready to take out of the oven after 35 min. Used 9x12 baking dish.Next time must add additional 1/2 a portion of crumble mixture with bit more cinnamon and nutmeg ;)))

This is a great recipe.  Very popular at work.
I added a teaspoon of allspice to the crumble mixture, and only used 3/4 of a cup of white sugar in the wet ingredients.
I used an 8  x 11 1/2 inch glass baking dish, which makes it a little bit thicker - which I like.

Made exactly as written and using the video instructions.  I did use my mixer for the creaming process.  I had to bake this about 15-20 minutes longer than recommended.   I recommend cutting this cake into 16 pieces instead of 6 or 8.

I made this yesterday, and it’s definitely one of the best things I’ve baked. I made a few tweaks to the recipe. Instead of 1c of yogurt, I used 1/4c condensed milk and 3/4c sour cream. Since I did that, I cut the sugar in the batter by about a tablespoon. I replaced the sea salt with Himalayan pink salt (I think it’s a better salt for baking). I also used granny smith apples and pecans.

Delicious!! Super easy to make and even easier to eat the entire thing afterwards. 40 minutes was a little too long for my oven so I’m going to do 35 minutes and then start checking next time. Also, we took out the walnuts because of personal preference. I would either double and make 1.5 times the crumble but otherwise no changes.

The cake itself is a decent recipe. The "crumble" is horrible. It's literally just nuts and sugar. To call this a crumble is ridiculous, but against my better judgement I decided to try it. Just as suspected, it started to burn before the cake was done. Then when the cake WAS done the "crumble" was just loose sugar in some spots, burnt sugar and nuts in others. 

Decided to try again using my personal standard crumble  topping with some pecans in it instead of walnuts and it came out much better. Double checked my oven temp, which was spot on, so decided to bake at 325 convection and had much better results. 

Overall not the worst recipe, but about what I expect from "chef" John.

Amazing recipe! Although all that sugar is not necessary and makes it a bit too sweet for my taste. I used just 1/3 cup brown sugar in the crumble mixture, and 1/2 cup white sugar in the wet ingredients.
