This is a fool proof recipe, but I agree with Vange's suggestions.  This recipe can be very successfully accomplished in a pan with clarified butter.  I like the results better than deepfrying, and the flavor is  so much better.  I might also suggest using eggbread, because it looks so beautiful on the plate when you're finished.  I love strawberry preserves with mine along with the powdered sugar.

I'm not a big grease fan and to some that might be the best part of this sandwich.  I cooked the first two sandwiches according to the recipe.  To no surprise the grease took over the flavor.  As a result, I decided to eliminate the grease for the rest and lightly coated the pan. I cooked it like I would a grilled cheese.  The sandwich was DELICIOUS and my mind was put at ease b/c I was not clogging my arteries.  I also used Hawaiian Bread and dipped them in blackberry jelly.

Excellent sandwich for students to make with extra stuff lying around the house. Subed Old Cheddar for Swiss and fried it in a pan with just a little margarine, like french toast. Absolutely amazing.

I was very curious about this sandwich so decided to make it for dinner. My husband and I with raised brows took our first bite and were pleasantly surprised. Again with curiousity we tried our next bites with strawberry jam. Very tasty! But I honestly don't think I'll make it again unless I happen to have some odd reason to gain weight. I just can't justify eating a batter dipped sandwich. Hubby thought we should have deep fried candy bars with it, hehe. Good recipe but not worth the calories.

I made this the other night when we were low on groceries.......what a pleasant surprise.....This was awesome!!!!  It tasted just like the one at Bennigan's.  I left out the ham since I didn't have any, and subbed American cheese since thats what I had, and doubled the batter as other reviewers suggested.  I couldn't find my FryDaddy, so I pan-fried it in a deep skillet in about an inch of oil........worked perfectly!!  I served with Brandied Blackberry Preserves and it was delicious!  Thanks for a cheap and easy recipe to add to the rotation!

You can make these bit size if you take one piece of bread, cut the crust off, and roll flat with a rolling pin.  Layer on a slice of cheese, turkey, and ham and then roll up.  Secure with four toothpicks, spaced evenly, and cut into 4 pieces.  You dip the pieces individually in the batter and fry them up.  They were so cute!

So many reviews include ways to change this sandwich because of it being deep fried.  Please don't; this is what the sandwich is.  If you want to do it differently, create a recipe making a sandwich the way you like it, but don't go telling people how to change it to make it taste worse.  Oh yeah, another thing... no one cares what you think or hour husband thinks or your dog thinks... it's not about YOU; get over yourself!

Perfect!  I used jalapeno Monterey Jack instead of Swiss.  One user commented it was hard to keep the sandwich together, so I inserted the toothpicks at such an angle to the bread, that they were barely sticking out.  This held together much more securely than just inserting it straight through.  Berry jam is a must w/ this.  (oh, and I also heated my oil to 400 as someone else suggested....Perfect!)

I made these for dinner last night and wow heart attack heaven!   The batter needs to be doubled if you plan to make the whole amount.  My kids and husband liked this but we all agreed it was really to oily and heavy. We could each only eat 1/4 of the sandwich and we felt pretty lethargic from it.

Making this recipe was my first experience with monte cristo sandwiches, and they were delicious! Surprisingly, they also reheat very well, even in the microwave.

I decided to be daring and make the recipe exactly as written but grill on a Foreman Grill to reduce the grease.  It wasn't greasy but the bread dried out.

IT'S DELICIOUS!  Do not bother with other Monte Cristo recipes unless they're deep fried like this.  (I know it's not the healthiest, but hey, if you want healthy, eat a salad.) The only change I would make is to add a bit more ham & turkey to each sandwich.  Also, it's just not complete without a side of seedless red raspberry jam for dipping. YUM!

An absolutely perfect sandwich, great with strawberry preserves. I'm really amused by those who complain about the grease. I actually keep track of the grease that is soaked up by different foods, and this one soaked up a whole lot less that french fries or okra. Even 90% of cake recipes call for 1/2 cup of some kind of fat. I prefer to indulge every once in a while, and get plenty of exercise.
Awesome recipe for that "once in a while" treat.

thought this was a great sandwich  -  I have had many Monte Cristo's, and this is one of the best.  My only suggestion is to make sure your oil is at least 365 degrees before frying or else they will be oily, and also drain on paper towels before serving.

I have also served these at a heavy "snack" party  -  you can make them early in the day, and re-heat in a hot oven for about 5 minutes -  they will puff, and be gooey

I had my first Monte Cristo sandwich at a local restaurant and just loved it. Since then, I have been searching for a recipe that was as close to that same sandwich as I could get, and I believe I found it. Some other recipes suggest just dipping your sandwich in a milk/egg mixture and grilling like french toast, but I believe the batter and the frying is part of what makes this so delicious. For anyone worried about the oily greasy flavor, I used butter flavored Crisco and then laid them out on a paper towel to soak up the excess grease. They turned out delicious! We made these for a family birthday dinner and they were a hit with EVERYONE (from the little kids to the older adults). We served ours with powdered sugar and drizzled with raspberry preserves.

I also diluted the batter just a little to make it easier to use. After dipping the sandwich in batter, I coated them with dry bread crumbs on all sides.  Made them easier to handle and they came out of the fryer with a nice crispy coating.  The kids loved them.

Great recipe, and my sons asked me when I would be making this again!  I did substitute milk for the water, added some extra meat, and a dash of vanilla to the batter.

I had never eaten a Monte Cristo Sandwich.  I had seen them on the menu in restaurants but, I was afraid to order one in case it was a bust.  When I saw this recipe I had to try it.  My son & oldest grandangel were here and they said it was a great Monte Cristo.  I did not cut the sandwiches until they were cooked and ready to serve.  I fried them in my cast iron skillet with about 1 to 1 1/2" of oil.  I sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with jam.  They were truly great!!  I have made them several times since and always make extra for the next day.  We think they are better the next day heated in the microwave for a few seconds.  Tried making with graham cracker crumbs as one reviewer suggested.  It did not work well at all.  Will only make the Real One from now on.  Followed the directions and it made 4 sandwiches nicely with a little mix left over that I poured in the hot oil to make a funnel cake.  THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE!!!

I've made this recipe a couple of times now.  Everyone loves it just the way it is!  The kids ask for it as their special birthday dinner & my neighbor keeps asking me when I'm making them again so she can come over for a bite.
She said she's tried other Monte Cristo Sandwiches at restaurants and none come close to being as delicious as mine ~ THANK YOU so much for this recipe!

One trick that I found, wrap the sandwich tightly in plastic wrap over night. It makes sure it sets while frying.

You don't have to deep fry this sandwich!  I fried in a non-stick pan with a little veg. oil and butter.  Put the toothpick all the way through at an angle before battering & let some of the batter drip off before frying.  Turned to cook all sides.  I used regular bread and didn't have Swiss so used American (I know....).  Swiss would have been even better, but this was an excellent sandwich, if you like Monte Cristo's!!  Dusted lightly with powdered sugar.  Heated raspberry jam, strained the seeds and used to drizzle on each bite.  Could only eat half but will reheat the other half later :O) !!  Used to love Bennigan's :O( - Friday's has one they deep fry - I don't like it.

This is a very good recipe.  But not the kind that I like.  When we made it at work, we make the sandwiches with american, swiss, turkey and ham.  We also make them a day in advance and wrap each tightly in cling wrap and then wrap them all together.  This will help them stay together when frying.  You could also do this a couple hours before frying.  Then we dip them in egg and then in grahm crackers. Gives it a wonderful sweet crust and makes it very crispy.  Finally cut them in half before serving.  Alot more work yes but well worth it in my opinion

Thanks so much for this recipe! Monte cristo has been one of my favorite sandwiches for a years but I didn't have a good recipe til now. Yes it's very heavy, that's why I only indulge once or twice a year!! The only change I made was to saute this in butter (using clarified butter) instead of oil. My family loved this treat for dinner. I served with a nice light fruit salad to offset the clogging of the arteries...LOL Try this once and you won't be disappointed!

I used to LOVE these sandwiches years ago!!!  Bennigan's used to sell them. Then I was diagnosed with Celiac disease and have not had one in years.  Made them tonight with my gluten free flour and they were fantastic!!!  So glad to have them again.  Good recipe for gluten free too.

The batter could not be more perfect.  One exception was that we used vegetarian deli "meats" as a substitute, which makes the whole thing a little lighter and better for you.  Enjoy with a variety of jams/preserves.

O MY this was just what I wanted, couldnt not be better. and yes we did fry them in oil about 3 inchees deep at  380# degrees I cut the sandwiched just in half and stuch in 1 toothpick in a angle . My husband cokked them and just kept turning them till done. did not have powered sugar , but did use raspberry per with the seeds on them. even my 7 year old loved it. will only make once in a while because of the calorie count , but defintly worth it to try.. LOVED THEM

I made this for breakfast today.  These were delicious.  I followed the recipe except for the deep fry part.  I skillet fried them and I am sure they were just as delicious.  We used maple syrup as a dipping, too.  A winner in my house.

Wow!  Never made or had these before.  My husband asked for these & said they were just as good or better then he has had.  Probably will only be for a special brunch now & then, since they are deep fried w/ham, cheese, batter..etc....but, worth for a special treat.  I doubled the batter to make 6 large sandwiches. I used a loaf of fresh Itlian bread you find in the deli & cut into large slices.  Basically by the time I put the cheese and meat on the slices the toothpick fit perfectly.  I did not quarter them & my swiss cheese didn't melt on the inside, but, no one complained--just raves.  My kids would only eat them with the powder sugar (and loved them), BUT, DON'T miss using the current jelly sauce as mentioned by the submitter--actually I used rasberry since that is what I happen to have---husband and I agreed that final touch made the sandwich.

This recipe is restaurant quality, possibly even better.  Make sure you cut the crusts off the bread first.  Wheat bread works just as well, and we used genoa salami and American cheese as well as the turkey and swiss.  This was so good!  Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely wonderful.  I fell in love with the Monte Cristo as a child in some cafe in the old Opryland theme park in Nashville.  Nearly 40 years later I can say that this is the best I've had. And not too difficult to make.  Thanks a ton!

I thought this was pretty good, but the batter needed something...(besides the baking power which I forgot!).  I served with some strawberry jam mixed with cream. I think I'll add a pinch of cinnamon and a little vanilla next time.  However, my finicky eater asked me to make these again (which should automatically warrant five stars) and floored me when she even suggested I serve to the kids for snacking at Easter dinner.

Am not a fan of mixed meat nor of egg, but I remember this being my favorite sandwich of all time from childhood jaunts to Disneyland and that Pirates of the Caribbean restaurant.  This recipe teleported me directly back to that time and place. Wow. Used Crisco oil for frying and the crust came out crispy and flaky. Made this for a group of Europeans who had never even heard of a Monte Cristo. Resounding applause from all. Will make again -- but rarely. This thing in a calorie bomb waiting to explode! But worth it, so worth it.

Fantastic! I made this exactly according to the recipe and it turned out so well. Very delicious. These were the best Monte Cristos I have had since Bennigan's closed down. Truly fabulous! I recommend placing the cooked sandwiches on a plate layered with paper towels so the hot oil will be absorbed. They were crispy and delicious and perfect! I enjoyed eating them with raspberry jam.

I make a special brunch every Sunday for my husband.  I made these for the first time.  My husband loved them. I didn't care for them at all. Too much batter and grease for my taste. However, I might try the suggestion of cooking them like a cheese sandwich to avoid all the grease next time. So, a big hit as far as my husband was concerned and a big miss from my perspective.

Just like I remembered!  LOVE these!  They were a bit on the greasier side than they should be, though.  Possibly my frybaby wasn't hot enough.  The title doesn't lie - these are the real thing.

I loved this sandwich. I did not deep fry mine though. I dipped in the egg mixture and cooked like french toast or grilled cheese. I also dipped my sandwich in strawberry jam. Oh so good!!

UGGH. I had never had a monte cristo sandwich before, but it sounded tasty and the reviews were great so i gave it a try. It did not taste good. I usually dont eat deep fried foods often, maybe thats why, but this was horrible for me. Sorry but i will never try this again. :(

Tastes just like I remember it from the restaurant. Very easy, however, I was only able to do 9 quarters of a sandwich with the egg batter. This was perfect for my family, but if you need more, i would double the batter.

Very, Very good!  I have been looking for a recipe like this!  Better than the grilled sandwiches.  I heated the oil to 400 degrees since the sandwiches are large and tend to make the oil drop a few degree when they are fried.  DO NOT SUBSTITUTE baking soda for the powder!

I have made Monte Cristo's using this recipe many many times and everyone who tastes this delicious sandwich wants the recipe! You really can't go wrong if you are looking for the authentic Monte Cristo taste. Just remember to make sure the oil for frying is hot enough! If it's not, you'll end up marinating your sandwich in unhealthy oil.

Of course when cooking something like this, you're not doing it to be healthy. It's all about taste and reliving that savory moment which brought you to this recipe. With that being said, I used three slices of each meat... and it was like I was at the restaurant. Every bite just urged me to want to cram in one bite after another.

Yummy! Made these for a quick lunch today. My fiance and I had no errands to run (we were both off on Friday and have the Labor Day holiday to get things done). Because we weren't "out and about," I made a home cooked meal. My fiance never tried a Monte Cristo before, so he didn't know what to expect.... Leary of the traditional powdered sugar "dusting" and jam / dipping sauce, I served his plain, but for me, I went all out lol! This reminds me EXACTLY of Bennigan's Monte Cristo sandwich (I am SOOO happy to find this recipe on here, especially since all of the Bennigan's around me closed). Since I was only cooking for two, I made one sandwich, cut into quarters (these deep fry better when they're smaller). A half sandwich is the perfect serving size for one person. Because of the heavy batter, these fry up BIG and fill you up very quickly! I pretty much followed SEAWAKIM's directions to the letter except for adding more meat and an extra slice of Swiss cheese (you just can't have enough, IMHO!). I also lightly spread a mixture of dijon mustard / mayo on each slice of bread (be careful tho, too much will make your bread soggy). I think next time, I'll use Hawaiian or egg bread since my fiance wasn't crazy about plain 'ol white bread. Served with heated raspberry preserves and T's sweet potato fries, this hit the spot. Due to the mess factor, I'm not sure how often I'll make these, but I will on occasion for sure. Thanks SEAWAKIM! :-)

I made these for dinner tonight and my kids just loved them and so did I. It turned out exactly as I expected. I get so annoyed with bad reviews based on fat and calorie content you should know by looking this isn't healthy. Things like this are meant to be a treat not a daily meal and as such was perfect as cross between a sandwich and a donut lol. I fried mine in about an inch of oil and flipped quickly to get all the batter cooking.

Delicious!  There's no need to deep fat fry. ^_~ I used 2 Tbsp butter and 2 Tbsp vegetable oil in a skillet and dipped the sandwiches in the batter with my fingers instead of using toothpicks.

This recipe has replaced my own personal concoction.  Now even my husband, who once thought this sandwich was "weird", loves when these are for dinner. We live very rural, so we use raspberry jam, heated, for the dipping sauce most of the time.

I ALWAYS use the box of Tempura batter to make my Monte Cristo's and it is much better than basic batter!

This is the real one. It's perfect.  Most recipes for a monte christo are nothing more than a sandwich with french toast like bread and this one is truly breaded.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  They're just like I remember having at Bennigan's restaurant!  Husband LOVED them and the recipe is a keeper!!

I t was excellent. My family and I had just had a Monte Cristo at Disneyland and we were not impressed. I came home and looked this recipe up and made some. My famoly raved over the sandwich.  It gets an A+ from my family and I.

These were delicious. My 7 year old twins loved them so much, that they  wanted me to send them some for lunch at school the next day! I used turkey and beef bolony instead, and cheddar cheese. Added a bit of water to loosen up the batter a little. I shallow fried them and placed the fried pieces on paper towels to drain excess oil. Came out awesome!

Tastes just like the one I used to get in Nevada! The entire family loved it, including my mother-in-law (who is a GREAT cook herself). I used peanut oil in my deep fryer, which helped to keep it from burning too easily, and served pasta salad along side. I think those who seem concerned about the greasiness or fatty content of this dish should look elsewhere anyway. What did they expect for something battered and deep-fried! Serve a green salad instead. We will definitely have this again.

This was FANTASTIC!  I thought it was almost exactly like Bennigan's famous Monte Cristo, although the hubby thought there was "something different" (I think it was the brand of ham/turkey that I used).  I followed the recipe to a T, deep fried it, and served it up with some powdered sugar and raspberry jam/preserves.  Talk about good!  My only problem was that by the third sandwich, I was scraping the bottom of the bowl for the batter, so I would probably double the batter mixture next time (luckily, I was only making three sandwiches).

Reminded me of the Monte Cristos I would have at the Northstar Hotel in downtown Minneapolis many decades ago.  Next time I do them, though, I will keep the sandwich whole and cut after frying....the quartered pieces had a tendency to fall apart even though I used 2 toothpicks in some of the quarters.  Otherwise, the flavor was there...the consistency was good...all in all a wonderful Monte Cristo.  Am OK with the grease since it is not something I eat (lot of grease in anything) on a regular basis. Once a year is not going to cause a heart attack:)

Wonderful sandwich! I used my homemade jalapeño jelly for dipping. It added some zing without taking away from the meat and cheese center. I will make this again for sure, just not on a regular basis-it's a great treat!

Very good.  The family and guests liked them.  Definitely weren't fancy like the restaurant ones, but I cooked in a little oil and butter.  Took a lot of hands for a large batch.  Needed 4x the batter for 15 whole sandwiches.

Yummy!  Family of 5 enjoyed them, however; they were HUGE and too much grease.  Made the serving for 8 and our family of 5 only ate 1/4 of the sandwich.  Will make like the grill cheese way next time to see who the family likes them.  Would make again, but not anytime soon...gotta work these off first. :o)

Delicious! I was alone with my grandma and we wanted something a little more interesting than plain pasta or pizza. When I suggested this my grandma was like cheering. This was so easy to make! The ingredients are ones that you usually have around the house, so you don't have to make a special trip to the grocery store for ingredients. If you want to try something new and interesting for lunch or dinner I suggest this!

Pretty tasty. I pan fried the sandwiches. Next time, I think I will double bread the sandwiches. Also, served with Strawberry Rhubarb Jam, Plum Preserve, and Lingonberry Preserve. Lingonberry tasted the best. Also, I might try a Currant sauce next time.

I gave this 3 stars because despite my great love for them the nutritional information given with the recipe is completely off... I used three other calorie counters and the total calories were around 1,100 with barely any nutritional value... don't be fooled this sandwich packs a punch!

I know it sounds nasty, but if you want to avoid a "fried" flavor, fry the sandwiches in shortening. There won't be any trace of oily/fried taste (and it won't stink up your house). We made two sandwiches and needed more batter than the recipe made, so we had to whip up more while the second batch of sandwich quarters were frying. I was a little concerned that the bread or batter would absorb a lot of oil, but they barely absorbed any as long as the temperature was maintained (we fried ours at around 380 degrees). This was AWESOME as an occasional treat, really close to the restaurant version.

It was fun to find this recipe! My husband loves these. We affectionately call this the Monte Crisco.  Using regular sandwich bread, I basically combined 2 sandwiches (bread, turkey, cheese, ham, bread, repeat).  To help keep the sandwiches together I pressed them flat and put them in the fridge under a heavy plate for an hour. Then inserted toothpicks at a 45 degree angle.  We serve ours with honey, and we really enjoy these as a rare treat.

great recipe! my husband loves and misses the monte cristo he used to order at bennigans and was so excited when he saw i was making this. he said it tasted JUST like the original...maybe even better because i made it. ; ) next time i will double the meat and cheese just to making it more filling. other than that it was amazing!! i don't have a deep fryer so i just cooked it in vegetable oil on the stove top. i used about an inch or so of oil and turned it every couple seconds. yummmmmmmy!!!

This is what I was craving....a Monte Cristo that tasted like the Bennigan's version. You really do have to watch your frying tempeture and time though. I used King's Hawiiaan Bread for this and they were delicious.

Yes. That is pretty much the one you get at Bennigans. Excellent. I used a deep fryer and followed the recipe. This is a deep fryed sandwich severed with jelly and powdered sugar. It is going to be high in calories. Its a once a year food but really great.

Our first Monte Cristo Sandwich so it wouldn't be fair to comparatvely rate this, but for the first one we've had it was okay, not bad at all. Not a true family favorite for all the members of my family, but enjoyed by most and easy to prepare. I wonder how much better this would taste if you spiced up the flour batter a bit and/or used seasoned (flour based) fry (like cajun chicken fry by zatarains)..We might try it like this one day. :-)

I used a frying pan instead of a deep fryer, which made this a little more difficult (some of the sides were a little undercooked) but this was still a great recipe, and the sandwiches tasted great.

First time I tried one of these was many years ago in California at a Marie Calendar's and loved them.  The deep fried method is how they made them and your recipe here is excellent.  It is great with the strawberry preserves or any of the simply fruit type of jams.

So, I made the exact recipe and also changed one small thing and made it with the change. The only thing I changed and tried was adding a piece of bread in the center. So there were three slices in the sandwich. Other then that everything was the same. The were great both ways. It was the best Monte Cristo I have ever made. I used real turkey carved off a turkey breast. I also used a roasted chipole raspberry jam for dipping. It was very flavorable and i couldn' stop eating it. Must try for those that love Monte Cristo sandwiches.

After reading the reviews, I wasn't sure if I'd think this was too greasy, or if I should fry it in a skillet like french toast, as some people suggested. But I really liked how these turned out, and I liked that they reminded me of restaurant style Monte Cristo sandwiches. I made mine with hawaiian rolls, as someone else did, and I just used blackberry jam that I had, which was perfect.

We make this as one of the many turkey reprisals that follow a large turkey dinner :)  Very good, definitely not something I make often as it is super fatty, but it really is a nice indulgence around the holidays.  Very simple recipe, I always find I need more batter though.

This was awesome!  My kids loved it and have already requested I make it again.  I doubled the batter recipe and doubled the meat in the sandwich.  I also used cheddar because that is what I had on hand.  Will try with Swiss next time.  We ate it with red currant jam on the side.

These taste awesome, but I have a few problems with the recipe. First, I needed to double the batter to have enough to cover all 16 mini-sandwiches. Second, and the most bothersome: unless you have an industrial sized, restaurant model deep fryer, you will need to work in small batches to fry these all up, which means that dinner is NOT on the table in 15 minutes. My "quick, easy, hard day dinner" took me over an hour.  We still really liked the results, but lesson learned.

This recipe is FABULOUS,my family and I found it to be BETTER than Bennigans. not as greasy. One tip....I prepared my sandwiches and added mustard to them, and a touch of mayo. And used a sandiwch maker to SEAL THE SANDWICH ALL AROUND. THEN deep fried them. NO GREASE got inside, and it was not greasy at all.....I think if the sides were not sealed it would make for a greasy mess!!!! FABULOUS recipe! LOVED it!

I've never really liked Monte Cristo Sandwiches from restaurants, my mom and brother always loved them. However I absolutely love this recipe. These sandwiches are devine! We deep fried them in our fry daddy and they came out wonderfully.

Great recipe, but like other comment, we don't eat a lot of fried foods and tho the grease was extremely hot,the grease soaked up so much in the bread we all got very ill, I will have to try again and do as they suggested and just coat the pan and try, that takes from the deep fried monte cristo, but don't want to repeat another night like that.

I've done this 2 ways now: the first way involves cooking the sandwich in butter like a grilled cheese. The second involves battering the sandwiches, and then grilling them up in butter like French toast. I'm not sure which I prefer honestly, both ways were very tasty. It probably depends on how much time I have as the eggy way takes a bit more effort (but still not much, honestly, it's a French toasted sandwich). I can't speak to the original cooking method but as for the flavor, this is great, and so is the batter. I wouldn't want to eat it often as it's truly, truly, truly bad for you--but for a once in awhile thing, it's very tasty! PS We like this one best with pepper jack or with pepper jelly! Spicy AND sweet together is to die for!

This sandwich is to die for!  I loved it made exactly like the recipe said.  However, it is so versatile and can be made with whatever you have on hand.  Any kind of bread, meat, and cheese.  And, since we are on a tight budget, it was a nice, inexpensive meal.  Thanks!

My husband and I really enjoyed these. We doubled both the batter and the meat. I didn't have any jams or jellies that would go well with this, so we skipped the powdered sugar, and had honey mustard instead. We had "Green Banana Fries" from this site with this and they complimented each other well. Thanks for sharing.

So good! All different meats and cheeses are great.  We dust with powdered sugar and dip in grape jam.  :) The breading reminds me of funnel cake.

I love Monte Cristo sandwiches in the restaurants, so I wanted to give them a try at home.  This didn't turn out well at all for me.  They came apart in the fryer and even when I managed to keep some together they just didn't have a lot of flavor except the grease flavor from cooking.  My kids hated them!

very easy to assemble and it just gets easier and more tempting from there :o) make sure oil is at or very cloese to recommended temp, want the center warm and cheese to 'ooze' but you don't want it to burn

Very good, filling sandwich.  I used the Amish White Bread I made earlier for this.  I pan fried the sandwich, and it worked very well for me.  (I just couldn't justify all the oil for two sandwiches.)  Boyfriend who never had a Monte Cristo before this, requested that we make this one again!

I added just a bit of water to the batter as it was so thick.  I also make mine with a slice of cheddar in addition to the swiss cheese.

Sinfully good! Easy to make too. I will make again, and change the meat/cheese combination. I imagine anything would be good.

I tried out this recipe since it was past closing time, and this definitely hit the spot.  I'm a little slow & don't have a deep fryer, so it took me a little longer to get all of this together -- used colby jack and about 4 slices of thin-cut turkey & ham, served with raspberry preserves. Great!

I didn't think these were very good, my husband thought they were just OK. The batter did turn out light and crispy, but inside the sandwich seemed to be    greasy. Maybe the oil needs to be hotter so it does not soak up so much grease.

I loved these, but i changed the batter. I used two eggs, and milk so it was a lighter texture.  I used turkey strips and the cheese togethor, and it tasted great! Will definatly make again!

My bf liked this much better than I did.  It wasn't quite what I'd tasted before, but it was pretty good.  The next time I want to make Monte Cristo sandwiches I'll likely use this recipe again.

This was good. I only gave 4 stars because the batter was too thin. I thought it should be thick like corn dog batter so you can't see the sandwich through the batter.

Delicious! Just like the restaurants. I like to serve mine with blackberry or raspberry jam on the side. Next time I make it, I’ll blend the batter with spinach; you can’t taste it and it adds nutrients.

Personally, it didn't taste better than a regular sandwich. Plus, the powdered sugar on meat was a strange taste that I'd prefer not to try again.

My husband was craving a Monte Cristo sandwich and I'd never had one.  WOW!  This recipe was terrific.  I followed the recipe ingredients as written - except I doubled the batter based on another reviewer's comment.    I also fried my sandwiches in butter rather than oil.  Delicious!  Next time I'll try frying in oil to get that perfect, golden crust.  Thank you for the recipe.

Made this tonight mostly according to recipe and loved it.  We used raspberry preserves for dipping.  I used 2 sliced turkey, 2 slices Swiss and one slice ham.  Loved the melted cheese!  I fried in the skillet with vegetable oil.   Will make it exactly the same way next time.

To all the cry babies mad about calories or it being deep fried, don’t make it. We always use this recipe but we fry it in butter, otherwise we don’t change anything, and the reason we did butter was we didn’t have any oil, but it’s delicious! So we just continue to use butter instead of oil. We use a raspberry jalapeño jam that I make and it’s sooooo good!

I doubled the meat on this recipe, but the ratio of bread/batter to meat/cheese still seemed off. Also, I had to use three toothpicks per quarter, and they still tried to come apart while deep-frying. The flavor was OK, but they were a little greasy. The kids used grape jelly rather than currant, and they seemed to like it. I have another Monte Cristo recipe that involves pan-frying in butter, and I like it better than this recipe.

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS! Made it exactly as written, deep fried in the fryer. Took me right back to Disneyland. I used chipotle turkey because it was what I had and served with peach jam again because it was what I had. This was my husband's first time having a Monte Cristo sandwich and he loved it. Definitely a keeper and will make again, many times....

After reading the reviews I made a few changes to the recipe. When making the batter I added 1/8 tsp. of cinnamon and about half as much nutmeg. I always have that on my French toast. I also used potato bread instead of white bread. I decided to cook them on my griddle instead of frying them. I added a pat of butter prior to placing the sandwich on the griddle to give it a beautiful golden color and add flavor. I served with raspberry preserves. My family gobbled it up and they asked for seconds (even my picky eater!)

So excellent!  I used to work at Disney World and at the Town Square Restaurant I worked at, this amazing sandwich was on the menu.  Having not eaten one for 45 years, this recipe came amazingly close to the one I remember. I served seedless raspberry preserves for dipping after a dusting of confectioners sugar. Pure heaven!

Super easy to do. I doubled the batter so it needs to be a little bit thinner (maybe 3/4 water instead of 2/3 c?). 1/2 of the 4 sandwiches didn't get cooked but I used Texas Toast bread. Good flavor on the batter... Instead of quarters I cut the sandwichs in half. Used 2 ham, 2 cheese and 2 turkey slices. Ran the heat on the oil at 380, turning sandwiches every 15-20 secs to brown. NOT greasy! Served with a cranberry/cherry walnut chutney and hubby had his with maple syrup. Yum!

I doubled up on the meat, more like a restaurant. Also used crisco instead of oil, a little lighter.

YUM! I made this with the smallest bit of EVOO instead of a quart of oil. At least I felt less guilty eating it.

This was a great recipe and I agree that it was like Bennigan's which no longer is in business where I live.  At the restaurant they served it was raspberry jelly.  So that's what I ate mine with and it's was great.  My children loved it too.  With the left over batter I even made some deep fried mushrooms.  I know that this isn't the healthiest but I figured if you're not eating it everyday.  Once in a while won't hurt you.

My husband and I liked it, but my toddlers did not. My 5-year old asked for a "regular" ham and cheese sandwich instead and my 3-year old only picked the ham out of it. I personally would give it 3.5 stars, but I don't think I'll make it again since the kids didn't like the combination of sweet and savory together.

Tasty. I opted to do this "grilled cheese style" instead of deep-frying. I used processed cheese slices and all deli ham. Forgot the pepper. I know many liked to dip this in jam, but since I wanted less mess and was serving this to my toddler (I know, not healthy but he loves grilled cheese and this was a treat) I spread some jam (strawberry for him, sour cherry for me) on one slice of the bread. Didn't have any powdered sugar so I had to omit that. I did use paper towels to get as much grease as I could out of the sandwiches before serving.

YUM! great recipe! My mom used to love these and turned me onto them when I was a kid. I never can seem to find them on menues where i live. This one fit the bill. I also substituted 1/2 & 1/2 for water and it was perfect. Served with powdered sugar and seedless raspberry jam. NOM NOM NOM

I used 1" of olive oil in a small frying pan, on a stove set to medium heat. No toothpicks were on hand, but with careful handling of the sandwiches, I didn't need any. I don't have any currant jelly so I used strawberry preserves.

I LOVE Monte Cristo sandwiches! I can't believe I hadn't tried them until now, but I will say that this has found a permanent home in my recipe box.

Absolutely delicious! Tastes just like the Bennigan's version. I used two slices of honey wheat bread, swiss and chedder cheese with turkey. I prepared exactly as directed only I added mayo on each slice in the sandwich and it was sooo good. My two year old gobbled it up. Thanks.

Wow. I used to get this at Bennigans all the time. This tasted just like it!     The batter heavily coats 3 sandwiches. I used american and a little cheddar cheese. I heated the oil in a med sauce pan, about 3 inches. Using tongs, lowered the sandwich in and turned it halfway through cooking. I skipped the powdered sugar and dipped it in honey dijion!! Best sandwich ever! Next time I might try it with fresh french bread.

This is a great recipe. The batter is delicious. I halved the recipe and still used a whole egg and it turned out perfectly. Definately cook this is ghee or clarified butter. I wouldn't dream of cooking it any other way.

I first made this sandwich with French toast (egg bread), and I cooked/fried it in a non-stick pan with butter. It was too soft. Tonight, I deep fried the sandwich in oil, and I was more satisfied with the crunchy, harder feel and fat taste.  I used raspberry preserves on the side, french fries, and a pickle. I rarely eat fried foods, but doing this once a year may not hurt. It tasted like the one Bennigan's made. Of course, in our area of Houston and Victoria, TX, we no longer have Bennigans. I think they're all closed.

all messiness aside... this is the best!  I have four young picky eaters with lots of picky eating friends. It's always a hit! We don't care for swiss, we use jack. I've tried monte cristos at resturants that don't come close to this. Again this is messy, but worth the clean up!!

I love this sandwich, I lived in Florida where places had this on the menu- now im in Nashville and cannot find it anywhere. This was as close to the real recipe that ive made. I always use 3 slices of bread like a club sandwich to keep the meat and cheese seperate. Dip it in rasberry preserves. I would eat this every day if it wasnt so bad for you.

I have made these twice - they are my favorite. I always add more meat and cheese to the sandwhiches and this time I had it with Cranberry Orange dipping sauce (found on this site). Wonderful flavor mix to the sandwhich!

Very simple and very tasty.  Picture was very helpful to determine if I would like to try the recipe.  Ever since Disneyland, have been trying to find recipe that could simulate the Blue Bayou.  Not yet, but getting close.

This was my first monte cristo sandwich ever so I don't really have anything to compare it with. It was good, everyone in the family enjoyed it and said that it was a nice change from the normal plain turkey sandwich. I will make this again, it was good!

This was GREAT!
I added american cheese to them as well, and I grilled them in a skillet with butter instead of frying them. they are fatty enough without the frying. we ate them with honey mustard too, it complimented the sweet and savory flavors. They were incredible!

I actually REALLY liked this.  We used wheat bread.  It is VERY filling.  We don't eat fried foods much at all, and my family of 2 adults, and two small children split 2 sandwiches between us.  Oh, and the batter was barely enough to cover the 2 sandwiches.  We dipped in strawberry and apricot jam.

Double the batter as suggested by another reviewer.  I use wooden BBQ skewers cut into thirds instead of toothpicks, which were too short to use adequately.  I made one sandwich with hard salami, turkey, and cheddar cheese, and they were excellent.  The ham, turkey and swiss sandwiches were also very good.  Don't serve this with other fried foods -- I served homemade French fries and it was just too much oil for one meal.  I think the best way to describe this sandwich is that it's a fun novelty to say you tried once.  It came out exactly as we expected, but I don't think we'll do it again.

This was very good! The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars was because my batter stuck to my deep fryer basket, making it very hard to turn the sandwiches!  Great taste, though. I served it with the Caesar Salad Supreme from this site.  I also had Red Raspberry Seedless Jam as the dipping sauce.  Will definitely make again!

If these hadn't made such a mess cooking them I would have given this 5 stars.  I LOVED these.  Never had a Monte Cristo before, but was intrigued by it.  Way to fatty to have very often, but what a decadent treat!  Only changes was to use multi-gran bread (it's what we keep on hand) and to double the batter (had some left over - might try only doing 1/2 again as much next time).  We dipped in seedless raspberry preserves.

This recipe was super easy!  I made it for my daughter and she was begging me for more.  She wants me to make it every night.

w0w! This was great and ridiculously easy to make. It didn't take any hardcore measuring and I can't wait to make these for other people. My family loved it.

This was so good.  Subed, sharp cheddar and colby jack for the cheese.  Don't care for swiss.

I tried this out on friends at a New Year's brunch.  It got rave reviews.  It's easy, too.

This is my favorite sandwich and it was down right delicious.  My husband loved it too.  He ate his with syrup and I had jelly.  I like it also with a side of raspberry jam for dipping.  This is a hit in my house.

This recipe is great!  I would not cook this all of the time but it is great for something different!  I doubled the batter like one of the others suggested and it was perfect.
my daughter who can kindof be a picky eater loved this.

I thought this was super easy and delicious. It is different and was extremely well received at a ladies brunch. I am keeping this one in the file. I did not serve this with a currant sauce but a few ladies said that raspberry sauce is excellent with it as well.
