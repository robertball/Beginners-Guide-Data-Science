Made this for my dad. He loved it! He couldn't get enough!! I wanted more color so I added tomatoes and cucumbers and it still was phenomenal. I highly recommend this recipe if you're looking for a healthy side dish!

I didn't have basil or parsley so I substituted dill. Turned out great.

All I can say is YUM! Next time am going to switch out the basil with cilantro just for fun :-) Thank you, Judi!

This was an absolute 5 star dish after adding some salt, pepper, and crushed red pepper. I also switched out basil for cilantro (my own preference) and added some cucumber for crunch. Delicious! Thank you for sharing!

Made this recipe tonight. Replaced basil with cilantro (only because I love the taste) and added chopped green onions (because they were taking up space in the fridge). Delicious!!!! I had a difficult time waiting for it to chill for 2 hours before eating it!

Based on what was in my kitchen, I used cilantro instead of basil and lime instead of lemon juice.  I also used a small can of both garbanzo and black beans.  I only used a couple of spoonfuls of Parmesan cheese for flavor.  Very easy, tasty, healthful dish.

Super easy and pretty tasty!  I had two cans of chickpeas that I didn't know what to do with, and this is what I tried.  I think it was a great call and it made a good side compliment to my lunch.  I think I'd even make it again, even though I'm not a huge chickpea fan.  Plus I used dried parsley...and it was still good!

A tasty way to enjoy chick peas.  I only used 1/2 the dried spices with the full can of beans. Also added chopped cucumber and finely chopped lettuce.

Delicious! Didn't have the fresh herbsâ€¦ garlic powder works great. High in fiber and super healthy. Thank you for this recipe!

Tastes great! I made this with tomatoes but however due to a mistake (I didn't know I had to cook the chickpeas after soaking) I ended up having to put the entire finished chickpea salad in chicken broth (plus half a cube of boullion) and boil for 90 minutes. It tasted so good my husband wanted it for the next three days!

This is a simple salad with simple tastes. Letting it sit for an hour or two is critical to melding the flavors.  My husband wasn't so sure he liked it, but it grew on him as he ate more.  It is very versatile, and I think by the addition of just a couple of ingredients it could be much better. Next time, I would add tomato, scallion, and maybe some peppers.  You could make this more Greek with changing the cheese to feta and the basil to oregano, and adding red onion.  You could make this Mexican by changing the cheese to cotija, the lemon to lime, and the basil to cilantro.  Or you could make this Asian by skipping the cheese, changing the lemon to orange, the basil to cilantro, and adding some ginger and soy sauce (maybe even swap the olive oil for sesame).  So many ways to play with this recipe!

Tasty summer salad addition! Great basic recipe, and any chopped vegetables could also be added.

This is a fantastic, simple dish.

I used fresh parsley and dried cilantro and basil.  

Also I can't eat cow's milk so I used sheep feta.

I always thought that I didn't like chickpeas because they don't taste like anything. This recipe is the first time I've tried my own hand at a recipe with them.Glad to say I enjoyed it and will make it again.

This is pretty good.  It's easy and only requires readily available ingredients which is always a plus.  It's pretty heavy on the Parmesan for my taste but I suspect my husband will like it a lot.

It was great. I used a bit more lemon juice and I crush my garlic in a pestle for best flavor. I do not like minced garlic.

Didn't have lemons to juice so I went with lime juice. Will try again with lemon but the lime version was excellent!
