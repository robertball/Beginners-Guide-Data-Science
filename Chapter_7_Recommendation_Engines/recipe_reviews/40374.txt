Great Flavor! I never expected it to taste like this!
I followed the directions to the "T" for the gravy and there were no lumps; also if you are not covering with a tight fitting lid this will be somewhat dry. Follow the directions exactly and you can't go wrong.

This was a wonderful recipe, easy to make and very good. I only had a 3 and a half pound roast. So the only change I made was cutting the cooking time down to 1 hour and 15 minutes. I will certainly use this recipe again.

Easy and very tender. I had a smaller roast on hand and I think next time I will cut the cooking time down because mine was a little dry.

This recipe turned out super.  I was leery of the mint idea but what an amazing addition-very subtle.  I will be using this recipe again and again I'm sure!  This went great with red-skinned mashed potatoes (skins on) and any veggie.

I'm not always successful when I attempt to make a roast.  I'm glad to say this roast turned out awesome.  I was a bit wary of the mint but it ended up adding a really nice flavor to the meat and gravy.   I think I'll try it without the clove of garlic next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

VERY GOOD! a nice change from doing a roast in the crock pot. It turned out moist(not soggy) & delicious. Wonderful gravy. Followed the recipe exactly as written. Would definately make this again!

The meat turned out really moist and tender.  The gravy was excellent, I served it on sunday and the whole family loved it!  I'll definitely try this one again.

I wasn't crazy about the taste, but I'm not a big fan of roast beef anyway. My boyfriend loved it, and it was not too dry or anything. I'll probably keep this recipe around if I make roast again!

My family loves this recipe.  I am a vegetarian, but still have to make it for all of them.  Hubby reverts to meat eater when it is made.

Loved this! Don't have a Dutch oven, so improvised. I used a regular pot to brown the meat, and then transferred the meat to a glass baking dish and tightly wrapped the dish with foil so that no liquid would evaporate. Worked wonderfully.

I just made this for dinner...it was delicious!  I didn't add the mint because I didn't have any & I cut the cooking time as my roast was smaller.  The gravy has to be the best I've ever tasted and I cook for a living!  I think the gravy thinned down would make a fantastic vegetable beef soup!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I liked the flavor of this.  Mine was a little dry, but my roast was smaller, so I think I just overcooked it.  For the gravy, I might leave out the sage and mint and just use the juices from the meat.  I also just used the pot I cooked the meat in for the gravy...I just added the cold water mixed with flour to the juices.  As long as the heat is off, you shouldn't get lumps.  Turn the flame on after you add the liquid.  I will make this one again.

We all thoroughly enjoyed this recipe!  Even my 7-yr old, who doesn't usually want seconds on meat, asked for more!!  We made ours in the crock pot; combined the ingredients and set it on low all day.  The mint really works here and even though the meat looked dry when we sliced it, it wasn't dry at all!!  I served over a bed of mashed potatoes and made gravy with beef broth instead of water, for added flavor.

I always use the beef gravy in soup, no matter how it is made, escpecially in Beef Barley soup adds that extra bit of flavour.

We did not care for this at all.  We had a 5.4 pound round roast and set it for 2 hours, as the recipe said that would make a rare roast.  I pulled it out to check it 20 minutes prior to the timer going off, and it was already medium and on it's way to medium well.  Perhaps because I had no Dutch Oven?  Had to use a roaster after I seared it on the stove top.  But the roast was very bland, the flavors didn't really seep into it at all.  Won't be making this one again.

The roast turned out wonderfully!  I didn't have mint so I just left it out.  I did use the garlic though.  It came out beautifully tender.

Pleased even the most discerning English husband (you guessed it, mine)! Don't use all the water, then realize you could add wine, then add that too. I did, and it turned out too much liquid to make the gravy properly.

HOLY MOSES! This is one good roast! I was totally freaked by the thought of mint in my meat, but man oh man is it nice. I followed the recipe to a 'T'. My husband even took some to work and he said it smelled so good, that a coworker asked if he was going to eat it all, and if not could he have it! MMmmm!

Was tastey but a littel dry. Would try to make again though. Maybe cook for less time. Using the old 20 minutes per pound time.

Just wonderful.  Only added another half cup of water to stretch the gravy.  We had these with summer squash puffs(recipe on this sight) and some brown rice.   The entire family wants this for dinner again!  Thank you.

This sounds really good & reading the reviews looks like everyone enjoys it. I only have one question- does this turn out like the Roast Beef you would get from a Deli? Nice & Med Rare in the center. Thanks, Gutpyle

Substituted beef broth for the water and used a rump roast because that's what I had on hand.  The flavor was great, the gravy was delicious, but the meat turned out a little dry.  Will make this again, but probably with more braising liquid and a little less time in the oven.

This is not a review as I have not tried this. I just thought you should know that a true English roast with mint would be lamb, not beef.

Turned out great.
But because we cannot eat flour, I did not make gravy but opted to just putting the juices from bottom of pan into small little individual bowls and served that as a dipping sauce. My husband LOVED it.
Thanks for the great 
recipe.

This did not turn out dry, must not have had the lid on tight if it did!

I have made this twice and loved it! I followed the recipe and it comes out perfect. I wasn’t sure how the mint was going to taste, but it really imparts a nice flavor. It is truly mouth watering!!

This was simple and easy, no fail.  I used some White Cooking Wine with the water to add some flavor.  The smells as it was cooking were to die for.

If I make this again I would decrease the cooking time significantly - I used USDA Choice Top Round a step above Chuck that I normally use for pot roast. I was hoping that I could use leftovers for roast beef sandwichs, no deal it was too dry

This was very pleasant though not exceptional.  The onion is listed as optional but I thought it was essential to the flavor of the gravy.

We made it for Easter dinner with the chicken stock and it was divine. We paired it with roasted potatoes and parsnips, salad, and corn. It was amazing. It also went perfectly, with a bottle of Casillero del Diablo

Seemed to be just another pot roast version, without cream of mushroom soup.  It was nice, just nothing special we thought.

I used a tougher cut of meat in my pressure cooker.  It took almost as long to get the beef tender. (The heat/pressure combination made the meat tough before it could become tender.  The slow cooker or oven would have kept it tender.) So always use your oven or slow cooker.   The oniony,  herby, beefy gravy was a pleasant accompaniment.

This was my first time make Roast Beef for a Sunday dinner. It was excellent!! I followed instructions to the "T", except for the mint. Since I didn't have mint, I used Basil instead which is a good substitute seeing as it has a mint-like aroma. My family does not like eating rare meat, so I cooked my 2 - 2.5 lb roast for 90 minutes and let it rest for 15 minutes and it came out perfect. I served my Roast with home-made mashed potatoes, yorkshire pudding, peas, and gravy. Will definitely be doing this again, as it was a huge hit.

As everyone has said, this has great flavor. Made it just as directed but added some sliced mushrooms. I made mine in the slow cooker on low for 7 hours. Gravy was fantastic too! Definitely a keeper.

Mine turned out a little tough.  I would have added a bit more water prior to cooking.  Otherwise very tasty.

It was a little dry for us. I used a smaller roast and replaced the water with a red wine. I would cook it for less time next time I make it. Sauce with it was pretty good.

The meat come out beautiful and tender. 
My whole house smelled delicious. The only thing I would change or had to change would be the gravy.It didn't com out as thick as I would have liked with the original recipe.

Very good recipe. Liked the mint and sage. The gravy was good, but I needed to add cornstarch to thicken it up a bit. It made the meat juicy and tender. The only thing was that I kept trying to add salt and the flavor would just not take it!

I didn't enjoy this. I found the flavour bland and the meat dry. I think the problem is in using salt when the meat is being seared. I think it's leeching the moisture out of the meat. If I make this again, I won't salt it until it gets to the table.
