This recipe has a 5 star taste,  but gets 3 stars for being dangerously incomplete! 

Canning is not hard, but it MUST be done to  a specific standard.  Jelly and jams can be water bath canned without preservatives  like vinegar and salt.  When vinegar is used it MUST BE 5% vinegar,  nothing less!  Vinegar less than 5% can cause spoilage and food poisoning.   

This recipe IS NOT certified by the  national canning institute. Therefore, proper pH is not established.  Ive made it and its good.  However,  long term storage can be risky.  

If you're not familiar with the proper procedures for canning,  take the time to learn. With proper safety and knowledge,  it's an awesome way to preserve food.

This recipe is tremendously good. Just the right amount of hot and sweet. You taste the sweetness of the raspberries first, then followed by the heat of the habaneros - and it IS a nice consistent burn. Not overwhelming, but definitely present. I used fresh raspberries and measured them out with a kitchen scale rather than using cups. The only change I made was to use a red pepper rather than a green one so that the colors were consistent and blended. Five habaneros (and their seeds) produced the perfect amount of heat. A new favorite!

This is so easy to make. I used fresh raspberries. My husband asked me to make more. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe.

Perfect balance between sweet and spicy. I used blueberries instead of raspberries. This jam makes great gifts!

I also used a red bell pepper instead of green and 1 box of pectin.  I added 2# of our own frozen raspberries and cooked a little longer then called for.  The heat is just right.  I go 9 half pint jars.  Will definitely be making several more batches to give as gifts.

My favorite thing to eat this with: steak. Also delicious with sharp cheese and crackers. One issue I had though was with the consistency - mine turned out very runny. It's either the pectin amount or the time it spent cooking, not sure which. Next time I will definitely cook for longer, and may add a bit more pectin too.

Very good recipe and super easy.  I also used a red pepper vs the green and I used fresh raspberries cause they are coming out of my ears right now.  Made 6 jars (1/2 pint size)  Taste great alone but is really good when poured over cream cheese and eaten with Ritz crackers.  Everyone who tried it agrees that although you taste the heat, it is very smooth and does not "burn" your mouth at all.

Just made this today and it is very good! I used a red pepper instead of a green and a whole package of pectin. Used fresh raspberries instead of frozen. I got 8 1/2 pint jars from the batch I made.

Found this recipe to make after having some from the store that was extremely expensive.  I made two batches with frozen raspberries, then made a third batch with mixed berries (blue, black and raspberries) using a red bell both times.  Both are delicious, and have just the right amount of heat for me.  I made 18 jars and shared with neighbors then with children for Christmas gifts.  The darn kids took all the jars I had left, except two for my New Year's party, so have to make more this week for two grandkids that we won't see until later this month.   Guess it is that good.   Thank you for such a delicious recipe.    It's a keeper!!!

I never write a review but I  had to review this recipe.
I have been making this jam for a few years. I now have friends who come over so I can  help them make it. We don't  make one recipe, we do at least 3 recipes each. I never double the recipe.
This recipe is great over cream cheese but try it in with your baked brie recipe.
I have a friend who eats it on toast for breakfast!  It also makes a great hostess  gift.

I used three Ghost Chili Peppers,  and whatever bell pepper I had on hand to make up to 1. I used red, green, orange and yellow.  It made 8 half pints.  It is awesome!  I was afraid of the heat level since I didn’t bother to remove the seeds.  1st half pint demolished at work with cheese and crackers.  It’s a nice balance between the sweet raspberries and peppers and the heat from the Ghost Chili.  I am waiting to see if the heat level increases with time as the ingredients have time to marry.  One more recipe to help alleviate the 5 or 6 gallon bags of raspberries from the garden each year.

Excellent.  This was the first time I used the powdered pectin.  I am going to make it again with an extra spoonful of powder.  I'd like it a little stifferr.  Everyone loves it.  They are begging for me to sell it to them.

Turned out a little runny would suggest 1 1/2boxes of pectin.  Did 2 batches first with 1 box (3 tbs.). Second batch 1 1/3  box.  Turned out better still a touch runny.

Great recipe! Family loved it! Used a red bell pepper instead of green. Also red habanero's from the garden. I boiled it for 8-10 min. Added the pectin (I used 6 tablespoons instead of 3) and boiled for 1 min longer. I then ladled it into the hot jars immediately(1/4 headspace), wiped the rim of jar, put on hot lids and rings and processed it for 15min. The lids all popped in no more than 10min. It set up PERFECTLY! It made 8 half pints due to boiling it down more. Thanks again for the recipe. It has gorgeous appeal as well!

I followed recipe exactly but my habaneros were a little small so I used 6.  Wonderful jam with just the right spice.    Can't wait to share with family!

I made this jam using five homegrown Roatan Pumpkin Habanero peppers. The heat level is intense! I have made hot pepper jellies in the past (including Ghost pepper jelly), but this one is probably the hottest.  If I were to make this recipe again, I would probably seed the habanero peppers. The flavor is very good, but the heat is almost too hot to handle!

Wasn't sure about the vinegar, surprised that you don't really taste it.  I used only red pepper and six habanero peppers. I like it hot.  I'm trying to reproduce a sauce made by a home-show cookware company.  This was not exact, but delish regardless.  Their product ingredients state "Apple cider vinegar", but I followed this and used white vinegar.  Never canned before, but googled it and it's easier than I thought.  I'll b making this again, in smaller jars to give as gifts.  Thank you for this delicious recipe.  i also left out the pectin.  Couldn't find any in my grocery.  Just boiled the sauce down to thicken, fruit will release it's natural pectins when slow boiled and reduced.
