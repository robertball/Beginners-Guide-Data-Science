Well I have to admit I did not use the egg or milk, just used seasoned flour and pan fried to a golden brown. I was afraid that the egg and milk would create to thick of a crust, and that would take away from the wonderful crab taste.

I'm the queen of soft shell crabs and look forward to eating them every summer. So far, I've eaten about ten! I normally just dredge my crabs in seasoned flour and fry. This was a nice change and I really enjoyed these little critters. For added flavor I did season the flour with garlic and onion powders and a bit of cayenne. If you've never eaten one, give this a shot and please note that any good fish market will happily clean the crabs for you. Thanks WesBryant and happy eating!

I loved this recipe -- it was so simple.  The only thing I added was the Old Bay Seasoning to give it a little bite.

This was something completely new for DH and me!  We live just a couple of miles from Puget Sound and have eaten more than our share of fresh Dungeness... but fresh soft shelled crab is not something that we can seem to find out here.  BUT, I found some frozen ones and decided to take a chance!  Well, I'm glad I did because they are AWESOME!  I thawed them slowly in the fridge and then unwrapped them (they were IQF, luckily!) and put them on a clean, dry kitchen towel, folded over on top of them so that they were covered top and bottom, for an hour to soak up some of the moisture (they were VERY wet when thawed).  I then put them in the fridge, towel and all, until dinner time a couple of hours later.  I used the egg-milk blend and put a little Old Bay into the flour.  I fried them in fresh canola oil.  I made two each for DH and me... (with homemade tartar sauce) as well as a small piece of strip (NY) steak and some french fries.  A truly delicious meal!  It's been a couple of days and DH is still commenting on how juicy and crispy those crab were!  Thanks for the recipe, Wes!

OMG! This was the best recipe. Followed to a tee. Before, I only used flour, salt and pepper for a light coating. When I saw this recipe, I knew I had to try it. Old recipe gone ~ new recipe in! Thank you so much for sharing. Real KEEPER!

These were GREAT!  Be careful though--I defrosted mine in water because I was in a hurry--some of the legs and claws fell off as I was battering. Next time I will make enough time to defrost slowly.   I added Old Bay as well as others had.  Eat immediately after preparing!

I made these last night as it was the first time I was able to get soft-shells at my fish monger's. Just great served on toasted rolls with lettuce and tomato with just a touch of mayo! I seasoned the flour with salt and pepper and a bit of Old Bay seasoning. Yum...

This was a very simple recipe to which I made a few changes.  My son & I enjoyed the soft shelled crab, wishing I had bought more to prepare. I added salt, garlic powder, and oregano to flour mixture.  Used 2 Tbspn of oil to fry 2 soft-shell crabs.  Didn't use milk, only beaten egg before dipping into flour mixture.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

Wow! This is an easy straightforward recipe!  If you buy the crabs and have them cleaned by the fish monger  this  the rest takes no time.  A cross between a light saut√© and deep batter fried.  Nice crunch and taste!

This is how we make them on the Chesapeake Bay. The egg and milk simply help the coating and seasoning stick to the crab and do not make a heavy crust or add/detract. Good cleaning instructions for anyone new to soft crabs.

Excellent recipe!  However, we did substitute rice flour for the all-purpose flour, which made for a much lighter and fluffier crusting.  Next time we are also considering Panko crumbs.

Soft shells are one of my favorite foods and I've tried many top rated recipes and this is by far the best! Just make sure your oil is the right temp before dropping them in.

As a native of Maryland, I have enjoyed the bounty of the Chesapeake Bay my whole life.  I love hard and soft shell crab.  This was my first time actually preparing soft shell crab.  The only changes I made to this recipe was to add some Old Bay (it's a Maryland thing)and I used egg white and light milk - very light wash.  They turned out PERFECT!  Everyone who indulged loved them!

Delicious! This was a hit with my friends as well as my gluten-free friends when I made it with the gluten-free flour for them. This simple recipe allows you to add creole spices for your soft shell crab po' boys or just simple salt & pepper to pair with your favorite Asian sauce! (in the photo is a wasabi mayo)

A good basic recipe, works every time. I add Old Bay and a few other little touches--Maryland style. A mix of corn meal and flour works very well, too. The details of dressing the crab are exactly right. Now that IQF soft shells are available, I can have them anytime I want.

Pretty good but after my first attempt I sub'd Wondra Flour for Starch.  Starch gave it a gummy
