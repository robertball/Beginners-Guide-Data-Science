I have been married for over 40 years and never made Acorn Squash before.  My husband was very pleasantly surprised with this side dish. He really enjoyed it and so did I.
I modified the recipe by using a heart healthy butter substitute.  I also cut the cooking time by microwaving for 10 minutes on high instead of baking for 30 minutes.  I used a covered Corning Ware pan and then just continued with the original recipe.

I thought this recipe was actually very good.  It was easy and quick to prepare, and a great way to use the fall foods.  I did modify only a little, by changing the oven temp. to 450 for the last half of the cook time.  I didn't melt the butter (the oven will do that!) but cut into small chunks and set on the apples, and then drizzled the honey on.  I didn't use as much honey, but I'm sure that would be wonderful - I'm just trying to cut down on sugars.  I also added nutmeg to the cinnamon.
The end result was good - tender and tasty, without being too sweet or buttery.  My husband really liked it, as well, and he is never a big fan of veggies.  Thanks for the creative idea!

This was really good. A great way to get in some vegetables, as well as TONS of fiber. My husband liked it the first "sweet" layer, then he gave the rest of the squash to me. I did it a little different though. I rubbed the seeded squash with about 1 tbsp brown sugar per side then tossed the diced apples in the melted brown sugar, butter, cinnamon and added nutmeg, clove,and ginger spices. After that I drizzled a little butter over the top of that. Very good and I will make again. Although next time I think I will pierce the flesh to let the sweet juices get all throughout the squash as well as let it get more tender.

This came out perfectly! Used the basis instructions, but on the second half of cooking, just added apples, brown sugar, and chunks of butte. The greatest fall combo yet!

Such a tasty and nutritious way to fix acorn squash. I use any apple I usually have on hand and I don't bother peeling because the skin is supposed to be good for you, right? When baking, make sure you cover with foil otherwise it will come out too dry. Then when you add in the butter and honey, just cube the butter and drop them  on top and in between the apples. Makes it easier!

This was a big hit with my squash loving family. I found some small squash with a flat bottom at the local Farmer's Market And cut the tops off so that everyone had their own. The only change I made was to salt and pepper the squash cavity with salt and pepper.

Loved it! I used a non-hydrogentaed butter substitute, Gala apples - they were small, so it took three to fill both halves of the squash - and probably doubled the cinnamon.  The honey added a rich sweetness, a nice change from the brown sugar or maple syrup I usually use with baked squash.  I baked at 350, as I had something else in the oven, but I think it took about the same amount of time anyway.  Looking forward to making this one again and again! Thanks for sharing!

This is really tasty! Depending on how sweet you like it, you may have to adjust the honey. I added a bit of cinnamon/sugar to the final product for a bit more sweetness.

A beautiful dish that is quick and easy to throw in the oven. The presentation is wonderful with some walnuts and raisins as well. The squash came out a bit dry, but that might have been my mistake.

I really wasn't expecting the texture to be that different between the squash and apple but it turned out to compliment one another perfectly.  I used a granny smith apple which I think was key because it added a little tartness.  I poked holes in the squash flesh so the honey mixture could seep in.

Just made this!! So delicious!! I used coconut oil in place of butter and was generous with the cinnamon. I cooked it at 450 for 20 min at the end.

Very good.  I took note of the prior reviews regarding the squash drying out and solved that be brushing the exposed flesh of the squash with melted butter about half way through the baking time and then covering the pan I was using with foil.  Only other changes were to substitute a little Splenda for the honey, and added some dried fruit (raisins & craisins) and chopped pecans into the chopped apple stuffing.  I'm picking up another squash to do this again tomorrow

Amazing! Everyone loved it, even the youngest (18mos.) who ate two bowls. followed basic instructions except for rubbed the halves with brown sugar like someone suggested, and didn't melt the butter (we used a vegan variety), the oven melted it for us.

I love this recipe! I did the apples and the squash separate. For the apples I coated them lightly with cinnamon and honey. I added a generous splash of OJ and baked until done. Scrape the 'meat' of the squash out and top with apples. I could not get my 4 year old to eat it unless is was removed from the 'shell'. Just a suggestion!

I made some slight variations - used maple syrup instead of honey and added a dash of nutmeg.  I mixed this with the chopped apples, filled the squash, and dotted the tops with butter.  I also added a handful of chopped pecans.  I was running short on time, so I put them in Pyrex dishes with a little water in the bottom and microwaved for 5 minutes before baking.  My family looked askance at them ("this looks weird") when I served them with dinner, but after just one bite, they gobbled it up and said it was wonderful!

I made this exactly as directed (other than using a dairy-free butter substitute for my roommate) and it was fantastic.  Added a sprinkle of nutmeg along with the cinnamon.  It smells, looks, and tastes fantastic!  I will definitely be making this as a side dish next Thanksgiving.

I stabbed about 6 slits into the squash and then microwaved it for 3 minutes to make it easier to cut open.  I scooped out the seeds and placed each half, cut side down, in a bowl with about 2 inches of water in it.  I microwaved each half seperately for 4 minutes.  I cut up one gala apple, and added about 1/4 cup raisens.  I added the butter/ honey mix and then covered it with foil and baked it for 10 minutes at 400 degrees, then took the foil off and baked for another 10 min.  It cut the cooking time in half by using the microwave.

This was great and I felt healthy eating it.  I didn't peel the apple out of laziness but other than that I followed the recipe exactly, it's straightforward and easy and pretty tasty, although much more like a dessert than a veggie.  One medium sized Granny Smith chopped up fit perfectly in the squash halves.

This was very good!  And very easy.  We used 1 apple, 1 pear for a bit of variety.  I microwaved them (cut-side down) for 10 minutes and then baked (filled) for 30 minutes.  It was great with our homemade bratwurst!

Followed the recipe exactly.  It was good, but a little to sweet for my tastes.  Next time I will cut back on the butter / honey sauce.

I've stuffed squash with sausage & rice for years, but needed a lighter side dish for an autumn meal.  This was just the ticket!  The only change I made was to put a little water in the baking dish to help hydrate the squash as it baked, and I was pleased with the tender texture when it was done.  Very tasty, and a nice way to add a little fruit to a meal -- and guess what, it's just as good with pears as with apples!

I love the taste.  The squash isn't as syrupy and sweet as many recipes.  This is probably the best acorn squash I've made.

However, I would suggest maybe adding some water to the pan when you bake the squash because it took forever for the squash to get tender.

Followed directions to the letter.  Bland, undercooked and totally unedible.

Hmmmm...this looked really good, but did not turn out well.  The apples were dry and tough and the squash took 30 minutes longer to cook than planned.  The taste was nice, but the texture and appeal were lost.  I get a much nicer squash when baked cut-side down in a little water.

This was a great recipe.  It was so easy to make and I was able to use all local produce.  I usually make this with brown sugar... this is a great alternative!

Baked squash in microwave 8 minutes with apples, then 8 minutes more with butter, brown sugar and cinnamon.  So simple and delicious!

this was a really nice way to make acorn squash. My kids and husband said it reminded them of fall. The squash it self was a little dry next time I may add some butter/honey mix directly on the squash then put the apple filling on. Otherwise it was delicious.

This was pretty good and certainly easy to make. I think I would have liked it better with maple syrup or brouwn sugar instead of honey. Thanks!

This was great.  I added some raisins to the apples.  I had a difficult time cutting into the squash, so I cooked the whole thing at 400 for about 15 minutes to soften it before cutting it in half.

My family did not care for this too much. I usually prepare acorn squash with cinnamon, butter, and brown sugar.  We thought this had very little flavor.

This recipe is excellent!  I served it with a pork roast and twice baked potatoes.  I was looking for something different from the traditional acorn squash recipes that are roasted with maple syrup or brown sugar.  I'll use this recipe again and again!

I liked this combination. While I was putting on the butter and honey, I also added some pecans and just a little more butter.

The apples and honey were a nice change from my usual acorn squash recipe, but the baking time was all wrong. I had timed my dinner preparations so everything would be done at the same time, but when I took out the squash it was still so hard a fork wouldn't go in.  I had to hurry and throw one half into a Cornware dish and mircrowave it for four minutes, bringing it to the table later.  I left the second one in the oven and it took a whole hour to cook.  The squash I had were very large, so maybe that was the problem.  But everyone loved the taste!

I make a filling of chopped apples, dried fruit, brown sugar, orange juice.  Sprinkle with nutmeg and spray butter on top.

This is absolutely delicious, either as a side dish or as a main meal if you're looking for something fairly light. The only real downside is the overall length of the cooking time. I had a larger squash, so it took longer to cook than indicated. Increasing the oven temperature to 450°F for the second half of the cooking helps to mitigate that. Be sure to stab the body of the squash with a fork to let the sweetness from the honey and the apples sink in.

This was great! Made it exactly as specified in the recipe, and was very pleased with results. I'm not a big fan of loading squash with brown sugar since we're trying to eat healthier, and honey was a safer option for us. Honey added a very nice flavor to the squash.

Made it according to a culmination of the suggestions. Used butter, brown sugar, variety of spices. Pierced the acorn flesh and then spread the mixture around the inside. Put apples inside and dumped rest of mixture over that. Cooked covered and filled the bottom with some water to not dry out. The squash flavor came out in the apples which was really yummy, but the squash itself was not for me. It was very tender and palatable, but it was also stringy and a strong flavor. Agree with other reviewers that it would taste better with a different type of squash, or perhaps mine just wasn't at the perfect ripeness. Three stars because I had to make a lot of changes to make it taste good.

I would like to give more stars, because the recipe itself is fine, but the acorn squash was just too strong-tasting. I had a couple of squashes to use and served this at Thanksgiving dinner, but although the stuffing itself was delicious, it didn't do enough to counteract the taste of the acorn squash -- would have been better with a more delicately flavoured variety.
