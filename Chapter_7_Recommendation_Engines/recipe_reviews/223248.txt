I could not buy a cookie crust at the nearby grocery store so i used graham cracker crust instead. True to the author's notes, 'Very sweet but super yummy!' Try a slice with chocolate fudge syrup drizzled on top. This pie has great texture and I would definitely make it again.

I saw peanut butter, and I saw mousse, and I had to try it.  Turns out that this recipe is fantastic--you've got this tremendous light texture with a full dose of peanut butter and cream cheese, two things that are usually really heavy.  It just makes for a spectacular contrast that was devoured at our home in, literally, seconds.

I turned this into a low-carb recipe by swapping out the confectioner's sugar for Splenda and making an almond-flour crust with butter and Splenda on the bottom.  I'm figuring a total of less than ten carbs per slice (if divided into eight pieces)--that's marvelous for how good this was.

Don't pass this one up--it's a great recipe, different, and entirely satisfying ;)

Three letters say it all:  O.  M.  G.  This was absolutely delicious.  For a bit of decoration, I used chocolate-coated peanut butter candy Pieces (trade name beginning with "R"), and it was a huge hit at the Memorial Day picnic.

I followed the recipe except I used half and half instead of light cream and it was amazing.
