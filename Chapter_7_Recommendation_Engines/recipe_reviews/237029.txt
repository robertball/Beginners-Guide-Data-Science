I LOVED this recipe. My husband and I are dieting so this was a perfect snack/meal for me. I wanted to try out a can of crab since I was in a crab mood, so I used the Geisha brand crab meat with leg meat (6 oz can). I normally don't eat a lot of mayonnaise so I only used a tablespoon, which was perfect for me. I also only had Sara Lee's 45 calorie whole wheat bread on hand so I used that. To put it all together, I salted and put cheese in between the crab layer on a plate by itself and microwaved it before placing them onto the toasted bread. It was more delicious than I thought. Thanks for the recipe!
