I loved this recipe. The cherry and almond combination really kicked the boring old oatmeal up several notches. I don't use soy milk though, so used 1% cow's milk with a few drops of almond extract and a few tsps of brown sugar (for 4 servings) to replace the sweetened vanilla almond soy milk. I topped it off with some toasted chopped almonds and coconut. Very, very good. Thanks for the recipe.

I'm the submitter of the recipe.  My husband recently requested this oatmeal made with chocolate almond milk, and he likes this even more than the vanilla.  You can also use unsweetened milk and add a bit of agave nectar or any sweetener of your choice.

This bumps up to 5 stars if you add a teaspoon of almond extract.  I don't usually like oatmeal, but this was fantastic!  I did it on the stove top, as I think it is easier with these quantities.  The cherries or cranberries are better if you put them in at the beginning instead of the end.

Delicious! And, it keeps you full 'til lunch! I love the cherry & almond flavor combination which definitely perks up regular 'ol oatmeal. I never have soy milk, so I used skim milk and added some almond extract along with a bit of honey for additional sweetness.  Next time I might top it off with some real almonds and some coconut for a real treat!

yum!  thank you for this recipe.  I always buy Vanilla Breeze in the carton, so I had this in my pantry and made it with the dried cherries as the recipe called for.  It gave it a nutty flavor without adding the extra calories and fat that nuts would.  I put a mixture of splenda and sugar over it.  It was really good!  some white chocolate chips would really give it an edge with the cherries too - but I didn't have any.  I really enjoyed this easy healthy breakfast.  Thanks

Great oatmeal! I only made 1 serving so I used 1/2 cup milk, about 1/4 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp brown sugar.  I added chopped almonds and craisins instead of dried cherries.

I loved this! I followed other reviewers advice about one row of chips, and I left out the beans and sour cream, since I didn't have any. I added a taco seasoning packet as well and it was delicious!!!

I didn't have any dried cherries so I used dried cranberries instead.  I thought this was lacking in flavor so I added a little cinnamon sugar and that helped.

My new favorite breakfast! Love this! I use the same ingredients except I use the instant oats and follow the proportions on the box for one serving. The cherries with the sweetness of the almond milk is heavenly! I may never eat cereal again :). Thanks for sharing!

I already knew I would like this recipe since it calls for both cherries and almonds. I absolutely love anything that has cherries with almonds in it! I scaled this down to serve only myself since I am the only one who really eats oatmeal. I made oganic steel cut oatmeals, added soy milk, an 1/8 almond extract, fresh bing cherries, pitted, halved. I omitted the salt completely. To that I added a sprinkle of light brown sugar. Ooohh...so delicious! Tasty, slightly sweet and hearty. Loved the crunch from the almonds as it gives this a nice texture.  The cherries are juicy with a slight tart but the brown sugar offset that with its' sweetness. I was a happy camper this morning.

I didn't have vanilla almond milk. I used regular milk and added a teaspoon each of almond and vanilla extract. Because my milk wasn't sweetened, I added a quarter cup of white sugar. This was very good, this may be my new favorite breakfast oatmeal.

This was okay.  Probably won't make again.  We're not huge oatmeal fans anyway, but I wanted to give it a try.

I eat oatmeal almost daily and am always looking for ways to change it up a little bit. We use vanilla almond milk on a regular basis and love it.  This oatmeal is so good.  The crunchy almonds go so well with the sweet milk and chewy, tart cherries.  I have already made this several mornings and will continue to make it.  Thanks!

When i made this all i added to it was a tsp almond extract and vanilla extract.  very very yummy! one of my favorite comfort foods now.  and my kids love it too!  thats saying something there lol!

Great flavor combination. I like another reviewers suggestion of adding almond extract to give it even more flavor. Sometimes I don't have dried cherries but , do have a bag of frozen cherries at all times. I add them at the end. Just long enough to warm through. Oh, and as always, a generous helping of ground flax meal to ramp up the nutritious aspect just a bit more.

I reduced this to make just one serving. I added the cherries before cooking and also a little bit of pure almond extract. Super tastey! usually when making plain oatmeal, I have to add brown sugar and cinnamon, but this is wonderful without!

This is absolutely delicious oatmeal.  I had some almond milk left in the fridge that I wanted to use up, so I had this for breakfast today.  I used cherry-flavored Craisins, sprinkled some almonds on the top for a little crunch, and ended up with a fantastic bowl of oatmeal that would be served at a nice restaurant for probably $5.00 (or  more).  Going into my Favorites folder to be made again and again.  Thanks wisweetp for sharing your recipe.

I will preface this review by saying that I didn't have almond milk and I didn't have dried cherries, but I REALLY wanted to try this recipe b/c I was getting bored with my usual oatmeal recipes. I used almond extract (about 1 tsp) and dried cranberries.  I sweetened to taste with splenda.  That being said, this oatmeal was so good! I enjoyed every bite, and I'm going to go get almond milk and dried cherries today just so I can make the full batch of it (I only made enough for myself this morning) and enjoy.  This was a great way to start my morning. Thanks for the recipe!

Real simple to make and portion out for a week of breakfasts. I added a half scoop of Blueberry protein shake mix to each serving and heated with just a little milk each morning. Delicious!

It was good, the cherries added a nice flavor.  I couldn’t really taste a difference with the almond milk so that cost wasn’t justified.  If I make it again, I’ll just add almond flavoring to 2% milk.

This was very good.  The dried cherries and almonds was a good spin on my usual raisin and walnut oatmeal.  It inspired me to try and come up with other combinations such as apple walnut, and pear hazelnut.

This was fine. Just what you would expect it to taste like with vanilla almond milk and dried cherries. I added several chocolate chips to sweeten it up a bit.

I haven't tried this yet, but I do use almond milk all the time.  One of my favorite ways of making oatmeal is with unsweetened almond milk, a small banana sliced & chopped walnuts cook as normal.  I add after cooking a tsp of I can't believe it's not butter, a squirt of sugar free maple syrup then the almond milk.  You get your potasium from the banana, it is heart healthy with the oatmeal and walnuts, and sugar free!

Am I missing something from the ingredients list? The picture shows chopped almonds and coconut but no mention of these in the ingredients list. I made this on the stove top and added a a little brown sugar, cinnamon and vanilla extract for flavor as it was a bit bland.  This is a good base recipe to adjust to your personal taste. I also made this as an" Overnight oats" in a mason jar and it was good as well.

The "recipe" is good, the cooking process is flawed.

I eat oatmeal on a regular basis and was intrigued by the idea of cooking it in almond milk.   I cut the recipe down to 1 serving, used a 4 cup measuring cup and watched it carefully.   I stopped the oven after 1 minute to stir the mixture, started it up again and continued to watch carefully. 
 The mixture boiled over during the next minute before I could reduce the cooking power to about 6.  What a mess!!!    Even after lowering the power to 6, I had to stop the process every minute to stir.  I could have done this more easily on the stove top and that's what I'll do next time.

Do NOT bother with the microwave!!!

I also had to make a few changes.  Used half 1% milk and half water. Added almond extract, craisins and honey. Heated on top of stove.  Added half Old Fashioned and half Quick Oatmeal. Also added a rounded tablespoon of wheat germ and ground flaxseed.  Roasted about 12 raw almonds on top of stove, chopped them and added them with a small handful of coconut.  This is a nice change from our regular real maple syrup, craisins, walnuts and half/half oatmeal.
Thank you for sharing!

I liked using almond milk in this oatmeal, and I will try that again. Mine was unsweetened, so I added just a teaspoon of raw sugar. Like many others, I used dried cranberries, as I didn't have cherries. I would like to try the cherries too sometime. I sprinkled on some wheat germ and walnuts, which were a great addition.

I decided to make this recipe because I had Almond Milk in the refrigerator that I wanted to use and this recipe came up.  I did not want to use the microwave so I made it on the stove.  I also did not have dried cherries so I used craisins and my Almond Milk was unsweetened so I used Agave.  I also added a sprinkle of shredded coconut and slivered almonds and a little extra drizzle of Agave Nectar.  I will let you know how it turns out...So I tried it and I think it does need something I think I would sprinkle s little brown sugar on the top and this is a wonderful hearty breakfast!

Easy and Delicious!  I used dried cranberries and added about a spoonful of sugar, a few drops of almond extract and sprinkled sliced almonds over the top.  More oatmeal ideas pleeze!!!
