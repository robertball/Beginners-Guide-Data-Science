Yum!  These cookies a fabulous.  Not only is the dough wonderful to work with, the frosting really does dry hard so you can plate them in layers and they do NOT stick together because of the frosting!  I am very pleased with these.  I just made footballs with brown frosting and white laces for Superbowl Sunday!  When you bite into these, the outside is crisp and they are extremely soft and almost cakelike on the inside.  Really, really great recipe!  I did add a little imitation butter flavor and a bit more milk to the frosting to get it to the consistency I wanted.  Glad I found this one!  It's a keeper!

FANTASTIC recipe! Yes, the dough is somewhat delicate to work with but I had no problems, and I only refrigerated the dough for an hour. Use plenty of flour on your board, and you can softly brush off the excess with a basting brush. Just flatten the dough with your hands a little, and gently roll over it a few times. (Make sure you don't roll too thin) Something I feel makes these cookies so good is the butter flavored SHORTENING. Those who use real butter are not going to get the same results in texture, and it's not really fair to judge a recipe poorly if you change a main ingredient. Butter and shortening don't bake the same. These cookies baked wonderfully, tasted terrific and were easy to make. The texture is perfect, not too soft yet not crunchy. The frosting is delicious as well. Another tip- Use parchment paper and your cookies won't burn on the bottom (or brown much at all for that matter). I never make cookies with it!

I really liked this recipe.  The only thing though, is I put mine in the freezer for 3 hours and it STILL wasn't firm enough to work with.  Once it was, I pulled off a small hunk and rolled out 1 dozen, while keeping the rest in the freezer. Make sure your surface is well floured, as well as the butterknife or whatever you use to scrape it up to put it on the cookie sheet.  The cookies held their shape well and taste good, nice and soft.  Oh also don't chill your dough in the mixing bowl, scoop it out onto a sheet of plastic wrap and press into a disc shape, so it chills evenly and is easy to roll.

These are without a doubt the best sugar cookies I have ever had.  The same recipe my Grandma made and the ones that I have made for 20 years now.  Crispy on outside, cakey inside.  I leave out the milk and use 1/2 butter instead of all shortening.  I also use a butter frosting (powdered sugar, milk, vanilla and butter).  Outstanding!!!  People always want the recipe.  Also, I would suggest chilling AT LEAST 2 hours - much easier to work with.

I thought the dough was too sticky; I had to keep adding flour.  That made the cookies taste a bit floury, but it wasn't horrible.  I found a better recipe that I could do with kids (less sticky and great texture): Soft Christmas Cookies by Georgie Bowers.  I also liked the Sugar Cookie Icing by Janice Brubaker.  I probably won't make this one again.

The cookies were OK, but I will keep looking for my favorite sugar cookie recipe. There is too much baking powder in the recipe - the cookies rise "too much" and detail in the cookie is lost when baked. Also too much baking powder taste. I also found the dough very soft from the refrigerator (although chilled overnight) so difficult to remove from pastry cloth without using a lot of flour.

This was a great sugar cookie! The dough was very easy to work with. I only refrigerated it for about 15 minutes and it worked just fine. I added a little lemon flavor to the icing and a touch more milk so I could dip the cookies rather than spread the icing on and it was perfect. Thank you!

I didn't get a chance to frost these cookies they were eaten so quickly.  I quickly scanned the recipe and used regular crisco instead of butter flavored, and they were still excellent.  I'm making them again today and will be using the butter flavored this time.  I also didn't roll them, I chilled them in the freezer for about 20 minutes, dropped them onto a cookie sheet and flattened them with my hand a little.  I seriously don't think anyone could make a bad cookie with this recipe.

This is so awesome!!!  I have 4 children from the ages of 5yrs. to 11 yrs and they loved every minute making these.  I've searched for the perfect sugar cookie to decorate and I finally found it along with the most perfect icing.  The cookies were soft in the middle and very delicious.  Thank you so much Delilah for sharing your recipe.  I will past this down to my children for their children some day.

So fun and easy to make... just don't forget that you need an hour to chill the dough. (not a good last-minute recipe to make for company if you don't have the time).  I used butter instead of butter flavored shortening and like another user said, used extra flour on my countertop, hands and rolling pin when rolling them out because they're pretty sticky.  Didn't affect the taste at all though-- they tasted great and my 4-year-old niece loved making them into little bunnies for Easter!

GREAT cookies!  I didn't have butter flavored shortening so I used 1/2 Cup plain shortening and 1/4 Cup butter and they were perfect, perfect, perfect.  These are our cookies from now on!

I made these cookies last night, and they are the first cut-out sugar cookies I've ever made in my life. I was very pleased with the results!

I made the dough the night before, and used 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of almond extract instead of a full vanilla teaspoon. I also used 3 cups of flour instead of 2 1/2, and 1/2 tsp of salt instead of a full one. Those are all tips I got from other reviews. 

I then stored the dough in the fridge over night and through the next day, until I was ready to make the cookies yesterday evening.

I was very happy when it came time to roll out the dough, because it was SO easy and perfect to work with! So I would definitely recommend keeping it in the fridge for as long as possible. After cutting out my shapes (Hanukkah driedles, stars, etc) I had the oven set on 350 instead of 400, and I baked each batch for about 8 minutes. I took the cookies out when there started being a hint of gold on the edges and they were still a little soft. They hardened more once they were out of the oven.

The frosting also came out great, and I split the mixture into 2 bowls for 2 different colors. 

My fiance and I both thought these cookies tasted great!! I would definitely make these again, and the frosting really adds a tasty touch.

I made this cookie exactly as the recipe called for.  The dough would have been hard to roll out, as some other reviewers said, except that I rolled it between two sheets of parchment paper, and that helped.  But it was very difficult to lift the dough up off the paper onto the cookie sheet because the dough was so soft and flimsy.  I would have just placed the parchment paper, cookies and all, onto the cookie sheet, except that I had cut the cookies too close together.  As a result, the cookies got stretched out of shape somewhat in the transfer, and some actually tore apart.  I will say that the cookies held their shape (such as it was) during baking more than some other recipes I have tried.  I also agree with some other reviewers that the cookies were a little bland, but I actually prefer a less sweet cookie, so I thought these tasted pretty good.  The icing did not work out for me the way the recipe is written.  It took lots more milk to get the right consistency, but other than that, the icing was a winner.  It even worked to glue back together a broken cookie.  It baffles me how we can all try the same recipe and our experiences turn out so differently, but mine was such that I won't use this recipe again.

By far the easiest dough I've ever worked with!  They taste good even without icing.  They are the perfect texture.  My only problem with it is that a single batch made far less than three dozen with a normal sized cookie cutter (1" by 4").  I'd highly recommend this recipe!

Yuk!  These were bland and SO cakey!  The icing had a very funny flavor.  I followed this recipe exactly.  It rolled out and cut out great, but the flavor was undesireable.  Even to 4 kids aged 3,5,7 and 9!

My grandson and I made these cookies one afternoon and I have to say this is a wonderfully flavorful recipe. Except for the fact that I used butter instead of butter-flavored shortening (it was all I had on hand), I made the recipe as written.  The dough rolled out beautifully and kept its shape during baking.  ( Although I found that 400 degrees in my oven browned the edges a little too much so I reduced the temp to 375.)  I made two batches of frosting - one using vanilla extract and one using almond extract.  It was the perfect consistency and hardened perfectly.  I'm adding this recipe to my permanent collection.

These turned out beautifully!  Parchment paper is a must, and I too baked them at 350 for about 8-9 minutes.  I've been searching for a recipe for the bakery frosted cookies that I remember from childhood.  This is it!  Frosting is perfect as written, and the cookies taste great! (I'm not even a sugar cookie fan) My kids love them.  I even made a batch of the frosting for the gluten free cookies that I made for my youngest.  I used rice milk instead of regular milk, and it still turned out PERFECTLY!  Thank you so much for the recipe Delilah!  Definately a keeper : )

My 10-year-old son made this dough with my supervision then  I rolled it out with my 5 year old daughter.  It was easy to work with.  The icing worked nicely for spreading and piping.  Put together, the cookies tasted great.

I made these today for my daughters to frost and decorate. The recipes worked great. Baking them at 375 for 7 minutes, they came out perfectly soft but I'm still able to spread on the frosting. I didn't find a problem flavor-wise with the butter-flavored shortening like some others did. But then I ate it with the frosting. Maybe without the frosting I would have noticed and preferred a real butter taste. I will be using this recipe again.

I wish I could give these 10000000 stars! I've tried loads of cut out cookies but they were all a big disapointment. But with this recipe, I don't have to look further anymore! The dough was very easy to work with even when I didn't chill them. My cut out cookies stayed in shape all the way through. The cookies had the just the right amount of butter and sweetness, and the texture was like shortbread, but better! I absolutely love this recipe. Thank you for sharing!

I made this cookie for my son's kindergarten class Valentine's day party.  There is a child in my son's class with milk allergies, so I substituted vanilla soy milk for the small amount of milk in the cookies, and substituted butter flavored Crisco for the butter and soy milk again for the milk in the frosting.  The cookies came out fantastic - the dough was easy to work with and really tasted terrific.  I thought the frosting needed a bit more milk than the recipe called for, but that may just be personal preference (I like to use runnier icing to ice my cookies, so the frosting is not so thick on the cookie).  My daughter said it was the best cookie I'd ever made!  Thanks for an easy recipe - just what I was looking for!  And with small amounts of milk products that one could easily make substitutions for, it really fits the bill for someone with milk allergies!

This recipe was fantastic. It couldn't have been easier. I followed the recipe exactly. I made a double recipe. It came out exactly right and the icing was perfect!! I was thrilled because I had never made a recipe like this before. My 3 children go to 3 different schools and they each will have lovely cookies to bring for their class!

These are delicious.  I made them with my 6 yr.old grandson - he took some to school for valentine's day.  I cut the icing recipe in half and still had some left over.  My 19 mth. old grand-daughter ate two and came back looking for more - she just let them melt in her mouth.

This cookie recipe is better than grandma's ,its so easy to make and the taste is awesome. The only thing I changed is I used 1/2 tsp lemon extract instead of vanilla. It gave it that little extra yum!
My husband is the cookie expert and thought they were the BEST he ever had. Thank You

I only made the icing (used it for a gingerbread man recipe).  I had to add more milk than it called for.  Added 1/2 tsp of almond oil.  Delicious and easy to work with!  Piped it out of a baggie where I cut a tiny tip off the corner.

I was really pleased with the flavor and consistency of this dough.  I followed the recipe to a "T", and they turned out wonderful.  I was impressed with the fact they were firm but not stiff or crumbly.  I have had other recipes in which the cut-out shapes are so puffy after baking you can't tell what they are.  I used these on an intricately designed snowflake cutter, and they looked exactly like they did before baking.  This recipe is a keeper to me!!!

I have no idea about the cookie batter, I used "The Best Rolled Shugar Cookies" instead, but the icing from this is absolutely perfect. Dried perfectly hard. made up 1 cup of icing sugar at a time so that I could change colours and get through the icing before it dried. To cover the tops of the cookies, I made the icing up in a soup bowl, which I then dipped the entire top of the cookie into. The cookie surface requires some clean up, but this is super easy if you're not squeamish about using your fingers, and all of the edges will be even and perfect.

All in all, a good recipe.  The dough was easy to work with, and the cookies came out tasty.  One of the best sugar cookie recipes I have found so far and I have tried many.  The frosting also works well with the cookies.

Once again, these turned out great!  I had to use butter and the result was a richer cookie.  The dough was easy to roll out once the it had been in the fridge for a few hrs.  When a tray of cookies was in the oven, I put the unused dough in the freezer until it was time to roll it out again and I had no problems.  Whoever gives this recipe bad ratings must not be doing something right.

I guess I had high expectation for these cookies because of all the high ratings. But these cookies were not very good... the icing recipe was good, but that was about it. I love thick chewy sugar cookies and these cookies got hard when they cooled and they were not moist at all.  If your looking for a great sugar cookie recipe try martha's stewart sugar cookie recipe...they are great!!!!.

I originally gave this cookie a bad review. The first night I made them, I didn't think they tasted very good.  Well, they were great on the second day.  My whole family gobbled them up, and then I had to make more.  
I would definitely recommend letting this dough chill for a long time - it helps with flavor and prep.

I made these for my boyfriend for valentines day.  It was my first time making sugar cookies.  They turned out great!  It was fairly time consuming as you have to wait for the dough to chill.  I found the dough quite moist and a greasy when cutting into shapes.  Perhaps I should've let it chill longer than 1 hour.  Then I had to cut out all the heart shapes, cook , wait for them to cool before icing.  I made white/red/pink icing and added little sprinkles and wrote our names on them.  They looked so pretty and were very yummy!!  I think I made some of the cookies too thin and those ones turned out a tad to crispy when cooled.  But the thicker ones are still soft 2 days later.  A great recipe!  I will definitely make these again and have no need for searching for a new sugar cookie recipe ever again.  My boyfriends mom asked for the recipe as well.  It was a great way to personalize a gift - they looked & tasted great!

These cookies were great.  They were easy to make and tasted great.  We added a lot more milk to the frosting to dip our cookies and then the kids came in and we painted designs on them with small paint brushes.  I would definitly recommend you make these.

Good recipe, slightly bland, but better with the icing decorations.  Definately bake only until the edges are slightly golden.  Work fast when rolling/cutting.  And, the thicker the better!  Will keep recipe, but try out others as well.

I made these and took them to work. They were a HUGE hit.  They melted in you mouth and were so easy to make.  I substituted the Sugar Cookie Icing submitted by Janice Brubaker. Made a wonderful hard, shiny frosting. Great compliment to these cookies.

The cookies were easy to make and they rolled out well after refrigeration.  My kids thought they weren't sweet enough without frosting.  So if you plan on topping with only sprinkles, you might need a bit more sugar.

Sorry but the dough was way too sticky to work with even after leaving in the refrigerator for more than an hour. I ended up having to add more flour but after that the cookies tasted like flour too.

These cookies were absolutely fantastic.  They are definitely the best sugar cookies I've ever had and the frosting worked perfectly with them.  The only word of advice I have is to make sure the centers don't look wet when you take them out of the oven.  I cooked them for ten minutes and took them out when the centers looks wet assuming they would be fine and both my daughter and I felt very sick after eating one.  Don't make the same mistake I did, leave them in until the centers look cooked!  Other than my mistake these were absolutely perfect.

Wonderful recipe! Really tasty and perfect texture, firm shape yet soft when you bite into it.  I used cherry extract for valentines day.  Also, I divided the batter in half, one half had chopped maraschino cherry's, the other followed the recipe exactly.  The cherry portion did not rise as well as the regular portion.  It was worth a try...I'm sure the additional moisture threw the chemistry off.

This is a great recipe for standard cut-out cookies and I have tried many!  I always add approx. 1/2 cup more flour.  This makes the dough easier to handle and cookies sturdier for decorating. I do not use the frosting recipe, I decorate with royal icing.  These always turn out and I highly recommend them!

Awesome for cut-outs.  I do make two changes, using all butter instead of the shortening, and I use 1/2 vanilla and 1/2 almond flavoring.  Then these cookies come out tasting almost like shortbread.  I also don't have any problem rolling these out, you can use a lot of flour in the rolling process and it doesn't hurt the dough.

This recipe makes a tender, delicate sugar cookie. I decreased the salt to 1/2 tsp. and used 1/2 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. lemon extracts. We did not frost them, my daughter decorated with green sugars and sprinkles for St.Patrick's Day.

I made these three times over the holidays.  Each time I either used butter only, butter flavored shortening only, or a combo of the two and all batches came out delicious!  I split the batch in half, wrapped each ball in wax paper, then put in the freezer to harden.  That way I only had to take one ball out at a time to do the rolling and cutting, and I didn't have a problem with the dough softening.  Also, don't be afraid to use plenty of flour for the rolling.  I was generous and my cookies still came out soft.  In fact they got softer as a few days went by.  I will be using this recipe for many years to come. Thanks, Delilah

the cookies had excellent flavor. I would not suggest these for beginners or someone who doesn't want to take a lot of extra steps to make these. I put the dough in the fridge overnight. I used wax paper to roll out the dough. I also put wax paper on the cookie sheets so I could lift them off the pan. the dough is very tacky after it reachs room temp. But its very good

I needed a recipe that I could maybe make a little thicker than your basic sugar cookie.  About 1/2" rather than 1/4"   I used a cross cookie cutter for my sons baptism favors.  The cookies cooked perfectly.  I lowered the heat to 375 instead of 400 and watched them carefully.  PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT.  They tasted delicious and everyone loved them!!!

The icing was perfect as well.  I let it dry completely and put them in celophan bags.  Did not smudge or dent.  My guest ate them up and I got so many compliments through out the week.

I'm not a big sugar cookie fan, but these were suprisingly good.  I get a kick out of making seasonal cookies for my daughter - so far these cookies have been made for Groundhog Day, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day and the 4th of July.  Whew!

These are the best ever! I'm not sure what went wrong for the ones who gave this recipe a bad review but what they say just isn't true. It must have been the baker! The cookies are AWESOME.

My 5 starts are for the frosting. I did not use the cookie recipe but I needed a frosting that would just glaze, then set up nicely. This did both and tasted yummy too! If I try the cookies I'll let you know but the frosting gets 5 stars! Thanks!

I thought these were great. I made them for the office for the 4th of July, so I cut them into star shapes and coated them with red and blue icing. Everyone loved them. They were easy to transfer from cutting to the pan and the icing didn't overwhelm the cookies, which I had been afraid of. This will be my standard sugar cookie recipe now.

The cookie dough was easy to make, but after refrigerating the dough was VERY crumbly.  We folllowed the recipe exactly, but after adding a little water to the crumbly mixture, the dough was ok to roll.  The cookies never did rise and never did spread (which is good in a sense b/c they kept their shape VERY well).  We doubled the frosting for the cookies and made 6 pastel colors for Easter cutouts.  One thing I did do differently to the cookies and frosting - a touch of lemon extract.  A great addition.  Next time I may try strawberry extract.  It took us about 1.5 hours to decorate these cookies, but it was so much fun.  The end product was a somewhat plain tasting cookie with a GREAT tasting frosting.  In the end, everyone enjoyed them.  Thanks for sharing...especially the frosting!

I have recently tryed this recipe for extra credit in my cooking class. They absolutely loved it! At first i thought there was something wrong with it because the cookies swelled up. they were not doughy inside but cakey like the cookies you buy in the store. The frosting added a special touch too!

I only used the icing for this recipe because I didn't see any reviews saying the cookies turned out soft...which was my goal. I used Grandma Minnie's cookie recipe (5 *'s) and this icing was great! It was just what I wanted because I wanted to dip the cookies in the icing and let it dry hard... turned out just fine.

The cookies were not too sweet, soft and and crispy on outside.  I did adjust the time to bake to my oven.  The frosting creates a soft shiny glaze that makes them stackable and is delicious.  I used white whole wheat flour and the kids didn't notice.  May try adding flavoring like some of the reviewers suggested next time.

The dough to these cookies were easy to work with. The cookies are kinda bland. I think they're suppose to be though. Definately needed the frosting. I'm not sure if i'll make again or try another recipe.

BEST sugar cookie recipe ever! My kids adore these in their lunchbox. I make the dough and bake up a dozen cookies and place the rest in the fridge for another day. Stores up to a week this way, or freeze for later use. Great way to entertain kids at a party, deocrate cookies.

This is the best sugar cookie dough I have ever worked with. If you roll the cookie dough out thinly they keep their shape very nice and don't puff up to much

This is a great sugar cookie recipe. It was very crumbly once I took it out of the frig but once it warmed up a little it was much easier to work with. This will probably be my 'go-to' recipe for Christmas sugar cookies!

I made a big batch of skull and star shaped cookies using this recipe, and they came out looking seriously tasty!  However,  I didn't find the actual taste itself to be  the greatest. No worries, though, there's nothing wrong with the recipe, nor did I mess anything up. ((This time, haha.))  Y'see, the problem is, when I bite into a sugar cookie, I want it to be so sweet that my fillings ache, basically ... And these cookies simply didn't deliver that kind of sugary goodness! However, if you're a bigger fan of a mild sugar cookie --- One with just a soft hint of sugary taste --- Then this recipe is definitely for you!  PS: I used a container of Betty Crocker's Rainbow Chip icing instead of the frosting recipe provided, as I've never been a fan of frostings made primarily out of powdered sugar and milk.

This is the first sugar cookie/frosting recipe that I have actually enjoyed making b/c they turned out so well! Not only were they beautiful and easy to transport b/c the frosting sets so nicely...they were also delicious and everyone who ate them said they tasted professional. I've never gotten that response with cookies!

This recipe was extremely easy.  I didn't change anything about the recipe, and I chilled the dough for about 3 hours.The dough was perfect; it rolled easily and never stuck to my rolling pin, or the very lightly floured counter top.  The dough worked well with the cookie cutters.  The icing was super easy to make, and very tasty.  These cookies baked beautifully and tasted awesome!  This is a keeper.

These turned out so delicious! Light and tender, these reminded me of a shortbread in a way. Buttery tasting, very sweet. My family loved these. Icing dried nicely and they were stackable. This was a tender cookie not dry, crisp, or crunchy. Much better than the store bought iced shaped cookies. I only used a half tsp of salt, it sounded like a lot as wriiten, and I used self rising flour and skipped the baking soda. This made 3 dozen cookies.

I love this recipe, I have even made them the "lazy" way without rolling them out and cutting with cookie cutters. I just roll them into balls and flatten the with a flat bottom cup dipped in flour or sugar so they don't stick to the cup. If you are being REALLY lazy, you don't even need to flatten them out. If you cook them as the ball, they sort of melt down and cook as a mound. Then I just zigzag the icing over the top. Goes MUCH quicker and they are just as tasty!! All the yumminess with a fraction of the work involved!!!

This was a very easy cookie to make!  It rolled out fine for me.  I used almond flavoring instead of vanilla in the dough and in my glaze.  The glaze recipe also gets firm quickly.  I made 4 batches and took them to a cookie exchange.  They were a hit. I'll make this recipe again!

This was an excellent recipe.  I doubled the batch and separated into 4 separate batches.  I only chilled for an hour and took one batch out at a time.  It was the perfect cut out cookie, not too sticky!  I accidentally added too much salt but noone seemed to notice except for me.  Thank you Delilah!!

A while back I rated this recipe but I wanted to come back to add a few comments. This year at cookie baking time I honnestly couldnt remember which recipe I liked best so I made the 2 I had gotten off this site, this one and The Best Rolled Sugar Cookie. I preped the dough and put in my freezer for a few days, labeling them. I made "Delilah's" into one shape and "Best" into another. Both my sister and I agreed Delilah's was the winner. "Best" is a good recipe too but I like this one better for rolling and eating! The butter flavored shortening vs. real butter must make the difference between the two. Keeping the dough well chilled or freezing prior to use is the trick to making this dough work best for you.

I made these in the shape of baseball bats for my daughters softball team and "wrote" the teams name on with the frosting after first giving them a coat of glaze.  Tip:  If writing on the cookies as a little extra powdered sugar to the glaze you are writing with so it is not too runny.

The perfect cut-out recipe.  I use butter instead of butter-flavored shortening because I prefer the flavor of real butter, and the cookies always turn out wonderfully.

This dough does require plenty of flour sprinkled on the counter for rolling out, but the finished product is very tender and flaky so the tiny inconvenience of working with a stickier dough is well worth it.

I mix up three or four batches of dough at once and wrap and chill in the fridge overnight or even for a few days.  That way the children can cut out the cookies and bake them without the mess of mixing or then having to wait for the dough to chill.

Great recipe!

If I could give these more stars, I would. These are the greatest sugar cookies I've ever had. Super simple and the frosting sets so nicely. I've made them twice within the past 2 weeks and they get eaten up so fast. This is the one that I've been looking for.

PERFECT!!
This is the kind of recipe that will be in my family forever.  Only change, I usually make an additional half of a recipe of frosting because we like it thick!  Thank you so much Delilah for my family's favorite cookies!

FANTASTIC!
I took other's advice and used plenty of flour when rolling and cutting out. Also, check cookies after 5 min, mine were done!I read someone could not get their decorations to stick-I just frosted each then immediatly sprinkled-no problems.

Even though this recipe doesn't need another review I thought I'd add my 2 cents. The dough seemed sticky when I first pulled it out of the frige, but it was pretty easy to roll out as long as you use enough flour. I substituted 1/2 c whole wheat flour for 1/2 c regular four so I could pretend that these were healthier, and used my own frosting recipe. Everything else I did was per the recipe and these came out as really great, sturdy sugar cookies. *Edit* After making these again and using the frosting recipe that comes with these cookies, we all thought these tasted just like Eat'n Parks smiley cookies. YUM:)

I made this cookie recipe twice around the holidays (one with and once without the icing).  They came out very good especially right out of the oven.  The first time I made the cookies I had a problem with the dough sticking to the rolling pin, so the second time I made them I actually let the dough rest in the fridge overnight.  I took out a portion to work with while the rest was put back in he fridge.  This worked very well and the cookies were great.

I used half butter, half regular shortening and the dough did turn out too soft and hard to move. So I rolled the dough between two sheets of parchment, then placed the cutters on the dough and removed the excess dough from around the outside of the cutters. I didn't have to mess with transferring the dough, just moved the parchment paper onto the cookie sheet. Perfect looking cookies everytime and our new favorite recipe!

I doubled this recipe and used half butter and half butter-flavored crisco. They turned out perfectly-even better than I had expected. I didn't even need flour to roll them out, I just used wax paper, rolled them out to about a one half inch thickness, and as an earlier reviewer had suggested, baked them at 375 degrees (for 10 minutes) , and had gorgeous, soft sugar cookies for the holidays.

I made these for halloween pumpkin cut-outs. Great!!  However, I used 1/4 c butter and 1/2 c shortening and they turned out really good. Don't overbake...the bottoms should not brown for a good soft cookie.  The frosting is perfect as it hardens so you can stack the cookies w/o the frosting getting all over.

Excellent recipe! I made these for a baby shower and they were a hit! As others suggested, I added an additional tablespoon of milk to the frosting. It made it shiny and much easier to spread, and it still hardened up. I will definitely make these again!

Delicious! Taste just like the sugar ccokies you find in the bakery at the grocery store (the thick cakey ones that aren't that sweet, but the frosting makes them perfect!)

This is such a good recipe.  I have made these cookies w/regular shortening and butter flavored.  They came out delicious either way.  The cookies come out best if it is well chilled and the dough can be frozen and used on a rainy day.

I havenow used this recipe for many holoiday cookies and have recieved many requests for this recipe.
The BEST sugar cookie recipe I have used by far.
The only difference for me was to use butter instead of shortening, especially if your want to avoid hydrogenated oils.

Cookies tasted great!  1 hour in fridge is definitely not enough, though.  Try 2+, or an additional half-hour in freezer.  I'll remember this recipe at Christmas--thanks!

These are great little cookies! I made two batches because I was using larger cookie cutters in the shape of pumpkins for my kindergardeners class.  I wrote the names of each child on a cookie.  My frosting was a little runny to work with but it could have been my fault, I had a 5 and 3 yr old helping me measure!

My 6yr old and I made these last night for cookie bouquets for him to give to his teacher, grandmother and great grandmother. I was a little worried at first because the cookies were kind of hard when I took them out of the oven, but then I tasted them.  Nothing outstanding, but definately good and worked great for what we were making them for.  Had they been too soft they would not have stayed on the popsicle sticks.  Definately a recipe worth keeping! thanks for sharing!

These cookies were a disaster to make!! The recipe does not call for enough flour -  they were impossible to roll. I ended up adding at least another 3/4 cup of flour in order to roll them.  They also taste really bland.

Overall, a very good recipe!  Easy ingrediants, easy prep.  Pretty easy to work with if you are using cutters as well.  The frosted ones are to die for.  The only thing is the next day they were slighty on the dry side.  Not bad, just not as fresh. And I usually underbake mine to get them soft and chewy.  So, not sure what to try next.  Maybe a little more shortening.

Dough was completely impossible to transfer to cookie sheet once cut out so I had to roll it out on the cookie sheet on top of parchment paper and just remove the excess dough from around the shapes cut. The cookies themselves were dull. If you're craving something sweet they really don't satisfy, until you put the icing on, but I found the icing to be too sweet and not in a good way. Next time I'll definitely be putting more flavouring in the icing, maybe a little extra sugar in the sugar cookies. Though there are certain variables; I halved the recipe, used almond milk (because that's all I have), used becel margarine instead of actual butter or shortening (again all I had-end of the month finance issues).  I figured the almond milk would give it a nice nutty taste and it did but the blandness of the cookie itself even still was overwhelming. Same goes for the icing, could taste a hint of almond and vanilla but it had a weird aftertaste. They're edible though, just not something I'd make again to give as an anniversary gift :(

The best frosted sugar cookie.  My girls and I have been making them for years now.  I tried another recipe from this website with slightly higher reviews and was disappointed.  I make 4 times the frosting, add food coloring, place frosting in a piping bags and we get creative.  Time consuming but worth the memories at Christmas time.

I've finally found the perfect sugar cookie recipe (well, with some modifications -- thank you, helpmecook82).  These cookies taste great, have a wonderfully soft texture, and retain their shape (they do not blow up and lose their shape like other cookie cut-out recipes).  Also, the icing is perfect!  It tastes great and hardens so that you can actually stack the cookies on top of each other (you do need to wait a few hours for it to harden).    

The modifications I did were that I used 3 cups of flour, instead of 2 1/2, I used 1/2 teaspoon salt instead of a full teaspoon, and I used 3/4 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon of almond extract.  I also  let the dough sit overnight in the refrigerator because otherwise I found it to be too sticky to work with.  When the time came to roll out the dough, I found the dough to be extremely easy to work with.  I baked the cookies at 350 for 9 minutes.  They were still a little soft when I took them out.  When I frosted them, I simply used a pastry brush and "painted" the icing on the cookies.  It was super easy.  Thanks for the great recipe!

DO NOT OVERBAKE THESE COOKIES. Bake them only until just done--8 minutes is way too much. Even getting slightly golden on the bottom or edges changes the taste and texture.  Start with 6 minutes and then go from there.  I thought they could have used a bit more flavor, but the ones that were barely baked had a much better texture--these cookies are all about texture, not flavor.  Working with them was okay--if you refrigerate them and then roll the dough between sheets of waxed paper and freeze them for a couple of minutes, it is extremely easy to work with and scraps can be rerolled without getting too floury.

I made these without the frosting since I used colored sugar.  I imagine they would be 5 stars with the frosting.

Made these for Christmas cookie platers. They rolled out like a dream and were pretty tasty, used royal icings so I could stack them onto platters.

I was looking forward to making cut out cookies with my girls. A bit disappointed in the recipe, it was not at all easy to roll out. I am rolling them out myself very delicately. I hope i can enjoy the frosting part with my girls.

OK, so i followed the recipe to a T, the dough was awful to work with. It kept cracking and just took so much extra effort to try to get a cookie shape. Any suggestions? The cookie has very little flavor, havent frosted them yet. Frankly i dont know if i want to put any more energy into these. Maybe all the flavor is up the the icing?

Best icing I have ever worked with.  It set up nicely so you could stack, but it was not too hard when you bit into it.  Dough was easy to work with.  I took another reviewer's advice and dipped my cookies in the frosting-they turned out beautiful.  This is now my go to recipe for sugar cookies and frosting.

This was the first time I have been able to make cut-out cookies successfully. This was an easy recipe and the cookies came out great. Follow it exactly and make sure you cut your cookies thick enough.

I just made these cookies and they are delicious!! They only thing I did different was to add lemon zest to the batter. My mom always does that with her cut-outs, and it adds a wonderful flavor. These are sooo yummy!!! Thanks for the great recipe!

They were good, but still, I missed the real buttery flavor. I'll probably add a combination of shortening/butter next time. I didn't try out the frosting because I had been wanting for some time to try a Royal Icing recipe, but next time I definitely will!

This was one of 3 recipes we made for cut out cookies.  It was by far the favorite of everyone.  The dough is easy to work with...the cookies do not puff up-shapes stay as planned and are DELICOUS!  We used powdered sugar to roll them out-cooked for 8 minutes.  1 batch made 34 medium sized cookies.

This recipe is awesome!  I found that instead of rolling it out in one big sheet with a rolling pin - just taking a baseball size amount of dough and pressing with my hands worked best.  My family kept making comments about how good they were - the flavor is perfectly paired with the icing.  This is my new sugar cookie recipe.  I don't need to look any father.

Great all around!!! Made it just like it said too. My findings were that even if they don't look done they are. You don't want brown edges. I used a lot of flour on my mat and it made them roll out very well! The frosting was great. If you are using normal food coloring hold back on a little bit of milk so you don't make it too watery. If you cut the cookies at 1/2 inch thickness they are just like the frosted store cookies!!!

Tastes good, but cookies turned out too blobby - the shape of the cookie cutter wasn't retained. Possibly my mix, though, it was very wet and sticky before I rolled it out.

Tastes like the cookies we used to get for every holiday from a bakery back home!

I didn't have butter flavored shortening on had, so I used same amount of regular shortening and added 2 Tablespoons melted butter and it worked just the same.

Can't wait to make them again!

** Made them back in October for a get together.  We're meeting again in January and I've already had 3 people request mto make these again.

Ive been baking these cookies for several years now.  They come out perfect every time.  I always double the recipe and freeze the extra dozens of cookies for later eats.  The children eat them straight out the freezer (they don't freeze rock hard). Thanks for sharing.

This is a great recipe for cutouts.  I am always looking for the "perfect" cut out recipe.  This one is up there. However, a little too soft. I prefer a little crunchier.  The cookies looked beautiful and were all eaten! Thanks!

Fantastic! I took other reviewers advice and baked for 10 minutes at 350. Additionally, I cut the salt in half and added 1/3 cup flour. Rolled out and baked beautifully. The frosting was really, really good too. Great recipe!

My cookies turned out PERFECT-- thanks to all the positive AND negative comments.  The only changes I made was cutting down the salt to 1/2 tsp and I rolled my dough out a little thinner.  The frosting was yummy and they were stackable once the frosting dried completely.  My biggest helper was parchment paper.  I used it to store the dough (made two separate hunks), roll the dough, and cook on.  It made the rolling process painless and my tools were practically clean!  The parchment paper REALLY helped when it came time to pushing the cut cookie away from the scrap pieces.  (I bunched up the scrap pieces, put it in the freezer while I rolled out the other hunk of dough.)  There was no need for extra flour or powdered sugar while rolling but I did use powdered sugar to dip my cookie cutter in so that it didn't stick to the sides of the cutter.  Thanks Delilah, I'll use it again very soon!

Just finished making this recipe into fantastic little pumpkins.  I did follow others suggestions:  little less salt; oven 350 degrees; part flour - part confectioner's sugar on wax paper to roll out; also used wax paper between rolling pin and dough. Rolled out perfect.  Frosted them with the recipe as stated without changing.  Made the eyes, nose and mouth with black decorating gel.  They are the cutest things.  Can't wait to give them to my grandkids.  Thanks Delilah for a perfect recipe.

I made this recipe a few days ago and it was a big hit.  I needed more flour than the recipe called for (about 2 3/4 cups).  I rolled it out in part flour & part confectioner's sugar (I was afraid they'd be too flour-y).  I tried one w/o the icing--definitely benefits from the icing!  It didn't take much milk (about 1 T) to get it to a pipeable consistency.

I didn't have much trouble rolling these out. I just made sure to keep the work surface floured and I used parchment paper between the rolling pin and the dough. I liked the texture - it was slightly crisp on the outside and soft and moist on the inside - but I wasn't blown away by the taste. I was looking for a sugar cookie that didn't need icing - this wasn't it. The icing was very good though. I prefer my sugar cookies without icing so I will not be making these again.

I am so happy have finally found the PERFECT SOFT SUGAR COOKIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! followed the recipe exactly, has really good flavor (that a lot of other sugar cookies lack.)  It's hard to find a soft non-cakey sugar cookie that has good flavor, but these really do taste wonderful and are so nice and soft and keep their shape.

As long as you refrigerate the dough, it's not hard to work with at all.  

EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This is one of the best recipes I've found. The dough is really easy to work with and doesn't get messy if it's sat out for awhile. I doubled it for Halloween and think I'll triple it for Christmas cookies. They are great even without the icing!

Great flavor. The recipe only yields about 2 Doz cookies though. I used large Wilton cutters maybe that is why. If you are looking for a cake type cookie this is not the one. These tend to be more firm than cake like. Kids liked them though. I would make again. I found the dough to be more than managable once it was completely chilled. I had plent of time to work with it in a hot kitchen.

These cookies turned out great!  I had no problem with it being too soft to roll.  The icing was great, too.  It dries very quickly.    I put sprinkles on the top so I had to make sure to sprinkles as I frosted so they'd stick.

I also used half brown sugar to help keep the cookies soft.

My dough was really soft too, and I left it in the fridge for a couple days. I used a quarter of the dough at a time and put the rest in the freezer, it worked great. I had to work quick, the dough warms up fast and it gets sticky. I rolled it out on silpat with flour and some powdered sugar. Some of them puffed up a bit, but still looked great. The thick ones were the best, I love chewy sugar cookies and that was the ticket! I used the 'sugar cookie frosting' recipe and it was awesome, complements the cookie really well.

I loved this recipe.  I found the dough really easy to work with - I chilled the dough for about an hour and used a cold marble rolling pin.  They baked quickly and they are the best cut out cookie I've ever tasted!  I'll be passing this recipe along.

This is the first time making sugar cookies and I'm soo glad I decided to use this recipe! They taste great and are easy to make (including frosting)! I followed recipe exactly and they turned out great. My husband and two sons would have had them all ate before I even frosted them, but I wouldn't let them. I wanted to try the frosting! Thank you for the exellent recipe!

Great Sugar Cookies! Not to sweet, and worked well with royal icing. When you bring the dough out of the ice box let it warm up on the counter for 15-20 mins for easier rolling.

I really wanted these to be great sugar cookies; unfortunately, of the three dozen I iced, I have all but about 4 of them left. And yes, followed the recipe exactly. They just aren't great cookies. Or icing. Sugar cookie dough should not be hard to work with, and this takes so much time and patience, it's just not worth the effort.

I found this dough very difficult to work with. I used butter for the flavor, chilled the dough very well, but still had a terrible time.  Not worth the trouble, and I really enjoy the butter flavor over the shortening.

My first foray into cut out sugar cookies so based on the high user rating I chose to make these cookies.  The dough was firm for the cutouts and held their shape wonderfully.  The icing was very good as well although I had to alter it a little as I did not have enough confectioners sugar, but the kids loved them and before you knew it they were gone!  Will make again.

We LOVE these cookies! I have started rolling out the dough between two pieces of wax paper and that helps with stickiness issues. It's also easier to clean up. My daughters insisted on making this for their Christmas party tomorrow!

These are fantastic!  They work up great, will be a bit sticky but that is ok.  Refrigerate them overnight then roll out on a lightly floured surface.  They hold their shape great and are so tastey.  I do add about a 1/4 cup more sugar to them.  The frosting is great as well.

We like this recipe. Tonight my daughter made the cookies in a star shape to take to the VA Hospital tomorrow for Memorial Day. She wanted to frost the stars red, white, and blue. She made the frosting but it came out VERY grainy. We went over the recipe several times and finally she went to the store and bought pre-made frosting. We had an A-HA!! moment when we figured out that she had used regular sugar instead of powdered sugar. We've tried the frosting before and it is very good. Will use this recipe again. Cookies could use a bit of almond flavoring, frosting too, they are a bit bland. We used butter flavoring with the vanilla in the cookies.

Sorry, this recipe just didn't cut it.  Thet were too crisp for us.  We like em soft.  I even tried lowering the temp and baking time, but still to crisp.  They didn't raise all while baking, so they were too thin.  Think I will stick to the one I have used for yrs.  Tried this one because they didn't need to be refrigrated for too long.  I couldn't even take them to my sons school, they were that bad.  Sorry.

I'm sorry, but I didn't care much for this recipe - the cookies themselves were quite bland. I did, however, like the frosting!  I liked how it hardened and I might use it again with a different cookie recipe.

YUMMY!  These are so good,  if you like the PILLSBURY sugar cookie mix that comes in the tube, you'll love these, they taste exactly the same, only I know what is in these...No Additives or Preservatives like in Pillsbury's.  I love to eat the dough.  So there wasn't much left for baking.  Will definitely make again and again.

I only made the frosting from this recipe and WOW!
It is so yummy. It reminds me of the Christmas sugar cookie frosting I had as a kid. Thank you. I will use this recipe every year!

These turned out great. My daughter said they were the best sugar cookies I ever made. For those who had trouble rolling the dough, I have a suggestion: Buy yourself a rolling pin cover and cloth. Fold the cloth over a large cutting board. You work flour into the cloth and cover. I tell everyone this is the best kitchen investment I ever made. Since I bought it, I have never had a problem rolling any kind of cookie dough or pie crust. Prior to that, baking anything that needed to be rolled, was a nightmare for me.

I used half margarine and half shortening. The taste was great, especially with frosting, but the dough was way too soft to roll out. I added an extra 1/3 cup flour, but that really didn't help the softness, and I was afraid to add more. Instead of rolling the dough out, I just made little balls and flattened them to circles.

This is a great sugar cookie recipe! I had better success cutting out shapes by using alot of flour on my rolling surface and cutters. Good flavor, although not the recipe for you if you are planning to skip frosting, they would be too bland.

Yummy cookies!  I used 1/2 cup butter flavored Crisco and 1/4 cup of margarine and they turned out excellent! I separated the dough in 2 sandwich ziploc baggies, chilled them in the fridge and baked half batch the same day and the other half a few days later.  I just baked the second half after letting the dough sit in the fridge a few days and they were just as good!   I noticed that my sugar cookies were softer(crispy when taken out of the oven but will go soft the next day) and my husband prefers them soft.   The glaze is a little sweet, but since the cookies are not as sweet -- it's a great combination!  Very addicting!

I almost couldn't wait to finish these cookies so I could get on here and exclaim over them.  It's been probably 10 years since I made cutout cookies because they are such a pain. This recipe changed my mind. Not only are they delicious, but the dough is effortless to work with; it rolled out easily and the cookies puffed up so pretty. I didn't have butter-flavored shortening & used one stick of butter and 1/4 cup regular shortening instead. Also used mini-cookie cutters and cut the time down by a minute.  Don't make them too thick. These cookies are black Lab tested by the way. (G-r-r-r-r-r-r!)

These came out so pretty and professional looking. The icing is a great alternative to "royal icing" and can be thinned down with milk and brushed on with a pastry brush.

This dough was easy to mix up, but like a few other reviewers said, it did not harden at all in the fridge (and putting it in the freezer was not much better).  It stayed soft to the point where after rolling the dough out, I had to slide a spatula underneath, cut out the shape, and transfer it to the baking sheet.  Despite the annoyingly soft dough, and the fact that it only made about 1 1/2 dozen cookies, the cookie tasted good.  I think I'll keep looking for a sugar cookie recipe that's good all around, though.

Wow! This is the final sugar cookie recipe I will ever search for. The dough is perfect and the frosting was easy to use and sets perfectly for decorating. I want to say thank you for listing this wonderful recipe. Make a double batch because they do not last long.

Very good cookie for extra large cutouts-cooks flat and are yummy. Recommend the 1/4" thickness. They taste better and are softer. Haven't tried out frosting yet but will.

I made about 9 dozen of these cookies.  Some I frosted and some I left plain, they were all excelant!  It was really easy and the cookies stay nice and soft.  The frosting is not so great until it hardens.  Then it becomes awsome!

Think I added too much baking powder as they rose like muffins, or "maybe I'm a terrible cook". I would lower the amount of b/powder & leave the dough longer in the fridge, But they tasted great...My family loved them!!! Thumbs up

This cookie was easy and everyone loved them.  I got so many rave reviews.  I told them right where I found this recipe.  It's a hit for anyone who knows a little about baking.  No problems at all.  Soft and chewy even days later.  I love them and will use them any time I need to make a cut out cookie.  Thanks Delilah for this nice and easy recipe.

I followed this recipe to a tee and they turned out GREAT!!!  The cookie has a great texture (not too hard, nor too soft).  The only thing I did differently was before I added the food colouring to the icing I seperated the icing into small bowls so I could have different colours.

This cookie was great! I would not suggest using whole wheat flour if you have any. There was too much icing, so this time I only did half the icing for it, and it did great! This was all-in-all a wonderful recipie, thanks to Delilah Lopez!

Great recipe!  What makes these cookies even better is to only do 1/2 vanilla and the other 1/2 add almond flavoring.... or all almond flavoring!  The kids absolutely love them this way!

This is the BEST sugar cookie recipe I've ever used!  I subsituted almond extract for the vanilla, other than that I changed nothing.  The cookies were perfect, the dough was easy to handle... And people who I know to not normally care for cookies were coming back for seconds and thirds!  Thanks for the recipe!

My 5 year old and I made these for Santa. Overall it was a good recipe, the cookie tasted a little too much like flour to me. But the icing worked wonderful.  We had a great time with this one and will try it again next year.

Great cookie!  This is about the fifth sugar cookie recipe I've tried, and I will stop here.  It's so easy and great tasting.  My daughter and I sit and make a huge mess decorating these and have to make sure to save some for later.

The cookies turned out perfect, nice and soft and tasted great. The frosting, however, was a bit too sweet. We'll have to find a healthier and less sweet alternative, if one exists. Overall, pretty good though!

I have been making this recipe for a few years and it is fabulous. Recently had to go gluten-free so tried it with King Arthur Measure to Measure flour. The resulting cookies were as good as with wheat flour. So happy to be able to continue to use this recipe as sugar cookies are a family tradition.

Very tasty cookies, I added a splash of milk to thin the frosting as the kids were breaking the cookies. It turned out very great though! Just a handful of flour when rolling the dough out kept the dough from sticking too much

Relatively easy to make with the kiddos and a good ratio of frosting to cookie that allowed me to give each kid their own bowl of frosting to use. Much frosting was secretly devoured, I'm sure, but all the cookies ended up with frosting.

This is a great recipe. I think the butter flavored shortening is the key. I also added 1/2 tsp almond extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract instead of the full teaspoon of vanilla. I refrigerated the dough for one hour and fifteen minutes. Rolled them out in waxed paper that I  lightly floured. Thickness is important to prevent burning. I had a ton of compliments from the shower attendees. This recipe is now a family staple.

We pan-cookied these.   I greased & floured the rimmed cookie sheet & baked at 400 for 15.  'Sprinkled with red sugar first.  Immediately after removing from oven, hit it with the cookie cutters.  'Took the non-heart parts out first then the hearts to cool on a wire rack.  Initially, I thought these were going to be cakelike or soft, but they're just a bit thick & firm without reaching the hard point.  Flavorwise, o-kay.  They "did the job".  Oh, I forgot the milk & added 1/4c more flour.  K made for A, Valentine's day 2016.

excellent cookie and frosting recipe. the longer you refrigerate, the easier the dough will be to work with! cookies are soft and frosting is delicious. my husband asked for a traditional sugar cookie and he said these came out exactly like what he was imagining! they were all gone before I even got to decorate them properly!

This was a fabulous recipe for both the cookie and icing! I only baked the cookies for 5 minutes and they were the perfect texture- soft and moist. The icing hardened quickly and nicely. Everyone loved them! Thank you!

Just made cut outs for Easter with my 3 year old and this recipe is FABULOUS!!! I did not have a problem with the dough sticking to the cutters or falling apart when trying to put them in the cookie sheet like I have with other recipes! This is my new favorite and the taste is delicious as well!! Thank you!!! (I didn't have butter flavored shortening so used 1/2c butter and 1/4 c shortening and still turned out wonderful!!!)

I could not make shapes because the dough just fell apart. The dough was sticky and flour did not help.  I rolled the dough and just made round cookies. They were very good like that. Maybe it was me not using a correct technique for rolling out the dough?

The dough was delicate. This is first time I struggled with cut outs. I went heavy on the powdered sugar which helped a little. I sprinkled sugar on. I think I might add more sugar if I didn't use the hard icing. As it is its not a very sweet cookie.

This rating is for the icing only, I loved it, made some stiff for piping and some thinner for dipping the cookies before sprinkles. The butter and vanilla give it flavor, I did add a pinch of salt.
As to the cookie recipe...no one should consume the hydrogenated oil in shortening :o

Very easy, basic, yummie cookie. Easy to roll out after chilling well and as recommended using a lightly floured surface and rolling pin. The frosting adds just enough extra sweetness and are fun for kids to decorate. A keeper in this family.

*Note: I'm only reviewing the icing/frosting."            I've made the frosting by following instructions and it took forever to finally set. When it finally did set enough, it didn't harden as I thought it would. It would not stand room temperature and it had to be refrigerated the whole time.

I made the frosting exactly as its explained here and it looks that it takes for ever to dry out completely!- is still all mussy at the center-. I needed to be able to stack the cookies to put them in a box and I am getting really afraid because I am not seeing this working out! I am going to wait and leave them to dry overnight, if they don't I am going to be super pissed for have chosen this recipe!

I used the frosting recipe for the cookie to frost some other valentine cookies I made!  Delicious!  Perfect!  It was the right consistency and dried hard.  I painted the frosting on with a barque brush.

This recipe was a hit for Christmas. Even my dad who doesn't like cutouts loved them. And my grandpa and brother who are very picky raved about them as well. (Apparently the men in my life are hard to please.) The only change I made was instead of using vanilla extract for the frosting, I used almond extract. YUM!

These cookies aren't too bad. I made another batch, "Thick Cut Out Cookies" from this site, and I prefer them as they aren't as sweet as these cookies. Don't get me wrong, these cookies taste good, just my preference! This dough was very easy to work with.

I made bra cookies for my office's breast cancer fundraiser, and everyone raved! My low carb version was the favorite. I replaced half the sugar with the sweet'n'low equivalent. It's time to make Christmas cookies now, and this recipe is my instant go-to! Parchment paper is a must as well. The cookies brown lightly on the bottom if at all.

This review is just for the cookies, I've never been a big fan of the hard frosting, but the cookies were amazing!! Very firm, but still soft! They do puff up a bit, so if you're using a more intricate cookie cutter, you may lose some of the details, but this wasn't an issue for me since I used a basic star shaped cutout. These are wonderful, from now on this is my go-to sugar cookie recipe!!! Thank you for sharing!!

I thought these were fantastic.  I'm really not a huge fan of sugar cookies, but these were tasty and I thought the dough was really easy to work with.  I refridgerated them for exactly one hour and followed the recipe exactly.  I'll definitely make these again.

Excellent!  The only changes I made were to use regular shortening, not butter-flavored, because that's all I had, and I added much more milk to the frosting because mine was extra powdery.  It's so nice to find a cookie and frosting recipe that's easy AND tasty!  I'm looking forward to making them many more times, and hopefully I'll have the butter-flavored shortening on hand.  A must-try recipe!

I found these to be really easy.  The dough didn't give me any trouble, I just made sure to keep sprinkling flour on my roller and on the dough itself as I rolled it out.  My 4 year old helped with the rolling and cookie-cuttting, we both had fun!  I gave it my own little twist by adding the zest of 1 whole tangelo to the dry mixture before incorporating with the wet.  I also added a bit of zest and about 3 tsp of tangelo juice to the frosting, adding more confectioners sugar as needed to get the right consistency while keeping a citrusy flavor.  They turned out absolutely delicious!

These cookies taste spectacular and plus they are easy to make. Also most of the ingredents are in your pantry so you don't have to go to the store and get the supplies. I would say these cookies are great for any occasion.  I just made some christmas cookies out of them, they turned out great.  These cookies are easy and fun to make plus they are a great way to spend time with family!!!

Although the dough was a little sticky, adding flour to it while rolling it out solved the problem. The frosting only took about 1.5 tbsp milk to get the right consistency. Me and my son enjoyed decorating these cookies and they had a good flavor.

My kids happily devoured these beautiful cookies. We made santas and Christmas trees. The dough was a breeze to work with. I mixed up the dough the night before and put it in the fridge. The frosting was fairly easy to work with, hardened up nicely and tasted great. The cookies themselves did not taste very good to me. I think the butter shortening had an overbearing taste; I used crisco sticks. Next time I will use this frosting and go with a recipe that calls for butter instead of shortening.

I didn't think I liked these kinds of cookie's because I've had them before and they've always been gross.  But we wanted something to do with my nieces and they love all sugar and omg, they were delicious!  I'll make these again, even if my nieces aren't over.

I had many problems with this recipe. I as well had to keep adding flour due to the fact that the dough was tooooo sticky! As for the baking time, we only baked ours for 5 min, 8 min will burn the bottoms unless you make them way too thick! The worst part was the icing I thought it would be really great to make icing, next time I do it will not be this recipe. Little does anyone say how their icing after beating it with a mixer or by hand has little clumps of powdered sugar in it. You can see it in some of the photos and it makes the cookies look unattractive after you icing them. Even after 10-20 minutes of trying to mix this i still had little clumps. So proceed with caution.

Very good! The texture is PERFECT. I thought the dough was too crumbly at first, but I realized I was trying to roll it out too thin - once I did the 1/4 inch thickness the recipe calls for my problems were gone. There is a *slight* taste of fake butter, but unless you're looking for it you won't even be able to tell. Even with that, this will be the recipe I use for all of my cut out cookies. Didn't bother with the frosting.

The dough tasted great. The biggest dissapointment was that they puffed up too much distorting the shapes.  I can't comment on the frosting b/c there was no sense in making it since the cookies looked like big blobs. This might be a great dough for snickerdoodles.

I made these for my guys at work for the holidays and they absolutely loved them! They were a little sticky and difficult to roll at first, but after using a little flour on the rolling pin and making sure I used enough flour on both sides of the dough, they rolled and cut perfectly. Plus they were fun to make.

I got compliments all day on how great the cookies were from co-workers.

I'm sorry to go against everybody enjoying this cookie. I followed the recipe exactly, and the dough was too sticky to roll out or use cutouts. After adding quite a bit more flour, I could roll it out but still had problems with the cutters. Then, when they cooked they puffed up so much that I could barely tell what it was anymore. If you're only using these for round sugar cookies, the taste is fine but I don't recommend to use for cutouts.

This is a great cookie to work with! The dough was smooth, we were very limited with decorations so broken-up suckers were used & colored confetti was used, we did run out of icing b/f we were done all, surely you could double the icing, to me it makes a small amount but they are still good cookies & icing!!!

This is a great recipe and the frosting steals the show.  They are a fair amount of work to decorate neatly, but they are worth it in the end.  They are very similar to the bouquet type cookies you can order, I just wish I could make mine look that good.  Just as tasty though!

These were really good...I used margarine instead of shortening and it worked fine...

I also only had red and green food coloring so i used grape jelly to get purple; it made great easter cookies!

This recipe was wonderful!  Everyone loved it.  Instead of using butter flavored shortening, I substituted butter and regular shortening like others had done.  The icing was a bit thick so I haded a few tablespoons of water which worked great.  Thanks a lot.  Every last cookie was eaten!

If you need to make a good gluten-free cookie, swap the regular flour in this recipe for Beth's All Purpose Gluten-Free Flour cup for cup and its absolutely positively wonderful. Make sure to use pure vanilla extract too!

This is a wonderful recipe for cut out cookies. We didn't use the icing this time, used sprinkles instead. I like the amount this recipe makes. My husband, children and friends loved them. Will make again!

Great cookies! I refrigerated the dough for around 2 1/2 hours - it was really easy to work with and went a very long way (we baked what we needed and froze the rest of the dough). My little girl LOVED decorating the cookies. Husband thought they were good but a little dry, I didn't notice and thought they were lovely. I will bake again.

Very yummy! I've been making that frosting for years too, except I don't use any butter. The only difference I noticed with using the butter was the frosting was shinier...and more fattening! So I left the butter out there, the cookies are great though!

Absolutely the best sugar cookie out there!! Everyone raved about these, they are crispy on the edge and soft in the middle-YUMMY! Putting the dough in the freezer overnight made a world of difference in the ease of working with the dough.

These cookies tasted great and my kids loved making them, however the dough was WAY too pliable and the first round of cut-outs had to be re-rolled. I don't know if this was because I haven't made cut-out cookies in years and it was me or what, but we added more flour to the table and roller and tried again and we had success!

Wanted to try a new cut out recipe and should have just used the one I had.  I made it all exact as recipe and the dough was just too sticky for me.  Just too hard to work with for me.

Thank you for this classic and simple sugar cookie recipe!  My Halloween cookies disappeared faster than the adult punch did.  I made no changes to the recipe, it was lovely as is.

We found these to be very bland.  I imagine they would be better frosted, but we were so disappointed in them we didn't want to take the effort.  We'll try a different recipe next time.

I have never reviewed anything but after making these cookies I had to.  I did not frost them but the cookies were perfect.  My only advice as others said was to freeze the dough you were about to use and keep it in the freezer when not working with it.  Also, when rolling out the dough, do so between 2 pieces of wax paper, and bake on a wax paper covered cookie sheet.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

The cookies held their shape well, but were too salty.  Plus, 400 degrees is too hot, maybe try 375.  They browned way too fast.  The dough wasn't particularly easy to handle.  It was very soft.  Possibly putting it in the freezer could help.  All in all, I think I will look for a different recipe.  I probably won't make these again.  Sorry!

I followed the recipe exactly. These tasted like heaven but the dough was difficult to work with. I only chilled it for two hours and it was too soft so I stuck it in the freezer for twenty minutes. After that it was incredibly cold, but still very soft and very difficult to cut shapes out of.

I had issues with rolling out the dough. I put it in the freezer for a while to harden it, which helped for a few minutes, but then had to roll out and re-freeze the rest to start over again.

These turned out beautifully! I had to add a bit more flour but that could be because of the humidity right now. To roll them I put baking paper on my counter and then floured it. Make sure to use a lot of flour so that the cookies don't stick to the surface. Also, 200 C was too hot. I dropped the temp to 180 C (350 F). Great!

Even after leaving this dough in the fridge for more than 2 hours, I still had trouble rolling it out.  I gave up on the idea of cut outs and decided to just do round sugar cookies.  And they turned out just fine.  
This is a good sugar cookie recipe, but I couldn't make it work for my cutouts.

I too had unruley dough....which when I added more flour, it made them too floury...which was a good thing because it really balanced out the sugary frosting.  I loved how "cakey" these were...good cookie, the kids enjoyed frosting and decorating them.  Thanks Delilah!

Very nice cookie taste.  I added 1/2 teaspoon almond extract to cookie dough and 1/2 teaspoon almond extract to icing for extra touch.

I love the frosting for this recipe.  It's great for taking cookies to people and being able to stack them.  So yummy too!

Oddly, no one liked these at all. Not husband, 9 yr old daughter or even the dog. Dough turned out nicely, sticky but easy enough to work with - and they baked up well - but had an odd lemony flavor. If I made them again I'd add some lemon and frost with a lemon icing and call them lemon cookies. They just weren't at all what we wanted in a sugar cookie - sorry.

Very nice sugar cookie recipe.  If a cookie doesn't have chocolate I usually am not interested and only made these to have cut outs for christmas.  I loved these!  Both the cookie and the frosting had wonderful tastes.  It made quite alot and would cut the recipe in half next time.  Alot of people had difficulty with the dough.  I worked with small batches and after I cut out enough for one batch I put the dough scraps back into the refridgerator and pulled another chilled one out. It was my husband's first time frosting cookies and he said it was "just like spackling" and he did a great job.

I was in a pinch one night before my son's x-mas party and tried this recipe. I was still in a pinch after I tried it. The dough would not form at all! I added more flour but it did not help.

These cookies were great, once I figured out how to work the dough. I chilled the dough for 4 hours hoping it wouldn't be so delicate but it didn't work. You really have to have a soft touch with this one. It is important to have the right thickness to have a smooth transition from countertop to baking sheet without ruining the shape of the uncooked cookie. Regardless of its delicate nature, a great cookie. Soft and chewy.

These were good-light and chewy.  They did harden up however pretty quickly, but that was probably due to my error.  I accidentally used baking soda instead of baking powder, but they still turned out okay!

This was fabulous. I've never made sugar cookie dough from scratch, I ussually use the pillsbury roll, but this was easy and the kids LOVED it.

The dough was not a problem at all and I really didn't run into an sticky problems.  I used butter rather than the shortening (I didn't have any shortening)  The flavor was good and with the frosting these made wonderful cookies.  We used them to make christmas tree, snowflake, and candy cane cookies.  The thicker you roll it the softer the cookie turns out.

I used wax paper to roll it out on but found I didn't even need wax paper over the top. This is def. going into our recipe files and will be are fav cookie cutter cookies!!  Thanks for sharing.

Just made this today for Christmas.  The recipe was very easy and came out very well.  Great taste, although I didn't do the frosting.  My only suggestion would be to refrigerate for longer than the suggested time.  The dough is rather gooey and hard to work with if not chilled quite a bit.  Other than than, a big hit.

I was disappointed in these cookies.  The dough was very sticky and greasy.  I had to add flour to it to make it at all workable, and because of that the flavor and texture were not great.

This dough is very easy to prepare, but I found it a little difficult to work with.  I used plenty of flour and the dough still kept falling apart.  It did make nice cookies, and the frosting sets up nicely.  I like my sugar cookie with a little more flavor, but overall these were good.

I have made these again and again and they always turn out perfect.  The best sugar recipe I have ever made!  The cookies taste great and the dough is easy to work with.  The frosting is also easy to work with and once it hardens, the cookies can be stacked for storage.  Everytime I make these, someone asks for the recipe.  Thanks!

I don't know what happened with these. I keep reading over the recipe to make sure I did it right. The dough was really greasy to work with, despite adding more flour (and it had been in the fridge for hours, so it wasn't that it hadn't chilled enough). The cookies were hard even though I didn't cook them long enough to brown. Icing was so-so.

I absolutely love baking cookies in my free time, although ironically I am not much of a cookie eater myself.  However, I have a family that surely is.  After I made these cookies, everyone went crazy for them.  I had to make more the same day!  I cut them into the shapes of stars, and put yellow and pink frosting on them, and the kids loved them!  great recipe, generally easy dough to work with. Surely a keeper!

I thought the cookies were bland and the frosting just tasted like powdered sugar. I added a little lemon flavoring to the frosting which helped quite a bit but I won't make these again.

Outstanding cookie for making cutouts. I made a batch for my son to take to daycare and they were a hit ... of course kids will eat just about any cookie. To be sure, I took the extras to work and the tray was empty in minutes. Several people commented about how good the cookies were, and my co-workers are not polite by nature.

I did screw up the frosting, but it still tasted great. Attempting to double the amount of frosting, I used 4 tablespoons of butter, 2 teaspoons vanilla, 5 cups sugar and 6 tablespoons milk. I quadrupled the butter (math skills: not so good), so the frosting never got rock hard. It had a nice firmness on the outside, but soft and creamy underneath.

With this recipe, I think I have finally convinced my wife that we can stop buying tubes of sugar cookie dough. Ugh.

These were relatively easy to make and had great flavor. They were gone in 2 days. We ate them before they made it to our family get together. The only challenge I found was the frosting. I followed the directions, and it just seemed real chunky. My decorations wouldn't stick to it, but I definetly will make these cookies again!

Pretty good recipe. Not the best I've had, but still quite good. I wanted to try a new recipe just for fun, but I think I'll stick to my old recipe. No real complaints though, and the dough is easy to handle.

These cookies were very easy to make, and very yummy! Tasted just like the ones my mother use to make during christmas. I however didn't have shortening so I replaced the butter flavored shortening with unsalted butter.

Very good sugar cookies! But do not bake them 8 mn, 6 mn is enough. I almost burned my 1st batch, but it's my fault I should've checked after 5 mn.

I actually didn't have shortening so I used one cup of butter in place of it.  It was fine and allowed me to be very generous w/ the flour when rolling.  My kids love them; they are soft and delicious!

Very good.  My daughter (7) and I split the frosting between 5 bowls and made different colors then decorated the cookies.  Great tasting and fun to make!

Very good cookies. Very easy to make and flavorful. Not too sweet and just right! I didn't use any food coloring though since I used my frosting instead. Still good!

These tasted like your average sugar cookie. They were fun decorating and all for the holidays and they were soft which is what I was looking for.  I'll keep looking, however won't mind using this again either.

The cookies were okay, but the icing never got hard for me. :o I made the cookies a few weeks ago though, so I may try again and see if I did something wrong.

I would not have called these "sugar cookies" since they are not sweet at all and taste strongly of baking powder.  Neither my kids nor I liked them.  I give this recipe two stars only because the dough was easy to roll and cut out (roll between 2 sheets of wax paper; works great with little mess!)

I give these cookies 5 stars as far as being great dough for cookie cutters; however, as far as taste, I give them 3 stars.  They are a bit bland.  They need more flavor; not sweet enough.  Made dough the day before and put it in fridge overnight.  It worked great the next day to make cut-outs.  Used icing on some of the cookies, and it was delicious.  My son loved the cookies, so that is what counts!

These were absolutely the best sugar cookies ever. I had to double the icing recipe, because I think I made the cookies on the thin side. But I've never found a sugar cookie recipe before this that was so easy and tasty. Thank you so much!!! :D

This rating is for the icing only..I made sugar cookie cut outs for the first time (using a great recipe from Taste of Home magazine)and used this icing...it was terrific! It dried to a nice shiny finish and was delicious! I was able to stack them for gift tins and the cookies looked great! I did have to adjust the milk ratio to spread the icing, but overall, this is a fantastic icing recipe! I will use this one for many years to come!

These cookies were great!  I made two batches of them and brought them into work and everyone is raving about them.  They were easy to make, although the dough did get a little soft.  I refrigerated the dough for over an hour then took about half out and worked with that and put the rest in the frigde to stay cold until I was ready for it.  The frosting came out perfectly - and dried so well. I will definetely make these again!

I usually stay away from cookies that you have to roll out because I never have much luck.  I made these cookies with my 3 year old and although the dough became soft very quickly they still turned out great.  You just have to work fast and keep the dough that you are not using in the fridge.

These cookies where a hit in my house.  I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies turned out nice and crisp and the icing was terrific.  It hardened very nicely.  The only reason I am giving this recipe four stars instead of 5 is because the dough was a little to soft and slightly difficlt to work with.  All in all thought this recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

The cookie dough was way too soft. I had trouble rolling it out and moving the cut outs to a pan. The frosting however was wonderful. It was so easy to spread and it dried to a really pretty shine.

I followed the recipe to a T, even got butter flavored Crisco for the first time in my life.  However, the dough was just too soft.  Even after refrigerating it overnight, it wouldn't stay stiff enough to make any decent cut-outs.  And they are not crispy on the outside.  They are more cakey that I like.  Still looking for a good sugar cookie recipe...

I have tried many sugar cookie recipes, and this is by far the absolute best. You can't eat just one. I skipped putting them in the fridge and they were still easy to roll out. My entire family loves them! Whenever I try anyone else's sugar cookies they don't taste like they have any flavor. This is the only sugar cookie recipe I will ever use.

These cookies are soooo good.  I have made two recipes for sugar cookies in the past 4 days.  This is the better recipe by far.  The only problem is that I can't stop eating them.  I made the recipe exactly as it was from Delilah.  The frosting is perfect!

I needed to make easter cookies for a girlscout meeting and decided to try this one....It turned out beautifully.  I made egg shape cookies with cookie cutter. I cheated though and used regular vanilla frosting and decorated them with my kids. Tasted great and had fun!

This is a FANTASTIC recipe.  I made them and they turned out gorgeous, not to mention tasty!  I frosted them with the frosting recipe included and they were just wonderful.  I actually cut out my friends' names with my ABC cutters and put them in cello bags for gift giving!  They loved them.  Thanks for a delicious recipe.

It was easy and tasted good, but not the best that I have ever had.  I didn't get any compliments on mine, although people ate them.  I had to chill mine almost 3 hours to get it to a workable consistency.
I will hold on to the recipe, because it was easy and it tasted good.

Great recipe.  Didn't change a thing.  Came in very handy keeping my kids busy during recent snow days.  Made the icing and divided it into several bowls and let them make their own colors.  With a box of 100 cookie cutters, they were entertained literally for hours.  Much better than play dough because they can eat their masterpieces!

Tasted just like the cut-out cookies I used to bake every Christmas with my gramma!  Made these for valentines day and decorated with cinnamon hearts, what a hit!  The only change I made was adding a bit of extra flour so they would roll out easier.  Will definitely make again and again.

Made these cookies for a baby shower.  Cut them out in the shape of a gingerbread man.  Decorated them and put a small pacifier in the mouth, (make the indent while the cookie is still warm and used frosting to make the pacifier stick.  Everyone raved.  They not only looked good, but tasted good

These cookies were great, even my husband who only likes cookies involving chocolate loved these. We will absolutely makes these again. 

I am not sure what I did wrong with the icing but all my cookies stuck together even after letting them set apart for hours.

These cookies are amazing! The first time I baked them was for my grade two class and refrigerated the dough and it was perfect.  The second time I made them for a bake sale and this time I put the dough in the freezer.  The dough was crumbly but I just 'played' with it for a while and it was fine.  The icing was also very easy to make and was perfect for a wild bunch of grade 2's to use! Thanks for sharing!

Awesome cookies! Followed the recipe to the letter and they came out perfectly. They are very flavorful, even right out of the oven. I used Crisco butter-flavored shortening and also used it to grease the pan. Will definitely use this as my primary sugar cookie recipe.

A good cookie - definitely the texture I'm looking for.  I used standard shortening instead of butter flavor and added butter flavor liquid to the dough.  A little bland but that can be easily fixed by adding more butter flavor or even almond flavor.  The texture is great and 6 minutes is the perfect time: raised but not brown.

These cookies are fantastic. Moist and a little crispy. I severd them for an Art Reception and they were a real crowd pleaser, people kept asking for the name of the caterer. I will definitely use this recipe again!

This is my first sugar cookie recipe.  It was pretty crumbly, but I was able to roll it out OK.  I don't have a real rolling pin so we used a tiny play-do rolling pin.  My boys thought it was so much fun!  Hopefully they won't try to eat the play-do next time.  I will try another recipe before I do this again to see if they are all crumbly.  They taste great.  That is the main point so I give it four stars.  Did not try the frosting.

These were OK.  They were a little on the dry side and a tad too crunchy (all the way through) for me.  When baking these cookies one needs to pay close attention because they tend to become brown quickly!  I don't think I'd bake these again.

I make these cookies every Christmas and I get requests for them all the time.  They are sticky, but I find if you leave them in the fridge for the hour or longer, it really helps.  Also make the cookies thick when cutting them out.  I've also tried dipping them in melted chocolate and that works great also.  I will keep using this recipe as long as there will be Christmas!

I love these cookies. I don't know about kids but everyone at my work loves these cookies.  I made them for Christmas and Valentines Day

I would have given all 5 stars if I was a bit better at getting the cut cookies off the table with out distorting the shape.  Thank you!

I made this for an "adults feeling young" party.  I only made the cookies, and then served the colored frosting on the side.  They got to decorate their own cookies and loved it.

However, they didn't always let the frosting harden, so there was a little goop around.  But it was fun.

Loved Them!! These are the BEST sugar cookies I have ever had. My husband would not stay out of them. I made them for Christmas and my husband ate most of them, I stayed up Christmas Eve making another batch!! I suggest making twice the recipe!! Wonderful!! The frosting was perfect, harded nicely so you can stack them and the dough was very easy to work with, I put it in the freezer for an hour first.

Really easy! The cookies turned out perfect. 
More cake-like than some sugar cookies which can be dry. Overall I was very satisfied with the recipe and would highly recommend it!
Thanks!
