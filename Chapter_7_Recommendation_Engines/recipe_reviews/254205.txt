Sicilian Pasta with Broccoli is a great and tasty dish with a slight kick of spice which is cooled by a glass of Cold Milk. This was so easy and delicious.  Perfect for weeknight meal.

This recipe was outstanding!  I could not find fresh Cayenne peppers, so I used a Serrano pepper instead.  I also added in some fresh minced garlic, and some of the pasta water to loosen it up!  It's a perfect summer pasta dish!

Delicious! I did reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking liquid to 'loosen' it up a bit at the end, but that was my only change. Great flavor and the family loved it! Paired great with a glass of cold milk~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I watched an episode of "Detective Montobano" recently and a character was making a dish of broccoli and ziti, so I thought I'd look up a recipe. This one has no garlic! But I liked the simplicity and fresh tomatoes, so I made a version by sauteing about 6 chopped "toes" of garlic, softly, not browned, before adding the cooked broccoli, tomatoes and pasta. The result was tasty but still a bit bland. Next time, more garlic, maybe some onion.

This was delicious! I added garlic and fresh cilantro, and used Parmesan cheese instead because thatâ€™s what I had. Would definitely make again!

Followed the recipe as written but it lacked flavor.  I wouldn't bother to make again to try to fix.

Really tasty, easy to make meal!  You can add anything you want to this to change it up. It was great as it is. Nice amount of heat and a glass of milk is the perfect pairing with this dish. Will definitely make again.

I thought it was too mild. I would have liked something more saucy. If you are after stronger flavor and saucier pasta this is not the one to go with. However, it was pretty easy to make and it does taste better with a glass of milk.
