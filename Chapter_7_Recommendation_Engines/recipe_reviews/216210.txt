This cookies are amazing!  I definitely recommend putting the dough in the refrigerator for about an hour before baking.  (If not you will end up with red hands and a gooey mess!)  Press them down for a more cookie-like feel instead of a "cakie."  I topped them with a homemade cream cheese frosting and dark chocolate shavings.  They were beautiful and delicious!  I plan on making them again for another Christmas gathering.

Made these for a party and were an absolute hit.  My only advice to others (given some of the less than stellar reviews) is NOT to overbake.  Cookies are moist, chocolately and delicious.

Awesome recipe, very easy to make and very yummy!! I used homemade cream cheese frosting and skipped the nuts (due to allergies) and all three of my children (they are 4, 19, and 21) loved them!! In fact I had to hide them so that I'll have them for my cookie trays :-)

I am not impressed with this one at all.  Actually, we just threw the rest of the batch away.  Hate to say it.... I followed the recipe just as it was written out but the cookies just tasted dry and the cocoa flavor was a bit over powering.  I might have been expecting a bit much wanting a piece of red velvet in a cookie, but I just couldn't seem to get the red velvet flavor from this one.  I would not recommend this, Sorry...

We're on batch #3. :) After the first one, I added an extra teaspoon each of butter and sour cream and chilled the dough before baking. I flattened the balls slightly since they were pretty firm. If you didn't like these, you baked them too long or didn't mix it well. This is the best cookie recipe of the season. I added green color to the frosting to make them Christmas-y.

I really hoped this recipe was going to live up to my expectations. I was hoping for more of a red velvet cake like cookie. I agree with another member who said the cocoa flavor was a bit overpowering. Other than that, there wasn't much flavor. They weren't overcooked either, so I know it wasn't the problem. I made these for a pot luck Christmas party. They weren't the biggest hit at the party. I only made one batch, and after a party of about 40 people, I still had about 1/3 of the batch left.

These are very easy and so good! They came out pretty small for me... and instead of chopped nuts on top I just put half of a pecan.

Very easy and pretty but not much flavor. They don't taste bad, they just have very little taste.  I think with some minor adjustments they could be great!

These cookies are so delicious, and pretty easy to make.  I took the suggestions of a few other reviewers, and it helped immensely.  One thing I did was put the dough in the fridge for at least an hour before I baked them, unless you want uber-sticky dough and completely red hands afterward.  Another suggestion I used was to flatten them slightly on the pan before I stuck them in the oven, which really helped to bake them evenly.  Lastly, instead of nuts, I dark chocolate shavings on top.  I thought it really added to the flavor of the cookie, and made them so pretty!

I made these cookies and brought them to work and they were a hit. Some people said they were expecting more "red velvet" in these cookies, and I think if you want real red velvet just make a cake. Cookies are completely different. The only thing that makes these cookies red velvet is that they're red and they have a cocoa taste. I made them with cream cheese frosting and I decorated them with Christmas sprinkles and they turned out really well. I may not have cooked them long enough though becasue some of them kind of stuck to the baking sheet, but I really didn't want to accidentally burn any. The sugar cookie mix made these really easy to prepare.

I made these cookies because my husband & brother-in-law LOVE Red Velvet cake.  They were gone so fast from the cookie tray that no on else got a chance to try them!! The only change I did was I followed the advice of others & chilled the dough for an hour before rolling, I think it could be refrigerated longer, the dough was still a bit sticky.  Also since it was a bit sticky, to avoid red hands I wore gloves (the type for medical use or deli workers are fine).  I made some with nuts & some without because my nephew is allergic but who knew he never had a chance to try them.  Sprinkling green sugar sounds like a good idea, I think I will try that with some from the next batch.
The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star was because of how sticky the dough was to work with

Delicious and easy.  I followed the recipe as written except used the Andes peppermint chips as a topping instead of nuts, just for a Christmas touch.  This will be a repeat for me; I plan to use the recipe over and over.  Makes a dressy cookie for gifts, too.

These cookies are AMAZING!!  I found the dough sticky and had to used flour on my hands. But other then that the best cookies I have ever had. So so very easy to make.

The dough is so sticky that even after chilling it for over an hour there was no way I could roll it into balls.  I ended up just dropping spoonfulls on the cookie sheet.  The end result tasted ok, but defintely not worth the mess.  I won't make these again.

i am amending my origial review which is below.. i thought they were hopeless because out of the oven they are horrid rocks.. but i tossed them in a zip bag for about 3 days, they softened up and got a flavor.. my thoughts are the red food color and the 'mix' you make them with don't react well AT ALL.. making them bitter, flavorless, just sweet,  very dry. hard round oyster crackers types after only 8 min in the oven at 375 NEW oven just like the directions....  didn't rise, didn't spread out at all,,, and frosting is too thin so no packing them up to take anywhere without all the frosting falling off.. sorry betty.. a good thought....so.. flatten before putting on cookie sheet because they don't budge.. and cool then store 2 days or so in an airtight bag or box. then frost and put in fridge.. i know this calls for a box mix, but make them from scratch instead since its not that much more work that all this.. . then canned frosting is still doable..

I agree with other post to place batter in refrigerator prior to rolling cookies.

I am very surprised by the positve reviews on these. I followed the recipe exactly.  I made 11 new types of christmas cookies, and this is the only one I will never make again.

I thought these were delicious! However, I also found that an entire tablespoon of red food coloring made them a little too dark for me, so I will cut down next time I make them.

I didn't care for them. What got me on these were their consistency. They weren't cakey or cookiey (sp?) to me. I just don't know how to explain it. Very, extremely dense...maybe? The cocoa was a little stronger than what I was expecting but I could live with that. I knew I wasn't going to end up w/mini red velvet cakes, but, again, the consistency is what turned me off. Hubby loved them, 5 yr old didn't (but she's picky), 3 yr old loved the frosting (licked it all off his cookies lol). The recipe is SUPER easy and fast which is a plus. But I just don't know if I'll make these again.
