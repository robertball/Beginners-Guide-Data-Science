I've made these a couple times now. Very good but the cooking temp was way too high ( for my oven anyhow). I added the zest of the lemons for a richer lemon flavour.  I even put them on parchment paper to try to keep the bottoms from burning. I will cook these again but at a much lower tempature.

These scones were so easy and quick to make that I was done in about 30 minutes start to finish.  They were light, fluffy and not overly sweet.  A winner at our house!

Overall, pretty good scones. The dough was very loose and definitely had to be kneaded several times.

I really like the combo of sweet and tart here.  I tasted the dough before baking and thought it needed a little more tart, so I added 1/4 teaspoon lemon extract and kneaded it in.  The dough is pretty loose, so kneading it a few times on a floured board is needed.  Very tender and flavorful scone resulted.  A real keeper!

Added lemon zest as others suggested.  Everyone loved these.  Served with Devon cream from this site.  My mom said they were better than the local bakery scones we love.

I’ve made this recipe twice now. First as written and they were fluffy but kind of bland. The second time I added 1/4tsp lemon extract and honestly I think could add 1tsp instead. The only other thing I’ve done different is that I don’t roll mine out. I hand form them into a 3inch roundish shape and about 1/2 inch thick. I also bake on a non stick baking mat.  I like that these are fluffy and I will definitely try them again with new adjustments. It’s a great base recipe.

I made this recipe as written, but tasted the dough before rolling out. There was absolutely no appreciable lemon flavour. So I kneaded in about 2 tbls lemon juice, 1/2'tsp of lemon extract, and the zest of a lemon, with a little more flour, then shaped and baked them, for 16 minutes at 375. They are good... but not great. Still not enough lemon flavour for my taste. Next time I will add more zest and more extract. The baked well, though - light and fluffy.

Very good.  I added lemon zest and some almond extract  to liven it up a bit.
