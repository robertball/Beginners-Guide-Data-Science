A good quick and easy recipe. I used frozen spinach instead of celery and added a couple tablespoons of chopped onions for flavor.

Very good! I scaled mine down to 1 serving and added ham. The ham made it absolutely wonderful. Since I used skim milk I drizzled some half-and-half over it. Very rich tasting and although it looked like a small serving in the bowl it was more than enough and lasted all morning. The only downside was that it took me 30 minutes to make it.

this was easy to make but I did not like the flavor at all. I love celery and love oats just not together.

I cook it without celery Sugar instead of salt (4-5 tablespoons) and let it simmer for at least 10-15 minutes.

I was pleasantly surprised by this soup. I am not partial to sweet breakfasts and I am supposed to be eating more whole grains oatmeal for breakfast the doctor said! I did add some pepper and a little extra salt at the end of cooking. Would also be good with a diced egg on top. I can't say that this will be a dish I reach for BUT I will definitely make it again.

I give this recipe 3 stars as it is written. The first time I made it it was really yummy but a little too salty for my taste and also not quite as filling as I had hoped. The second time I made it I used almond milk instead of regular milk I did not add any salt I added 2-1/2 cups of chopped celery. I cooked as instructed then let it cool overnight in the refrigerator (this takes it from soupy-runny to THICK). Then in the morning I added 1 cup of frozen berries and heated it up for about 2 minutes in the microwave. One serving was 277 calories and I was stuffed! thanks for the great base recipie idea. I think I now have a new breakfast staple.

I donâ€™t like milk, so I used vegetable stock & omitted the salt.  Too lazy to chop celery, so I used 1 bag of frozen mix chopped celery, onions & carrots.  I also added 1 can of stewed tomatoes (14.5 oz).  This was so good that I had it every day for lunch.  This pot makes 3 full 20-oz soup mugs of only 211 calories each.
