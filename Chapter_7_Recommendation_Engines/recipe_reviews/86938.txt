Very tasty with the following changes. I sauteed cubed chicken breast in garlic, salt and olive oil beforehand. I added mushrooms to the recipe and sauteed them in olive oil, garlic and wine and then added the spinach and artichokes. I used marinated artichokes and added the liquid from the jar to the mix. Then add the cooked chicken and 1/2 to 3/4 of a package of dry italian dressing mix. This is key! Simmer for a few minutes before adding it to the orzo, pancetta and pinenuts. You don't need to necessarily add the balsamic vinegar at the end because there is tons of flavor but it is personal preference. Serve with grated parmesan cheese and YUM you've got a winner!

I just finished eating this for dinner.  It was very good.  I only used half the orzo the recipe called for and cooked it in chicken broth for added flavor.  I used marinated artichoke hearts instead of plain and rough chopped them to make the pieces smaller.  I used chicken broth in place of the wine and it was still tasty.  My husband is eating a second helping right now.  I will definitely make this again using the changes I made.  Thanks for a great base recipe.

This was tasty and easy.  Way too much orzo though. Cut that in half.
This recipe makes more than 4 servings.

This was my first time ever making orzo and this recipe was GREAT! But, I changed it quite a bit per the other users comments. Definetly would have been too much orzo, so I only used half a box. Instead of panchetta, I used bacon (I couldn't find any at the store)..which I saved and crumbled on top at the end. I didn't use the pinenuts. I used marinated artichokes (including all the juice in the jar) and added chopped up sundried tomatoes (but you can use fresh too). I added italian seasoning, (Mrs. Dash Tomato/Garlic Blend, regular italian seasoning, minced garlic, dried basil, and a whole packet of dry italian dressing mix) when sauteeing the chicken and veggies. The flavor combo was amazing. It was even better cold the next day. I will definetly be making this again:) Thanks.

This was very easy and light. We enjoyed the blend of flavors. THIS WAS OUTSTANDING WITH FETA CHEESE! Sundried tomatoes are great in it too. I would recommend the use of marinated artichokes, however; I used both and the marinated ones were much better. I also used some of the marinade in place of the balsamic vinegar, since hubby has not learned to adore it yet. Recipe was still yummy with the omission of spinach (didn't have any).

Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars are the alterations I made and that it still wasn't perfect.  But overall, love the idea and using fresh/organic ingredients.  Followed many other reviewers suggestions: Used Marinated Artichoke Hearts Added sundried tomatoes, black olives and ready to eat edamame Left out onions because none of us like them. Used turkey bacon instead of panchetta dbled recipe for dinner party but still used only 1 bag of pasta.  was perfect amt we served w/ rosemary rolls and ceasar salad. Balsamic was a little strong since there weren't any other seasonings used - was going to add packet of dry italian dressing but forgot - will definitely use it next time - wish there was a little more of a sauce - maybe add some corn starch to the liquid at the bottom to thicken it up? But loved the combo of ingredients and leftovers still tasted great - will make again - great for dinner parties with everyone bringing a side or appetizer since is a full meal in 1 pot.
****ammendment - 
Made this a 2nd time but halved it - added the italian seasoning packet and used balsamic dressing instead of vinegar - also used some corn starch to thicken sauce.  I liked it much better w/ the dry italian and thickening up the sauce - will stick w/ balsamic vinegar cause I like the strong flavor - left out chicken for vegetarians and didn't miss it - great veggie meal w/ lots of flavor!

This was a very delightful recipe.  We had a difficult time finding ORZO but once we did I would not cook it with anything else.  All of the ingredients mixed well with eachother - the artichokes, spinach, chicken, orzo, panchetta, and pine nuts combined together was sooooo tasty!  For next time I think I will include a little more pine nuts and panchetta.  Be careful not to overcook the orzo because it is liable to fall apart very easily.

Waaaaay too much orzo. I did not use red pepper flakes or bacon, and maybe due to that, the flavors where not unified until I added two cups of freshly shredded parmesan cheese. It is a great way to use leftover chicken and fresh spinach.

This is a very yummy and easy quick fix for dinner!  I like adding some sun-dried tomatoes (the red is pretty in the dish and adds a nice flavor).  DEFINITELY cut the orzo down to 1/2 what is called for, and I add more chicken.  The pancetta adds a wonderful smoky flavor, and the white wine is perfect.  EASY, DELICIOUS and a family fave.  What could be better??

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would!  I took other reviewers advice and used marinated artichoke hearts and added the liquid from the jar also.  I added a package of italian dressing powder, sundried tomatoes and feta.  Absolutely fantastic.  My husband and I both agree that this is one of our all time favourite recipes that we will be making again and again. Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!!

One Word: AWESOME! I absolutely loved this recipe. I am glad I read some of the other reviews before making it. I only used a half a box of the orzo(which was just enough) and I marinated the cubed chicken for 2 hours in some zesty Italian dressing with a tablespoon of hot sauce. At the end I put a tablespoon of corn starch in 3 tablespoons of white wine and a little water to thicken the wine sauce and let cool a little then drained it just so there was a coating of the sauce all over the chicken and spinach. I also used 3 strips of regular bacon cooked extra crispy b/c that is what I had.

I prepared as written except only used 1/2 of the orzo, added sea salt and I used pork loin (we were snowed in and without chicken). Husband liked and said he would definitely like to have it again sometime.

I also had to make alterations, but loved the end result...used 1/2 the orzo, actually used some beer and red wine vinegar for the liquids, and toasted almonds for nuts (each what I had on hand).  I've sprinkled some romano/parmesan on top and think it is delicious!

I thought the flavor was overly tangy, with both the balsamic and the artichokes.

This turned into a 2 hour disaster.  Made it exactly as written, except for used marinated artichoke hearts.  
Was very bland, hardly any "juice".  Was not good enough to serve, so I put more garlic, parmesan, black pepper in it, made a basic white sauce with more garlic and parmesan, combined the two, and finally it was decent. Will not make again, althought I like the basic idea.

My husband and I absolutly loved this recipe. I used a little chicken broth instead of using the water from the artichokes. I also used less spinach and added plum tomatoes halved.

Delicious!  Hubby asked for chicken and orzo and thought he was going to get a plain and bland dinner.  He was pleasantly surprised when I made this recipe for him and has asked for it to be in regular rotation.  Only change I made was to make half of the orzo and added some Italian seasoning when I cooked the chicken.  Thank you for this recipe!

This was very good.  My husband even ate it and he doesn't like artichokes.  We forgot the pancetta, but it was good without.  However, the balsamic was a little overpowering.  Perhaps it wouldn't have been with the pancetta.

Very tasty.  Would add sun dried tomatoes or regular tomatoes next time.  Marinated artichoke hearts would be excellent too.  Less orzo would work.  Great left over too.

I loved this recipe because of all the different flavors mixed together.  I would definately use less orzo next time, about half and just add more if you like.

I changed the recipe quite a bit (didn't have Orzo, so I made a side of risotto instead) but the basic recipe with the chicken, artichoke hearts and spinach was fantastic! Good combo of flavors, colors and textures. The pine nuts was an inspired addition.

It turned out very well. I think it borders on a fancy meal that didn’t take much time. It never said exactly what to do with the pancetta but I figured you just sprinkle that on top once you were serving it to keep it’s crispness. The pancetta really makes the dish.

You can make this same dish and just change the pasta form if you don't like the orzo. I sometimes switch with the farfalle pasta

This was fantastic.  I will make again and again.... I didn't have pancetta so I used a little bacon.  My finacee does not like vinegar so I omitted that and added a little lemon juice.  I also added some fresh mushrooms as I love them and had some that I needed to use up.  I used some of the juice from the canned artichokes.  Very good!  Thank you!

Very good!  Kept everything the same except I did not include pine nuts, used marinated artichokes and used 3/4 of the orzo.  Definitely will make again!

Excellent. I had dribs and drabs of all of the ingredients (except pancetta, which I substituted with prosciutto and the pine nuts which I left out) in the fridge from the past week's meals. I didn't measure anything, I just winged it!!! Will definately make again. Leaving out the chicken would also make this a nice side dish!

This was pretty good, but I added some roasted red peppers, greek olives and feta cheese.  That seemed to give it just the kick it needed.  Will make again!

I, too, used marinated hearts, and half of the orzo recommendation.  This recipe could have used more chicken, and I forgot to add sun-dried tomatoes, which would have been good.  I might try a heartier bacon than pancetta and more red pepper; it was quite mild tasting.  Overall, a classy presentation and something quite different.

Absolutely delicious!  Wonderful blend of many flavors.  I used half the orzo as many suggested, but I think I'd use more next time.  It's a keeper.

Pine nuts are key to keeping this dish from having too much of a mushy texture. Watch-out though, they go from browned to burnt pretty quickly, so keep an eye on them!

This was amazing. I added in asparagus and mushrooms. I also used leftover rotessire chicken. First time using orzo and didn't keep a close enough eye on it and burnt the bottom layer in the pan. Other then that it came out perfect and could have ate the entire thing myself!!!

Felt as if it was missing something, a creaminess maybe. The red pepper flakes added a nice heat and the wine gave it a touch of class. Next time I prepare it I will leave out the bacon, it was hard to find and I wasn't sure if I was cooking it all the way through. My boyfriend liked it and I did too but I felt like something was missing.

I recently made this dish when we had another couple over for dinner and it was delicious! The flavors are distinct yet not overpowering of one another. Orzo did stick together a bit, so I may add some olive oil to it when adding the balsamic.

I really liked the idea of these ingredients together, but I used marinated artichokes as some reviewers suggested and just wasn't crazy about the taste - needs some adjustment with the balsamic vinegar too.  I will probably try again, using mushrooms instead of artichokes and maybe just marinate the chicken with balsamic instead of making it part of the sauce.

This had great flavors, but the ingredient proportions seemed off.  way too much pasta and spinach, and not nearly enough pine nuts or red pepper flakes.  still, a great flavor.  next time I will add more pancetta, more artichokes, more seasoning and less pasta.

Wow this was really good. Had left-over Creole Seasoned grilled chicken, mushrooms, sundried tomatoes. Didn't have Orzo so I used Angel Hair. Didn't use the nuts. Mixed the Balsamic in with the chicken mixture. Really tasty, thanks.

I substituted rotini pasta for the orzo because I'm always looking for new pasta recipes.  We just felt like it was missing something.  Maybe the sun dried tomatoes would be a good addition.  I will try again but probably tweek it some more.

This is good.  I didn't have the pancetta, pine nuts or wine.  I added some sun dried tomatoes, and used the water that I soaked them in instead of the wine, I also added a bunch of salt, and some pepper (it was kind of bland without the bacon).  Also used 1/2 the orzo like suggested by others.  I really like this:)  I'm not much of a vinegar person, but it's not overpowering in this dish.  Thank you for this fun recipe!

This is a very good recipe and comes together quickly!  I didn't have any cooked chicken on hand so I marinated cubed chicken breasts in greek salad dressing then grilled them.  Deeelish!  I agree, too, with others who suggest cutting the orzo by half.

I got to say that I really didn't like this one, which suprised me.  I ended up fixing it with added garlic powder, parmesian cheese, and basil.  Also, I would save the cooked pancetta to sprinkle on in the end.

This recipe turned out very good - it had much more flavor than I'd anticipated.  Since all I had on hand was marinated artichoke hearts, I drained them and used in place of plain artichoke hearts.  I also used less pasta than the recipe called for.  We will definitly have this for dinner again.

First off I want to say I made changes suggested by others.  I  understand that this is not an ideal way to leave a review but,  after looking at the previous reviews, I figure we are already pretty far down that rabbit hole.  So here we go:  I added mushroom, jarred roasted red peppers, and the dry Italian Seasoning Mix.  It would have been too bland for my tastes otherwise.   I also used 1/3 of the orzo that was suggested in the recipe.  Both my husband and I liked this recipe but preferred it more the second day.  I will continue with the recipe but will make additions based on my tastes that day and based on what I have on hand.  It is a good recipe as it is but is adaptable to your 'self expression'.

The basic recipe and combination of flavors were very good.  However, I did make changes and in doing so, the meal takes a bit longer to prepare.  I sautéed 4 bone-in chicken thighs with skin.  After browned, I added the onion and garlic, and added sliced fresh mushrooms (about a half cup or so) (seasoned all with salt and pepper, as well as the red pepper flakes).  I then added artichoke hearts (using marinated hearts with some of the marinade) and the wine—covered, and braised while preparing orzo, till chicken was tender.  I added the spinach at the end with the orzo, and to finish off, added a drizzle of balsamic vinegar over the top.  Came out absolutely delicious!  My husband and son grated fresh Parmesan on top—I did not.  My husband and son loved the dish also.

This was so good I've made it for company - twice. Today we had leftovers and it was so hot outside that we ate it as a salad - cold over lettuce with diced fresh tomatoes and shredded cheese. Delicious! Great for my dairy free friend.

My whole family enjoyed this! I would not say that the flavor is robust, but it is in a nice meal. I followed suggestions from other reviewers, such as boiling the orzo (half of a box) in chicken broth (then I added a bit of the starchy broth to the final mixture). I started by cooking the cubed chicken in some olive oil with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and removed that to a plate. In the same pan, I browned honey ham cold cuts (since I didn’t have pancetta or bacon) and then removed that. Finally, in the same pan I heated olive oil and sautéed the onion, garlic and a dash of red pepper (since I have small kids to feed), then the white wine, the liquid from the jar of marinated artichoke hearts and let that simmer. Finally I stirred in the spinach, artichoke hearts, ham and chicken. Once the orzo was ready I combined everything and added some balsamic and toasted pistachios (since I did not have pine nuts). My kids enjoyed it, especially my 6 year old, which made me breathe a sigh of relief!!! I’ll probably make this again if I have orzo on hand.

It’s a good start but needs tweaking. I thought it was pretty bland. Even with 1/2 of the orzo, it was still too much in my opinion.  

I added black olives and feta cheese with a drizzle of balsamic to finish. 

I’ll keep this on the back burner for now while I think of ways to improve.

Love, love, love this recipe! It's become a family favorite. I just use whatever pasta I have on hand (generally rotini or mini shells which grab and hold the juices well), substitute bacon instead of pancetta (I just like bacon better), eliminate pine nuts (family member with tree nut allergy), and add in at least 1 to 2 tablespoon of capers (they bring the flavor to the next level, one time I forgot them and everyone noticed, I was reminded the next 3 times times I made the dish by helpful family members who were concerned of my omitting them again!)

Tasty, great if you have leftover chicken. But still good if you have to cook fresh chicken.

I added garlic salt and pepper and 3 cloves of garlic.  Added parmesan at the end.  It was good but I'll add more garlic and maybe not crisp the pancetta next time.

Delicious recipe. I used regular bacon instead of pancetta, I read the previous reviews and cut the orzo in half, it was plenty! Super quick and easy.

Loved this delicious recipe! I sauted seasoned chicken breast in the bacon grease before adding onion garlic and what-not. This is my first time cooking  orzo. It was good. I will make this again.

This was a very good, and easy dinner.  I didn't have cooked chicken, so sauteed cubed chicken breast in a little olive oil, then removed the chicken and sauteed garlic, onion, sun-dried tomatoes & sliced mushrooms.  I didn't have pancetta or bacon, so skipped that ingredient altogether and don't think it hurt the recipe.  From that point, I mostly followed the recipe.  I added about 1/4 C of the liquid from marinated artichokes and used only 12 oz. orzo.  I slightly under-cooked the orzo, so it would absorb liquids in the pan of vegees & chicken.  It came out perfectly.  I might decrease the orzo to 8 oz next time.  I would also like to try adding the dry Italian dressing mix other reviewers commented on.  All in all, a great dinner and one we will make again.

This was good and I will make it again.  I took the advice of  other reviewers and used half the amount of orzo called for and it was just right - 16 oz. would have been WAY too much.  I also used bacon and added more garlic due to personal preference.  I used rotisserie chicken and marinated artichokes, and as others suggested I added the juice too.  Next time I’ll try without it, as I thought it made the dish a little oily.  I also added the packet of Italian dressing mix when I added the wine.  I topped with chopped cherry tomatoes just before serving.  Lots of different add-in options with this one!

I love trying AllRecipes recipes - they usually are well designed and fun to prepare.  But I found the end product of this recipe did not justify the work involved.  Too bad - all the individual elements are some of my favourites, but the flavour of the assembled product just didn't come together.

We really liked this recipe. One thing I would say is that it is important to cook the orzo *last* as shown in the instructions. Otherwise it sits in the strainer too long and starts to bind together. But this is a very tasty dish!

My whole family loved it. I did about 1/2 cup less of the orzo, but loved the flavor.  I love dishes with different textures, and this had some of my favorite things!  Toasting the pine nuts in any dish is must, it  adds such a great flavor.

I also halved the orzo.  I should have added tomatoes to it , I did add some cream and Parmesan cheese to the recipe along with salt and pepper.  The red pepper flakes added to the recipe.

Very easy recipe! I omitted the sundried tomatoes and added Roma's at the end for flavor and color. I also used marinated artichoke hearts and the flavor was great. Next time I'm going to try regular bacon. I thought the flavor of the panchetta was lost with all the other flavors and regular bacon would hold its own better.  My husband, who is not an orzo fan, loved it. Cant wait to make it again! Oh, I used a spinach/arugula blend and it worked well too.

This recipe turned out exactly how I wanted it to—not too fancy or difficult to make but perfect  for  a tasty side dish or one bowl dinner. I will definitely keep this recipe in my ‘ company’s coming’ file. Would be great for a potluck, as it  makes an ample amount and could easily be doubled.

I think a full bag of Orzo was too much unless you were making a pasta salad . . . If so, the recipe really needs to bump up its seasonings because as it is it’s pretty bland.  More vinegar, more herbs, maybe use artichokes in oil.

Very good and versatile dish.  Thank you to other reviewers;  I followed suggestions with excellent results.  I used more garlic, marinated artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes,  and mushrooms in addition to the other ingrediants listed.  I halfed the orzo.  When serving sprinkled with the panchetta, pine nuts,  chopped parsley and grated parmesan.  Then drizzled with a little white truffle oil;  WOW.  Sounds like a lot of work and ingredients but everything went together relatively easy and the flavors worked very well together. Wonderful!

IF I make it again I would use only half of the Orzo.  It was way to thick and enough to feed a small army! It didn’t have much flavor but I did not use the bacon in it. That  to me didn’t sound good in the recipe.  Maybe some chicken broth would  be something to consider..

This was ok but it needed more flavor so I added some sun-dried tomatoes, cut the orzo amount in half and added some extra garlic and dry Italian seasonings.  It came out great.

I made this last night for dinner. The recipe is so easy and really did only take 40 minutes total. I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out, as you don't use much seasoning. I did add a bit of dried basil. I made this as is, except I used turkey bacon (to keep it lean), and sauteed two chicken breasts with the onion and garlic. However, I can see, as other users have, adding other ingredients; such as mushrooms, feta and sun dried tomatoes, or even fresh basil. This recipe is great for experimenting. Also, this recipe does not say what to do with the pancetta. Toss the pancetta in when adding the orzo.

I followed the recipe except for pancetta which I replaced with bacon and reduced the oil. I thought it was tasty. My husband thought it was just ok. To make it better, I would add more white wine simmering it down before adding the chicken.

We used perfect portions topped off with gruyere and baked with the pancetta slices. Made Orzo to recipe but sauteed the onion , artichokes and garlic with mushrooms, red,yellow peppers. One great dinner

Delicious.   I used the suggestions from the writer who said to add dry Italian dressing and marinate from artichokes.  This has to be one of the best quick meals I have made in a long time.  A definite keeper!   Very simple.

Great week night dinner! Made recipe as is. Used a rotisserie chicken, which gave the dish a nice flavor. Next time will add some feta cheese.

I really enjoyed this one.  I made it as written, and it had a good flavor, was fairly easy to put together, and the leftovers heated well.  

I'll definitely make again!

This was very good.  Less orzo as recommended by others.  I added frozen peas (nice colour and added veggie content), mushrooms, and marinated artichokes with some of the juice.  I used balsamic reduction instead of vinegar.  It really made it.  Will definitely make this again!!

This was great. I used Prosciutto di Parma and smoked chicken because that's what I had. The smoked chicken put it over the top, but plain chicken would still be really good I'm sure. Mushrooms might be a nice addition.

This recipe has been a regular in our house for a while now. We typically don't make it with orzo and just use a 13 oz. box of whole grain pasta; any pasta will do, this dish is about the other flavors.  Also, we sub 8 oz. of bacon for the pancetta.  :)  Sometimes we'll add a cup of chicken broth depending on how long it sits on the stovetop.

This was fantastic. I substituted bacon for pancetta (uncured). The flavors are incredible and it makes excellenet leftovers.  It also was fast and easy.  To make it even faster, I bought cooked grilled chicken from Trader Joes so this was a snap to make.

This had delicious ingredients all together but really didn't have any sauce.  By the time the wine reduced there was nothing left.  I added more olive oil and wine to try to get a sauce going, but I was left with a pretty dry pasta even with the other ingredients mixed in.  I will try some of the reviewer's suggestions next time.

I liked this, but I didn't like the calorie count.  There was no way I would make something with 700 calories a serving, so I left out the pine nuts and the bacon and added some roasted red peppers.  I added balsamic salad dressing in addition to a bit of balsamic, just because I think I lost some flavor without the bacon.  I cut the Orzo and also added some mushrooms and topped with goat cheese or parmesian cheese (we had it) My family enjoyed it, even the kids.  We will make again  (and it's a good excuse to open a bottle of wine)

Yum! I agree with everyone else, this is a keeper. I didn't have spinach but I love spinach so I can't wait to try it with that too. The flavor was wonderful. Hate onion so skipped that and didn't have panchetta so used bacon like some other reviewers. Actually fairly quick and easy, when I see this many ingredients I strart to shy away but this wasn't difficult at all. Going to try adding Feta next time too. Loved it!

very yummy and easy to make. I didn't feel that the red pepper flakes really added anything flavor, just spice. So next time I will skip them. I added feta and black olives, they were a great addition.

I liked the recipe although I could do with less onions.  It also needed something, but I couldn't put my finger on it.  Perhaps some cheese?  A little more bacon?  I noticed there was no salt/pepper in it and maybe that would have helped?

Used Foster Farms soy bacon for lipid reduction reasons.  Worked just fine.  Very good recipe.

This one was just ok for us.  I didn't add the spinach because my bag was in a sorry state.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  We love all the ingrediants just didn't like this combo.  Thanks for sharing.

This was okay, but I didn't really like the varying flavors.  Especially the balsamic vinegar...:(
