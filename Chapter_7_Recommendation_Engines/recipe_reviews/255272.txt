Great recipe, only changes I made were that I used mild Italian sausage instead of chorizo because I could get any at the time. I also added half a chopped sweet onion and 2 cloves of fresh minced garlic, some sea salt and pepper. But great recipe and very flavour full and I will definitely be making this again!

I have actually made this several times I usually incorporate adobo peppers, pinto beans, corn, as well as tomatillos to balance out the spice.  I also use this to make stuffed cabbage as well. One of the family favorites
