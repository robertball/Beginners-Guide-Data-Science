Wow! This recipe exceeded my expectations! We loved it! Per previous reviewers, I too used a food processor to quicken the process and added a little extra mayo and a TBLS of red wine vinegar.  Yum yum! Will be making for many parties and events to come!

Amazing dip. I tried it out on my Philadelphia family (Philly, if you dont know, is the home of the Italian Hoagie) We all agreed, it really does taste like a real hoagie.
I added more mayo and also added red wine vinegar at the end and I would say it takes much more prep time that 15 min, but boy was it worth it. It also keeps for a few days, so serve over a long weekend at the Jersey Shore!

Growing up north of philly there are 3 things I know from birth, real cheese steaks, stromboli's, and Hoagie's. I must say this totally hit the mark. I did add some vinegar to the mixture as any hoagie I've ever had contained it. It was terrific!. I did scale this down to 4 servings and it made about 2 1/2 cups of dip even then. I chopped all the meat and cheese up rather than tore, it was faster and more uniform. I will be making this again.

I looove Italian hoagies, so this is right up my alley.  I go the Strip District (Pittsburgh thing) and get quality meats and cheeses: ham, spicy capicola, salami, pepperoni, and provolone.  For the dressing: 1 cup mayonnaise, 1/4 cup sour cream, 1 T red wine vinegar, 2 T Italian Dressing, 2 t dried oregano. I like it cooked, but that's how I like my hoagies.  In which case I serve the onions, hot pepper rings, lettuce and tomato on the side.  I serve with lighly toasted french bread rounds.  Also, my friends call this "deconstructed hoagie."  I think it's an accurate description!

I cut this recipe in half, because it just seemed like it would make too much.  I am sooo glad I did.  The dip is great, but we would never have been able to finish all the dip otherwise.  Thanks for the recipe, I know it will be used again.

I have had this before and i was always asking for the recipe and no one wanted to give it up! Now i have it!!! This is great! I added blended olive oil and a little balsamic vinegar. I think next time i will leave them both out. It didn't really make that big of a difference. This was great! Also I ommit the onion. I don't like onion on my hoagie therefore i left it out.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and took it to a huge SuperBowl party with lots of college-aged folks and people did not like it.  I came home with 95%.  Will not be making this again.

I made this for New Year's Eve with a few tablespoons of red wine vinegar and it was terrific! It was a huge hit - over 30 people gave it a thumbs up! My brother-in-law told me I needed to make this for every gathering.

I have a card group in my home on occasion and served it.  It was a BIG hit.  My daughter took the leftovers to school with her and took a baggie of hoagie bread slices. My family loved it.  I used sliced American cheese and stacked it up to slice.  I also use home grown tomatoes.  I will make this alot more in the future.

This is SOOO good. Just a tip for cutting the cheese. If you're not using a food processer, Just take a sharp chef's knife and slice the cheese a half lb at a time in long horizontal strips. Then when you go to cut vertical (to make small chopped squares), cut on an angle. It seperates the cheese so it's not big blocks that you have to seperate with your hands. Just a small time saver. Thanks for this great dip, will be making next week for tailgating!!

I have been making this dip for years and agree that it tastes just like a hoagie.  However I use 1/4 lb. each of bologna, ham, Italian salami, American cheese and provolone cheese.  I pulse the meats cheese, lettuce and tomato (all separately) in a food processor.  That makes it finer - not as "chunky".  Haven't made it in a couple of years but might again for a Christmas party.

Excellent. Added a few tablespoons of sub oil to the mayo. Have served it in a glass dish and in a carved out loaf of bread. Prefer the bread presentation as it looks better, more like a submarine sandwich, but also it absorbs the mayo/oil and doesn't get all runny like it does in the glass dish. I mix up the mayo mixture and chop the meats/cheese a few days in advance so there's less to do on the day of the party.

A hometown favorite in Philly. A few suggestions to make it even better--1. roll one slice of cheese, ham and salami together to make a thin roll, then slice across. this tip not only makes for a more presentable    dip but also lessons the amount of mayo in every bit, which is good for those who are not huge mayo fans 2. unless you are serving this to italians, use hard salami, i think most people prefer it 3. try a 1/2 teaspoon of dill along with the oregano/mayo mix, it adds a great pickled flavor!

Wow!  This is excellent!  I followed other ratings advice.  I halved the recipe....makes a ton!  I used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream added dry Italian Dressing mix & red wine vinegar and used Provolone.  The I followed rest of the recipe.  It is delicious!  I can't wait to make this for my next party.  Thanks for sharing!!

We love this! I loved it as a kid, when one of my aunts used to make it, and I was so happy to rediscover the recipe here and find that my family still loves it.  You can easily adjust/doctor up this recipe to suit your own tastes... For me, being from So. Jersey, I like cutting the mayo with sour cream, adding plenty of oregano and Itianian spice, and a good amount of red wine vinegar -- it just wouldn't taste like a hoagie without the vinegar and oregano!  I have served this with fresh sliced baguette (though I do love the idea of hollowing out a round loaf for a bread bowl -- will have to try that). I also once heated up frozen rolls when I had bought everything in advance and couldn't get out the day of for fresh bread -- Alexia's makes some great ones (can't remember if they were French or sourdough) -- not cheap, but in a pinch...  Will be making this regularly, now that I have rediscovered the recipe!

Just awesome.  Made this for New Years Eve party and was a hit! Super yummy and everyone was saying how much it tastes like a hoagie. I put the tomato, onion and lettuce off to the side of the dip so it didn't get soggy or too wet. Served with crusty bread chunks. I used ham, genoa salami and provolone cheese. 
 P.S.
You can get away with using low fat mayo with this since the flavors are strong and you do not get the usual overwhelming tanginess the low fat stuff leaves in your mouth.

Great recipe! Everyone raved and said it tasted like "Cousins Subs" a local sub sandwich chain. I did use more mayo (& used light), red wine vinegar (1 TBL per cup of mayo). I prefer red onions over white and used provolone cheese, diced. This makes a lot so I took a reviewers advice and layered it like a taco salad. That way, IF there is any left the next day the lettuce isn't soggy. You have to try this!

We really enjoyed this dish. I set it up like a 'Taco Dip', and served with sliced fresh french bread. I did add a little red wine vineger in the mayo mixture. But I also drizzeled olive oil and oregano on top of the lettuce before serving. I will be making again, but I might try sliced turkey instead of salami.

I made a "trial- sized" version of this dip at home before taking it to a family gathering.  It was delish! However, I also made a few adjustments.  I cut back the mayo just a bit and added a amall amount of italian dressing and parmesan "shaker" cheese to the mayo/oregano mix.  I also added some hot pepper rings.  Like many others, I think this would be served much better in a bread bowl so it can absorb some of the oils and keep it from getting so soggy so quick.  Also, I tried to layer it by putting the lettuce and tomatoes around the edges.

Excellent! I halved the recipe and this still makes a ton. I used 3/4c. of low fat mayo, 1/2c. of low fat sour cream, and 1/2c. of fat free plain yogurt. I also used 1/2 a packet of good seasons dry Italian dressing mix, and 1 1/2tblspns. of red wine vinegar. I put all the meat and cheese (which I used Provolone in stead of American) in my food processor , I then also put the lettuce and red onion through as well...I hand chopped my tomatoes finely after de-seeding them. This tastes so much like a sub and everyone really liked it. Served with toasted and torn sub rolls, pita chips and whole wheat Ritz crackers. Thanks!

I used shredded sharp cheddar instead of american. I used green onions (About six, a whole bunch) and I used a whole package of chopped Romanita tomatoes. For the "dressing" to make it more like a hoagie you buy at the sandwich shop, I did half mayo/half sour cream (I was running low on mayonnaise due to the family inhaling the devilled eggs.....) and added in one dry package italian seasoning mix and one batch dry ranch dressing mix and because there was oregano in the dressing mix, I didn't add the extra. I used day old hoagie rolls from the discount rack that I rubbed with garlic and just stuck in the oven to crisp up a bit. We all loved this. LOVED it. With these changes, it was really off the charts insane.

I served this at hubby's poker party. They licked the bowl clean. The only thing I did differently was to use 1/3 Miracle Whip, 1/3 lite mayo, and 1/3 lite sour cream b/c my husband doesn't care for large quantities of mayo. He said it rated four stars.

This was fantastic!  I decided to make this for the grown ups at my son's 3rd birthday party.  Everyone was crazy about it.  It really did taste just like a hoagie (or sub as we Canadians call them).  I took the advice of previous reviewers and added 1 tbsp of red wine vinegar to the mixture.  I also just finely chopped up all the meat with a knife and stacked the cheese to cut that up.  Delicious!

This is a great recipe! Everyone at the party  who tasted it loved it. I took the advice from other reviews and added vinegar to the recipe.  This dip is a nice change from the typical dips & appetizers that appear at every party. I will definately make this again.

Made this for a memorial day weekend away.  I prepared the ingredients ahead of time, so I only had to mix them when the time came.  It was very good.  Everyone raved. I found it to be extremely filling, but tasted great.  Make sure you cut the meat and cheese into very small pieces for easy dipping!

Awesome!  Tastes just like a hoagie.  Hard to stop eating!!!  We ate in a bread bowl.  Would not use so much mayo - fine with less.  Awesome!

Mixed feelings about this dip. I mixed all the ingredients except the mayo and tasted it and loved it! Then I added the mayo and was dissapointed- I just don't think the flavor of mayo goes well with hoagies. Philly hoagies are made with oil and that's what I'm used to and love. I may make this again, but I'll leave out the mayo and top the bread rounds with the mixture before serving, like a bruschetta topping, instead of serving it as a dip.

A real crowd pleaser.  I have to give out several copies of the recipe after a New Years Day open house.  I did cut down on the amount of cheese to 1/2 pound, but it didn't seem to impact the delicious flavor.  A real keeper!

This is an awesome recipe!  I have been making it for years.  Some tips...  If you don't have good hoagie rolls, french baguettes work great, if not better( they are easier to cut into slices and are the perfect size)  Also, if you add about 3 table spoons of olive oil or hoagie oil (whichever you prefer) it breaks up the mayo and makes the dip last longer.

I made this to munch on Thanksgiving Day.  Everyone loved it and it made a nice sandwich spread the next day.  Skip the lettuce and tomatoes mixed in if you want to keep it for the next day.  It won't keep with the tomatoes and lettuce in it.

I have one word, W O W.  This is one good recipe.  My out of town guests for Philly that it was a Hogie, the others thought it was a sub, while others thought it was a grinder.  No matter what you call it, this is a wow.  I have read each of the reviews and took some of the advise, added both red wine vinegar and balsomic and about 1 teaspoon of sugar.  One word of caution, do not judge this until you add the lettuce and tomato, these two put this over the top.  Thank you for this recipe.  I will make it many times.  NJ

This was like no dip I ever made - more like a salad - but it was disappeared right off the table.  None of us had ever had a Hoagie before, but we agreed it was yummy!  With no access to American cheese, I used a combination of grated cheddar (the real stuff, not that yellow gunk) and Parmesan.  Also, for easy mixing and dipping, the lettuce needs to be VERY finely shredded.  And the shreds can't be too long, either, so a bit of choping after shredding is advisable.

Just finished making this and it is awesome! Can't wait to eat it later! I halved the amounts and added garlic, but other than that made exactly as written. Thank you so much for what is sure to be one of our new Favorites!

I've made this before and get nothing but rave reviews.  Some people are hesitant to try it, but they do try it after seeing others gobble it up.  I am getting requests to make this again for this year's Super Bowl, which proves it's something people like and remember.  I usually cut the recipe in half and it is enough for a crowd.

This was very good!! Made as written, but used Pepper Jack cheese in place of American,  and omitted the lettuce, as it was only the two of us, and with making half a recipe, I knew we would not eat it all at one setting, and I was worried about a lot of wilted lettuce.  Thanks for a great Appy!!

Always a winner.  I also like adding either provolone or swiss cheese.  And it's fun to serve in a hollowed out bread bowl.  Then it's good to the last drop!

I made this last night for Halloween, like others I drizzled red wine vinegar over the top and I also added about a tablespoon of sourcream to the mayo. I also halfed it and it still made quite a bit. I got alot of positive feedback from the family!  I will definitely make again, maybe for the Super Bowl! Thanks for the recipe!

I halved this recipe and it still made a ton!  Fed 6 adults, and there was still a lot leftover.  I added 1 T. red wine vinegar.  The dip was incredibly good, did taste exactly like an Italian Hoagie, but was not my favorite dish out that day.  However, all of my guests were freaking out over it!  And, one of my best friends said that I have to bring it to any party she has in the future.

This is awesome, and I'm a Philly girl, and I know my hoagies.  It's really easy to make, and the stuff just disappears when you put it out on the table.  At the deli I ask for shaved ham and just shred that with my fingers.  I also add some red wine vinegar as well.  I don't add the tomatoes and lettuce to the dip, but layer it on top or around the edges.  There's nothing worse than limp lettuce mixed into the dip.

I have been making this dip for years now and have become famous at our football tailgate for it.  The guys love it because it is manly, but the ladies certainly do not shy away either!  I serve with french bread or club rolls cut into rounds so the crowd can scoop it up.  Also, I add a 1/4 lb of shredded pepperoni sometimes to add a little kick and make it like a true italian hoagie.  Yummm....

I'd been wanting to make this since a co-worker brought it in for a Super Bowl Sunday party. I took others' advice and added about a little extra mayo, 1 1/2 t. balsamic and 1 1/2 t. white vinegar to it. I used 1/2lb. ham, 1/4lb. cappicola, 1/4lb. genoa salami, 1/2lb. american, and 1/2lb. provolone. Also mixed the oregano into appr. 2T. olive oil and added it. I also cut up hoagie rolls width-wise to serve with the dip (I was born and raised in Philly, so it's Amoroso rolls only!) Hubby was skeptical, but he loved it. This recipe makes A LOT of hoagie dip, so I took some to work to share. Will make again.

This recipe was a HUGE hit with my family! I took the advice of the reviewer from Philly and added a little extra mayo and a T. of red wine vinegar to give it more of that Philly hoagie taste... I also added a little extra ham and it was delicious! PS- the food processor made this recipe quick and easy!

This does taste just like an Italian hoagie!!  I brought this to a Halloween party, everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe, but I tasted it cold and thought it would taste better heated.  We put it in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes or so, and it tasted better hot.  Would make this again and serve it hot.

I've been searching out an easy recipe for hoagie dip since the first time I had it at a BBQ last summer.  This was really good and easy.  I instead of half pound of salami, I used 1/4 lb salami and 1/4 lb capicola.  Next time, I want to use provalone instead of American cheese.

I've made this several times for work functions and always receive a bunch of requests for the recipe.  I change the meat and cheese types depending on what I have on hand.    Add a dash of olive oil and vinegar for added taste.

I made this for a football pool party and everyone loved it!  I cut the mayo down and added balsamic vinegar, substituted provolone for American, and added oregano.  I don't know about the one reviewer who said it didn't keep well...there was nothing left to keep!

I didn't have any of this, but my husband said it was just okay. I followed the recommendations of others and used some Red Wine Vinegar, but no one at our picinic seemed to rave over this. I will not make this again.

A perfect football party dip for those hungry fans!  Not only was this soooo easy to prepare, it tasted great.  I mixed some balsamic vinegar with the oregano and added a few dashes of olive oil since it didn't already have enough fat in it ?!?!?!  Highly recommended.

I made this for our annual Christmas Party and it was a big hit.  It does taste just like a hoagie.  I also added Balsamic Vinaigrette as others suggested and am glad I did.  Note though this does make a lot.

This was a big hit I received a lot oc compliments.  I just made a few adjustmemts.  (1) I do not like american cheese so instead I used provolone. (2) I used low-fat lite mayo. no one noticed and there were no leftovers. (3) I used a rosemary ham from the deli counter (4) I ran out of onions so the only thing I had on hand was dehydrated onions and still it was a huge success will defintely make again and probably use real onions just to compare.

this is a tasty, quick and easy recipe. i used pre-shredded lettuce and scaled the recipe down to 4 servings (and still had enough for about 8 sandwiches!). i didn't chop everything up into tiny pieces, which made it difficult for "dipping." therefore, we just put the mixture onto split hoagie rolls and ate it like a sandwich -- works perfectly for an easy lunch/dinner.

I made this dip for a picnic this past Memorial Day.  It was a big hit with all of my friends.  Everyone thought it was neat to dip the hoagie buns.  But don't tear the bread too tiny because then it will be hard to get the dip onto the buns.  Overall, the dip was great and really did taste like a hoagie.  The recipe did make a lot so cut the ingredients in half if you are having or going to a small party.

Awesome! Cut recipe in half, added 2oz of pepperoni, subbed provolone for the american cheese, and used red onion. Used mini food processor to chop the meats, cheese, and onion. For the sauce: 1 cup mayo, 1/4 light sour cream, 2T Italian dressing, 1T red wine vinegar, and 1t dried oregano. Served in an Italian bread bowl, topped with lettuce and tomato, and sprinkled top with a little olive oil, red wine vinegar, and oregano. Will make again and again!

This recipe is good, but you have to modify it. I only used 1/4 lb of each meat, 1/4 of an onion and then 1/2 of the mayo/oregano mix.  After I mixed it, I kept it refrigerated in a plastic bowl. I used a bag of shredded lettuce and a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes - I just used as much as I thought it needed. Right before I was ready to leave, I then added the lettuce and tomatoes and the entire mixture fit in a marco polo bread bowl. I also added some diced hot peppers - it was yummy! 

I took it to a party and it was a hit! Since there were so many other food items, the amount that I made was perfect!

I waited so long to try this and was super disappointed. It cost alot of money for all the ingredients, maybe I didnt get the highest quality of lunch meat thats why it didnt taste so good. No one at it. I felt embaressed to have brought it.

This was a really good dip. Looks like this recipe would make a really large quantity so I used just a fraction of each ingredient. Very quick and easy. Im not even a big fan of lunchmeat in general and I really liked this.

Awesome hearty appetizer.  The quantity is huge...sometimes I only make 1/2. I use white american cheese.  Definitely add red wine vinegar - 1 or even 2 tsp.  I've used bagged shredded lettuce & works out well.  Make the bread pieces kind of big or there isn't enough "room" for the dip. The first time I cut the bread too small & it really didn't work out too well. Some of my "guests" even eat this on rolls as a "sandwich".  Someone always wants the recipe when I make it. The only drawback is that it really takes quite a while to cut or tear all of the ham, salami & cheese etc.

Wonderful Dip.  It was the first thing to disappear at our Super Bowl Party.  I added 2 t red wine vinegar, 2 t of Wishbone Italian dressing, 1/2 t garlic powder, 1/4 c mild banana peppers, chopped and 1 t of the juice from the banana peppers.  It was superb.  I had pre-sliced hoagie rolls and included a spreader spoon to make it easier for the guests to enjoy the recipe.  Will DEFINITELY make again.  Thanks

This dip is amazing!! I have made it several times and it is always the hit of the party. Did I mention I am a Philly girl too? So, I know all about good hoagies.  I do add red wine vinegar to this b/c a hoagie is not a hoagie without it.

This recipe rocks!! My husband and kids loved it. Instead of fresh oregano, however, I used a couple of teaspoons of Good Seasons Italian Dressing made with balsamic vinegar and mixed it in with the mayo.  This may appear on my Super Bowl buffet!

This was a hit at our annual Mother's Day family pot luck picnic! Many copied the recipe. This really does tastes like your eating a hoagie! I added a splash of balsomic vinegar, extra mayo and oregano and I used shredded Italian cheese. I served hot pepper hoagie spread on the side. WE all loved it! This will be made again and again!

This did taste hoagie-esque. I think it needed more "bite", perhaps using capicola would liven it up a bit & the idea to use a little red wine vinegar is a good one. I added pickled banana peppers but they weren't acidic enough to cut the heaviness of the mayo. Very creative idea but it's doubtful that I'll make this again. Thanks for letting me try it, though:o)

My husband loves this dip.  I also add vinegar to it either red wine vinegar or balsamic vinegar.  I decided to try it out at a baby shower.  I made a small batch.  The whole bowl was eaten and everyone kept asking if there was more.  I would say it was a big hit.  Was asked for the recipe 4 times that day.  Thanks again for a great recipe!!!!!!

I made this over the weekend to try before I took it to my works party this week, and was very disappointed. Was not wowed at all, neither was my family who also tried it. If I was to make this again I may try to do 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream and see if that helps at all....

This recipe rocks! If you have a lot of boys/men to feed this is definately a starter. My husband and boys ate this up so fast that I had to make another batch before all my guests arrived! Tastes exactly like a hoagie. Thanks!

This is excellent! I made it for a card party,everybody loved it. You need to cut the mayo down to 1 cup though. I also added original submarine dressing and used provolone instead of american cheese. Great recipe! Thanks

I made this dip two ways for a party, one as it was listed with mayo, and another with an oil and vinegar submarine dressing.  Both were a huge hit.  Definitely serve with a spoon, dipping can get messy.

I LOVE this stuff.  I also added a little vinegar to my first batch, and have made it since with italian dressing, or the hoagie dressing they sell in squeeze bottles.  Makes it taste the way i like to eat my sandwiches.  Absolutely delicious, and i will make it again and again.  Pepperoncinis are good in there too.  Thank you!

Just as everyone has said, this tastes just like a hoagie. I also added red wine vinegar to mine. I'm not sure if I would make this again. Only because of the time involved chopping the meat. Unless you want to bring "something different" to a table, just buy a hoagie and slice it into smaller pieces. Same effect, less time.

I've never made the above recipe.  I do have another way I make it though.  We use a 1/4lb of each:  capicola ham, provolone cheese, pepperoni, salomi and bologna.  I also do add the mayo, oregano, onion, pepper and lettuce.  I don't put in tomato since I don't like it.  We cut the lunchmeat up in small peices though, I don't rip it.  If you try these other ingredients, let me know how it was.

Simple recipe, simply delicious!  Took this to a work potluck and received 4 requests for the recipe!  The only changes I made were to substitute low fat sour cream for 1/4 c of the mayo (also low fat) and I used romaine lettuce instead of iceberg.  I took a hint from other reviewers & added 2 T of Paul Newman's Balsamic Vinagrette, too.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

This was a good recipe, but not quite the 5 star recipe I was expecting.  I made it for a rather large party, about 100 people, and brought more than half of it home.  Actually better in a croissant, as a sandwich filler. I will probably not make this one again.

Pretty good.  Better than the usual hoagie tray.  But being born and raised I have NEVER had vinegar on a hoagie.  That's like a "Philly cheesesteak" coming with green peppers.  We don't do that lol.  Love it with some seeded rolls from sarcones!

this dip is delicious!  However, i learned the hard way that you really need to make this the day before to let everything "marinade".  Flavors mix so well - you really do think you are eating a hoagie!

I have been making this recipe for about 3 or 4 years.  I also add a little red wine  vinegar.  I am asked for this recipe whenever I prepare it for any group.  Nothing but raves from  other people on it.  I make sure to use top quality ingredients for top notch taste.  I also cut everything up rather than tearing it.

Not everyone eats their hoagie the same way, so even though I tweaked this recipe I still gave it 5 stars. I had the grocer chip the meat so it was very easy to pull apart instead of slicing. Used Provolne, a little extra onion and red pepper hoagie spread. I put the shredded lettuce on top instead and sprinkled it with a little chopped tomatoe and mild banana pepper slices. I served it on french bread slices. I made only half of the recipe and it was still a lot of dip. My family loved it. It's definitely a keeper .

This was excellent. I too am from the Philly area and it tasted just like a hoagie. I took as other had suggested and added the red wine vinegar. I also, for presentation, hallowed out the inside of a large loaf of bread. Many people at the party said they wanted to just pick up the loaf and eat it. They absolutely loved it and so did I.

I was happy to find this recipe as I've had this at parties over the years and always loved it. I did add the tbsp of red wine vinegar (italian flavored) AND I added a few tsp of red peppers (the refrigerated kind) that you put on a hoagie and it was awesome! Everyone devoured it. It makes a ton....would cut in half next time. Used torn hoagie rolls but you can also use sliced baguette....just couldn't find any yesterday. Baguette actually works great.

Sounds strange, but is the best dip! I made it once and since then it has been requested at every party. I often add capicola, bologna and provalone to the mixture as well. It is great served on bread or crackers. I promise you, it will not be around long once it is served!!

I made a few changes after reading the reviews.  It' a four star the way written.  I used 1 cup of sour cream in place of one cup of mayo since we aren't big on mayo.  I also used shredded cheese instead of the processed since that's what I had on hand.  I layered the lettuce and tomatoes on top and then drizzled 2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar on top and sprinkled some oregano over that.  This was fantastic and it was the first thing gone from the party I took it to.  I was asked numerous times for the recipe.

This was absolutely delicious, and coming from a Philly girl.....that's great! I used half the mayo, and replaced the rest with oil and red wine vinegar. I also added more oregano and left out the lettuce and tomato. I cut the hoagie rolls into rounds and served the dip with a spoon......and it was gone an hour later. THANK YOU!

This was just ok for us. I halved the recipe, but still had to double the sauce ingredients. I took others advice and added a tbsp. or so of red wine vinegar, which gave it a nice tang that we enjoyed. Over all, while the dip was refreshing and fairly tasty my family didn't think that it tasted quite like a hoagie. I may try this again sometime! Thanks for posting. :)

I thought this was a good dip. I added red wine vinegar, extra mayo, and seasoning as it needed a little something extra. I also added sliced pepperoni. I will defintely make again.

Yum! Scaled it down to 4 servings and added a tablespoon of red wine vinegar. I also added a heaping tablespoon of light sour cream to cut down on the mayo flavor a bit. Big hit served with toasted baguette slices.

As per suggestions by other reviewers, I added everything into my food processor & this was so easy to make!  I think the addition of red wine vinegar & a little extra oregano really brings it home.  Had to pass on the recipe to the host of a party I brought this to because everyone loved it!  Thanks for posting!

This is sooooo good! You swear you are biting into a sub sandwich! I do 2 things differently, I use provolone cheese instead of american and put a bowl of red wine vinegar out for guests to spoon over.

Really good. I cut the recipe in half and it still made a lot. I substituted Italian seasoning for the oregano and added a splash of red wine vinegar. I also served the lettuce on the side so that it was not soggy. It does taste just like a hoagie!

YUM! I was asked to bring an appetizer to an Italian dinner party.  I chose this dip and it was a the hit of the evening.  Everyone liked it and I've emailed this recipe to all who attended the party.

I love this, but substitute for the American cheese.  Sargento makes a provolone / mozzarella blend that is preshredded, so it also saves time.  Also, I found the easiest way to chop the meats is to roll them up and use kitchen shears to snip them.  And I cut hoagie buns into 1 inch sections and serve alongside the hollowed out sourdough with the dip in it.

Overall, yum, yum, yum!!!

This was just OK. Not fabulous. I had something similar at a party and hoped this was the recipe, but sadly it was the only appetizer left on the table after the party was over...

My husband loves this dip - he also loves sub sandwiches so it is the perfect dip for him.  I took other reviewers advice and added some hoagie sauce to it.  I also used half provolone and half swiss cheese. Instead of using torn bread, I took a french baguette, sliced it thin and toasted it in the oven with garlic.  We like the little bit of crunch with the dip. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Amazing little dip!  I used provolone cheese, added lebanon baloney, basil, and drizzled about 1 to 2 tablespoons of vinegar, to taste.  The ladies loved it; the hoagie without all the bread.  My boys ate it up before I could serve it at a second party.  It is better if made ahead and  sits in the fridge for a couple of hours.  I served it with sliced italian bread.  Enjoy.

This is such a delicious, creative dip! I made it for a Superbowl party rather than making hoagies because there was a lot of food. It was a hit! I halved the recipe and used provalone along with the american cheese. I reduced the amount of mayo and added a drizzling of olive oil. I also added the red wine vinegar. I can't wait to try it with Italian dressing as someone suggested.

You would swear you were eating a hoagie when you eat this dip! I followed the advice of reviewer Newlywed 2004 and drastically cut down the mayo, added a couple splashes of balsamic vinegar, and used provolone cheese.  This was a hit at a SuperBowl get-together!

I have made this several times with the following variations:  I use 1/4 lb. baked ham & 1/4 lb capacola ham, 1/2 lb. mozzarella & 1/2 lb provolone cheeses (instead of American), 2-3 tbs. oregano & 1 bunch green onions.  I use the shredder attachment of my cuisinart for the meats, cheeses & green onions. I have never had a bad review on this and the majority of people I socialize with are brutally honest (particularly my husband!).

This was indeed very popular with two groups I've made it for.  The second time I prepared it, I added about 1 tablespoon of hots to the dressing mix.  Will try adding the vinagar next time also.

This was good stuff!  Made it for "Friday Treats" at work.  Used a food processor to cut everything fairly fine.  Used packaged shredded lettuce.  Added 1 1/2 T balsamic vinegar. Served it with sliced french bread.  It went over better than the dessert I made.  Makes a LOT.  Thanks!

This is a big hit whenever I make it!  (I cut the amount of mayo in half though, because it was too much for me.  I'll use mayo when called for in recipes, but I don't like too much in/on anything.  Half was just fine for me.)

This is a wonderful recipe, although it is not at all what I expected. I took this to a St. Paddy's Day party and got several requests for the recipe. I added a little red wine vinegar per another reviewer's suggestion and increased the mayo/oreg/vinegar mix by about 50% - I like a slightly wetter dip than you get from the amount of mayo called for in the recipe.  It was excellent - thanks!

This dip is so good, my husband and I sat down and ate the entire bowl until it was gone.  It's an easy recipe, even in large quantites.  I can't explain how much my italian husband loved all the different meats and cheeses mixed with the bread.  I would recommend this to everyone!!!

OH my GOODNESS!!  I made this recipe to take to a party and it made soooo much!  Way more than was needed for our party. Having my in-laws in town for Christmas, all of which are Italians, I made each of them a little appetizer plate for snacking and they devoured it. I asked my FIL if it needed anything extra and he said the recipe is perfect as is.  Super Yummy and if your crew loves hoagie sandwiches, this is a true winner. My photo is 1/3 of the recipe so you can see that it really makes ALOT.

This was ok. I don’t know why I didn’t love it, but I think maybe it was too much meat. I took it to a potluck and there was a lot leftover.

I was intrigued by so many positive reviews that I had to take a chance.  I did follow some advice from others and added Spicy Capicola, Red Wine vinegar,  1/2 Sour Cream (in place of all Mayo), and dash of Sub Sauce.  Served with baguette and the shredded lettuce on the side. Compliments were amazing.  I will make this for two upcoming Holiday parties. Thank You

Guests really enjoyed it and asked for the recipe.  It was very simple to make.  Doesn't take long at all from start to finish.  Will definitely make again.

This is a popular dish in our house! Everyone loves from the kids on up. I use less mayo and sour cream, add some oil and vinegar, oregano - use whatever meat and cheese we have but american and provolone tastes best!

Fabulous dip.  I got this recipe from a friend and after reading the reviews I have made a few changes. Instead of 2 cups of mayo I used 1 cup mayo 1 cup sour cream.  Instead of just oregano I used an Italian Seasoning Blend.  I used my kitchenaid food processor to chop up all ingredients which was so much easier.  I used a loaf of fresh Italian bread and cut it up in the small pieces, then put Balsamic dressing over the bread and toasted until brown.  While I toasted the bread I heated the dip until it was warm. Everyone LOVED it.

I wouldn't use American Cheese..-cubed- provolone or sharp provolone is what I prefer.
I also used cubes of pepperoni, banana peppers. Imagination can go far, but I disagree with American cheese (as much as I love that too) just not on this dip.

This was pretty good, I had a large amount of salami and didn't know what to do with it all, I found this recipe and thought I would give it a shot, I'm glad I did! I followed the advice from others and added some balsamic vinegar and I added a couple tsp of olive oil. It tasted just like a hoagie!

Everyone loves when I make Italian Sub Dip!  I changed the recipe slightly because - I wanted it to refelct a more traditional italian sub.  I use provolone cheese not american and I also add oil and vinegar (use mayo too but less mayo than called for).  Try it you can taste the difference.

Like the other reviewers we omitted the lettuce and tomato and added red wine vinegar.  We didn't really like it, so we baked it for a little while.  It turned out good.

so simple and so tasty. I'm from philly so this is really an authentic taste. I personally don't like salami in any form so I substituted turkey for it and provolone for the american and my entire office loved it. added a little more oregano too (maybe b/c mine is older and not as potent. they ate the entire recipe in a morning and this makes A LOT! very easy.

I love this recipe. I have many vegetarians in the family so I left out the meat products and used instead 1/2 cup American cheese, 1/2 cup provalone cheese, and 1/2 cup swiss cheese. It went faster than the "regular" hoagie dip.

Took this to a Halloween party and - once people got over how different it looked - everyone seemed to really enjoy it. Not the easiest thing to eat using torn bread...I would prefer Frito Scoops or something similar. Followed others' input and bought some hoagie "dressing" to squirt into it for authentic hoagie taste. So simple and quick!

Made this for a big family picnic.  Everyone absolutely loved it.  I used less mayo than what was called for.  Takes a little time to chop the meats and cheese, but well worth the effort.

All my co-workers request this every time we have a food day at work.  Inevitably someone always asks me for the recipe, this is beyond excellent!  I sometimes throw in a little bit of vinegar for a little kick, but not too much or it will get runny.

This was great!  I made it for a 4th of July party and everyone loved it.  The only thing is it doesn't keep well.  I had it indoors with the air conditioning on and it still only lasted for about an hour before it started going south.  A quick, easy, and cheap appetizer.  Thanks Joe!

I really wanted to try this recipe and should have known better than to take it to a shower without trying it first.  It had WAY too much mayonaise.  Think it could have been easily cut in half.  I think it would have been better if the meat would have been cubed and not sliced thin.  Used as a chunky spread on bread maybe.  Sorry, I didn't like it and most of the shower guests didn't either.  Alot of plates had this left on it when they went into the garbage.

This dip was GONE before it even reached the table!!! Even my 3 yr old ate it for lunch--then licked the plate, honestly!  It was soooo good.  I am going back today to get the makings to make it again.  Everyone wanted the recipe!  You must try it for yourself!

This was huge at our superbowl party. Everyone liked it! It tastes just like a hoagie and is a lot cheaper to make than buying hoagies for 12 people. Thanx!

This was an awesome dip! I just LOVED it. It was so much nicer to serve this at a recent party--instead of the usual sandwhich platters from the deli.  I followed the recipe pretty close and it was great. I would recommend cutting the recipe in HALF if you dont have a BIG crowd to serve it to--it does NOT keep as leftovers at all.

This recipe is great but it took a lot longer to make then 30 minutes. It was a huge hit though.
