I'm giving this a 5 star review because the combination of cinnamon and Sriracha is magical and you should make it and see for yourself.  No go.  Make this.   Beyond that, I only took the recipe as a suggestion as I had last minute notice that  friend was to coming over the next night and I scrambled to throw something together to be ready for a dinner after work and after we went for a walk.   I used raw chicken breasts, cans of jalapeno diced tomatoes, a can of diced green chilis, a jug of chicken broth and threw everything together in a crock pot and cooked on high for three hours (to include raw diced carrots).  Once the chicken was cooked, I used "bear claws" to shred the chicken and add back to the pot and refrigerate over night.  Since my carrot supply was woeful, right before our walk I diced up some zucchini and threw that in the pot and let everything reheat as we walked for an hour or so.  Upon our return, I found my on the fly adaptations not enough on the soupy side of the house so cooked up a batch of rice  so we had something a bit more filling to serve this over and make a "complete" meal, while we sipped wine.  Everything was fantastic and I will make this again.  Don't let my severe adaptations sway you (or take encouragement and wing it yourself, you'll be fine) as the star of this recipe is the flavor combination of the cinnamon and Sriracha (I use the brand "The Fix), it is an amazing combo and lends itself to adaptation and frequent consumption.

I really enjoyed the sweet roasted carrots with the cinnamon flavor and how it was balanced by the spicy sriracha.  Only change I made was to roast the tomatoes, onions, garlic, and jalapeno all together at 425 (500 degrees always set off my smoke detectors).
