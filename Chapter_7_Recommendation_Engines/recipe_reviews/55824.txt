EXCELLENT!!!  I do this on a much smaller scale (2 bunches of just turnip greens) for our smaller family of 5.  All my 3 toddlers just love it too!  Sometimes, I use some pepperoncini juice for some extra zing.

I made this recipe twice over the holidays--once with bacon and once with some leftover Christmas ham instead. Both were a success! My Southern husband and in-laws loved it. Many thanks from a formerly clueless Yankee!

It really annoys me when reviewers change the recipe and then give it a bad review! I've never been a big greens fan, but I made this for a big family gathering, and everyone loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and it was great.  I've added my own touches here and there, as does every other cook I know. You have to add your own personal touch.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I used frozen greens and replaced the water with chicken broth. (not as much liquid was needed since not wilting the greens down) It even received rave reviews from those who normally dislike greens.

These greens needed a lot of doctoring! It just didn't have that Southern down home taste I've been accustomed to. I've enjoyed greens during every major holiday while growing up, and finally wanted to make some of my own.  (This was actually my 3rd time making them).  In order to get them to taste like anything, I ended up adding 3 chicken bouillon cubes, more pickle juice, jalepeno juice, a little bit of seasoning salt, garlic powder, & crushed red pepper. After adding this I was finally able to lick my platter clean :-)

Ok all you other southern residents can stop reading this post.  I made these and they were very good.  I have been trimming back on my ham hocks and bacon after watching the last southern generation battle heart disease.  I even used .......turkey bacon and frozen turnip greens.  I was expecting lighting or something to strike me when I put in the pan.  I did have to add a extra spicy for my taste.  I put in some no salt ham flavor....to make up for the turkey and some pepper flakes.....I left out the butter as I didn't need to boil.  30 mins I was finished great vege for a busy night in the new south.

This is an excellent combination of greens the only thing I do different in omit the pickle juice from the cooking and use vegetable oil and salt pork or ham hocks instead of the bacon... diced onions as well instead of the slices... Being from the south means greens are a staple in our households... and if you have turnips of any kind you MUST use the roots... oh how delicious.. and the cooking time is the key the greens should NOT be crunchy we are not having salad we are having greens so they are cooked down until they are tender... served up with a side of warm cornbread and H_O_N_E_Y....umph...

I substituted chard and collards for the turnip greens, put in chicken broth instead of water and added about a tablespoon of creole seasoning.  Fabulous!

These were very good, but they needed a little more oomph to suit our taste. Next time I will add some hotsauce and vinegar. Thanks LUCKYCHEEKS!

My family loved this recipe and it was so easy! I used 1 bag of pre-washed turnip greens and left everything else the same. This cooking time was pefect...tender and flavorful!

I was never a fan of turnip greens.  Every time I tried them anywhere I'd go I didn't like them and then I found this recipe and the high ratings and thought I'd give it a try.  I'm glad I did.  It is delicious!  My husband even loves it and he was never a fan either.  I did make a few changes.  I used all turnip greens, 3 tbsp of butter and about 3/4c of pickle juice.  Amazing!

Delicious!  I was nervous about the bacon being chewy, as I prefer crisp bacon, but because it cooks for so long the bacon is incredibly soft.  Absolutely wonderful.  My whole family loved it even my 11 month old!

This was my first time making greens. I only used 1 bag of pre-washed turnips and I didn't add the mustards. I think I added too much water so I hate to add a bit more pickle juice and they still turned out excellent. Tangy and delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

I added season salt, hot paprika, 2 cloves of garlic, garlic powder, onion powder, sriracha, and substituted white vinegar for the pickle juice.  BEST GREENS EVER.

I don't even like turnip greens but this was delicious with just a few minor changes to my liking not important enough to mention.  My husband said that this is the very best greens that he has ever had and he is a Southern through and through!!  Thank you for this great recipe!!

I only used turnip green since that is what I had in my garden. I made a few adjustments and added 2 Tbsp. of sugar to the pot because turnip greens are bitter depending if they are young or not(my were not). I also took the advice of another and added moe pickle juice 1 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder, 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper and 2 tsp. of seasoned salt. Very tasty recipe I will make this for the holidays!!

This was a very good way to cook the greens.  The only thing I changed is that I destemed the greens before cooking them and I don't eat pork so I left that out.  But very good. Thank you for the add.

This was my first time cooking southern greens, and I used 6 bunches fresh collards with all the same seasonings, except I used jalapeño juice instead of pickle juice. Excellent!!

Really enjoyed this!! I used just mustard greens fresh from my vegetable garden and it was delicious! I did add some garlic powder as well - think it was a nice compliment to the dill pickle juice.

DH grew greens and I had never cooked them.  He loved this so much he said he might just keep me around!  After eleven years I'm not worried but I think I 'll keep making this exactly as the recipe says!

Skipped the onion (just forgot it), and used pancetta cubes for the meat flavor, 'cuz it's what needed to be used in my fridge. Greens came out really good, and didn't last long enough to be leftovers.

I'm still not a great fan of mustard/turnip greens but I was able to eat all of my serving. Scaled down to 3 servings for 1 bunch of each.

This is yummy! Since our family loves greens, I have used this recipe with frozen turnip greens and fresh collard greens. And not just for holidays, either ;)
