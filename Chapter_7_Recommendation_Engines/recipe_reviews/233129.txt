What I liked about this recipe is that the burgers stayed nice and moist even when using lean 96/4 ground beef. We usually cook our burgers to about a medium doneness but I knew with the addition of the onions they would need more time to cook. Even well done they were very juicy. I did find that the meat needed some salt so I will add that next time to enhance the flavors. These would probably be really good if you mixed the meat early in the day in order for the flavors to blend.

Delicious.. The most moist burgers I have ever tasted. The Sour Cream is the "secret" trick. I added some real bacon bits and some Epicure Selections spices and used real garlic. Mmm Mmm good. I will be using this recipe from now on to make my barbeque burgers. Did I say Del-i-cious!

Delicious. I was very casual with amounts - used some soft bread crumbs and some panko. Cayenne pepper added not-overwhelming heat. Discerning grandson said my burgers get better and better after eating these. Moist and kept their shape well although I would use less sour cream next time ( I used more than the recipe called for).
