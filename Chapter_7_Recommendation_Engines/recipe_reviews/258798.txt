Very good pancakes that the whole family enjoyed. As written, these are good. Buckwheat, banana, coconut milk, and blueberries are a genius combination of flavors. It's as though you were eating a smoothie in a pancake. I added a bit of baking powder after the first three pancakes didn't rise at all. I also added a bit more flour because the batter was very thin. Perhaps having used homemade coconut milk may have affected the consistency. Thank you for the recipe.

This was pretty decent. Especially for a gluten-free recipe. These are some of the things Iâ€™ve changed, I used almond milk instead of soy milk and only 3/4 of a cup, I added half a banana to the batter and blended it thoroughly. Added slightly more buckwheat, and did not add the tablespoon of honey (I recommend adding it). Lastly used coconut oil instead of butter. All in all it was yummy! ??
