I have never made punch before & was having a party on 2/13. With all the great reviews I figured I had to try it.  I used 2 cans Welch's White Grape Juice & 1 can Passion Fruit Juice (instead of fruit punch). I used the lemon-lime soda and raspberry sherbert but I skipped the lemons and ice. No only was it great, everyone loved it and several people asked for the recipe. I would definately make it again.

I used this at an outdoor wedding, and both adults and kids went crazy for this punch.  Follow the recipe's suggestion of making the punch in small batches, because people really preferred the punch while it was  very fizzy.  The fizz lasts maybe 5 minutes, and after that the taste does not change, but the presentation does.  To make the small batches, I mixed the thawed juice concentrates together and then divided them into small Ziplock bags.  I also used a melon ball scoop to make small balls of raspberry sorbet, which I also put into small Ziplock bags.  Lastly, I divided up the ice cubes into small bags.  Doing so made the punch-making process quick, easy, and clean, as I only had to open up one bag of concentrate, sorbet, and ice cubes per punch bowl and then pour soda on top.  Even if you don't follow all of my suggestions, I highly recommend that you at least divide up the juice concentrate as it will stain, and you don't want that problem!!       By the way, these servings are small and are made to fit small punch glasses.  Expect to use three or four of these servings per adult.

I hosted a bridal shower last weekend and quickly needed a great punch recipe.  I got lucky when I found this one!  I used the WHITE grape juice and PASSION fruit punch and the color was a nice pink.  I couldn't fill the punch bowl quickly enough.....and I didn't even have time to use the lemons.
Thank you Denyse! ;)

This is a great punch. I used white grape juice and when I began mixing it I realized that I had grabbed a white grape juice with cranberry by mistake. It didn't matter. It was still great! Because we were in a time crunch we didn't freeze the lemons, we just sliced them and floated them on top. It was pretty and tasty. Thank you! This is my punch recipe from now on!!!

Based on the high ratings, I picked this for a baby shower and it was wonderful.  It was a small shower, so I cut the recipe in half and based on other suggestions, put sliced lemons in the glasses instead of taking the ice cube route.  It was great, easy and very popular with the guests.  I will definitely use this recipe in the future!

Thanks Denyse, you completly saved me I had to cater for 150 people and need the perfect drink. I made it without even trying it before hand, and it turned out great. Thanks to the others to rated it high, I can always count on the readers to lead me to the right recipe!

Great tasting punch! It does only make 192 5 or 6 oz servings.  It's good recipe to double for all to have more than 1 serving. Delicious! Thanks

I made this punch on a small scale for a tea party.  I mainly made it just for fun but it turned out to be the hit of the party!  Everyone loved it and five women were able to put a huge dent in the punch bowl!  I'll be sure to make this again!

I served this punch at a baptism luncheon and adults and children loved it.  I scaled the recipe to make 100 servings and 30 people managed to make it dissappear.  Very easy to make and fairly inexpensive.

My aunt made this for my bridal shower, and it was outstanding! It was gone by the time half the party was over. We used a regular ice ring instead of the ice cubes because of the number of people there. We would definitely make this again!

I've made this twice, once according to the directions and once without the grape juice. It was a hit both times, but best with the extra juice. At the suggestion of my sis-in-law I used regular food coloring to get a nice orange for a fall baby shower.

I made this for a Christmas party yesterday. It was very yummy, but I had to change a few things. I started off with half of the concentrate and half of the soda but all I could taste was the soda. When I added the other half of the concentrate it tasted good. So, I ended up using half of the amount of soda. I made the ice cubes with lemon wedges, but the ice melted right away and then I just had little pieces of lemon floating in the punch. It would have looked better and been less trouble if I had sliced the lemon in circles and just put them on top.

BEST PUNCH EVER!  Used this punch at a baby shower and I highly recommend using RAINBOW sherbert.  It adds really neat coloring, and tastes really good too!

I made this for a home party I had and everyone LOVED it! I used the white grape juice and passion fruit and I didn't put the lemons/limes in ice cubes, i just cut them into circles and let them float. I then made it for a baby shower and again it got rave reviews. This is awesome for parties!

Awesome!! Very nice flavor and something different than the traditional punch. Be sure to add ginger ale at the very end. Sugar free ginger ale works great

I've had much better punch before. Wasn't too fizzy and was too sweet.

This was a FANTASTIC recipe for party punch. I made it for our family Christmas Eve party and everyone really enjoyed it. I received many compliments and many recipe requests too. I didn't have sorbet and instead used black raspberry ice cream. It came out nice and creamy. Thank you so much Denyse!!! This is a real keeper!!!

DELICIOUS.  I HOSTED A BRIDAL SHOWER AND DECORATED A SMALL TABLE TO DISPLAY THE PUNCH.  IT LOOKED WONDERFULL.  I HAD TO REFILL THE BOWL THREE TIMES.  EVERYBODY COMPLIMENTED ME ON THIS PUNCH.

very classy.  I used white grape juice (does it matter?) and it turned out very well.  I would recommend pouring the soda over the sherbert though for a more "even" foam.

This was extremely popular with everyone and beautiful to look at- it will definitely make an appearance again and again in my house.  The lemon wedge ice cubes actually gave off just a tinge of lemon taste- very cute and good!  I did substitute apple juice for the fruit punch, as the author suggested some experimentation and I am not a lover of fruit punch mix; I also tried putting more juice concentrate in per volume than the recipe called for because I really enjoy sweet drinks.  Please be aware this makes a huge amount so pare it down unless you are having a large gathering.

Very tasty punch. The sorbet was an interesting ingredient for me. It left a funny skim on top that most of my guest did not care for. Loved the taste though.
