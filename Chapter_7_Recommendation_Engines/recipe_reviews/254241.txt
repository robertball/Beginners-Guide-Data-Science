No Sumac, no pine nuts and substituted red onion for green onion, dried herbs substituted for fresh ones and still tasted amazing

Made as written except that I did not use the pine nuts out of personal preference. This is excellent! Even though I loved the amount of dill in it I think it might be a little bit too much for most. Use your own judgement  there. This paired very nicely with the lamb chops I made but would work great with many different things. Definitely a keeper!
