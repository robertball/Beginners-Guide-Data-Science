This burger has excellent taste! I love the thyme in it. I followed the recipe as is, but just added a little garlic powder and topped them off with some pepper jack cheese. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because of the texture. They were a little tough to grill because they wanted to fall apart and the texture when eating them is a little different too. But that is to be expected when using egg and bread crumbs! GREAT taste though! Thank you!

had a good taste, but the burgers did not hold up well on the grill.  I will try it again because they were so tasty, but we had one full "casualty" that completely fell apart.  I also tweaked the bbq sauce to be 1/2 ketchup 1/2 taco sauce to give it more of a kick :) also added a bit of minced onion to the beef mix because we're fans of it in burgers.

I thought these were pretty good... the barbeque sauce definitely just tasted like ketchup but that really wasn't very unexpected. I used crackers instead of the bread crumbs. For me the recipe wasn't anything spectacular but they weren't bad...

This was FABULOUS!  Hubby loved it.  My changes: added balsamic vinegar to the BBQ sauce and at the end topped with pepper Jack cheese slices until they melted.  Delightful!  We didn't even put them on buns with anything else, just ate them with forks.

My family & friends just loved this recipe. I liked that the hamburgers did not fall apart while grilling and had a great consistency to them.

WHAT A NICE CHANGE FROM THE REGULAR HAMBURGER!  This is a great recipe, more like a grilled meatloaf than hamburger, the sauce was great, and I served it with smokey cheddar cheese, and bacon on top, even my three yr old loved it!  A KEEPER FOR SURE!

The burger was delicious but there was a bit too much thyme in my opinion. Unless you really like thyme, I'd suggest adding about 1/8 teaspoon.

These were so moist and delicious! The spices were a little much for me and I might cut back next time on that, but overall, these were awesome burgers!

This turned out very flavorful and moist. I will add it to my recipe book under the title, "Meatloaf Burgers."
I didn't have any tyme. Other than that followed the recipe exactly, toasted a french bun for it and added a couple dabs of the sauce on the cooked burger.
I tried to flip the burger a few times to keep basting while cooking and this wasn't a good idea. The patties crumbled a little bit because of this. Next time I may flip just once and cook covered to reduce cook time as well. I also added a minced fresh jalapino to give it a little extra kick.
Great recipe. Thanks!

These burgers didn't taste all that great.  They also fell apart easily while grilling.  Everyone said they much prefer just a plain hamburger to these.  I won't make these again.

These burgers are extremely moist!  We didn't make the BBQ sauce...Instead we had mushroom swiss burgers.  Good burgers directly off of the grill...but even better when reheat later.

This is a great burger, but the texture is not traditional.  It is more like a meatloaf texture and we all enjoyed the tastes. Great to eat without a bun.  The is especially great if you like meatloaf sandwiches,but you don't have to wait for the leftovers.

I didn't make the BBQ sauce, but the burgers were excellent with typical toppings! They were juicy, had great flavor and stayed together very well on the grill.
