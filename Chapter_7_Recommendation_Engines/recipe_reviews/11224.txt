DELICIOUS !!! I didn't use the dates or walnuts and instead used 2 cups of apple. VERY moist. Yummy with a light sour cream icing.

Moist and good keepers(if you hide them!). Substituted raisins for the dates. For a quick way to dress them up, if you don't have time to make frosting, simply shake cinnamon sugar over the cookies before putting them in the oven. Can't keep these around!

Yummmmm!!!!  Perfect to make when you have lots of apples from your apple tree....I subbed an additional cup of apples instead of the dates and frosted with cream cheese frosting.

People really seemed to like these, I wasn't a huge fan.  They were kind of cakelike and moist.  But they tasted good.  Maybe I'll have to try them again.

I made this in bar form and instead of using dates & raisins I used dried cranberries and white chocolate chips.  The consistency is more like a cake than a cookie.  They were very moist.  I think if I made it again I'd use real butter instead of shortening and maybe more spices.

I put 2 cups of apples in cause we had a whole bunch to use up that we picked about two weeks ago. I also added about a cup of chocolate chips and skipped the nuts and dates all together. I put it in the conventional oven and its taking longer than 10 minutes to bake, I think it's just my oven thats the problem, but they sure smell good!

great caky cookie.  I did the drop cookies and you really only need 1/2t to make each one.  I didn't have nutmeg so I adjusted the cinnamon to 1 1/2 t. The 1st batch was too big and ran together a bit.  I also skip the icing they're great the way they are

These were absolutely delicious! The apple and dates combo worked very well. I doubled the spices because we like 'em really spicy, halved the brown sugar and added 1/3c honey and they were plenty sweet, moist and flavorful. These just may be my new favorite cookie.

I took out the shortening and used a butter substitute instead. I also exchanged dried blueberries and Craisins for the dates. When they had just come out of the oven my husband didn't think he'd like them, so I make a buttercream almond frosting. I stuck them all in the fridge to get the frosting hardened up. They are DELICIOUS!!!

These were very yummy and a good way to use our fresh picked apples.  I made them in bar form.  The only issue I had was the bars came out VERY thin in my 13x18" half sheet pan.  I did not use any dates or walnuts, but did add about 2 cups of apples instead.  I also was out of ground cloves which I think would have added another layer of taste to these bars.  I frosted them with a homemade caramel cream cheese frosting and the kids ate them up.  Will definitely make them again.

Good texture, moist, lots of flavour surprises with nuts & fruit. Cookies could've been sweeter. Good reason to use the optional glaze to help in that regard. I mixed a good shake of cinnamon into icing sugar glaze. Not that I'm THAT into cinnamon but was considering  next time to try tossing apples with cinnamon so it adheres instead of infusing; hence, more cinnamon flavour.

I added an extra cup of apple, did away with the nuts and dates, and substituted the spices for two teaspoons of allspice. It turned out really nicely! Really soft, really good.

I do like these.  Make sure not to use too much apple or they will be very moist and will fall apart.

This recipe was okay, but I wouldn't make it again.  I did it in bar form, and the consistency was more like cake than cookies.  The taste was fine, but nothing special.
