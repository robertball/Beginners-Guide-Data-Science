It was a easy dish to make, if you have a food processor. I had to research kumquats not being familiar with the fruit. At first I thought that they had to be peeled because the recipe didn't specify. I read on this website that the only need to have the seed removed, the entire rest of the fruit should be put into the dish peel and all. I was hoping this dish would be jellied, but it wasn't.
