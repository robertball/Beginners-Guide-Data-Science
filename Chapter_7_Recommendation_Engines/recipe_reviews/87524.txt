I did not add additional salt when I sauteed the meat because canned soups tend to be a bit salty on their own. I used 8 oz. fresh chopped baby bella mushrooms instead of canned, the full can of beef broth (just to make more "gravy") and fresh ground pepper to taste. I served this over buttered egg noodles. I did not try this myself but my family thought it was great. NO leftovers. This was very simple and came together in 20 minutes, from start to finish.

Everyone enjoyed this. I did change things a little...I sauted the onion in a little butter and olive oil until tender, and then added the mushrooms (I used fresh - 1/2 sliced white button and 1/2 sliced baby bellas) and sauted those until all moisture was gone and then added the minced garlic and sauted for 2 minutes. I then deglazed with the white wine and allowed to simmer until the pan was almost dry. This mixture was removed from the pan and set aside and the ground beef was added to the pan and browned. Then the mushroom mixture added back in.  I mixed the flour with 1/2 cup of beef stock and added that to the skillet and then 2 cans of mushroom soup and 1.5 the amount of beef broth (I used stock) called for in the recipe and a splash of Worcestershire. (Also seasoned with Salt and Pepper along the way). Allowed this to simmer for approx. 10 - 15 min and served over wide egg noddles. Very tasty weenight dinner.

Very simple yet very tasty!  My family raved.  We didn't have wine so I used water.  Next time I'd cut back some on the onions and I LOVE onions.

Lovely recipe - the white wine addition really makes this dish.  Even though ground beef is used it really tastes much more elegant.  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned just because I had them.  Delicious.

Really good!  Increased the broth to a full can & increased the worchestershire sauce to 2 tbsps for a richer taste.

I was just looking for something quick and easy to do with ground beef, and instead I've found my husband's new favorite meal.  The only thing I changed was instead of white wine I used Marsala cooking wine.  I didn't have any onions, so I used dried minced onions.  I served it over fettucini noodles, but I think it would be better with egg noodles, or even macaroni.  It was awesome!

I used 1lb ground turkey (that's what I had).  I used fat free cream of mushroom soup and corn starch (what I had) and an entire can of beef broth.  I didn't have worchestershire, so I used soy sauce.  I still felt that it was bland, so I added some garlic powder, more black pepper and a small splash of mustard.  All in all it was very good.  The most picky eater (my husband) had two bowls and said he would eat it 'occasionally'.  The college student, kindergartner, toddler, and I all enjoyed it.  I will keep it and make it again!  Thanks!

This was a very good tasty way to utilize ground beef and ingredients that usually are available in the cupboard. Instead of using canned mushrooms, I used fresh mushrooms that I sauteed prior to adding them to the browned meat mixture.  To reduce the fat content, I drained the browned meat mixture, used reduced fat soup and substituted the butter for olive oil.  I would recommend this recipe for anyone who is looking to make a quick meal with ground beef.

This recipe is definitely a "do-over," although I found we needed to add extra salt at the table.  You might want to increase salt to 1/2 teaspoon.  Also, I drained the fat off of the meat even though the recipe didn't indicate to do so.

This was very tasty!  I used what I had on hand, so used french onion soup (canned) instead of beef broth, fresh mushrooms, and steak cut into strips instead of ground beef.  Didn't have any Worcestershire sauce either, so added a dash of A1.  The pans are empty (barely enough for my lunch for tomorrow!), so looks like it's a keeper at my house!

This was very quick and easy recipe.  The only thing I did different was didn't have any white wine.  So I used beef broth instead.  Worked great that way.

I love beef stroganoff but my husband can't have dairy so this was a great recipe for us! I didn't think it was possible to make beef stroganoff without sour cream but this was great. I have made it several times now.

Used this recipe because I didn't have sour cream on hand. I skipped the salt and used 10.5oz of beef broth. I also was a little liberal with the Worcester sauce. Loved it!

It turned out great!! I was looking for a quick recipe to whip up before I head to work and this was perfect. Its quick, easy and tastes great. In lieu of chopped mushrooms, I used chopped eggplant and in lieu of worcestershire sauce, I just seasoned the meat while frying it with all purpose seasonings. It provided enough flavor and paired well with the cream of mushroom and wine.

Very nice without the sour cream.  We used Sirloin steak instead of the ground meat. Cooking time was extended to insure meat tenderness. The mushroom soup and wine added a really good flavor to the dish.  I would recommend to anyone interested in a quick, simple, meal.  We served with broccoli, side garden salad, and hot crescent rolls. 2010-03-05.

I made this last night and had to make some changes due to what I had on hand. Used Marsala wine instead of white (not gonna lie, I had white but I was drinking it lol) won't do that again, I am not a big fan of marsala wine but it turned out ok, I just think it would have been better with the white.  I didn't have an onion so I threw in some dehydrated onion, this worked out fine. I ended up using penne pasta instead of the egg noodles and that was fine too. I did use more garlic then called for just because I love garlic. Last I didn't mix the flour with the liquids, I sprinkled it over the meat after browning and cooked it a little more then added all the liquids this way there were no lumps and it thickened up very nice. Overall it turned out pretty good and will definitely make again only for sure using the white wine. This is a quick and easy recipe to make and taste pretty good.

Very good sauce and quite tasty.  I had some pork cutlets that I cubed in lieu of ground beef.  I also added 1/2 t. of Tarragon to enhance the sauce.  We both thought is delicious and are looking forward to eating the leftovers.

I wanted to try this because I can't have sour cream but love beef stroganoff. I don't keep white wine on hand so I used half a cup of beef broth instead. I also used a whole can of beef broth to add in instead of the half can called for, and garlic salt rather than garlic cloves. Once everything was cooked and mixed together I wasn't so sure about it. It looked too much like hamburger helper, and while I have nothing against HH, if I'm cooking it's because I want something other than HH for once :P It also lacked in colour so I added a big handful of dried parsley flakes. However, it did taste better than expected, mostly due to the Worcestershire sauce. I added in a very liberal "dash", stirred it in and let it cook for a few minutes, then added in an equally liberal second dash. It was decent, I will at least eat the leftovers. However, if I make it again I'll probably use beef strips and fresh mushrooms, and maybe experiment with a few additional seasonings.

The flavor was ok but way too much flour that made it gooey and the meat was too tough.

I used fresh mushrooms (they're always better) and chicken broth (because that's what I had). Came out delicious!

Wonderful, quick, simple and tasty recipe! It also works with ground pork and chicken broth when you want a break from red meat.

Loved it!  Very filling!  Delicious over a bed of steamed cabbage and egg noodles.  I used leaks instead of onions for a more mild taste.  Made it for my family twice in two weeks.  They even liked the left overs :) Thanks!

This was very good, and easy, despite my picky boyfriend not wanting ground beef. I subbed top round, thinly sliced. I ditched the salt, because I used white cooking wine which is very salty. I did shop specifically for this recipe, so I found myself wanting (and lacking) a little bit more beef stock while it was thickening. I used water, and it seemed okay. Thanks for sharing!

The ground beef created a dish just like Hamburger Helper, which is not a favorite of mine. It also was visually unappealing.  If I try again, I will use sirloin strips.

Hey, I am trying to cook light so the "No sour cream" attracted me to this recipe.  To make this even lighter I replaced ground beef with lean ground turkey; used plain yogurt instead of butter; wheat flour instead of white flour and mixed regular egg noodles with whole wheat egg noodles.  It still tasted great! Enjoy cooking light :)

I thought this was good, not great.  I did use low-fat, lower salt cream of mushroom soup.  I used 2 lbs. of ground beef, two cans of the soup, a whole 10 oz can of beef broth and 3/4 cup of white wine.  I thought it needed some more spice, so I put about a 1 teas of dried thyme in it.  However, my husband loved it, so I will make it again.  I think I will try red wine next time, perhaps that will go even better with the beef.

I used 2 lbs of ground beef which I browned and strained first.  Then cooked about 14 oz of fresh mushrooms & the chopped onion in butter.
Reduced the flour to 3 T.  Used proportionally more of the other ingredients due to the 2 lbs of ground beef.  Other reviews found it too "white" but cooking the mushrooms generated a nice color for the dish.

Nice recipe and will definitely make it again. I changed a couple things.... I didn't use wine (super expensive where I live), I used beef strips Instead of ground beef, and a cream of mushroom instant packet (which I mixed with water) instead of cream of mushroom soup.  Next time I would also use fresh mushrooms, not canned.

Let me start off by saying, we just moved and I am very limited on what I have to work with in the kitchen right now, so I had to make changes and improvise. But, this recipe deserves 5 stars because it was the base of our amazing dinner, perfect for those days when you have to work magic to put a meal together.  
These are the changes I had to make. I had to skip the onion and garlic, I don't have any yet, not even powder. I didn't have white wine or beef broth, so I used chicken broth for both. And lastly, I don't have Worcestershire sauce yet, but I have steak sauce, so I used a splash of that. I served it with buttered egg noodles, and it was awesome. Everyone gobbled it up and asked me to make it again. I do want to try the recipe the way it's written too though. But, if you're in a bind, like me, this recipe is perfect because it allows adjustments with whatever you have on hand.

so glad I found a decent beef stroganoff recipe with no sour cream. I sauteed onions and garlic in butter/olive oil as another reviewer suggested. next i added 1/2 cup white wine and let it reduce. then I added beef, chicken broth (not crazy about beef broth) cream of mushroom soup, salt, pepper and wostechire sauce. let simmer for 10-15 minutes and adjusted seasoning with a touch more salt, pepper and sauce. i found i didn't need flour to thicken. Very tasty!!

I have looked for a recipe for beef stroganoff that my family would like for years.  I made this one last night and everyone was going back for more!!!  Definitely one I will make again and again!  I did not have white wine so I used water instead and it was still great.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

This was pretty good.  I never use canned mushrooms tho.  I have also made it with small meatballs using worchestershire and beef stock to soak the fresh bread for crumbs.  It has always been a fav. of my son.

This was good if you are a hamburger helper fan. I enjoyed it but didn't think it was the best. I would have given 3 stars but my husband loved it and is still eating leftovers the 3rd day! Lol 

I omitted the mushrooms because we are not a fan. I used slightly more than half a can of beeth broth. I found the the taste of the beef broth overwhelming so I ended up diluting with about 1/4 cup water. This made for the perfect creaminess. Adding the Worcestershire at the end is a must!

You could taste the wine in it which I didn't really think you would be able to. I don't think I will make this one again.

This was exciting because it used up a can of cream of mushroom soup left over from the green bean casserole holiday tradition. We used fresh mushrooms and beef bullion cubes as mild substitutions.....pretty tasty.

Great recipe! Some things I didn't have like, the can of mushrooms, wine, Worcestershire sauce or garlic. I used 3 Tbsp of flour and added skim milk to thin the mixture a bit since I wasn't putting in wine. I used garlic seasoning in place of the garlic clove. Delicious!!! I poured the gravy over cooked rotini noodles! YUM!!!!

Was it just me or did this come out creamy white and not like the picture at all!?  I think the picture must be wrong.  Overall, a pretty good recipe considering I didn't have any sour cream.  It could use a little more taste. Mine seemed a little bland so I added extra garlic, pepper and worcestshire sauce. Not bad. A good recipe to have on hand.

It tasted like hamburger helper--that's fine at least I know what's in it!  But it was so visually unappetizing that I could not finish eating it.  Really pale, white and grayish.  I don't know how the above photo looks so good--maybe they left out the flour?

Made this recipe using our leftover meatballs instead of the ground beef.  Will use this recipe again.  Next time I'll be more careful when I add the wine/flour mixture...mine went lumpy..oops! (-:  Thanks for the no sour cream stroganoff!  (we almost never have sour cream in the house)

This was okay. I tried it bc I wanted to do something with ground beef other than lasagna or spaghetti or meatloaf. But I didn't have sour cream, thus I used this recipe. I used ziti pasta. I'd make this again, but its nothing to write home about.

No complaints on the recipe, I've always liked stroganoff but I hate sour cream so I was more than excited to find this recipe. I usually make it with whatever wine I feel like throwing in there, red, marsala, or white, and it's good with all three. I omit the mushrooms, but keep everything else pretty much the same.  this recipe is one that made it into my personal recipe notebook, excellent!

I was pleasantly satisfied with this recipe. I thought I would miss the sour cream, but I didn't I used a little extra of all the seasonings and the stroganoff was very flavorful and creamy. The only change I made was that I used steak instead of hamburger and vegetable broth instead of beef. My family really enjoyed this meal. One reviewer said it tasted like Hamburger Helper and I agree, but felt better about making this recipe rather than the processed powder in HH.

Awesome recipe my family adored it, including my inlaws who are usually very hard to please (were talking about how good it was the next day!)
I only added some garlic powder and a few turns from the pepper mill.
Other than that i followed it exactly and it was perfect! Definetly family fave now.

I really like this recipe!  I love beef stroganoff, but don't make it because my son has a dairy allergy.  This is so good, easy, tasty, not expensive and not totally unhealthy with lean meat.  I used corn starch instead of flour, fresh mushrooms because I don't like canned, chicken broth instead of beef because I didn't have beef broth, and even with all the substitutions it was really good.  I'll make this a lot!

I was looking for a way to use up some left over roast beef with a gravy and some noodles and this fit the bill perfectly and it was A+++ delicious.  I didn't make any other changes to the recipe.

I really like this recipe! I omitted the mushrooms because my children don't like them. Like another reviewer, I also increased the beef broth to one cup. I also didn't have any cream of mushroom on hand, so I used cream of golden mushroom. I served it over egg noodles and both kids including a picky eater ate it!

This was edible, but certainly not good.  My husband ate it.  He said it was good, but he will always be nice when it comes to comments on anyone's cooking.  I ate part of mine, but couldn't eat the rest of it.

Really good and easy. But I did add sour cream. Had some in the fridge and needed to use it soon.
 But all in all I loved the outcome and will use it again. Over noodles of course.
