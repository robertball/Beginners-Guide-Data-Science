great recipe!! i changed it a bit by substituting lamb stew meat for the anchovies. i floured and panfried the meat before adding it to the pie shell. i also sauteed the onions and mushrooms first to soften them. my fiancee loves it!

I used a ready-made pie shell as I'm too lazy to make my own. This turned out better than I expected but still not mind-blowing. I really liked the anchovy/goat cheese combination, but if I were to make it again, I would definitely omit the olives.
