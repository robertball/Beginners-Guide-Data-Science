This must be the real thing!  Served 6 of these cakes at a function at the Irish American Heritage Center in Chicago, - we had to put the crumbs out because everybody was clamoring for more!

Very easy indeed, and very good too - moist but crumbly. It is a fruit cake as we know them in Ireland and the UK; however I think it's a bit too sweet - a common failing in recipes adapted to the American taste, I find. I've made this a few times now and find it best with only half a cup of sugar, as the dried fruits add their own sweetness. You can use any dried fruits of your preference, of course - apples, apricots, dates, prunes, figs - whatever you like.

So many recipes for Irish boiled cakes. I refer to use white flour rather than whole wheat.  The latter tends to make it dry and certainly cut back on the sugar a little.  Still a pretty good little cake - we enjoy this type of cake sliced thinly with butter.
