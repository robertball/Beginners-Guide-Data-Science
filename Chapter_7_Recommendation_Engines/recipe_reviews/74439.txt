Sorry, this just didn't work for me. I brought it for a food day at work and ended up pulling it back and not serving it. It tasted just ok, nothing to rave about but it looked bad, like mush. It certainly wasn't worth the cost of the ingredients. Maybe it's because I made it the night before. It might be better if served right away. I am glad it worked for everyone else, it just wasn't a winner for me

I scaled this down for two, added a small can of kidney beans and added a little cumin to the ranch dressing.  My husband (who hates ranch dressing) loved it.  This is a great recipe that I'll be making again.  Thanks.

This really is a good salad that my family loves.  I brown the beef and throw in a package of taco seasoning for extra flavor.  I also mix equal amounts of ranch dressing and picante sauce and like to serve this salad over corn chips.  Have made this many times and always look forward to making it again.  :)

Very easy to throw together but oh so good!  This was my first time to make a taco salad, and I'm happy to report that I've found a keeper.  Even my picky DH gave the verdict of "World-class taco salad!"

I wanted to serve it with Beef Enchiladas, so I decided to omit the ground beef in the salad.  I also put the tortilla chips on the side, in case some of our dinner party prefer to not have any chips in their salad.  It tasted great: just like what you get at a regular Mexican restaurant!

I am asked to make this taco salad for every family function I attend and even for some that I'm not attending! The only change I make is adding a half of a packet of taco seasoning mix to the ground beef as I'm browning it. 

Delicious!

I have never tried Taco Salad with Ranch. That was really good. The whole family loved it. I mixed taco seasoning with the dressing, and Hamburger.

This was a great fast, yummy salad that was super for breakfast the next day too! ;D I used organic blue corn tortilla chips, and also 1 can of kidney beans in the meat for extra fiber. We served it with the meat on top, with sour cream and extra shredded cheese. Oh and don't forget the hot sauce. The recipe is just a great starting point, and you can add anything you love to make it your own!

This is great!!  the only thing I did different was put the chips out separate with a little note by them to add to the salad, for a great taco taste. maryhhug is absolutely correct!! you can not make this mixed the night before.  if you want to prep everything and keep the meat in a separate sealed container, the dressing in the bottle and the chips in the bag,warming up the meat slightly just before mixing it will work. you can't add meat, dressing and chips the night before without a soggy mess!

I don't like salsa, especially chunky salsa, but I love this salad.  No one could believe it had salsa in it (which it did) and no one could believe it did not have taco seasoning in it (which it didn't).  It's so easy to prepare and my family (30+ people) raved about and everyone wants the recipe!  It's a winner!

This is really good !  I added taco seasoning to the meat and mixed the ranch dressing, picante sauce and sour cream together.  I didn't have any fresh tomotoes so I used a can of rotel tomatoes, drained.  Awesome flavor !

This is a delicious, fresh recipe but is HUGE even when I cut the recipe in half. You would literally need a bucket to make this as written because of all the mixing required, but when I half it, I can use a very large bowl. I use ground turkey instead of beef and add taco seasoning to it while cooking. I add a can of drained and rinsed black beans and only 1 cup of cheese (for half the recipe). I also don't think you need quite the whole bottle of Ranch, but that depends on your taste.

a childhood friend's mother made something like this (w/o the meat, and with hidden valley ranch), so was very excited to find this recipe!?! have made it many times as written, to much praise from others, but thought i would review it as my husband is TDY, so i made it with a meatless soy substitute -- and it is just as good (Lightlife Smart Ground Mexican Style seasoned veggie protein crumbles :)

I love this recipe but I do add to it!  I don't add the tortilla chips to it, I let people put fresh crispy ones on their own.  I add two cans of drained kidney beans and I always brown the beef and add a packet of taco seasoning to it.  Very good!!

My daughter needed a dish for Spanish class. I had no idea how much salad there would be in this recipe so I took 1/2 of it to work. It was gone within the hour! We both returned home with empty bowls! Thanks for the recipe, will make again, for sure!

Excellent recipe! I added black olives and a red pepper to my recipe and it was amazing.  We had the left overs the next day with fresh chips on top and it was still very good.  Definitely a keeper.

I'm rating this 4 stars, but with taco seasoning added to the beef and some other changes this was five stars.  I added some avocado, black olives, and crumpled up Doritos instead of plain tortilla chips .

This was the best of the best for me and the best family but my great grandpa it was too greasy for him. The only thing I don't think that I can see is that it was not the same thing over the last few days and the other hand this is the only thing that I have made for my birthday and the other side of the best day ever is a good time.

Very filling salad, not good for a side salad. Excellent for a party.
