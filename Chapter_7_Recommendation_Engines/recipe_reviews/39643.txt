WOW!!  These are certainly tasty little devils.  My six year old loves them.  I am not a huge tomato fan but I loved them too.  Guests were fighting over the last one and decided to cut in half!!  The only thing I think I might change next time is to use 1/2 mayo and 1/2 cream cheese (maybe garden vegetable).  I just think that would help the "oily" consitancy.  Thank you so much for the post, Angela.  Update:  Tried this with 1/2 mayo & 1/2 garden vegetable cream cheese.  Even yummier!

love 'em!  some tips here:  to prevent them from rolling around, don't cut the TOP off, cut the BOTTOM off and leave the top.  also, I usually drain upside down of paper towel.  one last thing - I use my food processor to get the bacon really chopped up, then fold in other ingredients.

I suggest sprinkling salt in the tomato cavities after removing the seeds and pulp.  Then, turn the tomatoes upside down on a paper towel for a short while to let the excess juices drain.  The salt brings in a little extra flavor as well as pulling out some of the excess juice.  Excellent recipe!

Excellent recipe for those watching carbs!  Using low fat mayo and sour cream as other reviewers have suggested reduces the calorie content as well.  We like chives vs green onions for a more delicate flavor.  Hollowed out, salted to drain upside down, bottoms nipped just a little to stand upright, stuffed, two small chives laid across the top for presentation and you have a beautiful appetizer worthy of any waiters tray!

I must admit, based on prior reviews i wasn't quite sure what I was getting myself into:  some stated it was very time-consuming, others said it was a snap. I found this to be a fairly simple recipe.  I "gutted" my tomatoes using a knife to cut off the top and then hollowed w/my "dash" measuring spoon.  Per anouther review, I lightly salted the tomatoe and placed upside down on paper towels.  I'm not a big cream cheese fan, so I used equal parts light mayo and fat free cream cheese along w/real bottled bacon bits, a dash of garlic powder, and chives for the filling.  I used a Ziploc to pipe the filling into the tomatoes just prior to serving.  I will def make these again, esp now that gardens are over-flowing w/cherry tomatoes!  THANKS for a keeper!

Made this recipe for 8 people tonight.  7 asked me for the recipe (I was the 8th!).  I made a few changes that I hope will be helpful...I cut the tiniest bit off the bottom of the cherry tomatoes so that they would stand up on the plate instead of rolling around.  I substituted half of the mayonnaise with sour cream and I threw in a few chopped leafs of lettuce.  After all, what's a "BLT" without the "L"?!?  Followed others' advice and salted the tomatoes before stuffing.  Someone suggested using a pastry bag to flute the mixture into the tomatoes but I found that that created a big mess--the bacon chunks never fit through the hole (no matter how big I made it).  So, in my first batch, I had a whole bunch of tomatoes with nothing but sour cream and mayo filling.  Use a spoon or your fingers!  My tomatoes were fairly small, but I had no problem using the small end of a melon baller to de-seed them.

I really had serious misgivings when I started to make these, because I had the cherry tomatoes from hell. They were very small and had a very tough inner "wall" right in the middle that I couldn't get out without ruining the tomatoes (even though I used my 1/4 tsp measuring spoon, which is metal and has a fairly sharp edge). This made them very difficult to stuff--in fact, I think a lot of them ended up wearing most of the filling as a "hat", so they were sort of messy, but I solved this by sticking a toothpick in them. Despite the problems, these were a huge success. I followed others' advice and used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 cream cheese, and topped them with crushed croutons (garlic flavored). I also left out the parsley, and used chives instead of green onions. They were really, really good, so I'm sure I'll make them again, despite the PITA factor. Thanks for the recipe! Edited to add: These always go over well with everyone, but one of my friends in particular (who is not fond of tomatoes) is always dropping hints for me to make these again. They're always worth the trouble.

You HAVE to make it with half cream cheese and half mayo...much better that way.  Croutons crumbled on the top is a must too.  The extra crunch is great.  I turned the tomatoes upside down to hollow them out.  They don't roll around that way.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

Excellent addition to a hot/cold array of appetizers, and an attractive one too!  Hubs made these and found the measurements of ingredients to be spot on for our tastes.  No hassle at all since he used a pastry bag (with no tip) to fill these but a plastic ziploc bag would work just as well. This gets the job done lickety-split, with no muss, no fussl  Delicious.  Bonus points on this appetizer for being low carb!

I have made this twice now, and both times they were the first thing eaten off the buffet table and I got requests for the receipe.  Per other reviews, here's what I do:  Instead of 1/2 cup mayo...I use 1/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup cream cheese.  Also, I buy the bacon in the bag that's already cooked and chopped.  Take the tomatoes and cut the top off...not the end where the stem was.  That way, they will sit on the plate without rolling.  I cut off the top and scoop out the insides and then turn over on a paper plate with a paper towel on it and let them drain while I put the rest of the stuff together.  I put the stuffing in a zip lock bag and cut a hole in the corner and that way it's easier to stuff the tomatoes.  Yum!!

Oh my gosh these are just the best!  I have made them 2 times now and each time people just go on about how great these things are.  My boyfriend HATES tomatos, won't even do tomato sauce but he just loves these!  I used a baby spoon to take out the insides of the tomatos.  I also just took a freezer bag and cut the corner off and used that to stuff the "sauce" into the tomato.  I added just little garlic powder, salt and pepper to the mix and it was just great.  I also have learned to place the tomatos on the tray or in the dish first before stuffing them, they hold each other up and make it easier to stuff.  I also recommend that they spend some time in your fridge I let mine sit a few hours and that helps them firm up a little.  Trust me you will really enjoy these and they really do not take that much time.

Excellent---tedious to make because of the hollowing out the tomatoes, but definitely a hit at the party.  I hollowed out my tomatoes (stored upside down in tupperware on a papertowel overnight) & made the filling the day before & then filled them the day of the party.  Worked great.  I've made these a couple times since and they've been a huge hit everywhere.  I did find that using my knife when I cut off the tops to kind of cut the membrane inside works really well to get the seeds out.  I also found that my 1/2 teaspoon works really good to scoop out the insides.  It works really well to make the day which is what I like.

I followed another reviewer's advice and used half cream cheese and half mayonaise.  Also, based on another recipe, I added a little horseradish and it really seemed to give that sometime extra it needed.  I cut the tops of the tomatos and drained them for 30 minutes on a paper towel.  Then I put the filling in a food storage bag and then cut the corner off.  It was so much easier to pipe it into the tomato then to try to use a spoon.  Next time, I will cut a small portion off the bottom of the tomato to help them stay upright on the platter.
UPDATE: I made these with garlic and herb flavor Borsin cheese in addition to the block of cream cheese and they were amazing. I used yellow cherry tomatoes, and they seemed to walk off the plate. I did shave off a little bit of the bottom and it worked like a charm.

I got RAVE reviews on this one. and it didn't take long at all to throw it together.  If you don't have a melon baller, try using a measuring spoon instead.

People love these whenever I serve them no matter what type of occasion.  When I first saw the recipe I thought, too much mayo - substitute some cream cheese.  Then I saw the reviews and was glad someone had done the work for me.  I also like exchanging the chives for the green onion.  To keep the cherry tomatoes from rolling, put the stem side down and cut from the other side.  That also makes it easier to bypass the thick membrane under the stem.  When your tomatoes are small or with some grape tomatoes,  simply slice them in half.  It will make your job so much easier, and the finished product so much cleaner.

I call these BLT bites & the only change I make, is to add about 3 tbp. of grated parmesan cheese (fresh is best). I use my granddaughter's baby spoon to scoop out the tomatoes...very effective. I pour a bed of kosher salt on a platter to serve them on. That keeps them from rolling about & makes a great presentaton.

These are always a hit at any gathering, and it is nice to have a healthier option admist all the chocolate and cakes. I use a melon baller and this speeds the process up considerably.

Have made previously, but just completed 200 hundred for a WEDDING.  After much posting research and testing, think I have all the easy and best tricks.

Cut off BOTTOMS!

1/2 mayo & 1/2 cream cheese

Dry ranch dressing mix

REAL Prepackaged bacon bits BLENDERIZED

Blenderize all veggies.  Blenderizing makes it so easy to pipe filling through plastic bags or pastry bag.

Top with Italian bread crumbs.

BEST OF ALL For an added flavor kick that is hard to quite define, add BEAU MONDE seasoning to the cream mixture.  

THANKS TO EVERYONE FOR HELPING ME WITH THIS ONE.

As for the bordom and messiness of prepping the tomatoes, after washing, I first chop the bottoms off all the tomatoes and drop them into two seperate containers (tomato/shells or bottoms/refuse).  Then sitting on the couch watching TV, I firmly place a small metal measuring spoon and a firm thumb against both sides of the innermost membrane of the tomato shell and twist, it usually pulls right up. Then disgard guts back into the other bowl and place the gutted tomato right side up directly onto a cookie sheet till filled.
Then salt tomato shells, cover with paper towels, then bath towels, another cookie sheet and flip over.(paper towels can only absorb so much water, you will be amazed at how the bath towels pull the excess out).  Place in fridge till needed.

I really wanted to be thrilled with this recipe  because I had an abundance of cherry tomatoes from my garden.  Unfortunately,  I ended up being disappointed.  I had read ALL the reviews and followed all the helpful advice. I salted the tomatoes, I drained them on paper towels. This little appetizers still just tasted very greasy/fatty to me.  Even my husband said that there was too much filling and not enough of a tomato taste. And these were incredibly labor intensive and time consuming.  I will be making and reviewing the BLT dip; hopefully I will  have better luck with that appetizer.

I filled mine with bacon, crumbled blue cheese, and chopped cucumber and called them Baby Cobbs. They were a huge hit at the party I brought them to, and making them wasn't as tedious as I'd feared. I will definitely make these again.

These are great!  I did take the recommendation of other reviewers and mixed half mayo and half cream cheese for the base, and I added chopped shredded lettuce to make it a 'true' BLT.  Since cherry tomatoes are just out of season, my husband found Campari tomatoes, and they worked beautifully.

DELICIOUS!! I scaled this recipe down to 6 servings and used freshly picked cherry tomatoes from my garden.  After cutting the tops of the tomatoes and removing the seeds, sprinkled with salt and turned upside down to drain. I added shredded sharp cheddar cheese and used onion powder in place of the green onion. These were good at room temperature but even tasted better after being in the fridge. Will make again!

I made these because of the great reviews and was a little disappointed. I used the precooked bacon so that might have been the problem. It was INSANELY salty and I'm a NaCl addict. I added about 4oz cream cheese and it was still too salty. I had sour cream in the fridge and after adding that they were good. I was too lazy to stuff all the tomatoes so I cut them in half and served with toothpicks and crackers.

I've made these several times since finding this recipe a couple years ago. They are SO good and are a real crowd pleaser. I use either half mayo/half sour cream or half mayo/half whipped cream cheese so it's not oily. Both are very good. I skip the onions (not a favorite around this house) and add a little garlic powder. To make stuffing super easy I put the mixture in a Ziploc and cut the corner off, then just pipe the mixture in. Love this recipe! Thanks for sharing with us :)

These were good. 
A little TIP to get the filling in the tomatoes..... is to take a freezer bag and fill it with the filling mix. Then cut a small amount of the corner off to make a pastry bag out of it....then just gentley squeeze into the tomatoes!

This is a lot quicker than trying to stuff them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
another tip..Try to get as much juice out of the tomatoes as you can, it tends to make the filling runny. Putting these in the Fridge for a while after assembled would help too.

it was a little extra work, but it was worth it.  A big hit at the church dinner.  I used only the tops of the green onions to get the added green color.  I'm thinking next time I would add a bit of grated cheese to some of the mixture as a variation.

I took these to an office party four months ago and am still getting recipe requests. I salt the cored tomatoes and lay them upside down to drain before stuffing. Also use half mayo and half sour cream for better consistency and use turkey bacon for a better health factor. I sprinkled crushed croutons over the top and viola! So good!

This was easy and quick to make. Will make a perfect low carb alternative to the traditional BLT on toast. I skipped the parsley simply because I didn't have any. For my personal taste I'll include some diced tomato next time because I like veggie-heavy recipes and want a lower mayo level. I also like the idea someone had to use half cream cheese, so maybe I'll try that too.

I think this recipe is flawless! (w/the 1/4 cream cheese, 1/4 mayo) This little guys are quite yummy! It was pretty time consuming and a bit of a pain (with them rolling around, even when you cut the bottoms) but they were so worth it. I think next time I will cut them in halves horizontally so they will not fall over. Thanks for an awesome recipe!

YUUMMYYYYY!!  What a great recipe - especially for parties.  I made this for my sister-in-laws baby shower and they were the first thing gone.  I used large cherry type tomatoes from Sam's Club.  They were easier to remove seeds from and fill.  I also used pre-crumbled bacon.  You use about 1/4 of a pound of bacon doing it the 'cheaters' way!  I think I gave the recipe to everyone at the shower.

These were great except for how time consuming they were. They tasted great, and the extra filling I just put in a bowl with chips and it was BLT dip! a hit at the super bowl sunday.

I can't say anything about this particular recipe, but I make an almost identical version that has all of the same ingredients...PLUS (and this is what makes it, in my book!) TOAST! You mix all the above ingredients with tiny cubed pieces of toast (made with white bread, of course), and THEN stuff it in the tomato. Ooh they're heavenly. And, surprisingly, the toast does not get too soggy if you make it a nice golden brown, let it cool, then mix it in. I have many friends who request these everytime we have a party! I also serve mine on  bed of lettuce (hence the T part of the BLT.) Enjoy!

This is the most Number 1 requested dish that I bring to family get togethers.  OF COURSE it's time consuming (stuffed cherry tomato's, what do you think?) But the time is well worth it because people rave every time! I add garlic powder to the mix and use miracle whip, and less of it.  (just enough to make it stick!) I would recommend making the mix the day before and storing it in the fridge over night.  It allows the bacon flavor to really "brighten" up!  I LOVE this recipe... but beware... if you make this once for other people, you will be making them for the rest of your life!  Don't say I didn't warn you!

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Made these for a potluck at work and they were a HIT! Even the co-worker who does NOT like tomatoes thought they were wonderful! Previous reviewers indicated that these were pain-staking to make. Found it very simple to "gut" the tomatoes with a metal baby spoon and then "pipe" the filling in through a zip-lock or sandwich baggie with a little hole in the corner. Not difficult at all! Will definately make these again!

Got good reviews at a party.  Here are my changes...used 1/4 cup mayo, 1/4 cup chive cream cheese, subbed turkey bacon (which I chopped in food processor), and most importantly, cut the tomatoes length-wise, scooped out each half and filled both.  Much easier to scoop that way.
Garnished with extra green onions and chopped bacon.
Would look even better on a bed of lettuce!

These are great!  Simple, easy, tasty and everyone I've ever served them to absolutely loves them.  After making them several times, I have to agree with other reviewers.  Half mayo, half cream cheese and let them sit in the fridge at least a couple of hours.  They are one of the first things to go, particularly in the summer when the tomatoes are fresh.

Made this for my annual Oscar Party, and it was a hit!  I followed the suggestions to use half mayo, half cream cheese, and I really think that it gave it a good flavor and texture.  Was surprised with how tasty these were.  Only knocked off a star, because scooping out the cherry tomatoes was a bit time consuming and with small tomatoes almost impossible.  Would definitely make again!  Thanks!

These were very good and made a pretty presentation.  I used real bacon bits which maybe wasn't quite authentic but saved heating the kitchen.  It did make a lot more than I needed, but I mixed the filling with some cream cheese and herbs to make a really nice dip, so I didn't mind the extras.

These are great.  I followed a recipe similar to this, only it added 2 tablespoons of parmesan cheese (which I think gives it more flavor).  And it is time consuming, but so completely worth every bite!

These were quite tasty, but if I make them again I will change it up a bit.  The stuffing was mostly bacon, and the other flavors got lost.  So I will either only use 1/2 pound of bacon, or increase the mayo/cream cheese mixture from 1/2 cup total to 1-cup.  I wanted more of the other flavors, and all I really got was bacon... So, good recipe, but it definitely needs tweaking.

These are delicious and a hit whenever I make them!  They aren't as hard as some people say to make.  I just put the mixture into a plastic bag, cut a hole and pipe it into the tomatoes.  Easy!  Make sure you get bigger cherry tomatoes.  That helps.

Great recipe, the only change I made was to add 1/4c of softened cream cheese. Wow, we had a bbq supper and these were a hit. They are time consuming, but worth it!

These were good although they are time consuming. I hollowed out the tomatoes and salted them and turned them upside down on a paper towel overnight to drain out the water. I also put the filling together the night before. The day of the party I just had to stuff the tomatoes. They were good and I received many compliments. Will probably make again!

Not hard to make, but a little time-consuming.  However, when you want to impress people, Baby BLT's look and taste great!  But for a football game, I would probably make BLT dip with pita chips.

Wow! These are fantastic! Beautiful and fun to make. I didin't really read the reviews before making and didn't realize so many people added a bit of cream cheese. I actually added sour cream to the mix because I love the Blt Dip from this site and that is the way it is made. It was excellent with the sour cream, and I am sure excellent with cream cheese also. I halved the recipe and made only 12. My husband had to restrain himself from eating the whole platter!

I added 1/2 the amout of mayo and the other half cream cheese, used chives since they were smaller to squeeze through the pastry bag.  Make sure everything is chopped fine.  Salting the insides of the tomato  adds extra flavor as well.  Try you 1/2 metal teaspoon to remove centers of tomato, it works great!

These adorable bite sized blt's are great.  The spread would be great on a bagel.  I made the stuffing part the night before and then added 2 tablespoons of mayo the next morning to get the right consistency.  I also added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and about 2 tablespoons of freshly grated parmesan cheese - a nice touch.  Served on platter with leaf lettuce to help keep them upright instead of cutting off the bottoms.

I catered a holiday Christmas party for 100.  This was a smashing hit.  It was all we could do to stay out of them ourselves.  We were fighting over them and knew there would never be enough if we did not stop somewhere.  So we made a batch just for all my workers.  Beautiful on the plate and looks great with dark green leaves underneath.

I made these for a girls night and they were a hit.  But, most of us found them to be too oily and I had used the 1/2 mayo & 1/2 cream cheese.  I think next time I will do 1/4 mayo, 3/4 cream cheese.  Otherwise, delicious and honestly, for an appetizer not that difficult.  
I'm sure we've all made things that are more tasky.  Next tomato season I will be planting a cherry tomato plant just for these!

If your tomatoes are very small a melon baller will probably be too large to do the scooping.  A demitasse spoon will work perfectly.

I had such high hopes for these as I'm a BLT & mayo fanatic! Sadly, they fell short, although I haven't given up on them just yet. Some reviewers suggested using half cream cheese and half mayo which I think will be much more appetizing. I suggest using 1 tablespoon of parsley instead of two as it was far too much. Next time around I'm not going to scoop out the insides of the tomatoes as that's the best part!

These were good but I didn't LOVE them. I'd make them again for a party though, they were pretty easy to make (though hollowing out the tomatoes was more of a pain than I thought it'd be!) I took some reviewer suggestions to add cream cheese because I didn't think I'd really care for using all mayo (I only had reduced fat mayo and it's not the great to eat a mouthful of.. ), but I think just a touch of cream cheese would have been better than using about half cream cheese/half mayo.

Love Love Love this recipe! Thank you. I went with the 1/2 mayo, 1/2 cream cheese recommendation and I'm glad I did. I used fresh parsley, green onion and real bacon cooked in the oven so it was easy to crumble. I used tomatoes on the vine, a little bigger than cherry tomatoes, and it worked great. I also used the plastic bagmethod to squirt the mixture into the cups so the mess was minimized. SO worth the trouble. This was a hit on Superbowl at my house. :)

I get raves every time I make these! I used some other suggestions: I use 1/2 Kraft Free Mayo and 1/2 fat free sour cream, cut a tiny slice off the bottom to keep them from rolling, and drain upside-down on paper towels so the tomatoes aren't so wet. Great!!!

Everytime I make these people absolutely devour them and ask for the recipe.  To make it easier to fill the tomatoes and also for when I have to transport them to a party, I put the filling in a zip lock bag.  When I get to the party I quickly arrange the tomatoes on a serving tray and then cut a corner off the bag and use it like a pastry bag to fill them without handling them.  Keeps the filling where it needs to be and keeps my hands clean too.  Don't have to worry about them rolling around in the car either.

I just made these today for a family get together and they were GONE in minutes. I used campari tomatoes so they were larger than grape tomatoes and easier to work with.  I also did a half cup of mayo mixed with a half cup of cream cheese instead of all mayo. They were delicious!!  I had several requests for the recipe as well as compliments from everyone.

These were a hit at the party we had!  So good and so cute, but I'm not sure I'll put the effort in again anytime soon.  It really takes a lot of patience to spoon / get out the middle of the tomato.

These were Okay.  I used mayo and sour cream as suggested by others as well as sprinkling with salt and draining.  The small side of a melon baller definitely made it easier.  The parmesan cheese definitely helped.

I followed the recipe exactly.  Turned out great.  My cherry tomotoes were very small so I cut them in half and scooped out the seeds and put in the filling.  Do make sure you use real mayonaise.  I did not think they were that difficult to make, not all that time consuming.  Covered them and put them back into the fridge until I was ready to serve them.  They really do taste like a BLT.

SO good! I followed lots of advice from others including salting the tomatoes and draining them on a paper towel. I also mixed half mayo and half cream cheese. I used Capri tomatoes which are larger, and I was able to use a paring knife and my finger to clear out the tomatoes. Also, because this was for a special party, I tore a tiny piece of Romaine lettuce and tucked it into each tomato half. Beautiful and tasty!

As others have stated, these are a PITA, but well worth it.  (I accidentally bought large grape tomatoes which added to the difficulty).  People devoured these.  I salt and peppered the cavities and turned them upside down for a couple of minutes while I was stuffing others.  Once you get moving it goes pretty quickly. I ended up with leftover filling though.  I made these to take to camp for 4th of July...very cute if you place underneath a patriotic napkin!

Too much work! But tasty. These disappeared in a hurry. I used cream cheese with chives for 1/2 of the mayo. Be sure to cut your bacon up very small if using a good quality bacon because it will not crumble. I put all of my filling in a zip lock and mixted it that way. If you slice off the bottoms of the tomatoes, the insides do not scoop out easily but they don't roll on you. I opted to still scoop out the tops so I could make these faster.

Everyone loved these when I made them for a Labor Day party. It's definitely wise to prep the night before.  Tried cutting off tops and bottoms and had problems getting these to stand up after they were filled no matter which I tried. My tomatoes were pretty small so I ended up getting about 35.

I love these! Next time I will use reduced sodium bacon because they were a little salty.  I also added a half of a package of reduced fat cream cheese and a 1/4 cup of low fat sour cream. As someone else suggested, I cut the bottoms off so they didn't roll around and it worked perfectly. Very much worth the time it took to make them. They were a big hit at the party I took them to.

These are a great little surprise! Got some unsure faces from the family, but once they tasted them, they couldn't get enough of them! Very YUMMY and different from your average appetizer. Served cold, the more your chew on these the more the flavor melds together! Wonderful! I let the filling sit overnight in a covered bowl and added about 1 tbsp more of mayo before filling. Thanks!

I cut this recipe in half for a football party I had today (I made 8 different dishes and didn't want alot of leftovers). I used strawberry tomatoes and it turned out cutting it in half still filled 22 of them. I did add some shredded lettuce to the mix because I couldn't see serving BLT with out the L. They were fantastic!

This was wonderful - I made 35 (2 pints) for a Christmas Eve appetizer and there was not a single one left!!
I followed the earlier suggestions of using half mayo and half cream cheese, and also added a dash of ranch seasoning. Thank you for a real winner!!! I will be using this again very soon!

These were pretty good. My hiusband thought they were great. We made them for a party but they were barely eaten. As for making them, I used a the smallest measuring spoon I think it was 1/8 inch and this made it esay for scooping out the seeds. I also used the 1/2 mayo 1/2 cream cheese otherwise they might have been to oily.

Good with cream cheese & mayo.  I inserted toothpicks into the bottom of the tomatoes and then stood them up on a styrofoam base, they looked good and had their own little handle.

These were very tasty, and I received compliments on them at my party.  I will warn you, to say they are pain to make, assemble, and present is an understatement.  I tried to slice a little off the bottom of each tomato so they wouldn't roll around, but that caused a hole through the tomato in some cases.  So, I just let them roll.  If there was a way to present them better, I would make them again.  Another tip -- make sure you have very large cherry tomatoes to make it easier.  I thought mine were pretty big, but I had about 1/2 cup of stuffing remaining.

These were a hit at my recent Housewarming party. I did use the 1/2 Cream Cheese and 1/2 Mayo. 3 TBSP Parm. cheese and Croutons. My only word of advice is..have a sharp knife and Pastry Bag. I learned that these can be very time consuming to make if you don't have the right "tools" I made them the night before put them in tupperware and they were fine! Enjoy

I made these appetizers for a party where I really wanted to "impress" with something different.   These little babies went over and above in effect!  Not only did they look great (and different), but the taste is amazing.   After reading some of the other reviews, I also added some cream cheese to the mayo (about half and half), just to make the filling a bit more thick.   Also, I love cream cheese....  I added the crushed croutons on the top as well  - whomever suggested that first had a great idea!   Perfect.   The only thing is the fact that they do roll around...  When I made them I'd forgotten to get the shredded lettuce, but I think that would work for sure.  I'll try that next time I make them...  Thanks for the awesome recipe!!!!!!

The best recipe I have had from allrecipes.  Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.  Well worth every minute it took to make.  I have a new favorite cold finger-food.  I did add roasted garlic to the mix but I am sure they would have been just as good without.

WONDERFUL! These are tasty little things! If I can only figure out how to stop eating them as I make em! .... if I had to offer advice on this recipe i'd say to buy more cherry tomatoes than the 24 recommended... I ended up filling 45 tomatoes! Thanks Angela for this delicious appetizer!

These were served amongst a lot of other dishes at my family reunion.  I ate one and then managed to eat the rest of the platter.  Anyone who approached the same platter got their hand smacked away as I snapped at them like a rabid dog.  I ate nothing else but these.  I reminisce about them still. I'll never forget that day.

These are amazing. One thing to make these easier is to use grape tomatoes just cut in half long ways. Use a melon ball small and it make removing pulp easy and no rolling. I added more mayonnaise because I used thick bacon. I also cooked the bacon in the oven, I lined a cookie sheet with foil and put oven at 400 degrees bake single layer for 12 to 14 Minutes. Put cooked bacon on paper towels to cool and drain grease. I also used a chopper to finley chop all ingredients before combining. Put mixture of ingredients to a zip lock bag snip corner and fill. This was so much faster to make them and they we a big hit at the party "Everyone loved them".

For our Christmas Eve appetizers, I slaved all day making all sorts of goodies. But it was the 24 Baby BLTs that disappeared in less than 15 minutes after the guests arrived! Everyone was "mmm-ing" with their mouths full! LOL

The larger cherry tomatoes (about 1-1/2" in diameter) were the perfect size for coring, stuffing and eating.

I took the advice of others and mixed 1/4 cup mayo with 1/4 cup softened cream cheese, and I think it made all the difference. As others also suggested, I LIGHTLY salted and drained the tomatoes for a few minutes before stuffing, and crumbed croutons on top. I didn't bother to slice the bottom because they held each other upright - and they never lasted long enough to roll around on the plate, anyway.

This will be my "go to" appetizer recipe from now on -but I'll be sure to double or triple it!

Too much filling for the two dozen cherry tomatoes I had. I took others' advice and used garden vegetable cream cheese for half the mayo, I also added celery and dried chives. This is tedious, but certainly not difficult. Everyone loved them!

I needed to transport these to a party.  To keep them from rolling around while driving, I got a 1" thick piece of styrofoam at the craft store.  I wrapped it like a gift with a  square of pretty fabric and topped it with some leafy lettuce, held in place with toothpicks. I then arranged the tomatoes on top and placed a frilly toothpick in each tomato, anchoring it in the styrofoam.  I covered it loosely with plastic wrap, and popped it in the cooler with a couple of blue ice packs. It traveled perfectly, and  I had a lightweight, pretty "tray" and the guests could use the toothpick to pick up the tomato, if desired.

I made these for my daughter's Fairy themed bday party and they were a hit! The mixture got a little oily from the bacon, so next time I will try cooking it in the oven.

Have served these several times now and its been a hit every time!  I do add a handful of finely shredded cheddar cheese, some garlic powder and black pepper.  Scooping out the tomatoes is by far the worst part, but worth it in the end.

These are awesome!  I agree with the other reviewers that the salting process is helpful.  I served in a round dish with a toothpick in each one to make serving cleaner and easier.  Last tip: cut the bacon short-ways before you put it in the pan; this way it is pre-diced before you cook it, and it saves time.  Chop again after you've cooked and cooled to get it very fine.

These were very good, but very labor intensive. Next time, I might put a little less mayonnaise in there.

These take some time to make but are well worth it. I made these for a Christmas party as an appetizer and everyone LOVED them. Very, very TASTY! 

To help with the presentation, I used a very sharp knife to slice a tiny bit off the bottom of each tomato. This helped them to stand up straight on the presentation platter and stopped them from falling over.

Always a hit at family functions and parties. I get requests for these all the time. The big difference I make is cream cheese instead of mayo.

I couldn't bare the thought of all of that mayo or cream cheese (sounded way too heavy), so I used greek yogurt (sour cream works too), much lighter and creamier. Made it for a baby shower and it was a real crowd pleaser.

It's delicious as the recipe is written. I prefer mine without the bacon and every time I've served it, I've had rave reviews. Suggest piping the filling into the tomatoes. Definitely a time saver.

We had a game night a couple of weeks ago for 10 people and I made a double batch of these. (About 60 tomatoes)   Even though we had enough appetizers and snacks to feed about 30 people, these little goodies were gone in 20 minute.  (One gal confessed she ate 15 of them!!)  The only difference...I forgot to buy parsley, so I added a little more of the green onions.  A little time consuming to make, but DEFINITELY worth it.

good idea but really hard to execute. i tried to pipe in the bacon mixture but the bacon got stuck in the hole. Maybe if you finally chop the bacon or pulse it in the food processor. I got so frustrated that I ended up trashing these. boooo

These are absolutely faantastic. As others have said, time consuming, but definitely worth the effort. I use the pre-cooked bacon and run it through my food processor. Definitely better with half cream cheese and half mayo.  These are such a huge hit, every time I have a party or get together people call me to ask "are the little tomatoes going to be there?"  Thanks so much for the amazing recipe!

I made these for a pot luck business party and thought that not only were they more work than they were worth, they just didn't taste "right" to me, and they were hardly touched at the party.  I used half mayo half cream cheese and I felt the consistency was too thick.  If I am going to spend time hollowing out something and want the wow factor along with gourmet taste, I am going to stick to the cheesecake stuffed strawberries from this site.  I just didn't think they tasted that great.  Sorry :(

I made these as a starter to a dinner party but I used large beef tomatoes and served one half per guest.  I scooped out the tomatoes and sprinkled in garlic powder as someone suggested.  I also added a little plain yogurt to the mixture to lighten the taste of the mayonnaise.

SOOOOOO good!  These were gone about 10 minutes after I put them out on the 4th of July!  I made some changes because I hate mayo.  I used grape tomatoes, sliced long ways, like a baked potato- made it much easier to fill and I didn't have to scoop out the insides.  Also, I used turkey bacon, which tasted just as good, and cream cheese b/c like I said, I hate mayo.  I used a ziploc baggie with the corner cut out to fill, and it worked great!  I have been giving this recipe out ever since, and its my new favorite appetizer!

WOW!!! I made these for a jewelry party thanks to a suggestion, and was requested to make them AND bring the recipe for memorial day two days later! Went diet on it, used light miracle whip, 1/3 less fat cream cheese, turkey bacon, and added ff chedar cheese. I also used roma tomatoes instead bc they are easier to mess with than the tiny cherry, but still small enough to be a good finger food.

Made these for bunco using grape tomatoes (because the cherry tomatoes in my local store were nowhere near ripe).  I used the small end of my metal melon ball scoop to clean the tomatoes.  The platter was empty in less than 10 minutes!  Really, really good.

I made this on Christmas eve, and my guests were so impressed.  It was time consuming, but not hard to do.  I wish I had used larger tomatoes.  At the time, I could only find the very small grade tomatoes.  Anyway, I wouldn't make this often, but they were very good!

These were a hit at the New Year's party!  I used large grape tomatoes, which helped keep these perfect for popping in your mouth, but increased the PITA factor when filling.  Also increased the amount of mayo/cream cheese a little as the filling seemed quite heavy on the bacon........... mmmmmmmmmm....... baaaaaconnn. Serving these on a bed of spring mix helped to keep them upright.

This was a great recipe...my family loves it and has requested it frequently. To make this a little faster I made as a salad, mixing all ingredients with chopped romaine lettuce. The dressing I made the 1/2 C. mayo, 8oz cream cheese and added a little milk to thin for tossing with other ingredients.

After reading many reviews, I followed the advice of making the  filling and hollowing out the tomatoes the day before. Very helpful. I found a grapefruit knife to be the perfect tool for hollowing out a tomato without tearing it and a zip lock baggie perfect for piping it in. I used sour cream instead of the cream cheese (actually a non-dairy version due to lactose intolerance , and it was still great. It gave it a lighter texture, I think. Everyone loved them and I would make them again. Also, they are different so no one had seen them before!

Fantastic!!! Stumbled across this yesterday and SO happy I did. Best when served right away after mixing the bacon with the mayo to retain the crunch. Made 1/2 regular recipe (for my hubby), 1/2 vegetarian (for me)- used a few chopped veggie bacon slices, shredded lettuce and some shredded cheese for the veg version. will make again and again. will aslo try the same recipe, minus bacon, with tuna for a tuna salad appetizer. Can't wait. WONDERFUL RECIPE!!! thank you for submitting.

Did not enjoy making this recipe as it was very tedious, it was also not worth the effort.

Great recipe! Was the first thing to disappear at our work holiday open house. I used very little mayo and mostly spreadable cream cheese (in the container). I forgot the green onion and it didn't even need it. I cut the fat off the bacon before cooking for less fat and more protein and also used kitchen scissors to cut versus crumble the bacon.     I cut the tops and bottoms off my cherry tomatoes as they didn't stand up. BUT I used small muffin paper cups to hold them which made them easy to pick up and was a nice display.    Try to find the largest cherry tomatoes you can find and grab the man in the house to help with the coring of them!

These were absolutely delicious!  I made them for my cookie exchange party, and by far they were the hit of the party.  My sister who doesn't like tomatoes ate many of these!  They definitely are time consuming.  The larger cherry tomatoes are the best for this recipe.  And I took the recommendation of other reviewers to use 1/2 mayonnaise and 1/2 sour cream.  I made the filling ahead of time and refrigerated it overnight.  I also prepped the tomatoes the night before, and drained them on paper towels in the refrigerator.  Both of these steps cut down on the time I had to  refrigerate the assembled product--which was good for me because it took longer to fill the tomatoes than I had alloted!

I found tomatoes that were slightly larger than cherry tomatoes at my local grocery. Scooping out the tomatoes was much easier this way. I doubled the recipe for filling, as I worried I might not have enough, and found I had extra (Which I plan on eating on a slice of bread with tomato this afternoon!) Stuffing the tomatoes was easy enough, using my son's baby spoons. I cooked all the bacon the night before, and stored it in a ziplock bag. I followed a few of the reviews and used half cream cheese instead of the full content of mayo - and I found it to be perfect. Guests simply loved these. Thanks for a different and delicious recipe!

Mmm! Yum!  These were delicious and not difficult to do at all!  We used a spoon to hollow out and to stuff.   A deviled-egg dish worked well to keep them from falling over.  Next time we'd add freshly cracked black pepper.   Thanks Catmaniacs!

Had only 12 grape, cherry, and pear tomatoes so I scaled down the servings. Tasted better than my FIL's made up recipe for Baby BLTs. Next time, I'll stick with cherry tomatoes because they were easier to deal with. Served with "Lasagna Alfredo" and "Strawberry Spinach Salad I."

I've made a variation of this recipe for years and it's always a hit at parties!  I do not use green onion, and to make the bacon crispier and less greasy, I zap it in the microwave.  It cuts down the prep and clean-up time dramatically.  Also, I don't usually hollow the tomatoes out - I simply add the bacon, lettuce and mayonnaise into one of the cavities, creating an interesting look!  DELICIOUS!!!

These were a huge hit at my DD's bday party! It was Veggietales theme and I wanted as many tasty veggie appetizers as possible. I did use half cr. cheese as others suggested, and real bacon bits instead of cooking the bacon. I didn't have one left. Thanks so much!

I found it was better to NOT cut the bottoms off.  I managed to scoop out the tomatoes with a combination of sharp knife, small measuring spoon and my fingers.  I took others advice and salted and drained on paper towels, used a package of the pre-cooked bacon, 1/4 cup sour cream, 1/4 cup low-fat cream cheese and 2T. mayo.  And the chopped green onions, of course.  I added some garlic powder to the mix and left out the parsley.  I used a disposable pastry bag without a decorating tip to fill; that was the easiest part.  I didn't have enough tomatoes to fill my serving dish so I decorated the perimeter with fresh basil to help the tomatoes stand up.  I took to a thanksgiving party and everyone loved them.

These taste amazing, and the filling is very easy to make.  I got rave reviews when I took them to a potluck.  However (and the reason I am docking a point), they are extremely tedious to fill, and took much longer than 40 minutes to make!  If I make these again, I will probably use slightly larger tomatoes, because the filling is so good that I think they still would taste great in a bigger tomato.  I just don't feel like spending so much time stuffing them in tiny tomatoes again.  Definitely 5-star worthy on taste though!

I make these for parties and whenever my husband and I crave something to snack on. I use bacon bits instead of regular bacon. It tastes the same and is so much easier. Everyone asks for these time and time again.

These were good, but extremely time consuming to make - I don't know if I would make them again as a filling for the tomatoes, as it took a LONG time to scoop out all the tomatoes, but I would make it as a dip instead.  Thanks for the recipe.

Labor intensive, but delicious. When prepping the tomatoes, use the tip of your knife to cut between the skin and the guts of the tomato. I then used the opposite end of a baby spoon to scoop out the guts. If you don't have babies in the house, any thin metal utensil should do. I changed the mix a bit by combining 1/4 C cream cheese, 1/4 C sour cream, and 2 T of mayo, which put the flavor spot on; it wasn't too oily, but I could still taste the mayo. Very good appetizer!! I also stuffed two larger tomatoes with the filling I had left over, and I gave them to my new neighbors for lunch. Thus, this recipe could easily move from "appetizer" to "lunch."

The flavor was good but the mayo made them pretty oily.  I cut my tomatoes lengthwise and I think it worked a little better.  I agree with another reviewer that cream cheese instead of mayo would probably be better.

You know these are good when someone who doesn't like tomatoes tells you "I hate tomatoes, but I can't stop eating these!".  I used a soy bacon product instead of real bacon (because of the vegetarians in the neighborhood) and they were just as good.  Gone in seconds - thanks!!

This was a very tasty recipe and not as time consuming as I thought it would be. I made them last night for a potluck today and making them so far in advance made the tomatoes a bit mushy. Next time I won't stuff until right before serving.

These babies were a hit as my appetizer for Thanksgiving.  I made them a day ahead and next time I wouldn't stuff them until the day I was serving.  (The tomatoes got a bit "mushy" doing them too early.)  I also used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 cream cheese per all the other reviewer's.  And if you cut the bottoms out of the tomatoes, they will sit quite nicely on a platter without rolling.  I was asked by three relatives for the recipes so you know this one is a keeper!

A LOT of work!  Taste was okay if you ate them right after making.  I made them a few hours ahead of time and when it was serving time, the color of the mixture had changed.  Making it look like something was spoiled.  I won't make again.

OH MY!  I couldnt believe how good these were.  I just made a small batch with some smaller roma tomatoes, and my boyfriend and I loved them!  I did also half the mayo and add some cream cheese.  It makes it thicker and oh so yummier!

I made these for a bridal shower. They were a hit (especially with my 7 year old). It does take time to core the tomatoes, but I think it's different and not an appetizer you see every day. I probably would try the 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream next time. I also cut the bottoms of my tomatoes off so they would not roll around on the tray. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Made for Superbowl party...big hit!  I reduced the amount of mayo and added cream cheese (I like its consistency better).  Also added some crushed croutons as suggested in earlier post...nice touch!

These were a bit hit at the last family party. I added a small bit of chopped croutons to the top as a last minute crunch!

I made this recipe for a holiday party and it got rave reviews.  My husband loved them and so did the other party guests.  I needed something dairy-free for a friend with an allergy and this recipe fit the bill!  I will be making this one again and again!

I am starting with 3 stars because it started out fairly bland. Then I started to add in the items listed in the reviews and it became a 5 star dish.
First hints - definitely cut the bottoms not the tops so they stand better and I let them drain on paper towels upside down for a couple hours before filling. 
I followed the recipe (except I bake my bacon to get it crispier with less mess), then I added in 1/4 cup softened cream cheese and 1/4 cup boursin cheese with Garlic and herbs. That was all it needed to go from bland to wow! I wish I had saved some bacon to sprinkle on top of each one. Also I found they were best at room temperature or slightly cool. Too cold and they seemed fatty. 
Next time I would add less mayo and more green onions.

We've done this several times for large receptions.  Over the years, we've made 2 changes that don't alter the recipe, but seem to help.  Instead of the full mayo amount, we do 1/2 mayo and 1/2 cream cheese.  It cuts the greasy taste some have experienced when using all mayo.  We also use Campari tomatoes (which are a little larger), cut in half and hollowed out.  After fighting with 600 cherry tomatoes, the Campari's are the way to go!

I cut the bottom off the tomatoes instead of the top, so they stand up better.  I've made these many years ago and didn't have the recipe any longer, so I was grateful to find this.  It is a lot of tedious work, but these are so tasty and worth the effort.  I recommend using thin bacon because it makes it easier to stuff the tomatoes.

These were delicious.   I made them for a cookout.  Huge hit.  Everyone was surprise how much the tasted like a BLT.   I used half chive cream cheese and half mayo, minced onion, and lettuce.  Mixed it all in the food processor.  I did salt the tomatoes as recommended by others.  Will make again.

I used six regular size tomatoes instead of the cherry tomatoes and paired it with French bread and potato salad from the store deli. It was delicious and the perfect mid week light dinner.

I really enjoyed this. I had a few tomatoes on my plant to use. Hubby doesn't like tomatoes so I was looking for some way to make them that he would like. Per someone's review, I salted and dried the tomatoes for about 10 minutes first. I used real bacon bits, green onions, mayo (didn't have sour cream or cream cheese), and added some garlic powder and shredded Italian cheese to the mix. Topped it off with crunched up garlic and parmesan croutons as suggested. Super yummy. Will definitely make these again.

Thanks for a wonderful potluck recipe! Have made twice, both times with grape tomatoes since a bit larger and easier to work with. I used the slight variation of substituting garden vegetable cream cheese for half of the mayo. Big hit! Next time I will food process the bacon into a dust to disperse that flavor more evenly and avoid chunks. Maybe the cream cheese made it a bit salty—but I think it was the bacon so I’ll use low sodium bacon next time. A keeper!

I made these two ways. The first was the exact recipe and it was delicious, and the second was with 1/2 mayo and 1/2 veggie cream cheese. I preferred the way with the cream cheese. I found that a 1/4 tsp with a nice edge worked just fine in scooping out the insides. Everyone raved about them so they will definitely become an appetizer staple at my parties!

I made these for a group gathering not long ago and could not believe how much they where liked. I sprinkled a little bit of seasoned bread crumbs over them to get the full BLT experience. Was asked to make them again for today's Super Bowl. Fantastic, simple and impressive.

These were excellent! I did add cream cheese to the mayo mix for a thicker filling. Once I got the deseeding down to a science these weren't that difficult to make at all.  Everything went into my ninja and voila! I will definitely make these again! Thanks for the great recipe!

They must have wiped down the cherry tomatoes after they filled the ones in the picture!!!!  I found that the filling was tasty but VERY messy and I would not make it the same way again.  Next time I will use regular tomatoes and dice them into very small cubes, then add them to the rest of the filling and put the filling on slices of a baguette.

The picture of this recipe is what intrigued me to make these for a family Christmas party. Mine, however, did not look so good:) my tomatoes were not as plump as in the picture so I found cutting them in half then scooping a generous spoon full of filling on top of each half , works really well too. I received numerous compliments on the filling. While making the recipe I realized I did not have green onion so I substituted red onion. Very flavorful.

These were AMAZING! Changed the recipe a little bit due to the reviews. Used 1/2 Mayo and 1/2 cream cheese, sprinkled insides of tomato with salt and let drain. sprinkled with crushed croutons at the end. will definitely make again when tomatoes are in season.

I make this at least every couple of weeks during the summer.  The original recipe that I found several years ago called for a bigger tomato.  I believe they're called cocktail tomatoes.  Bigger than grape tomatoes.  I usually find them at Meijer and sometimes WalMart.   I can't imagine trying to stuff tiny tomatoes.  Plus you're getting the stuffing and not enough of the tomato taste.  The other difference is that the other recipe has grated fresh parmesan cheese.

Great little snack that tastes just like a BLT! I had really long tomatoes so I cut them in half around the equator and cut a tiny bit off of the bottoms so they would sit upright. Like other suggested, I gutted them, salted and flipped upside down to drain. For the filling I used half mayo and half cream cheese since I'm not a huge fan of mayo. Mixed it with some bacon and scallions and filled the tomatoes with a spoon, then topped with a couple more scallions for garnish.

Amazing! The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because I thought they were a bit bland without added seasoning. I sprinkled a ranch packet into the filling mixture and it was PERFECT!

I made these today to bring to my neighbors for a small BBQ.  They were fantastic!!!!  I read the reviews & did the mayo/cream cheese & also added 2 T of grated parm & a dash of garlic powder.  They were to die for.  A bit time consuming yes--  but well worth it.  The recipe has already been forwarded to the guests from the BBQ .  Great appetizer!!  Thanks for the recipe!

very good flavor - I did change the mayonnaise consistency to 1/4 cup- mayonnaise and 1/4 plain yogurt --- which  complimented the bacon.  I, also, had some of the topping left and put it on crackers and everyone liked it better on crackers because it was not watered down by the tomatoes.

Made this for a New Year's Eve party last night.  It was simple to make.  I took some of the other reviewer's suggestions and used half mayo and half cream cheese.  I substituted cilantro for the parsley. (personal preference)  And I cheated with the bacon and used Hormel bacon bits.  They were very good, and were eaten up very quickly.  Thanks for a great appetizer.

My grocery store was out of cherry tomatoes. We ended up with grape. They work pretty well, the only issue is hollowing them out. We cut them in half, to hollow, that worked much better! I have had these a bunch of times at my friends house! I do prefer the cherry over the grape but they tasted the same! I love these, slightly time consuming, but well worth it!

Great flavor. Make sure you get large cherry tomatoes or you will have too much filling and you will be seeding tomatoes all day long. I used my leftover filling in a sandwich with the little tomato bits leftover!

I made with 4 medium vine tomatoes - chopped up the tomato innards which were hollowed out and mixed into the salad.  Made a lovely light lunch - eat it like a very juicy apple or civilized with a fork and knife depending on company... :)  Great for the low carbers

These were a hit over Labor Day weekend.  I didn't have fresh parsley so used a 1/4 cup of finely chopped thai basil instead.  I used low fat mayo and cut the bacon to 3/4lb then trimmed all the fat before frying it up.  A definite keeper!!

I made these last year for fourth of July and forgot to review them.  This year on fourth of July I made something different.... everyone was asking for my baby BLT's.  I think that tells you something about the way they taste.  Takes quite a bit of effort to make though.

I just made these and they are so good.  I also used half garden vegetable cream cheese and half mayo. 
My advice is double the recipe! Because we're eating them as fast as we fill them!

LOVE THESE!  It does take a little time to scoop out the tomatoes.  I used a metal 1/4 tsp scoop to scoop them out, plus I used it to scoop up the filling and stuff the tomatoes with.  I served these to my husband and inlaws....they LOVED it (and my mother-in-law asked for the recipe)!  THANK YOU!  =)

Very tasty. These were for lunch not for appetizers so I used Roma Tomatoes instead of Cherry Tomatoes as someone suggested. Very tasty little side item with lunch. I also added some cream cheese to thicken it up a bit and cut down on the mayonnise flavor.

For taste, 5* - but they are annoying to make.  I was *going* to make recipe as is, then had 2nd thoughts about frying up an entire pound of bacon.  Went to put away my uncooked bacon pack, and lo and behold discovered one (1) lone cooked piece I'd forgotten about.  So I thought what the heck.  Minced bacon, added 1-2 T mayo, 2 green onions and ended up with enough mix to stuff 8 cherry tomatoes - perfect for a quick appetizer for hubby & I.  After only making the 16 of the little buggers (I too cut in half)though, I had a crick in my neck - I can't imagine making an entire batch lol.  Cheers to you who do!

These are sooo good! I didn't have green onions, so subbed 2Tbl minced sweet onion, also did the 1/2 mayo 1/2 cr cheese. They really were a lot of work, but worth it!

What an easy and impressive appetizer! It tastes just like a BLT. I think next time I will use a larer cherry tomato and cut in half instead of cutting the top. Regular cherry tomatoes I think are too small but they still worked! You could ask use on a sandwich as the mayo, put a dollop on sliced tomatoes. Many possabilities!

My family absolutely loves these....No cream cheese though!  They really don't need it.  I make them just as is and serve them on a bed of lettuce.  This helps to keep them upright.  They can be time consuming, but I use a melon baller to fill the tomatoes with and they go fairly quickly.

This was a great appetizer!  I only altered a few things.  First I used cherry tomatoes and because they were so small I sliced them in half and just placed the stuffing on top of the tomatoes.   I also made homemade croutons and crumbled them over the top of the tomatoes, it gave them a great texture!  I made the croutons by heating a little olive oil in a pan (just enough to lightly coat the amount of bread you're using), adding in sliced cubes of really crusty bread, frying until they were golden and crunchy, and lastly I added salt and pepper to taste.

They tasted yummy. The only thing was they just looked dinky sitting on the christmas plate that I used to take to a christmas party. I couldn't figure out how to make them look good on a plate because they are so little looking.

EVERYONE loved these, I used half cream cheese, and half mayonnaise.  filled half of tomatoes with the original recipe, the second half I added crumbled blue cheese, they were equally tasty according to guest.  I will definitely make this again.

yumminess!!! ok so these WERE a pain to scoop, i considered quitting in the very beginning, but after awhile, u get into the groove. using a ziploc bag with cut corner made filling a cinch. i topped with crushed garlic croutons. i think a little less bacon would be sufficient. def use food processer to mince finely.  these disappeared so super fast, i'm afraid they will be requested often LOL!!!

OMGoodness these are amazing!! It took me a little over 2 hours to complete but I made WAY more than 24 of them, it was well worth the time and effort!  I took some of the suggestions and used 1/2 cream cheese and 1/2 mayo. I found mine a bit salty but I think it was the off brand bacon I used. These will definitely become my snack of choice to bring to pot lucks. PS - I used the Magic Bullet to crumble the bacon, worked fantastic!

Delicious. Following other reviews, I salted the inside of the tomatoes and I used about 1/4 c cream cheese, 1/4 mayo, and then just added ranch dressing to it. Didn't use parsley. Topped it with crushed garlic cheddar croutons. I took it to a Christmas party and was a big hit.

These went over very well at the Christmas party this year.  One person even ate about 15 of them!   However, I would have liked another layer of flavor.  I loved the combo of veggies and bacon, but may try what a few others have and use half mayo and half cream cheese (possibly garden vegetable).  I'll look into using real bacon bits too.  If I make these changes, I'll be sure to comment on them, good or bad.

I have been making these for years,  I also add parmesan cheese to the mix. Gives it a little flavor boost. The only problem is, the more you make the more people want. Thats a good thing.

These were good but a little rich. I added lettuce shreds to cut down on thr calories and add bulk.

This is a GREAT recipe! We had a mothers day BBQ and I made a plate of BLT Tomatoes. Everyone loved them, they were gone almost before I put the plate down. They are so easy to make as well. Instead of using cherry tomatoes, I used a little bigger tomatoes and halfed them. It just made it easier to empty and stuff. Very very delicious. Thank you for this recipe

I only can say these are delicious!! followed the recipe to a T, but next time i'm adding in some lettuce, as other reviewer suggested. Made the "Bacon for the family or a crowd" recipe for the bacon, highly recommended!

Yeppers...this one is a KEEPER! These were gobbled up in minutes between 4 people. I will surely have to double it up if I take them somewhere! The great thing, is you COULD (not that I would) make them less fattening by using a ff mayo and some of that low fat microwaveable pre-cooked bacon. Anyway, very tasty, a bit time consuming but worth every moment!

This was awesome!  I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 cream cheese mixture as others suggested and it was wonderful.  I left out the onions and only used less than 1/2 of the suggested 1 pound of bacon, and it still had plenty.  I inadvertently bought grape tomatoes instead of cherry, so I used this as a dip on the side of the tomatoes.  It's a keeper!

These were really good. I used the 1/4 cup cream cheese and 1/4 cup mayo. I used 12 oz. of center cut bacon and it seemed really salty to me. I used a paring knife to cut the top off the cherry tomatoes and then the little membrane down the middle, then scooped. I found that easier then stuffing. I turned them upside down on papertowels over night in the fridge, but they got a little pruny. They were delicious and gone quickly.

If you want to be the hit of your next local BBQ then you better just plan on bringing these right along. I use half mayo and half cream cheese like most others. I don't bother with the fresh parsley because I'm just simply not that fancy.  I've made these a half dozen times now and EVERYONE goes nuts over them.

These were pretty good. Followed suggestions and used half cream cheese. Also hallowed out the tomatoes the night before and let them drain on papertowel in a tuperware in the fridge. Tastey- think I would make again.

These are a hit everywhere I take them.  You have to have patience, it takes time to core/fill the cherry tomatoes, but when you are done, they look great, and taste even better.
Thanks for sharing!

I made these recently for a baby shower and they were a HUGE hit!  Everyone kept asking me where I got the recipe.  The only problem was - I didn't make enough.  Thank you for such a great recipe and for helping make the shower a great success!

These are very tasty! I used small roma tomatoes as they are not so juicy as other said. They worked perfect, but of course because they are a bigger tomato this recipe only made 8. Igave this recipe 4 stars because it is labor intense, but definitely a keeper.

I was looking for something exciting and new to serve at my New Year's Eve party this year. I wanted to put a new twist on this recipe that I haven't seen from anyone else. My plan is to use 1/4 cup jalepeno cream cheese and 1/4 cup sour cream (to replace mayo), chives (in place of green onions), 1/4 lb real bacon bits, and a paremsan/mozzarella mix. I think the jalepeno will give it that extra zip. I think I will serve on toothpicks stuck into something solid to keep them standing upright. I am calling these tomato poppers and will let you know how they go over!

This is a real party pleaser. At the recommendation of others I made a few changes. Instead of 1/2 cup of mayonnaise, I use 1/4 cup cream cheese & 1/4 mayonnaise.They are less greasy this way. I also add 2Tbs of grated parmesan cheese to the mixture. Once you serve these your friends will want the recipe.

This are absolutely delicious! Took another's suggestion and used 1/4 C mayo, 1/4 C veggie cream cheese. Turned out great! I am putting left over mixture on crackers, so it also works great as a dip.

I've had these little babies a couple of times now and they're a definate hit at any party or gathering!!!! I am planning on making a batch of these on my own, but I'm a spicy kind of guy and i'm looking for suggestions on how to kick these babies up a notch>> I'm thinking something like horseradish, red pepper blend, chopped halapenos, etc..... I would like to know if anyone has attempted this yet and what did you use ??? Thanks in advance

YUM!  Use half mayo/half whipped cream cheese.  Also, I used my serrated edge grapefruit spoon to hollow out the tomatoes and it worked great. The reviewers who suggested putting the tomatoes on a paper towel lined pan first and filling later were brilliant.  This solves the "soggy" problem.

These were a huge hit at our Memorial Day cookout.  EVERYONE asked for the recipe. I used half mayo and half cream cheese and left out the parsley.  Pain to make but worth it.  My brother-in-law liked them so much he's made them twice already since the cookout.

I made these little bites for a Memorial Day picnic, and they were the first thing gone.  They literally disappeared!  Per other reviewers suggestions, I did half mayo and half cream cheese.  I also sprinkled crushed croutons on top.  It does take a little time to assemble - using a zip top bag to pipe in filing helps.  I had a few tomatoes that fell apart when I was scooping them out, but after letting the filling set in the tomatoes for a couple of hours they looked fine and were easy to handle.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were great.  I added a little fresh grated parmesan to the mix too for a twist.  I've seen a recipe with these baked after stuffing them and I don't recommend it unless you like warm tomatoes.  Chilled in the fridge tasted much better and the tomatoes had a nice tomoato-ey crunch.

Got this recipe from a friend who made them for a party and have since made it myself a few times.  A little time consuming but the result is well worth it. Very very tasty and always a hit.

Very delicious!  I used just mayo and definately recommend cutting it in half with cream cheese.  I use the whipped variety to cut fat and lighten taste.

I took these little jewels to an international ladies meeting this morning in Seoul, South Korea and they were a hit.  I had so many requests for recipes that we decided I'd just make copies to bring to our next meeting.

Based on other reviews, I used pre-cooked bacon bit, about 1 1/2 oz. (will probably use only 1 oz. next time) and used 1 txp. dried parsley in lieu of fresh.  Thanks to PEGNMIL for her thoughts on adding some cheese.  I cut the mayo back to 1/4 c. and added 1/4 c. shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  It was time consuming, though, so when I felt I could not stuff another tomato, I decided to chop the remaining tomatoes (after removing the pulp) and add that to the filling.  I think it will make for a great sandwich spread tomorrow.  I may even add some pimento...yum.  Thanks Angela!

These werent as time consuming as I'd thought, but the next time I make them, I'll definitely use pre-cooked bacon, as I thought there was too much bacon for my liking anyway.

Takes a little time, but well worth it. Just make sure the cherry tomatoes aren't too small. These are always the first to go at potlucks. I have made these a number of times and ALWAYS get asked for the recipe.

Way to much green onion but would be really good with 1/2 the onion.  I probably will make again...

I was expecting more from these yummy-sounding appetizers, and was disappointed. They are labor-intensive for not-so-fantastic taste. I mixed cream cheese and sourcream instead of the mayo, used fresh chives, and crisp turkey bacon. The kids at my brunch loved them, the adults could have lived without them. Won't make again.

I made these as an appetizer with our Easter lunch & they were wonderful!!  I'm a HUGE bacon lover & they are just the perfect blend to actually taste like a BLT!  Also, I had several people that hate tomatoes tell me they were really good!  Yum!

These are extrememly tasty. The second time I made these I substituted the mayonnaise for Miracle Whip and found it to be even tastier. I think I'll try using slightly bigger tomatoes next time so there are less to hull. I found that hulling them all and having to fry a whole pound of bacon takes a bit longer than I like.

A crowd-pleaser!  I used a bottle of real bacon pieces to save time and I don't think it affected the taste at all.  The beautiful red color looks great set out on a buffet table.

I give this recipe 5 stars for flavor, but only 4 stars for presentation, as I thought the mayo mixture was a little too runny.  I even added a small amount of cream cheese with chives and some sour cream that I had in the fridge.  As another reviewer suggested, I think more cream cheese would be key to a firmer consistency.  They were a little messy, but definitely worth the effort - wonderful flavor!  I will be making these again!

I made these for a Christmas luncheon and they were a hit.  I used a mixture of cream cheese and sour cream when I discovered someone put an empty jar of mayo in the fridge.  they still tasted great.  I added a bit of Italian dip seasoning for kick.  It took me about 4o minutes to make 30 from start to finish.  I used a tomoto corer to scoop out the tomatos and as another reviewer suggested sprinkled a little salt and turned them upside down to let the excess juice run out.  This is a fun recipe!

Takes time, but well worth the effort. They are colorful, festive, and quite tasty. Disappear in minutes. Serve on a platter surrounded by crackers. I also recommend adding chopped celery, grated mozzarella cheese, and sprinkling with paprika.

Yummy!!!  Pretty time consuming, but my husband liked them so much that he helped me gut the tomatoes.  I doubled the recipe for a party and every last one of them went.  It was for a hot summertime party and it was a good appetizer for the summer.  I'll definetly make them again.

These were very well recieved when I brought them to a wedding party.  Withholding a star because I would like more flavor from them.  Maybe if I make them again I will mix ranch dressing mix with the mayo.
