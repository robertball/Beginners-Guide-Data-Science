YUUUMMMMYYY!  I took in all the reviews and this is what I came up with.  I started off with 12 pieces country white bread and cut off the crusts(I tend not to like the crust) then cubed and mixed with melted butter and 11/2tbsp cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg for better flavor. I skipped the raisins because I didn't want in my dish but you could add diced apples as well.(if you do add raisins I would soak for 8min in boiling water or apples in the melted butter to soften) For the milk I did- 1 1/2 cup milk and 1 1/2 cup heavy cream for a richer flavor.  I followed the rest and I did use a 2quart baking dish but I rested it in a 13X9 inch dish filled 1/3 with warm water to bake (read it makes a a little more custard like opposed to mushy).  I baked for like 40-45 minutes to let the top get that little crunch.   Out of the oven I ate a third-it was so good!  the rest of the family finished it off.  Will have to make again real soon!

This bread pudding *really is* a winner! I had never made bread pudding before but spent time reading all the many reviews and revised the recipe accordingly. I cut the crusts off 12 slices white bread and then cut each slice into 16 squares. I used butter instead of margarine, which I melted and blended with the liquid ingredients rather than the dry bread cubes. I softened the raisins by briefly soaking them in boiling water (about 10 min.) I tossed the bread and raisins together with 1 TABLESPOON ground cinnamon (could probably have used 2 tablespoons, even!)I topped the pudding with 3 pinches of nutmeg, also as suggested. The 6 eggs were just fine to use, next time I may use 1/2 milk and 1/2 light cream and maybe a tablespoon of rum or cognac. Baking temperature of 375 degrees F was OK but as I used a 2 quart Pyrex casserole dish measuring 9" top diameter, 7" bottom diameter and 3" deep and set the casserole dish into a 9" x 13" x 2" metal baking pan filled with water, baking time was more like an hour to an hour and a half. Nevertheless, my very BRITISH boyfriend nearly shrieked with delight when he arrived home to find this bread pudding in the works. However, according to him, this would be classified as Bread & Butter Pudding. Who cares? He snarfed it down au naturel without any embellishments and was licking his eyebrows afterwards. Mission Accomplished!

This is a really good, basic bread pudding and pure comfort food.  I tend to like my bread pudding more custard-like, rather than squishy, like this one.  However, if you like your bread puddings custardy, like me, just bake this one in a water bath for a super yummy treat on a cold night!

This has a great flavor.  I should have read the reviews and used one less egg, as this bread pudding was too "custardy" for me.  But the rest of the family loved it.  I used 3 1/2 cups of cubed baguette, which is more dense than some white breads and makes a firmer pudding.  I will make it again, thanks!

Delicious!!!!!!    When it's just coming out of the oven you may wonder why it's so fluffy but don't be alarmed- it collapses a bit as it cools off.  My husband ate the ENTIRE dish in 2 days!  And he wonders why he is too fluffy?  :)

Great recipe!  This is a classic dessert that is so easy and so good!  I used on full cup of raisins and instead of mixing the cinnamon in with the bread, I added it to the egg mixture (1 Tbsp.) Along with the eggs and salt, I used 1 cup of sugar, 1 Tbsp. of vanilla, 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg, 1 cup of light cream and 2 cups of half and half.  This baked up beautifully and I served it topped with "Bourbon Whipped Cream" from this site.

I had a baguette (possibly whole-wheat, from Panera) that was getting hard, and I thought bread pudding would be the perfect way to take care of it. Because I wasn't using white bread that came in slices, I couldn't follow the recipe exactly. I cut the bread into slices and then cubes, giving me maybe 3 cups (I have no idea, just guessing). I did the rest basically by eye, though I did use exactly 3 cups of milk and 5 eggs (reviewers said 6 was a bit much). When I tipped the dish after 25 mins, liquid still escaped, so I baked it for an extra 10 minutes.  It tastes very good! I've never made bread pudding before, and this was super-easy.

Ohhh YUMMMMMMY. A total hit with my family. I made it with fresh baked bread. I made the mistake of topping the prebaked mixture with extra raisins before popping into the oven. Don't do that. The ones on top got too cooked. But that was my own fault. Lesson Learned. :) Anyway, WOW! As great as I had hoped and anticipated, a fantastic, cozy treat on an Autumn morn. Could not get much easier than this. I can't wait to teach my kids to make this. PERFECT! EASY!!!!! Make this for your family and they will forever love you. :)

Outstanding!  Not too eggy, not too dry.  This was really tasty stuff.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  The leftovers make a great breakfast (although, not too healthy).  Thanks for sharing!

Taken to a company pot-luck for something "different". Turned out SUPERB! Many, many compliments on the wonderful texture and taste. I used 5 med eggs, and plain ole' white sandwich bread. Easy and delicious. Added to the family holiday menu for certain!

Loved this one! Followed the recipe as is, except toasted country white bread and used evaporated milk equal portioned with water. Could not find a recipe for vanilla sauce as others had recommended, however I used the sauce to Gramma's apple bread pudding which is on this site. Thanks for the best bread pudding ever.........

This was fantastic! I used dried cranberries instead of raisins just because I had them on hand but that doesn't really count as a change to the recipe does it?

I made this for my boyfriend for Father's Day because he had been asking for bread pudding for a while.  Since I had never made it, I was looking for a simple recipe.  My mom and grandmother both make bread pudding but of course couldn't tell me the measurements for any of the ingredients!  This was fantastic!!!  My boyfriend loved it!  Following some of the other reviews (and at the advice of my Granny), I used one less egg than what the recipe called for.  I also used a little more sugar and no raisins (he didn't want them). I think I baked it a little longer too, more like 45 or 50 minutes and the texture was perfect.  Will definitely be making again!  P.S.  I  made a vanilla sauce from powdered sugar and can milk (don't have the amounts; just used enough to get it to the sweetness and thickness that I wanted).  Brought that to a boil and let simmer to get a little thicker and added a teaspoon of vanilla.  Spread this on top of the bread pudding and it was out of this world (try it warmed with french vanilla ice cream on top)!

This was delicious! I brought it for my co-workers b-day and it was a hit. I made a few changes though. I used texas toast instead of regular white bread. I also used large raisins from the bulk section of the grocery store. They plumped up nicely. Also, I had to cook it for about 35 minutes more than it called for. Plus, I made a the sauce (icing)from the "Bread Pudding" recipe on allrecipes to pour over it. This really added to the flavor. Delicious!!
I definitely will make this again.

I have become the bread pudding expert.  This is very good.  I added walnuts and a sauce to add before serving.  However, this recipe is also under Bread Pudding III and Bread Pudding III does not have the soaking the bread 5 minutes before putting in oven.  This is important.

This is a great base for bread pudding.  I did make a few changes however.  I used a loaf of iced raisin bread, 1/2 cup butter, 8 eggs, 1cup sugar, and 2 1/2  cups flavored creamer instead of milk.  (along with the other listed ingedients) Once everything was mixed together i sprinkled 1/2 cup white chocolate chips on top.  Let it bake for 45 minutes and voila...a perfect bread pudding!

This recipe was great, I made it for my book club and they all just thought it was a very cozy dessert.  I did make a few changes though, I did the recipe for 12 servings.  I used a whole loaf (1 pound) of white texas toast, I cut half the crusts off and left half the crusts.  I only put in the bread, raisins (which I softened in boiling water for about 10 min), and the cinnamon in a large bowl and mixed together.  I put the butter in with the liquid ingrediants.  I put 2 1/2 cups of milk and 2 cups of 1/2 n 1/2, and stuck to the rest of the recipe and 9 eggs were just perfect.  I did have to cook it for about 55 min at 375.  And I put it in a 3 quart baking dish which was perfect.  It got really fluffy but when it was taken out it settled.  Definetly will make again, will go great with the upcoming holidays.

this was awesome! Bread pudding has always been my favorite.  I followed the suggestions in some of the previous reviews and only used 5 eggs.  Once it was cooled I added a layer of meringue on top and popped it back in the oven to brown.  I also made a very light vanilla sauce (1/2 cup sugar, 1 cup water, 1/4 cup butter, 2 tsps vanilla, and 1 tsp cornstarch) which I very lightly drizzed over each serving.  My husband and kids have never had bread pudding before and absolutely loved it. It was the first time I have ever made bread pudding, it was super easy and tasted just like the stuff I grew up with.

I had a gallon of milk just turning, an abundance of farm fresh eggs, a loaf of stale sour dough French bread because the bag ripped and decided to make bread pudding.  DH has never had it before so I told him it tastes like French bread and he salivated.  I used Splenda instead of sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp rum flavoring for more of an eggnog taste, 1/4 cup raisins, 1/3 cup chopped dried apples and was generous with the cinnamon.  I baked it in a glass, deep dish pie plate for 55 minutes until it tested done.  Serve with pure maple syrup.  Puffs up beautifully and will make again.  Yum!

i found The bread pudding recipe- you don't mess with something like this. (the only thing i changed was 5 eggs instead of six, & i didnt have nutmeg, so i put the tiniest amount of ground cloves on top, and i added almond extract to the egg mixture.) I had a small amount of toffee bits,& threw them in too. I made the brown sugar sauce by brenda moore from this website, and voila! Good enough for special guests, but you'll want to keep it for yourself.

I made this recipe last weekend for the family including my brother and his wife and everyone loved it. My brother even went so far as to tell me it's the best dessert I made yet. I finished it off with vanilla sauce and a heaping tablespoon of cool whip with a sprinking of confectionary sugar! Yummy and sinful!!!!! I will definitely make this easy dessert over and over again.

This was my first time making Bread Pudding, and it turned out GREAT!  I had some French rolls that were going to waste and thought I'd search the net for a bread pudding recipe.  I had no idea how easy it would be to make (and I don't love baking).  I've been telling everyone about it, and I'll be making another one very soon!

this recipe was not only easy but totally delicious! i followed advice from other reviews and set it in the oven in a water bath. worked great! just be sure to keep an eye on the cooking type. the first time i made it, it took 1 hr to completely cook. the next time i made it, it took about 45 min. i dont know why but either way it was delicious.

This was good but I made a few changes to try and match some I had eaten before and loved so much. I used 12-14 slices of light calorie day old sandwish bread, added 1 tps. almond extract to the egg mixture, only used 5 eggs instead of 6 and in place of one of the cups of milk used a can of Eagle Brand condensed milk instead to make it more creamy and rich. I also used fat free milk since that is all I had at the time. I used a round deep baking dish and had a little trouble getting it done enough in the center so had to increase baking time by about 25-30 minutes. When it was finally done it was great and my family ate the whole thing in one sitting. To me it was sweet enough by itself and didn't need any icecream or sauce to go with it but I'm sure that would be good also.

Great recipe though Iwould leave out the raisins as mine all ended up at the bottom and I also had to cook mine way longer than the recipe called for.  But over all good bread pudding.

I caught my husband out in the kitchen sneaking MORE of this bread pudding! He absolutely LOVES it! He said "It's SO GOOD..I could just sit down and eat this whole thing!!" Bread Pudding was a favorite of my husband's since he was little..a friend's mom used to make it for him. I have been searching off and on for many years for a recipe that would be exactly like the one he remembered and this one was it! My 2 boys wouldn't try it but my 4 girls did and they thought it was pretty good too. I had never tried anyone else's bread pudding or even heard of it before I met my husband. It has a mushy texture to it, to me anyway, but the flavor is wonderful. It's the best one I've made yet! I did add an extra 1/2 cup of raisins and I might even add more than that next time. I will be making this again. Thanks!

Very good! I made recipe as written. I like my bread pudding soft and custardy. I do not like it firm and dry or real solid. This was close to another recipe I make.This was in between. I'm used to it a little sweeter so I made a homemade caramel sauce to top it. It was enjoyable on this cold winter night.Thanks Nancy!

I made this a few weeks ago for some surprise dinner guests ( I didn't have anything for dessert) and it turned out very well. I didn't make any alterations or substitutions, and the end result was a very moist, delicious bread pudding.  I served this with a brown sugar sauce from this site and a dollop of vanilla ice cream. My guests really enjoyed this, and my husband who dilikes any dessert that does not have chocolate in it, had two servings.

Way to go Nancy!  My wife loves bread pudding and she raved over it. She's such a picky person, too!  I added 50% to the recipe to make in a 3 qt. dish, and it came out perfect!  Good recipe for someone who's just starting to try to cook new things.

Great dessert. I really liked the texture of it. I also used craisins instead of raisins. The reason I gave four stars rather than five is because I thought it was too sweet. Would definitely cut down the sugar next time.

i worked at a child care center as a cook when i first came across this recipe.  we had quite a bit of bread that needed to be used and i thought this was the perfect way to use it.  it was something different for the kids and contained all the components required by the state for "snack".  the kids raved about it and wanted more!

Hell yeah! This was yummy! I just got through making this. My changes:
I used half milk and half heavy cream (and forgot to warm it), 6 medium eggs, 1 cup of sugar, and used a water bath. I did soak the raisins in warm whiskey prior to adding them in. I also made a whiskey sauce of 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/2 cup honey whiskey, 1/2 heavy cream, 1/4 cup of corn syrup, 1/4 tsp salt and cornstarch to thicken. Yummy!!!

Bread pudding is a great way to add cheap nutrition to your meals. Your imagination is your only limitation.  Last night I made bread pudding with thinly sliced very ripe bananas and chocolate chips. Delicious!!

Great taste.  Great texture.  Here are some additional details:  Used 5 eggs as other reviewers said.  Used Safeway french bread. Bought the bread on a Thursday and prepared the dish on a Saturday morning.  Cut some of the harder crust off and left some of the softer crust on.  I added slightly more cinnamon, and had to cook about 45 minutes so it wasn't too gooey.  The dish was awesome!

I just made this recipe and it was a hit, very simple.  I used stale cinnamon bread I had in the freezer. I used skim milk and Splenda. I didn't think the skim milk would work but it did.  I then used the Rum sauce and poured over the top with whip cream... SWEEEEEEET and oh so good...

I did cook this in a water bath so that I could get the custardy-texture. I put the mixture in a 2qt round baking dish and then set that inside of a 3qt rectangular baking dish filled with water. The hubbie and I LOVED it. I used golden raisons from the natural foods aisle and they didn't need any softening. I also prepared a vanilla sauce with a little bit of Meyers Rum in it to serve along with the bread pudding. FABulous!

Great! I've tried a few bread puddings from this site, and I liked them all, but one was a bit dry, and one a bit gooey. This was the perfect balance.

This is the most delicious bread pudding I have ever made.  I made a vanilla sauce to top it off.
This is wonderful.

This was a very quick and easy recipe to make.  The kids loved helping.  I used a loaf of vanilla pound cake instead of bread and it came out great.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this today and it was fabulous  I used a loaf of very stale wheat French bread.  I was concerned because the bread was so hard it was difficult to cut into chunks.  I made the following adjustments.  1. 5 eggs in lieu of 6 as reviewers suggested.  
2. 2 cups fat free evaporated milk and 1 cup water.
3. Splenda in lieu of sugar
4. Semi sweet chocolate chips instead of raisins. 

I made a caramel bourbon sauce to serve over it. Because the bread was so hard I let it sit for about 15 minutes before baking. It was perfect! I like dense bread pudding and this was just to my liking.  Will definitely make again. Next time I may add a bit more Splenda.

THIS RECIPE IS FABULOUS.  I MAKE IT SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR BEGINNING IN THE FALL. I FOLLOW THE RECIPE BECAUSE IT IS EXCEPTIONAL.  AFTER I MADE IT A COUPLE TIMES I DID MAKE ONE ALTERATION.  I USE CINNAMON RAISIN SWIRL BREAD.  THE TEXTURE OF THE BREAD IS GREAT.  I STILL MAKE IT WITH WHITE BREAD IF I DON'T HAVE THE OTHER. I GIVE IT 10 STARS.

This was my very first time making bread pudding and my roommate and I just loved it!! The only change I made to the recipe was that I used whole wheat sandwich slices of bread instead of white bread. We ate ours still warm out of the oven with a scoop of french vanilla ice cream on the side. Delicious!!

WOOOWWWW!!! I never review any recipe, but this was by far the best Bread Pudding recipe EVER! My mom had the best Bread Pudding but unfortunately she never shared it before she passed away.  I used raisin cinnamon bread instead of the white and I used a sugar subsitute and it still turned out delicious, it's really close to Mom's.

I have tried numerous Bread Pudding recipes but found this one super easy and perfect every time.  I searched for a rum sauce recipe that was like my mother in laws but finally found that my husband prefers warm cooked vanilla pudding drizzled on top and you could add a dash of rum extract if you like.  Worth a try if you like old fashioned bread pudding

I have made this twice.  I used skim milk since that is what we drink in our home.  Other than that followed the recipe exactly the first time.  I did it in a water bath and baked 45 minutes.  My husband and I really enjoyed it but decided it could use more cinnamon.  My little boy hates raisins so the next time I used peeled apples and doubled the cinnamon.  I did not precook the apples but they only turned out a little crunchy.  The next time I may use the apples again but add some nuts and either whole milk or half milk and half cream.  My son is home for spring break so it is a good time to try anything new.  The only trouble I have is keeping the fruit from falling to the bottom.  Any suggestions?

Ive tried this recipe once before and did it exact, and found that it was a bit bland. So this time i twisted it around and put chunks of granny smith apples, and i cut back the milk to 2 1/2 cups and i added alot more cinnamon (its a favorite flavor in this house). And after baking it I also sprinkled on some brown sugar to the top, it came out PERFECT and wonderful!

This was really tasty. I'm not sure what I expected when I did this but I kept my fingers crossed when I made this. As reccommended I used  five eggs. I also used 1 cup of sugar and about 3 and 1/4 cup milk.I added a pinch of nutmeg when combining the sugar, milk and vanilla extract. It did not need a sauce to make it better. It was great as is.

I like this recipe! It's simple and basic but tastes so good. Because it's so simple like a good old chiffon cake, you can dress it up anyway you like. Personally I like vanilla sauce but if I can incorporate Bailey's into this amazing little dessert it sounds good too.  For those who want a sauce to go with it but don't have any recipes (ironically haha) or those who really really want to eat the pudding as soon as possible, try melting some vanilla or rum&raisin ice cream in the microwave and then pouring it all over the pudding. The cafe I used to work at does this all the time.

Excellent! A water bath is NOT needed to make this recipe, as others are suggesting. The baking time is a bit off, as it took mine 55 minutes to fully set in my 2 quart Pyrex dish. I used an entire small loaf of Pepperidge Farm's Cinnamon raisin bread, 1/3 cup raisins, butter, and only 5 eggs - following the directions as listed. Also, I used cold milk and omitted the nutmeg. Used melted vanilla ice cream as a sauce and it was a hit! So easy and delicious!

Great! I used really dry french bread, so I let it soak a little longer than called for. other than that, followed the recipe exactly. I didn't bother with the water bath (too lazy ;-)) but the consistency was perfect. Some bread puddings are too runny and mushy, but this one with custardy and delish!

I love this recipe.  Very basic & very easy.  I use sweet italian bread or Hawaiian sweet rolls and a little more cinnamon.  I also use golden raisin & either dried cherries or cranberries.

I put the butter on the bread and then cut it into cubes. I also have done this in my crock pot. Make sure to spray the crock pot with pam. I cook it on high for one hour and lower the temp. for 2 hours...works great in the summer when I don't want to turn on the oven.

I made this recipe for one of my best friends, she "melted" right before my eyes.  She said this was the best bread pudding she had ever tasted.  I made it a second time with a few extra goodies.  Before I put it in the oven, I added 2 heaping handfuls of milk chocolate chips, 2 handfuls of white chocolate chips, and 1 1/2 handfuls of chopped pecans.  I had to "mop" my friend off the floor.  WONDERFUL!!!

I have made this several times and it turns out great.  I also used one less egg so that it wouldn't taste like egg so much.  I added more cinnamon and more raisins also.  This is great for all times of the year.

Well, I'm one more to give it 5 stars! My partner said she couldn't think of anything that would improve it! I didn't put in any raisins because I used raisin bread. Because of other reviews, I used 5 eggs and that was plenty. Will definately make again!

I have made this many times and never changed a thing, except for the size of dish(do mine in individual dishes) and that I mix the butter in with the other "wet" ingredients. It's always turned out PERFECTLY. Sometimes I mix up everything and put them in the dishes just before company arrives, and they sit on the counter for awhile (an hour or more) and then I pop them in the oven just as we sit down for dinner and they still turn out amazing. I do make the vanilla sauce that appears in the grandma's apple pudding recipe and that always works for me too. I drizzle a little of that on top just before serving.

Great recipe Nancy!! I had lost the one that I had used and printed this one off as a substitute. Hey if I find the old one I'll chuck it and keep this one!!! This was delicious and lasted only thru the next day with just the 2 of us. A very basic recipe but easy to fix and with just the right amount of cinnamon/vanilla & sugar. We loved it.

Wow, this was really good. It was very close to my grandmother's bread pudding. I found this to be very simple and fast to make. Only change was I substituted Splenda for sugar. It was great. Thanks!

Awesome Bread Pudding!  I did not change a thing.  It was moist and delicious, most of my raisins were at the bottom and formed a kind of sugary sauce.  It was super moist!  I used the soft italian bread from the grocery store.  Cubed about half of the loaf and dried it a bit in the oven as it preheated.   Yummy!

We loved this recipe....I omitted the raisins (yuk) and added a large chopped apple.  I did fix a simple rum sauce to pour over.

This was wonderful.  My husband said it was better than his mother's bread pudding, and he thought hers was great.  I used all the eggs as we like the custard taste. Thanks for sharing.

When I started out to make the bread pudding, I thought I would be the only one eating it since no one in my family is a bread pudding fan.  Surprisingly, my sister ate some (she does not like bread pudding at all) and she loved it!!!!  Like one user said, I will leave out one egg next time I make it.  It tasted a bit too eggy for me.  But, overall, it was delicious!!!!

This was a great recipe - it was fast and easy. Losing the raisins didn't hurt either since I'm not a raisin fan. I served it warm with vanilla bean ice cream and we all loved it. I like my bread pudding a little thicker and less soupy, so I cooked it a little longer and liked the consistency better too... to each his/her own, I say! This was great altogether! Thanks Nancy!

I followed this recipe to the T!!! I didn't and would not change anything about it. It is a tasty dessert that is quick to make!
I love the texture, it's the perfect combo! Not too creamy and thick enough to hold when slicing. The amount of sugar, cinnamon and raisins I think was perfect for the taste......just the right amount of sweet! I have made this 3 times during this Christmas holiday because it is just that easy to make. Everyone loved it and couldn't believe I baked it, they were impressed (I'm hardly the baker in the family). If they only knew how easy it was. I'm so happy I found this recipe!!

I've been eating bread pudding since I was a young girl.  My mom has been making it for years, she hasn't for a while and forgot her own recipe.  
I looked this up and she tried it with a day old homemade bread, she usually used store bought bread.  The bread was perfect!!!  She never used nutmeg and we wondered how it would be.  It was HEAVENLY!!!  
We topped it with her own lemon sauce which is how we always had it, and it was perfect.  
Thank you for such a lovely recipe

I use this recipe all the time and love it, and so does everyone else that I fix it for.  However, I do cut back on the bread to 8 slices and find that the pudding is more moist and more cutard-like, which we enjoy.  The more bread used, the drier the pudding will be.  I just make sure that I test the pudding with a clean knife in the center to make sure it is baked long enough (the knife should come out clean when done).  I sometimes change the raisins for "craisins", which is also awesome.  This last time, instead of raisins, I put in about 3/4 cup of fresh, washed & dried, blueberries - absolute fantastic.  This basic recipe is the best, and then just have fun with it and make it your own.

I would say this was a good recipe but definitely not great.  When I rate I try to make the recipe exactly as written.  The cooking time was way off for me, 25-30 minutes the product was still wetter than I like so I ended up baking 45 minutes.  This was more like a french toast type dish than bread pudding.  I plumped the raisins beforehand as I like the softer texture.  The sweetness level was okay to my taste but did get one comment it was not sweet enough(a sugar nut).  After the first taste I did make a butterscotch like sauce and everybody agreed that was a nice addition(was how my grandmother served bread pudding).  It was way to eggy for me and maybe those who cut back by one egg would have a better result(I HATE eggs).  I won't be making this one again.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I ended up baking it for about 40-45 minutes, testing it every five minutes past the 30 minute mark.  It puffed up and turned golden brown.  Yum!

I made this using some cinnamon raisin bread (which was pretty dried out) and would probably make it again using white bread.  I forgot to add the nutmeg but I still thought it tasted pretty good.  I did cook it longer than was called for in the recipe.

Awesome!  If you like bread pudding, this is a super on to try.  The touch of ground nutmeg, makes it!  Be sure to use a hearty bread, not a regular sliced white sandwich type.  I tried both, and the french was hands down BETTER!  Gotta serve a la mode.  Bryers vanilla bean was perfect!  French would be good too.

I halved the recipe and used a square dish. I found the result a bit eggy... I suggest soaking it longer than five minutes, and next time I will use a water bath as some had suggested. I did add raisin, craisins, 1 chopped apple and some chopped peacans.

i was hoping that it would be more custardy but it ended up more eggy both times i made it.  besides that, it had a great flavour but lacked the "custardyness" i was looking for, perhaps that is just a personal preference.

I used the leftover egg nog my husband made the night before (has some rum in it) as the "milk". Added chopped figs and walnuts stuffed dates that were leftover as well instead of raisins. All guests left with the recipe!

I made this recipe for Christmas dinner dessert, and it was fantastic! The changes I made are as follows: I used 6 butter croissants pulled into chunks. I also used 1/3 c. of condensed milk, 2/3 c. egg nog, and the remaining 2 c. of milk, all heated. This made an amazing bread pudding! For a sauce, I used 1/2 c. water, 3/4 packed brown sugar, 1/4 c. margarine, with 2/3 c. condensed milk, and half cup chocolate chips. All boiled and melted until thick. Super dessert!

Love this recipe and everyone who tries it does too! I used 2C horchata and 1 C half and half, and added diced sauteed apples (in butter, cinnamon, brown sugar) and chopped pecans, and it was heavenly! Am going to use cranberries for Thanksgiving!

This was SUPER YUM! We used cranberries because it is what I had, but all in all, it was really good. Great with cow's milk or soy milk drizzled on top of it in your dish while it's still warm. Really very easy too. Thanks!

Loved this!  I needed a quick, easy dessert and this was perfect--reminded me of the bread pudding my mom made me when I was a child.

Mine not have cooked long enough (it baked for over an hour, but my oven's slow), but it still came out very tasty, though of a weird consistency (like gelatin).  I incorporated reviewers' suggestions, like more cinnamon.

I followed recipe but left out raisins.  It was good and easy but didn't really get rave reviews from family and friends.  Probably will try other recipes before making this again.

This was excellent and super easy.  I used 5 eggs instead of 6 and used a french loaf that was a day old, since I had it around.  I served this with the caramel sauce from another recipe on this site:  Peachy Bread Pudding with Caramel Sauce.  This is a keeper I will make again!

This is a wonderful recipe and of course I modified. I added cut and peeled two apples, a pear and cranraisens instead of raisens. And more spices- nutmeg,alspice,gound cloves,cinnamon. I then added a lemon drissle. So I guess I got an all frills bread pudding that everyone raved about at Thanksgiving

One word...YUM.  Delicious.  Used a whiskey sauce found on another site, one loaf of cinnamon raisin bread from the discount store (omitted the cinn. and raisins from recipe).  Super easy, and VERY GOOD.  Too good, actually.  And I love bread pudding.

I just made this recipe and it is delicious!  Good thing I listened to other reviewers though, it took about an hour before the knife came out clean...I followed the recipe exactly and the only thing I did different was sprinkle a little more cinnamon on top before baking.  Very tasty and the next time I will try a carmel or a whisky sauce just to try something new.  But this ones definitely a keeper and easy.  What a way to use up old bread!

This bread pudding was delicious.  I made it for my husband and he loved it.  I would recommend using one less egg though because i could taste the egg in it a little big.  Outstanding recipe.

What I did was use up any older bread that was in the fridge--hotdog buns, wheat bread, sweet rolls, white bread. I toasted them up in the pan to remove some moisture before I soaked them in the milk/egg mixture. When it seemed watery, I just added more bread until it had spongelike consistency. I used one less egg like others suggested and added some leftover chopped strawberries. I baked it in an 8x8 pyrex which i think is wrong.It was too thick. The top and sides got bread-like in consistency while the middle seemed more like custard at 35 minutes. What I'll do next time is to use a wider,longer pan so that everything will bake firmly and not custardlike and adjust the bake time accordingly. I think it will come out great then.

I baked this bread pudding after reading the reviews, and was afraid it would be too much like french toast. I was right, and after I cut the eggs and added sugar, it still just tasted like french toast. My boyfriend's mother said she liked it, but I thought it was bland.

I had a Wonderful bread pudding recipe that got lost in a move several yrs back.  Since then I have been searching for a new one that tasted as good as my old favorite. This one is not quite as good but...  it was really good! I followed the recipe with the exception of 5 eggs instead of 6.  While I mad the egg mixture I put the bread cubes in the oven to dry them just a bit...  Then I used crainraisins instead and increased the amount to 1/2 cup instead of 1/4 cup. I soaked them in hot water for about 5 mins before adding them.  I also thought why not add apples...  So I added 1/2 cup pealed & diced apple. I added just a dab more cinnamon and then sprinkled a cinnamon & sugar mixture on top.  I made the vanilla sauce from Gramma's apple bread pudding recipe for the top. My husband is not a big fan of bread pudding but he really liked this one! I think next time I will only use 4 eggs as it was still too "eggy" for me.  I would love to find a white sauce for the top because that would be better then the vanilla sauce from this site.  Over all it was pretty good and simple to make.

I made a few changes, but this is the best bread pudding I've tried!  Since I prefer my bread pudding more like mushy bread (like a form of French bread), I only used 5 eggs per many reviewers.  I also used 1 TBS of cinnamon.  I didn't add any raisins because I used a wonderful bread from the bakery with dates, raisins and nuts.  I also guessed on the bread and might've added a slice too many, but it was still quite good.  I forgot the nutmeg and to let it sit for five minutes before putting it in the oven.  Yup, still good!  This is a simple and delicious recipe.  If you are going to add a sauce though, you might want to cut back on the sugar in the pudding at it is already plenty sweet enough.

This recipe makes very good basic bread pudding. I followed the recipe exactly, using homemade crustless bread. The cooking time was a bit over an hour.  It is almost light (not too dense) for bread pudding, which I like. Extra good  with Hard Sauce--recipe from this website.

I made this as the recipe is written, which is rare on this site. This is a pretty straight-forward recipe. The time should be extended to about 40-50 minutes, though. Instead of 3 c. of milk, it should be two and that would probably get it to the right baking time. Good job, though

The husband really liked this.  The only thing I would do different is to melt an additional 3 tablespoons of butter in the bottom of the casserole dish and then sprinkle some sugar in the butter.  Maybe the crust would be a little crispier.

This was my first bread pudding ever. As others recommended, I used 5 eggs instead of 6, but it still tasted quite eggy. I also used cinnamon bread instead of regular bread. People  seemed to like it; describing it at "like French toast".  It was all right for a first attempt.

This was perfectly nice, but nothing spectacular.  Also, I found it too eggy rather than custard-y.  If I were to make it again I'd leave out one egg.  I used golden raisins plumped in hot water, whole wheat bread, and cut down the sugar a bit.

I buttered slices of bread and layered it a baking dish before pouring over the egg/milk mixture. Used a brioche loaf and also added some raisins. My husband thought it was wonderful. I am not really a fan of bread puddings so thought it was just ok.

This recipe was very easy, but needs more sugar.  It is just not sweet enough.  I made a glaze to go over it. Everyone loved it!

I left out the raisins (personal preference) and only used 5 eggs.  I don't think the 6th egg is necessary. It turned out very good.  My husband enjoyed it alot too, but I think it needs a sauce or topping of some sort.

I just pulled this out of the oven and ate a bowl, and I have to say for how simple this is to make it is a wonderful cold weather dessert!  I have never made bread pudding, and have only had it once, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I only used four eggs (all I had) and it turned out perfect!  I omitted the raisins and added a chopped apple.  As soon as it came out of the oven, I sprinkled cinnamon sugar over the top.  This will be even better with a vanilla sauce or ice cream over it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good.  This is quite rich, and I only use 5 eggs.  It fills the pan perfectly and bakes up delicious, crunchy/crispy on top and custardy with no grains (baked straight in the oven).  If you like bread pudding this is a good and simple one!  You can also change it up.  I've mixed croissants, white and whole wheat bread; and added bananas and cranberries.  Great recipe to adapt, just leave the liquid ingredients the same and it works.

This is a great bread pudding.  I did make a few changes.  I doubled the recipe and used ten eggs instead of 12. It fit nicely in a 13 x 9 cake pan.  I tripled the cinamon and nutmeg.  It had a nice falvor, and feel that it may have been bland without it.  Next time instrad of using raisins I will used chopped toasted pecans.  All in all, a good recipe.

I was looking for a recipe similar to the bread pudding my grandmother used to make...this one's it!  I substituted the nutmeg for cinnamon and added a little almond extract and chopped almonds.  Drizzled it with sweetened condesed milk and enjoyed it with memomries from my childhood.  Thanks Nancy!!

I loved this recipe, though I made a few small changes.  I scaled it down to 4 servings, sinced there is only my husband and I, then I reduced the milk by 1/4 c. It made a more custard like dish.  We are not that fond of nutmeg, so we replaced with cinnamon instead.  We love to whip this up for a late night snack and pour half and half (cream) over each dish.  Lovely!

This is a perfect dessert to throw together at the last minute with ingredients around the house.  I didn't have raisins so I didn't use them and it was still delicious.  I served it with a little ice-cream on top when it was warm from the oven.

This recipe was great!  I used 5 eggs instead of the 6 and I also used Lactose free Milk and Smart Balance Dairy Free Butter since I'm severely lactose intolerant.  It came out creamy and soft without being too mushy.  This is one of my new favorite deserts to make !

I wanted to add my 2 cents... I basically wanted to use most of this recipe as it was what I recalled from the recipe I lost,darn it. I only made a couple of changes. I used 1/2 cup heavy cream because its what I had, I also substituted craisens because its what I had, and I use a loaf of Asiago Artisan bread ...and if you have never tried any other loaf ..try it... it is so awesome. Many years ago I had received a 2 qt. pampered chef stone bowl, it is what is dedicated for bread pudding, delicious to the last scrape of the crust in the bowl.

I liked this recipe, however I used half a cup of milk less. I tend to like an eggier pudding. My only wish is I wish I would have added cream to the milk, and used half milk half cream for richer flavor. I still loved it and it didn't feel to heavy this way, felt less fattening so maybe it's better.

Loved it not to sweet and helps me get rid of all the bread that goes to waste. Instead of white bread I used wheat bread and instead of 10 slices I used 12

I have made this recipe several times and never had a problem! I like cinnamon so I use 2 tsp (or more) and also use Great Harvest Cinnamon Chip bread. YUMMY!

I love this recipe..I cheated and used half milk and half heavy cream.  I used 12 slices of bread, instead of 10.  It took 35-40 minutes to get golden brown.  It smells heavenly coming out of the oven.  I used 5 eggs, like one of the reviewers recommended.  I also substituted real butter for the margarine....Wow! What a flavorable custard.  Next to e, I will add orange zest.  Topped with powdered sugar...

Excellent recipe. I did make some changes. I reduced the milk by 1/2 cup. I also added 1/2 tsp cinamon to the eggs. Baked for 10 minutes longer (since I don't like wet bread pudding) Came out wonderful. This is my go to recipe.

Oh my gosh, this is so good! I always read a bunch of reviews to see what the consensus is on "tweeking" recipe, and this was no exception. I used baguette bread (after cutting up let it sit for the morning to dry out a bit). Left out raisins (we don't care for them). Used 1/2 tsp cinnamon & 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, 5 instead of 6 eggs, used 1/2 c. brown sugar (I was out of white), and only 1/4 tsp of salt. Baked it in a 2 qt baking dish set in a larger water filled baking dish. That's how my Mom used to do it. Baked for 45 minutes. Topped with an easy-to-make butter sauce: Place in small sauce pan the following: 6 T. butter (melted), 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. milk (I used 2%....cream would be yummy!) and 3/4 tsp vanilla. Whisk till heated up and slightly thickened. Pour over bread pudding. Yum....what else can I say!?

The recipe is great! Too much sugar for my taste, but that is easily fixed. Here, in Finland we make similar thing out of older buns, the cardamom tastes great in this!

Excellent! And so easy! I used a loaf of dry hard Artisan bread..sour dough I think. Aprox 4cups. Removed the hard crust. All the eggs, no nutmeg. Baked 375 for 25 min....nowhere near done, not even browned on top. Increased heat to 400 for another 15 min. (maybe my oven is off?)
Done! Just like Nanna's. Even better cold.

I used 9 bun slices, only 2C milk & omitted the raisins. I also drizzled the top w/ honey for the last 5 minutes of baking. AMAZING recipe & what a great way to use up bread that would otherwise go to waste. Always a hit w/ friends, coworkers, and family. Added bonus: your house will smell delicious all day! Thank-you for this great recipe. Yum :-)

Just made this recipe and took a bite...a winner for us and will make it more.  I had half a loaf of European sliced French bread so used that since we eat mostly wheat bread.  It was perfect, worth 5 stars any day.  Thanks for sharing!!

This is a wonderful base recipe for bread pudding.  I've made it a couple times and have some tips that might be helpful:  First, you can make this in an 8x8 glass baking pan, it's just the right size.  Secondly, to know if you have enough bread, the cubes should completely fill the dish, level with it on top (if it's a small specialty loaf you might need 12 slices).  When you pour in the egg mixture the bread will absorb it and fill the dish perfectly.  Also, I just mixed the spices into the eggs rather than tossing and sprinkling (I used pumpkin pie spice blend), and I used butter rather than margarine and wayyyy less salt; half a teaspoon would be quite salty to my taste.  And lastly, I tried this once with raisins that I soaked in a couple tablespoons of rum for an hour, and once using about half a panettone instead of bread (and omitted the raisins), and both batches were awesome.

Pleasantly surprised!
I made a few changes:
1. I used stale, week old home-made whole wheat rolls instead of white bread slices (worked great!)
2. Used brown sugar instead of white. 
3. Used chopped granny smith apples instead of raisins. 
4. I didn't have any nutmeg.

I learned a few things:
1. Using apples gives you a break from all that sugar and gives you a sense of freshness. I sauteed the apples in butter first, which I won't do next time, because I think it cooked out too much of the tartness. I ended up adding some fresh, raw apples to each plate which gave it that sweet/tart balance I was looking for. It actually was DELICIOUS with the fresh granny smith apples.
2. Bread pudding is a lot like french toast! So we pulled out the left overs and had it for breakfast this morning. My 4 kids and hubby loved it! 
3. The maple syrup or powdered sugar topping is what really makes this dish. We generously used powdered sugar.

This is a great bread pudding base. Like many people I change recipes by what I have on hand or to suit our tastes. I used 16 slices of white bread, using up what I had left that was going stale. I cut down to 5 eggs and used 1 cup brown sugar in place of the white. I also had no raisins so I sprinkled a handful each of coconut, white chocolate chips, dark chocolate chips, and pecans. I poured the milk mixture over the bread and let soak while my oven preheated. I  baked for 30 minutes and it came out perfect! I will definitely be keeping this recipe on hand.

I had never made nor eaten bread pudding before so I wasn't sure what to expect.  This was good.  My husband really liked it.  I always make recipes as written the first time, and will make this again, but with some changes to make it a bit more "custardy".

Good basic recipe.  

I omitted the raisins, hubby doesn't like them.  I also only added 1/2 cup sugar rather than the full amount and 5 eggs rather than 6 per the other reviews.   I used 4  stale whole wheat hamburger buns instead of the white bread..  Perfectly filled a 8x8 baking dish.  Cooking time was 40 minutes and that was barely enough.
  For the next time , I will increase cooking time to 45 minutes, and maybe add some pecans.  Maybe if the pieces are small enough then they wont fall to the bottom as other reviews have stated that their fruit does.

This could be served with a sauce of some sort, but I think it is pretty good on its own.

Yum! I think that next time, I am going to try baking it in a water bath because it was a little mushy instead of custardy. Also, the top of my bread pudding was pretty hard but this may be because I didn't use all of the milk and egg Mixture. I was worried about it being too soggy.

Great recipe! Just a few changes...used 10 slices of regular white bread and about 5 slices of potato bread, used just a bit over a cup of sugar, added 2 cups of milk and 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and added 2 1/2 tsp of french vanilla extract. Also had to let it cook for about 45mins.  Topped with a french vanilla caramel sauce.  Amazing!!!!

This was my first time making bread pudding ever.  My husband requested it.  So, I found this recipe.  It was so easy and my husband LOVED IT!  I did make some very slight changes.  Instead of 3/4 cups of white sugar, I added 1/4 cup of light brown sugar and the rest white sugar.  I also baked it  15 minutes longer in the oven.   I think next time, I going to soak my raisins in rum or whiskey and add some fruit like bananas and pears to see how it turns out.  But this is a keeper! UPDATE:Today, I made this again and added 1 banana, 1 pear, and 1 apple (slice and peeled of course).  And I added butterscotch chips and golden raisins.  DELICIOUS!  I made it for Father's day and my father, step-father, and step-mother loved it!  This time I only used light brown sugar and I baked it for 1 hour.  This recipe is definitely a keeper...it's so simple to make!

Great recipe! I was really craving some good bread pudding and this hit the spot big time. I made a double batch in a 13x9 and it turned out amazing. I added more cinnamon but should have added even more. I just sprinkle it with cinnamon sugar while I am eating it. The kids love it. If you make a double batch, you will need to cook it for over an hour.

Excellent! Thank you for sharing this!  5 eggs worked well (I was short); and I used free-run eggs which imparted a beautiful yellow colour to the dish. I also cut the sugar to about a half-cup and increased the cinnamon and nutmeg.

4 1/2 stars really.  This is a great basic recipe, so quick and easy to make, even I can do it!  Definitely make this one as written the first time, it is so close to "just right".  I found that 6 eggs seemed like way too much, but just one less is perfect.  I also add a little more milk, maybe half a cup, and a whole cup of sugar instead of 3/4.  It comes out a little gooey and a little on the sweet side, just the way I like it.  More puddingy than bready. ;)  My husband says it is exactly what bread pudding is supposed to be.  Yay!  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

Very easy to make.  It was a little too much custard for me.  I like the stuffing to be a little runny.  However, my husband loved it.

Very good...!!! However, I found it to be very, very moist.. almost too moist in my opinion... I will make this again, but the next time I will mix all the ingredients together first and add bread last... since size of bread slices can "vary"... I think possibily you may need more than the 10 slices called for in the recipe...??  Haven't tried it yet, but I think adding cubed apples or peaches to this in place of the raisins would be delicious also...??  Excellent recipe...!!!

I love bread pudding and this recipe was great and quite simple based on the fact that I am not a cook and definitely not a baker. I added pecans and I also let the bread mixture sit in the wet mixture in the bowl before putting back into the baking dish which I sprayed with butter-flavored pan. This recipe is so easy and my boyfriend (my guinea pig) and I loved it and I will definitely be making it again.

So easy and so good. I crave this stuff. I save the leftovers of my home made white bread in the freezer and when I have enough I make this. The best part is that I almost always have what I need on hand, so I can whip it up for guests or just for an easy snack whenever.

Good recipe for bread pudding.  I did add 2 apples, sliced and peeled, to the bread, butter, cinnamon, and raisin mixture.  The bake time took a bit longer, about 1hr - 1hr 15 min.  30 minutes in the oven and it seemed there was just too much liquid still.  Not sure if that's because I made the recipe as is, except for my addition of the apples, with the 6 eggs instead of the other reviews that said to use 5 eggs.

This turned out even better than I thought it would. The only change I made was to use cinnamon swirl bread instead of reglar white bread.

This is a fantastic bread pudding. I took note of others saying it could be to egg tasting so I added 4 extra slices of bread. As we like it not custard like. It got thumb up reviews from the family and guests. Perfect consistency. Will add this one to my list. thank you!!!

I substituted 10 pieces of wheat bread for 10 pieces of  white bread which was probably a mistake. The end result that I had a dish of brown bread cubes that were too dry. Next time I will use white bread as suggested or use less wheat bread.

This is a keeper. I made this for my grandmother and she was so impressed with the look of it while baking, she turned on the oven light and made everyone come look at it. Our family loves chopped nuts added to our bread pudding and if it's one of those nights for an extra special dessert, we top it with a drizzle of hot carmel sauce and whipped cream. Yummy!

This was so good! One of if not the Best recipes I've used. My family loved it. I used 5 of the small portugues sweet bread instead of 10 slices of bread and the combo tasted like a cinnamin bun. Delicious!!!

Oh is this good...I threw it together at the end of a fairly stressful day.  It's comfort food at it's best.  Just based on personal taste I increased the cinnamon and omitted the nutmeg.  I'm keeping this one!!!

Instead of bread, I used some cranberry muffins I made that turned out kind of doughy and bland.  They sure are tasty now.  :)

This was very good. I did make 2 modifications to the recipe though. I used a whole wheat challah as the bread, I used about 8 1/2 inch slices. I also substituted the raisins for 2 sliced and peeled apples. It took about 10 minutes longer to cook in the water bath, but it came out fabulously, and the kids and I loved our Saturday breakfast.

Yummy, easy, simple, served with some whipped cream in dessert dishes with a little nutmeg sprinkled on top of the whipped cream. . .looked way fancier than it was to bake!

I had never made bread pudding before.  I modified this recipe a little: used evaporated milk, and cinnamon raisin bread.  I didn't have nutmeg so I skipped that.  It was great.  Since then I have also skipped heating the milk, just mixing all the egg, milk, sugar etc together and pouring over the bread.  Increase the baking time to 40 minutes. Turned out just as good.  Thanks for this recipe.

Awesome recipe!  This was my first attempt at bread pudding and it was delicious...I'm going to make it again for Easter but this time I'll top it with fresh strawberries.  I only used 5 eggs, like others suggested, and french bread from Costco. Thanks for an easy & tasty recipe!

This is a super recipe,moist & delicious. I did cut back on the bread as I like it more custardy. I use only 6 slices. 
You won't be dissapointed with this easy recipe!

This bread pudding was great! Made it for Easter and everyone loved it. It was a very easy recipe. Instead of white bread I used an italian bread from the bakery.  Also used the Rum Sauce recipe from this site.

This is a great recipe, but I put a MAJOR twist on it. Any of you who have a Super Wal-mart have seen their pound cakes. They are already sliced and sold in flavors like butter, marble (1/2 chocolate), pastachio, etc... 

Well, when these are old they reduce the price to about $1.66. Take them and cube them and make this bread pudding. I have to double the recipe because my family fights over it every time. It is perfect for a sweet dessert!!

P.S. You will need to cook for about 45 minutes for this change.

Love it. It was sooo easy, and I looked thru my grandmother's old cookbooks and found the perfect vanilla sauce to go with it. Unfortunately, I lost that recipe and have been looking for a quick, easy recipe on Allrecipes but havn't had much luck so far. This is definitely "no-frills" but that's the way I like it. It's so simple and like the FunkyChef I omited an egg (making it 5 eggs) and that was the trick to really perfecting this. Thanks FunkyChef! I'll definitely make this maaaaannnnyyy more times (:o)

A great way to use up stale bread, this recipe couldn't be simpler.  I cooked mine in a water bath, as some reviewers suggested, but think that I will skip that step next time because we happen to like it a little firmer.

This recipe was really, really good and very versitile!  I used bread straight from the sandwich loaf you buy for sandwiches. I had a can of Comstock apples that I chopped and added in, and the juice left in the can I added to the margarine (it wasn't much).  Then I was thinking that it might come out too moist, so I thought some oatmeal might be good, all I had were the packets of instant Maple & Brown sugar, so I added two of them, and it came out really really good!  Not too moist.  I might add a little more sugar next time as the apples didn't have any and it needed extra.  Otherwise, really yummy!  I too used the the vanilla sauce from Grammas Bread Pudding, it made the sugar mixture that was missing just right, otherwise, too sweet.  Will use this one over and over again!

I'd never made Bread Pudding before today. I went online, found this website and the recipe. One hour later, the pudding was made and eaten. My husband and baby both loved it and it was so easy. I will definately use the recipe again.

I made this recipe for my Dad.  His opinion is that no one makes Bread Pudding like his mother used to.  Well on Thanksgiving he could not stop raving about how great it was, he even made sure my Mom took a copy of the recipe so she could make it at home. The only thing I changed was to pour a warm vanilla sauce over it as it was served. DELICIOUS!!!!

yummy!  i used less sugar (2/3 cup instead of 3/4 cup), and added some sweetened whipped cream on the top.  i also modified it just a bit by putting a thin layer of raspberry jam in the bottom of the pan before layering the bread on the top.  go a bit lighter on the sugar if you do this, so it doesn't turn out too sweet.  but it's great with the jam!

This was my first time making bread pudding, so I picked this recipe.. My husband loved it and so did I.  Very tasty even though this is one of those naughty recipes that is so fattening.. We love to splurge like this..
Thank you

I took my chances and made two pans of this at the last minute for a church gathering. Everyone LOVED it! I personally do not like any breaded pudding, however this will continully be a favorite at my house for the rest of my family. Thanks for comig to my rescue at the last minute.

This is the best "Old School" no frills way way to make Bread Pudding.
Just dot the top with more butter before you bake for even more deliciousness!
You will love this recipe :)

I have made this more than once.  This time I made it by increasing the recipe for the bread by 1 1/2.  I used 3 8x8 pans and it worked great. For the sauce I decreased by 1/2.  I  felt the full was to much.

Thank you for sharing!! This is much like the bread pudding my mom used to make back in the 70s! I lost the recipe so I am so happy to be able to find one like the one she made.

My first time making a bread pudding. Has been years since I even had any.  This recipe was easy. I used 5 eggs instead of 6. Added the cinnamon to the liquid instead of the bread. Also used wheat sandwich bread since it was outdated.  Used a little less sugar and it seems sweet enough.  Awesome. I keep going back for another bite.  I really don't know why I waited so long to make it myself.

I’ve made this several times, and while always tasty sometimes it’s crispy on the top and soggy on the bottom. So this last time I let the bread chunks set in a bowl on the counter overnight to dry out a bit,then instead of pouring liquid mixture over the bread in the baking dish I poured the bread chunks back into the bowl of liquid mixture and made sort of a mush. I poured the mush into the baking dish and baked 5 minutes more. Same ingredients, different order and WOW! what a difference. It came out more like a loaf and it was done all the way through.

I used some pumpkin bread that needed to be used or tossed. I added a little less sugar (only 2/3c) since the bread was sweet on its own. Substituted half of the milk for cream.  Used real butter instead of margarine, used more cinnamon and baked in a pan of water for more of a custard texture.  I was concerned about the final product since I was using a more dense bread to start, but it turned out great.  I did increase the bake time to 40 min and left it in the oven 5 min after I turned it off.  Got a crunchy top and custard inside. Yummmm.

This was my first try at bread pudding. It was so easy and absolutely delicious!  My only changes were based upon reading the other reviews.  I used 5 eggs, 2 tsp. cinnamon, 2 cups half n half, 1 cup milk, and 1 cup light brown sugar instead of 3/4 cup white sugar.  Everything else as written in the original recipe.  I did bake for 40 minutes in a pan 1/2 full of water.  It smelled heavenly baking and tastes even better.  A new family favorite!

I liked this recipe but made a few substitutions. I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk, and only 5 eggs. Also, made a whisky sauce to top, combine 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup butter, cream and whiskey in a small saucepan. Warm over low heat, stirring constantly, until sauce is gently boiling. Pour sauce over baked bread pudding and serve.

I read the reviews and chose to cook the dish in a water bath for 90 mins. I followed the recipe with the exception of substituting half the milk with half and half cream, using thick sliced cinnamon raisin bread and sprinkling the top with nutmeg.
Very tasty with caramel sauce and whipped cream, my kids loved it.
Must allow the pudding to set before eating or its too wet. 
I will make this again but add more than the tsp of cinnamon and perhaps add 2 more slices of  cubed bread.
Thanks for the recipe...a keeper!

I made the recipe exactly as written - no substitutions. I did however add a butter/confectioners sugar glaze to the top. My family LOVED IT, and raved. Will definitely make this again!

This was just what I was looking for in a bread pudding—nicely eggy/custardy and not too sweet. I made a couple of alterations based on other reviews, what I had on hand, and by accident. I used 1-1/2 cups milk and 1-1/2 cups heavy cream to make it richer. All I had for bread was a loaf of crusty French bread I'd bought to make garlic bread with, so I cubed it and put it in a 200-degree oven for 10 minutes to dry it out, since it wasn't stale. Also, I accidentally doubled the cinnamon, which didn't hurt the final product at all. I served it piping hot, straight out of the oven, and my teenage son (who's a picky eater) liked it so much he had seconds.

Good recipe. I made a few changes for mine, but used this recipe as a guide. For mine, I used about 3/4 cubed French bread loaf, 5 eggs instead of 6, a little more cinnamon, and I added a mashed up banana. I also baked it a tiny bit longer. It was good, but even better the next day! It was gone in 1.5 days!

I make enough to serve 5 people but I finish everything and then think why it finish so fast and I should make way more next time. I never make no changes so I follow everything like in the instructions cause I never eat this pudding before. I never know it taste so good

Awesome! Used cinnamon raisin nut bread, pretty much followed the rest of the recipe except used warm milk instead of hot and I added a simple brown sugar “icing” to the top for a little extra sweetness.  Wish I’d used about a half cup less milk and added extra nuts but this was by far the tastiest bread pudding I’ve ever made- and it was so easy! Lots of leftovers for the week.

Great pudding a light desert that lends itself to toppings easily. With or without raisins its texture is soft. Ice cream or wip cream are great on top.

I had my stale loaf ready, it was twice the bread so I doubled everything including the time. LOVED it. Lovely flavor, didn't flatten out, stayed firm yet creamy custard bread pudding melted in my mouth. I will make this again and again. Sent part across the hall and the neighbor came back for more.  the soft crusty top was as flavorful as the inside. I did take license as I put all wet ingredients in the vitamix, used cold milk and poured it over the bread. 10 min later in the oven.

I made this for Easter dinner at my sister's apartment it was easy and delicious but next time I will put the raisins in with the eggs & milk mixture as they all settled on the bottom instead of dispursed throughout the pudding. Excellent!!

I made this delicious dessert twice in one week - and I think it is going to be a staple in our house.  I tweaked it a little using 1 Tablespoon of cinnamon (we love it!), 3 teaspoons of vanilla and melted 3 Tablespoons of butter in the bottom of the pan in addition to the 1/4 Cup melted butter added to the custard.  It is extra rich and doesn't last long at our house!

This was the first time I have ever made bread pudding.  I thought it turned out really well.  The consistency was good.  If I make it again however I will definitely add more cinnamon(personal taste).

First time I ever made bread pudding and it turned out great. I used some leftover homemade bread that I didn't want to waste. I did leave out the raisins and sprinkled a little extra cinnamon on top. It took about 10 more minutes to bake than the recipe said but I'm not sure that isn't due to my oven. I also made a confectioners sugar glaze to add once it cooled. I was surprised at how easy it was.

Making it from Africa I had to adjust a few things and make some substitutions.  Instead of regular milk, I bought a couple cans of sweetened condensed milk and added some water and heated it.  And with no nutmeg available, I just added extra cinnamon.  I have no measuring cups and everything I buy is in grams, so I guessed on all of my measurements and I cooked in an oven that you light with a match and I had no idea on the heat, but 30 minutes was the perfect amount of time and when the dessert came out of the oven, my friends and I gathered around the pan, each of us with spoons in our hands and we devoured every last bit of it and everyone thought it was delicious!!

I made this as the recipe stated using a 3 to 4 day old loaf of a nutty wheat bread and dried cranberries because that's what I had on hand. This was very good to me. Not too sweet. Easy too. Excellent. Its a keeper for our house.

I used a 12oz bag of the sweet Hawaiian rolls (just tore them up) and put it in a 9x13 glass pan (3 qt.).  It was perfect.  It actually tasted a bit like a modified version of French toast so we will be having it for breakfast this week as well.

I and used cinnamon raisin bread (an entire loaf) , 4 eggs and half milk, half heavy cream.  I didn't add raisin nor cinnamon (in the bread). I also added 2 slices of white to it because the loaf wasn't quite as full as 10 slices of white. I just took bits and pieces from other reviews and voila!  Perfect, simple bread pudding.

First of all I should preface that I have always really disliked bread pudding and it's my first time making it on my own. I made it for my father who had leftover rasin bread that was getting dry. I had to cut the recipe to 2/3rd of the original because the amount of bread I had, but I kept all ingredients the same other than the bread and let me tell you it was fantastic! Props to the original cook because this made me love bread pudding. Thank you so much for sharing!

Sheherazade1 inspired me to do try making this recipe with the water bath so it would be more custardy, and it worked beautifully.  The inside was light and pudding-like, the top was just a little crisped.  Also, make this with real butter. Remember: Margarine =/= love.

Alternatively, this could be made ahead before the baking step, and left covered in the fridge as it's soaking.  Morning breakfast would be a snap, just pop it in the oven. I'm guessing it might need a few extra minutes of cooking time if you have it chilling in the refrigerator for several hours.

Delicious, perfect bread pudding - quickly! I used some stale baguette and it was amazing, custardy and creamy with a crispy top. I subbed chocolate chips for the raisins, and I used light brown sugar since that was all I had. I'll definitely be making this again next time I have leftover bread.

If you're dealing with unsliced bread, 10 bread slices is about 350g or about 3/4 pound by weight.  Otherwise, a very simple recipe, although I would suggest adding more cinnamon or nutmeg for flavor.

I made this recipe today to serve at a lunch tomorrow for the needy. Of course it was necessary to taste it ahead of time.LOL. Amazingingly delicious. Will definitely make this recipe again and again. I doubled the recipe and added 20 min. To baking time. Turned out perfect!  (Hope I can hide the area where I tasted it.)

Love it! Not a raisin fan, so I left those out. Followed everything else though and it is delicious. Especially with vanilla ice cream on top :). Yumm thank you for this recipe, I won't let it go!

One of the easiest and yummiest recipe available online! Trust me when I say easy because this was the first time I baked anything in my life. The only change i made was to add 1 1/2cups of cream and 1/2cup of milk. I cant stop looking at it! Thanks a ton

My family and I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe.  I did however, alter the recipe slightly (I shouldn't have).  I added chopped apple.  FAIL.  LOL  Stick to the recipe - you'll enjoy it.

Nice -- but even better if you add things to it, like... - 2 Tbsp grated coconut (unsweetened); - 2/3 cups chopped walnuts; - a good handful of dry raisins (fat, golden ones are best!); - 3 chopped sweet apples. Like others on this board, I have used brown sugar - a little less than what was asked for in the recipe, because of the dry raisins which are already quite sweet. Oh... and I have served it with 6% natural yoghurt! If you have a sweet tooth, you can even top the yoghurt with a little maple syrup!!!

Crashed and burned!  Not sure what I did wrong...Maybe I shouldn't have used a round 2qt baking dish, maybe the "hot milk" wasn't hot enough.  In any event, after an hour,  it still wasn't done in the center and the top was burned.  What constitutes "hot milk" anyway?

The best Bread Pudding I have ever tasted and indeed made. I always get great reviews when I make this. I have to make sure I serve myself otherwise it will be devoured before I get a chance to taste it. It works out perfect every time. Thanks for posting.

Easy... Delicious.....Loved it!  The only things i did differently were, I used 1/2 Milk and 1/2 Heavy cream and I had large rolls on hand so I used those.  Will definitely make this recipe again and again!

I love this recipe.  I hadn't made bread pudding since 2007.  Yesterday I decided to make some.  I found this recipe which is really simple and went with it.  However I did add my own little twist.  Instead of using all Vanilla.  I did half Vanilla and half Brandy flavoring.  Turned out Really good.

I made this for my son-in-law, who is constantly on the lookout for the perfect bread pudding. He took one bite and happily proclaimed that "this is it!" I followed the recipe as written except I took the shortcut of using cinnamon raisin bread (the entire loaf), and cooking for an additional 10 minutes since the middle wasn't quite done after 35 minutes. Delicious!

This was great! Used brioche heart bread my husband bought me for valentines day. Followed tips and added butter sautéed apple but due to diabetic needs of my husband used brown sugar Splenda, skim milk, but shaved fresh nutmeg and cinnamon and tossed w the bread cubes. Did the water bath and cut the recipe in half for the 2 of us. Just wonderful!!!!  Unbelievably good. shot the diet by serving  with a dollop of fresh real whipped cream. Sooooooo good.

Comfort food with a big C!!! The bread pudding recipe my grandparents and mother made when I was much, much younger! But, we don't add the melted butter. I call it my "best French toast." I cook up a batch of this bread pudding and freeze in individual portions. When I want something sweet for breakfast I warm it in the microwave, add a little maple syrup, and I have a fuss-free "better than French toast" breakfast. My family used to serve it in a bowl with just a bit of milk - cold if the pudding was hot and warm if the pudding was cold - no microwaves back then!

This recipe is a great basic recipe! Great flavor! Next time, I'm going to use day old French bread instead of Texas toast that I used. I will also use one less egg and a little less milk to see if it helps. I like my bread to be less mushy, i like it almost chewy.  I also baked the casserole dish in a water bath which could have led to the mush. I did make a brandy sauce using a 1/2 cup cream, 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 brandy. It was amazing!!! Great compliment to it. Ill definitely use this again with a few minor changes.

This was really good. My whole family loved it. I've never had bread pudding before, or made it so I didn't know what to expect. I used 5 eggs instead of six, 1 tbsp of cinnamon and I made a vanilla sauce to go on top. I loved the nutmeg and the sort of crunchiness on top. Great recipe. (:

Good, easy recipe.  Made this tonight for dinner guests - BIG hit!  Does require a bit longer to bake than suggested but worth the wait.  Served with a brown sugar/maple and pecan sauce - excellent!  (Omitted raisins because I don't like them.)

For my first time I think it turned out pretty good.  I used some left over hot dog buns and half a loaf of some cinnamon raisin bread.  Because of this I used less cinnamon and raisins in the recipe.  It would be a little bit better with a Carmel topping and it was a little "eggy" for my taste.  Maybe next time I will use one less egg.  But this is one I will make again.

I hate throwing away bread.  My husband also sometimes gets old subs from the store he works at.  This recipe is perfect for them.

This is a really good bread pudding.  I tried it because you used a different method of putting it all together than I usually use.  You win...your way is best.  I changed the sugar for Splenda and it worked really well.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This is really good and easy. I used a vanilla sauce from another posted bread pudding recipe to pour on top. I didn't change anything.  I didn't give it five stars because it didn't have a sauce with it for that extra mmmmm. By itself it is 4 stars.

I had never made this before and this is my first posting after years of using this site.   I used 1 tablespoon of cinn, but could have used 2.  Cooked for 40 minutes in a waterbath and soaked the raisins for about an hour beforehand in warm water. Thanks for the tips, it turned out AMAZING!!!!!

This was worth eating, but I thought it was a little too eggy.  The nutmeg was strong, so use sparingly.  All of the other recipes seem to be the same, but definately not the Commander's Palace.

this is a great recipe! When making "8" servings i added two extra tablespoons of margarine, and bananas. IT TASTED AMAZING. esp with vanilla ice cream. All bread puddings should have some sorta fruit.

This was pretty good. A wee bit too much cinnamon, and too many raisins for me, but the flavor was good overall. It did take three times as long to cook as stated, though. Thanks for a good recipe that is fairly close to mom's!

Very easy to make.  Family loved it, esp my English mum.  She loved the extra cinnamon and I added just a touch extra sugar. (She has a sweet tooth). When i cut the cubes, I placed them on a cookies sheet and toasted them in the oven while I was mixing up the custard. It really absorbed the liquid, and I used evaporated milk mixed w/water, the flavor very nice.  Definately a keeper!

: D This was fantastic!!  I did 1/2 the recipe in a 9x5 pan at 350--it took like an HOUR, which was annoying, but it turned out great. And crispy. Also short 1/4 cup of milk but that was OK too. Have fun with this one! (would have tasted better with apples or other fruit like that but i didn;t have ani)

I made this for my dad because he loves bread pudding and he seemed to really enjoy it. I thought it was good but not very sweet.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins.  It was very easy to make.

This was sooooo good! I grew up eating my mom's bread pudding, but this was the first time I've ever attempted it myself. I followed other recommendations such as decreasing the eggs & increasing the cinnamon, but the base recipe itself is perfect. I think I accidentally added too much milk, but it's my own fault because I'm not always the best at "measuring". Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

Mmm. Excellent. I used STALE french bread (we're talking hard-as-a-rock), so I used extra milk (close to 4 cups) and I added the melted butter to the egg/ milk mixture and poured it all over the bread rather than just the butter first. This helped the bread absorb the flavors more evenly. I used skim milk, and only 3 eggs, letting the bread sit for a good 30 minutes before baking until it puffed up. Delicious!

This was okay. I didn't have the right size bake ware so I had to use a couple of small dishes. I think that because of this, there didn't seem to be much to it. It also didn't seem like it was sweet enough. But I am going to try making this again with the right size dish

This is the second time this weekend that I am making this fabulous recipie! I don't put in rasins but I substitute them for blackberries!! YUMMY! I think rasbessiers would also do nice! I had to cook it a bit longer, but I think it is due to my dish I am using. Just amazing, thanks!

So easy and so yummy! I used soy milk and you couldn't even tell the difference. Comes out perfect every time. I omit the raisins though! YUM

Too eggy, not sweet enough, the bread burnt on the top and was crunchy.

Wow, this is great.  I made this with day-old homemade egg bread cut fairly thickly, butter instead of margarine and way more cinnamon.  It was perfect for a cold rainy evening!
