Yum.. I loved this. I did also double the sauce and even so, don't expect this to be saucy like a sloppy joe. I love ground pork and this was a great way to enjoy it

Halved the recipe and eyeballed the measurements.  My 9 year old, picky eaters, twin boys loved it -- both ate 2!  Forgot to add salt but noone noticed.  I thought the brown sugar and ketchup are great!

The taste was good, but after straining the meat several times, I still couldn't get the grease out.  Served to others and received no compliments at all.  Probably would not make again.

we all really liked it. I followed the ingredients of the sauce BUT did double the sauce. I like thick saucy Joe's. 

it was very flavorful yet simple. I didn't have to chop anything up.  

my husband and I usually like to discuss  about tweaking recipes while eating. 

he said he wouldn't change a thing

7 15 15 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/233131/pork-rites-taverns/ ... Well, maybe a pound here is less than the first reviewers.  Mine was soupy.  I used half the meat - so, essentially, doubling the sauce (except for the salt) as all previous reviewers suggested.  I added a half pound cooked, crumbled Italian sausage to thicken it up.  It helped.  :)  This is a slightly tangy sauce, which I usually don't "go" for; but it was so subtle here, I liked it.  'Also don't usually try ketchup (as a key ingredient) recipes - 'Couldn't detect it.  Nice!  I sauteed onion & garlic first then completed; thickened with cornstarch, a t & a half.  I'd add less water rather than thicken; 'can always add it if it's needed.  As for the Italian sausage addition, I liked it; but wouldn't go out of my way for it.

Absolutely needed more sauce. I added some cayenne pepper and minced onions. Used half ground turkey and half ground pork.

I tried this recipe and it was a hit with my family.  The only thing I did was double the sauce part, add a chopped onion, and also added 1/4 tsp of chipotle cayenne pepper. It was amazing!
