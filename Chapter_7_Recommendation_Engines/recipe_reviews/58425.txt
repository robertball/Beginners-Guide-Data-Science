I made this nearly two years ago and forgot to review it.    I thought the recipe would have a much better flavor with soy sauce, so I steadily mixed that in a few times throughout the cooking time.  I left out the mint, ginger root, and the whole garlic cloves, but I got some minced garlic 'powder' and went slightly heavy on that instead.    Otherwise, I followed everything pretty much as the recipe says.  Myself, and my partner both LOVED it.  Really, the soy sauce set it off real nice.

This is the best recipe. I add in sour cream towards the end, but it is incredible without it. I make 2 new recipes each Sunday for lunches throughout the week for hubby and I, and my husband has asked for this MANY times.

UPDATE 1/4/16:  I'm still making this, years later. We now have 2 young kids who love it.  :)

This was just ok.  I enjoyed it but the hubby felt it was bland.  It needs seasonings and maybe a contrast taste such as pineapple, or go with some spice and add jalapeño .  Definitely needs something.  Be creative it's a good base for a dish.

Delicious! A likely an amazing cold and flu busting recipe. It’s packed with healthy ingredients, that tastes amazing to boot! The ginger packs a nice punch. We added a touch of coco aminos on the finished product, as well as served on a bed of emerald rice. But it was still really good solo. I’ll definitely be making this many times over in the future!

Wasn't exactly what I expected.. but it was good and healthy.  I tripled the recipe (big family).   Marinated the pork several hours prior to cooking in an OJ/soy sauce/ ghost pepper salsa  mix.(very little ghost pepper goes a very long way).   Cooked the pork in a fry pan and cooked down the veggies in a 7 qt D.O.  I didn't have mint, green peppers, or waterchestnuts on hand... I upped the amount of yellow and red pepper carrots and Italian parsley to compensate.    No salt/pepper/soy sauce or other spices used or needed.  It was good as is.

My family loved this dish...with a few adjustments: I removed pork after cooking it, no room for everything in 1 pan & added it back in @ the end. Never needed to add water, only a little chick broth at the end with a few shakes of soy sauce; otherwise too bland.  I put it over rice for the kids. Home run ??
