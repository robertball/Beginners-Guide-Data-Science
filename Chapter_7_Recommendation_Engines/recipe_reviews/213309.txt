My husband loved these pork chops! I used stove top stuffing, as I didn't have the peperidge farm stuffing. I also used cream of chicken gravy. I served the chops with rice and broccoli. This recipe is a keeper! :)

This was a great easy quick recipe! The pork breading came out very crispy! I used two cans of Campbell's Pork Gravy and had mashed potatoes with it also. This will be a repeat in our house!

Moist and tender don't over cook chops they are our friends. This recipe is wonderful with or without the gravy. Will never fry another chop. **Up date on this wonderful chop recipe. Out of Pepperidge farm herb seasoned stuffing,I used their cornbread stuffing with some extra rosemary and tyme added in. Made gravy from scratch. Family love it as always.

I followed the recipe to the letter....I had to cook longer than stated for the chops to "crisp" up.  They reamined soggy still, in places.  The taste was good, but beacuse of the over cooking, I thought they were dry, (although my husband thought they were great).  I didn't serve them with canned gravy, because of the sodium content.  I did have some gravy from a pork roast in the freezer, and thawed that to use.

Was excellent tasting with a twist. Instead of stuffing, I used corn flake crumbs. Easy recipe and did not take long to prepare. Meat was tender and the next day it was even better. Great recipe thank you for posting this and sharing. Will definitely be making this again.

This was actually pretty good! I loved that it was so quick and simple. A great way to prepare pork chops on a busy week night. I also really like using seasoned stuffing bread cubes to coat the chops. They stayed moist and came out very tender.

Quite tasty. My husband really liked these pork chops. Great crunch (added a little panko bread crumbs to the stuffing) and moist inside. Will make these again.

I wasn't able to find the Pepperidge Farm Herb Seasoned Stuffing.  I ended up having to use Stove Top Stuffing, it turned out very good!  I don't think it mattered a whole lot, but next time I fix it I will try to find the Pepperidge Farm brand. Will fix this again!

We made this meal tonight and it was great. I followed the recipe. Our chops were not cooked thoroughly after 20 minutes. If you have to add additional time to yours, make sure you do it in 5 minute increments. We added 10 minutes and it was a little too long for my taste. I loved the taste (although our chops were a little on the dry side), the rest of my family gobbled it up. Happy Cooking!

These were excellent, I didn't have turkey gravy all i had was country gravy. Husband like them without gravy. I also turned them over half way through cooking time and they came out crunchy. Will make these again.

I chose to add some sliced mushrooms to the gravy.  I like the concept of the stuffing as a coating, but I had issues where it wasn't as crisp as I would've liked it.

Pretty good! I modified it a bit. I used Italian bread crumbs because I didn't have stuffing. I also poured the gravy over the pork chops during the last couple of minutes in the oven.

This recipe was delicious!  My husband gobbled it up and went back for more.  I didn't have the Pepperidge Farm stuffing mix but I did have stuffing mix for pork which worked out perfectly.  I'll will make this again!

pretty average dinner.  we did not love the flavor of the breading (stuffing mix).  the gravy is a must for this recipe, and while it was fairly quick to pop in the oven so i could get everything else together for the night, it did not get excellent reviews in my house.  kids picked at it, hubby ate his but said the recipe wasn't a keeper.  thanks anyway.

They were easy to make but nothing special. I flipped them half way to get both sides crispy though. May make again but there are so many other things that might be a better way

I really like it, getting the stuffing like bread crumbs requires a blender or food processer.  We used our Ninja and it worked well.

Delicious, quick and easy.  Mine came out with a nice crunch, almost like being fried.  I made gravy with Lipton onion soup mix which added to the great taste.

I did not have Pepperidge Farm stuffing on hand, so like another reviewer suggested, I used Stove Top instead...delicious!  This will probably be my go-to recipe for pork chops from now on.

Easy and Good, i use this Same Mix  on fish. I didn't have stuffing so I used bread crumbs, salt, pepper. Recommend using a broiler pan so the don't get soggy in juices.

This recipe was excellent and very easy to make.  Loved it!  Just make sure you crush the stuffing kind of fine.  It still makes up great but it would have been better if I had of crushed them a little more.

I did not have any stuffing,  so I mixed breadcrumbs, Italian seasoning and (smashed) french fried onions.  I used aluminum foil (due to needing a new non-stick pan). My topping stuck to the foil, so I should have sprayed with cooking spray prior to placing on foil. The chops were juicy inside and crunchy on the top (bottom side was too moist and clung). Served with mashed potatoes and chicken gravy (did not have turkey flavor). I would want to try this again with the original recipe due to the moistness of the chops. I did have to cook for longer than 20 min (more like 35), but they were on the thick side.

Super yummy! I baked for 30 minutes turning at 15 minutes. When I turned the chops after the first 15 minutes I poured gravy and cooked for 15 minutes. I sprayed the pan and put real butter on the bottom before baking.

This turned out really well. As always, must be fool proof if I can manage it successfully. Used an.electric chopper/grinder to crush the bread crumbs. Cooked it longer than 20min. ...more like 35. Will definitely do this again.

Used coconut oil instead of butter, didn't have flour and used seasoned panko instead of stuffing.

First time to make this dish.  I did allow it to cook for 25 minutes to cook all the way through.  Everyone enjoyed the dish along with the home made mashed potatoes and creme cheese.
