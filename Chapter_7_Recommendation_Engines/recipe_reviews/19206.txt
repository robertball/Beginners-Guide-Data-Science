As an animal heathcare professional, I am highly upset that this site has a recipe containing a food that is poisonous to a dog's digestive system. Very upsetting that people don't do their research before posting such things for others to try on their own beloved pets. Maybe you all should check out ASPCA's website about foods your pet should eat.

These were pretty good. The texture was perfect for rolling out once I doctored it up, although I did add wheat germ and nutritional yeast for some of the all-purpose flour. My dog really liked them. I'd like to try other recipes as well. Maybe peanut butter would make it better?

Though these cookies sound really good, I think people should know that garlic and onions are toxic to dogs.  People can decide for themselves. Especially little dogs. Shari

My doxies rate these PAWTASTIC with dew claws up!!!!  Super easy to make.  I just had to add a little more beef broth to moisten the dough.  Great recipe.

I would have to omit the garlic as it is toxic to dogs.  Parsley and rosemary can be used as a flavoring. Otherwise it is very easy to make and my Corki loved them !! Lynn C.

I got a little carried away with the garlic, but once they were done they did not smell too garlicky. My dogs love 'em!

Not too bad, the dogs definately like them. I found the dough way too crumbly to roll and ended up adding an egg to get it to hold together enough to roll. A short stint in the fridge also helped with this.

My Dogs love them, I did however leave out the corn meal, as my dog does not digest it well.

Just made some doggie treats l. Our family dog loves them! Though I added a little bit of vegetable oil because it was somewhat dry.
