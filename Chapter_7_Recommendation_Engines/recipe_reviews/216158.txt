I did as one reviewer suggested and used 1 cup pumpkin and only one egg. Since I only used one egg I used 2 teaspoons baking powder.  I also added 1/4 tea cloves since I love them. Another reviewer said it made too much dough. I got two logs that were 8" X3".

This recipe was easy and very good.  On the second batch I cut down on the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp. as I'm not fond of nutmeg and added 1/4 tsp. of cloves (my favorite).

Delicious!  Makes a nice, hard biscotti that stands up to dipping.  The spices were perfect.  A great recipe for using that last bit of leftover pumpkin.

This makes way too much dough for only 2 logs 10" X 2" each!  Mine turned out about 10" X 6" each and made 30 cookies.  I didn't have parchment, so I used waxed paper instead, which made them very moist on the bottom.  I would like to have instructions on how to know when they are done. The one other time I made biscotti, I noticed it seemed rather heavy, so I added a pinch more baking powder to this recipe and liked the results.  I noticed when they were baking there wasn't much aroma, and found they didn't have much pumpkin flavor, but were good anyway.  I might try cutting back to one egg and adding another 1/4 cup pumpkin next time.  Not sure how that would work.

These were good, but not great. I really enjoyed the flavor and the pecans added a nice touch, but there was something odd about the texture. After they came out of the oven I tried one and it had a consistency almost like play-dough, kind of dry and chewy, which makes me think that there was too much flour. I'll definitely make these again, but will play around with the measurements of dry vs. wet ingredients.

I used 1 c pumpkin and 1 egg with the baking powder as suggested-- with some additional spices, I found this biscotti to still be very bland, as stated by another reviewer.... there's not enough of anything and I couldn't find a way to save this with toppings.

I tried this recipe as it sounded very interesting and I make biscotti all the time coming from an Italian family.  I found it to be very dry and no flavor at all.  I was very disappointed and will not make again.

Followed the recipe precisely so that it could be judged on its own merit - and it's terrific!  Delicious crispy biscotti - with a delightful hint of pumpkin pie.  Low fat, too, so that's a bonus.  Biscotti keeps forever - but you probably wont' need to know that...they're too darned good to last!  My advice?  Don't change a thing if you want pumpkin pecan biscotti - otherwise look for another recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing.  These cookies will be a Christmas present for a friend living 3000 miles away - so they had to be "built tough"... :)  Bonus #2?  The house smells like an upscale bakery...nice!

I added extra cinnamon. Did not have any ginger. Added chocolate chips and extra pumpkin. Mixed it all up and kept adding flour til I had a nice easy to work with consistency.  After baking I sliced it with an electric bread knife. Turned each piece onto its side and toasted a bit longer. Perfect! Not dry at all.

I like the concept, but as is, they really didn't turn out as I would have preferred.  First, to those who complained of blandness, that's because there is a lot of flour in this recipe.  On my second go-round, I used just 2 c. flour (I altered a bunch of other stuff the second time, too, but I'll just write my own version of this another time; I also believe there to be too much sugar in this recipe, too).  Mind you, BISCOTTI IS SUPPOSED TO BE A MILD FLAVORED COOKIE!!!  Second, I am always befuddled at how people get acceptable results with such high oven temps.  My oven does NOT run hot (I never have problems with other recipes), and just about every biscotti recipe I try baked at this temp turns out with a mild burnt taste on the outside and is soft in the middle.  I honestly bake mine at only 300-degrees and I just bake them slightly longer so they dry thoroughly.  Anyway, not terrible, though not spectacular.  Sorry!  I like the pumpkin-y taste, though!

Not as good as the other Biscotti I've made.  It was a little too moist for a biscotti. Did have a nice flavor.  But I won't be making again.

I am a sourdough pancake snob but I have to admit this is a great tasking pancake.  Whenever I have extra buttermilk I make this quick and easy pancake for breakfast and always rave reviews.  The recipe is easily cut into thirds which is perfect for 2 people.

This is a good biscotti recipe, although it needed a few adjustments.  I halved the ingredients as I didn't want or need 3 dozen biscotti!  The dough was extremely dry and very hard to work with, so I had to add a bit of vegetable oil, additional vanilla extract and even a small amount of water to make it workable.  I also added pumpkin pie spice to give it more pumpkin flavour.  I'd recommend adding more than the recommended serving of pumpkin puree (try 1 cup); I think this would help with the blend-ability of the dough.

This recipe was ok. It was super sticky so I had to add an additional 1/2 cup of flour. I added an additional 1/2 cup of pumpkin and a bit more cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. The extra pumpkin and spices made it better. Some people said it made too much dough. I didn't get enough. My logs were 8" x 4 1/2" x 2" and 10" x 5" x 2". I only got 22 slices out of it. If I make it again, I'm going to have to double or triple the recipe. The only thing I really liked about this recipe was that it wasn't too sweet. I will make it again but with some adjustments.

as it is written, this recipe did not work for me. this does not make a stiff batter. It makes a large batch of barely damp crumbs that need more liquid to form even a rudimentary dough. I will definitely avoid making this recipe again, as even the flavor left much to be desired, and I love pumpkin in any form.

These were super easy to make! I left the pecans out the first time I made them because my children don't  like them.  I did add a light glaze on them after the second bake.  The second time I used the pecans and my husband and invited friends raved about them.  This is definitely a keeper.

I really liked these a lot!  Great texture and taste!  I made changes only because it was easier for me and what I had on hand.  I used canned pumpkin that was already spiced and sweetened.  I also used two teaspoons of pumpkin spice that I bought a Costco.  These were a great texture and wonderful pumpkin flavor.  I will probably turn the oven down to 325 next time , because mine were not as crunchy as they should have been, but done on the outside.  I also used two squares of vanilla almond bark with about two tables spoons of the canned pumpkin (already spiced and sweetened), melted and mixed together for a really fabulous taste.  I drizzled it on after they were cooled, perfect texture and taste!  A winner for all who tried them, I couldn't leave them alone!

I did as some other posters suggested and only used one egg and increased the pumpkin to 1 cup.  I also used closer to 1/2 c. of pecans because I had chopped that many.  I found the biscotti a little too sweet for my taste so the next time I would reduce the white sugar to 1/2 cup and the brown sugar to 1/3 cup.

I did not like this recipe.  I didn't care for the consistency of the biscotti, nor the flavor. I am a pumpkin lover and have been making biscotti for years. I will not be making this one again.

The dough was very sticky and climbed up my electric beaters. I had to finish stirring by hand.  The flavor is bland.

Disappointing.  I read all the reviews and even researched other pumpkin biscotti recipes.  They were pretty much the same so I decided to give this one a try.  I made changes that were suggested such as only 1 egg and an increase in pumpkin.  As these came out of the oven, they were ok.  I did find the taste to be pretty good.  My usual trick with biscotti to make them crispy is to put them back in the still warm oven (temp turned off) and let them sit in there overnight.  But this did not do the trick.  The next morning I found them to be what I call a hard chewy.  In reviewing this recipe, I think there is too much moisture for this to be a good crisp biscotti.

I admittedly realized at the last minute that I had no pecans, and so substituted almonds instead.   But my problem with this recipe has little to do with the flavour (which, with the almonds, anyway, was quite delicious), but more to do with the fact that the baked "logs" don't spread a lot.  I like a long biscotti for dipping...the logs don't spread enough to allow for long biscottis even being cut on an extreme diagonal.


Also - if you're looking for a strong pumpkin flavour, this isn't the recipe for you..I'm tasting cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger, but very little pumpkin...

I thought these were very good. Nice flavor. I might have added a little more spices than the recipe called for since I wanted to use up the last of a container of cinnamon, but the spices were good in my opinion! The texture was sticky and I wet my hands to shape the logs, but that is typical of biscotti dough. I like mine extra crunchy so I left mine in the oven after I turned it off to make them harden up. The logs were wider than 2 inches, probably 10 by 4-5 inches. I will definitely make again.

Very tasty. Mine didn't turn out dry enough to be a biscotti, so it was more like a cookie. Still delicious. Next time

I wound up having to add a little more pumpkin than the recipe called for, since my "dough" was initially so dry that I couldn't get it to stick together, but other than that, a great recipe. Can't wait to dunk these in my coffee tomorrow morning!

Great! I doubled all the spices except cinnamon, which I tripled. Used about 2/3 cup pumpkin and had to add a little extra flour to make up for the extra moisture. Also used chopped toasted pecans instead of walnuts. Really good!
