I tweaked this just a bit to help decrease the fat and calories: did not use butter when browning the first side, and instead of mixing the blue cheese into softened butter, I used low-fat mayo (I'm sure you could even use non-fat, but low-fat is what I had); you just need to make sure the cheese is finely crumbled so that it mixes in well with the mayo.  I also used pecans, and mixed them into the spread (but if making the spread ahead of time, would not do this until right before using). And I added just a dash of cayenne to make the flavors pop!  I like to serve these with a salad of baby mixed greens with pears, pecans, and goat or feta cheese, with the Maple Balsamic dressing from this site.  Yummm - better than a 5-star restaurant!

Everyone loved this, just don't cook it too long in the oven - I kept waiting for mine to get real bubbly and the toast was too toasty. We like our toast chewy and soft, next time I'd take it out sooner.

Great recipe idea!  I did make some changes.  I only made two toasts (making lunch for myself) and omitted most of the butter, I did spread each slice thinly with butter.  Then I put on some blue cheese, and then pine nuts instead of walnuts.  Cooked for about 9 minutes at 400.  Came out great!  Will have to try walnuts next time.  Chives would be good added too.

Yum!  Fabulous and SO simple.  I left out the butter mixed in with the cheese in a feeble attempt to cut calories.  I just love bleu cheese and walnuts together...served this with the pear and roquefort salad and beef burgundy found here as well.  Thanks for sharing...my mouth is watering just thinking about them!

I LOVE this. I have been making this for years now only I use it on steaks not on bread. I mix the ingredients together in a sauce pan and heat until slightly melted then I put it on the steak about 2 min before it's done cooking.

These were good, too much butter though. And I would have liked something extra like some fresh garlic or some taragon or some other fresh herb.

Delicious. These would make very quick, easy and elegant little appetizers. I would also be interested in trying a goat cheese/walnut combination. Thanks, Elizabeth!

The bleu cheese didn't melt quite as much as I had anticipated it would, but they practically flew off the platter.

If I were just making them for me I'd have nixed the walnuts, but that is just me.

Seems the timing is too long, anyway it was for my oven. For me the timing was 5 minutes for toasting the bread slices and about 2.5 minutes for the cheese to melt. I also oiled the slices with olive oil and skipped the butter mix with the cheese. But still, it turned out great. Will surely make it again as it is easy to make and delicious.

I must not have put enough of the blue cheese/butter combination on the toast because there really was no flavor.  I used some slices of rosemary bread and had this with a fruit salad for a light dinner.  I will probably try this again and pile on the topping heavier.  Thanks!

Sorry, this was not for us, the blue cheese was to overpowering, I guess our taste are more average to the bluebuds on this site.

I had a tiny bit of leftover blue cheese crumbles I wanted to used up, and I was feeling lazy, so I just toasted two small pieces of Italian bread, topped them with blue cheese and chopped walnuts, and stuck them under the broiler until melty and bubbly. I let them cool for a minute and drizzled with HONEY. Fantastic!!! *I don't understand why anyone who doesn't like blue cheese would make a blue cheese-based recipe and then give it a bad rating because they don't like blue cheese. Thats Your issue, not the recipe's issue! I can't eat raw onions. I would Never make a raw onion salad and then slam the author of the recipe because I had an allergic reaction...jeez LOL

I was a little skeptical at first, but we like the ingredients, so I figured, "Why not?"  Glad I did!  These were easy and super-tasty.
