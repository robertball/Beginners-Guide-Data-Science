We thought this was very good in the slow cooker, and then we tried it in the oven as well and loved it.  In the oven I mixed the layers up -put the beef in the bottom of the casserole dish, then the veggies, then cheese,then potatoes so that as it cooks, the potatoes get a little crispy on top, which we love.  Added half of the fried onions in with the potatoes and added the rest on top for the last 5 minutes. We've mixed it up with different flavour soups as well.  Great!

If I could rate this higher I would. I don't have a crock with a timer. I adapted this to cook in the oven so I could make it one evening after work. I just thawed everything out and browned and drained the beef then assembled in a casserole dish. I did mix the milk, soup and cheese (not quite as much cheese as the recipe called for)in a bowl and microwaved it until the cheese melted. I poured that over the meat & veggie mixture and baked in the oven until it bubbled. Then I topped it with the onions and served with warm sourdough bread. This is delish. And, it was a snap. Thank you for a recipe I plan to use again soon!

This recipe was amazing! Easy to make and the kids inhaled it. One of the best recipes I have tried. Adds a new meaning to the phrase " comfort food " Thanks Marge !

This was very tasty. I didn't use the vegetables as my husband won't eat them. It is a very filling and comforting meal. It tastes good as leftovers also. Just bake in a casserole dish at 350 until it is warm and crunchy on top.

The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because my husband and kids ate it. Personally, it didn't do much for me.  I really think it was the process cheese flavor which I am not a huge fan of.  I even used less as other reviewers suggested.  I will make again because the family eats it and it is easy, but am going to try using some shredded cheddar in place of the process cheese and maybe peas/corn/green bean blend instead of the Califonia blend veggies.  I also cooked it in the oven instead of the crock.

Delicious!  My Wife and 1 year old both loved it too!  4/5 because that much Velveeta would have surely ruined the dish!  This was a great tasting meal that will have a place in our regular dinner rotation.  Leftovers were awesome too!  Do yourself a favor and be sure to make these modifications:  Replace Velveeta with 100g shredded cheddar, Add 4 cloves garlic and use Cream of Broccoli soup instead.  Next time I am going to try using fresh potatoes instead of hash browns!

this was an amazing recipe. i was a little scared of how the hash browns would turn out...i thought they would get too soggy. each ingredient makes the dish and it's for sure going to be a regular menu item. my husband rated it #6 out of 20 of his favorite foods i make for him. the only thing i changed was i used turkey meat instead of beef. it's healthier and reheats much better than beef. Updated: I made this again for a pot luck at work and it was a hit! My co workers devoured it! I love the simplicity of this recipe and the combinations of flavors. I originally rated this recipe a 4 but I had to move it to the 5 with the amazing feedback I get from people.

I was glad this dish had "everything" - the starch, the dairy, the veggies, and the protein.  However, it was just a little too bland for me and my husband's tastes.  I might try this recipe again though and just add a few more spices.

While this probably isn't the most healthy meal, even for a crockpot, I was surprised to find this odd combination to be tastey! Leave out the FF onions & it's a kid-pleaser. I used 1/4 tsp salt & Healthy Request cr. mushroom, I also improvised using powdered milk, shredded cheese, onion flakes and 1/2 frozen tater tots with the hash browns,neither of which were thawed but no problems. I added a can of corn & the cheese at the end. My husband loves food like this.

Yummy.

I'd use less cheese next time, maybe 8-10 ounces vs. 12 oz.  I also cooked it for 8 hours on low (I was at work), and it was not a problem.  Very hearty and my picky eater (one year old) had 3 helpings!

I am giving this only 3 stars because my husband actually ate it. I  went on a search for something that used frozen hash brown cos for some reason my husband had picked up a bag when we were shopping and they are something I don't ever really use. The frozen veg did not work in the slow cooker at all, it ended up very watery - processed cheese was very salty. I didn't use the canned french-fried onions thankfully. If I made something like this ever again, which is most unlikely, I would definitely use fresh potato and veg and per the previous reviewer's suggestion.

This was good.  I used frozen broccoli.  Nice hearty convenient meal.  I probably will not make this again though just because it isn't something that I would find myself craving.

This is pretty much a throw and go dish!  I sauteed onions and garlic with the ground beef and omited the french fried onions (personal preference).  I used fat free cream of mushroom mixed because I didn't want any chicken "flavor" in the dish.  I threw in some canned mushrooms as well.  Turned out great!

I made this the first time in the crock pot and the second time in the oven to see which way my family preferred.  They inhaled the crock pot version and the leftovers from the oven version sat in the fridge until I had to throw it out.  VERY good!

This recipe was a bit different, but overall pretty good. The texture was not the best and I might try it again with potatoes o'brien instead of shredded hashbrowns. Thanks!

It was good, but very bland. I would add more seasonings, possibly try ham instead of beef, and use less cheese.

Totally delicious! I followed the recipe, just doubling it since I have  a big family to feed, but I kept the ingredients the same, and it was a huge success! I love that it calls for things I have on hand in my freezer and my pantry. And it does not need all day to cook, but it also does not need to be fussed over, I just throw everything in and go about my day until the end when I added the cheese and french fried onions. Yum! Thank you for sharing this one, it's a keeper!

I made this recipe today and both of us loved it. I did use ground turkey instead  of ground beef, and I used 95% fat free chicken soup.  The French Fried onions add just the right amount of crunch. I may take this to one of our church dinners.

I wouldn't serve this to company or anything, and the flavor is not very sophisticated.  That said, my kids love this dish and I think it's pretty good myself.  A great weeknight dinner.  Too mushy for my husband, I have made this a couple of times when he won't be home.  Good left over, too, but not with the french fried onions.

Realize that I live in the land of "hotdishes", this was ok. I added celery, mushrooms and garlic to beef. No veleveta, used cheddar. It desperatly needed salt and pepper, more than just in the bottom. It also needed more of a sauce. With tweeks it was ok. kids really liked it, hubby and I lukewarm.

I tried this recipe b/c of the good reviews, but it did not go over well.  One of my children will eat just about anything, and he only took 2 bites.  I think it is the Velveeta cheese that we dislike.

Husband ate it all up.  The velveeta cheese was a little different (I usually use real cheese) but overall it was real "comfort food".

This was surprisingly very good! It didn't look pretty but tasted delicious.  Even my picky 11yo asked for seconds.

Very good and easy!  I ended up making it in the oven.  I thawed the potatoes and veggies, browned the meat, then layed everything.  The soup, milk, and Velveeta I melted together in the microwave into a sauce to pour over the veggies.  It needed a little salt and pepper, but was very well liked.  We'll keep it!
