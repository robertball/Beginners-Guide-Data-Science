This was the first bread pudding I have ever made and it turned out great! I doubled the recipe because I had 6 over ripe bananas I wanted to use. I mixed the liquids, bananas, eggs etc. in the evening and stored them in the fridge over night. Then I cut up the 4 large rolls I had and put them into a large, covered casserole to keep them from drying out. The next morning I poured the egg mixture over the bread cubes and let that soak while I preheated the oven. By the time my coffee was ready the oven was ready also. So I put the bread pudding into the oven and let it bake while I got ready for work. It took almost 2 hours because I had doubled the recipe. When it was finally done, I wrapped the casserole in 2 thick towels, put that and the sauce into a basket and drove to work. It was a cold morning with temperatures in the single digits and 3 inches of snowon the ground, so when I got to the office and announced I had HOT bread pudding everyone cheered. And they loved it! Personally, I thought it was a bit too sweet, but that's just me. Everyone else thought it was perfect, the best they ever had. 5 people asked for the recipe and one person said it was the perfect addition for her christmas menu this year. Everyone just loved it and there was not a crumb left within an hour of my arrival at the office. 
I bring a lot of baked treats to the office and they are always appreciated, but this bread pudding was a hit and I think the biggest hit I have had so far, even bigger tha

This had a great flavor, even though I totally bombed the recipe.  Make sure you use a square or rectangular pan so that it cooks evenly (I thought I could get by with a rounded casserole dish) and that your bread is sufficiently dried out (mine was way too moist and didn't soak up everything).  I also used milk instead of cream in the sauce, and it worked great.

An excellent bread pudding, and great way to use up bananas. I used 5 cups of bread cubes and divided it into 2 pie plates and it worked really well. I didn't have coconut or pecans, but it was fine without. I substituted vanilla extract for the rum flavoring (also lacked this ingredient!) and it still ended up being a great recipe. Loved it and will definitely make again.
