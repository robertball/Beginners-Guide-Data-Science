These turned out fantastic! I added 1/2 cup milled flaxseed in place of that much flour, then added 2-3 t. Wheat Gluten to bring up the rise. Sprinkled with Sesame seeds and the buns looked like something I'd purchased at a specialty bread store! After forming buns, flash froze part of the dough before the second rise to pull out fresh for a later use. (Google- freezing bread dough for more info on this procedure)

These were delicious!!! We followed the ingredient list exactly, minus the ranch dressing. For shaping them we simply rolled them into 6 balls and then pinched the dough from the top to the bottom to smooth them out. Then let them sit for a minute or so and then smooshed them down slightly. (We saw this from another recipe) Then we let them rise for about 20 minutes. We cooked them for only 8 minutes and they were fabulous. I don't think we will ever go back to store bought!

I made both hot dog and hamburger buns with these.  We liked them, although I had a bit of an issue with shaping.   Dough wouldn't stay stuck together in rolls.  Otherwise, easy and good flavor.  Thanks.

Thought I'd be the first to rate these.  They are really good and they look great coming out of the oven.  
I didn't have dry milk powder or any fresh milk so I went without, didn't seem to mess with the turnout.  Also I just formed the dough into 12 balls and baked them on a greased baking pan.  They were good enough to eat by themselves.  My 2 and 3 year old and I shared one to see if they'd be good enough for Daddy.  They were!  We served them with my Barbecued Shredded Beef, ranch potatoes, and cream corn.  Yum!  Thanks for the great recipe.

***Oh, yea, I also substituted 1 cup of whole wheat flour for 1 cup white.

Really great flavor!  I made these without a bread machine, and substituted sour cream for the yogurt, and used half whole wheat flour.

I made these in my bread machine and they came out really nice and fluffy! I used plain greek chobani yogurt instead of regular and I think it made a nice difference. The only thing is that I felt these were really salty. I will probably cut the salt in half next time and go lighter on the ranch. I also think it would be a great recipe just taking out the ranch. They rose really nicely too! It is a great recipe for bread machines that you can manipulate to your liking. All around a good recipe!

Delicious.  Did not have yogurt so used 1/2C Sour Cream.  I did use 3 tsp Dough Enhancer. Everything else was the same. My cousin was here for lunch and she said they look like they came from a bakery but they tasted much better.  We made our hamburgers while the buns were still a little warm and they still held up to all the "fixins" we put in them.

These were very good. The family gave 4 and 5 stars to the buns. I followed the directions exactly except I did not put the egg wash on the buns. You could detect the ranch, but it wasn't overpowering. I suppose you could adjust the ranch to personal taste. Thank you, Nancy, for the recipe!

i didnt have many things that this recipe called for like the ranch seasoning or the yogurt.  i was just making these for my husband and i for dinner tonight.  we really liked the recipe, the only thing i was upset with was i used the converter for a yield of 4 buns thinking that would be more than enough; i split the dough (made in my bread machine) into 2 balls and let rise for over an hour and they were tiny!  BUT, i'll make this again.

Yum, have made these about 4 times now (including today!) I have been putting shredded Gouda on top, then baking. Also have substituted sour cream for the yogurt... Fantastic! Thank you so much for the recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly. I've made these three times and they are great no matter what the filling inside. DH LOVES these and they are so darn pretty I am amazed with them every time. No store bought buns EVER in this house.

This recipe didn't work very well for me.  They were heavy (I called them buns of lead!).  We also didn't care for the taste.  Since others had success with them, I'll chalk it up to the many variables of breadmaking that can go wrong.  I'll look for another recipe.

Great recipe - made it as directed and it turned out beautiful and super yummy!  I used Penzeys Buttermilk Ranch and topped with sesame seeds.  I made them to go with the Ranch Burgers recipe from this site (by DAMIANSMOMMY) and added caramelized onions to make an amazing burger.  Will definitely be making these again!

These were OK, but not a single person could detect any sort of ranch taste.
