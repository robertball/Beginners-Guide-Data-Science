This bread was absolutely delicious. However I used the suggestions that Stephanie made because they sounded so good! It worked out perfectly! The bread is very moist and delicious and has a wonderfully sweet and peanut buttery flavor. This was exactly what I was looking for!

5 stars! It came out beautifully! :) Also gets 5 stars because I replaced with all whole-wheat flour and it still turned out great (few recipes do that as well as this one did!)   So, here's what I did: Used whole wheat flour instead of white flour. Doubled the peanut butter to 2/3 cup. And about halved the brown sugar (1/2 cup or less) plus 1/4 cup honey. I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used regular milk.   Even with all those subs, it turned out AMAZING. I know some people don't like ratings with substitutions, but I love them because it helps me alter recipes to fit my whole-wheat-only diet. :-) I found other reviewer's information very helpful and am so excited about this recipe!!! Thank you for posting it here!!! It came out moist & delicious! :-)

My peanut butter loving family is in heaven! I followed other reviews and used 2/3c peanut butter and made them into muffins. They are so moist and full of peanut butter flavor! I will be making these often thanks!

This recipe is awesome. I took the advice of others and added another 1/3 cup of peanut butter (2/3 cup total). and only used 1/2 cup brown sugar. I didn't have any buttermilk but just used normal milk with great results. I made it into muffins so reduced the time baking to 15 minutes at 350. Delicious!

Made this recipe yesterday EXACTLY AS WRITTEN and if I had rated it yesterday I would have given it two or three stars - edible but not great. However today the texture has improved and the flavor is better so it deserves four stars. I might rate it five stars with double the peanut butter - but since that isn't how the recipe is written I won't rate it on that.

Good stuff! I had some left-over peanut butter and needed a snack to take to our Bible study; it was devoured immediately. The recipe makes a small thin loaf so I adjusted it about 1 3/4 times to make a nice-sized loaf. I'll be making this again soon.

I also doubled the peanut butter. Very light and not to sweet which was perfect for me. I added a pinch of cinnamon to the batter also.

Really odd and not tasty at all. It sounded like a good idea for something different. Even slathered with jelly and pretending it was a PB and J it was well odd.......

What a treat! I decreased the brown sugar to 3/4 cup increased the peanut butter to 2/3 cup and added 6 oz. chocolate chips. Makes 12 muffins bake about 50 minutes.

I really enjoyed this recipe! Counter to what some say about its lack of moisture I found it had plenty and was hard to not eat all in one day! I suggest doubling the amount of peanut butter (this may help to add moisture) called for and for those of you who love chocolate like I do add some chocolate chips.

I love this! I increased the peanut butter to about a cup and added chocolate chips then made it into muffins (12 cooked for 20 min). It was delicious. I'm definitely saving this recipe.

excellent. i did put 2/3 cup of pb as suggested by others. I cooked in a 9x5 glass pan and it cooked in a little less than 1 hour. I like to slice it heat it up and spread a little pb on top. super good and hard to resist. I only give it 4 stars because I had to change the original recipe to add more pb.

I followed the advice of previous reviewers and doubled the peanut butter and used muffin tins. I still think something is missing. Maybe a tad more salt and some mini chocolate chips? Not sure....

This bread was delicious. It was very moist and tasted best when it was warm. I only made one change to the recipe. I'm a big fan of peanut butter so I added 2/3 of peanut butter instead of 1/3. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe

This is very tasty and easy to make. I doubled the peanut butter. I would recommend using crunchy style PB for some nutty texture. Next time I think I would add some cinnamon or nutmeg or something for a little more spice flavor. I baked in mini muffin pan for 17 mins. These are great! Would think you could add nuts bananas mini chocolate chips butterscotch chips etc.

I did 2/3 cup of natural peanut butter 1/2 cup of brown sugar and used plain milk. Added chocolate chips (50 grams). The taste is good. It is moist enough. However after 45 minutes of baking it is overly baked on the outside too dark-brown and crispy. I checked it at 30 minutes and it was still raw dough on the inside but what I consider done on that outside. Then at 45 min. the loaf is overdone on the outside. Watch your baking time carefully!

This was ok. It seemed a little dry and didn't taste strongly of peanut butter.

This recipe is totally yummy. I made it with half whole wheat flour. Next time I'm going to try to replace even more of the white flour and decrease the fat a bit by replacing or leaving out the oil. I made this into 12 muffins and baked them for 20 minutes. They turned out perfect. I wonder how they'd taste with chocolate chips? Thanks Loves-to-cook!

I made this recipe tonight and it is delicious!  The bread is light and not too sweet. I used the Honey Roasted peanut butter instead of traditional, so the bread has a slight honey flavor and maybe less of a peanut butter flavor. Slightly toasted perfection with a cup of coffee!  I will definitely make this again!

Used 3/4 c Peanut  Butter, 2/3 cup brown sugar, two eggs (I think three would be better-I must be part Viennese) and a 1/4 cup extra flour, and regular milk.
  Nicely dense, just sweet enough, and excellent when toasted & topped with blackberry preserves.  
A swirl of jam/preserves after batter is in the pan before baking is what I'll try next with this.  
Otherwise it's very good, and might be even better with buttermilk.

I didn't enjoy this recipe at all. There wasn't much flavor to it and the texture wasn't appealing either. Sorry.

I love this recipe. It does not take much time to prepare and the tast is great. I made it for breakfast and put almond butter instead of peanut butter and used milk instead of buttermilk. My 2 year-old daughter that is not a big fun of cakes was asking me for more and more pieces of this one.

I made this several months ago to use up some left over buttermilk but I don't think I'll make it again. I added raisins and a bit more peanut butter than it said (so the raisins would be like jelly in a PBJ sandwich). It was kinda dry and didn't taste like peanut butter but I think the raisins made it a lot better! It was good for making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches (might as well use normal bread for that!) but most of it ended up sitting in the refrigerator for a couple weeks until I threw it away.

I thought that this recipe was slightly heavy but it tasted great toasted and it smelled even better. I used smooth peanut butter but next time I'll try crunchy or add some chopped peanuts to give it a little extra something.
