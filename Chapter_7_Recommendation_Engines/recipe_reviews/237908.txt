This recipe has been in my family for at least 60 years. My late grandmother (born 1918) prepared it for as long as my mom can remember. She passed the recipe on to my mom who has been making them since before I was born, always around Thanksgiving time. My husband jokes that this was one of the reasons he fell in love with me - he looked forward to going to my parent's for Thanksgiving each year and being able to bring a pie home! Nowadays I make them myself for him and my sons and everyone loves them. The lemon and allspice helps it stand out from the other sweet potato pies I've had. Hope you enjoy it as much as we do!

Very easy to make this was my first sweet potato pie and I've been cooking for a long time. I did use more brown sugar instead of the white it was a hit. I will be doing more for Christmas thanks.

This was my first time ever making a sweet potato pie! My hysband wanted one for New Years day & they were no where to be found in the store so I had to make my own! Great recipe! I'm not a baker, but my family loved it! I slightly altered the recipe because I forgot to buy vanilla & lemon extract so I used honey. Great substitute!
