When I made it I actually not add the grits as part of my meal, and might I say it was excellent! Very filling and definitely something I recommend!

I cheated and used instant grits since I was scaling this down and cooking for just me, but the shrimp and sausage were delicious! I think the spiciness is just right, and it is beautiful on the plate. I will have to find someone to make this for soon, because nobody else in my house will! Totally worth making anyway. I have a nice lunch ready for tomorrow.

To say that my husband loved this is an understatement!  Because it's just the 2 of us, made half.  Now I wish I had made the full recipe!
I didn't deviate from the recipe at all and it was just perfect.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the sauce that went with it was on point.  Total success!   Thanks for such a tasty recipe!
