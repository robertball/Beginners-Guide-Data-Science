This is a great pasta salad! My original intent for this recipe was for today's lunch...I started it last night and after letting the pasta chill, I added the remaining ingrediants (omitted the corn) and let chill overnight. About an hour before lunch, I pulled this out of the fridge and although it had taste, it was very dry. Per another reviewer, I added some italian dressing (just enough to dampen the pasta) and put it back in the fridge to blend and cooked an alternative lunch (lemon parmesan spaghetti) instead. I just pulled this salad out to taste-test after letting it sit with the Italian dressing addition (apprx 2 hours) and it is fantastic!! I can hardly stop eating it! The heat is "warm" (not spicy or hot) due to the chili powder but very tasty.  Love it and will continue to make again and again. Thanks Holly!

We found this salad to be a little dry, so we added some Italian dressing and fresh chopped tomatoes.  It was quite good!

My husband and I did not like this salad.  We didn't realize how much we don't like the taste of cilantro.  If I ever try it again, I will omit the cilantro.

I was SO disappointed with this recipe due to all the rave reviews!  I began this dish friday late afternoon for a Saturday party.  by Friday night it was absolutely dry and flavorless.  Fortunately I was able to save this dish by adding TONS of balsamic vinegar, garlic powder, salt and some sugar (splenda).  After these additions, and loads of italian dressing, this dish was a success.

I enjoyed this, but I had to modify a few things. I didn't have the chicken, red wine vinegar, or tomato juice on hand, so I left those out (after scaling the recipe to four servings, I really didn't miss it). For the peppers, I used a tricolor mixture of precut peppers from Trader Joe's. Good stuff, thanks.

My husband loves this recipe on hot summer days.  And he does not even like salads very well.

What a great pasta salad. This one has great color and texture. The spices added just enough of heat for me. I cooked the chicken breast outside on the grill. I took this to an office potluck and it was enjoyed by everyone.

This is a really good dish for potlucks or picnics.  Vegitarians can substitue the mock chicken recipe which uses frozen tofu. This recipe is in the vegitarian section.

Very dry, I'm thinking the addition of a pint of halfed cherry tomatoes may help. I used 2 small chicken breasts, but thought it needed more chicken.
