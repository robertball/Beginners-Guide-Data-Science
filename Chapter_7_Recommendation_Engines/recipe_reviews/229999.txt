This recipe makes the absolute best Bread Pudding on earth!  
last week we bought a big box of Krispy Cream Donuts, that my friends daughters school was selling as a fund raiser.  We are not really a fan of those donuts, but, I bought them to help out the school band.  I was so darn happy that I did.  I tore apart those donuts and used them in this recipe instead of bread.  A gigantic OMG...The absolute best we have ever eaten.  I do have one suggestion.  I made ours in a very tall bake pan.  This made the Custard part sink to the bottom and it turned out spectacular!

Without a doubt, bread pudding is my husband's favorite dessert. We are pretty good foodies and he has eaten bread pudding all over the country and probably in every restaurant in NOLA. I have made different recipes many, many times at home. I made this recipe last night. He says this is absolutely, positively the BEST he has ever eaten. I agree.
I bake my own bread but I followed the recipe exactly. I always use a butterscotch, caramel sauce with bourbon from Bon Appetite magazine. EXTRAORDINARY! This will be "the" bread pudding forever. No reason to try anything else.
Oh, did I mention, IT'S EASY!

I made this recipe last night and it is fantastic.  More custard than bread pudding but full of yummy old fashioned goodness.  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks.

I have made this several times now.  This is exactly like my Dad use to make more than 50 years ago.  His recipe too, was in his head - never written down.  I tried many other bread pudding recipes, but none had the custard in it like Dad's, until I found this one!  My husband, I, and anyone I have served it to, feel that it is the best ever!  Thank you SweetPea for submitting!!!!!!!

OMG…the holy grail of bread pudding!!!! Used leftover challah bread from my  bread machine adventures(got so lazy I just let it be a loaf instead of removing and braiding). It was sooo good kinda makes me want to add some whisky to it for a little zing. No sauce needed because it stays so moist. But again I feel the need to put liquor in this….not sure why but it is absolutely delicious as is !!!!

I wanted to try a different bread pudding from the one I usually make and decided I would make this for Christmas. I'm not sure that I like so much custard.  My mother felt the same way I did, but my sister RAVED about it.  She asked for the recipe and she can have it.  It was good...I just don't like so much custard.  I will continue to make my usual bread pudding and keep looking for something less custard-y.

Here it is - AT LAST!!!  I don't need to taste it in my mouth, my brain is doing the tasting based on ingredients. This is the same recipe my mum used ( except she did'nt have a written recipe) and I have been looking for this for a looonnnng time. I even have my sister lookingfor it. Here's what tipped me off. More custard than bread - check, raisins - check. Baked in a "slow" oven forever ( that is more than an hour at 300° ) - check. Wow! I'm going to make some tomorrow and surprise her with it! Bread pudding yay!

This is in the oven now and omg it smells delish! I followed the directions to a t but I did add some walnuts to give some texture and crunch! This is really good. I've never been a big fan of bread pudding but I had some bread that needed to be used so I thought I would give it a try and I'm so glad I did. Thank you for the great recipe!

I used raisen bread and I didn't have half & half so I substituted 2 cans evaporated milk & 1 cup lowfat milk. The best bread pudding I have ever tasted. My husband ate 1/2 of it the 1st night he tried it. It did not last long. Will definetely be a keeper.

I. Doubled the bread after I read it was really wet. The flavor was great but it was still way to wet for me.

My husband LOVES bread pudding. Me...not so much.  We had a very creamy bread pudding at a restaurant that I thoroughly enjoyed-this was very much like it.  My husband said this was the best BP he's ever had.  Didn't have 1/2 & 1/2, used whole milk & a couple Tbsps of butter as someone else suggested.  I used left over panettone (I'm Italian, hubby's German!) so I left out the raisins & I stirred in the cinnamon instead of sprinkling it on top. I cut back on the sugar as well since the panettone is sweet...hubby says 'this is a keeper' and to 'make a triple batch next time!' ;)

This recipe was a resounding success. I made it for the first time today.  The entire family,  who usually have very different palettes,  all agreed this bread pudding was delicious.  It's a keeper.

Second post on this recipe... I still love this recipe, have to change it a bit more for my own health reasons. I am using blueberries instead of raisins (lower carbs) and using baking blend Trulia for the sugar. Still use the fat free half and half and whole wheat buns. Previous post: Very good, I used fat free half and half, and 3 whole wheat hoagie buns, and 3/4 cup sugar ( to my taste ). We have drizzled this pudding with caramel sauce and added chopped walnuts. Yum! I'm going to try another reviewers ginger bread and vanilla, it sounds good. Just need to find a good gingerbread recipe. Thank you SweetPea.

This is so very good. You don't need any sauce on top. I used a couple of extra slices of bread because i wanted to use up my bread. I do not use the raisins because i want to enjoy the flavor of the custard. By the way you can use an extra egg yolk if you want.  YUMMMMM       *Update* This is my favorite bread pudding recipe. I have used Pepperidge Farm Swirl breads.  The French toast one is good as well as the Cinnamon bread. Wait until they go on sale and give it a try.

I used old cinnamon rolls instead of bread. It reminded me of what my grandmother used to make when i was little. Turned out perfectly, a little crusty on top and custardy on the bottom.

My family loved this pudding!  Next time I will make it half sweet and try 2% milk (I used 5%).  We found it a bit sweet and hubby doesn't  need the calories:)    WINNER!

This turned out great! I used coconut and soy milk as a substitute for the half-and-half, just to cut down on the dairy, and threw in a (mashed) banana just because I had a ripe one laying around. The bread pudding tasted great, and the consistency was a perfect balance of bread and custard. Will definitely make again!

This turned out amazing! I made it in my pressure cooker. Used round cake tins. I  cooked them for 15 mins using the rice setting.  I used sweet Hawaiian rolls instead of bread.

Amazing! My husband and I have been trying different bread pudding recipes and this is the one. I used 7 slices of bread because they were not thick. I sprinkled on lots of raisins and cinnamon. Will make this many times!

I didn't have croissants, but had leftover hallah bread. I stuffed it with sliced ham, turkey and Munster cheese and used the custard ingredients. Absolutely delicious!

This recipe is wonderful as is, however I tweak it a bit to make it more my taste.
I use half 1% milk & half creamer (1/2 & 1/2),  2/3 c sugar, then a 1/4 c real maple syrup.   A dash of cinnamon & nutmeg, no salt.
I had some raisin bread to use up so I lightly buttered 5 slices of it, then cut them into bite size pieces,  so no need to add raisins.

Cooked up beautifully & tastes like the comforts of home!

I didn't have half-and-half so I used 2/3 whole milk and 1/3 evaporated whole milk , plus I used 5 large eggs, and dried out(stale) cinnamon raisin bread.  I used almond extract (apparently I have a lot of it) and made it in a glass loaf pan.  After cooking it for 1 hour I covered the loaf pan with foil because the bread floated to the top and I didn't want it to get to crispy;  so I ended up getting the bottom 1/4th of the pan as custard.  It was super yummy!

I’ve used this almost exact recipe over 30 years. It came from my great Grandfather! He used a day old long loaf of french bread. And would butter both sides of the bread. He also lightly sprinkled the bread with cinnamon before adding the liquid mixture, then add some raisins. I find this way your raisins won’t sink to the bottom of the bowl.  we also use a deep Pyrex bowl / Dish so you get a nice custard ! It is my boyfriend’s absolute favorite!

Awesome recipe. I did make some modifications: 10 eggs instead of 4, full cream, lots of cinnamon instead of a pinch, half the amount of sugar (half cup instead of 1 cup), and on top of the raisins, dried plums and apricots (cut in small pieces). Because I use whole wheat bread it requires more eggs. Also really good before putting it in the oven is to let the bread soak in the mix for over an hour.

I am a bread pudding person and I have tried many recipes. This one is the best by far! I use more spices than the recipe by adding almond extract, more cinnamon and I sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top half way through baking. Excellent. Make it the day before you want to serve it and you will be surprised on the consistency as it is moist and delicious. By far the best recipes for bread pudding.

I made this exactly except for the bread. We has a loaf of bread from a bakery that we needed to use up. This is an excellent recipe. I may have used too much bread however, so it was not as custard-like but the flavor was still delicious!  This is a keeper!  Thank you for sharing!

This was delicious! My BF loved it too! The only minor change I made was to add cinnamon to the egg/milk mixture and also sprinkled it over the bread. I used 3 hoagie rolls for my bread and it turned out great. I'd make it again for sure!

My husband and I loved this. The only thing I changed was using Pepperidge Farm Raisin Bread broken up in large pieces.  I also used a few more slices, suggested by others. Other than that, it was rich and delicious!! I also used a Rum Sauce on this website that tied it in even further and sent it over the top! I loved it that way. My husband likes it with a tablespoon of Heavy cream on top! 
Fabulous! Will make it again.

OMG  I love this bread pudding SO much.  I've made it a few times since I found it here and all I can say is THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!  This reminds me of my mom's cooking.  It is a bit sweet for me so I reduced the sugar to a little less than 1 cup. Also, I recommend you break up the bread because if you leave it whole it floats on top and gets a bit crusty while cooking.

Love this recipe! I use maple flavored French toast bread and then followed it exactly. My family can’t seem to stay out of it. I’ve made it 4 times now and it turns out beautifully every time. I am wanting to change up the bread on my next batch but this seems to be so good I would hate to mess with it. I’m sure Cinnabon bread would be amazing though. Delicious!

I made this today and it is just like the one I grew up on and exactly like my Mom's recipe! I was looking everywhere for a custardy recipe and this one truly lives up to it! The custard is thick and velvety smooth with just the right amount of vanilla flavoring.  I didn't change anything in this recipe because I wanted to try the original version first and I must say there is nothing that I would change about it!   It's simple, easy to make and one of the most delicious bread pudding recipes I've tried!  So yummy tasting that I will be making this bread pudding for many years to come!

Excellent, thank you!  I did add a some artisan bread.  Everything else was as written.  Scrumptious!

I used bread from my breadmaker, it tends to go stale quickly if not used the first day, and this is a great way to use it up.  I only used 3/4 cup of sugar, and next time may reduce it to half cup.  Also, I didn't have half and half as this was a spur of the moment thing, but it was yummy with whole milk.  I made some custard to pour over.  It's also good for breakfast, kind of a baked french toast, and would work well with maple syrup for a ready to eat breakfast next day.  You could add cranberries instead of raisins and a dash of allspice and nutmeg for a holiday flavour, which I plan to do.

It was delicious!! I Used a pint and a quarter of half & half instead of quart. Used 6 leftover canned Grands Style biscuits instead of bread. Perfect tweak.

My step-daughters had never had bread pudding. It was a favorite of mine as a kid. Mama was always making bread pudding. This recipe is exceptional! I added bits of apple I had from our apple trees. I doubled the recipe and there wasn't a crumb left. I will make this time and time again.

I followed exactly except I used 9 slices of bread And added more cinnamon. I substituted chocolate chips for the raisins. My 9 year old son absolutely loved it. Definitely making this again.

The bread absorbed most of the liquid making it very  moist and delicious! There was no layer of custard, though. Most bread puddings I've made come out more dry but not this one. I halved it, and it's a perfect recipe! (As someone mentioned, a little brandy, say around the holidays, would be very nice.)

Just made this bread pudding!  Awesome is the only word to disscribe it . I've tried many. They came out dry. This is moist and luscious.  My dad took me to a diner as a child and I always got the bread pudding.  This is as close to that bread pudding as it gets. Love it, easy and awesome.

This is very yummy! After reading all the reviews I decided to go with 10 pieces of bread I used Brioche and it was fantastic. I also added a pinch of nutmeg. Will definitely be making this again. My husband and I both loved it!

This bread pudding is delicious. Beats any that I've had in restaurants. I made no changes, because you can't improve on perfection.

Delicious. It did have way too much custard for my taste so Ithe second time I made it I threw an extra 2 or 3 slices. I also cut my bread into cubes. I didn't find the full slices were as good as cubed. The reason I made it a second, a third, and my fourth is in the oven, is that the flavor and texture are outstanding. Definitely my bread pudding of choice from now on

I liked this because it wasn't so "bready" and was very quick and  easy to put together.  I made it to the recipe but I think it would be much better using stale french bread or an artisan type bread.  Thanks for sharing.
Update...husband likes more bread than this recipe calls for so I  add an extra slice or two. Great flavor.

This is an excellent bread pudding.  It was very custardy.  The next time, I make it I will try it with almond milk only because we have a family member who is lactose intolerant.  This bread pudding reminds me of the bread pudding my grand mother used to make.  I thought I would never find a recipe that is so close to her recipe.  This will be our family staple recipe.  Thank you very much.

I made this recipe for my family last night. I was going to make a double batch so I used 8 slices of bread 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 1 cup of raisins. When I put the first batch of liquid in my baking dish I found I had no more room for the second batch so I just put it in the oven with that. only baked it of 1 hour and 20 mins. and It was the best bread pudding I have ever made. I really found this recipe to be the best yet.

I like the fact that this one has lots of custard. I did add 2 more slices of bread the second time around, and it still had plenty of custard. Even my elderly father ate it, and he's usually a cake, cookies, pie sort of guy. I also added Craisins (dried cranberries) to it along with the raisins the 2nd time. It was great with both. One of my sons suggested chocolate chips. I may try it that way sometime.

Love it...it's the best of both worlds..I love custard and I love bread pudding..this is the best I've tasted...creamy, perfect balance of ingredients..have made it multiple times because it's so simple  and it disappears just as fast.

It's easy and I used ginger bread with a little extra vanilla. Smells so good
