This recipe was super easy.  In response to the negative review, I would suggest making sure the egg whites are at room temperature before beating.  I found these to be quite tasty.

It's very important to leave your eggwhites out for 1-3 days to let the moisture out and let the proteins in the eggs become stronger. Be careful not to over-mix the meringue or fold the batter too much or you'll let out all the air and ruin your macarons! Another important step is to let the macarons sit for 20 minutes or longer to let the batter harden, creating the shell.

Don't know what I did, but these turned out horribly!  Besides the texture, these tasted like dish soap (which I did not mistakenly add, LOL).  Good luck to others.

This was my first attempt at macaroons and now I am hooked. You do not want to drop these by heaping teaspoons though or you will end up with large macaroons. A piping bag would be better and then you can better control size. Room temp egg whites are a must when trying to whip them into stiff peaks.

I made these this morning, and had no problem at all.  They taste great, light and airy, and I did put the 3 egg whites into a bowl yesterday and just put them aside until today.  Will make them again!
