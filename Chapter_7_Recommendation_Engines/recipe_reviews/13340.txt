I am not a great beet lover. However, this was fantastic. It took longer to wash and dry the blender than it did to make the soup. How do you spell "scrumptious"?

Wow! I made this soup on the hottest saturday here in california. I used 1/2 a Maui Sweet onion and ate it all the soup myself. Yum!

This is a gorgeous soup.  It really needs sweet (maui) onions.  We used red onions and it was way too oniony.

I hate giving bad reviews, but as an experienced cook I just couldn't let this one get by. I put it on my dinner table and polite guests were dumping it back into the serving pot! It was mortifying!

Wow, I don't know what to say, this was really, really not good.  Neither my boyfriend or I are picky eaters at all, and we both like all of the ingredients individually; however, we poured this down the drain.  I think part of it is the color--it may be natural, but it just doesn't look like anything you want to put into your body.  After that, I'm not sure if it was the lemon or the onion (and I even cut back a bit on the onion), but something just wasn't right.

I hate to review a bad review, but sometimes (no, usually always) its warranted!  This soup tastes like you think it would, on the sour side(hello!?!?).  It doesn't have a large amount of ingredients, but lots of sour cream and lemon juice=sour! A truly "experienced" cook can modify or expand a recipe just by reading it.  I am not a chef, but read cookbooks like I read a book.  :)

I love cold soups, but usually you have to cook something then chill it.  This is so easy.  I thought it had the perfect tang from the lemon and sour cream ( I used reduced fat ) and we didn't even notice the onion ( I used half a Vidalia )  My only complaint was I didn't make enough!  Oh and in my house - real men do eat pink soup!  Thanks for a great summer recipe.

I added extra lemon juice (one whole lemon), onion, salt, lots of pepper and an entire 8 oz container of sour cream (plus extra for garnish), then added ice water until it was the right consistency  I made this as a starter for a vegetarian dinner party, and everyone LOVED it.  Delicious and simple!!  My favorite kind of recipe!!!

Good beet soup. Unless you really love onion, you might find it's best to cut down on it a bit. A couple of Tablespoons is enough to give it good flavor for our tastes. I'm surprised at the reviews who didn't like the color. Of course it will be pink. Beets aren't white.

This soup is delicious!  I used roasted beets and vidalia onion and followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fast, easy, and rich and tasty. Be sure you use a mild sweet onion since it is raw and the flavor clearly comes through.  A very gourmet looking and tasting recipe yet so so easy.  Thanks!

Incredibly delicious chilled sour soup (if you don't enjoy sour soups, skip this recipe)
I replaced the sour cream with fat free greek yogurt, added crunchy cucumber to the finished soup and garnished with feta cheese.

I love this recipe. I grew up eating beets, so I expected the beet taste and knew it would be pink. I actually enjoy it more than borscht since the beet taste comes through much more with this.

Wow, this is really good and easy.  I caramelized the onions in butter the second time I made it and it was a bit sweeter and less strong with the onion flavor.  Last time I substituted part yogurt and it reduced the calories/fat and gave it a little bit of a sour kick. Great (and healthy) way to use beets from my veggie box.  Thanks!

I ENJOYED THIS SOUP, BUT MY HUSBAND DIDN'T. HE DIDN'T LIKE IT CAUSE IT WAS PINK.  IT'S GREAT, AND COOLS YOU DOWN, WHEN YOU EAT IT. THANKS FOR SHARING.

I use a can of sliced, chilled beets, undrained.  1/4 c mild onion, 2 cups chilled chicken broth.  Blend until smooth.  Serve with dollop of sour cream & salt & pepper to taste. Sprinkle with fresh or dried dill. Yum!

Super easy to make.  Im not fond of beets, but my husband loves it.  I didn't have sour cream on hand,  so used kefir and omitted the water.  Great and super low calorie as well!
