Light and refreshing mix of textures and flavours. I was worried about the mozzarella in citrus so I ate it immediately instead of letting it sit. This serves nicely with some tortilla chips. I added some hot peppers and bean sprouts. Ceviche flavours for those of us who can't eat fish! Thank you Traceya822 for sharing your recipe. Update 28/4 I made this with tofu instead of mozzarella and it was delicious! Makes for nice vegan meal!
