I left out the oil, and cooked the potato and onion in a small amount of water with a chicken bouillion cube thrown in.  Topped up the liquid with milk and left out the cream.  Most excellent.  This is a good one for the immersion blender - with a full size blender you need TINY batches or it's likely to throw the lid off and splatter you and your kitchen with green goo.

The soup was very good.  I have just learned of the incredible nutritional value of watercress and I was trying to find ways to eat it other than on salads. This was absolutely a perfect way.  I will be making a lot of this and keeping it in the fridge.  P.S  I did make it lower fat by using non fat milk and I was still pleased with the results !!

I absolutely loved it when my host mother in France would make this soup. However, there is a MUCH easier way to make this soup than this recipe suggests. My host mother would use watercress, two potatoes, creme fraiche, salt and pepper. She would cook the vegetables in water, puree them with an immersion blender, and add creme fraiche. This is 10 times easier and healthier, and it still tastes amazing!

She would also sometimes add broccoli, a great addition.

I was looking for a non-salad recipe so I could use up that bunch of watercress and this one is a winner!  I substituted potatoes water for milk (didn't have any on hand) & added cornstarch as a thickener & love it!  I'll be making this over & over again.

This was very tasty, easy, and elegant! I made a few alterations due to a somewhat bare pantry. I only had about 1 1/2 cups of milk, so I used some extra stock (vegetable, to make it vegetarian) and about half a cup of sherry. I ate it while watching *Wilde* and found it an aesthetically worthy complement to the movie. :D

I just discovered the great nutritional aspects of watercress and this was the perfect recipe to load up on it!  I used a vegetable base stock instead of chicken to make it vegetarian.  I also added a few cloves of garlic and 2 jalapeno peppers to the onion potato mix for some extra flavor without having to add any salt.  i was delish

I was trying to figure out a quick fix for all this watercress I bought on a whim, and this worked perfectly! It's also low fat, I could just use skim milk. I might try to use less liquid and allow the watercress stock to be thicker next time for a creamier texture...it was also hard to control the blender at first, you have to start low and stay at the "mix/chop" modes for awhile.

Simple and comforting. This was a great way to use my watercress! I think the pureeing part would be easier with a stick blender, but I don't have one yet.

We found fresh watercress at a farmer's market and were looking for something to do with it.  I like anything with potatoes, so we tried this.  It was very tasty.  Watercress doesn't have much flavour, but we compensated (see below) and it was a very nice addition to dinner.

variations: we used a little more salt and pepper than was called for, and also vegetable stock (I'm vegetarian).

Good stuff! I bought some watercress on a whim and this was my very first time trying it! :) I really enjoyed this soup - the recipe doesn't really need any tweaking.  I look forward to the next time I decide to purchase some watercress!!

Very good!  Had a creamy texture, not too thick or thin.  Great flavor.  Easy to make and prepare.  Worked well to blend in my magic bullet.

I've enjoyed allrecipes for years. This is the recipe that got me to sign up so I could review it. This soup is wonderful. I added two little cloves of garlic, skipped the milk and added a little cream after I had blended it with my immersion blender. It will be going on my permanent rotation. It is that good. Thank you so much for sharing your fabulous recipe.

I'm on a 20 day parasite/body cleanse with strict instructions - no meat, soy, sugar or dairy so I used veggie stock and coconut oil, very tasty, healthy and a good dish if your diet is restricted for any reason....

I made this vegetarian with soymilk and veg broth (including a leftover Ramen Noodle packet). I got a Groupon deal of a bag of vegetables and didn't know what to do with the watercress since I've never had it.  I'll be getting it again to make this.  This was great as is, but next time, I will put aside some of the potato/onion mixture and stir it in at the end for a chunkier soup. The garlic, sherry, and thyme from the other reviewer sounds like a great idea too.

Delicious soup!  I used a pound of watercress and I think that was plenty.  That was about two bunches' worth.  I also used homogenized milk to make it more creamy tasting.

I tried this recipe about half an hour before dinner was to be served.  It's fast and simple, with a good result.  I'll probably keep this recipe for those days that I need a soup in a jiffy.  I did omit the whipped cream and fresh watercress, but it didn't subtract from the lovely taste of the nutty-bitter watercress. =)

Sounds like many of us bought watercress not knowing what to expect. I bought it to add to a green drink. Yuk. Too bitter.
I hate to waste, so I looked up recipes for soup. So glad I came upon this one.
I would have given this 5 stars, but I altered the recipe. I didn't use milk or cream, and used vegetable stock instead of chicken stock. I also added about 10 sprigs of fresh parsley.

Has anyone tried using unsweetened coconut milk. I'm sure it would really change the flavor, but would it be good?

As my family does not like onions that much I have replaced it with a leek and used fresh watercress that I grew on my windows. The soup turned out amaazing, I have just added the cream in the end and used immersion blender to make it creamy. My entire family including 11 month old baby loved it to the last spoon.

I left out the cream and didn't bother peeling the potato. Pureed it with an immersion blender and had no more watercress left to garnish it with, but it was fine this way. Tasty!

Excellent for a milchig sabbath meal as entree.  We do sour cream  or homemade creme fresh instead of whipping cream as garnish.  A good pepper y"swamp grass" instead of the one sold with roots attached is best for this recipe.  Adding a quarter tsp of white pepper in the potato water gives a fuller body.  A definite personal favorite of ours.

Pretty good base recipe. I tweaked by using less milk, more stock and added broccoli when simmering the potato-onion mixture. Used my immersion blender to make a smooth soup, and then added a bay leaf for a final simmer before serving.

I was out of milk so used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 instead. My watercress was very, very spicy and kind of horseradish flavored but this mellowed in cooking.  Very pretty and tasty soup.

Great way to enjoy watercress.  The only alteration I made was to not whip the cream but rather just add an attractive swirl of cream to the center of the soup.  Very tasty!  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  It has a hearty texture with the pureed potato in there.  I had never had watercress before this--great way to use what's in season in the spring at the farmer's market!  Love it!  Will make again.
