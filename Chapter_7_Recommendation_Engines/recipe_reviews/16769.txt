Delicious, and not too sweet. I used all of the three average-sized sweet potatoes, and didn't add the coconut. Next time I make these, I'll cut  the boiling time down to about 20 minutes, so they're not so soft.

Simple, Fast, and unbelievable taste!!  The hint of maple made me go back for seconds and thirds and gone....Very easy.  We did not use the coconut or nuts because of the baby and it was awesome!  I have never rated anything online but this was sooooo good I had too!

Sorry but unless you are hoping for something that tastes like dessert, try another recipe.  The sweet potatoes only need a little sweetener as a side dish to a main course.  The topping here tastes and looks exactly like toffee.  Way too sweet.

Easy and delicious, I served at a party and it went over quite well.  I used yams rather than sweet potatoes, walnuts instead of pecans, and skipped the coconuts.  Also, I added parsley.  I think this recipe is a bit heavy on sugar, I think it could be cut back a bit, perhaps using some oil instead?

This did not turn out sweet enough for me.  However, I liked the recipe overall.  I just added a little more butter and sugar and I baked them for an additional 30 minutes and they were great.

This is a great recipe. Very simple and easy yet very, very good. I did not put in the coconut, but I did add just alittle cinnamon. I think I will make this for thanksgiving instead of my normal sweet potato casserole. Thanks for the recipe.

I used 3 small sweet potatoes and steamed them for about 15 minutes.  I did not add the coconut.  I baked them for about 20 minutes and let them rest out of the oven, covered, for about 15 minutes1.  I stirred them b/fore serving, which nicely coated all of the potatoes.  They were delicious.  Thank you.

We love this recipe. It makes a wonderful side dish for ham. We do find it a bit sweet so it is definitely worth considering cutting back on the sugar. Also, make sure that when you boil the sweet potatoes that you take them out of the water just before they are tender. Otherwise they end up too mushy from the oven.

I used real maple syrup and left out the pecans (cuz I didn't have any). My 2 year old could care less for this. Could have been better with a pinch of salt to offset the sweetness and maybe cooked longer to thicken the sauce. I will make again because I loved it.

Simply scrumptious ... and easy.  I followed the recipe as written.  Didn't have flaked coconut, but I did have shredded organic coconut so I used that.  It was delicious.  I'll be making it again, for sure.

Liked these sweet potatoes but will make some changes next time.  I will make more sauce for it and not add in the coconut.  I love coconut normally but it added an unusual twist to this dish that just didn't seem to fit it.

Did this recipe w/o the coconut-- maple syrup provides for a complex, but not-overbearing sweetness that really makes for an amazing side dish.  Naturally sweet and delicious!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone made sure I made them again for Christmas. I don't add the pecans or the coconut though. I just stick with the maple and it works out wonderfully. Also, I like to chunk them up (large) instead of just halves. Also, it doesn't take as long for them to boil when I do that.

I made a vegan version for a friend on Thanksgiving, using margarine instead of butter.  I also used organic real maple syrup.  The flavor was great, but maybe a little boring: it just tasted like sweet potatoes with maple syrup on them.

These turned out okay, but I was dissapointed.  The potatoes just sort of sat in the glaze, which didn't turn brown, either.  Okay, but I wouldn't make again.

I was looking for a recipe that matched the way my mom cooks her sweet potatoes. This is it! Even though I bought the wrong kind of sweet potatoes (who knew they had white ones?) - it came out pretty tasty. Next time, I will probably add more brown sugar and syrup because it just didn't seem like enough. All in all, these came out good!

Husband loves these...I don't like sweet potatoes...but I can let him have them on Thanksgiving, and they remind me of my "Grango's" family holiday meals.  Thanks for the memories.

This was a great way to make sweet potatoes without having to make a huge casserole, and they are just sweet enough.  I did not add the coconut, because I didn't have any, and I was not sure about that combination for the first time with Thanksgiving company!  I will make again.

I used light Karo syrup and added a little vanilla. I also peeled the sweet potatoes and sliced them into one inch slices before boiling them. Only boil about 10 minutes or until slightly tender so they don't end up too mushy! I will definitely make this again!

My husband wanted a sweet potato casserole that wasn't mashed, so I tried this one. Came out delicious! And this is coming from a woman who doesn't like sweet potato casserole!! Per a review, I reduced the potato cooking time to 20 min and the potatoes were the perfect texture. I added just a few marshmallows and skipped the coconut. Will definitely make again!

It's better the next day! Gives the sauce time to soak into the sweet potatoes. I love with real maple syrup and topped with real cranberries, pecans, and marshmallows. I left off the coconut but would be curious to try it at some point.

I thought that this was great, My family enjoyed it even the little one who hates coconut (I didn't tell him till he was done). I added Marshmallows too.
