I love this dish specially when the spices are bumped up several notches. I changed a few ingredients: 1/2lb liver, 1lb lung, 1lb heart, 1lb spleen, 4bay leaves, 3 large onions finely chopped, 1 16oz can of stewed tomatoes, dash of parika, cayenne, and 2 jalapeno peppers.
I boil the meats in water with salt, pepper and spring onions. (the water left from boiling the meat makes a good base for Demi-Glaze).

This is a tasty dish. The texture is what is difficult for me, but the flavor is excellent. I prefer to a mince rather than cutting into pieces. Thank you for the recipe.
