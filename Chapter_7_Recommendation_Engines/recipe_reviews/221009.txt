This sauce was made for me by Candice!  She served it with her own Schiacciata alla Florentina or Italian Easter Cake.  The sauce was the perfect accompaniment to a cup of morning coffee.  Thanks for the recipe---and the idea of what to do with a sponge-type cake.  Yum!

This is a great sauce for crepes and many other dishes. I tried several orange sauce recipes on all recipes before settling on this one. It is sweet and thick with a fresh orange flavor. Others are too runny or lack real orange flavor. This one is in my favorites from here on out.

Should have made more sauce!

There is a holiday feast at my community church next week, so I asked to make the desert (for 40+ members celebrating Christmas)! I will make a pudding cake using leftover apple puree & ground "Amish Friendship Loaf". Should have asked the Fellowship Leadership to approve the â„¢Triple Sec... erg, needed to make more than 1L of Warm Orange Sauce.

Was using the recipe above alright, ah well... I used 3 cups of orange & tangerine puree, 2 cups of brown sugar, and margarine [equivalent to butter]. Maybe 2 tsp each of Ginger and cloves will give it some "zip"!

So good.  Made this today to go with crepes.  Perfect!  Definitely add the triple sec.  Made it very decadent.  Delicious!
