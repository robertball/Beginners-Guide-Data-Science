I went to 2 stores and could not find the McCormick seasoning.  I used a pesto sauce and eliminated the olive oil since it was already in the sauce.  Next time I will use more pesto for flavoring but overall it was really goo & really easy!

Very easy, very good. I accidentaly left it in the oven too long but it didn't hurt it. Basil and parsley can be used instead of the special blend they suggest using.

This was so easy and was delicious - I used pesto sauce instead of the seasoning - spread over  brie and topped with pine nuts then baked - also used 16 oz brie instead of 8 - good thing - the six of us were scraping the bottom of the dish.  Thanks!

My guests loved this. I simply used a couple of Tbs prepared pesto mixed with chopped pine nuts as the topping for one, and the other I topped with a sun dried tomato pesto with cracked black pepper to top. A few extra minutes in the oven made it perfect.

I do this without measuring the oil, garlic, pesto seasoning and pine nuts.  I leave the pepper out because that's not how I was taught to make it.  I basically just make a paste with everything and smear it all over the top of the cheese.  I do usually use one large garlic clove that I chop very finely.  I also usually use a camembert wheel instead of a brie.  I think it's even better than the brie.  I slice off the top like instructed, and it works beautifully.  I've occasionally not paid enough attention and left the cheese in a little too long.  All that ends up happening is it gets a little oozier, but no one ever cares.  It's the taste that counts with this recipe!  It's quick and easy and something I can always have the ingredients on hand to make.

I used basil pesto and just put 3 tbsp straight on top of the cheese, couldn't be easier.  Smells heavenly when cookig looks and tastes great. My oly problem was it was a little difficult to serve, I think cooking it longer 15 min would result in much easier spreading.  Overall excellent I will try again

Good and very easy to do.  Instead of the McCormick seasonings I used a spoonful of pesto and added sundried tomatoes packed in oil.  I took it to a get together and everyone loved it.  Will definitely make again.

Great recipe! If you have a hot oven though, watch out. I cooked it for the shortest time recommended and STILL had a brie lava explode when I removed it! The villagers had to run for cover. I scooped it into another dish, and it just became baked brie and pesto and pine nut DIP. No one was the wiser.

This is delicious and so easy. I couldn't find the seasoning either so I just made pesto sauce from a packet and used some of that. My 2 friends and I ate all of it. I'm making it again for an evening baby shower I'm hosting next week.

Not bad! I did the recipe exactly and it was pretty good. I think it may be better with homemade pesto but the mccormick is good also. Has a strong flavor so serve with other appetisers/foods.

this recipe was good...I used pesto in a jar and omitted the oil since it was already mixed in.  Maybe I didn't cook it long enough because it was a little hard to dip into...and yet slid off the knives we were using. All around really good...I would make it again.

I had an Italian themed dinner party and the guest raved over this appetizer.
I will definitely make it again.  It was so delicious and very easy to make.

I didn't like the taste of the pesto on the Brie.  I thought it would have been better without it and didn't look appealing for the guests either.
