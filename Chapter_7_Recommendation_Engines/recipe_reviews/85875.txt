I do a lot of vegan cooking so we try new stuff all the time.  Both my boyfriend and I liked this recipe, but I recommend a few changes.  
One: don't drain and rinse the black beans; they don't "boil" when there's no liquid in them.  Learned this the hard way, d'oh!
Two: They need spices, or they're a wee bit bland.  I added two teaspoons of chili powder, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of cumin to the artichoke/onion mix.
Three: I added a chopped red pepper in along with the onions, garlic, and artichokes.  Purely my own taste.
Four: I recommend grilling these or sauteeing them after you've assembled the burritos.  It keeps them together much better, and gives them  a little crunch (assuming you like that).

These were great. I did modify the recipe to a certain degree. I washed the beans and added a cup of water and let the cook out, once they were almost done, I added in salt, pep,garlic powder, paprika, chili powder and cumin  powder to the beans. When I cooked the artichokes I also added in green onions, jalape√±o pepper and a tomato to the artichoke mixture and I seasoned with some salt as well. I also made some cilantro lime rice for the burritos. To each burrito in addition to the beans, rice, and artichokes I added in salsa and cheese. These were great, a very good summer burrito with fresh flavors.

This was very very very good!

I did make a few alterations... I left out tomatoes and added a cup of rice and some cut up chicken breast cooked in taco seasoning. I also cooked the beans and artichokes together in a pot and mashed them up. 

Very flavorful and easy to make. Both my fiance and I loved it!
It's a wonderful starter recipe, there's lots you can add to it.

SO good!! It only took me a half hour, but I was mostly standing at the stove durning that time. I only got 3 large burritos out of it - I'll definitely double the recipe. I was surprised by how flavorful it was - it was truly delicious. I tossed some paprika into the beans and spinach in the artichokes, which was good. I also loaded on the salsa. Next time I don't think I will, because I like a dense burrito. Still, it was delicious, and really easy!

This was a great recipe- but required a couple modifications (albeit small ones) to make it perfect.  Like others, I used one pan to save on clean up. I added the diced tomato to the pan during the last few minutes of cooking.  With the diced tomato, (I used 1.5) the serving size listed here was closer to correct.  I also took the suggestion of another reviewer and grilled them on the George Foreman. I then sliced avocados and placed the slices on top of each burrito, along with a squirt of lemon juice. After that, they were so great!  My husband told me it was the best meal he'd had in a long time. Thanks for the keeper!

I love this recipe!  However I drop the garlic and the tomatoes and use a fajita seasoning on the artichokes and onions.  I put salsa and cheese into the burritos and then put them on the george foreman grill!

This was perfect for a weekday meal; easy and quick. I added scallions and used pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar.  topped them off with cilantro and plenty of spicy salsa. I will definitely be making these again.

We liked this. It could have used a little something to moisten it a bit more (salsa instead of just tomatoes, maybe), and it benefitted from a little hot sauce. We'll definitely be eating it again.

I never would have thought to put artichokes in a burrito, but these are great, and I've made them multiple times now. I don't bother waiting for the beans to become pasty -- I just throw them in the pan after I've sauteed the artichokes for a little while and cook them until they were warm. Per others' suggestions, I add some seasoning -- cumin, cayenne pepper, and red pepper flakes -- to both the artichokes and the beans. Yum!

Very tasty.  I used a mexican combo cheese mix (Cheddar, Monterey Jack, Queso Quesadilla and Asadero) but actually liked them better without the cheese.

These are good, and easy.  I made them even easier by cooking the beans until the liquid evaporated, then added the artichokes and the remaining ingredients to the same pan.  I followed the suggestion of one reviewer to use the liquid in the can, and I added garlic, onion, and chili powders as well as cumin to the mixture.  I topped the burritos with leftover canned tomato and lettuce, then wrapped up and broiled on each side until brown.  Very nice, and very filling!  Thanks for the recipe!

YUM! Mixed everything in one pot; Added some cumin and 1/2  pkg taco seasoning; Omitted onion only because I didn't have any on hand; Added 1c. cooked brown rice to stretch it further.  I'm trying to eat more vegetarian foods and this seemed "meaty."  Will def. make again!  Spices are key though...

This was a really good jumping off point. I did as many reviews suggested and added some seasonings. I also doubled most of the recipe and tripled the beans since many reviews stated that the recipe did not yield 8 servings and it didn't look like enough beans for our tastes.

First time making a vegetarian burrito and I must say I did not miss the comfort of chicken or beef that usually goes into a burrito when I make one! A light modification, I rinsed the black beans and added a cup of water before boiling the beans on high. I added red bell peppers into the artichoke mix. I grilled the burrito and it was a success! Thank you for the recipe and I will be making this again in the future!

We really liked this one! I wasn't sure if my two year old son would eat them because of the artichokes, but he ate a whole burrito by himself. These had a very unique taste, which I liked a lot. This was one of the very few meals that didn't have meat that my husband actually liked and said we could make again. Thanks for posting this recipe!

I made this dish the other night for my boyfriend after lots of frustration of filing through recipes that didn't sound appealing.  We LOVED how it turned out and it was extremely fast to make!  I followed some of the other advise from other reviews (adding 1 C of water and letting it boil out then adding cumin, paprika, garlic powder, chili powder, salt and pepper and adding all the ingredients to one pan) I also made Cilantro Lime Rice to add and it certainly kicked it up a notch along with some guacamole!!  I will definitely be making this one again!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I enjoyed this recipe a lot, especially since I love artichokes and it was decently healthy.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable.  I also added some cayenne pepper and cumin.  I think I should have added more, because there wasn't too much flavor.

These are delicious!  I add the spices to them as previous posters have mentioned to spice them up.  I've also used this filling to make quesadillas just for some variation.

Interesting combination of flavors, but I still felt there was something missing. I like vegetarian dishes, but I might try adding chicken next time.

Loved the recipe.  I upped the black beans and mixed them into the cooked artichokes.  Didn't drain one can of black beans and drained the second... simmered the beans/artichokes until the thickness I liked... added salt as well.  Definitely will be doing this again!

Very good!  I made it with wheat tortillas and 1/4 the cheese, and I included "My Favorite Mexican Rice" rice recipe in there, so I could get the burrito chain taste, and it was great!  Definitly will do again

I have made these several times now, and they are delicious! They are also very good w/ mushrooms, and I usually add some chili powder & cumin for a little spice.

My husband was not a fan, but I though this was OK. I added some extra spices suggested by other users but still seemed bland to me. I cut the beans in half and subbed white rice in as my husband doesn't care for beans much.  I think with a little tweeking this could be a keeper recipe.

Followed the directions exactly, except for frying them after they were rolled, to add some crunch.  Also instead of canned beans I made my own from scratch.  We will be making these often!

I didn't drain all the liquid off the beans because I realized they couldn't boil w/o it, so I left some liquid and they became the right consistency quickly.  Sauteeing the artichoke hearts until browned and slightly crispy was what made this over the top for me...absolutely delicious. I also used some good salsa in place of the tomatoes...yum yum. Will make these often.  Thanks!

I was kind of skeptical of this meal at first but when my husband and I tried it we were both very pleased! It is a great meal to whip up at the last minute with ingredients that I usually have on hand.

Very tasty. Simple and easy to make. Not too many ingredients to buy. I used Gruyere instead of Cheddar and added some mushrooms that I had hanging out in the fridge.

Now this was the most delicious vegetarian burrito I‚Äôve had in a long time. Even my vegetable hating husband demanded that I make seconds! It has black beans, artichoke hearts, onions, garlic, and red bell pepper. You wrap it in a flour tortilla after sprinkling it with cheddar cheese and tomato. It is then finished off by toasting it in a pan.

First off all, thank you for the recipe, I really did like it. However, I was confused on step 1: bring the beans to a boil. Does this mean I was supposed to not drain the beans as indicated in the ingredients list? Should I have added water to the beans and this was not mentioned? Should I have left the beans on heat longer and they eventually liquefy? I would be happy to give this recipe a higher rating, but following the directions as written, my beans just turned out dry and crumbly. Can you please elaborate? Thank you.

Made this filling and it was good, but then I realized I could stretch it with some other things I had on hand...I added some chopped banana pepper and a semi-hot pepper, then some rice and chicken chunks heavily seasoned with cumin--cumin and some chili pepper and sea salt. Then I added a few chopped basil leaves--delicious!  I'd heated/blistered the wheat tortillas first...and that tasted better than a room-temperature tortilla.  I will make these again and my son wolfed them down. Oh--I didn't have enough cheese...but that seemed to be ok...

These were pretty good. But it needs two cans of black beans. One can  only allowed me to make 3 borritos that begged for more beans, and left over artichokes.

I was pleasantly surprised by this.  I followed some advice in other reviews, including putting everything in one pan; I also used a potato masher to get the right consistency and made it extra healthy with whole wheat tortillas and reduced fat cheese.  My favorite tip was grilling it on the George Foreman to seal it (very important with kids).  I am in shock that my 3-year old loved this recipe; my husband said it was great, so I will definitely make it again.  Just need to get the right blend of seasonings...

This was quite interesting. I rather liked it! It has a unique flavor. I had a huge jar of artichokes from costco that I was looking to use up so this helped. I didn't want the traditional greek-style dishes for the artichokes. This totally fit the bill. We served it with a side of mexi-corn.

I spiced up the beans a lot-- garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, chili powder, and cumin. And then I did my own little twist-- I felt like the beans needed a little creamy element to complement everything, so I added in 2 TB of light cream cheese. I felt a little less guilty about that because I used only 4 oz of extra sharp cheddar. All in all, it made 10 taco-size mini burritos...still, my family extinguished them. I think it was a good idea, but I even though I used a 15 oz can of artichokes, they didn't come out as much as I would have liked. Maybe double it? Served with fresh watermelon drinks:)

I wanted to work on increasing fiber in my diet. Beans are known as a good addition to increase fiber.
I was not a black bean fan until this recipe. Nice combination. I enjoyed it. Thank you. I also make extra and freeze some as a quick lunch on the go.

I used brown basmati rice on the bottom and mixed the bean and artichoke mixture together with a can of seasoned diced tomatoes. I used "Taco Seasoning I" from this website to give it a bit more kick. I placed shredded romain lettuce on top and left out the cheese.

I have been trying to go at least one meatless meal per week since food prices went through the roof. My husband was apprehensive about this, since he is a total carnivore. But when I made this meal for him, he LOVED IT. He ate some later that same night, and munched on the leftovers at lunches and late night until they were gone. These burritos won him over to meatless night, and I have been told that I need to save the recipe and make it again! He is a member of the navy, and one of his sailor friends tried these and loved them too!

The only change I made to the original recipe was sprnkling just a little paprika in the beans.

This had so much more flavor than I expected.  I really loved it, and will definitely make it again.  The market I was at didn't have regular tortillas, so I bought roasted red pepper ones, which I thought worked out nicely.

a very simple base recipe to start with, as most people seem to like their burritos a little different. good way to start the foundation of a build your own type burrito! i added cumin in the artichokes like someone suggested as well as a few dices of tomato. i also put various onions and bell pepper, chili powder and ground red pepper in the beans. we added sour cream, cheese and salsa. will definitely use again when hosting a small gathering.

Changes: Made this for four servings instead of eight.  Like others, I found the amounts a little short; more like three servings than four.  I also added a bunch of cumin and a couple shots of chili powder to my pan (which contained the artichokes and the beans, making it a one-pan meal on other's suggestions).  Lastly, the hearts were fresh from small artichokes I'd torn down myself since I couldn't find the canned.  I'm not sure what the difference would have been, but this version was delicious and filling.  I think a hit of lemon juice and maybe some of that avacado others have suggested would make it just incredible.

Very unique & delicious! Instead of cooking beans we used refried black beans and added 1/2 to 3/4 cup salsa to a 20.5 oz. can of beans. We also used a larger can of artichokes. We assembled our burritos then warm/melted them in a 350 oven.

I thought this recipe was great. Artichokes and black beans - an unusual combination I never would have tried on my own but it was very tasty so I'm glad I did!

I modified a bit - nothing personal, I just almost never follow recipes exactly. I left out the onion and tomato, because I don't like them. I used onion powder instead and liberal amounts of chili powder and paprika, just because I put them in pretty much everything. I also combined it all in one skillet (based on another review) to reduce clean up.

I don't know if I was too heavy handed with the filling, but this only made four burritos for me. Maybe it's because I used "fajita" sized tortillas.

Great recipe!

This was a quick and filling dinner. The artichoke made this very tangy. Would try again with less in the recipe.

I didn't care for this. It had remarkably little flavor, which isn't something I'm prone to saying since I'm not into super spicy foods. I read the other reviews and decided to add some rice, which made for a nice texture. I tried adding sour cream and salsa and that made it better but it just tasted like sour cream and salsa -- not like beans or artichokes. It wasn't inedible or anything but I won't make this again.

My husband loved these, as did my 4- and 6-year olds!  I sauteed the artichokes, beans, and onions, seasoned them with paprika, cumin, and garlic powder, then added canned tomatoes.  I baked the burritos at 350 for a little while to get them crisp, then served with pico de gallo and sour cream.  Yum!

This was easy to assemble.  But I felt it lacking something.  I added some shredded lettuce for a crunch.  Solid though and a nice change.

I was skeptical.  While I love all these flavors, I wasn't sure how they would go together.  It worked out great!  I used refried black beans rather than regular black beans and green onions.  I also add sour cream and then after they were all folded up I grilled them on both side in a skillet sprayed with non-stick.  Very good, quick and simple!

I left out the onion (hubbie hates it) and the cheese to make it vegan.  I pureed the beans and boiled them down to make it a bit pasty.  Excellent!

I found this recipe through an ingredient search for black beans and artichoke hearts, since I had some on hand that I wanted to use up.  I made everything in one pan and added 1 t. cumin to the beans, then tossed it all, including a generous measure of the diced tomatoes and the 2 c. shredded cheese, with 2 or 3 cups of brown rice, since I didn't have tortillas handy.  Served with optional hot sauce alongside raw veggies with ranch dressing.  Next time I might add some chili powder.  It was good, but a little bland.  I would definitely not make this without the tomatoes.  They add a lot to the flavor.

These tasted good and were easy to make, although I used 8 8-inch burritos instead of 8 10-inch burritos and there wasn't exactly a ton of filling in them.

These were tasty!  I didn't use 2 pans as the recipe stated, otherwise I followed it as written.  Next time I make these I'll stick the filled burritos on the George Foreman as another reviewer suggested.

It was very different - I tried it with chicken, added some cumin, curry, pepper flakes, and the artichokes still had tang. I got nervous, but when I put the burrito together with cheese and sour cream and tomato, the creaminess really made the flavors work well together. I think I would cook the beans in chicken broth and it would help the flavor, but all in all it was pretty good.

The idea of artichokes gracing an old favorite sounded compelling at first - beans and artichokes, however, do not mesh well.

good recipe! needs a bit more flavor for my taste; I added chili powder & cumin to the beans. For a little extra kick, add some chopped fresh hot peppers.

This was a good quick recipe.  The only problem I had was I was not able to get the black beans to simmer or become pasty.  Next time I would cook it all in the same pan instead of trying to make it pasty and make it in two pans.  I don't think the two pans made that much difference except making more dishes.  I also added some cumin to the beans while they were cooking.  I am not sure if it was so good I would make this again.
