It's nice to have a treat that is actually nutritious. Add 1/4 cup ground flax seed for even more nutrition.

i has a bit hesitant with this recipe after reading some of the reviews, but these turned out awesome! they tasted great, without being full of sugar. i had no trouble with the cookies not sticking together like others had. everything worked out perfectly.
some of the few changes i made -- i doubled the peanut butter, doubled the banana, used bran muffin mix instead of actual oat bran(thats all the store had) and used fresh wild cranberries(next time i think i'll add a bit more then 1/2 cup)
but like i said AWESOME!!

For such healthy version of cookies the taste is not bad at all. I followed the recipe exactly, but ended up with dough, not batter-like mixture. SO I had to shape the cookies with my hands. Anyhow, they taste a bit dry, but delicious, and my 6year old eats them (I omitted cranberries). Next time I will add flour spoon by spoon to avoid the dryness.

I was looking for a healthy cookie recipe without eggs. Great find. I used canola oil instead of butter, no peanut butter but a whole banana. Added cinnamon, walnuts, flax seeds but no chocolate chips and used golden raisins instead of cranberries and these came out great! Can eat the cookie dough while making cause there are no eggs. C'est bon!

I found it very difficult to keep these cookies together.  They did not "drop by spoonfuls".  Maybe because there are no eggs?
I also agree with the 13-year old - there is "too much stuff" in these cookies.

This recipe is excellant!!!  I'm always looking for ways to satisfy my family, while meeting our nutritional needs. I've made this recipe as it appears, and also with raisins instead of cranberries.  I add the flaxseed, also.  My athletic son takes these along to events instead of eating granola bars and thinks they are awesome!

I had these ready when the kids got off the bus on their first day of school this week and they loved them!  I substituted coconut oil for the butter, used buckwheat flour for the whole wheat flour and used applesauce instead of the banana.  The kids loved the warm chocolate chips but I love that they were getting tons of protein and healthy fats and fiber!

This is our family's new all time favorite cookie recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!! Absolutely delicious!   The first time my husband made them we used oat bran. The second time, we were out of oat bran, so he substituted with regular wheat bran and it came out delicious both times. We also used sliced almonds instead of sunflower seeds (we were out of those too) which still were delish! We used reg choc chips the first time around and white choc chips the second time. We doubled the peanut butter and the banana, which made them still turn out fine, and we pressed the cookies down with a fork before baking. We might add some flax seed meal next time. Thanks for this great recipe, it's going into our family recipe scrapbook!

thought this cookies was very good but it seemed like it needed more 'dough' to keep it together.  we will definitely make it again and add something to make it stick!

I read all the reviews.This is what I did different.I used 2 tbsp of nutella and 2 tbsp of peanut butter.I left out some of the dry ingred.( approx. 3 tbsp.) to make sure the cookies held together.I toasted the sunflower seeds and I added pecans.I left out the pumpkin spice.They tasted so good.Thank you for the recipe.I had to find out some of the measurements like 5/8 cup and 1/8 cup and 1/8 tsp. Who uses measurements like that?

Wow. Love these cookies. I quadrupled the recipe but only had 1 cup of cranberries. They still turned out well. I thought that without eggs they would be dry but with the peanut butter and banana they turned out soft and chewy. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice and used 2 pinches of nutmeg and a big pinch of cinnamon. I didn't put in the oat bran (thought it might get too dry) and got a nice, slightly sticky cookie dough that I could roll into balls and flatten on the cookie sheet. Wonderful!

Delicious!! So so so good. The only changes I made were 1) I left out the sunflower seeds and 2) I used white chocolate chips. Other wise followed exactly and they were amazing. Even the hubby likes them.

After searching for a high fiber cookie that would be tolerated by my egg sensitive brother, we were happy to try this one out.  I found the cookies full of flavor and yumminess.  The only change I made was to use fresh cranberries simmered with Splenda and water until they popped.  This prevented the cookies from becoming too chewy and gave a nice occasional tartness.  The only thing I did not like about these cookies is that they were too cakey for my taste.  I will continue to make these, however, just because they are pretty guilt-free when it comes to cookies.  Overall a great recipe and thanks for sharing!

Wow!  My husband loved these cookies....and, as he said "I don't like cranberries!"  This was a fun recipe to make, but it took a lot longer to bake than the directions, and looked kind of funny when done (i'm not sure if the dough had enough liquid ingredients or maybe my bran or oats were too dry), but the cookies were delicious....and I felt really good about the ingredients.  It's great to be able to serve something with fiber, fruit, and chocolate combined!  Thanks, Hannah.

This is my kind of recipe! I only had about a tablespoon of oat bran left, so I made it up with wheat bran. Everybody loved the cookies except my 13-yr-old, who  says there's "too much stuff" in them; but that's just him. I'm definitely adding this to my favorites. I made a 2-dozen recipe and put a bit more spice in than called for (which I almost always do), and I used dark chocolate chips because I love dark chocolate.

Because of what I had I subbed 1/8 c flax seeds for the oat bran, 1 egg instead of the banana, a dash of cinnamon, and no sunflower seeds. Next time I will try grinding the flax seeds as those took a little away, but this is a really great recipe that I will definitely come back to!

These the most delicious healthy cookies I have ever tasted! I followed a couple of reviewer's advice and used ground flax seed instead of oat bran (didn't have any) and doubled the peanut butter and banana. The only thing I will do differently is leave out the cranberries if I don't have enough as I really couldn't taste them (I only put a 1/4 cup in)I am looking forward to trying them with gluten-free flour for my mom for mother's day as she is on a gluten-free, vegan diet. Oh, and for those of you complaining about the 1/8 cup measurements: 1/8 cup is 2 Tablespoons and 5/8 cups is 1/2 cup plus 2 Tablespoons.

Either need to omit the chocolate chips or half the cranberries and chocolate chips, otherwise they wont all stick.  I omitted the honey and banana and pumpkin spice and used 3 T pumpkin pie yogurt.  Also used blueberry/cherry mix flavored craisins.  People came back for 2nds and 3rds. Great!!

Soooo awesome!  I made some changes based on what I had, and to avoid consistency issues like some had.  Added ground flax, omitted oat bran (didn't have any).  Used sesame seeds instead of sunflower (again, didn't have any).  Doubled the recipe and used two cups of fresh cranberries, which I pulsed in my mini-chopper, along with the sugar, then added to the dough.  I used olive oil instead of butter and dairy free chocolate chips as I was having a dairy-free friend over to coffee.  Received with "wows" by everyone, including my mother-in-law, who dropped in unexpectedly among the chaos.  Among 3 girl friends having coffee, and our collective SEVEN children (all ages four and under, and two of us Moms are pregnant! Yes, we get stares everywhere we go.) there was not a cookie left.  Try them!  They're easy to adjust and taste great!

These are very good and I had no trouble at all getting them to stick together. I did not have sunflower seeds, so I used chopped pecans instead. Will make again!
