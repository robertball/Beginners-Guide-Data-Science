WOW! This is one of the best frostings I have ever tasted! I made it to frost a Maple Nut Cake I made last night(also found on this site) and it was truly divine. Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

this is excellent on banana pecan cakes but i would adjust the maple according to taste for those who don't care for a strong maple flavor or for those who think it doesn't taste enough like maple.

It's so interesting, after looking over some of the reviews, to see how tastebuds and preferences differ.  I'll weigh in here by declaring this frosting too sweet and too maple-y.  I added more butter, nearly another quarter cup, and wished I could take out half the maple extract - a quarter teaspoon would have been fine. I used this to frost "Maple Nut Cake," also from this site.

Excellent!  I double the maple flavor, and add a little more powdered sugar to make it stiff enough to pipe and keep the shape of whatever tip you use.

Quick, easy, and good.  The kids loved it.  I put it on pumpkin muffins and eight six year olds all had seconds.  You can't find a tougher audience than this!

I used this frosting for my chocolate cupcakes topped with maple buttercream and crumbled bacon and it was divine! I actually added more maple due to the strong chocolate and bacon flavor and it worked beautifully! I wouldn't change anything about this recipe..no worries about the 1 star rating...they must have not made it right! Kudos!

I made this frosting to go with the Maple Nut Cake, also from this site.  It was so delicious that I had to make a second batch, because the first didn't make it onto the cake!

As is, its a very sweet frosting that doesn't have much of a maple flavor.  Doesn't taste bad but definitely not a favorite.

Absolutly delicious!! I didnt have any cream, so I used a fat free whipped topping, and it turned out beautifully. Also, i didnt have any maple flavored extract, so I used maple syrup which made it runnier, but i just added more confectors sugar, and flour. it's melt in your mouth delicious!!!

This is an awesome recipe that goes incredibly well with the Fabulous Fudge Chocolate Cake from Charmaine. I actually add don't use the maple extract with that cake, but convert it this recipe to a chocolate frosting by adding 6 squares melted chocolate and 1/4-1/2 cup cocoa. I also add 1/4 cup of maple syrup to make it velvety.

I made this for spice cupcakes. I freeze them and put one each day in husbands lunch.  He loved them.  The only thing I changed was instead of maple extract I used maple syrup to taste.  It was excellent and actually doing it again today.

great flavor. best if you let thicken in fridge before frosting anything. More like a glaze consistancy.

This is a great frosting to use on a spice cake.  I used it on 'Festive Prune Cake' another AR recipe.  I did not have regular cream, but I did have International Delight â„¢ Caramel Macchiato cream, so I used it.  This is a very soft frosting, but so delicious.  I think the next time I make this; I will use that flavor of cream again.  I can see where this frosting would work on many flavors of cake; spice, banana, butter brickle, etc.

Best ever maple butter frosting!!! I used 1 Tablespoon of maple extract and added 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts, and topped a chocolate fudge brownie recipe with it. Thanks for the great recipe!!

Very nice basic frosting recipe.  I used skim milk because I was out of cream and real maple syrup.  I needed to use a little extra sugar for consistency.

This frosting tasted great on the Tollhouse Blonde Brownies that I also found on this site.  It's really yummy and I love the maple flavoring.  I did use skim milk instead of the cream because I didn't have any cream but it still came out perfect.

This was a great recipe, I used it for some spice cake cupcakes for a friend's birthday and everyone was really happy with it. To me it was kinda too sweet, therefore the 4 stars, but everyone else liked it. The original recipe made very little, I could only frost 3 cupcakes with it, so I had to make a lot more.

This frosting is great on the maple zucchini bread, but is very sweet on it's own. The bread helps tone down the sweetness. Overall it's a good frosting and I will use it again.

ok, not great.  I made it just as the receipe stated. It was very sweet and not super smooth.  I bit grainy and greasy. It was also a bit runny to pipe. I probably won't make it again.

Delicious! I, too, added an extra 1/4 cup of butter to cut the sweetness a bit, but this is really good. Will definitely make this again.

This frosting was  very good.  It had a nice thick, fluffy consistency, and tasted exactly as I had hoped.  Most importantly, I found the proportions of sugar to milk to be spot on, so the frosting was neither too stiff not too runny.

I am only rating this 4 stars because I found the maple flavor to be a bit lacking.  If you left it out though, this is a great base buttercream recipe.
