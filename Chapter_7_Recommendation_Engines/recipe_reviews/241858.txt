Easy recipe (thank you immersion blender) for a quick sweet topping for scones and pastries.  Since my family thought the sour cream taste was a bit too much (and quite honestly they wanted something sweeter), I increased the sugar to 4-5 tbsp which made it amazing. Thanks for sharing this time saver!

Nothing like real Devon cream. However it does taste good and makes a good dessert or scone topping. ( the cream I made was thinner because I used table cream since I didn't have whipping cream)
