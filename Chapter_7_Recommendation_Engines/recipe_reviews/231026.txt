Good stuff! I halved the recipe and I still have a ton of left overs! I reduced the amount of Serrano chili and cayenne pepper.  I also added a little bit of curry powder and Balti seasoning.  I threw in fresh cut up cauliflower instead of the peas.  Served over cooked jasmine rice. YUMM! Will be making again.

I've been wanting my family to start liking Indian food but they've always found the curries to be a bit strong.   This Recipe is perfect starting point.   They all loved it.   So here's my fiendish plan (as I laugh maniacally ): gradually over the next 5 years  I'll add more and more curry powder  and by the end of the 5 years they'll be begging for vindaloo!

This was delicious and even better the second day. Diced the potatoes fairly small to be same sized as the peas.  I halved it all except for the diced tomatoes and served it over basmati rice.  Look forward to making this again.

This was seriously one of the best meals I've ever made! I doubled the onion, cumin, and coriander, and tripled the garlic, cilantro, and garam masala (added 2/3 with other spices and 1/3 at the end). I used pureed tomatoes rather than chopped, and used rutabega instead of potatoes. Served over basmati rice. Eating leftovers today for lunch and practically drooling! Will make a million more times.

Very tasty.  Flavors are deep and exotic.  While I served this as intended (straight on the plate) I also stuffed some of the mixture into hollowed out small/medium zucchini's and roasted them off....really nice and filling.

Absolutely incredible flavor!  This was pure comfort food.  I used an average size can of tomatoes instead of the large can the recipe called for.  I didn't have any cilantro or peas on hand, substituted dried ginger for fresh, and this recipe was AMAZING!!!!  Served it over jasmine rice.  OH, WOW.  Simply wow.

Was great.  I had to cook it a little longer to get the potatoes tender so I added an 8 oz. can of tomatoe sauce to keep it saucy.

Very nice and easy recipe - cut it in half for smaller quantity but great taste!  I didn’t alter much - just a lot more fresh cilantro as 2 tsp is nothing!

This recipe was a surprise for us.  I have never made an Indian dish before but I knew we loved all of the ingredients this recipe called for.  Our only substitute was a red onion in place of a Spanish onion.  I also tripled the cilantro bc we love cilantro.  Even our teenage kids loved it.  Great depth of flavors.  Thank you for a great recipe.  Will definitely make again.

I made this tonight for the first time.  It was simply delicious.  I went to Trader Joe's intending to pick up naan and mango chutney.  Well, I wasn't paying attention and ended up picking up whole wheat pita instead.  It was still scrumptious.   I highly recommend it.

This recipe was super easy to make last minute!  I modified it just a tad, because I didnt have all of the ingredients that the recipe called for (I was missing the fresh ginger or cilantro, so I used powdered and dried.  And I didnt have garam masala.  So i found a recipe on here and used that to make my own.)  I served over basmati rice.  DH and my 2 year old LOVED it!  :)

Oh, my gosh! This was so good! I've been making Keema Alu with another (well-known) cookbook's recipe for years and love this dish. This recipe from Allrecipes is just as yummy. My kids say this one is not as spicy as my other recipe, which pleases one kid but not the others. We serve ours with rice, a salad, and naan. I grind my own spices, except for the garam masala, so they are really fresh. (I do this in a small coffee grinder.)  The Serrano pepper I used was ripe red.  To save time, you could use ginger paste found in the produce section. We probably eat this dish at least once every three weeks.

We really enjoyed this and will definitely make it again. I did not add a Serrano chili - none available - and I only used 1/2 tsp of cayenne - I'm a coward. Thanks for sharing. A little update - tastes even better the following day!

Very rich and thick flavour kinda' like old school hamburg helper... but Indian LOL! Lots of kids around here to fill up so none of the 'hot' ingredients went in and I added an extra onion or two, a few extra potatoes, an extra can of tomatoes, and a bit more of each spice and twice the salt. Also like 3 cups of peas probably went in. Very good flavour... love it. Will serve over Basmati made in smallish Zojirushi with 1.5 cups water to 1 cup rice ratio on brown setting, eh!

So easy. so cheap and incredibly good. Follow recipe, as is, the first time. It will be great. Then make your heat adjustments. Serve on rice (optional), but have to have a nice chutney, and popadums.
Left overs are equally good.

This is very good. I look forward to trying it the next day as I am sure it will be more tasty. I found it to be too much meat and not enough content - so I added an extra cup of peas and then a 19oz can of chickpeas to make it more substantive.

I think this is my first Indian dish with ground beef... not so common. I did increase the spices, but that was about the only personalizing. Used ginger paste as I couldn't find fresh. Cut the potatoes small as mentioned by others so it cooks more quickly. This dish doesn't quite stack up to a chicken tikka masala or veggie korma, but it is delicious comfort food and very easy to put together.

This was only okay. I did forget to put the peas in at the end so they may have added something obviously. The flavour was good, it just didn't jump out at me. I added some cheap hot sauce on my plate and that improved it.

The flavor on this was awesome! And lots of leftovers! I love spicy but my family is a bit more sensitive...left out the Serrano and halved the cayenne. I’d say that brought it between a mild to medium spice level. Served over basmati rice, and sprinkled fresh cilantro on top. Easy to make, great comfort food!!

Used 3 sweet potatoes cubed. Subbed chili pepper for 1 (4oz) can of green chopped chilies. Double all the spices at least - it was bland. Added 3 c water a little at a time to simmer phase to cook potatoes, took about 40 min to cook potatoes. Just cooked onions, beef, and all spices except garlic together at the beginning.  Left juice in tomatoes when added. Might add chickpeas next time.  Served over brown rice. Comfortably served 6. Big hit with everyone!

This was delicious. I made it as written, without the pepper as my grocery store was sold out. It came out delicious, I enjoyed the curry flavors mixed with the tomatoes. Not horribly spicy but hopefully next time with the pepper will add a kick to it.

However I would recommend microwaving your potatoes partially before adding to the skillet to cook with the rest of the ingredients. They did not come out tender as I had hoped, even after adding more sauce to completely cover them, cooking longer and following other reviewers' suggestions to cut small.

This makes for very good leftovers with some naan bread!

We absolutely love the this dish and really easy. Spice level is perfect for someone that likes medium spice. I'm not a huge fan go chunks of tomato so i used crushed tomatoes instead of diced.

I love this recipe and it is flexible. I usually do my larger batch mild and then I add based on how I use it. Sometimes it's just with basmati rice. Sometimes I like it with my eggs in the morning. Great on tostadas. I keep it prepped in my freezer for days when I need some protein and have no time.

Excellent flavor.  Made almost exactly as written except I shortened each stage of cooking by about 5 minutes, and added  1/4 cup of water with the peas.  Served with Raita it's delicious. Will make again.

I made the full recipe for a dinner party, but I left out the Serrano chile and cilantro, due to the taste preferences of my friends. Per one reviewer's recommendation, I added in garbanzo beans, and they added a delicious flavor and a nice contrast to the other ingredients' textures. I also used local grass-fed beef, and the dish was a big hit. My family and friends loved it, so I'll definitely be making it again. Excellent for leftovers!

I cooked the potato and tomato together for a few minutes ahead of mixing it with the meat. It was DELICIOUS! The kids loved it, so did the hubs...a total win.

This was very  tasty! Next time, I would chop the potatoes smaller than 1/2 inch cubes so that they  will cook faster and blend into this dish even better.

Fabulous.  I doubled the potatoes, and made sure to cut them very small so they were able to cook through.  Will definitely make again.

Overall, very easy to make and delicious! I halved the recipe and made nearly as written (omitted the serrano because I didn't have it on hand), but felt the dish could use more tomatoes/sauce. When reheating the next day, I added a 14 oz can diced tomatoes (low sodium, unseasoned) and we loved the dish even more. I'm not sure if this should be on the drier side or not, but would want more moisture if I served it with Naan, but I served it with Indian Saffron Rice (from this site) and we truly enjoyed the flavors of this dish! Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I really liked the flavor of this dish, but the cook times were all off. Onions/beef didn't need as much time, potatoes needed WAY more time. I would add the potatoes much earlier, or parboil them. But with that said, yummy!

Excellent!! Such an easy one-pot, allergy-friendly meal! I only substituted spices i didnt have with me on vacation. I omitted the onions (migraines); Instead of the cayenne I used chili powder; Instead of the turmeric I used paprika; Instead of the garam masala I used Penzeys Balti seasoning; and I garnished with cashews, because why not?? If I make for company I could stretch it further by serving over rice, as some have suggested. But I love it and will make it again!!

Wow I guess Meatetarian really does like meat! 2 lbs. of ground beef and 3 potatoes?? I used less then a  pound of the meat and used about 5 red potatoes (not peeled). Other then that I stuck to the recipe but I did add cauliflower since I had a lot of it, and 1 chopped carrot. I didn't want just a "meat and potatoes" dish.
Husband and I both liked it but we thought it had too much cumin. He's not a fan of it so next time I'll add just a dash of it.  I did use more spices then it called for.  I will make it again.

I went crazy over this dish after making it! This was my first attempt at making any Indian dish and this was a simply/delicious enough dish to get my feet wet. I'm usually pretty wimpy when it comes to heat/spicy, but this one had just enough with the serrano pepper, selantro, and chili powder to give it a kick, but still be enjoyable. My only regret is that I didn't get more naan to scope it up with. Can't wait to try my hand and some more Indian dishes!!!!!

I left out both types of peppers because my family is wimpy. I thought it was great even without them. I subbed green beans for peas too, out of preference.

I never really measure anything. But I did use all the ingredients, including the Garam masala, which was pretty hard to find in my small city (I got lucky), and it was a total hit. I served it with couscous and have tons left over. I LOVE Indian food and how bursting in flavor this meal was. Thank you so much for sharing!

I love this recipe! I left out the cayenne for my 6 year old grand daughter, she loved it! We put a little hot sauce on ours.I made mine in the crock pot.  It tastes even better the next day. I used the leftovers for meat pie filling. Will definitely make this again!

I added quite a bit more garam masala, but no  other changes, and it was DELICIOUS.  Froze a portion because we're a small family, and it was one of those things we were happily anticipating eating again.

It was pretty good, but definitely makes a lot of leftovers, enough for two people the next day.

Found it took longer to cook the potatoes, maybe an additional 10 minutes. Made with basmati rice and parathas.

This is a tasty combination. Next time I'll microwave the potatoes for a few minutes first so they cook faster. I had to cook this much longer than the recipe time to get the potatoes to an edible stage. I added a bit of beef broth during the process. I'd probably double the spices next time too as we like things spicy.

This was delicious. Rather easy and full of flavor. I followed the recipe, minus the serrano pepper because I didn't have one, and only had a bit over a pound of ground beef, and the 15 oz can of diced tomatoes. I still have leftovers, which makes me happy.  Excellent. I will make this again.

Was soooo good . If you aren't big on spicy foods you might want to hold back a little on the cayenne pepper.  I made as written and it was delicious. Just myright for my family but we like our food spicy.

Easy recipe to make, tasted fabulous, and the leftovers are a great lunch the next day. My only change was eliminating the Serrano and halving the cayenne, since I am a lightweight when it comes to heat. It gave me the Indian food flavors I was craving, without having to worry about what a restaurant considered "mildly" spicy. Great first venture into making this genre of food at home. Thanks for posting the recipe, Meataterian!

I was really happy with this recipe. I left out the serrano chili pepper because it would've been too spicy for my kids but it still had a little bite to it. I'll definitely be making this again!

Loved it! Made it as per the recipe, served on white rice with na'an. Great flavor but not too spicy. Delicious, easy and relatively quick. Will be having this again soon I'm sure.

This is a simple, hearty recipe with tasty Indian flavors. I made a half batch and it's about 5-6 servings when eaten over rice. Instead of trying to halve a serrano pepper, I just left it out and put in the full recipe's amount of cayenne pepper. To me, beef was an odd choice of meat for these flavors, but maybe just because I usually have chicken or vegetarian Indian food.

It's a good dish to try if you're looking for something different. I omitted the serrano pepper and halved the cayenne because I don't like spicy. I added 1 tbsp of curry powder. As another user mentioned, the potatoes took about 40 minutes to cook rather than 15. I served over basmati rice. I was happy with the outcome, the boyfriend loved it.

Great tasting!  I always make the first version per the recipe before adjusting to our family preferences—next time I will add more of the spices in the same ratio since we prefer spicy dishes.

This was pretty good! I mostly stuck to the recipe. Used white and sweet potato and canned low-sodium peas. Also left out the salt. The spices made this really flavorful without having to add extra salt. I’ll make this again but will I crease the amount of spices and add curry powder.

I, too doubled the spices, except the ginger I only used a heaping teaspoon. Used 1/4 of a jalapeno pepper I had lying around, added a teaspoon of curry powder and a dash of more garlic and onion powder. My potatoes went moldy and I ended up substituting the potatoes with garbanzo beans...so it's more just Keema with some spices and beans!  Served over Jamsine rice. Can't wait to try it with the potatoes!

I had a chuckle when I saw the submitter of this recipe "the meatatarian", as this recipe was far too "meat-heavy" for us! Good flavour, but I doubled the spices (except cayenne), perhaps because I added lots more veg - DOUBLED the tomatoes & peas, added a few cups of chopped cauliflower, a can of chickpeas, an extra potato, 2 chopped celery stalks.   These veg additions made it a one dish meal.  As written, it was 3 stars, with my changes, we loved it!  Good starting point, make your own personal changes to suit your taste.

I added another can of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce since I was serving over rice and wanted it juicy (adjusted amount of spices to taste since I was adding more diced tomatoes ). The family loves cilantro so I used 1 cup of fresh cilantro and ended up adding some dried cilantro to taste while making adjustments for spices. The family enjoyed it and it is very inexpensive to make since I already had most of the spices needed and super easy.

I lowered the portion size to 2 and it was a lot of food, still. I would use a small russet potato and maybe less ground beef. I used a little more than suggested tomatoes and poured the juice in, too. I didn't have a pepper so it was a little lacking in spice and flavor, so I just added more of each spice. It was very good and didn't take the full allotted time to make!

My wife and I love Indian food but it is always too spicy. I made this dish and omitted the serrano chile pepper and only put a very small pinch of cayenne pepper in and the flavor was GREAT. The seasoning combination was delicious thank you for sharing this recipe!!!!!!

2 lbs. of beef and 3 potatoes makes a dish that's just a bunch of beef and not much else (unless maybe you use russets?).

Try 4-5 red or yellow potatoes and 1 lb of ground beef.  

Otherwise I liked the dish.

I was excited to stumble upon this recipe recently and couldn't wait to try it. The family loved it! Instead of only green peas I used frozen mixed veggies that included corn, green beans, green peas and carrots. I served with naan from Aldi and everyone was happy! I will definitely make it again! 

*Also, I cut this recipe in half and still had tons of leftovers after our family of 4 ate.

This is comfort food.  Wonderful blend of spices and textures.   My changes are minor - I add some hot peppers because we like a bit of heat and cut the potatoes into small pieces to reduce cooking time.

Comfort food, it didn't smell good until everything was added in and it is even better the next day. My fridge smells amazing from the leftovers! I didn't have Serrano chilies so I used canned green chilies, I also didn't add potatoes and instead served it with steamed sweet potatoes and a side of quinoa. My kids really enjoyed it too.

It was delicious! 

This makes a LOT of food (to be fair, I think I added more potatoes than the recipe asked for), so if you're making it for only 1-2 people and don't want a lot of leftovers, consider halving the recipe. 

I'm totally saving this and making it again!

Amazing! Not too spicy as I cut out some chilis and substituted chili powder, but just like I like it! I also added some curry powder as someone suggested. I'd also allow for more time to cook the potatoes as they were a little hard, but it still was a delicious meal!

Loved this recipe, I cut it in half and used cauliflower instead of peas. This has so much depth of flavor.  I added extra garlic, coriander, salt and cayenne  to fit what i wanted but you need to try it!

Yum. I was nervous this would be too spicy for my picky teen so I used full pepper and 1/4 tsp Cayenne. The flavors came together nicely without being hot. Will try 1/2tsp next time. Weirdly I had to cook potatoes MUCH longer (30-45 min?) and I diced them small. So added 1/2 cup water. Worth the wait! Served over Jasmine rice.

Well the 4 stars is a mark between what I give it which would be a 3 and my family that would be a 5. I guess there is nothing wrong with it but it is not for me flavour wise and not a huge fan of potatoes so, but for the rest of my family it was a massive hit so you can listen to them or to me.

Yay! Finally something new to make with ground beef.  Everyone in my family loved it.  I used 50/50 Garam Masala seasoning/Curry instead of straight curry.  It was so great.  Will definitely be making this again.

This was tasty.  I’m only giving 4 stars because I felt it was a bit too dry and needed more sauciness.  I couldn’t locate the Garam Masala at my local grocery store so I substituted with Thai green curry paste which added amazing flavor.  Also, I can’t have potatoes so I substituted with large carrot chunks and that was perfect and texture matched.  I will definitely make this again.

For my dish i used ground chicken. My main complaint is the dish was Not very spicy. I doubled down on all the spices including the garlic and chili peppers. The canned tomatoes drown out a lot of the spice. I would recommend eliminating canned tomatoes and cut up a very small amount of fresh tomato instead if you really want the tomato flavor. As others suggested, definitely cook the potatoes in the microwave before you add them to the dish. That being said, the dish has a lot of potential if you play around with it. This is definitely a good starting recipe.

It was okay. I'm not sure that I'd make it again. I think the texture of the meat after being cooked for so long is what bothered me about this dish. If I were to make it again, I'd use the same spices but change how I cook everything so the texture is better. Not bad for a change of pace and new flavor profile to play with.

This was excellent! Halved the recipe for two people. I would point out though that it's likely more of a Pakistani dish as it includes beef, which is not frequently found in traditional Indian dishes.

I've made this several times and my rating is based on the original recipe. Tonight, though, I was stuck with only a pound of ground turkey, no potatoes, a small butternut squash, cooked quinoa, and a lot of kale. I followed the basic recipe regarding spices, but halved them due to less meat and a family who needs mild spices only. I also put the spices in sooner, when the meat is browning. I used the full 28oz can of tomatoes. Cut the butternut squash up super tiny and substituted it for the potatoes. It still took 40 minutes instead of 20. Added the kale at the same time. Added the cooked quinoa (abt 1-1/2c) right at the end. Absolutely. Spectacular.

Absolutely delicious! So flavorful with the ginger! Had to cook the potatoes much longer than called for. The only alterations I made were these: I used only 1 pound of ground beef and added 1 can garbanzo beans and 2-3 chopped carrots! It was really great with the beans. I left out the chile pepper (only because I forgot to buy one!) Also, I cut the cayenne in half, and only put in a half teaspoon and it still had a good amount of heat! Love this recipe!!!

This was very good, I loved the spices and it has a nice flavor.  I only put in 1.25 lbs of beef and even that was too much for me.  I added cauliflower and it was delicious.  I would like to try a vegetarian version of this, or maybe just put in half a pound of beef next time.  I think ground turkey would be a good option too.

I attempted to make it as the original recipe states however, I was out of cayenne pepper.  My only substitution was 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes in place of the cayenne.  Other than that I followed the recipe to the T.  I used russet potatoes and cut them into 1/2 inch cubes and it took them over 45 minutes to become tender enough to eat.
  With that said I must say I enjoyed this dish.  I wanted to try something with Garam Masala (GM) in it only because I've heard that the GM spice is very tasty.  I knew GM contained Cinnamon and I'm not a big fan of savory dishes with cinnamon, but I wanted to try it.  I'm glad I did.  The flavors from the dish were awesome and the cinnamon was complemented quite nicely by the tomatoes and the red pepper flakes.  I have leftovers and that's what I'm looking forward to eating tonight!  This dish is a winner!!

This is a very flavorful dish , even when toned down a bit from the spicy heat of the serrano chili.  I omitted the chili (didn't have one on hand) and still found this dish to be full of complex and pleasing flavors.  Why not 5 stars? It didn't have much of a sauce base.  What liquid there was was quickly absorbed by the potatoes.  I added some liquid (about a cup of water), when steaming the potatoes (I couldn't understand how they were meant to steam properly without more liquid than there was in my dutch oven.)  I plan to make this recipe again, but I have to come up with a better plan for more of a sauce. If any readers have suggestions, I would love to get them.

This turned out great! I had to make the following modifications: omitted all tomato, omitted cayenne, replaced the chilli with a jalapeño, added 1 cup chopped carrot (same time as potato), and added 1/2 cup homemade chicken stock (to replace the moisture from tomatoes). This turned out amazing, my family requested I make it again next week.

yummmy. I doubled the cumin, was a little more generous with the garlic and ginger, a little less generous with the hot pepper, I added one grated parsnip with the potatoes and added a 1/2 cup of sour cream at the end.

Family enjoyed very much.  Made as is with one addition - Curry Powder, and two substitutions - Green Beans and spinach in place of peas and potatoes-just didn't have them.  Will definitely make again.  Added to my arsenal.

I replaced the potatoes with some zucchini I had. Turned out great, and low carb. I didn't use corriander  and added turmeric for color. I also used 1 lb. beef and 1 lb. pork. I add spices to taste so I'm not sure if I used less or more than in the recipe. Nice combination of flavors though.

Pretty much made this recipe as directed. Nice blend of spices and herbs for a delicious Indian flavor. By precooking the potatoes a bit, the cooking time for the dish was perfect. Halved the recipe and there were no leftovers...that say's a lot!

I was concerned this wouldn't be flavourful or spicy enough after reading the other reviews - some people felt the need to double the spices. But I made it exactly as in the recipe (with an additional teaspoon of curry powder) and it turned out AMAZING. Exactly like home cooked food, I was so happy. It did take a lot longer than 15 minutes for the potatoes - I had to leave it on for about 40-45 minutes. So pre-boil them a bit if you don't have that kinda time.

I made this tonight and my family enjoyed it. I expected to be spicier but it was just right with a glass of milk. I added carrots with my onions because I had them on hand. I had 3 pounds of ground beef so I increased everything to match. I will be making this again. it is definitely something different to make with ground beef!

Delicious and easy.  I made 1/2 recipe using ground turkey instead of ground beef.  I also omitted the Serrano chili as I did not have one available.  Got rave reviews and will definitely keep this recipe.

Always a hit. I double all of the spices except for the cayenne to make it extra flavorful but otherwise perfect.  Even excellent with bottled spices if you don't have fresh.

This was really good and I will definitely make it again. The only change I needed to make was to use ground turkey instead of the beef. It was great and I would think be equally as tasty with the beef. I served this over basmati rice and sprinkled fresh chopped cilantro over each serving. This was also great the next day.

Delicious!  I substituted curry for the garam masala that was missing from my spice rack. I cut back a bit on the cayenne, and tasted the serrano before I add it. It was a fairly mild one. I thought the finished dish had the perfect heat. This recipe would be good with ground lamb, too. My family thought we didn't even need rice. The potatoes were enough to make it feel like a complete meal.

It dish was so yummy. I didn't have turmeric and masala and It was just fine without it. Instead of green peas I added chopped fresh Kale. I also used a can of basil, oregano and garlic diced tomato which I think added to the flavor. This dish actually reminded me of something my mom makes and she adds quail eggs to it so next time I might just do that too.

This was surprisingly delicious. We ordered Indian takeout from a highly-rated restaurant a few weeks ago and honestly this was just as good. I had a little less meat than the recipe called for so I increased the potatoes and peas, and added about a cup of water to compensate for the increased potatoes. I did not have garam masala so I used a recipe from this site to make my own, and I had everything but the cardamom for that. I omitted the serrano chili and reduced the cayenne pepper to make it more suitable for my toddlers, and everyone loved it. As other posters have said, this was even better reheated the next day.  Oh, I was also out of olive oil so I substituted coconut oil, and that worked just fine. Really a terrific recipe that uses ordinary ingredients in an un-boring way. Will definitely make this again and again. I am hoping it doubles and triples easily for company.

Family loved this.  I could not find garam masala, so I used  Tiki masala instead.  I dont like anise so it worked out pretty good for me.  I loved all the flavor and I served this on top of  Jasmine rice with a side of tomato, cucumber, onion, olive oil, lemon juice,  and salt salad  and a side of plain yogurt.  Wonderful!

Tweaked this recipe a lot since I didn't have coriander or cilantro or tumeric. Still tasted great by substituting different curries. My kids loved it! Served with some jasmine rice. Very simple and the house smelled wonderful.

Easy dish that came out pretty good. I halved the recipe but kept the same amount of spices and it still could have used a bit more. All in all tasty! Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.

a very simple dish to put together, not time consuming at all. i went exactly by the original recipe and my family felt it had great flavor. just what i needed in terms of a fast and easy meal that i can prepare after a long day at work.

I love to try food from different cultures and I must say, that this is the BEST Indian recipe I have come across! I've made it twice so far and will def make it again!

I used spray-on coconut oil that I bought from Trader Joe's to saute the onions in my attempt to make it a little less oily/fattening (I Knew the ground beef would yield a lot of oil and fat). I didn't have a pepper or peas but it came out delicious. It's a nice hearty meal for a cold day. Make sure you cut the potatoes small so they can cook faster.

Made it pretty much according to the recipe, and it was fantastic. Definitely something we will make again and again.

Really easy, delicious and quick. I chose to cook the onions for about half the time suggested in the recipe. That's just a personal preference and in my opinion didn't detract from the meal. My housemate agreed it is on the repeat list.

Wonderful flavors!  I will add extra cayenned next time, because I love my Indian food spicy, but otherwise am satisfied with the great meal!  I served over brown basmati rice with pita.  Thanks!
