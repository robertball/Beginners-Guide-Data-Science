My husband just loved this recipe, Nagako. He doesn't much care for onions, though...so I only used one. I doubled the mushrooms, lemon juice & white wine. I also added 1 extra clove of garlic, a pinch each of parsley and rosemary and then 2 fresh snipped basil leaves at the end. I only thickened the sauce slightly, as we wanted enough to spread over rice. Served this with fresh steamed green beans, as well.

Oh my this was super tasty and fast.  I did make some changes after reading other reviews.  I doubled the liquid, (wine and lemon juice), used an 8 oz. pkg. of baby bella mushrooms, chopped in half for a deeper flavor and more texture, added a little butter to the olive oil, and probably 6-8 garlic cloves.  Also threw in a good quarter cup of fresh chopped basil leaves, and finished with a fresh chopped tomato just before serving.  This is a quality, healthy dish with deep flavor.  By doubling the liquid, the cornstarch thickening was minimal - just enough to keep it from being watery.  Served it over whole wheat cous cous cooked in salt free broth, and garden fresh green beans.  The little leftovers from lunch today were even better.  A real keeper.

After cooking the fish with the sauce, you have to make and cook another newer and fresher sauce that you can pour on the fish so that the sauce will not be dark and overdone.  The fish will taste better.

This was an "okay" dinner served over whole wheat couscous and some homemade tartar sauce. I *did* add about two tablespoons of butter to the final sauce to enrichen it with flavor - even so, I don't think I will keep it in rotation at our house.

My husband thought this was great, I however thought it was just OK.  I probably won't make this again unless he asks for it.  It just didn't have enough flavor.

It was very good.  Changed it up a bit.  Not a huge onion fan, so I only used a medium sized onion and lots more mushrooms.  I also tripled the wine, lemon and water.  It still wasn't saucy enough.  Added more flavor with the Salt and Pepper as well with Extra Spicy Mrs. Dash. Served it over Calrose rice along with a salad.  My adult son and husband loved it.

One point of confusion: if we are flipping & seasoning the "other side" of the Mahi, but there is skin on that side...  Our solution, flip the Mahi, then peel the skin. As it was soaking in the sauce, it was a very easy task with a sharp tong.  I followed this recipe exactly and served it over basmati rice, which was the trick!  The moist rice offset the fish so nicely. I will follow others' advice next time & double the sauce AND add more white wine, because our leftovers were a bit dry (though flavorful).  Even the kids cleared their plates with this recipe.  Next time Mahi is on sale, back to this recipe!  Excellent!

This one is a keeper for me. I had to adapt to the ingredients I had on hand which is certainly not my style. I used chicken broth instead of white wine & rice vinegar instead of lemon juice. Only had about about 1/2 cup of onions & sliced baby bella mushrooms. The sauce was delicious & pleasant change from my collection of fish recipes.

My husband and I both thought this recipe lacked any real flavor.  His comment was that, while the dish wasn't offensive, it was kind of a waste of good mahi mahi.  We won't make this one again.  Sorry!

This was DELICIOUS! and very easy and not a lot of preparation mess. Great flavor. I also added more white wine, a little over 1/2 cup and skipped the cornstarch. I served it with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes, a great compliment to the sauce. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

We were excited to cook the mahi mahi my husband caught in Florida and brought back home. This recipe rivals the restaurants in Key West. Great flavor. I served it over pearled couscous, and added spinach. I am going to make this for company next time. I will double the sauce ingredients. I did shorten the cooking time on the fish to 4 minutes the first side and 3 minutes the second, and it was perfectly cooked. This one is a keeper!

I used portobello mushrooms and had no cornstarch, but this still turned out quite nicely.  I would strongly recommend doubling the recipe for the sauce.  Additionally, as I had no cornstarch, I used a bit of flour and about a tablespoon of heavy cream. Wow! Fantastic.

This recipe is fantastic! I used lime juice instead of lemon juice, and added a little more white wine than was called for, and it turned out great. I also added a little bit of cilantro which went well with the lime flavor. We loved it, and will definitely make again!

I tried this using shallots and ahi. I thought the sauce was very tasty, but it wasn't the best pairing with ahi. I will try it again on a different type of fish or meat.

The recipe was simple to make and had easy ingredients that I had on hand, but even following the recipe exactly as is, both my husband and I thought it was fairly bland.  In addition Mahi Mahi typically has a very good flavor, and the onions overpowered the flavor somewhat - and we are huge onion and garlic fans! My husband and I rate recipes 1-10 (10=best), and we only keep recipes to repeat if they are 8 or above.  This one rated a 7 to a 7 1/2, so we will only remake it if it's the only ingredients we have in the fridge for a white fish preparation!

Very easy and tasty but you had better love onions & garlic.  If I make it again I will cut onions & Garkic in half.

This was good! I impulsively bought a bag of mahi mahi fillets without thinking of how I would use them. I wasn't sure what to do when I started looking up recipes and saw that most of them were sweet and fruity (lime, pineapple, etc), which I knew my boyfriend would never eat. Then I found this savory alternative! I might tinker with it a little because we thought it could stand to be a little more flavorful, but I'll definitely be trying it again!

Was very surprised by this recipe.  It was very good.  To those who 'dissed' it, they must not have followed it correctly.  The people who added things to it, are probably correct, and I'm sure it really improved the dish.   I now wish I had done the same.   Worth making.

I thought this mahi mahi recipe was delicious! I thought it had tons of flavor! I did double the lemon juice and white wine. I also skipped the cornstarch and water entirely. Thanks for giving us something different for dinner!

It was easy to make and I had all the ingredients in my kitchen, but the recipe was just ok.  Next time I would only use 2 onions and an entire package of mushrooms.  Also, I would add more garlic and lemon juice.

This was very good. I added a tiny bit of soy sauce, bay leaves, an parsley to this and more water and corn starch. The fish especially came out very tender and delicious - the sauce was good as well.

This was probably the easiest fish recipe I've ever done ... my hubby usually does the fish cooking in our house.  We absolutely LOVED this dish!  A definite do-again for us!  We served it along with steamed peas and hubby's "dirty rice".  We drank the rest of the bottle of white wine used in the sauce along with the meal.  AWESOME!

I changed this just a little we all loved it. I had no white wine so I used my white wine vinegar and omitted the lemon juice. This was our first time eating Mahi-Mahi and we will do it again. Thanks to all recipes I found out a great way to cook this excellent fish.

I lightly coated the fish with cornflour, salt and pepper and cooked it first, 3/4 if the way through. I then pulled the fish out and kept it warm. I then added a bit more oil, onions, garlic and mushrooms. Sautéed until brown. Deglazed the pan with the wine and lemon juice. Cooked down slightly and added fish back to pan. Served with potatoes and green beans. Very yummy!

Only changes I made.. I doubled the white wine and I added a cube of chicken bouillon.. I also cook the fish in a separate pan  so the sauce  didn't get fishy. Turned out great

Not impressed. Mahi Mahi is a light and flaky fish, it was all wrong with the onions and mushrooms. Not only did the mushrooms not jive with the fish it had very little flavor.

Found this tonight when looking for a new way to cook Mahi Mahi--I had no mushrooms, but had 4 chipotle peppers so decided to substitute.  It was fantastic!  Very spicy in a nice way.  Used Pinot Grigio for the wine and chilled the rest until dinner.  Everyone scraped their plate clean.  Served on top of Basmati rice--very good with the sauce.

My husband and I really liked this fish.  I did use too much pepper so it was hot. My son tried the left overs and he enjoyed it.  We will make again.

Great flavors!   Next time I will cut way back on the corn starch or skip it completely.   I would have preferred the sauce to be thinner.

I'm giving 3 starts... could be 4. The dish was quick, easy and tasted good. However, was not visually appealing at all. Very monochromanic and a little unappetizing?

THIS WAS GOOD BUT MY SAUCE WAS A BIT THICK. NEXT TIME I WILL ADD MORE WINE AND LEMON JUICE.

Really not the best, but quick and easy to make in a pinch - I thought I had purchased a bag of Costco frozen salmon and took it out to thaw this afternoon and THEN saw that what I had was Mahi Mahi.  I added some butter at the end as one reviewer suggested and decided this was needed even though I'd prefer to save my calories.  Next time, I think I'm going to add Taco seasoning instead of salt/pepper and lime juice instead of lemon and make the rest of my mahi mahi into fish tacos!  Thanks for helping me out tonight!  Kim

This recipe was easy to make, but it didn't have much depth of flavor. The sauce just tastes like onions. We may try it again and add some fresh herbs.

I took the advice of reduced garlic and I increased the mushrooms because we love them so much.  This is definitely not an attractive dish but we loved it.  Will make this again for sure!
