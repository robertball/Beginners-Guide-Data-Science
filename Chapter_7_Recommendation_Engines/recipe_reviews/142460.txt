It's hard to believe this wonderful drink has apparently been ignored for four years!  I make blended drinks often and have tried many, but there are none in my memory we've enjoyed as much as this one. Interestingly, this evoked profound and pleasant memories for Hubs of a drink he's been racking his brain all day to recall. In any case, this "Orangemade" reminded him of something very delicious he's had before.  It is delightfully sweet and citrusy (I cut back on the "sugar" to 1 cup), frosty cold and instantly refreshing and thirst-quenching. And the bonus is that since I used Stevia instead of sugar (Splenda is equally as good) it's a low cal, no sugar, hydrating glass of Vitamin C.  Excellent. I wish I would have known in advance just how much we were going to enjoy this - I would have made more than I did.

Had to substitute pine/orange/banana juice so reduced sugar to 1/2 cup, along with the 1/2 cup fresh squeezed lemon juice - not too sweet, not too tart - just refreshingly delicious! Can't wait to try it as written! Thanks AnaLena!!!

In a word, FANTASTIC!  I used orange juice from the grocery store but used fresh lemon juice (3 lemons), and substituted 1 cup of Splenda for the sugar.  This was an incredibly yummy breakfast smoothie which definitely had the "wow" factor.  Thanks AnaLena for a delicious new recipe...going into my Favorites folder.

Yum, yum, yum! I read another review and thought that I would decrease the sugar as well. What I did was halve the recipe and used 1/4 white sugar and 6 packets of the "pink stuff" to lower the calories. That is equivalent to 1/2 cup sugar. It was plenty sweet enough for me. I used store bought "premium" OJ and fresh squeezed lemon juice. This is a really delicious, refreshing drink and I will definately make it again!

This recipe is very sweet. I was quite disappointed in the way it turned out. Even my kids who love sugar said it was too sugary. Won't be making this again

This was pretty tasty. I made it exactly as written. I'm never entirely sure whether measuring "2 cups ice cubes" is by weight or by volume, but since this was supposed to be slushy, I went by weight (i.e., a pound of ice cubes). It turned out maybe a little too thick, but nice and slushy. Not a very healthy drink, though - lots of sugar! I didn't drink it all the first day, so of course when I had the rest the next day, it was all melted and just liquid by then. At that point, I noticed that it tasted a lot like "Sunny Delight" (AKA "Sunny D").
