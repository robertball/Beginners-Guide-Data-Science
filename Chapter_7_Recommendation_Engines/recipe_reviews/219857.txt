This is a very quick, EASY, delicious recipe. I wanted a not-so-sweet roll, so I used half of what the inside called for in terms of butter & sugar, and used very little icing. It was perfect!  I suggest adding walnuts or pecans, too.

This is a great quick and easy recipe! I made a few changes to use what I had on hand. Coconut milk instead of dairy and Smart Balance spread instead of Melt.

This tastes ok, but I think it calls for too much baking powder as that is what i tasted.  We made this for Christmas morning and I would like to mention a few things about it. I gave it only 3 stars mainly because of the lack of directions. Do not plan on rolling this out as the directions say right after mixing it. I went against my better judgement of making the dough the night before and then refrigerating it. I ended up having to postpone breakfast while waiting for the dough to chill quickly in the freezer. Also, if you haven't worked with GF dough before you need to know that it is much easier to roll out if you put wax paper under it and on top of it. I rolled it out on the pan I was planning to cook it on with the wax paper underneath. I then used the paper to lift the dough off the pan and help me roll the dough. It worked much better this way.  One more thing I would like to mention is to go light on spreading the butter. I did use Earth Balance buttery spread, but I used too much. It ran down on the pan and made my dough spread out and look sloppy.  The next time I make these I am planning to use a little less baking powder and butter than called for and refrigerate the dough for at least a few hours.

I modified slightly. First I added only one tablespoon baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt for the self rising flour and a packet of plain glelatine to the flour mix. The dough was way too crumbly at first so I added an egg and a little more milk. The dough was sticky but pliable!  It rolled and cut easily. I baked them at 350 for 20 in a glass pie pan and they are amazing!  it is only 7 am on a Sunday. I want to wake my kids just to try them!!!

This is by far the most difficult recipe I ever had. The dough was so crumbly I had to use wax paper as the support, and it didn't rise at all when it came out of the oven. It tasted hard and flour-ery.

What a waste of ingredients!  I'm a very experienced baker, and could not get it to roll.    Flavor was great, but my kids wouldn't eat it because it looked like a crumbly mess.  Specify the type of gluten free flour you used, please.

I think the type of gluten-free flour you use will make a difference. I used Robin Hood but next time I'm going to try a chickpea/rice flour mix. I had to add a lot more liquid to make them work but WOW they taste great!

Tasted good. But, what a mess.  This recipe is very crumbly and very hard to keep together to roll and put on cookie sheet.  I ended up having to pt in muffin pan to hold together.  Will be looking for better recipe.

Dough fell apart and was very soft and nearly impossible to roll. Very sticky to the fingers. Tasted not bad but very hard to make.

I wish these turned out as well as others said.  Mido was really dry and crumbly, I think I must have to use the wax paper and the refrigerator like the other gal said. Otherwise, this recipe just does not work.

Almost like the real thing, but with a pumpkin taste.  Takes a little time to make but well worth it.  I froze the extra and they were just as good after being frozen.

My dough also wouldn't come together. I did everything right as far as I could tell and I had to add a lot more milk. I could barely keep the roll together and it tasted awful after it was cooked. Am I missing something?

Taste was great but since the recipe doesn’t specify the flour type I tried to use GF almond flour and almond milk because that is what we use at home and what was supposed to be dough, was like sticky putty. Therefore I spread it on a pizza pan and made cinnamon roll pizza. I will try a different flour next time to see if it took urns out better.

This was very easy to make. I added xanthan gum (it's added to recipes with gluten free flour to help them hold together), put clear wrap under and on top of the dough when rolling, and didn't have a single struggle with its being gluten free. For those who want to try the xanthan gum, I used 1/2 tsp. I also added nuts to the roll and sprinkled cinnamon sugar over the glaze. They look pretty good but they will probably only make it to 'good but not the best'.

Just tried this recipe, then read the reviews.  I am a fan of GF Bisquick. I use this a lot for baking, as I did for this recipe, replacing the self rising flour. it was very crumbly.  However, I added more milk until it was a medium soft dough. It is in the oven now. I think it will be wonderful. The dough tasted good! lol.

The dough would not come together no matter how much moisture I added.  I ended up with a crumbly mess.
