I'll give this four stars, but that is including my modifications... added some minced garlic and dash of hot pepper sauce to the finished product. I made a big pot and used the last of this dish in a quick pasta primavera.

Made this recipe last night exactly as written except I used smoked Sun Dried Tomatoes, it is simple and delicious. I didnt know they had smoked Sun Dried Tom until I went to purchase them. It was a nice addition especially for a side to Garlic Salmon.

I squeezed in a lemon instead of using butter to cut down on calories.  Good!

I was looking for something different to get me out of the "green bean's or corn" mentality.  It was colorful and good when served warm and great as a cold left over.

Great idea to mix the sun dried tomatoes with the squashes!  I mixed all the ingredients together and placed in a ziplock steamer bag to save on prep time while the main dish was baking.  The tomatoes added a nice flavor to the squash.

I used red onion (love red onion).  I love healthy low calorie recipes, especially if they include vegetables!  I actually made this as a snack!  LOL
Will definitely make again, would go great with some baked chicken!  Mmmmmmm.

This was so bland to me.  Not sure I thought the sundried tomatoes matched up with the squash & zuchinni.

Very good recipe - Ruby Tuesday's restuarant serves a similar recipe. Fresh vegetables make this one great!

8.22.18  Was very happy with the way this turned out.  I used sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil (what I had on hand), but I did blot them dry very well with paper towels.  I steamed in my microwave pot for 3 minutes rather than steaming on top of the stove and the squash still were crispy/crunchy.  Super simple side dish, and that little bit of sugar at the end really is nice.
