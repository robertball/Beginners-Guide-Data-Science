At the risk of sounding like I have nothing better to do, I made this 2 ways tonight.  One way was per recipe, with finely chopped cabbage, (for my kids who "claim" not to like it, they liked it this time) and the second was with quartered cabbage,  & with fresh polish sausage from my AWESOME butcher (my mom always told me to "make friends with the butcher" & it has paid off) for my husband & I.  WOW, I halved the butter & cooked the sausage with the potatoes & onion then added the cabbage for 5 min.  GREAT!  I had a nice long lunch out with my sisters today & this was a nice easy meal to make up lost time with!!  The kids enjoyed their version & we enjoyed ours as well..sooo easy!  Thanks Priscilla!!

This was very, very good.  The only thing I did a little different was put the ham in with the onions and the butter....my thinking was that the ham would season the cabbage and potatoes.  It was DELICIOUS!  When I told my kids what I was cooking they said they wanted peanut butter sandwiches, but I made them taste it. They each ate a huge portion and said, "Mom this is so good! I didn't know I liked cabbage!"  Thank you for an excellent, easy recipe!!!

This was amazing...save yourself some time and use a can of potatoes. I used chicken broth instead of the water and added it as needed so cabbage wouldn't stick or burn.  In stead of dashes I seasoned liberally with salt, pepper, paprika, and seasoning salt periodically as potatoes and cabbage cooked. I doubled the amount of ham and cut into small pieces so there was ham in every bite.  This was absolutely delish!  My son is my biggest critic ...he had not one bad comment (rare thing) and said "hmm, this is really good"!!

this recipe is quick, easy and takes alterations well.  i took others' advice and browned the potatoes first with the seasoning, then added about 1/2 can of chicken broth let it simmer then near the end of the cooking time, added the ham.  just before taking the pan of the heat, i added a handful of shredded cheese.  my husband ate the whole thing and raved about it.

We loved this! The first time I made it, my "medium heat" is apparently a little too hot with only 1/4 cup water and therefore, left unattended a little too long resulted in a burnt mess. HOWEVER, I tried it again today, using 3/4 cup chicken broth instead of 1/4c water, (which I started with 1/2c and added the remaining as needed) and turned out great! I also sprinkled all-season salt, garlic and onion powder to taste when I added the potatoes. At the end, I sprinkled about 1/2c sharp cheddar cheese overall. We all thought this had awesome taste and I would make it again! Not very elegant but it sure is filling! Thanks Priscilla!

I enjoyed this recipe with some slight changes.  I used chicken broth instead of water as several suggested  and kielbasa instead of ham.  Also to quicken up the preparation time, I used a can of diced potatoes instead of chopping up the recommended number of spuds. And this way I didn't have to worry about over cooking to get the potatoes tender.  Added some pepper for little more flavor.  I will be making this again. 
I've also found after making this a few times, it taste better the next day as leftovers. So now, I make it, allow it to cool then put it in the fridge to eat the next night.

I cubed the potatoes (slices fall apart with all the stirring involved in this recipe), used a half-cup of chicken broth, and added dashes of creole seasoning, black pepper, salt, garlic powder and paprika.  And I added the potatoes and ham right at the beginning, cooking everything until the cabbage wasn't crunchy.  Pretty tasty.

This is something I've made for years.  I use Polish kielbasa, potatoes, onions, cabbage, beef broth and always add a can of Cream of Mushroom soup.  It's "soul food"

Left out the onion and followed many of the previous suggestions - used broth instead of water (only needed 1/2 cup), used a smoked cooked ham, and added shredded cheddar.  Also, I fried the potatoes and ham before adding to the cabbage in butter, with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  This was a fantastic meal - I did not think I would like it at all and loved it.  Thanks!

So happy I stumbled upon this recipe on a blog.  I changed the order and I think the recipe turned out less mushy than it would have with the original recipe.  Fried the potatoes in olive oil first til browned, then added onion and ham.  Paprika, salt, garlic, and pepper.  Then took advice of other reviewers and used 1/2 C chicken stock, added the cabbage, covered it til tender.  We loved it!  Ground it up in the magic bullet for our baby too!  It was a hit and we will make it again with these changes/additions.

I used one can chicken broth instead of water, and replaced season salt with salt free seasoning (figured the ham and broth would add plenty of salt).  It was quite good, we'll make this again.

This recipe actually dates back a couple of centuries, but in all of its forms is delicious! In Britain, this is what is called "Bubble and Squeak".  

My mom's version has a southern twist and is called simply "fried cabbage". She begins with a couple tablespoons of light oil over medium-low heat, and then adds two tablespoons of bacon grease for the smoky flavor. Next, she adds the onions and cabbage together and allows them to caramelize a bit before reducing the heat to low, covering, and allowing it to cook for about 15 minutes in its own juices.  

When the cabbage is about "half-tender", she will add the sliced potatoes, salt & pepper, a dash of garlic powder, and julienne sliced ham, stir, and cover again until the potatoes are done.  If you wish it a little browned, like my family does, just turn up the heat after the spuds are done!  I always use a hard anodized non-stick skillet for this dish, so little oil is needed; and we don't like it drippy, so we omit the water or broth.  Any way you slice it, this dish is satisfying!

I've been fixing this for years. I add the cabbage & onion at the same time along with the water , simmer for about 10 minutes and then add my potatoes along with regular salt & pepper. At this point you can add diced jalapenos if you want it spicy . I use canned ham patties (cut into bite size pieces) because they are my boys' favorites out of everything I've tried in this . I then let it simmer dry &  add just enough oil or shortening to lightly brown some of it ( a preference of ours when frying potatoes or cabbage ). I always end up making two large skillets of this each time (I'm feeding teenage boys)and have yet to ever have leftovers !

I had forgotten how good this dish is, but I needed something fast. A few helpful hints: (1) NO WAY does this require an hour except for very novice cooks; mine took 35 minutes. Chop your cabbage while the onions are cooking; slice your potatoes (thin) while the cabbage is cooking; cut up the ham while the potatoes are cooking. I'm sure you see how this works. (2) This needs more salt; the amount depends on how salty your ham is. I added perhaps 1/4 t. of seasoned salt and 1/4 t. of plain salt and I also used chicken broth instead of water, as others here have suggested. (3) I used olive oil instead of margarine, and also melted 2 T unsalted butter over the lot when I was done. Delicious, comforting flavors.

This was better than I expected.  What made it really good was that my picky fiance helped himself to it as well... twice!  And he's never eaten cooked cabbage before!  I think using broth instead of water makes a big difference in the flavour (which was still very subtle).  I even spooned extra of the "sauce" over my portion.  This dish is hearty, filling, yet it was not heavy at all.  A perfect pre-workout lunch :)

I changed a few things but still really good!  I cooked the potatoes with the onions and held off putting in the cabbage until the potatoes were nearly done.  I don't like overdone cabbage and the potatoes needed to be cooked.  I also used little red potatoes instead of the big sliced potatoes.  I substituted chardonnay for the water-just because it's chardonnay!  Will make again!!!

This recipe surprised my husband who thought I had gone crazy in the kitchen---He couldn't get enough of it at dinner though.  Simple, basic recipe that satisfied the whole family. Gotta love that. I made personal touches like most have done.  Browned up the pototoes and ham with the onion before adding cabbage, then added broth vs. water. Thanks for sharing Priscilla.

This was delicious!!  I tweaked it a bit, using chicken broth (1/2 can) instead of water.  Used Kielbasa instead of the ham.  I also added garlic powder and garlic/pepper mixture.  I sauteed the onions and meat together, then added the potatoes (small red potatoes) and broth, cooking for about 15 minutes.  Then added the cabbage and cooked until done.  It turned out really really well.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipie came out wonderful! It was so filling too! I used a chicken based white wine and herb broth, and used sausage instead of ham with some rosemary, 1 clove of garlic, green onion, thinly diced carrots(like you get in bagged salads), potatoes, and red and green cabbage.
I cooked a large amount so I ended up using a pot with mostly broth and a few cups of water. Beautiful and delicious!

Very Good, But watch out for salt, You may not want to add season salt if the ham your using is salty. I can't believe someone added ketchup

We totally LOVED this dish.  My only rec is to add some green peppers to the dish.  It just added a little extra zing that my family adored.  They could not get enough of this, and ask for it on a regular basis.

This was SO good - my husband was laughing at me because I kept exclaiming how good it was!  I used leftover Honeybaked Ham - don't know if that made a difference or not, and yukon gold taters.  I also used chicken broth instead of water.  I threw the cabbage in, then put the taters in pretty quickly after and let it get pretty mushy before adding the ham.  I didn't measure the spices, and I added a little garlic powder & cayenne.  I also used only half a head of cabbage because I misread how much it called for.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was an easy supper, but just a little bland. The potatoes definitely need to cook longer than 5-10 minutes and I sliced them pretty thin. I used chicken broth instead of water. Served with mustard to give it some zing.

Yum yum yum!!  I love this dish.  I boil the potatoes before adding to my sauted onions and ham mix.  I always add the cabbage last and lastly mix in cooked green beans.  This is a fabulous easy meal!

This recipe was great. I used my leftover Christmas ham. We were snowed in and I couldn't get to the store for a head of cabbage, so I used a large jar of saurkraut, and rinsed and drained it well. My whole family loved it, even my picky kids!!!

added celery to the onions, and also added bacon bits, and garlic powder.  Substituted cajun seasoning for season salt & added extra ham.  Very easy, quick dish, and easy to modify/personalize.  A keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

I made a healthier, side-dish version of this, replacing small pieces of torn-up lean turkey meat in place of ham (fried with the onions and several cloves of garlic thrown in as well), and using vegetable spread rather than margarine. I also threw in the potatoes early to make sure they got done before the cabbage was mushy, and liberally seasoned with the seasoning salt and paprika, and used chicken broth as so many other reviewers recommended.  It was delicious as a side dish to our meal and my husband ate three huge helpings and raved about it!

Based on other reviews, used chicken broth instead of water but otherwise follow the recipe as written. Husband loved it and will definitely make again.

This was a very heavy, hearty but yummy recipe.  Based on others' reviews, I used chicken broth instead of water, and Polish kielbasa instead of ham.  (I sauteed the kielbasa with the potatoes and onions in the very beginning before adding the cabbage.)  Thanks Priscilla for a good "soul food" recipe  :)

I love this recipe its quick and easy.  I like to use kielbasa, bratworst or smoked sausage of some kind.  Along with some southwestern seasoning. It is gives a little added flavor.

Very good!  I am not a huge cabbage fan, but I got a huge head of cabbage from our farm share, and found this recipe.  
My husband and I really liked it, and even had seconds!  
I used some smoked sausage instead of the ham, because that is what I had on hand.  
The flavor is very simple, but not bland.  Hard to explain.  Don't serve this with something spicy though, it would detract from this dish. 
I will make this again!

Great comfort food for winter.  I used chicken broth, 2 cans of sliced potatoes and added garlic to the onions. I also added a pinch of sugar.
 Will definitely make again.  Thanks Priscilla.

I actually thought the results of this recipe were quite bland and plain - I too add a whole lot of sharp chedder to make it actaully quite yummy - so I suppose my rating is for the recipe plus the cheese addition.

I used turkey ham instead of regular ham, and cole slaw mix instead of chopping cabbage myself.  Also, I used red potatoes because I like those better than regular potatoes.  It turned out great - I have added it to my "tried and true" recipe collection :)

Very good! Cabbage is one of our favorite vegetables and this is a nice way to make it. I took the advice of one of the others and sauted the ham with the onions, it made almost a gravy that was very very good!

This was true cold-weather comfort food! In all fairness, I do have to state that instead of ham I used a 16oz. pkg. of turkey keilbasa and added 2 peeled, cored and chopped golden apples. It was so tasty!! Thank you!

This was a very good recipe but I did make a few changes.  I used chicken broth in place of water as others recommended.  I also added minced garlic to the onions and a tablespoon of parsley with the ham.  I used seasoning salt and paprika to taste.

This recipe is great for using left over ham... I followed a lot of the others ideas.. I added garlic to the onions, used a can of chicken broth instead of the water and it did take a little longer to cook. But it was really a keeper! Thanks.

Quick, easy and very tasty.  Great comfort food.  Now have a good recipe, in addition to scalloped potatoes, for using up leftover ham.  Substituted some leftover ham stock I had for the water.

Loved it!  I also used the chicken broth instead of H20.  I sliced the potatoes as in recipe but next time may choose to dice.  Flavors are amazing together and plan to incorporate this into a weekly dish thru the winter season.  Yummy!

I am always looking for a way to use leftover ham. In an attempt to use less sodium in our diet, I made blackened seasoning without the salt and used 2 tablespoons of that. Quick comfort food at it's finest!

Excellent recipe!  I actually cooked this in my new electric pressure cooker, and it literally took 6 minutes.  I cooked it in about a cup of chicken broth, and it was quite delicious.

Yum!
I added the ham and onion to the pre-heated skillet with butter and olive oil and let that go while I cubed the potatoes ( I used red, rinsed and roughly chopped) Then added roughly chopped cabbage and a can of chicken broth...I also added a half envelope of a ham flavored powder made by Goya...let simmer about 20 minutes and tasted, adding a bit of sea salt and Lawry's Seasoned Pepper, which I've been addicted to for about 40 years....by far, the best seasoned pepper I have ever had.
I absolutely loved it on this cool and rainy evening! I had to have seconds...YUM YUM YUM!

Loved it!!!  In order to save calories and time I changed a couple of things.  Used olive oil spray for the onions.  I bought  the frozen already chopped up onions so I saved some time.  As others suggested, I used broth, canned potatoes and rather than cut cabbage I bought a bag of slaw mix.  I also opted for turkey ham.  I like flavor, so I seasoned heavily - kosher salt, paprika, garlic, etc.  At the last minute, I threw in some crushed red pepper.  My cooking time was much less, but the outcome was tasty!!!  This is going into the "Family Favorites" file.

This wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. It was very plain. I wouldn't make it again.

I tried this recipe because my husband can't eat traditional corned beef and cabbage.  I subbed deli corned beef for the ham, and it came out great.  Wonderful idea.  I cut the potatoes in the food processor.  I think next time I will add some shredded carrot to make it even more traditional.

Thank you Priscilla

I had a lot of leftover cabbage after making fillled cabbages and i was looking for a good recipe.  This is great - I used about 1.5 cups of chicken broth and added chopped carrots.  Once everything was cooked i scooped it into a baking dish.  There was about 1/2 cup of broth remaining in the skillet, so I added 1 tbsp butter to the pan and reduced heat to low, I then whisked together 1 tbsp flour with 1/3 cup milk and added it to the pan, stirring continuously.   keep stirring and sprinkle in the cheddar cheese (1/2 cup or more) to make a cheese sauce - then pour it over the ingredients in the baking dish.  Top with bread crumbs and either bake & serve right away or put it in the freezer for an easy bake meal later.

I added a full tsp of garlic salt and 1/2 tsp of paprika, plus some ground pepper. I definitely used chicken stock rather than water. Additionally, we didn't have any ham, so I used chicken. It was great!

Yummy!  I did make a few changes: did a small dice on our ham and potatoes, thinly sliced the cabbage.  I cooked the ham with the onions at the beginning, waited on adding the cabbage till last, and subbed broth for water.  I did have to add a little more liquid to the pot once I started to cook the potatoes and I did have to cook them for longer than 20 minutes - I think because they were diced and not sliced AND also because we are at a high altitude.  I added the cabbage just before we were ready to eat and only let it cook 'just enough.'  Really economical and easy dish.  Thanks for sharing it!!

This is a scrumptious dish. When making cabbage this way or any way I always add lemon pepper and a little sugar (my mother's way) and children and adults alike love it this way, even without the potatoes.

I didn't really like this very much. It tasted sort of strange and a bit bland. I increased the seasoning and added a bit of my own which helped some, but not much. But then my younger sister told me that it smelled a lot like chinese noodles. So I decided to add noodles which really made it taste A LOT better. Thats the only reason I'm even giving it 3 stars. With the noodles and a few more alterations, I might make it again.

Comfort food just like Mom made many years ago. Easily used with whatever"s on hand -- ham, kielbasi, etc. Hubby adds some vinegar to finished meal, but I haven"t tried that myself.

I really loved this recipe!  I cooked with 1 can of chicken broth instead of water and I cooked the ham with the onions and cabbage the entire time so it could release its juices.  My daughter loved it and so did my parents.

This is a good comfort food. I usually cook the vegetables in a mixture of bacon grease and butter with garlic. I also cook the potatoes seperately from the cabbage, so they'll crisp up better. Serve this with cheesy scrambled eggs, hot coffee and a nice fluffy biscuit and you'll have one heck of a breakfast.

This recipe accomplished the impossible - it got my 21-year old son to eat cabbage and LIKE it!!  I made a couple of changes - I used some leftover chicken broth instead of water, added some garlic with the onion and added cooked bulk Italian sausage instead of ham.  I was just hoping to get my son to eat it tonight, but he asked me to make it again sometime.

As recommended in another review, I used kielbasa rather than ham.  I sliced the potatoes about 1/2 inch thick and it caused the cooking time to take much longer than stated.  However the taste was really good.  I'll use this again soon.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is very much like "Bubble and Squeak" from England. If you have Brussel Sprouts, fresh homegrown, cook gently and use them instead of cabbage. Please use butter for best flavor, the potatoes are leftover boiled in the English recipe. Ham, sausages, any meat are good additons. I love cheese, but doesn't add anything for me in tis recipe. Up to you! Nice posting, I love this site! Mike

This is a great recipe.  I have made a similar dish using canned corned beef.  When I make it again I'll try the potatoes and maybe some canned carrots!! Poor-man's Corned Beef and Cabbage!! Yummy!
UPDATE-- I tried it with canned potatoes and canned carrots it was very good..not really healthy but quite tasty!!

My father was a cook for the Army during the Korean war.  He raised me and my brothers on this recipe, except that he used Spam in place of the ham.  If we ever show up at his house and it's on the stove, we all fight for it!
Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It's great the way it is.  I also have made it with chicken broth, but it's also great when made with spring water.

This was a great week night dinner that is great for playing with.  I had a little bit of ham so I added some Polish sausage and I used about a half can of chicken broth instead of the water and half a large head of cabbage.  Everything tured out delish and my boys ate it all up. I served it with some sourdough rolls and it was great.  I do have to say that I prefered the ham over the sausage having used both in the recipe.  The ham had a better taste and texture so I'll use all ham next time.

I really liked this recipe, it was simple and comforting. It also works well with ready made sausage. I found that adding a 1 or 2 genorous spoons of spicy mustard and a tiny bit more water makes for a very tasty dish.

I followed the recipe as directed.  My kids don't like cabbage so only my husband and I ate this. I think the next time I will fry some chopped bacon and then saute the potatoes in the grease first to see if this could add some extra flavor.

I was looking for something other than steak, pork and chicken. This caught my eye. At first I was a little worried, but it turned out pretty good. The only problem was that the cabbage cooked down so much that there was hardly any cabbage. It looked like just potatos and ham. Next time I would use a little bigger head. other than that, it's perfect. Thanks for sharing. :o)~

Very good!  I think I'll try the chicken broth next time.  Also, I added a few more dashes of seasoned salt and paprika and I still added more when it was on my plate, so next time I will add more to the skillet.  But, was so good I ate all the leftovers the next day!  My hubby doesn't like cabbage so it was all mine, lol.

I made this last night & my husband loved it! He didn't think it was much to look at & was surprised at how good it was. I used water & not chicken broth & it had lots of flavor, probably from the ham (honey-baked ham).  Will definelty make this again.

The taste was good.  My husband and I enjoyed it.  I too used broth (ham soup starter).  I also boiled the potatoes first, for fear of the potatoes not being done in time.  Didn't turn out the was I expecting.  Will not boil potatoes next time.  Looks like a weird combo, but really was good.  Thanks.

Simply excellent!  It reminded me of a recipe that my "Southern Mom" used to make (minus the fat-back).  Can't wait to try it with Kielbasa too.

This turned out good with a few enhancements as suggested by other reviewers.  Using chicken broth instead of water helped alot, along with frying the potatoes beforehand with additional seasonings.  My husband does not like cabbage but he ate around it & seemed to like the rest.  I thought the cabbage was very good! (Although I bought the smallest head they had at the store, and I could barely use half of it - any more would not have fit in my large skillet.)  You could easily use kielbasa in this recipe also.

I loved this recipe.  I had a huge bag of shredded cabbage to use so it worked out perfect.  I was kind of confused about how much water to add so I just kept adding it, as needed, in order to steam the vegetables (but not too much so it didn't turn into soup). I did modify the spices a little by using garlic salt, garlic powder, salt, pepper, oregano and basil instead of what's called for in the recipe.  My 3 year old daughter didn't even know she was eating cabbage!

Made 1/2 recipe for 2 hungry people and had more than enough! Potatoes were a little problem-some mushy and some just barely done. Next time I think I will precook the taters (either boil or nuke) then just brown the onions, meat and cabbage in the spices.  It is pretty bland-needs garlic or something. Hubby loved it as is!

It's was easy and much better than boiled cabbage mush. My kids 15 & 9 even liked it!
It was a wonderful choice for using leftover ham.

Growing up in an Irish household, we had cabbage and corn beef weekly, but this might be my new go-to! It was so much easier than having to cook a full piece of corn beef and the ham was just as tasty. I used a ham steak (it was on sale) that I chopped up, two large potatoes, one onion, and a large head of cabbage. I followed the directions exactly, and it made a huge pot! Plenty for leftovers that were even better the next day! Definitely recommend!

I just made this easy meal for supper and it was so good that my husband and I kept returning to the serving dish for "just one more spoonful."  I made a few changes to the original recipe, too.  Because I did not have butter, I used about 1/2 TBSP. bacon drippings to cook the onion. I also added three cloves of fresh garlic since we love garlic in our home.  I added the potatoes to the pot first and then added the cabbage, which I chopped roughly.  I used a one lb.  package of smoked sausage instead of ham. After we put on our plate, we sprinkled with apple cider vinegar.  Delicious!!!!

Just made and with my changes, I loved it!  Used red potatoes (cubed them) and more than called for, also used Cajun seasoning and minced 2 serranos and added those for more zip, also used about 1/2 cup chicken broth!  Put a thawed package of chopped collards in it for more color.  Turned out so good !!!!!!  Too bland the way it was, but loved with changes made

Added some leeks and rutabaga, and used sliced bratwurst instead of ham.  The entire batch disappeared.  I was hoping for some leftovers for lunch, so will make a bigger batch next time.

This is one of those recipes that you just aren't sure about while cooking, until the last minute when it all comes together... And then you are soo glad you made it! I made this exactly as the recipe calls for except I used the bag of chopped cabbage. It is fantastically delicious and the perfect dinner for a cold night!

Husband loved this. I made per a suggestion and put onion, potato and kielbasa in a large cast iron skillet. Cooked that for 10 min or so and added water and cabbage. Covered and cooked for 10 more minutes. I used vegetable magic for seasonings and nothing else.

I've been making versions of this for years. I've use ham or a sliced sausage, chicken stock in place of the water, cube the potatoes rather than slice and the cabbage is always the last thing I add because I prefer it with a little crunch.

Made this tonight, it was delicious! Used some extra paprika and lawrys, and added black pepper. Also used a cup of chicken broth in place of the 1/4 cup of water. Had to simmer an extra 20 minutes to get my potatoes mushy like my fiance likes them. I usually make this in a crockpot, but this is a quicker and equally delicious alternative.

Very good dish and my husband loved it! After sauteing the onion in butter, I threw in the cabbage, ham, chopped potatoes, a cup of chicken broth, and let it simmer for about 15 minutes. Once it was done simmering, I seasoned to taste with onion powder, garlic powder, seasoning salt, and pepper. We topped ours off with sharp cheddar cheese! YUM!

Having found a bag of sliced ham in the freezer I set out to find something to fix with it, with ingredients I had on hand.  This recipe proved to be a winner with my DH and me.  It is a no frills meal that tastes wonderful and was very filling.  I didn’t change anything in the recipe, except that my ham was sliced, rather than cubed.  But, next time I will add some Cajun seasoning or a little cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit.  I served this with a simple salad and a loaf of crusty bread.  I will be making this one again.

Good comfort food! I diced my potatoes with a splash of canola oil and spices to taste and baked them instead, just out of personal preference. I added them to the cooked cabbage mixture, which made dinner on the table in less than 25 minutes. I call that a success for a weeknight! I didn't have smoked ham this time, but would defintely use that next time to amp up the flavor a bit. I'd love to experiment with this and try bacon, smoked turkey sausage or even flavored chicken sausage. This is definitely going on the fall/winter dinner rotation!

The only change I made to this recipe was using chicken broth instead of water.  It turned out very tasty - my kids and mother in law loved it, and I found it to be very satisfying.  My husband isn't a cabbage fan, and while he ate it, he just didn't love this one.

I found this dish bland and tasteless.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I even read several reviews wondering how others might "kick" it up, but no one did so I decided to give it a go, as is.  We ate it...adding ketchup, which helped.  Different strokes, I guess!!

I hardly ever make anything by a recipe, and this was no exception; however, this is a great base to build on and  really make a dish you love.
I cut up 2 onions (love 'em) and a link of smoked beef sausage and sauteed them in butter, using beef broth for the cooking liquid. I also diced the potatoes and parboiled them a bit ahead of time, adding them near the end of cooking so they soaked up the broth and became crispy in spots.
I will definitely build on this and perhaps add tomato sauce or cream and cheese on top. Excellent and very filling!

I just made this.  Yum!  I made three changes.  First, I used about a cup of water.  Second, I used chicken boullion instead of salt and paprika.  The third was cooking the potatoes and ham right along with the onions.

Oh my!  This was sooo good!  Like others suggested, I made a couple minor changes.  I used a cup of water with Knorrs (chicken) bouillon and an onion cube (gives the flavor without the texture of onion).  At the end I added some shredded cheddar cheese and it was amazing!  I didn't even use any seasoning (because of the bouillon/onion cube) and it was outstanding.  I will never make it differently!

Made this for dinner tonight.  Everyone loved it.  I put it all in a crockpot to cook all day.  The only thing I  added was a little garlic and dried mustard as other suggested.  Don't think that would've made it a 4* without the two ingredients.  Came out delicious

Yummy!  I also followed the suggestions of others... chicken broth instead of water, and added ground mustard and garlic salt to the list of spices. I cooked the potatoes and ham with the onions in the skillet before adding liquid,and nothing came out mushy. I also used pre-boiled red cabbage which turns purple when you cook it and it made quite a stunning dish!

Good recipe, even 2 of the 3 kids liked (fussy one would barely try it) substituted chicken broth for water though.

This is a great recipe that can be adapted for your family's taste. I had leftover ham and had a craving for corned beef and cabbage. Since it was just me I wasn't about to spend the money on corned beef. I improvised this recipe a bit by filling a tea ball with pickling spice and adding a splash of vinegar to the cooking liquid. I ended up cooking it a lot longer at the end because the cabbage was too crunchy but that was my fault for wedging the cabbage instead of chopping. Next time I would throw everything together and cook around 30 mins with the wedged cabbage(personal preference). I only gave it a 4 because I can't imagine making this without adding something. I am surprised with such few ingredients the recipe called for margarine and not butter. I think it needs that added flavor.

Very quick and easy.  I do not cook with salt used Mrs Dash.  I figured that there would be enough salt added using the ham.  I will make this again.  I never measure anything an just eyeballed everything it called for.

Great recipe as is - or really can cut down on some calories by omitting the margarine and just cooking the onions w/the cabbage.  Also fried it up the next morning with some scrambled eggs:) YUM!

Definitely one of the better ways to eat cabbage! I put a frozen gruyere stuffed sausage in to sautee with the onion and left it in until the end...that provided a yummier flavor than the ham would've (which I left out). at the end, I cut up the sausage and added a touch of red pepper. I would suggest checking after 20 minutes though, because mine ran out of water ad scourched the bottom of the pan a little. My husband really enjoyed it, though he tends to nit like cabbage much.

This was even better than I expected!  I  sprinkled the potatoes with seasoning salt and browned the sliced potatoes in margarine first, then added the onion.  After a few minutes I added frozen shredded cabbage and poured in chicken broth instead of water, I didn't measure but at least 1 cup because I added 4 potatoes.  Forgot the paprika but added at least 1/2 teas. black pepper.  super easy and good, even my picky mom liked it!!  will always make this when we have leftover ham.  Thanks!!

This recipe was very good. My boyfriend thought it was fabulous.  I didn't change anything in the recipe.    This would probably be great with smoked sausage instead of ham as well.

The person who wrote this recipe must have a much bigger skillet than me!  I used a large cast iron skillet (12 or 14 inches in diameter) and it was not big enough.  The onion and potatoes and ham filled it up, so I had to make the cabbage seperately.  Still, once mixed all together, it was very tasty!  I used more than a dash of seasoning salt, also added regular salt and pepper and a bit of garlic salt.  I also used olive oil rather than butter, and needed more than 1/4 a cup of water even though i cooked the potatoes for a few minutes in the microwave before adding them to the skillet.

This was tasty, but without adding extra seasoning it would have been bland. I used a creole seasoning which had a little bite to it.  I also added the potatoes way before I added the cabbage as raw potatoes take MUCH longer to cook that shredded cabbage. I used chicken sausage instead of ham and enjoyed this. it was comfort food

It was good, but I made a few changes! I added extra paprika and season salt! I also added salt and pepper and more liquid so it was more soupy! It's very filling. Next time I will add the potatoes sooner because they took forever to cook and the cabbage was overdone. Great recipe with changes!

This was very quick, simple and tasty.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.  I was looking for a recipe to use items I had on hand in the fridge.  I had to substitute one sweet potato because we only had 2 red potatoes and a sweet potato in the fridge, and it turned out very nice.  I will definitely serve this again.

5-Stars from me too!  We really enjoyed this.  I cooked the onions in extra virgin olive oil instead of butter and added some garlic.  Next time, I'll probably just use salt and pepper instead of seasoning salt and leave out the paprika.  Very good dish!

This recipe is a keeper!!  Not too many ingredients, quick to put together and very tasty.  It is great for a busy week day.  My husband loved it - which is the main point when preparing a meal.  I spiced it up a bit with crushed red pepper flakes - we ate every bit, finishing the remainder for lunch the next day.

Nice combination of ingredient that we love, very simple to make. I diced the potatoes and boiled them for a little bit before adding them. I wanted to make sure the cabbage didn't get overcooked.Not many leftovers!

Not bad for a fast and easy meal. The cabbage was a little mushier than I like, so if I do cook this again I will cook the cabbage for less time. It needs something more to make it a little less bland.

This was great. I really liked how hand's off it was. I was able to multi-task while it was cooking. My husband loves cabbage so I am experimenting with ways to cook it and this is a keeper. I will make again.

I wasn't sure about this recipe but it is a simple, satisfying meal.  I only put in half the cabbage, don't want to freak out the kids too much! I microwaved then chopped up the potatoe to hurry the prep along. I added more chicken stock and served this as a stew. Also, added more seasonall to taste.  Thanks we really enjoyed this meal.

Excellent!!  It does taste better with kielbasa sausage instead of ham.  I tried both the first time I made it.  I used turkey kielbasa from butterball and it just gave it more flavor.

I love this recipe, however, sometimes I get bored with so few ingredients, I add some green, red and yellow or orange peppers for color and taste.  A quarter head of red cabbage is also very tasty.  Other times I add no meat at all and just veggie out with the cabbage and lots of veggies that correspond with cabbage.  Explore your options.  If you need water, use chicken broth instead.  I use a little EVOO and "fry" my mix.

Very easy and delicious. I too used Chicken Broth, but to give it some kick I added a Tablespoon of French Dijon Mustard. Made it tangy and and tasted even better the next day....

I sauteed the onion and ham together, added the cabbage (which I bought pre-shredded) and 1/2 cup chicken broth and let simmer. Before adding diced potatoes, I added garlic powder, celery salt, a pinch of cumin and some dried oregano.  I also added freshly ground pepper.  I simmered all for about 20 minutes and it was so delicious.

this was suprisingly delicious. we almost didnt make it because of all the cabbage but it ended up not tasting like cabbage at all. i used chicken broth instead of water. also i reduced the cooking time by atleast 10 mins by cutting my potatoes with my mandeline attachement that makes nice match stick potatoes. actually i cut everything in the recipe with it. will make again for sure.

Very easy, tasty and inexpensive dish.  I took the advice of others and boiled my potatoes first, I also used polska kielbasa instead of ham.  I also added some minced garlic while I was sauteing the polska, cabbage and onion.  Will be making again.

I really enjoyed this recipe! I didn't have ham, so I used chicken instead. After everything was cook I added some chopped pieces of bacon and it was excellent. Would definitely make this again.

This recipe was delicious and really easy with very little prep time. I did half and half yam/potato, used chicken stock instead of water and added some extra salt and pepper to the skillet.  Will definitely be making this one many times again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Suprisingly tasty.  I actually cooked this in my wok, so the potatos came out perfect, not overdone.  I love cabbage, so I used a large head.  Used diced lean ham, about 3 cups.  Good flavor, and not greasy at all.

This recipe was great!  I cheated a little because I was in a hurry. At the suggestion of my husband I used the McCormick Potato Steamers rosemary and garlic and cooked my potatoes in the microwave while the cabbage was steaming.  When the potatoes were done I added them to the cabbage then the ham. I let it all cook together for another 5 minutes or so to warm up the ham.  It was great and so easy.

This is a good quick dish to be so simple. I made it for one in a small cast iron skillet and used a Hebrew National hot dog chopped up in place of the ham. Bet it would be good with kielbasa too. Thanks, Priscilla!

This made my Irish blood smile :)

I cooked the onions and the ham together first as suggested by other reviewers, and boiled the fresh, thickly sliced potatoes in a separate pot while the cabbage simmered. I used 1/2 a can of chicken broth when simmering the cabbage, and the other 1/2 when I added the potatoes. Skipped adding more sodium, added an extra dash of paprika. DELISH!

We love cabbage (especially the one we can get in Portugal that does not have all that tough core) and this is a great way to cook it.   Definitely, for us, I use chicken broth and will try different types of sausage along the way.

I had some leftover ham and some red potatos to use.  Due to my dd's allergies, I was looking for something that didn't have cheese or milk in it.  This recipe was great!  I didn't have to modify it, and the whole family liked it.  Thanks!

I read the reviews of others and based on their experience I made the following changes to the recipe:  I substituted 1 tablespoon bacon grease in place of margarine, used 3/4 cup chicken broth in stead of water, sliced up 1 lb. Kielbasa instead of 2 cups diced ham.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon whole caraway seeds for a slight nutty flavor instead of a spicy flavor as others have done.  I no leftovers for the next day from this meal.

This recipe is almost identical to the one our Russian Nanny makes for the kids.  The only difference is to substitute the butter with olive oil and add chicken broth.  She makes it with many different types of suasage, but tonight I am going to put the ham in.  We love it and my kids do too.  Oh, ya, I also put in a few very thinly sliced carrots for color and added flavor.

Very good recipe.  Just make sure you use as it states: a SMALL head of cabbage.  I had so much cabbage that the remaining ingredients seemed like they were but mere condiments than main ingredients.  Also, be careful as to not overcook the potatoes.  Tried it with Kielbasa this time around. And used broth as others suggested for added flavor.  The dish did take a little longer than stated in the recipe, but all in all it's very easy, yet very tasty.  Even those in our family that don't typically care for cabbage liked it.  Look forward to making it again and again until I get the timing and ingredient portions just right for perfection.  Thank you for this great keeper of a recipe!  Can see this making a great tasting soup base as well.

I like this fast and easy dish.  I use Penszy's Old World Seasoning and it makes it even easier.  It's good when I have frozen ham diced up and in a rush to make something for dinner on a cold night.

This recipe was excellent.  My family loved it. I make a cabbage stir fry with cabbage, garlic, olive oil and salt.  This was very similar... only kicked up a notch!  It was very easy to make.  This will be a keeper for us.

My mother liked this recipe a lot and said it reminded her of something her mother made as a child. I thought it was ok. It needed a little more spice than just a dash of this and that. I used chicken broth as suggested.

YUM! Cooked this with chicken broth, didn't brown the taters first though. Added sour cream at the table-it added a little zing. Would be good cooked with apple juice maybe or with some sauerkraut or apple cider vinegar perhaps. I'll be making this again!

I followed some other's suggestions and 1)browned potatoes and ham with the onions before I added the cabbage 2)used half a cup of chicken broth instead of water. I also used leftover ham and added garlic powder in with the spices. The result: YUMMY! The perfect comfort food for a chilly night. I'll definitely be making this again!

I loved this recipe, it was simple and delicious. (especially if you love cabbage). I added alot more than a dash of salt,pepper, and paprika, that was the only change I made. 
Will make again.

This was a very tasty recipe. My husband even liked it and he normally won't eat cooked cabbage. I added the blackening spice for fish just to give it a bit of hot spice punch.

Not very flavorful....ham tasted good, but really not impressed and my son really didn't like it because of the cabbage (even though it didn't give much flavor). Thought I'd try something a little different, but this was a no for us.

This was very good and my family enjoyed it a lot. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because cooking it as directed resulted in under-cooked potatoes. I would probably partially cook the potatoes in a glass bowl in the microwave for a bit before adding them to the pan next time.

Everyone in the family loved this recipe, even the teenager, that doesn't like cabbage.  I didn't make too many changes to the recipe. The main difference was  I used chicken broth instead of water.  I also used more than the recipe calls for.  I cooked the potatoes separately and used the broth in those.  I also cooked most cabbage in the broth. If I had to guess, I probably used almost a cup of broth that cooked into the potatoes or cooked out throughout the process.  I also added garlic to the seasoning ingredients since we use garlic on practically everything.  Hubby said he could eat this every night. I had to make sure that I saved this one for another time.

Love this! Make it with left over ham or use Polish sausage. I use chicken stock instead of water and add sauteed mushrooms. One of my husbands favorites!

I've made this twice now.  It's very tasty, but it takes at least an extra half hour for the potatoes to cook, unless you like them crunchy (half raw).  Otherwise, it's very good.

Love a one skillet meal.  I did as several other, increased seasoning, added the ham immediately so the flavor would soak into the potatoes and cabbage and used chicken broth instead of water.  Took a bit longer and more liquid than recipe, but came out great.  Have done it with Kielbasa too -even more flavor.  We're fans!

Made no changes with exception of type of potato- I used new potatoes. Family rated it 8 out of 10. It's one of those recipes that I might make again but wouldn't go out of my way to plan and shop for.

I enjoyed it, but my husband complained it was too salty.  I only added Mrs. Dash (no salt) and paprika as seasoning.  The ham was too much.  I will make it again, but will add ground beef instead of ham.

This isn’t bubble and squeak as was mentioned. I’m British and 69years old and bubble and squeak is fried up mashed potatoes and cabbage or whatever green veggie you have and a bit of onion. It has no meat.

Loved by the whole family.  It all came together well.  I precooked both the cabbage and potatoes in the microwave a bit to soften.  I added some garlic powder, black pepper and creole seasoning. It takes a bit of prep but is easy.  Very tasty and no need to turn on the oven!  I think it would also be good with kielbasa in place of the ham.

This is comfort food.  I made it as written this time but next time I'd do a few things differently.  If I don't use broth, I will definitely add salt.  I'm not one to add salt at the table but this needed it.  This requires much more than the 1/4 c. water if you cook this long.  Also, my thinly sliced potatoes took too much extra time to cook.  Next time I'll do potatoes with the cabbage.  It will lessen the cooking time and the cabbage shouldn't go to mush.  I imagine this will be even better the second day.

I used left over spiral ham that I had cooked, so had juice from that and used that juice instead of chicken broth. I cooked the cabbage by itself in the ham juice I had left over because I was aftaird the cabbage would be overcooked.  It came out really well, and I would do this again!!!

I sautéed the onions and cabbage (finely chopped),  and added 3/4 cup chicken broth. I added the ham in and cooked until the cabbage was done, then added two leftover diced baked potatoes. When it was heated through, I put five slices of cheese on the top and melted it, then stirred in. Not pretty, but good flavor.

I made a few changes, chicken broth rather than water and fried my potatoes and sausage to brown before adding to the mix. It was perfect.

We really liked this! Even my husband who doesn't particularly care for cabbage commented that this was very good. In addition to the seasoned salt & paprika, I added a little garlic powder. And once on our plates, we added pepper. Will likely make this one again when we have leftover ham.

Made this with some changes, using what I had, and it was delicious!  Didn't use gnocchi because I didn't have any, substituted cooked potatoes.  Added a little chicken broth and simmered for about half and hour.  Tasted so much better than I expected it to!

Love this recipe! A family favorite. Minor changes - I use 1/2 - 1 cup chicken broth instead of water. Also add in some minced garlic.

Very tasty, Priscilla!
I think my favorite variation on this will go like this: half the ingredients, brown the Johnsonville Irish O'Garlic sausages (try them!!!) in my cast iron skillet and remove, add a Tbsp of butter, brown the cubed potatoes, remove from pan, add another Tbsp of butter to sautée the onions and cabbage for 5-10, add 3/4 C chicken broth, top with sausages, top with potatoes, cover and simmer for 10-15 minutes. I serve it with ketchup, sour cream, or spicy ground mustard although it really doesn't need it.

So i used 1/2 lb of bacon fried to crisp. Saved 2 T. of fat to fry out onions , potatoes and cabbage. I had some leftover kielbasa and added that instead of ham. Husband loved it ....so did I. Other than these changes I used recipe as written.

I prefer my potatoes a little softer and cabbage crisper so, I reversed directions by cooking potatoes first then added cabbage and also put in some sliced baby carrots. I used vege broth instead of just water and added canned green beans and pepper at the end. Turned out like a Ham Stew. I am going to try this next time in a crock pot. It was delicious and perfect on a cold day with hot cornbread!

Great simple recipe.  I used chicken soup stock instead of salt and as an afterthought, threw in some shredded carrots.  Positive my husband will love this.

Other than needing a little more salt - this was an excellent recipe and very simple. I think I may try shredding cheddar cheese over the top and putting in the oven til melted - bet it would be awesome! My whole family loved it and compliments were flying. Now that doesn't happen every day!

My dad used to make something similar to this when I was younger, except he put the ham, potatoes, cabbage, onion and green beans in a stock pot and covered with water, put a couple bay leaves and a ham hock in it and let it simmer for a couple hours. We would eat it with corn bread. This recipe is fantastic and tastes just like my dads. I did add a couple bay leaves to this and added a few good shakes of season salt, paprika, pepper and garlic powder. Thank you Priscilla!

Great recipe!  I was looking for ways to use a cabbage from my garden.  The only change I made was adding chopped green pepper to the onion.  Even my 6yo and 8yo gave this recipe a 5 out of 5 and they are not fans of mixed casserole type dishes!!  This is my first review even though I've been using this site for years.

Fabulous. I too doubled the ham, used 1c chix broth, doubled the potatoes, and added the ham when I added the potatoes. Everyone loved it including a picky 4y old & 16 mos old.

I love this recipe! This is comfort food for me.  I remember my great-grandmother boiling cabbage and potatoes and ham for what seemed like forever to make this dish.  That's what I was expecting to do when I went looking for a recipe.  I appreciate the love that she put into it, but it turns out that it wasn't at all necessary LOL.  I've made it multiple times and I don't change a thing about the recipe.  It's a great weeknight, inexpensive dinner.

This was really good.  I used beef, link sausage cut up into bite size pieces.  I cooked the mixture in beef stock and added about 1/4 cup red wine.  Also, in the last few minutes of cooking, I added frozen, green peas.  It was tasty.

Reminds me of a dish my house mom in Spain made us called rollo repollo. I don't use margarine so used half butter, half olive oil to sautee onions. I think half a cabbage would work better because it was falling out of the pan with a whole cabbage. Make sure you cut your potatoes small enough to cook otherwise it will take some time. I also use 1-2 tsp of paprika because I love it!

This recipe was very good with a few tweaks because this would have been way too bland as written.  I added about 8 dashes of paprika, 10 dashes of season salt, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and Tony Cachere's seasoning to taste for some spice.  Yummy!

Easy to make if you already have the cooked ham and a quick way to shred the cabbage.  I fed it to 4 men today and they all commented about how good it was (more than once), even the one who doesn't care for cabbage liked it.

This was a pretty tasty combination. It was a little bland so i added about a half cup of sour cream, 1/4 cup of parmesan and some dubliner.  This would have been tasty with some sherry, too.

Very good. I added a bit more Seasoning Salt than just a pinch though -- basically just to-taste. Other than that it was a great recipe as-is.

Used Chinese five spice instead of seasoned salt and paprika.  Used vegetable broth instead of water. VERY tasty and succulent even!  I'd make it again!

The entire family likes the flavor of this dish.  After making it a number of times, I have cut the amount of cabbage down to half a head.  The kids don't like the stringy soft cabbage as much as the hubby and I.  They're more likely to eat this if there's less cabbage.

Easy, delicious comfort food.  Save calories and leave out the butter - I did, plus used ham with NO fat, and it was yummy. Heavy on the paprika, and added garlic.  So good, hubby stuffed himself on it.  Also, pre-cooked my potatoes in the microwave and tossed in with the already simmering concoction.

I am not good at following directions so this was my variation. I chopped and fried some bacon then used the fat to start my onions. I had to add a little butter because the bacon did not produce enough. I used new or red potatoes sliced. I like stuff on the spicy side but my wife does not so I put crushed red pepper on my serving but not in the dish. I seasoned with salt and pepper. The rest was on point and by the recipe. When it was ready I crushed and sprinkled the bacon back into the dish. I had bought a whole ham butt end with the bone. I boned it out and put the bone in a pot of blackeyed peas. The cabbage and ham was served with a side of blackeyes for our New Years dinner.

I have made this recipes for years via skillet or crockpot.  When I cook in the crockpot I use one can of chicken broth. I use link sausage, not ham.  Easy meal.

I made this but put the potatoes and cabbage in together after the onions. I also added garlic powder to the onions and then also used it in the potatoe mixture. I added alot more water as I made this for 10 servings. My kids loved it and they are picky eaters. Will try again..

This was delicious!  I think the recipe, as written would have been 4 stars but with the changes was easily 5+.  I used unpeeled red potatoes & I let them cook for a bit longer than the recipe indicated, they really thickened the broth.   I also added a large sliced carrot with the onion, it brought some nice color to the dish.  One thing that I just happened to have that I think really made this amazing was frozen ham broth.  I defrosted & added that instead of just water - I had about 3 cups and it was a the thickness of stew.  This is a wonderful, hearty meal on a cold night.  I had been working outside on the coldest, windiest day of the year and my husband was fighting a cold, this was just what the doctor ordered.   Next snow storm this WILL be on the menu - thanks, Priscilla!

This was easy to make.  Adapted the recipe slightly by adding pepper when the cabbage was added.  We also a can of corn for color when the meat was added.  Instead of using ham, we used a chicken hotdog (with red peppers and spinach) sliced thinly.  It was very good.

Dh and i made this yesterday, it was so good! I doubled the recipe just cause, and im glad i did or their would not have been enough to go around!. This is a keeper. Oh we didnt have any ham but it was still good without it. We added 2 beef bulion cubes instead. We will add ham next time. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

Needed to add way more salt to the potatoes. Then had to put cheese on top to tempt the kids into eating it.

Very good flavor!  I did substitute the broth for the water as well and think it made it that much better!  It was a little mushy, and didn't look appetizing but the taste was definitely over the top!

This was Delicious!!! I loved the fact that it only required one pan... I baked the potatoes in the microwave most of the way and then sliced them before adding because I was afraid they wouldnt cook fast enough in the skillet, other than that I followed it exactly.  I will be definetly be making this again and again. Thank you!!!

I had extra cabbage left over some some colcannon that I made, and I had a bag full of baby red potato's so I found this recipe and decided to just use some smoked deli ham slices that I had in my fridge...I was skeptical about how it would turn out but it was very filling and wonderful!!

This was simple but tasted just like the individual parts of the dish...so no surprises on tasting.  Having said that it was healthy and hearty and would have been a much better alternative to the overboiled patatoes I used to make for my family as a "tween".  My family would have died and gone to heaven to come home to this :)

My Mother-In-Law made this recipe for her family for years, she always added the green beans to the mix as well. It is nice to see it in writing! It is a very forgiving recipe.  Tonight I used bacon instead of ham and added frozen green beans and new potatoes.  Very tasty.

My family positively LOVES this!!  It's on our once-a-month rotation. I do add butter to the skillet, once the cabbage is added, but that is the only modification I make.

I found the cabbage took on a very strong aroma. I thin the ham and potatoes were fab so next time I will leave out the cabbage and serve ith brocolli instead]

Everyone in the house loves this recipe. It's very quick and easy, especially since you can chop the ingredients earlier. We've used regular cabbage and Napa cabage. Perfect the way it is... no alterations needed.

This was simple and tasty.  However, next time I would add the ham with the onion and the potatoes at the same time as the cabbage.  As written it took forever for the potatoes to cook through.

Made this recipe for the first time, and it turned out delicious. I ate to servings myself it was so good. I used half a medium head of cabbage, which worked fine.

Excellent!  Made it twice in past month, once as written, and last night with turkey sausage instead of ham.  Good both ways.

I followed the recipe exactly and found this to be a bit bland for our taste.  I added some apple cider vinegar which helped some.  Probably will not use this recipe again.

Family loved it.  I used turkey ham instead of regular ham.  Added a few cloves of garlic.  Even 8 year old hogged it down.  This is a nice recipe to use to get you out of the daily rut !

This is very good. I followed the recipe as written with the exception of adding a red bell pepper (had one that needed to be used). Will make this again and maybe try some of the suggestions from other reviewers.

Super yummy!  I've been playing with versions of a skillet cabbage recipe, and this is the best I've ever tasted.  I did use a turkey polish sausage instead of ham to lower calories a bit, but I kept the butter and all the other ingredients the same.  This one isn't pretty, but very tasty and affordable.

We found this dish quite bland and had to add more seasoning. It did cook up fast with only the small amount of water though. I should have followed another reviewers suggestion to cube the potatoes because the slices did fall apart.

This is great for an occasional meal.  I halved the recipe and used a comination of ham and kiebelsa sausage.   I still had leftovers for three people.  It was excellent the second time around.

This is definately a comfort food.  The aroma while this was cooking was wonderful.  I could not wait to eat it.  I loved it.  The rest of my family seemed to enjoy it also.  I was hoping to eat the leftovers the next day for lunch, but someone beat me to it.  Thanks for the recipe.  It reminded me of my mom who used to make a dish very similar.

Great recipe, and easy to make. My daughter doesn't care for ham so I used smoked sausage instead. It was an instant hit with my family. I will be making it again and again.

This seems like a variation of an old Irish dish the Englished named "Bubbles and Squeak", because of the sounds it makes while cooking.  Very good w/o meat also.

I had this for dinner tonight and boy did it hit the spot.  I like my cabbage on the soft side so cooking it first worked for me using chicken broth instead of water.  I fried 2 cans sliced potatoes in butter with paprika and garlic powder covering the potatoes.  I salted the cabbage and added the potatoes.  I then fried the ham in the same pan as potatoes and then added to cabbage and potatoes.  Good easy dish.  Thank you.

good taste, easy to through together but i would reverse it a bit next time and try polish sausage instead of ham. 
i found the cabbage got too soft and mushy by the time the potatoes were done so next time i will try to put the potatoes in first then when almost finished put in the cabbage.

Made this last night and it was great. Followed other suggestions and cooked the onions and potatoes first, then added ham, then added cabbage last. Used chicken broth instead of water. Left out the salt and papricka. Added black pepper. Its even better after sitting overnight.Thanks for something different.

This was sent to me as the Allrecipies daily E-mail. It sounded good so I bought the cabbage & Ham on my way home from work. I pretty much stuck to the recipe only adding some Garlic powder. My wife and I both gave it a 4 1/2 so I rounded it up. It was easy to make and didn't take a lot of time. As with everything I salted & Peppered to taste. Nice recipe.

Very good! I used red potatoes so they did not fall apart. I served this with yellow cornbread, green beans and huge glasses of fresh milk.

Great!but I cooked the ham first with oil,then fried the cabbage and potatoes, covered it and let it simmer in it's own water until soft.

I was looking for a way to use the Honey Ham from the deli that was in my refrigerator...this was a very tasty quick meal with slow-cooked taste.  I pre-cooked the cubed potatoes (I used Yukon Gold) for about 5-6 minutes before adding to the skillet and this cut down significantly on the preparation time.   With sugar-cinnamon applesauce it made a complete meal with not many dishes to clean!

Very good. Made as written with the only change being I used vegetable broth instead of water- next time I'll use beef broth. I don't know why so many people changed the recipe, it came out great. Thanks.

I cheated!  I put everything into the crock pot...It was very tasty, but I'll never do that again!  The cabbage was way over cooked which made it taste a little bitter!  I will make again following the directions as everyone in my house loves cabbage and ham!!!  Thanks for such a good and easy recipe!  4 stars for the yummy flavor of the potatoes and ham!!!*****UPDATE***** I made it the correct way on the stove, am now changing it to 5 stars.  It was cooked just right and the taste was perfect (can't wait to go back for another little nibble!!!).  Thank You Priscilla!!

I read the reviews and did not know whether to try this or not. I did and it was very tasty. Yet others are right when they say it is not much to look at. It's not, not sure if the children will even try it, yet it is very good and I will probably scale it down for one next time. Thanks for sharing.

Taste wasn't bad, but it didn't look too nice and nobody other than myself wanted to it. Took much longer to cook than what is called for.

Very easy to prepare and much like the traditional Irish dish called boxty without the cakes to serve it with.

I've never been a great fan of cooked cabbage but my husband loves it.  I've tried this recipe exactly as written several times now and both of us have enjoyed it.  It is an excellent way to use up some of the extra cabbage from our garden.  Thanks for a great basic recipe.

I WOULD ADD FRESH GREEN BEANS WITH THE CABBAGE AND COOK TOGETHER.  NEEDS HIGHER/LONGER COOKING.
