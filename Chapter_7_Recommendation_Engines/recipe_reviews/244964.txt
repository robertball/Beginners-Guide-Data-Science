These tasted great--they really did. However, I do not think that they were simple. I have never made cake balls or pops before, and the instructions were lacking in getting me a decent finished product. 30 min in the fridge was not enough. When I poked the stick in and dipped into the chocolate, it promptly fell right off. I had to google some tips for making pops to get these to turn out correctly. (Such as freezing the dough before making balls and using Styrofoam to set them up in as they cool.)  I then only did half of them as cake "pops" and did the rest of them as "balls." I did like the way the instructions said to cool the cake, then stir the icing (which I had at room temp) into the crumbs. I loved the resulting texture of these cake pops.  (I know other people who have the cake warm, warm up the icing and even use an electric mixer to mix it all together. I'm not very fond of the overly gummy texture of cake pops/balls made this way.) I think for these to really be "simple," the instructions need more details on how to roll them so they stay together, how to keep them on the stick,  and what to do with them once you dip them. We used strawberry cake and icing with chocolate melts. My daughter loved them no matter how they looked!

Worked well, turned out yummy. Candy wafer melts in double boiler coated and held together good. Birthday Cake Pops success!

The finished product did not look great as the "pops" slipped off the sticks. But, according to my son, they tasted good albeit very sweet. We used white cake, buttercream, and white melts and ended up with 20 or so "snowballs".

We made Ned Stark cake pops for an office party. Theyâ€™re not easy, but we found the fridge is your friend.
