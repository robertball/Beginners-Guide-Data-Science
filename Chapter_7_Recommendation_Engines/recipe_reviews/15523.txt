I use this chicken recipe for a lighter version of my Chicken Parmesan because I like the fact that you bake the chicken instead of pan-frying.  The chicken is so moist, tender and delicious!  I use fresh grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, and seasoned Italian bread crumbs.  The last five minutes of baking I top the chicken with spaghetti sauce, mozzarella cheese and a sprinkle of additional Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.

I thought this recipe was extremely easy to make with an exceptional outcome. It looked like a fancy cook made it instead of me. I did make a few changes, not in the basic recipe, but added a spoonful of spaghetti sauce and mozzarella cheese to the top of the chicken pieces, placed them back in the oven to melt the cheese. They turned out great!!! I served it with salad and a side of buttered/garlic noodles...and it is now the meal I take to friends. Very good.

I make a Parmesan Chicken that is almost identical to this one that my family LOVES!  I cut boneless, skinless chicken breasts into 3-4 pieces and pound them out really thin, salt & pepper them, dredge in flour, then beaten egg and then in the breadcrumb/parmesan mixture.  Fry them up in 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil till golden brown!  Don't over cook them or the meat gets really dry.  If you do this one right the outside is very crispy & crunchy with a moist, juicy, tender inside.  One of my families favorite summertime comfort foods, hands down!  Serve with a chilled creamy potato salad and corn on the cob, YUM!  The ultimate comfort food!

This definitely is quick, easy and delicious! Great recipe for a lighter version of a classic dish. I used Italian style bread crumbs and along with other ingredients I added some garlic. I topped this with a tomato cream sauce and some mozzarella cheese during the last five minutes and served with angel hair pasta! Perfect with a garden salad and warm bread!

I have made this seversl times and have found it is even easier if you use the Italian bread crumbs, cheese, and eggs to coat the chicken then you don't even have to use seasoning, it tastes great.

I liked this one a lot. Very simple yet delicious. I added onion and garlic powders to the breadcrumb mixture which kicked the yummy factor up a notch. Note,however, that even slight overbaking will cause the chicken to dry out a lot so stick to the 35 minutes.

I made this for my boyfriend and his family and it was a hit!!! I mixed 2 tablespoons of chicken stock powder and 1 teaspoon of salt with the dry ingredients. It gave a little extra oomph to a what is a great, easy and cheap meal. I fried up some beans, red bell peppers and carrots for the side. Finding nice recipes like this is why i love allrecipes.com

Good as is, but even better with a few simple but important modifications. Rather than dipping the chicken in egg I dipped it in melted butter. Rather than "Italian seasoning" I used fresh parsley, sage, rosemary, oregano and fresh minced garlic.  Once coated in the crumb/cheese mixture I drizzled the chicken with some of the remaining melted butter.  Rather than a 350 degree oven I baked them at 400 degrees, 20-25 minutes, depending on the size of the chicken breasts.  Moist and juicy, fork tender with incredible fresh herb flavor.  Darned pretty too.  I served this with linguine and "Red Bell Pepper Coulis" (which was excellent, by the way), also from this site.

This was OK.  I added oregano, red pepper flakes, basil and garlic powder but still found it a little bland.  The breading didn't crisp like I would have liked. One issue that wasn't the recipe's fault was the store bought tomato sauce was exttemly bland as well.

Delicious recipe and the chicken was tender & juicy. This one is a keeper...family loved it!  I had 2 pkgs. of chicken breasts (12 total) so I tripled the ingredients (not the Italian seasoning bcuz I used Contadina Italian Style bread crumbs but added extra dry oregano and basil as well as pepper to the mixture).  I lightly salted both sides of the chicken breasts and let them sit for about 1/2 hour (to ensure flavor but also to retain the juices so that they would not dry out) and I did not flatten/pound them.  I also used shredded Parmesan cheese in the bread crumbs instead of the dry, grated kind.  I lightly greased both pans & baked on 350 degrees for about 55 minutes (I'm sure this extra time was needed bcuz I had so much chicken, most pieces were very thick & bcuz I had 2 pans in the oven).  When I turned chicken over, I topped them with Prego Tomato, Basil & Garlic (I heated two jars and added fresh minced garlic, a little salt, dry basil, dry oregano and a few squirts of ketchup) and shredded Mozzarella cheese, but turned the heat up to 375 & baked for another 20 minutes or so (cut in the middle of a thick one to check doneness).  I served it with spaghetti (2 boxes of Dreamfield low carb) mixing with leftover sauce (next time I will use 3 jars of sauce so that all the pasta gets coated well; I left some plain with butter bcuz there was not enough sauce), Caesar salad (Kraft Caesar, no croutons, and leftover shredded Parmesan cheese) and garlic & cheese Texas Toast.

I was torn between four or five stars, but opted to go for five because of how easy this is and the fact that there is no pan frying involved. I also added sauce and mozzarella at the end to spruce it up. I made several pieces without just to try it as written, but the sauce and cheese covered chicken was favorited by everyone. I used Italian bread crumbs instead of adding seasoning to regular ones. Next time I will add even more seasoning to the Italian bread crumbs in order to add more flavor. Thank you for the great recipe.

I halved this recipe for 2 chicken breasts, but they turned out wonderfully. Thanks for a great basic recipe that anyone can modify to suit their tastes!

This is a favorite of mine.  I have made it in a small batch for my family and I've made it in huge batches for almost 200 ladies.  You cannot go wrong with this!  I have used melted butter in place of the egg.  Either works great.  I've even breaded the breasts the night before and baked the next day.  Like I said, you cannot go wrong with this recipe.  Tried and true.  A favorite in our rotation!

This is a quick recipe that tastes great. I always add more seasoning than it calls for and I flip the chicken every 10 minutes so the bread crumbs dont get as soggy.

Absolutely delicious!  I used Italian Bread crumbs and didn't add any Italian seasoning.  Served with Grandma's buttered noodles (from Allrecipes.com) and carrots/snow peas.  Also made Sweet Dinner Rolls (from Allrecipes.com).  Dessert - Tapioca.  My family gave me a standing ovation (seriously)!  :)

I've made this recipe twice and it was wonderful, although I did make one slight modification.  As others observed, about 20 minutes into the cooking time, the coating appeared very dry.  So, I melted some butter and drizzled a bit over each chicken breast.  The coating browned beautifully and crisply, and the inside was very juicy and tender.  Very simple recipe, very delicious results.  I'll make this again and again.

I used 2 lbs. chicken tenders and cracker crumbs for the bread crumbs.  I topped with sauce and mozzarella.  We all thought it was a good take on Parmesan Chicken, but it really, really needs salt.

This was a really great recipe. I did make a few changes. I added some garlic and onion powder to the breadcrumb mixture and after coating the breasts I seared each side in a pan with olive oil for about 2 minutes per side before baking. This helped keep the crust crispy. I served with melted asiago cheese and marinara sauce on top. Added a side of fresh green beans and angel hair pasta and it was delicious! Definitely will make this again.

This was great!!!!! very simple and one of the best baked chicken breast dishes I have tasted. I use Italian seasoned bread crumbs and left out the Italian seasoning, I dip my chicken in butter instead of egg. Also I added onion powder, paparika and seasoning salt to the dry mix. Very very Good!!!!!!

This was ok, but no one in the house REALLY liked it.  My husband thought it was too dry, my nephew thought it too bland, and I was not blown away.  It is a good, simple recipe and works well for a quick fix, but not something I would routinely serve.

Very easy and delicious. The only thing I changed was adding mozzarella cheese on top of chicken.

This is a very good dish, great flavor. I seasoned the chicken first and used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. I also melted 2 teaspooms of butter in the baking dish prior to adding the chicken. I had cabbage and angel hair garlic buttered pasta. Yum. My family loved it. I will repeat this dish.

I thought this chicken was 'meh'.  I made the recipe exactly as stated.  It was good enough but nothing special.  If you made added a tomato sauce and some mozzarella like for a chicken parmesan it would definitely kick it up a lot.  As it is written here though, its kind of plain.

It cooked for longer, but the coating is good.  What will make or break this chicken is the side served with it.  Just on its own, it is too dry.

This is a simple great recipe. 2 things I added make a big difference: I add about 1 tsp of lemon juice to the egg, and I sprinkle Adobo to the bread crumb/cheese mixture. The taste is so great!!

Wonderful recipe! My husband and I loved it! I topped the chicken with mozzerella cheese and tomato sauce (with 5 minutes to go in the baking process), and it was delicious. I will definitely make this again! Thanks for the recipe!

You're right Jenny.  This is definately a recipe that you can change the amount used of ingredients and count on a fabulous meal!  (I would stick with the ingredients listed though and not use, for instance, different cheeses.)  I've made this many times since first reading it here at Allrecipes and have never been disappointed.  I've settled on more paremesan than bread crumbs and it's fantastic!  Last night I tried the same mixture and method using halibut and cod.  I cooked it at the same temp for 20 minutes and even I (who hates fish) liked it.  Hubby was THRILLED!  Thank you SO MUCH for sharing this recipe Jenny.  It will be a regular at our house!

Simply Parmesan Chicken Haiku: "Breading slid right off. Didn't get very crispy. But texture was good." Best part about this chicken was the inside texture was perfectly moist. I didn't change a thing about the recipe, despite reading many additions and adjustments in reviews, and we found that the breading didn't stick well at all, and the flavor was kind of the "needed-jazz" spectrum. Still, we spooned marinara sauce on top and that helped.

It is great to send you in the right direction! I dip the chicken in the egg and bread crumbs then pan fry the outside in olive oil because it provides a crispier crust. In my house; the crispier the better! :)Then I put it in the pan cover with marinara sauce bake them 30-35 min add cheese and put back in until its melted. I also use boneless skinless chicken thighs because they are much juicier. I flatten them in a plastic bag.

tasted yummy, but super disappointed that the tomato sauce wasn't added to the ingredient list, calorie consideration, etc. what the heck? It's not even acknowledged! good thing my other half is a decent enough cook to notice. my diet is shaking its fist at you.

This has quickly become a favorite of mine.  I use an extra egg so I can 'double dip' in egg and bread crumb mixture.  This makes a thicker breading, which is not only delicious but also keeps the chicken from drying out so much.  YUM!

A perfectly simple Parmesan chicken. I only wanted to cook 2 chicken breast, so I just eye-balled the rest of the ingredients. We used homemade buttery bread crumbs. They turned out wonderful, with plenty of flavor. We served with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. Delicious!

Yummy and very tasty--hubby gave it two thumbs up! However, I did add some salt to the cheese and crumb mix and I had to both increase the oven temp to 375F and the cooking time to 45 min. I used large chicken breasts so maybe that was it. I'll definitely make this again and again! Impressive looking enough for guests, too!

This chicken was awesome! I love the fact that is not fried but it tastes sooo good! Hubby loved it. So flavorful. The only think I will change next time is to cut down on the dried bread crumbs and grated Parm cheese because after breading 6 chicken breasts, I still had too much crumb mixture left. I gave it 25min then turned for another 10mi. Absolutely delicious!! Will def make over and over again. Thanks for sharing the recipe Jenny!

Really moist.
Baked in toaster oven for 30 minutes then turned it off and topped with sauce and cheese and left it in the oven until the cheese melted.  Served with whole wheat pasta topped with veggies.  Yum!

This was the first time for making this, and I used some fairly plump chicken breasts. They weren't quite as done or as flavorful as I prefer. I might try pounding them thin and then adding in onion and garlic next time to they are more to my liking. My son liked it better than I did!

Delicious traditional supper. The changes I made were I let the chicken breasts soak in buttermilk all day and instead of bread crumbs I used crumbled corn bread. I also left out the egg, since the buttermilk works better anyway.

Great recipe! I used cornbread stuffing mix and it made a great crust. I would recommend using olive oil and spraying pan. I flipped chicken breast after 20 minutes and placed pasta sauce over chicken breast and topped with mozzarella cheese for remaining time.  It had a great golden cheese crust and great taste.

This was a big hit in my home. I added bread dip seasoning to the Bread Crumb mixture. I also drained a can of Diced Tomatoes then spread the Tomatoes onto the Breaded Chiken along with Broccoli florets then sprinkled shredded Mozzerella and Feta cheese and baked for about 30 min. This was AMAZING! The left overs were great as well. The next day I put some fresh basil leaves in the food processor with extra Virgin Olive Oil and blended it together and spread that onto store bought pizza dough (Pilsbury). I cut the chicken into little squares and spread it onto the dough along with a little bit of frozen spinach and baked until the dough was a nice toasted color about 20-25 min. I must say it made for the best Chicken pizza I have ever had!

This is an excellent recipe! The chicken came out juicy and delicious. I sprinkled my chicken pieces with a little salt before breading and baking. This was fantastic even without any sauce or cheese toppings. This was as tasty as the fried method. I served this with garlic/parmesan pasta on the side. We all loved this dish. Thanks, this is a new favorite here!

I tried this last night, I omitted the Italian seasoning but like many others I added the pasta sauge and mozzarella at the end.  I made it with a side of rotini (with the same sauce and mozzarella) and easy garlic bread. It was wonderful. It was SO tender. it wa sthe best chicken i've EVER made. :)  My fiance Loved it. and he's a picky eater

Excellent recipe.  I coated the chicken with mayonaisse instead of egg and it came out very moist.  More fattening but also juicier.  My family loved it!

This is almost exactly what I use when I pan fry my Chicken Parmesan.  I use the Italian Bread crumbs and pan fry in 1/2 olive oild and 1/2 butter.  Top with tomato sauce with some italian spices and mozarella cheese about 5 min before you want to serve it.

EASY!  Took longer to bake than it said, but not a problem.  I put it with rotini pasta and a white sauce (butter, flour, basil, milk, and garlic) - overall, could have used a bit more flavor but that's easily done.  Thanks!

We thoroughly enjoy this recipe for its taste and simplicity.  I dip the boneless chicken breasts in melted butter instead of egg for more richness.  Bread crumbs, grated parmesan cheese, oregano, parsley, and S&P make up the coating.  Bake at 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes for perfectly moist, delicious chicken breasts.  Couldn't ask for an easier entree!

I used Italian bread crumbs AND Italian seasoning...I was worried it might be overwhelming but it was absolutely delicious.  So easy to make and full of flavor!  The recipe proportions were perfect for the amount of chicken.  This will definitely become a regular dish.  Thanks for sharing, Jenny.

This was good but it did not crisp up at all.  It was rather mushy with sauce and noodles.  At lease it tasted good.

Amazing! I added a generous pinch of red pepper flakes, a oich of garlic powder, and some S & P. Also sliced the chicken into strips and baked at 200deg C for twenty minutes. Added a little butter to the pan before laying down the chicken. So good! The chicken was juicy and tender, and so flavorful. Will make again and again.

Really good and easy! Rubbed chicken with tony's.   Used Panko crumbs because that is what I had.....doubled the crumb recipe....added onion, garlic powder....doubled eggs.  After 35 min cooking I put jar of marinara and cheese, put back into oven until melted.

Took readers advice and salt and pepper chicken first.  Then dipped in egg and Italian bread crumbs. Cook 30 min, flipping chicken half way through. Added fresh parensian cheese to top during the last five minutes of baking.

This receipe was fantastic.  I had never had Parmesan Chicken before but I am hooked now.  I used Panko Bread cumbs and added the italian seasoning.  My hubby loved this and said I could put this in the regular rotation of meals.  Yum, thanks for the great receipe.

This is now a favorite. I used chicken tenderloins and put some salt and pepper on before I dredged it in the egg and crumb mixture. Also, instead of bread crumbs, I threw some old wheat crackers in the food processor and then mixed it with the parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning.  I covered the chicken and popped it into the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. The chicken turned out very very tasty and deliciously moist.

I didn't find this to be of anything special.  Only difference is, I used shreddeded Parmesan instead of grated because I didn't have any.  Not sure if that makes a big difference or not.  Needed a little bit more of something.  Maybe salt the chicken a little bit first.  And I used a little cooking spray on the pan.  Not sure if I want to try this again or not.

My family likes this. I make my own ww seasoned bread crumbs and italian seasoning. I also make sure that all of the chicken pieces are uniform in size. I took them out at about 25 min & they were perfect. Easy, peasy!

I really enjoyed the recipe. I did things a bit different though. As normal I mixed the Parmesan cheese with the bread crumbs and I baked it. About half way through baking it, I took it out, coated it once in straight Parmesan cheese, dipped it in spaghetti sauce, and topped it with mozzarella cheese. I then let it cook the rest of the way. It was amazing over spaghetti.

This is by far the most delicious, moist way to eat chicken.  I love the simplicity and the yummy taste....the cheese is so flavorful.  I serve it with angel hair pasta and marina sauce.

I made these last night. The chicken was very moist. Overall, very tasty. I wanted it to brown more than it did in a 350 oven though, so I switched to broil for the last few minutes to crisp up the outside a little.

I use italian bread crumbs and add a touch of sea salt.  I dip large, frozen, boneless, skinless chicken breasts into veg oil, then bread, and bake for 35-40 mins at 400.  I do not flip. Turns out moist every time, and my family and guests love it!

Easy to prepare and very moist!  I did not find this dry at all.  I imagine if you overcook, it could become that way.  I baked mine for 25 min., then flipped before baking another 5 min.  I also salted and peppered the breasts before placing them in the egg wash.  Will make again.

My kids were crazy about this recipe!  When the chicken was done, I did add a slice of Provolone cheese and a spoonful of spaghetti sauce to the top of each piece and put it back in the oven for a few minutes.

this is very much like the recipe i have been making forever.  i also add add'l seasonings to my breadcrumbs and the egg (like salt/pepper/garlic powder) and i have found that if i have extra time i will pound the breasts to about 1/2" thick as it makes them super tender, you just need to adjust your cooking time accordingly!

This was wonderful, the whole "picky" family ate it all up!  I did modify by adding italian dressing to the egg mixture and used garlic/italian bread crumbs, like another reviewer suggested, and this was great.  Served with green beans and red potatoes and there was none left.  Thank you for sharing!

I was looking for a quick and easy chicken dish to add to my spaghetti dinner. This turned out to be very moist and tender; using Italian breadcrumbs gave it extra seasoning. Saved this one to my recipe box!

My favorite chicken parmesan is this similar recipe, but cooked in skillet on stovetop. This oven baked chicken turned out ok, but not nearly as juicy as my skillet cooked. So, I'd say this is an ok recipe, but not fab - thus three stars. I might make it again because it's easy, but no one raved.

Man this is easy. The only thing I did different is cut boneless, skinless breasts in half, soak them in a mixture of enough beaten eggs to cover them, with garlic, olive oil, Italian seasoning mixed in for a few hours. I kinda wiped off the egg as much as I could and coated with a bit more olive oil before breading. Soaking in egg is good for any type of chicken that you plan on breading. Makes it tender!

Oh my. We had this last night.  It was delicious.  This is a great recipe for a quick by elegant night.  We paired it with some plain 'ol out of the jar spaghetti sauce and pasta on the side.  The chicken was tender and moist and the breading provided just the right texture.  Thanks for posting this!  We'll be having this often!

Honey, this recipe was so simple and so delicious and juicy that it's become an overnight staple for us.  Plus, my fiance loved the chicken so much he had it again for lunch the next day (which is a rarity!).

Just a note if you happen to have left-over's: Warm the chicken up and place on toasted italian bread, spoon on some red sauce, with grated parmesean cheese sprinkled on top.  Delicious!

Thanks again for the recipe!

This is that dish that makes the rotation a few times per month in the warmer months-I like a salad on the side. I keep it simple and use one skillet, if it needs to be more crisp, fire up the broiler and throw it under.

Love this recipe. I do alot of "oven fried" chicken but this was different. I used freshly grated parmesania reggianna, Italian bread crumbs, using a slightly more cheese to crumb ratio with 2tsp. oregano and a little salt.  The result was moist, tender and wonderfully flavored chicken, that was easy to prepare.

I made this recipe for the first time when company was over, so I was a little nervous about how it might turn out.  But everyone loved it!  It was really yummy, seasoned just enough, but not so overwhelming that you couldn't taste the chicken.  My husband, one of the pickiest eaters I know, still raves about it and has asked me to make it again soon.  He likes the way it tastes; I like how easy it was to make!

I usually make dinner or dessert at least once a month once school's out and this is probably one of the easiest recepies I've ever made.  I substituted seasoned stuffing for the breadcrumbs and it turned out awesome.  Even my Little sister who Hates cheese loved this recepie.

I'm going to give this recipe 5 stars for simplicity, ease and speed of prep and all around flavor. I used chicken tenders rather than whole breasts, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. My husband and son loved them and my husband said, "This is the most tender chicken I've ever tasted." The temp and cooking time is perfect. The chicken is so tender you'll be able to cut it with a spoon. No need to "add more cheese-sauce-butter, as some other reviewers have suggested.  This one is simple and delicious. The flavor of the chicken shines through.

Very easy and quick to make... Very good too. I did put my own spin on it by dipping my chicken in flour then egg with 2 tbsp. of water and then instead of just bread crumbs, I used 1 cup bread crumbs and 1 cup Panko mixed with parmesan. Then drizzled with a little melted butter to make sure the chicken stay crisp and juicy.

This was amazing. My fiance and my father both loved it! I used italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of mixing it. Also I added mozzarella cheese and prego sauce to the top and stuck it into the oven again to melt the cheese. Then served it over angel hair pasta with a side salad.(:

This is a keeper. Chicken was very moist, however I did make a few changes. First I made my own bread crumbs, took some slices of bread put in the oven till they dried out about 20 min at 350. then I took a packet of zesty Italian salad dressing dry mix and add it to the bread crumbs. the dry mix salad dressing you can find in the salad dressing aisle. I used a spag sauce to top the chicken with slices of swiss cheese.

This was delicious and oh so easy!! I had gone to the store, cooked it, and had it on the table in an hour. I used fresh basil and added more than it called for. I just realized that I forgot the egg. Oops. The bread crumbs stuck to the chicken just fine though.

This was a great dish! I did add 2 tsp of garlic powder to the breading mix but otherwise followed instructions and was very happy with the result! I think it could have used a little more seasoning, but the texture was nice and it was very easy to put together and baked up very nicely!

Two slight modifications:  1)  Added Pasta sauce to the bottom of pan  2) 10 min prior to pulling from oven added melted butter over the breading [this browned it] and broiled it for 2 minutes.  Very good.

Quick and easy to make.  A bit bland, even though I used Italian bread crumbs and also added the Italian seasoning.  The bottom was soggy and flipping it over 5 minutes at the end did not help.

This was so simple and so good. I made a quick marinara and added mozzarella to the tops of the chicken to melt during the last couple of minutes of cooking. I also baked the chicken.  So, so good!

This was a great, quick and easy meal. I did however change it up a bit. I added some salt, pepper and garlic powder to the bread crumbs. I also, put a little marinara in the bottom of the baking dish and topped the chicken with more sauce and mozzarella. Very yummy!! I will make this again.

I added spaghetti sauce and some more parmesan on top during the last few minutes of cooking. Served it with noodles and it was fantastic! The husband and best friends all thought it was great. Super easy too! I will definitely be making this more often.

Very good, and very moist. Everyone liked it. I realized that my parmesan had gone bad just before I started to make this. So I used blue cheese crumbles instead (eyeballed the amount), and it smelled and tasted great. Can't wait to try this with some fresh parmesan.

This chicken is a keeper. It is moist and tasty.  I did however, add dash and extra garlic powder to my bread crumbs. I used fresh parmesan cheese and not the canned cheese. It is now a favorite and will make it again.  My family loved it and I have two very good cooks to impress.

This recipe for chicken was very easy and tasty. My 4 year old whom I can never seem to please asked for thirds!  I thought the flavor was nice but it wasnt a strong flavor. The chicken was so moist and tender, just how we like it. I will definately make again.

I was looking forward to trying this, because chicken Parmesan is my favorite dish. But I couldn't really taste the Parmesan in this chicken coating. Good in concept, but I will stick to plain bread crumbs next time.

I purchased thinly sliced chicken breasts, then did the breading and fried them in a pan with just a little bit of butter.  Then I kept them warm at 200 degrees in the oven until it was time to serve.  They were a hit!

I tried this recipe for the first time, and my whole family loved it, they said it was the best chicken I have ever made.  Thanks so much for this recipe I will definitely be using it again in the future.  I did change it up a little bit though, I added seasonings to the breading before I put it on the chicken, it was definitely a hit at my house.

GOOD..but I made some revisions. I added about a teaspoon of garlic powder, half a teaspoon of onion powder, a dash of cayenne, some smoked and regular paprika, a good amount of thyme and some dried chives! Lots of flavour and no need to add salt as the parm already contains enough! Thanks for the recipe. Oh, and instead of egg wash, I brushed each breast with about half a tablespoon of peppercorn ranch dressing before coating.

This was fantastic. The breading was amazing, great flavor. I pan fried in 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter, turned out great. Everyone loved it!

This is my new Parmesan chicken recipe. It's very simple and it tastes good, two important factors for me. I cut four chicken breasts in half while they were still slightly frozen, so they wouldn't be so thick (I hate pounding them down - messy). I didn't change much, except to add a little garlic salt to the Parmesan/crumb mixture, and I didn't turn the breasts over as indicated because the breading was coming off when I tried to flip one. I added marinara and topped with a four cheese mixture. My family gobbled it up.

This was very easy to make and easy to clean up too. I lined the baking sheet with foil sprayed with olive oil. toss foil and you're done with cleaning. I used wheat bread crumbs, and added garlic powder, black pepper, and minced dried onion along with Italian seasoning. So Healthy and my kids loved it ! Just be careful not to overbake. The breading will burn and chicken will be hard and dry.

This was good! 30 minutes was a tiny bit too much time cause I cut my chicken breasts into strips so that there'd be more  surface area for the crumb mixture, but it was still tasty. I used freshly grated Parm. I also added about a 1/4-1/2 tsp each of cayenne pepper (I add cayanne to almost every chicken recipe), onion powder, and garlic salt. I also added (in the last 5 minutes) spaghetti sauce and shredded mozzarella as suggested by another reviewer. It really kicked it up a notch. Enjoy!

This chicken was awesome. But I need someone to tell me how to keep the breading on the bottom of the chicken from getting soggy. I don't know if it's the type of baking dish i used or what. But overall, this chicken tasted really great. At the end I put some red sauce and cheese on top then put it back in to let the cheese melt, and served with pasta.

This is a good recipe, however I made some changes, hence the 4 stars. I don't know what "Italian" seasoning is and I couldn't find it here in Poland, so I used 1/2 dill and 1/2 savory. I also used fresh breadcrumbs so I had to increase the volume of crumbs by 50%. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of white pepper and a dash of seasalt. It was a good idea! A few notes: 1) I doubled the breadmix and still didn't have enough. Next time I will triple it, as this is a mild mix and should be quite thick. 2) Next time I will mix the egg with the breadmix first, then roll the chicken as I had trouble getting the spices, cheese and breadcrumbs evenly spread on the chicken. it tended to separate. 3)Be sure to grate the parmesan very finely, and also the breadcrumbs. 4) I found that in my new oven it cooked to perfection uncovered at 350 in 40 to 45 minutes, turning only once, after 25 minutes. 5)Serve with pasta, but tomato based pasta doesn't go well, at least with the dill version. I used pre-made honey mustard pasta sauce with sautayed red pepper added, and used those little shell pasta pieces and the flavor went VERY well with the coating on the chicken.
But I will make this again, for sure!

I made my own bread crumbs w/ italian seasonings. Flattened the chicken & I added marinara & fresh mozarella after the chicken was done baking.   I thought it was rather dry.  I guess I was thinking it would turn out crunchy. Probably won't make again.

It tasted good and was juicy but the crust wasnt getting crisp in the oven so I had to broil for a couple minutes. It took alot longer than 35 minutes though.

Uber easy and nice flavour, perfect for a weeknight dinner. Cooked the chicken in a pan because the oven was busy but will broil it next time.

This WAS quick and easy, and the chicken DID come out tender and juicy, but I can't say I was all that impressed with the flavor.  I used shredded mozzarella instead of the shredded parmesan, but I think if I make this again I will use cheddar to spruce it up a little.  IF I make this again...

I couldn't believe how tender and juicy this turned out!  I didn't have any fresh parmesan but it was still good.  I might use a little less italian seasonings as it was a little strong for my taste.  I like the idea of putting spaghetti sauce on top - I'll have to try that.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I took another reviewer's advice and topped the chicken w/ spaghetti sauce and I added a little more parmesan cheese on the top for presentation purposes.  I served it over a spaghetti w/ a tossed salad and it really like it.

To me, it was missing "something".  Maybe salt???  I followed the recipe exactly as is.  Next time, I will add salt to see if that does it for me.  My kids were happy with it, and it is a good base chicken recipe.  It is quick and easy to throw together as well.  I will keep it around.  Thanks for sharing!

This came out great. Pretty simple recipe for days when you don’t have a lot of time. I ended up putting the oven at 400f and used a few more chicken breasts. I also topped with pasta sauce. Kids approved :).

I made this dish for a family of 6 and three of the 6 are extremely picky eaters.  It was a hit!  I really like this option as a bake only approach which rules out the need to fry the chicken prior to baking.  The chicken was near perfect with the recommended cooking time and only really varies with the oven you use.  Fire it up and enjoy!!!!

This was really good.  It's healthier than frying the chicken.  I did spray the pan so it didn't stick.  I put the broiler on for a couple of minutes to make it a little crispier.  The only (other) things I did different was to add cayenne pepper to the egg, and we only use Romano cheese.  That really took it to the next level, I think.  It had a strong Romano cheese flavor and we love that.  Will definitely make again.  I hate frying chicken breast, so we rarely have chicken cutlets like this at home.  Thank you!

I made it but of course I changed it up a little. I seasoned the cutlets with a little Adobo then coated them with flour before dipping them in the eggs.  After the beadcrumb and Parmesan I sprinkled them with extra virgin olive oil which I also coated the pan with. Baked at 400 degree for 20-25.  Delicious!

I loved that this was such a simple recipe! It came out great. Next time I will use thinner chicken breast, because I had to keep it in the oven quite a bit longer. I will definitely do this again and post pictures with my review.

Only changes I made did not substantially change the recipe (to be fair to the rating system). I ponder the chicken breast to about 1/2" for uniform cooking; I used half panko/half Italian bread crumbs; still added the extra Italian seasoning. I also added a few tablespoons of milk to the egg mixture to make it go a little further. My oven was otherwise occupied so I pan fried the chicken in a little olive oil. Some family members topped theirs with marinara and shredded mozzarella and others ate it plain ... all gave it great reviews. Served it with spaghetti squash tossed with olive oil, salt and pepper.

Have I had better chicken Parmesan? Yes. Was it more labor intensive and higher in fat? Yes. This is an easy, tasty, relatively healthy weeknight option. I put some spaghetti sauce and mozzarella cheese on top and broiled for the last 5 minutes.

This was delicious! Absolutely unbelievably good. My husband hates leftovers and he couldn't get enough of this! I sliced mozzarella instead of shredding it. I'll definitely be making this again. The only bummer is the cooking time. Worth it!

This recipe was featured on the AR Home page a few days ago.  It looked good, so I decided to try it.  I pounded my chicken to about 1/2” for even cooking and seasoned it with garlic salt.  I made half the parmesan/crumb mixture for two large chicken breast halves.  I dusted the chicken with flour, then dipped in egg, then the crumb mixture.  As I do with all recipes like this, I only coated one side of the chicken breast, which ensures no soggy bottom.  I baked mine at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes and popped them under the broiler just long enough to get a nice golden color, then melted some provolone on top and served with some spaghetti sauce.  These were perfectly cooked and still quite moist.  We enjoyed these and I would make them again.  Next time I might drizzle some melted butter over the coated breasts before baking

Loved it!  Very easy and quick. Next time I will try to put the chicken on a rack so the breading doesn't get soggy from the chicken juices. I also used the Italian bread crumbs instead of adding the seasoning to regular bread crumbs and added spaghetti sauce and cheese during the last 5 minutes of baking.

We like this a lot.  It's very tasty and easy to prepare.  The only thing I add is a TBS of potato flakes  into the crumb mixture.  With or without its a definite 5 stars!

I love this recipe because it is so simple and so easy to adapt. My whole family loved it even with store bought pasta sauce (which usually is a big no no around here).

I was eager to try this recipe as I often make healthier baked chicken and pork dishes and did not make any alterations to the recipe.  Overall I felt it was overwhelmed by the Italian seasoning.  I would maybe consider adding garlic or marinating the chicken ahead of time to give it more depth of flavor.  Overall, just kind of 'eh'.

Delicious!  I used chicken tenders instead of breasts b/c that's what I had on hand.  I knew that I'd need to reduce the cooking time.  But, I still over cooked them a bit.  (They were a tiny bit dry).  Nevertheless, my family loved them!  The only change that I made to the recipe was seasoning the chicken with salt, pepper, & Creole seasoning before dipping in the beaten egg.  Oh! I also used Italian style bread crumbs and reduced the Italian seasoning to 1 teaspoon.  Still quite yummy!  I really don't think you can mess this recipe up!

Absolutely wonderful. I made this for my family and friends and everyone loved it. I used italian bread crumbs and i put some pasta sauce on top of the cooked chicken along with a little more parmesan. It was so yummy and so easy.

This was simply amazing.  Per the other tips, I did pre-seasoned bread crumbs and added mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce the last five minutes of cooking.  But this dish was so easy to make and most importantly, my husband loved it!  This will definitely be added in my dinner rotation.

My husand and I loved this, and I liked how easy it was to make.  I didn't realize I was out of eggs so I melted butter to dip the chicken in.  I added spaghetti sauce and mozzerella cheese when it was almost done cooking.

This is  so simple and quick! I didn't have bread crumbs so I substituted with Shanke'n'Bake and added the parmesan and Italian seasoning to that.  I also added garlic powder.  It was so good! We will definitely be making it again soon.

My 15-year-old son made this for dinner.  It was very easy and tasty. He decided to add some lemon at the end for a bit more flavor.  (Not something I would have thought of with Parmesan cheese, but he said he liked it.)  Not quite a 5-star dish, but very good and everyone liked it.  We will keep it on the list for future dinners.

This was just okay for me.  Probably would have given 3 stars but family liked it.  I followed the recipe with the exception of using panko instead of bread crumbs.

Delicious! This was quick and easy. With an easy cleanup too. I put 1 1/2 tsp italian seasoning and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. That was the only changed I made. Will be making this again :)

THIS WAS A GREAT, SIMPLE RECIPE! I DID MAKE A FEW MINOR CHANGES. I USED JUST THE EGG WHITE FOR DIPPING MY CHICKEN IN AND THEN COATED THE CHICKEN IN THE DRY MIXTURE. THE CHICKEN TURNED OUT SLIGHTLY CRISPY WITH WONDERFUL FLAVOR.ONCE THE CHICKEN WAS FULLY COOKED, I TOPPED THE CHICKEN WITH SMALL AMT OF STORE BOUGHT SPAGHETTI SAUCE AND MOZZARELLA CHEESE AND BAKED UNTIL THE CHEESE MELTED. I HAVE MADE THIS SEVERAL TIMES NOW AND WILL ADD IT TO MY ROTATION!

Nothing could be easier!  I used pre-packaged Italian style bread crumbs instead of the italian seasoning.  Fast, easy and delicious.

My husband and I LOVED this recipe, and it was so easy.  The next time I make it, I'll pound the chicken flat first because we loved the breading so much.  Thanks for sharing, this is going in to our regular rotation.

This was a fantastic meal! My 3.5 year old gobbled them up. I cut the breasts into strips to make them bake faster (15-20 minutes). I added some marinara sauce over the top and served with pasta. Perfect and quick!

i thought it was pretty good. my husband loved it. it was super easy to make. i used shredded parmesan instead of grated, because that's what i had. next time i will use grated instead, i think it would give it a better crunch. as other reviewers suggested i added some mozzerela at the end, which mixed with the breadcrumbs and parmesan really well.  i laid it over spaghetti and sauce.

Very simple to make. I use boneless chicken tender and add addtional seasoning. Comes out well seasoned and great crisy texture. These are better than the frozen breaded chicken that you buy in the store.

I give this recipe 5-stars based on how yummy it is without any modifications AND how versatile it is. This is a regular staple when I want dinner in a hurry because I always have the ingredients in the pantry. I've switched over to using olive oil instead of the egg though. Just drizzle the oil over the chicken and saves the extra step!

It was very good.  I added sauce and Motz. cheese about 5 minutes before I took it out of the oven.  Next time I'll just use the Italian bread crumbs instead of mixing everything up.

Not only was this recipe super easy and quick but my hubby even told me I could make it again and he's not a fan of chicken breasts (unless doused in lots of BBQ sauce).  I made the recipe as written.  I can only imagine if you take the other suggestions of spaghetti sauce and mozzarella cheese that it would be even tastier. A+++++

This is a new favorite at our house.  It was super easy and delicious. I prefer dark meat, so I used bone in chicken thighs and increased the baking time to 45 minutes.  I also sprinkled on some of the leftover breadcrumb mixture and covered the baking dish for the first 30 minutes to sort of steam the coating.  It was wonderful!

Good, simple recipe. I use a similar recipe for making baked parmesan chicken, although soak the chicken in italian dressing instead of egg. I liked the way it turned out with the egg better. We used this chicken to have in caesar salad and it worked nicely. I will use this recipe again.

I followed this recipe exactly (pounded the chicken to even it out), and while it did turn out very moist, the flavor was somewhat lacking.  I might make it again, but would definitely tweak it to give it additional flavor.

This was wonderful. I made this for Mother's Day dinner and my family raved about it. Moist, flavorful (added basil, celery salt and garlic powder to the breadcrumbs), went great with salad. My mom said, "This is a keeper!" and I agree. Thanks for the awesome recipe.

Wow, this was better than I expected! the chicken turned out nice and juicy, and the breading was pretty good. The hubby asked if I could use a different cheese next time, because he thought the breading was too dry.

We liked this, it was really easy to make but wasn't anything special. Just something easy with minimal prep. The only difference I would make next time would be to pound my chicken thinner before breading it.

Yummy delish!  I took some other reviewers suggestions and used fresh parm and added tomato sauce and mozzarella the last 5 or 10 minutes of baking time.  Very good over pasta tossed w/ butter or oil and seasoning.

This recipe was very easy, but the coating did not seem to stick well to the chicken. Next time I would probably use less Italian seasoning and incorporate some other herbs into the breading.

This is great and quick!  I pounded the chicken into thin cutlets, used Italian bread crumbs (so skipped the seasoning), and used fresh grated parmesan cheese.  It came out very tender and juicy.  Served this with Orzo with Parmesan and Basil from this site - very yummy.

My husband and I both give this recipe a 4.5 rating.  Very, very tasty.  They were in the oven about 27 minutes or so.  I just used 2 very large chicken breasts that I cut up in 5 medium-small pieces.  I put more Parmesan cheese on each side a couple of minutes before taking them out.  I served these with the Traditional Mashed Potatoes recipe also on this site.  Yummy!

Good recipe.  However, I recommend pounding the chicken thinly and serving over a bed of baby greens tossed in caesar dressing.  Hmmm.... that sounds good!  Maybe I should post that as a new recipe!

Very good, easy to make, i added some mixed-up salt to it based on reviews saying it needs more flavor, and found that while by itself probably not flavorful enough, but served with a honey mustard dipping sauce, it was perfect. great staple recipe didn't have to go to the store and quick and easy. :)

Great and quick to make, but next time I'd add some mozzarella cheese on top.

I didn't have bread crumbs so I used herb seasoned dressing which I turned into crumbs with a rolling pin and ziploc bag. I added the remaining ingredients to the bag and dropped the egg coated chicken into the bag to coat.   Easy and delicious.

Excellent!  I put a little Italian seasoning on the chicken before I dipped it into the egg for extra flavor.  I served the chicken over spaghetti noodles then topped with chunky vegetable spaghetti sauce and freshly grated parmesan cheese.  The chicken was nice and crispy on the outside, and incredibly juicy on the inside.  My husband and I loved it!  I will definitely make this again.

The kids like this a lot. My husband and I found it okay. The kids would give it 4 stars. I had to increase the baking temperature to 375. I like it served with a honey mustard dipping sauce on the side.

We just LOVED this!  This was soooooo good and soooooo easy.  I used boneless thighs as that is what we like.  As others stated, WAY too much of the breadcrumb mixture.  This just melted in your mouth.  Thanks for sharing!  Totally simple yet nice enough for company.

This was quick and simple and pretty good.  I served it over penne pasta with bottled spaghetti sauce and simple side salad with italian dressing and topped it with fresh parmesan and chopped italian parsley.

My husband loved this dish.  I used italian breadcrumbs, and added some garlic powder and red pepper flakes to suit our tastes.  The chicken itself was moist, and went well with a side of sauteed veggies.

Made this recipe for a couples shower (had 30 people here).  Very easy.  I did use frozen chicken breast and instead of just italian break crumbs, I used some panko bread crumbs too.  Tasty and a lot of praise.  Was a little bland as some of the other reviews have said so next time, I may marinate the chicken in marsala or something.

This is very good dinner. I made it exactly according recipe and it was excelent, Just if you like it crispy, turn your broiler on too. I also made it once with marinara or some spagheti sauce and mozzarela and it was excelent too. My hubby really enjoyed it. Thanks.

My two small children loved this.  I didn't think it was all that exciting, but if the kids ask for seconds, it must be great!
