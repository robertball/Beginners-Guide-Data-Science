I made a pitcher of these. Used a 46oz. of vegetable juice, 1 cup; and a couple of splashes of Vodka, and celery seed. And the rest of the seasonings to taste. [I'd say close to a Tbls.] Very good recipe.

I made this for brunch and it was very good.  Only change I made was that I did not add the olives.

Good, reliable formula for a basic Bloody Mary, just waiting for your own personal spin and additions, whether it's horseradish, Clamato, steak seasoning, lemon pepper, Old Bay or beef broth, any number of which we've tried.  On this occasion we merely substituted celery salt for the sea salt and threw in a couple of spears of pickled asparagus.

This worked out very nice!  I used a dash of celery salt and quite a bit more hot sauce but the taste was right on.  Thanks for posting this.

These were great. After sampling these, I'd made a pitcher, we doubled the vodka. I also served it with a slice of crisp bacon.
I got rave reviews and they looked so great.

Very nice, simple bloody mary recipe. Had to use what I had on hand, which meant regular V8 juice instead of spicy. I just added a couple extra dashes of hot sauce. Perfect cure for a hangover. Cheers!

I used 1.5 oz vodka, 1 small can spicy v8, the Worcestershire and Tabasco sauces and topped it off with reduced sodium v8. Shaken with ice cubes and strained into a highball glass filled with ice. Much less sodium and easy to assemble.

3.2.18  This is a good starting point, but doesn’t represent what I think is a really good Bloody Mary.  For the most part, it just tasted like Spicy V-8 Juice, and it definitely needed more heat for me.  I added a little horseradish, a little beef broth, more worcestershire, a healthy squeeze of lime juice, and additional Tabasco.  I have a favorite Bloody Mary recipe on this site, and although this was OK, I think I’ll just stick with that one.

I made the bloody mary mix but since I don't like vodka I used beer instead and made bloody bulls. They turned out excellent.

This is a great recipe for a classic drink. Obviously people have different takes on types of vegetable juice to use or what kind of vodka is best.

I used Zing-Zang instead of tomato juice. And used Demitris bacon rim shot (its a spiced rim salt). Super simple, Super delicious!
