This recipe didn't work for me. I was amazed that the golden syrup became white frosting after beating it, but after frosting the cake with it and putting it in the fridge for an hour, it slid off the cake and soaked into it.  Very fortunately, we had a boxed cake and frosting in the pantry that saved our lives!

This frosting tasted great and looked beautiful on my cakes! Unfortunately, it is tedious to make, and clean up is a hassle. Be careful not to spill any on yourself or your counters, as the frosting is like spackle and is hard to clean up. I would defenitly make it again, but only for "special presentation" cakes.

I was able to get the temp. of the eggs up to by heating the whites and sugar  to 140 in a double boiler prior to beating them, just make sure you're conscious of the egg temperature while making this recipe. Check out the American egg boards website for tips.
