I think this recipe needs a fair review. See taste buds on your tongue vary from person to person which means that what may taste good to some people may not taste good to others. You should think of all of these recipes on this site as base recipes recipes you can tweak so that you like it. Going forward for those of you complaining that the sauce is too sweet here is how I made my sauce: Keep the seeds in the peppers for the sauce they add heat. Cut the sugar down to 2 tbs. And there you have it it's a szechwan sauce that my taste buds enjoy. Keep it mind that doesn't mean that yours will.

I tried this on the 'spur of the moment' and didn't have any fresh pepper so I used 1 tsp of dried crushed red pepper. (Remember 1 Tbsp fresh = 1 tsp dried) Though doubtful at first I was pleasantly surprised. Wonderful!!!

I am only giving 4 stars because I tweaked this quite a bit and there aren't very specific directions. It was extremely easy and quick and my boys (ages 4 6 and 32) all loved it! I added 1T soy 2T oyster sauce and subbed some prepared dijon-style mustard for the peppers. (I had it on hand and didn't want the sauce too spicy.) Because I used frozen veggies I added between 1 and 2T cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Very happy with the results from this very basic recipe. Can't vouch for the authenticity of the taste but definitely a keeper at our house.

Simple enough to modify for ingredients you have on hand (ex. 3 tbsp red crushed chilies 1 tsp ginger powder 1 clove crushed garlic) and to change (ex. 3 tbsp of sugar) depending on your family's taste. Will definetly make again.

I am very sorry. I absolutely did not like this. Nor did my family. To me it was waaaaaay too sweet. Lacked the fire and flavor I associate with Szechwan. Just b/c my family and I did not like it doesnt mean the rest of you shouldn't try it. you may like it even tho it is really very sweet. It was like a glorified ketchup (shrugs). Sorry. If you enjoy it that is all that matters anyway!

This is excellent. Didn't have fresh ginger so I used 1 tsp. of powdered like someone else did and cut the sugar to 2 tbsp. Had 3 nice and hot dried thai peppers and broke them to let the seeds out and get lots of heat. We made a stir fry from B.E. 3 pepper stir fry and thinly sliced sirloin that I had marinating in the sauce. Excellent. Thank You for posting this recipe.

This was a nice sweet and spicy sauce to add to a mixture of veggies and chicken. Even my 4 children loved it. I used cayenne pepper (1/2 tsp.) instead of chili peppers.

Didn't taste a thing like Szechwan but it was alright and my husband liked it! I used 1 tbsp sesame oil instead of 3 tbsp olive oil and added 1 tbsp soy sauce because the flavors were too shallow.

I liked this recipe. I did find it a little too sweet and not enough spicy. Next time I will add a little less sugar and more peppers.

Great recipe! I used ground ginger powder (1tsp) and garlic powder (1tsp) and substituted dried red pepper flakes (my boyfriend has no palate for heat!). Definitely a keeper!

We used olive & sesame oil to give this more of an Asian taste. We also made the substitution of 2T garlic chili sauce instead of the red chili peppers (but still added the amount of garlic called for in the recipe ingredients). As other reviews suggested we cut the sugar by - & used brown (sugar) instead of white. Easy recipe to make & the sauce turned out well.

Very good! I took a couple liberties as well by adding soy sauce and eliminating the sugar altogether (my wife is on a diet and wouldn't eat it that way). After having it I would not want to add the sugar - it was superb as is!

I can't vouch for the authenticity of the taste (I'm not too familiar with what Szechwan is supposed to taste like) but I really liked this! I did do a couple of things differently--I used apple cider vinegar cut the sugar to 3 tbsp and used 2 tsp of dried red pepper 3 tsp of dried ginger and added 2 tbsp of soy sauce and a pinch of cayenne pepper. It was sweet and also had a bit of a kick to it at the same time. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

We have used this several times and each time are delighted w/ the outcome. We use dried red crushed peppers with good results It is a great guide to play from. Why buy bottled sauce when you can put this together so quickly? If we want it a little thicker we simply use a little corn starch. This one is a keeper!

I love this sauce! We like it hot but it's good with mild peppers too. And it's still good if you leave out the ginger for not-liking-ginger friends.

reduced the sugar by half and added a bit of soya sauce. Also used dried chilis but since they didnt make it spicy enough I just added a tablspoon of Siracha.

I'm used to soy sauce-based sauces for stir frys but this was a nice change. I used peanut oil instead of olive oil and red pepper flakes instead of the chile peppers. I'll use less sugar next time I make this.

Read previous reviews and was glad I did...scaled the sugar way back (it bears remembering that traditional ketchup is almost all high fructose corn syrup so extra sugar is not necessary). Didn't have chiles so i used a tablespoon or so of sriracha sauce and also added some wheat-free soy sauce (before the soy it tasted too ketchup-y to me). Most asian sauces are all high fructose corn syrup or made with wheat (a no no in our house) so it was nice to finally find one I could make with ingredients on hand. Very good with our veggies over rice. thanks!

We love this with the following modifications: 1. We swap out one of the T of olive oil for sesame oil. 2. We substitute rice vinegar for white vinegar. 3. We swap out one T ketchup for Sriracha hot chili sauce.

scaled this down and used it to make the hot and sour cabbage soup recipe from this site. I didn't have any fresh peppers but I did a quick soak method for some dried red chiles and it worked perfectly. A great recipe because I had all of the ingredients on hand.

Both my boyfriend and I loved this recipe! I changed things a bit to fit my tastes however. Instead of the two chili peppers I seeded on hearty Serano pepper and then added 1.5 tsp of red pepper flakes. I then added 1 tbs of soy sauce and slightly cut down the sugar. Both of us were pleasently surpised by this recipe. I am sure I will be making it again soon!

Really liked this recipe. But I also like my spices HOT. I added 1/2 tbsp of cayenne pepper and half dozen or so Tien Tsin (china chili peppers) and that did the trick for me. The heat sneaks up on you and was just right! Will make again for sure!! Thanks for the recipe!

I have tried this recipe and I really like it. I used powdered red pepper and ginger in place of the dried and fresh stuff. I must tell you this recipe sure adds a kick! Whew!!! I also added some ingredients like dried parsley and diced tomato along with some diced green peppers onions and garlic. Here's my picture. I cooked chicken beef and shrimp in the sauce over a bed of white rice and broccoli spears on the side. Hope you try this recipe it's really good!

This was tasty and very easy to make. I followed another reviewer's advice and reduced the sugar to about 2-3 tbsp. I also used cayenne pepper powder in place of chile peppers. I decided to double the batch and use brown sugar extra ginger and extra garlic. This is a great easy recipe to make to fit your tastes. Thank you!

I made this yummy sauce and it is so good I doubt we'll be going to our one Chinese restaurant in town much anymore! I used it with some veggies I had on hand after sautéing them in sesame oil a bit then added some chicken meat already cooked and ready. I used some Chinese noodles I boiled 5 minutes threw it all together and it was a HUGE hit all around. I will be making this one again and again!!

Great sauce for sauteed veggies and any meat/mushrooms. I added 2 Tbsp of soy sauce which added the perfect blend of salt to sweet as well as a heaping tbsp of corn starch so the sauce thickens as it boils. Since I didn't have dried red chilies I used a tbsp of Rooster Sauce for a nice bit of heat. Just saute your meat and veggies add some cooked rice noodles and then add this sauce at the end and boil for a couple minutes and you've got a quick healthy delicious meal!

I used this as a marinade for some chicken I had cubed. I drained and saved the sauce then I stir fried the chicken and some snow peas carrots onion bell pepper and frozen green peas. I added the sauce back in to the wok and simmered for a couple of minutes for food safety and thickened with some corn starch. I enjoyed it very much. Not as spicy as I thought it would be. I used fresno peppers.

It's good. I made a boo-boo and put white sugar instead of brown sugar. I also used cayenne and chili arbol. I think you need that much sugar to tone down the heat. Overall a tasty sauce that is easy to make.
