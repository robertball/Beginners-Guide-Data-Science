I scaled this recipe back as a trial run before making a full batch. I goofed it up though. When I made my list for the Hispanic market I wrote down cilantro but when I looked back up at the screen and saw culantro I just read it as cilantro and it never made it on the list. I was not able to find wild oregano leaves used Mexican oregano instead. I already can't wait to make this and make it the correct way. This was excellent! I loved the flavor the olives and capers added. The peppers looked similar to a habanaro so I was worried about the heat level but they were not too hot at all.
