I am rating this recipe 5 based upon ease and taste. It took me 15 minutes to prepare this! I put the ingredients in the crock pot for the day and it was ready for dinner. I did add 3 slices of pre-cooked bacon with the onions when preparing them for the soup. It gave the soup a bit of a smoky flavor. I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to the soup which gave it a very very mild touch of heat. Not being a fan of Swiss I used cheese curds for the cheese and it was great! Would definitely make again!

Awesome and Easy recipe. I got hooked on French Onion Soup while pregnant (it was my pickles and ice cream!) and never thought I would actually be able to reproduce anything even close to most restaurant versions... Well this is it! Amazing and simple, and I'm now on my third batch in 3 months and I can't wait until it's done. 

The only thing I do differently from the stated recipe. I use gruyere cheese (the traditional cheese to use) and cube and toast my bread, place it in a soup crock, top with the cheese and then stick the whole thing under the broiler until the cheese starts to get brown and bubbly... It is fantastic!

A few years ago I ran a cafeteria and made a soup very similar to this with raves. I have been searching for the recipe since I lost my cookbook in a move. I knew all my ingreds. but wanted a hard copy recipe for it and now I found a similar. Thanks so much for submitting. I am excited to try it again. I do know I used more onions, no bay leaves (but will try the leaves) and I used homemade toasted garlic croutons YUM!!!!!! Making it this week and I cant wait!

This is an easy recipe but it just doesn't have much flavor.  The bread with cheese is a must, as that is the majority of the taste.
