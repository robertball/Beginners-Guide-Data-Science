Made this recipe for a laugh but joke is on me. I found a great candied bacon recipe and maple ice cream. Next time I will finely chop my bacon because it is weird to have to chew your ice cream that much. Maybe chocolate would be a fun add next time. My husband will have a new favorite ice cream if he gets to try this because my kids might eat it all before he even comes home.

Made this Yesterday and it is awesome. My advice to all is really brown the bacon good on a non stick pan and cool it in a fridge. The sugar will harden as well as the bacon. Then finely chop and add to the mixture as directed. We added a Raspberry liqueur as well for a hit of Maple raspberry. Lots of flavor's little servings is all that's needed.

this was amazing. I ended up tripling the recipe because I have a 6qt ice cream maker. You do need to make sure the bacon is cooked crispy so it holds up in the ice cream without getting soggy. Also make sure to taste the cream base to make sure you get a good maple flavor. I ended up adding more syrup because I was using real maple syrup.

I didn't want to make the usual chocolate vanilla strawberry or peach ice cream for the annual church ice cream social so this is what I made. It was such a hit that I've been requested to make it again this year. The most difficult part was getting the bacon crispy and not greasy. I used a grated cookie cooling tray to lay the bacon on while it cooked so it would be able to drain off the grease. Worked like a charm.

The flavor was great but it was too rich. And due to the fact that there were no eggs in it it didn't have the creamy texture once it was frozen.
