My family loved this!  I had to make some substitutions because we didn't have everything.  I was out of vinegar so I used lemon juice and didn't have any chile garlic sauce so I used hot chili powder and extra garlic.  My mom found it too hot but my two year old gobbled it up and my husband and I added hot sauce to ours so be careful.  It was a great quick family dinner, Thanks

a good base recipe. I did add 2 tbsp of tomato paste to thicken up the meat mixture but minor alteration.

Quick, simple and really, really good.  I added a little worcestershire sauce and some cooking wine for a little deeper flavor, but it's the spiciness from the garlic chili sauce that makes this so good.

Ths was a very good sloppy joe. I omitted the ketchup and added a few tbsp brown sugar.  I liked the mustard and chile-garlic sauce as well. Definatly worth a try!

My family is not a hot spice eating family and we loved this recipe. It is the very first sloppy joe sauce that we have tried that did not taste as if something was missing. We put neither the garlic or the chile-garlic sauce in ours and it was perfect. Definitely a family "insta" classic and thus a keeper.

Mmmm, spicy. Sloppy Joes with a kick, so this may not be suitable for those who can't tolerate a little heat. This wasn't spicy hot by any means, but it was medium spicy.  I used ground beef and a cup of frozen fajita vegetables (onions, green red yellow and orange bell peppers) and added 1/2 tsp of onion powder since I didn't have any other onion. I diced them up. I subbed a can of roma tomato paste and two cans of water for the puree. BBQ sauce used was Sweet Baby Rays Original and chili paste in the jar but it still had the same rooster picture as the liquid sauce. I added a little salt as the beef was browning and simmered this until the sauce thickened about 25 minutes, This was very good and I would definitely make this again but it isn't quite your traditional sloppy joes. Very very good though. Thanks!

I really love this recipe & esp. as yet another "oldie but goodie" that can be easily made vs. buying a can. Per another reviewer, I added about 2 Tbsp tomato paste to thicken it before putting on bread. And Sriracha is the perfect addition!

I made this exactly as indicated and, for a sloppy joe recipe, this is a great one. The consistency was perfect and the spice was a nice change from the usual recipe.

very tasty; family really enjoyed. I always tweak as per our tastes and what I have on hand. I made following changes; left out pepper as we don't care for it, used regular chili sauce and added garlic powder, instead of tomato sauce used spaghetti sauce I nedded to use up. It was a nice blend of flavors .

I made a few changes like diced zuchinni instead of green pepper and yellow mustard instead of brown. I will add more salt next time because it definetly needs some.

I doubled this recipe. Instead of a green bell pepper, I used a large red bell pepper. I happened to be out of brown mustard, I used dijon instead. I made no other changes. I served this on kaiser rolls with shredded sharp cheddar cheese on top. My kids really loved this, which surprized me. They loved how spicy it was and they literally had their sloppy joes gone in two minutes, mess and all. Then they asked for seconds. The ones who were more lukewarm about it were my husband and I.

My new fave sloppy joe recipe!  Finally, a sloppy joe recipe worthy of adult tastes.  I made these with just a couple small tweaks, tomato sauce instead of puree and skipped the ketchup, and used ground turkey.  LOVE the addition of Sriracha sauce, how clever!  Adds a great spice and a touch of heat.  Wonderful recipe, and a do-over for sure.  Thanks for this terrific submission, Semigourmet.

Wow what a delicious meal!!! M's Sloppy Joe Sauce pushes the others to the side. The sauce remains saucy so it is more sloppy than the others but not messy. I ate these as an open faced sandwich (knife and fork) as well as on a bun and I didn't wear any of the filling, ever. The sauce is tangy, not too sweet. I made my own bbq sauce and had to use Angostura bitters instead of Worcestershire sauce for health reasons. The outcome was a flavourful, savoury with a hint of sweet, thick sauce that melts in your mouth. The key here is the garlic chili sauce. It has that pungent aroma and kick when you taste it but never too spicy and not too overpowering. It simply coheres with the other flavors. This is not the school cafetteria version, this is adult sloppy joes. Sip a cold beer with these and you'll be happy you finally grew up! Thanks Semigourmet for sharing your wonderful recipe.

Subbed dijon for brown mustard.  Pretty good, but no "wow"s.  E liked it.  K wouldn't try.  :/  :)  No one detected it being turkey.  After prodding, E said he wouldn't mind having it again  Pretty healthy so I'll keep this in mind for desperation dinners.

Excellent fresh sloppy joe sauce! I used tomato sauce instead of pureed canned tomatoes and left out the chile-garlic sauce because I didn't have any. All in all it came out great and my kids loved it!

Good starter base. I added more BBQ sauce, salt & pepper (of course), 1/2 can of tomato paste to thicken it up, a little more worcestershire and nixed the green peppers.  Turned out great!

Big hit with all generations! My hubby and I were talking about never having had a really good Sloppy Joe, and my mother had actually never had it (she never went to public school cafeterias) - so after reading the rest, we found the best. Some Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and Gulden's mustard makes this grand. We did let everyone put their own hot sauce as we all have different preferred heat levels (from nothing to Sriracha). Thanks for a new family treat, semigourmet and "M"!

This was my first attempt at homemade sloppy joes and it turned out great!  I couldn't find the chile-garlic sauce, so I used a teaspoon of minced garlic and a can of green chiles.  It was a saucy-sweetness that my husband loved.

Perfect balance and adaptability!  I generally don't care for Sloppy Joes - they're just too sweet.  This recipe lets you make them as sweet or spicy as you like, using your favorite barbecue sauce (I used Annie's Sweet and Spicy) and chili garlic (I used Lee Kum Kee in deference to my children, who aren't keen on Sriracha).    I suspect this will become a regular in our house, where there hasn't been a Sloppy Joe in 15 years!

Yummmm. I had to make it without green pepper, cause I have a picky husband, so had to add something to give it a little "kick" for myself. I chose 1/2 tsp of hot sauce, and it worked well!

Been wanting to try ground turkey since it is more nutritional than beef, and this recipe sounded great.  Had trouble browning the gr. turkey until I remembered I had purchased gr. turkey breast.  The still white gr. breast didn't look too appetizing so I added Kitchen Bouquet's Gray Mate to brown it up a bit.  Did the trick and tasted great!  Not afraid to substitute gr. turkey for beef anytime.

I loved the garlic and spiciness of this sauce,  however it was way too sour for my taste.  I added two tbsp. of brown sugar plus a dash of liquid smoke. Yummy!

A good recipe but....
I simply had to play with it to amp up the flavor and dial up the healthy:
1. Omitted the pureed tomatoes and used a can of tomato paste for texture and richness.
2. Used balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar which added a savory layer.
3 Omitted the processed ketchup and used a 1/2 TBS of brown sugar for the "sweet".
4. Added finely chopped mushrooms to the almost cooked ground turkey to "beef" up the meat and add fiber and vitamin D to my meal.
Finally, I did not add any salt.  The flavor changes enhanced this dish enough so that I did not need to add any extra sodium.  This was delicious on the leftover wheat pita pocket bread I had from a previous meal (lower calories than a bun!)

Great sloppy joe recipe! I made it as directed, only substituted red bell peppers for green and crushed tomatoes for purèed tomatoes. Much better than any canned Sloppy Joe sauce. Thanks for this!

I think this is one thing that would be better with ground beef.  Other than that, however, it was very good.  I didn't have any chile-garlic sauce so I subbed in some garlic, chili powder, and crushed red pepper and used spicy brown mustard.  I will definitely make this again!

Yum.   I made this with minor changes using what I had on hand.  So, Dijon mustard instead of brown.  Cider vinegar instead of white.  I used a can of diced petite tomatoes and pureed that with the other sauce ingredients and added one extra clove of garlic to the mix.  This was an easy, adaptable all purpose recipe.  Good stuff.

This was awesome!!!I had added the 4 peppers(green,red,orange and yellow),and only squirted some of the hot stuff as I can no longer handle hot/spicy as much any more...Then my son took over the cooking and added marble cheese all over the sloppy joes...I will be making this again and again and again...This was so yummy!!!

Way better than the canned stuff. Delicious and perfect consistency. I love that the mixture came out kinda clingy, makes for less-sloppy sloppy joes! Next time might melt some shredded cheese into it before serving.  Awesome!

This was pretty good!  It was a little on the sweet side for my taste, but that is probably because of the barbecue sauce I used.  The kick from the sriracha was perfect, though.  I'd definitely make it again, but I'll play around with it some.

I made this instead of buying the canned sauce. My family couldn't even tell the difference! I ran out of ketchup and used a couple tablespoons of brown sugar. I'll probably use a little more ground meat (all I had was 1.30 pounds) so the sauce isn't dripping on the plate. Very good recipe. I'll make this again.

I think the last time I made sloppy joes was over 30 years ago with my mom, using the canned sauce. Out of the blue I got a craving for them and tried this recipe. I loved it! I don't typically buy BBQ sauce but I bake a lot and always have molasses on hand, so I substituted 4 tablespoons of molasses, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, a teaspoon of cayenne, and a tablespoon of tomato paste in its place and it turned out fabulous! I also did a vegan version, using ground portobello mushrooms in place of ground turkey or beef.

Awesome recipe!  The only alterations I made were to double the garlic and add a lot more Sriracha (I used about a 1/4 cup!), but that was only because I like very garlicky, spicy foods... A great recipe to play with!

My husband and I loved it! Even my picky 6 year old ate it right up. I made a few mods myself. I chopped up the onion and bell pepper really small. I only used 1/4 of a really large onion and half of a large bell pepper. I used a can of tomato sauce and left out the garlic pepper sauce(due to the kiddos). Also used beef. Other than that everything else was the same. This is in my recipe book as a keeper!

It is good, but it needed sugar to bring it out. In addition,  I used tomato sauce and tomato paste.
