Hi I am the submitter of this recipe, the cilantro bunches where I shop are fairly small, hence the 3 bunches. So as far as the cilantro goes add it to your taste! Enjoy ♥

FANTASTIC!! I added some bowtie pasta and black olives per another suggestion and it was a light, but satisfingly refreshing meal!! Takes some time to dice eveything but well worth it as it is requested by friends so often. Add and delete as you wish as it really is a forgiving recipe and one that you will be so Glad you made!!

Good combination of flavors, but the lemon juice alone was too dry.  I added about 2 tablespoons of really good evoo and it was more moist and tasted better.

This is one of my favorite salads.  The roma tomatoes, avocado, feta, and cilantro all go well together.  No spices or dressings needed with this one!

Yum. I was just picking at this some more while I put away the leftovers. I used plain feta and added garlic and mexican oregano because I couldn't find the herb and garlic blend of feta. We had this with chipotle chicken tonight. Next time I just want to pile it on a fat steak. The lemon/feta/cilantro-ness is really nice. It's not the best time of year for this where I live; I ended up using hothouse tomatoes cuz the romas were wimpy - and good avocados are hard to find right now, but I found some. Thanx, Celeste - every bit as good as I *imagined.* SB:)

This recipe was very good. It's basically guacamole that isn't mashed up with a few add'l ingredients added. What makes it better than guacamole is that you don't need to dip chips in it so it's very healthy!  

The first time I made it I added the feta cheese but realized that I liked the bites w/o the cheese better so I omitted the cheese the next time.  I also didn't add the peppers because I didn't want it spicy.  I also used Gourmet Garden Cilantro Herb Blend for the cilantro.  I use that in my guacamole too. It's wonderful because it tastes great AND it's already cut and mixed and ready to put into your dish.  It provides better all around flavor because it's mixes into the dish easily and well.  That's my advertisement for GG Cilantro Herb Blend ;-)  

I would definitely recommend this recipe.  It works great as a side salad, main dish or on top of meat or fish.  It's amazing that something so healthy can taste so good. And the healthy fats in the avocado fill you up.

I borrowed this recipe for a little office competition and it won for me.  I have to say it turned out better than I thought it would. Great flavors and very fresh!  Thank you for posting it.  It's going to make its rounds around my office and beyond.

This was fantastic! Perfect for summer time. I made this to pair with salmon. And it really worked out well. This recipe lends its self to modification. For example I'm not much of a jalapeño lover so I skipped that step. The salad was still bursting with flavor. Thanks you Celeste!

This salad was absolutely delicious.  If you're not a huge fan of tomatoes, I would use less.  I used 6 and it was more than enough.  What I really love is that there is no dressing.  It isn't needed.  I will make again and again.

Great summer refreshing simple and low fat salad, since we used reduced fat feta cheese. I had to add in some garlic and dry herbs since my feta wasn't spiced. I also used red onion since I had no green onions, and that worked just fine. Love the simplicity of fresh lemon juice, no oil is needed in this salad. Went great with our grilled deli sandwiches on this site. Thanks Celeste.

I made this for a cookout with friends and it was such a hit.  I have been asked several times to make this again. I have made with and without the feta.  I like both ways, although if I have to choose, I would lean toward with the feta.  Adding the feta is what makes it so different than any other salsa!

Delicious!  I scaled this recipe way back for two of us, so the ratios weren't exact, but this is hard to mess up!  My husband said he could eat it every day.

I scaled this down to 2 servings for the 2 of us (hahahahaha) I was pretty sure I was gonna get tackled in the kitchen for what little was left over. Holy cow this is some good stuff! Celeste recommended cotija cheese for me since I do not like feta. Super good, fresh, and easy to make!!!!!

HUGE hit at the party, I didn't alter a thing but served it as an appetizer with chips and crackers. The flavor is amazing, you can taste each individual item yet it blends together so well.  I'll definitely make this again.

This was very good--even a couple of days later, which is unusual for an avocado dish. I don't like a lot of onion flavor, so I used about half the amount (I was going to do two bunches, but I chickened out), and I used two large bunches of cilantro. The flavors were great; the only thing I wasn't crazy about was the texture: Between the onions and all the cilantro, it was a little "fuzzy."

This is a good recipe for a side dish. We had it with prime rib and it goes very well with beef. I didn't use as much jalapenos as the recipe suggested and it was still spicy. The kids wouldn't eat it but my husband gobbled it up and said that he liked it as a dip. He has been asking me to make it again and again.

This was really good but I didn't care for the feta cheese in it.  I usually love feta cheese but I thought it took away from the fresh flavors of the vegetables. I will try it again without the cheese and I bet it will be wonderful.

Very tasty, my wife said it was a keeper. One suggestion: don’t stir it too much, and put in the feta last. Mine turned mushy.

I made this salad to accompany a quinoa and cilantro dish for a girlfriend's birthday dinner.  They tasted amazing together and the only change I made was purchasing a lite rasberry and pecan dressing. It meshed well and didn't over-power the great flavors of this salad.

Loved this! But I gotta say 3 bunches of cilantro?! I used a half of one bunch I bought at the store and it was more than enough. Maybe I don't understand "bunch," but I take that to mean the full bunch that's twist-tied at the store. Three of those? Really?

This "Cilantro, Avocado, Tomato, and Feta Salad" was outstanding and a new family favorite. I had to leave out the garlic-herb feta because I am dairy intolerant; however, I did add in some crushed garlic. Thank you Celeste for sharing your recipe. You totally rock!

I made for the second time today.  I followed the recipe for the ingredients but the proportions are a little different.  I make for my husband and I and I want it to be all eaten the same day.  Today I used 2 large avocados, one large beefsteak tomato, a handful of cilantro, one jumbo  jalapeno and half a bunch of green onion.  There can never be enough feta for my husband so I probably used 6 oz or so.  Fantastic salad!

My sister in law made this for me a few weeks ago. Loved it. I decided that I needed to make it for myself to help me loose weight. I only use sea salt when I cook as it is healthier for  you. I need to start using EVOO again. It's just so expensive.

I have made this and even if I have substituted finger chili for Jalapeño, Peppermint for Cilantro, and Calamansi juice for Lemon,  the outcome is still delicious and very appetizing. I have of couse reduced the quantity of calamansi to half of recommendation.

Okay. I'm reviewing this with my changes, because with the recent changes to the site, I could not figure out how to make my notes easily otherwise. I know this peeves some people, but forgive me, and maybe try this with my changes, cause it was awesome. I (as usual) sized this down for two, largely because of the avocado, which always seems to go brown, no matter how much citrus juice I use. I used red onion, diced very small, about half a cup, about half a decent sized bunch of cilantro, about 1/3 cup after it was chopped finely, about a cup of diced, seeded tomatoes, one avocado, diced, about 1/2 t. ground cumin, a dash each of cayenne and turmeric, and garlic salt in place of the regular salt. I completely spaced and forgot to add the feta (the phone rang), but we didn't miss it, so I'll probably continue to leave it out to save calories; the salad is delish without it. When I went to serve this (instead of a mayo) on quinoa black bean burgers from this site, I used some on the buns, and added about 1/2-3/4c. of frozen corn (briefly heated in the microwave) to the rest of it and served it as a side dish. It was awesome! Thanks so much for the original recipe. I'm happy to look forward to the leftovers, cause I have enough for another meal because I added the corn, tho I find myself now considering the leftovers for a late night snack, or maybe over eggs in the morning.

Great combination of flavours! Made one change and used plain feta. Great summer salad Celeste. I read your review about the cilantro and I actually only needed half a bunch because my bunch was massive! I especially like this salad recipe because it is so healthy but you don't feel like you're being cheated. Nice change to a lettuce salad. Thanks for sharing Celeste.

My always dieting family love this salad. I sometimes up the peppers as we like a little spicier. The avocado makes this almost a meal by itself and doesn't need dressing.

Nothing not to like about this salad! Tasty and colorful with a hint of spice from the jalapeños. I would have liked it a little more spicy so next time, I won't deseed the jalapeños too well. A lot of work cutting all those ingredients, but very worth it. So good!

This is one of my favorite recipes. It is so refreshing in the summer. I have also taken it to multiple dinner parties and it always gets rave reviews. Just make sure not to mix it too much so it doesn't get too mushy.

I've tried a version of this salad where I use a romaine salad base and put the avocado, tomato and onion  on top add corn subtract feta and make a lime/ olive oil dressing instead of lemon juice. big hit with all my friends and family
