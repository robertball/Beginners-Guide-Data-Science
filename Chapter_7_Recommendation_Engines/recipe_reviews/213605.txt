I was very skeptical of this... really? cornbread in 5 minutes?  but it was GREAT!  I added a little more sugar and a little more oil because i like moist cornbread.  I put it in for 3 minutes in my microwave (900 watt) and it came out perfect.  I'll definitely be making this in the future!

Decided at the last minute to make cornbread with the chili tonight so I came to allrecipes.com to find a recipe......and I found this one.  Since it was the first time making it, I didn't change anything.  The hubby said it could be sweeter.  I eat mine with butter and honey so I didn't notice.  Even the kids liked it.  I loved how easy and quick it was to make....and in the microwave.  I'd never heard of cornbread done in the microwave before.  Mine took a total of six minutes to be completely done but even at that.....it's a heck of a lot shorter than in the oven!  And great for a last minute add to dinner!  You definitely have to try this!

My husband said this is the best cornbread he's had in his life, and he's 60.  He liked it because it was moist inside, but I found it to be firm as well.  It didn't crumble to pieces when I split the slices to butter them.  The only changes were that I used 3 Tbsp sugar due to previous reviewers advice, and 1/2 tsp salt because salt enhances other flavors.  I used a 9" pie plate with a juice glass in the center to ensure against a soggy middle.  I greased the cookware, added the batter, and cooked in a 1200 watt microwave for 3 & 1/2 minutes.  I reheated it later for 30 seconds with no discernable change in quality.

I'm sorry but we didn't care for this at all.  It really did cook up in 3 minutes which was amazing!!  But the texture didn't feel right to us and it probably could have used some more sugar (we tend to enjoy sweeter cornbread).  I am glad I tried it though!

For microwave anything, this was awesome. It does not have the texture of regular cornbread (well, my kinds) - very light and almost cake-like, not too much cornmeal, touch of sweetness. There is no browning or crust to speak of. It's very delicate and doesn't hold up well to being buttered. However, I thought it tasted great. It was warm and fresh and done in 4 minutes on high (800 watt oven). I made it because I forgot about the bread until I was serving, and because I'm cool like that I know I'll gratefully be making this again. Thanks!

This was SHOCKINGLY good. I made it assuming I'd have to throw it out because I usually hate the microwave for anything but reheating leftovers, but really enjoyed it!  I did adjust it a little - I added a handful of frozen corn to the mix, and after I microwaved it I put it under the broiler on high for a few minutes to get a nice brown crust on top. What a great recipe!

This REALLY made my day! I've been having oven withdrawals since living in Japan. Granted, I can't make that crispy golden crust I love so much, but it fulfilled my cornbread craving in a snap! I can't believe how easy it was to make this.

FANTASTIC!!! I am a Brit who has lived in the States and loved corread at thanksgiving (I also used to make it just as a bread to have in the house). Love this recipe-perfect for when you want to make it, can not rate it high enough.   Did not have baking powder in the house however so used self raising flour.

I am not a big fan of microwave baked goods . . . unless of course it’s almost 100º out like today and I don’t want to run my oven, then I become a big fan.  I surprised myself by liking this recipe very much.  You can actually make this in five minutes and it’s very good.  I don’t think it’s quite as good as an oven baked cornbread and I miss the browning of the oven baking but you can’t beat this if you want to make a good cornbread in very little time.

Awesome! I was skeptical about the microwave cooking idea but it works! My entire family really enjoyed this! Although i did have to cook it for about 5-6 mins. Not sure if this is because of my microwave or what but I kept adding 30 seconds at a time until it was done. It is still faster than the oven and is ready so fast i made several loaves in a 1/2 hour. Next time I will add more sugar or stevia but overall my whole family loves it!

We found this edible and quick, but as a Southerner, it just wasn't good ole' cornbread.  It is fine if served topped with chili, soup, etc.  I used an 8x8 square pan and 3.5 minutes did the job.  A smaller pan may yield better results.

It was delicious...... My husband loved it. It was light and moist. I added more oil and sugar. Next time I might add a dash of vanilla and some sultanas. I will make this again and again. Thank you soooooo much for sharing this recipe.

I was very sure this recipe would not work out, or taste terrible.  Boy, was I wrong!  Granted, it's not as good as oven baked, but for a last minute thing...it's wonderful.  I didn't change a thing, just threw some grated cheddar on top.  Definitely a keeper!

I made a batch of beans and decided I wanted cornbread along with...and I DIDN'T want to heat up the kitchen with the oven.
This recipe came to the rescue!
It's always interesting to read other's reviews, noticing how different everyone's tastes and preferences are. 

I followed the ingred as written and it was too sweet for me, as I suspected it might be, but I wanted to give it a go and then adjust from there for future attempts.  I don't like sweet cornbread, but that's just me.
As for cooking, I wanted to use a pie plate as suggested in one review, but my glass pie plate is missing in action (I've moved a couple of times) so I used a shallow, round vintage Pyrex casserole dish and set a coffee cup in the center to eliminate the possibility of a soggy middle.
Overall, I liked this cornbread, although I like the real deal better. This is a great way to get some cornbread on the table fast, without heating up an already hot kitchen. Thanks so much for sharing.

This was pretty good cornbread! It looked and tasted beautiful, and it only took 5 minutes to make! Still, it was not quite the same as cornbread made in the oven. Not golden on the edges or top, all of it cooks evenly including the edges. It was pretty good, could be sweeter, it also has a sort of different flavor, but still tasted like cornbread. I had no problem with the texture. It was different, but not in a way that made it unappealing. I think I will make this again, especially if I am short on time. I would suggest eating it with honey.

Just made this. Taste wise is similar to Chinese "Fatt Koh" with cornmeal. For a microwaved cornbread I find it to be quite tasty.

If you want something quick to go with dinner it is great, but it is not the best cornbread.  It took longer than 3 minutes to cook in my microwave and it would probably be better with more sugar.

I like the flavor, and I really liked the ease of the microwave. The only thing was the texture of the pieces on the edge. It was spongy, but I think that was just because of the microwave. I will be making this again!

This recipe made me very, very happy!!  :c) True, it isn't quite as good as oven baked corn bread but it baked up beautifully and was delicious with my pinto beans. I'm really glad I found this recipe because my husband isn't a big fan of corn bread so I don't want to heat up the oven very often to make it just for me. But with this recipe I can make it anytime. Oh, btw, I didn't add sugar because here in the South that would make it cake. Ha! Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

As a **microwave** cornbread, I'm giving this five stars.  I followed the recipe exactly, but added canned sweet corn (because that's how I like my cornbread).  It was definitely better than the second batch that did not have any whole corn.  I also cooked it in a silicone "Bundt" pan & was very happy with the result -- cooked very evenly & easy to cut into equal pieces. Thanks for this time-saving, yummy recipe!  Update:  Added >1/2 can of corn this evening vs. a few lg. spoonfuls.  The cooking time had to be increased, but the result definitely improved.  Very moist.  YUM!

I can't comment on how authentic this is as I'm not a cornbread expert but I love this recipe as it means I can make cornbread stuffing at a moment's notice. Thank you for a great easy time-saving recipe!

For out of a microwave, it's not bad. Good flavor, but it's not quite the same as when made in an oven.

we actually didn't care for this at all. it did cook in 3 minutes but we didn't like either the taste nor the texture. to be honest it may be that we're not used to cornbread.

I decided to try this because my oven is broken and my family loves cornbread.  Wow this is an awesome recipe!  It's not quite as good as cornbread from the oven but it is still wonderful and my kids loved it!  Thanks for a super quick and easy recipe!  I'll definitely be making this cornbread again and will probably add a little more sugar to it next time. :)

My kids loved it and this recipe was super easy! My cornbread didn't raise near as even as the one in the picture but it still tasted ok. It could stand to be a little sweeter (I used 3 Tb of sugar), but that is just my taste. The texture was more cake like, but that was fine with me! My cook time ended up around 5 minutes, the middle was being stubborn.  With a little tweaking this recipe could easily be a  5 star recipe! Thank you so much for posting it!

This was really tasty, and just as easy and quick as promised. I grated a bit of orange cheddar on top to make up for the fact that it doesn't brown in the microwave.

I made cornbread by experimenting in a mug by using a box of Jiffy cornbread mix in the little blue box.  Mix according to directions.  Spray the 'over sized coffee mug' with nonstick, pour half the mixture in each mug.  Cook one mug at a time for 3 minutes.  It did rise above the mug, then it started going back down.  Of course it depends on the different microwaves, but now that I have made two of them I will do it for the entire 3 minutes because it dries out the cornbread better making it more like oven baked.  Next time I'll try adding jalapeno ;-) for more flavor.

I just had to right a review for this recipe. I'm very skeptical when it comes to individual treats made in the microwave. I've tried different kinds - brownie, mug cake, cookies, etc - and they all come out rubbery and not that good! But yesterday I was craving corn bread - random - but I didn't want to make a big dish. Just something for me to enjoy. I looked online for an 'individual corn bread recipe' and came across this one. I was 2nd guessing myself but I decided to try it out anyway! I didn't make any changes to the recipe. The only thing I did was add a little vanilla and threw in some raspberries and blackberries..put it in the microwave and 5 minutes later....it was done. And the test? It was perfect! I was completely shocked on how good it was! Thank you for posting the recipe! It's a keeper! The only thing I thought was that it was almost too fluffy---similar to a cake, so I may try it again with 1 tsp of baking powder instead of 2 and see what happens. Great recipe!

10/9/2011 In spite of not being crusty like baked cornbread, this is delicious and worth every star given the ease, quickness and taste.  The texture is a bit spongy but that's what I expect from the microwave.  I don't know why I waited to try this recipe--a must, especially in the summer! 12/13/2018 This is my son's favorite cornbread. I forgot to say I always cook it in an 8.5-9-inch glass ring (mold) dish. Perfect every time.

I tried this recipe because I moved into a place that doesn't have an oven. I've had better cornbread in my life but this recipe turned out great especially considering how easy it was. I'll definitely be making this again.

It was delicious. I added a bit of honey to sweeten it, around 2 tablespoons. That just made it over the top.

Also, I have the same set of pots you have, based on the picture.

Very fast and easy. Doesn't have the same texture as regular corn bread but a good quick substitute when in a hurry.

Whoa. I was surprised it actually turned out, especially with my tweaks. I used whole wheat flour and instead of sugar I used honey. Not bad. I wonder if it could use with a tad less baking powder, though. Seemed a little bitter.

I followed the recipe except for I added more sugar because I like sweet cornbread.  I spread my cornbread in a 8 inch glass dish sprayed with non stick spray.  I have an 1100 watt microwave and it only took 3 minutes and 45 seconds for it to be done.  It did not brown, but other than that was perfect.  Not dry at all.    I will definitely make this again.

I followed the directions exactly and it the cornbread turned out perfect. The consistency is like a dumpling. Moist and fluffy. I will make this often because cornbread is often a last minute idea.

Like some others said, I NEVER thought I would do this! I'm a southern girl, and cornbread is NOT made in the microwave. But I needed cornbread and had no time. The only changes I made were to use pork fat instead of vegetable oil, and no sugar (because real cornbread is not sweet! LOL). It was better than I expected! Put some butter on it and dunked it into a bowl of beans, and it was pretty dang good! I would do it again, it was that easy! No hot oven to deal with, no cast iron. For company I'll still do it the old fashioned way, but just for me, this will work!

This was good... for a microwave recipe. I wouldn't serve this as cornbread on its own, but it would probably be great for cornbread dressing or used as a corn spoon bread of sorts, with butter and honey. I added mine to a turkey and black bean salad, and it was good. Thanks for the idea!

I tried this recipe but used self-rising flour and cornmeal instead, added 2 tables spoons of of olive oil and one egg.  sprayed a pyrex dish with non-stick oil and microwaved for 3 minutes.  I cut into pieces to fit into a toaster oven until brown on top.  You could not tell that it wasn't baked in a full oven.

This cornbread is great for what it is! It's fast and easy to make; the recipe is even easy to memorize. It's great for summer since you don't have to use the oven.  I love things I can make in the summer without heating up the kitchen. This is perfect! It isn't the same as oven-baked cornbread, but I was very pleasantly surprised that the texture and taste is not much different from oven baked. Give this recipe a try and you will be surprised, too!

This was so easy to make and yummy.   I've made this few times now and as other reviewers have said, I needed to add more milk (3 Tbsps) for more moist bread.  Thank you for this great recipe.

I was shocked that this cornbread came out moist and delicious!
I added a teaspoon of bacon grease. That was the only change I made and it was fantastic!

I read all the reviews and added an extra tbsp on sugar and an extra 1/2 tbsp of oil. Also baked in a glass pie pan with a plastic juice glass upright in the center. Only took 2'30" in my 1,000 watt microwave. Absolutely delicious.

In all fairness, all I had was self rising corn bread mix, so this is probably better with cornmeal. I made the needed adjustments to account for extra ingredients. The texture was definitely not as good as oven baked, but in a pinch it does the job!

Ridiculously easy, and very tasty for a quick fix with chili.  I did pop it under the broiler for a couple minutes after it was done to brown up the top.  It took about 3.5 minutes in my microwave.

I made it exactly as written and it wasn't bad. It was a little dry. It does the trick if you want corn bread but don't have an over or time to bake.

I was looking for a microwave bread recipe not expecting anything so I was doubly pleased to find this one because my family loves cornbread.  I made it with white whole wheat flour (it was all I had) and skipped the egg because of allergies, then doubled the recipe.  It turned out surprisingly well albeit a little dry but I have a very powerful microwave so I should have cut the time down.  If you like a sweeter cornbread then add more sugar but this is a great basic, very quick recipe.

Wow, this surpassed my expectations, too.  I made it gluten free by using GF all purposse flour but still made it exactly to recipe. In my smaller micro, it took 4 minutes.  It was SO easy.  Sliced the pieces in half, buttered them, and enjoying them with a nice homemade soup.  A perfect winter meal.

Didn't really care for this at all. Yes it cooked up nicely like corn bread and tasted like cornbread...but it had a funny aftertaste. I don't think I will be making it again.

So so easy and perfect for the summertime when you don't want to heat up the house by using your oven. As other reviews shared, the cornbread won't brown on top, but the taste and texture is great. Family loved it!

Keeper!!  We are in the middle of a kitchen remodel, so I have no oven.  This is a great recipe.  I doubled it and mixed and cooked it in my 8 cup Pyrex measuring glass.  I cooked for about 7 min.  I inverted on a paper plate and it was perfect.  Came right out of the pyrex, no greasing required and sliced up nice.  Tastes like cornbread; no weird flavors.  Just no browning like in an oven.

Exactly what I needed to top some leftover sloppy joes and veggies and turn it into corn pone pie. I heated the sloppy veggies first, then scooped dollops of cornbread on top. It needed a bit extra time in the microwave. I guess due to the steam from below.  It's a hit.

Surprisingly good and amazingly quick and easy to make. It looked a little too wet after 3 minutes in my 900 W microwave, so I left it in for 4 minutes total... a mistake I won’t make again... It would have been even better if it hadn’t been so dry

I made it for breakfast this morning. I followed the recipe exactly, and cooked it for 3 minutes in a 900 W microwave oven. I used a 23 x 10.5 x 6.5 cm silicone loaf pan which I had sprayed with nonstick spray, just in case. (The length and width measurements are inside measurements.) The batter rose a bit unevenly during the cooking process but the texture and taste of the bread are great. Super easy and so quick. Hard to believe that it was made in a microwave oven. If you want it crispy, you can always toast the slices. I'll be making this recipe regularly from now on. It's definitely a keeper.

This was is so good! I'm vegan, so I used a flax egg, vanilla almond milk and coconut oil as substitutes. I also only had cornmeal on hand, so I did 1 cup of that (I also snuck a little maple syrup into the mix and then microwaved for 5 minutes). 
To me, it tasted just like cornbread from the oven, just fluffier, which is more than fine by me

Fast, good, easy, and didn't heat my whole house up, which is nice because it's 90 something degrees outside today :D 

The sweetness is spot on in my opinion, and it yielded a slightly moist cornbread that went well with butter and was pretty good pan toasted in butter as well (so much for keeping my house cool) 
I just shared it on Facebook, which is unusual for me, because I think it's that good!

side note, it took closer to 4 minutes in the microwave for me, but I've got a fairly small/cheap microwave.

After reading the reviews, I used 3 tbsp of sugar and 3 tbsp of oil. I put it i a glass pie plate with a drinking glass in the middle to avoid a soggy center and cooked it on high for 3 1/2 minutes.   Delish!

Made this doubled (as I needed a normal recipe amount and this seems like a 1/2  size recipe), added extra sugar and salt.... cooked in a 9 inch square  glass baking pan.  It took 10 min. in my very old lower wattage microwave, for the doubled batch.  Nice consistency,  good flavor.... my dead oven problem was evaded.  Supper saved.  After all, what's a good pot of pinto beans without cornbread?

This is an awesome, quick recipe for cornbread, especially if you're going to serve it with stew or beans and don't mind the pale finished product from the microwave. You can place it under a pre-heated broiler if you want a "browned" look. The texture was just fine.

Too hot for the oven and I tried this as we like cornbread with our BBQ ribs. I made this in a loaf pan. I knew it would not  brown on top but amazingly good and will make this again as long as it is hot. I toasted the sliced left overs on a hot skillet, fantastic!

I've made this several times, and am experimenting with some cumin in it.  I also make it with raw sugar, as I prefer the flavor.  Yes, it's a tad spongy, but that's a side effect of microwaving it.  One thing: you need to use a non-stick spray on the pan if you want it to come out easily, even with glass.  Still, I'd recommend it to anybody who needs to make it quickly.

Just made this as a test. I used almond milk because my wife requires lactose free food and added 2 teaspoons of carob powder to make it chocolate like . Cook time 4mins, came out really good, great recipe.

Tasted great, cooks quickly, great last minute addition to any meal ... only drawback is that it doesn't brown at all in the microwave, but when you pour chili or ham & beans over it, whose going to notice?

My husband said this was the best cornbread he has ever had! He is from Louisiana & has eaten a lot of cornbread. The moistness was #1 reason. I used gluten free flour and  did add small amount of green onions, pickled jalapeños and shredded cheddar/jack cheese in mix (sorry I don't measure)  plus a little cheese on top. I used vanilla almond milk and skipped the sugar. I have high powered microwave and it only took 3 minutes to cook. It was perfect with the vegetarian chili.

This recipe is excellent.  Obviously it will be a keeper in a last minutes soup accompaniment recipe collection.  The texture i lighter than what I am used too.  But, for a five minutes recipe - this is a great one!  Definitely will make it again.

Pretty good. Light and fluffy. I added just a bit more sugar and cheated by putting it under the broiler for a bit to brown the top.  Not as good as cooked in oven but - pretty good.

First, I easily veganized this recipe by using soy milk and a chia seed egg. I also added some canned corn because I like corn in my cornbread, and I added a half tablespoon more of sugar because I like mine on the sweeter side. Instead of vegetable oil, I used earth balance "butter". I sprinkled a bit more sugar over the top before I microwaved it. My cornbread was ready in 4 minutes, and I ate it with chili or with apricot jam. I didn't mind the texture, and it tasted good to me. It's perfect when you're pressed for time.

Disappointing. Not enough "corny" flavor, way too light & cakey. Cut & crumb is nice. Looking for a "mug" cake, but when I saw how much batter there was when following ingredients exactly, I put it into a larger, soup/salad bowl (20 oz. )- it easily could've filled TWO mugs. Good thing, because it filled to the rim with a high, rounded top. This did NOT satisfy my desire for a good ole cornbread- kinda blah.  I think I  might  it again because it IS quick, but with considerable tweaking. More cornmeal, less flour, more liquid, less sugar. Timing was right on (3 min) for 1200 watt microwave. ~ Marina

a little time-saving suggestion for you: move your table closer to your microwave. all of my steps to get it on the table only took like 30 seconds and i move like molasses. instead of having a 'ready in' time of 10 minutes, mine is only 5 minutes and 30 seconds.

It's not really fair to wing it on a recipe and then write a review, but here goes.  I really wanted something sweet and chewy, so I tried the applesauce trick- substituted applesauce for oil. Made 1/2 batch using egg beaters instead of eggs and applesauce instead of oil. Microwaved for 2 minutes in 1200 oven.  not really cornbread, more like a dry pudding,but with some homemade jam it really hit the spot!

Awesome - can't even believe that it's so easy and quick to make yummy cornbread like this- you don't even have to grease the pan- it just comes right out- incredible! I will probably be making this every week!!
