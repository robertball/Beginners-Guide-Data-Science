Very fast and easy way to make potato soup without peeling and chopping and unlike the previous reviewer, mine was so thick I had to add milk to it before I served it.  I added crumbled bacon, shredded cheddar and green onions as a garnish before serving.

The idea is great, although I thought the chowder was bland.  We had to add salt to it in order to eat it.  And the hash brown potatoes just went mushy.  When I try this again, I plan to use chicken broth instead of the vegetable, and add bacon or ham cubes for interest, and use tater tots instead of the hash browns.  And I probably won't cook it as long; I think that contributed to the mushiness. And maybe more whole kernel corn.  I didn't think there was nearly enough corn in it.

This soup had a great flavor. It was not thick like a chowder should be though. I added 1 cup of instant potato flakes to thicken it up. My family enjoyed this.

I used fresh Yukon golds (diced) and homemade chicken broth (yay, Instapot) because of what I had on hand, and omitted the celery based on my familyâ€™s preference. Whole family, even those who are not dairy fans or soup fans, enjoyed it. No leftovers and lots of compliments. A good comfort food to add to the rotation (especially during the 2019 polar vortex winter!).

I used a whole onion and 2 potatoes instead of hash browns.   I too found it really bland and added salt and bacon to it.

Soup was pretty good.... I wish I chopped the onion finer and used less cause the onion was a little over powering. I added a little cayenne pepper to give it a little spice. Topped it off with chives, soft cream and bacon!
