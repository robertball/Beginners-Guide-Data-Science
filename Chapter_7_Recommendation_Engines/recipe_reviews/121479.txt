I too changed it up a bit....
Changed servings to 10 to accomodate a 9x13 baking dish. I melted 2tbs of butter in pan low-med heat.  Added milk, 4c cheese and pepper. After melted, folded in sour cream.  Transferred elbows back to original pot.  Poured cheese sauce on elbows.  Added 1/2 c cheese.  Put mixture in glass baking dish. Sprinkle crackers over top. Add remaining 1/2 c cheese over crackers and bake at 325 for 25min. Used low-fat options where I could and came out awesome!! Will add crushed crackers throughout next time!

This was just ok. I left out the onion because, well, I forgot. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I guess I just don't really like the texture of baked macaroni... the flavor was decent though.

Good start. I added a little fresh minced garlic with my onions and one tbsp. dijon mustard and a little Frank's Hot Sauce and fresh ground pepper. I did use leftover elbow macaroni that I had leftover from the previous night's dinner, which cut baking time in half.

I used mild cheddar cheese(not even grated) broke it up into pieces and melted it with the sour cream and milk in microwave. Didn't really measure anything. Poured over cooked macaroni, and folded in the chopped onion b4 placing in bakng dish. I also sprinkled to top with cracker crumbs. Didn't use the paprika cuz I forgot :S. My kids loved it! I was surprised how easy that was! Even my adult brother said it was delish the next day! The onions really give it a nice flavor.

I changed this a little. I made the cheese sauce in a pan at low heat and then mixed in the pasta and baked. Sprinkling cheese on top for the last 10 min or so. It was great! I also added some chili paste for an added kick.

I was looking for an economical homemade mac n cheese for my kids and I for lunch.  I've tried this recipe twice now, and don't care for it.  The first time, I tried heating the sauce in the microwave as another reviewer suggested.  The second time, I followed the recipe exactly.  Both times the texture and consistency lacked creaminess.  It was almost gritty.  Even my kids turned up their noses at this.  I will not be trying this recipe again.

This was so surprisingly good!!  I added ground powdered mustard, and the overall flavor was so rich and delightful!  Mine only baked for about 18 minutes, and so my onions were still a little crunchy, but I like onions so I didn't mind:)  I love this as a change from the butter-flour-milk kind of homemade mac n cheese.

I love this macaroni and cheese.  It is similar to what my parents made me when I was growing up, although this is much easier to make.  
I didn't use paprika but did put in some black pepper and I topped with Ritz cracker crumbs before baking.  It was delicious!!!

This was a very easy recipe, but the result was not as smooth as I expected.  This recipe did not make a creamy macaroni & cheese.

I am new to cooking, and am looking for some basic recipes to begin with.  With this one, I used maybe 1 1/2 cups macaroni, about a 1/2 cup of sour cream, milk as recipe called, 3 chopped green onions, 1/3 cup mozzarella cheese and 1/3 cup romano cheese, about a 1/4 teaspoon minced garlic, topped with cheddar, baked uncovered about 10, then covered about 10, but that's because I forgot the cover..  My husband LOVED it.  Ate about 1/2 the entire dish.  Me and the pup finished it off.  I could have eaten it by myself, but am trying to cut back some.  I don't know if it was the combination of cheeses or the extra SC I used, but I did find this creamy, and did have the "sour" that folks said, but the green onions seemed to compliment it wonderfully!

I am giving this 5 stars becuase it's so easy to make and tasted pretty good too. I used sour cream with chives so I omitted the onion. I did top with more cheese and baked uncovered for 5-10 minutes. Not gourmet mac but easy mac!

I melted 
the cheese(chunked) in a casserole in the microwave. then I added the sour cream and onion. Tossed in the mac and baked as directed.  
I live alone so I had leftovers and had trouble saving them for another day.

My first time making homemade mac n cheese and this turned out to be the greatest tasting recipe.  I like this one because it doesn't call for processed cheese (yuk).  I took some of the other advice, I used different cheeses and put crushed ritz crackers (which my 3yr old loved crushing) on top before baking.  This is a keeper....

For a recipe that is so easy and only uses a few ingredients this turned out wonderfully, which is why I am giving 5 stars. I would definitely make it again for a great Mac n' Cheese that is very inexpensive and is super easy!

Tasty and creamy. I couldn't taste the chedder much, but it was nonetheless a delicious dish. I added green peas, extra onion, and ham, which made it heartier and added beautiful color. The perfect dish to bring to a potluck or cook for a special someone! Be warned though: if you increase the recipe and use a larger pan, know that the prep time will take longer because that much pasta takes a while to boil. Also beware of using too large a pan, because the pasta is thin and dries. Overall though, delicious.

I tweaked this recipe  and doubled it. I used half heavy whipping cream and half milk. I heated the cheese sauce on low heat before pouring it over macaroni! I also melted butter mixed
with bread crumbs and sprinkled on top! DELICOUS! I didnt bake for thirty minutes more like 20.

I was a little bit disappointed.  Although very easy to make, the sauce wasn't creamy and was rather bland.  I don't think I would make this again :(

Just o.k. to me.  Rich, almost too rich.  I think I prefer a recipe where you make a cheese sauce, then add to the pasta and bake.  I expected a smoother result.

This was easy, but not creamy.  It was also too sour for my taste. Next time I'll try using processed cheese and omit the sour cream. I love the quick mix, though.

I made a bechemel sauce with butter flour and milk then stirred in the sour cream and cheese. Next time I will use less sour cream (it overpowered the cheddar) and sharp cheddar (I used a mixture of sharp and mild). Loved the serving size, most of the recipes made a huge portion. Very good basic recipe.

I doubled it for 4 and added crushed crackers, shredded cheese, and melted butter on top.

As someone who grew up with custardy mac'n'cheese, I found this to be a little odd. It falls apart when you fork it up.  The flavor was fine but the texture was a little weird for me. S.O. loved it, though.

I doubled this recipe and used medium cheddar instead of sharp because that's what I had on hand.  I sauted the onion with 2 TBS. of minced garlic in 2 TBS. of butter and then added the milk and cheese.  When the cheese was melted, I mixed in the sour cream.  Then I mixed it together with the macaroni and baked it.  It turned out pretty well!

This came out really creamy for me! This is really good! Probably one of my favorites! Instead of 1/3 cup of sour cream, I added a cup because I had extra that I needed to use up. I added probably another 1/4 cup of Colby cheese to the mixture and topped it with slices of Colby Cheese. I really like it! :O) (I also added some diced jalepenos, just cause I like spicy foods). Will have this again! :)
