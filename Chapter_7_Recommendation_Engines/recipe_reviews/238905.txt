Wow factor here, these were the hit of the pot-luck!  So pretty on the platter.  I alternated red and yellow cherry tomatoes, and used pepper bacon.  What is it about cute food on a stick?  Folks gobbled them up!  Thanks for sharing your cute appy ideas, Lindsay, they are winners.

All I had in my frig was butter lettuce, so I tore off the leaves and put the tomatoes and crumbled cheese inside them and skewered them to make little sealed pockets. Then I drizzled the dressing over all of the pockets. This is a great way to put salad on a buffet line so guests can serve themselves easily.

What a terrific idea this is! Thank you, Lindsey!

I liked that this recipe looked clever and sophisticated but the reality was quite different. First of all, skewering the lettuce in a small wedge was impossible, as once you cut it, it falls apart. Secondly, while it looks like a fun appetizer you can bring to a party, by the time to get to the party it’s wilted and rather sad. Finally, while it looks like a “finger food” it’s quite messy so, it is definitely not.

Changed to dressing to ranch, but otherwise fantastic.  What a great presentation, and not too unhealthy.

YUMMY!  These are a bit messy to eat, so the second time we did them, we made them as lettuce "cups", using leafy green lettuce instead.  I KNOW, not authentic wedge, but still delicious.  Will make these a regular for parties!

I made these for a happy hour party and they looked pretty on a  platter, and was a big hit. Definitely thick bacon and we baked ours.

These are fantastic! Everyone love them. I followed the advice of one review and did not cook the bacon until it was crispy, it was easy to spear. I also used ranch dressing. I will make this again and again!

Was sometimes to try this recipe.i am huge fan of wedge salads and was having a luncheon and thought the salad on a stick was fun,appealing and great tasting. Like another reviewer, when it was time to skewer, my bacon was too crisp. I had no problem with the lettuce wedges, but was concerned about my guests actually being able to comfortably eat them on a stick. I ended up just making wedge salads on a
