Made these for the Derby and friends begged me for them again yesterday. I actually planted mint in a pot, very easy to grow and a lovely garnish. Remember, the better the bourbon the better the cocktail!  Thanks for sharing.

I made this and my husband fell in with it. Its a very refreshing drink especially on a hot humid summer day. We'll definitely make this again. I did use Crystal light lemonade mix to cut back on the sugar. Tasted perfect! Thanks for sharing!

We had friends over last night.  He makes his own version of mint juleps however, he couldn't stop raving about how good this recipe was.  His wife is sensitive to whiskey so I replaced the bourbon with clear rum and it was just as tasty.  Excellent recipe.  Thanks for sharing!!
