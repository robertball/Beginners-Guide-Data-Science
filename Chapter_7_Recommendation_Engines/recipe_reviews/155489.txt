This was a great wa to use up all those Thanksgiving leftovers.  Instead of plain green beans I used the rest of a green bean casserole we had the night before.  This gave it al lot of flavor.  Also, topped with shredded cheese. YUM!

I did this (pretty much) last year, and am looking forward to doing it again this afternoon. My recipe is a little different, and may help the reviewer that mentioned she'd have liked the potatoes to be a little crustier.  I put the stuffing in the bottom for the crust, and then did the potatoes on top (sort of like a Shepherd's Pie).  Also, all of our green beans always get eaten (I use the Green Beans and Cherry Tomatoes recipe here), so I usually throw in a bag of frozen mixed veggies.  It's all a great combo!

This recipe was very good.  I didn't have any leftover stuffing, but decided I'd just make a box of it while it was cooking.  I assembled everything else only to discover I didn't have any stuffing!  So instead of the stuffing I tore up some leftover rolls & put them on top.  I melted some butter, added turkey rub seasoning to the butter, then brushed it on top of the bread.  During the last few minutes of baking, I added some french fried onions (to add some extra flavor since I didn't have the stuffing).  I was hoping I'd get a little more solid of a "crust" with the potatoes, but it was still soft (even though the top edges were getting brown).  Nice way to use up the Thanksgiving leftovers & it had lots of flavor.

I used a deep dish glass pie plate and I had to double the ingedients. I used our leftover cornbread dressing for the crust and baked at 375 for 10 mins while I reheated the other sides. I added cubed turkey & ham, some leftover wild rice/sausage/pecan dressing (personal recipe), & a few tbsp of gravy. Then I put my 'oranged' cranberry sauce on one half, since I wasn't sure if hubby wanted it or not (he did!), then the mashed potatoes and melted butter. To save time, I put the completed casserole in a pie plate in the microwave for 4 mins until it was hot, then only baked for 15 mins until it was golden and bubbly. (the same principle of baking a potato; goes faster if you microwave it first.) This is a keeper! The kids, 10 and 12, plus me & hubby only left about 2 big slices for leftovers, and they're asking for more!

I made this tonight in individual oven safe dishes.  The only thing I added was a layer of sweet potatoes.  I piled the potatoes in a high mound and baked for about 20 - 25 minutes.  Perfect!

This was delicious!!!  We followed other reviewers' suggestions to flip the mashed potatoes and the stuffing -- we put the mashed potatoes on top and the stuffing on the bottom, which formed a delicious crust! -- and then we skipped the green beans (didn't have any), and added the rest: pieces of turkey and gravy. We also added our cranberry sauce (as per another reviewer's suggestion), and mashed sweet potatoes. It was fantastic!!! We will definitely be making this again. It was the best use of leftovers I've ever had, and also one of the best dishes I've eaten, period. :)

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. We had no green beans or green bean casserole left over. Instead I used leftover roasted vegetables and also leftover sliced cooked carrots. I followed other suggestions and reversed the potatoes and stuffing positions. I also put cranberry sauce on half the pie, as suggested. I liked the cranberry but my husband did not. Finally I sprinkled some shredded cheddar cheese on top. Delicious way to serve leftovers without a lot of different dishes.

Excellent! Flipped mashed potatoes and stuffing, as others suggested. Used frozen mixed veggies instead of green beans, because that's what we had on hand. Would love to try it with green bean casserole or other veggies. Loved by all four of us--hubby, 2 yr old, 1 yr old, and me. Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good!  I made a cranberry mayo and tossed the turkey cubes in it.  I also made a stuffing crust and topped it with mashed potatoes as many others suggested (prebaking the "crust" to crisp it up).  While enjoying it, I realized I should have thrown some french fried onions on top....

I have been  making this for the past two years and look forward to eating it as much as thanksgiving dinner.  My modification: I reverse the stuffing and mashed potatoes to make it like a shephards pie....the stuffing makes a more solid crust..and try mixing some leftover cheeseball into the mashed potatoes...delish!

Aw Leftovers are leftovers no matter how you look at it.  But this recipe helps get rid of them a little bit quicker.

I used this recipe as a loose guideline. I didn't have stuffing, so I used scalloped corn as a topping, and didn't have leftover veggies, so I used about a cup of frozen mixed vegetables. This was delicious and a great way to use up leftovers.

Yummy but wish potato 'crust' was 'crustier'. If that makes any sense. I recommend pre-baking the potatoes for a few minutes to get a crisper more pie like crust. Also the mashed potatoes will be easier to spread in a crust if they are slightly warm. One can achieve this by microwaving the potatoes first, just so they're warm. I didn't pay much attention to the measurements, I just put enough potatoes to make a crust, then a nice layer of leftover green bean casserole, then enough cut up turkey to cover that etc. It's possible that my crust wasn't crispy due to the extra moisture from the green bean casserole. Something to keep in mind...... As as cook I am my own worst critic. My husband who rarely doesn't like anything I make has declared this 'delicious'. So there you go!

I tried this last night with Thanksgiving leftovers. I got raves. I followed one reviewers advice and switched the potatoes and the stuffing. I also added some leftover corn casserole. It worked well. This will be a stand by for next Thanksgivings leftovers also. Nice way to use them up.

Made this tonight - put stuffing on the bottom per other reviewers.  Added green beans (not the casserole type) for the veg, a light layer of cheese on top.  Baked up beautifully and served up well, we ate the whole thing but it felt like it was lacking "something".  Tasted like leftovers, plain and simple.  Not sure it's worth the work to assemble!

Made it exactly as directed, only doubling all ingredients. My husband and I were surprised at how good this tasted, being made from all Thanksgiving leftovers mixed together. Great way to use up leftovers so they don't go to waste! I will be using this again next year for sure! :)

Great!  My 12 year old wanted us to not eat anymore, so that he could have it for lunch the next day.  I reversed it also, with the stuffing on the bottom- to make more of a crust idea, and added cheese to the top. Yummy!!

Excellent. This is a keeper for me! I used my own stuffing, not boxed. That was the only change I made. I had made plenty of home-made stuffing and needed to use it up. It serves 4 as listed. I served it with some hot rolls and cranberry sauce on the side. Wonderful!

I doubled the recipe in a 13x9 pan, and everyone liked it. I used stuffing, turkey, green bean casserole, some frozen mixed vegetables, the leftover gravy, mashed potatoes & grated cheese. I also added a chopped cooked onion with the vegies. Instead of leaving the turkey's cavity empty, we put a couple whole onions and an apple inside for moistness and flavor. One of those onions made a great addition to this dish. We also liked the name of the recipe.

I really liked this but the rest of the family, not so much.  They didn't like the green beans.  They would have preferred if the green beans had been served on the side.  Easy enough to do next time.  I did switch the dressing and the mashed potatoes as suggested by others.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a tasty way to get rid of all the leftovers before the food spoiled.  I used my leftover greenbean casserole instead of just plain greenbeans.  Plus I didnt have any potatoes or leftover mashed potatoes.  So I used instant potatoes which was just as tasty!
