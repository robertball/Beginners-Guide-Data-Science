This was a very simple and quick dish to prepare.  Coming from Singapore, this dish definately brought back a few memories.  For those who are interested in trying something new, this is a pretty quick and easy "authentic" tasting Singaporean Chinese dish.!!!!

I ended up having to add more water than the recipe called for because the rice was still hard when my rice cooker stopped.  Also, since there was more water added, the dish was rather bland, so I served it with some Maggi Seasoning on the side.  It turned out all right, but since I had to modify the recipe in order for it to turn out okay, I'm giving it only 3 stars.
