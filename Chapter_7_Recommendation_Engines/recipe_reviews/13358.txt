I'm rating this, based on the recipe as it's written.  It's awful, lol.  However, it is 100% salvagable.  Definately substitute the water with beef broth (I did two cans of vegetable broth and two beef)  I added an additional cup of merlot, 3 bay leaves, and some thyme.  Rather than simmer in the oven, I transfered the meat to the crockpot after had browned it.  Also, I added some fresh minced garlic to the meat while is was browing, and it was great.  By cooking in the crockpot, I found that by the time I added the potatoes and let them cook for a good hour or so, the starch from them thickened up the stew just right.  I added salt and pepper to taste, and a little more garlic the last 30 minutes or so, and it was really good.  But this definately needed some doctoring up!

The best beef stew we've ever had!  I've made many stews, so I know what we like and dislike in it.  I omitted the worchestire sauce because it just overpowers the other flavors and we really don't care for it.  I used 1/2 water & 1/2 beef broth.  I also seasoned the meat/flour with blk pepper, seasoning salt, garlic powder, paprika, and onion powder then saved the leftover flour to thicken the stew with. After browning the meat, I added enough water and scraped up the bits on the bottom of the pan for added flavor, then added all the broth & water, onions and celery. For added flavor, I added thyme, rosemary, extra bay leaf and extra seasonings.  I suggest when you cut up the beef, potatoes and carrots, try to make them all the same sizes and not so big.  At the last hr, added the veggies, corn & peas and last minute, added the leftover seasoned flour (which was mixed w/h20 so it doesn't get lumpy when added to the hot stew).  Served this with french bread and everyone loved it!  This will now be our staple beef stew.  Thanks

I've been making this recipe for several years, and it is great as is, but I always tweak recipes because my hubby and I love dishes with lots of flavor.  I add cumin, garlic powder, fresh ground pepper, and paprika to the flour before dredging the beef.  Instead of shortening, I use butter and olive oil.  I also substitute 2 beef bouillion cubes for the salt and add 1/4 C ketchup, 1 tsp oregano, and an extra bay leaf.  This is a perfect fall or winter meal with homemade bread...definitely one of my favorite comfort foods!  This can easily be made in the crockpot so it can be ready when you come home from work.  Just brown the beef before adding to the crockpot, add all the rest of the ingredients, and cook on low for 6 hours. Before serving, add the 1/4 C flour paste and heat on high for 15 min to thicken.

I started making this back several years ago and usually make it at least once a month. It is a great base for a stew but it definitely needs alot of flavor added to it. For added flavor and also for thickening purposes....try it this way and I am sure you will not be dissapointed. When the meet is browned and you have added all the basic things such as your water...onions..garlic, etc....let it simmer for about 15 minutes and then try adding.....a few tablespoons each of ketchup...barbecue sauce...A-1 sauce...and chili sauce. Also add some extra worstershire sauce and a tablespoon or so of sugar. I know...it may sound a little strange but believe me...you will love the results! When all that is added...let simmer for about 45 minutes and then add your vegetables and simmer until tender. Do it just this way and I guarantee you that will continue to from now on. The flavors are amazing and it makes this a very satisfying meal.

This was great...my husband loved it, but I did use some variations. First, I dredged the stew meat in flour, season salt pepper and paprika, then I browed it in a pan with olive oil and minced garlic. I added 4 cups of water but also added "Better than Base" which is basically a beef boullion. Everything else is pretty much the same with the exception of adding corn, I substituted celery. It was great, but next time I'm not adding worcestershire sauce, and also watch how long you cook the meat, I cooked it a little too long and it started to fall apart.

This stew is indeed great! It doesnt need the long cooking time to get the desired flavour as well. All it took was an hour and a half. I didnt use shortening. replaced it with normal oil. My boyfriend loves it. I made extra and he brought it to work today and his co-workers tried it and they all think that it is great. Somehow, it tasted better when you leave it over night. My suggestion is cook it the day before you want to eat it and store it in the fridge overnight. You will be pleasantly surprised!

This is THE BEST beef stew recipe. It's a staple at our house- I make it at least two or three times a month!
I did change a few things (mostly on advice from other reviewers). I add two cans of diced tomatoes and two cans of beef broth instead of the water, skip the corn and paprika, and double the worcestershire sauce. I also add 1 tsp of parsley and 1/8 tsp of red pepper for a little kick.
Sometimes I add a can of garbanzo beans and a can of italian green beans, too. Gives it lots of flavor and texture. Yum! And perfect for this cold weather!

Thank you so much! I have tried several recipes in an attempt to obtain the same great stew a friend of mine had made. This was excellent! My husband was very impressed. I followed the recipe with the following changes: 2 lbs meat, 6 cups water, 6 beef bouilon cubes, used vegetable oil instead of shortening, no salt, no bay leaf, no corn, added 1 stalk celery & 1 teas rosemary. I mixed 6 tbls cornstarch with 6 tbls water & added it to stew & got the perfect consistency of "old fashioned stew". I made this last night & had to have some of the leftovers for breakfast this a.m. & I usually don't eat any breakfast. Thanks again!

Awesome Stew Joanne!  This was oh-so-good!  I changed the recipe a little, by omitting the corn and adding 2 chopped celery stalks.  Also, instead of adding 4 cups water, I added 6 cups water seasoned with 4 beef bouillon cubes.  This made a wonderfully seasoned stew!  I will DEFINITELY be making this one again and again.

WOW...this was really good. This is the first time I made a Beef Stew and I was very nervous about making it. I followed the recipe however instead of water i used 6 cups of beef broth instead and added some oregano and basil for the spices. I also used green onions. I boiled the potatoes before i added to the pot. This took off 30 minutes of the cook time. My husband could not stop raving about how good the stew tasted.

Great started recipe! I made a few tweaks though, but kept the meat and veggie ratio the same pretty much. I added a few tsp of tomato paste to the onions and browned beef, I didn't have paprika, so I added cayenne and more pepper. I also added a couple chicken bullion packets and some canned corn and frozen peas. I added the potatoes earlier like another reader suggested and it was the perfect consistency! Thanks!

This is an excellent stew recipe, pretty much as is. I did add some beef base to the water since I didn't have any broth, and using water for anything like this is not what I would normally do. I have been making stew for 40 years but decided to see if there was a better way than mine. This is very similar to my own and now I know why. Oh, one more addition at the end - a nit of "Kitchen Bouquet" to add a bit more richness and deepen the color of the gravy. Make dumplings for the top and it is heaven. If you don't like the dumplings, serve it over biscuits. YUMMMM

This is a good basic recipe to build on and much like a recipe I have been making for years.  I use two pounds of stew meat and an extra clove of garlic. I find that the flour I dredge with is sufficient for thickening the gravy.  I brown my meat with the paprika, remove and scrape the "bloom" up from the bottom of the pan, add a tablespoon of butter and a large onion, garlic and some celery (about a cup, diced) and cook till translucent, return the meat to the pan and add the rest of the ingredients. I also use 2 cups of water, 2 cups beef broth and a 1/2 cup of white wine (red will make the potatos pink!). I always use the same dutch oven to brown and bake. Slow oven for a couple of hours or three, this dish is very forgiving of my schedule. I think stew is the most versatile, inexact recipe anyone ever dreamed up and I doubt I have ever made it exactly the same way twice.  I only mentioned the things that I do a bit differently, I did use the rest of the ingredients that the contributor used.

Excellent Beef Stew.  I made it exactly as written here and it was very good.  My husband ate until he was sick...Ha.  I will definitely make this again.  Pay no attention to the snide review that says this recipe is awful as written.  It's just their opinion and nothing else.  This recipe is a keeper.  Besides, everyone has their own way of doing things in the kitchen...no need to be mean.

I would really suggest adding a small can of tomato paste!  It's a great secret ingredient and really adds a fantastic subtle flavor.

This is a great recipe.  Instead of adding beef bullion or beef broth I just added about 3/4 pound more beef since the first time I made the recipe there didn't seem to be enough beef in it.  I also added an additional tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce the second time around and that seemed to flavor up the recipe a bit.  Also, I added A LOT more vegetables than the recipe indicated, with the addition of PEAS!  The peas added a kind of sweet tone to the stew.  Another thing I did on the 3rd making was brown the beef until it was dark brown which deepened the overall color of the stew.  What should be noted:  Do not cook this recipe in a slow-cooker unless you have 7 hours wait time to tender up the beef.  This recipe works best stove-top.

Great BASIC recipe that needs a lot of pepping up to be excellent. I added a can of chopped tomatoes, chili powder, tomato paste, a splash of red wine, and changed the water to beef stock. I also added more garlic and Worcester sauce, some dried Mediterranean spices, and 3 stalks of celery. Once I did all that, it was delicious. This is a good basic recipe that can be added to as desired. I'll make again but with my own changes.

I added 5 bullion cubes, ketchup and garlic powder and this was so very tasty. I also added the veggies (plus green beans) 30 min after the meat boiled. Cooked app an hour and half and it was very tender and tasty.

This recipe is awesome!!!  I did make a few changes based on other reviews.  I seasoned the flour with black pepper, cumin, paprika & garlic salt.  I sweated the onion and garlic in the pot with the meat once it was browned, then added 5 cups of water with 4 crushed bouillion cubes, worchestershire sauce, oregano and an extra bay leaf.  I substituted peas for the corn.  I also added the tblsp of cornstarch per the recipe at the end.....it was completely delicious and my husband can't wait till I make it again.  Thanks!!!

I really enjoyed this recipe. I did make some small adjustments for more flavour. I replaced the water for some low sodium beef broth. I also replaced the shortening for some oil, just my preference. And I skipped the Worcestershire sauce and corn because I didn't have any. The key to this recipe is to simmer for the full 2 hours and the meat just melts in your mouth! I have put this recipe in my box to try again.

As others have indicated, this is a good starter, but needs more attention to flavor. I am "rounding up" to 4 stars, from more of a 3.5 feel for the "as written" version. The "fixes" for the basic included tomatoes, beef broth for half the liquid. But I was glad to find this starter recipe...because it has been quite a while since having made beef stew, and this definitely pointed me in the right direction.

The first time I made this recipe, I added more water (total of 6 cups) as others had suggested; the flavor was good, but it was too soupy for our taste.  This time I used the 4 cups of water and it was absolutely perfect, without a doubt the best beef stew I have ever eaten.  I used 3 beef bouillon cubes instead of the salt, and 6 whole shallots instead of the onion, with a little more corn than 1/2 cup.  I think there was a little more than a pound of beef, too. Other than that, I didn't do any tinkering with the recipe--it just doesn't need it, because it's great as is.  I have also used pork instead of beef, with peas instead of corn in this case, and it also came out great. Thanks for sharing this one.

Fabulous! I loved this stew. I added 4 beef boullion cubes while the beef was cooking, and also added celery with the other vegtables.Also, I mixed cornstarch and water together seperately, to avoid clumps, and added it to the last few minutes of cooking to thicken up the stew. It was wonderful. Perfect for a cold night!
Thanks so much for sharing!

This is going to be my go to stew recipe. I'm sure the flavor would have been satisfactory as written but I still changed it a bit. I seasoned the dredging flour with a sprinkle of season salt and oregano and then used the remaining flour at the end to thicken. I sauted the onions and fresh garlic with the beef before adding the beef broth which I used instead of just water and added a splash of red wine in the final stage. It's a real good recipe to make your own.

I was definitely wary of this recipe as the ingredients and seasonings didn't seem to be extensive. It turned out GREAT! I used the 4 cups of water called for and added 4 beef boullion cubes. I doubled the amount of beef, garlic, potatoes and carrots and added celery and peas as well as the corn (peas and corn thrown in before serving). With the flour used to brown the meat I added 1 tsp. original Mrs. Dash. The leftover seasoned flour I used to thicken the stew at the end of cooking time...The meat was VERY tender and all the flavors tasted awesome together! I will definitely make this again and will most likely never make beef stew in a crock pot again!

This was another keeper recipe! I didn't thicken the gravy as written though, I left the meat in and made my roux seperately. Just a 1/4 cup of flour mixed with enough water to make like pancake batter consistency and poured it in...voila! Perfect! =)

This was pretty good.   I cut up 2 slices of bacon real fine and rendered these before adding the floured beef.  I added about 4 cloves of garlic with about 1 cup each of onions and celery and carrots which were all cut small and added after the beef was brown.  I added about 1-1/2 TBS worcestire sauce, about 3 bay leaves, and about 6 cups of water with 4 packets of low-sodium beef boullion and brought to a boil.  Then simmered for about 3 hours.  I had to degrease the broth at this point, then i added in about 4 large carrots, chunked, and 3 potatoes.  After about 15 minutes, I added a roux of flour and water to thicken up the stew properly, and then added frozen peas (no corn).  My husband always insists on mashed potatoes with dishes like this, so I served those on the side.

This was a fantastic stew!!  However I did a few things diffently I omited the corn added 2 extra cups of water with beef bouillon, and near the end of the cooking time added 2 tablespoons of corn starch and 1/2 cup of water this gave it a great consistency. Good luck

This is the best beef stew ever!  Everyone loved it and my husband took the leftovers to work for lunch today.  I followed the recipe exactly, but instead of removing all the meat when I added the cornstarch, I just mixed the cornstarch on the side with a little water and dumped that right in.  I will have to triple this recipe next time!  Thanks a lot!

I followed this recipe to the letter and it was a great success. The only thing I did differently was cook dumplings (made with Bisquick) in the stew at the end.

The recipe, as is, taste bland and has no beef flavor to be called "beef stew".  I've never made it this way, but thought I would give it a try since the rating was so high. There must be a lot of people who have not had truly good beef stew. The one good quality was the tenderness of the beef. I will definately add beef stock as I normally would next time.

Let's face it--it's all in the broth when you're ready to serve.  I simmered in beef broth, added extra garlic, almost all the seasonings others had suggested (celery, a little cumin, basil), and it turned out "biscuit-soppin'" good.

Good stew.  I doubled the seasoning and floured meat in pan.  I deglazed pan with red wine and stuck in the crock pot for about 6 hours.  In last hour I added potatos, carrots and a can of corn.  I thickened with mash potato flakes.  Makes a nice thick hearty stew.   Also good to deglaze with beer.

I made this stew today. I used beef stock instead of water. I think it could have used rosemary but it was really really good. I would make this time and time again. My kids loved it. I did not take the meat out before thickening and all was good. soooooo gooooood. ( I had two bowels :) )

Bland as all get out, sorry.  Beef stew needs to be hearty, beefy and tasty.  This just didn't cut it for my family.  It is too watery, and needs to cook longer to tenderize the meat.  You don't need to remove the meat when thickening - just use a flour shaker to shake flour into the stew until your desired consistency.  I don't add corn, but have added green beans, which the family prefers.  The key to a good beef stew is a thick, hearty sauce/broth - it shouldn't be soup like, which is what we got with this.  I had to doctor it up quite a bit (spices) and cook it much longer to get it where we like it (thick and hearty).

This was a good recipe overall but I did find some tweaking necessary.  I used a carton of beef broth in place of the water and was very glad I did, I will keep that change when making in the future.  I think it would have been pretty tasteless otherwise.  If using broth (vs. stock that does not have added salt) you do need to omit the 1 tsp of salt or it will be too salty, just salt to taste at the end if it needs a little more.  I also upped the pepper to 1/2 tsp and omitted the corn, just for personal preference.  I may add some shiitake mushrooms next time.  But otherwise the seasonings and directions were great!  Will definitely make again with those adjustments.

This was absolutely delicious. It really reminded me of the stew my mom used to make me, I think she must have also put corn in hers. So that was nice. I just made a few minor changes... used olive oil to brown the meat instead of shortening, added 2 cloves of garlic while meat was browning, omitted onions, added another bay leaf, and added 2 stalks of celery, chopped. Also, I used instant potato flakes to thicken it up instead of cornstarch (I think it's much easier and gets better results). We loved it! Served with french bread to mop up the sauce... perfect for a cold, snowy night. Thank you!

I gave this recipe 3 stars because it had good consistency and is a base for potentially great stew.  I simmered the meat for only 1.5 hr and didn't need thickeners at the end of the cook time.  I added celery and accidentally a little extra Worcestershire, but those changes alone were not enough to make a flavorful dish.  I always like to give a new recipe the benefit of the doubt, so I really try to prepare as written.  However, for this recipe, my strong advice is to follow reviewers' suggestions for additional seasoning.  As written, this is very plain and disappointing.

I don't like beef stew, but my son requested me to make it. I think it turned out delicious but I did make some changes. I used all beef broth for the liquid. I put the spices in the flour and then dredged the beef in it. I used a better quality beef than stew meat and doubled the amount. I also added a can of diced tomatoes with the vegetables along with half a bag of frozen green beans. I doubled the carrots and used red potatoes with skins on. Plus, I quartered some baby mushrooms. The tomatoes give it a little too much tomato flavoring so I added a tablespoon of cocoa which toned it down and gave it a very rich, brown color. It was wonderful. Even I liked it!

This was everything I could hope for in an excellent beef stew! The flour and cooking process result in a great gravy that is smooth, thick and perfectly flavored. This is nothing fancy- just a real down-home stew that everyone loved! It will be my NEW standard beef stew recipe!

this is a very basic stew, very easy to make. it tastes what you imagine stew to taste like, sort of bland. i added an extra onion because i love onions, and improvised on the seasonings a bit, added rosemary, thyme, and a bit of smoke flavor, but other than that i stayed true to the recipe. it goes great with a loaf of french bread and some salad.

A good "launching" off recipe.  I used beef broth instead of the water for a fuller flavor, and added a few crushed and minced garlic cloves (hey, everythings better with garlic LOL).  Make this stew and a loaf of crusty bread and you've got a great rainy autumn afternoon dinner.

Thank You, Joanne, for helping me with my first beef stew.  This was really good.  I put all the dry spices (except for the salt and plus some garlic powder) in a zip loc bag along with the flour and tossed the beef around in there before I browned the beef in olive oil.  After that I added 2 cups beef broth, a cup of burgundy cooking wine and a cup of water and followed the recipe from there.  I mixed up the cornstarch with a little cold water, didn't remove the beef to thicken and had no problem.  This was really good and stays in my recipe book.

VBRY GOOD!  Doubling the recipe makes a large dutch oven pot FULL!  Just fits!  I made the following changes:  added - 1 can drained corn instead of 1/2c frozen, 1 can green beans, 1 large can diced tomatoes- drained.
I used 6T cornstarch and 6T water - perfect for thickening a doubled recipe.  
Used 1 can beef broth and enough water to make 6 cups total for the 4c water called for.
Used olive oil instead of shortening to brown beef.  The cooking times were exactly right!  My husband loved it - even wanted to take it with him to work.  Very hearty and good!  Next time I would use flour instead of cornstarch - Just a matter of preference - I prefer the texture of flour for thickening.  THanks!  I'll keep this one.

This was my first time making beef stew and it turned out fabulous. I added 2 bouillon cubes as others suggested and added some quartered button mushrooms right at the end. I found the carrots and potatoes needed only about 25 minutes of cooking. I used canned instead of frozen corn and I really like the taste the corn added. I am looking forward to having the leftovers tomorrow night as I expect it will taste even better.

This reminds me of an old recipe for beef stew that I had lost.  Thanks for giving it back to me.  I added 1 1/2 cups of tomato juice & 2 beef bouillon cubes and omitted the corn.  This was delicious.

I read all the rave reviews about this stew and decided to give it a try.  It was very bland, but smelled delicious while it was cooking.  The meat did come out tender, and the vegetables just right.  I would add a lot more seasonings to get this just right.

This is a great stew!  Very filling.  The only thing I would say is that this could use more than 1 pound of meat, and possibly additional seasonings/flavor.

Good recipe! Loved the flavor. I adjusted it some (added more vegetables). I also didn't need the flour or cornstarch-it was plenty thick enough. Overall very good!

Pretty good but not great. The only thing I did differently was no paprika, I was out, and I don't think that would make or break it. I was looking for a stew without celery and this fit the bill. It is missing something. I may try it with rosemary next time. It's a keeper for sure, thank you for submitting it. This recipe is good as is or using as a starter to add to.

This is a great base for beef stew.  There's room to expand upon it and tweak... and yes, as others have said, it can be a bit bland if you don't throw in some beef broth or bouillon or onion soup mix or something.  I throw in cabbage and turnips as well, and I toss the onions and garlic in with the browning meat.

I thought this recipe was pretty good, it had all the basics but I made a few changes.  I started by making a roux to thicken the sauce and then added the dredged beef to brown. I took others' advice and used beef broth. Instead of corn and carrots I did frozen mixed veggies (because that's what I had on hand) and doubled the garlic.  I also used 2 bay leafs and added a medium pinch of dried thyme - not too much though.  Turned out very well!

This was a good stew recipe but I was hoping that it would be a little more like a broth instead of the thick stew base. Read the title right!? Well, I was trying to see how it turned out. I still may keep the recipe but remove the flour. Sometimes I like a thick stew base and sometimes I don't. :-)

A HUGE hit at last night's party.  Covered the beef in salt/pepper/half tsp of cumin before dredging it in flour.  Sauteed the onions and garlic in 2 tsp of tomato paste before deglazing the pot with beef broth (instead of water).  Added 1 cup of red wine (cabernet) to the pot with the carrots and potatoes.  Two bay leaves were definitely needed.

Very good basic stew recipe!  I used beef broth instead of the water which added a nice flavor.  Remember not to boil but simmer the meat.  Makes it much more tender.  Enjoy!

This was not stew. It was soupy and lacked flavor!! I would substitute water for beef broth or a red wine next time. I added more garlic and potatoes as well.

Seasoned the meat before dredging. Added extra veg (celery, carrots & corn) as suggested by others. Brown well for flavour. I used a Hunter gravy package to thicken the broth.  Remarkably simple but hearty stew. It's a keeper.

A very good stew. I substituted 2 cups of beef stock + 2 cups of water for the 4 cups of water, just to add more flavor. Other changes I made were to add an extra bay leaf and 3 stalks of celery. Instead of regular paprika I used smoked paprika and I used white pepper instead of black pepper. I also took the advice of an earlier review to bring the ingredients to a boil and then to move the pot to a 350 degree oven and cook for two hours. Add the vegetables and then back in the oven for 45 minutes. I really think that was good advice. The meat came out fork tender and the vegetables were delicious. I must say though that I don't feel it served a true six servings, more like four. I think I'll double the recipe the next time I make it.

This turned out great! I did sub in beef stock for the water and instead of corn - I used peas because that's what we had in the freezer.  I did not remove the meat before I thickened it.  This was a wonderful dish on a cold wintry night!  Try it!

DONNAINNC made a great suggestion Jan 7 2004, when she suggested adding things like BBQ sauce, ketchup and the like!  WOW!  I have been slow cooking my stews for so long (and waiting all day), this took about two hours, and the taste far outweighs the old way I did things!! I used to add onion soup mix to my slow cooker, and it wasn't bad, but this taste is super yummy!

For years I made a similar stew in a pressure cooker.  This stew was even better.  I took the advice of many reviewers with a couple other twists, and it turned out perfectly.  I browned the beef dredged in flour, salt and pepper/garlic seasoning in olive oil then added chopped onion and 3 garlic cloves until soft.  I combined water, 1/2 cup of powdered french onion beef stock,  Worcestershire sauce, 3 bay leaves and beef mixture in a covered bean pot and placed in oven at 350 degrees for about 2-1/2 hours.  Added potatoes, carrots, a sliced sweet potato and 3 sliced celery stalks & baked for about another hour.  Beef fell apart and vegetables were perfectly cooked.  The additional seasonings and stock combined with flour made a perfect, flavorful gravy.  To thicken a little more I added a small amount of instant potato flakes as someone  suggested.  Excellent on a cold day!

Good basic stew recipe.  I used canola oil instead of shortening.  Does not need additional flour for thickening.

I too made a few changes...you know-to make it my own.  Used Olive oil to brown the meat, used mostly beef broth, added a can of chopped stewed tomatoes, 3 stalks of chopped celery, left out the worchestshire sauce, and then about 15 minutes before we eat I cut refrigerator biscuits into 1/4's and drop individually into the stew to make dumplings...mmm, just like moms!

This was really good but only with the changes I made. I added 4 cups of Beef Broth, 1 cup of Tomato Juice, 1 cup of water. I ended up throwing the spices in with the flour in a ziploc bag with the meat to coat. The spices I used was paprika, organo, seasoning salt, and garlic salt. And I also added about 3-4 Tbsp. of Hickory Smoke BBQ Sauce. I then added a few stalks of celery instead of corn. It was delicious! My boyfriend raved about it, and the leftovers were gone the next day!

I don't think anyone could possibly screw up this recipe. A great base that you can spice up as much as you want. I used leftover pot roast instead of stew beef. Started by adding onion, garlic and celery to canola oil in pan, then once those were softened, added the chopped up pot roast that I had tossed in flour. Used beef broth instead of water. Continued as directed after that, but as suggested by other reviewers added a tablespoon each of chili sauce, ketchup, and a teaspoon of sugar. Also added about a cup of leftover gravy.  Because I used pot roast, the meat fell apart in the stew which I think makes it taste better! But I think you could do just about anything to this wonderful basic recipe and it would taste great. Thanks for posting it!

Turns out great but with changes.  Needs a lot more spices.  I added oregano, thyme and garlic powder and more garlic, pepper and two extra bay leaves.  Others have added tomatoes or ketchup  but I find gravy is the best addition.  I prepare the gravy according to the package and add about half to the stew.  I also increased and added beef bouillon to the water- from four cups to six (1tsp per cup).  I start with the four then add the other two with the potatoes, carrots, celery and mushrooms.  Next time I will cut the potatoes smaller because it seemed to take longer than 45 minutes and then the beef, though super tender, was falling apart.  I may either cut my time for cooking the meat and make smaller cubes or I'll make bigger cubes for the two hours.  But we loved the end result anyway. I dissolved cornstarh in a bit of water and added it at the end and before the peas (which I add at the end instead of the corn). This way you don't have to take the meat out. It was very tasty-yum!

This is another one that I have made for sometime now. I do change several things though. I do not use shortening, I use vegetable oil instead. I omit the corn and add extra potatos and carrots. To thicken it up after simmering for a while I add some ketchup and barbecue sauce, a bit of A-1 sauce if I have it and a tablespoon or so of sugar. I also add, garlic, onion powder and a few dashes of jerk seasoning to taste . It is a definite... mom, can I have 
seconds from my son :) It is very bland on its own but with my additions it adds great flavor.

This is a wonderful stew. I tweak to my taste by using beef broth instead of water and skipping the cornstarch.

I thought this recipe was very, very good.  I filled a zip lock bag with 1/4 cup of flour and a teaspoon each of garlic salt, onion powder, black pepper and Adobo seasoning mixture.  I placed the stew meat in the bag to coat and then browned the meat in olive oil.  I used 4 cups of beef broth instead of the water and only had to cook the beef for an hour and it was plenty tender.  I then added the carrots, potatoes and corn and cooked for an additonal 30 minutes.  I didn't need to add any cornstarch or flour to thicken the sauce, it was perfect as is!  My family raved over the meal and even my picky 2 year old ate it!  Thanks for sharing.

This stew is very tasty, I did add 3 cups of beef broth in addition to the water, and cut the potaotes up in 1 inch chunks, as well as the carrots.
In the end I mixed the corn starch with a little cold water first then added it to the stew, there was no need to remove the beef, its just easier.

Great Stew.  The only thing I changed was instead of using water, I used beef stock.  Definitely would make again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a good recipe.  I doubled it and added more vegetables, green beans, more corn even peas.  Also substituted water for wine and beef broth. Added lots of garlic and the result was a total success.  Great item for a cold fall evening

I read what the other reviews said about the lack of taste and they were all correct, there was no flavor at first. So, I used only two cups of water and 2 cups of beef broth, then I added a tsp of chilli powder, cayanne pepper and last a store bought package of beef stew mix. I cooked the beef in the broth in a slow cooker for about 6 hours then thru in the vegetables for the last 1 1/2 hours. The definatley is the best stew  to learn off of and create your own personal recipe from. My family loved the way ours came out. Thanks Joanne!

This was the first time I made a stew and it was great.  I followed other reviewers and mixed a bowl of equal parts water and cornstarch, and added it without removing the meat.  I also used 2lbs meat, and used canned corn.  My husband and toddler both loved it!

I was a bit skeptical about this recipe at first, but I decided to go on and try it out.  I'm glad that I did, because this beef stew was the best that I've EVER had.  I was even asked for the recipe by those that find my cooking bad.  So if you are wanting a hearty stew, this one is the one to pick!

This was the best recipe I have found for Beef Stew!  No one at my dinner table complained!  With three small children all under 7 and a picky husband - that's a first.  Thank you so much for sharing.  My son even helped out [he's 3].

I thought that this was excellent.  Easiest and best stew I have eaten besides my grandmothers.  I added a can of french cut green beans when I added the corn.  I also had to add a can of beef broth for flavor and because it didnt seem to have enough broth.  I woud definitely give this a try.

This was the best beef stew recipe I've ever made! I did change a few things though. I actually seasoned my flour with some garlic salt, paprika, onion powder, and black pepper and threw in the beef pieces and shook to coat. I browned it in canola oil since I didn't have shortening. I then added half water and half beef broth. I only used half of the liquid that was originally called for because I didn't want to cook down all of the liquid. Whenn I got ready to do my potatoes and carrots, I added the other half. I also added extra worstershire sauce, 2tbs if done as is (I like lots of flavor and it wasn't overpowering) I ommited the corn, and instead added celery. I didn't need to use extra corn starch or flour, it was plenty thick when finished. I cooked the meat for an hour and a half and the potatoes and carrots 35 minutes,a and lastly the onions and celery an additional 15 minutes. The potatoes were a little over cooked, so you might want to lower the heat or cook for about 20-25 minutes instead.

Good. But not excellent. I took the advice of Donnainnc and added the extra flavors she suggested and was greatly disappointed. It was very, very spicy (and this coming from someone that eats peppers plain and handles spice nicely). I had to hurry and cook an alternative meal for my children. Most of this stew was left uneaten. Please don't add the ingredients she/ he suggests. You lose the stew flavor.

I followed the recipe except for the corn kernels since i had none, but I doubt that would make a significant difference in taste.  The stew was okay, my family did not rave about it so it got three stars.    That said, I have tried four of the top rated stew recipes here and have yet to find anything we enjoy enough to prepare again.  I'll continue trying till I find the right one for our families taste.

We really enjoyed this stew.  I increased the spices a bit and added an extra bay leaf, beef bouillon, and garlic.  I also didn't take the meat out when I thickened the stew (too lazy), and it still came out great. My only complaint was it didn't make a lot.  Next time I'll double the recipe...it was tasty!

I scaled this up to 75 for an event and it turned out great. My only change was omitting the corn and bay leaves and adding green beans and some broccoli about 30 minutes before serving it. Everyone love having something cooked from scratch!

Outstanding! This recipe turned out fantastic. I followed the recipe step by step the only changes I made was to eliminate the bay leaf because I didnt have one. I added frozen peas and corn at the end and a teaspoon of smokey tabassco sauce and it was delicious

Fantastic stew! I made a few changes - substituted the water for beef broth and added 1/4 cup of red wine. My husband can't eat onions so I added the paprika, salt, pepper and onion powder to the flour to dredge the meat with, but also added the paprika, pepper (no more salt) and onion powder to the beef broth and wine to simmer for 2 hours. The veggies - I also added celery and green beans and substituted the white potatoes for sweet potatoes. I also made fresh bread in my bread maker to go with it. This is a fabulous hearty stew!! Thanks!!

Okay so this recipe is in my crockpot as we speak & I keep taking tastes of it & I can't stop! I did dredge the meat in flour but to the flour I added seasoning salt, salt, pepper & the paprika. I dredged the meat & browned it in olive oil & garlic. Then I dumped that into my crock pot & added the 4c. of water but to the water I added 2 beef bullion cubes & a tsp. of browning sauce. I added some dried onion flakes because I dont' like big chunks of onion & I didn't have any real onion on hand. Then I added the spices: a little more paprika, seasoning salt, garlic salt, salt & pepper. I didn't add the bay leaf because I didn't have any. After cooking the meat & the juice for about 3 hours, I added choppped carrots & celery. I cooked those for about an hour & then added the potatoes & cooked for another hour. I didn't think it needed to be thickened because the starch from the potatoes seemed to help it. This was delicious!! And perfect on a rainy day! Thanks for the recipe!

Used olive oil instead of shortening as other reviewers suggested; used beef broth/bouillon cubes instead of water; simply cut the onion into eighths; and, after browning the meat (which I sprinkled with garlic powder and fresh ground pepper before flouring) in the cast iron casserole dish, added the broth, onions, splash of red wine, about 1/4 cup catsup, about 1 cup of baby bella mushrooms that I chopped really fine in the processor (as hubby won't eat them if he can see them), and cooked in the oven at 225 for most of the afternoon.  Then added shredded carrots and sliced potatoes, along with a can of cream of chicken and an envelope of brown gravy powder mix and put back into the oven at 300 for another hour or so.  Added a drained and rinsed can of Lesueur early peas just before serving. Yummy!!

This was a great recipe once it was modified taking in mind other reviewers' suggestions.  I mixed the flour with spices before dredging the meat in it.  I browned it in sunflower oil instead of shortening.  I added bouillon cubes to the water for extra flavor, and I added some ketchup and chili sauce as well.  I didn't cook the meat the full 2 hrs., but maybe it came out so tender anyway b/c I used a more expensive cut of meat.  For veggies, I used not only potatoes and carrots, but also sweet potatoes, squash, eggplant, and cabbage for extra vitamins and roughage.  I'd added a spoonful of sugar early on, based on another reviewer's recommendation, but b/c the sweet potatoes added natural sweetness, I'll omit this next time.  It didn't need any thickening in the end, so I just finished it off with a can of green beans and can of corn.  DH and I both loved it!  I can't wait to make it again!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe to tweak as we like! :)

Delicious!  What a wonderful recipe!  I could have eaten the veggies and broth without the meat!  I used all the ingredients in this recipe but as sugested by others, I also added another bay leaf, added a little thyme and rosemary.  I used beef broth but did add one cup of water.  While all my ingredients were simmering, I also added a chopped jalapeno to give it a kick.  I added peas and carrots at the end.  I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe! The recipe calls for 4 cups of water. I varied this slightly - 1 cup of tomato juice, 1 cup of beef stock and 2 cups of water. Instead of the frozen corn, I added a stalk of chopped celery. I found this had enough liquid for me so next time I will add 1/2 lb more beef, and an extra carrot and celery stalk. I substituted the salt with garlic salt, which I added to the dredging flour. Fantastic.

Great basic recipe for a stew. I omit corn and use celery, use beef broth instead of water, and definitely add more Worcestershire and some A-1. Other than that, this is a solid recipe.

This is a good recipe, but I felt it needed more flavor than the original recipe calls for. I seasoned my flour with seasoned salt, paprika, and garlic powder. While the stew simmered, I added dried thyme, Italian seasoning, and dry onion soup mix. Highly recommended recipe. Great comfort food for a cool fall day.

This is a wonderful savory stew with a rich broth that warms you body and soul. I exchanged two cups of beer for two of the cups of water and I also added to bouillion cubes. Be sure to let the stew sit before you serve it. It will thicken and you won't have to add additional flour.

Definately the best stew I have ever had!  (Also the 1st one I have ever made!)  I added chopped celery to it - but that's all.  We think that it would be AWESOME served in a bread bowl on a cold winter day.  It seemed like a lot of work, but man o man was it worth it!!!

We loved this.  Very flavorful, very easy.  I didnt even have time to cook it as long as the recipe called for, and it still turned out great.  Only changes I made were canned corn instead of frozen, and I added a handful of fresh green beans.  Will definately make again.

Substitute 3 cups of vegetable juice for 3 cups of water. Add a teaspoon of beef bouillon granules. A little marjoram, a little oregano, and you have the best tasting beef stew in the world.

I prepared this recipe by first braising the stew meat with salt, pepper, garlic, onions and a little meat tenderizer, let it sit overnight in a mixture of beef broth (about half a box) tomato juice(half a jar or so)more garlic, paprika, sugar,dash of Worcestershire sauce ground mustard and chili sauce, then the following day put the mixture in the crock pot adding carrots, celery, potatoes and a little more chopped onion and cooked on high for about 6 hours.  The sauce is a little spicy, but not over the top hot, and tastes much better the second day after it all mixes together. Thank you for the recipe!

This definitely needs doctoring up, as one reviewer put it.  Definitely use 3 c. beef broth instead of water, with one cup of red wine.  Also, add more bay leaves and I added more Worcestershire.  I should have added more garlic and added more beef or veggies.  It needs another spice, like thyme or something to spice it up a bit, otherwise it's too bland.

I didn't use any water at all: I substituted 4C (1box) Campbell's Beef Broth. Wonderful! Next time I'll substitute 1C for red wine. I also "toasted" (in a pan on the stove) 2T of flour, made a roux and added it at the end. Also added mushrooms, left-over corn niblets.
THEN it was delicious!

This is a simple traditional recipe that is really easy to follow, and your food comes out great! This is my first time making stew, and the recipe is perfect for someone without a slow cooker. The paprika added a nice coloring to the stew, and it actually took me a lot less time than estimated. Thanks!

This was a good base for stew -  next time i will add bullion and tomatoes as others have suggested -it lacked the rich flavor I was looking for. BUT, great recipie for a beginner like me.

I added water to the recipie because the 4 cups simmered down too much.  Other than that, this is a keeper and REALLY wonderful!

This is a overall great recipe!  I did make a few changes to it though, instead of beef I used deer and I also added mixed frozen vegetables instead of just the frozen corn.  The deer melted in your mouth, I also added dumplings to it. I will make this one again, that's for sure!!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I used 3 pounds of top round. I skipped the corn and garlic. I added 8 grams of beef broth seasoning. I used 4 big carrots and 5 potatoes.  For the thickener I used 5 tbsp cornstarch w/ 5 tbsp cold water. I put in about 6 cups of water overall. I simmered the meat for only an hour. The beef was very tender. My husband had it w/ rice and I ate it plain.

Wonderful recipe, I didn't dredge the meat in the flour and just sprinkled it over the meat while it was browning. (A time saver tip from my Grandma) It worked out real good.  I also added dumplings to the stew, adding a little Poultry seasoning and some dried parsley to the dumpling mixture to add a little flavor.  All in all, verrrrrry gooooooood recipe. Thank You!

This came out great. I made one small substitution and substituted 2 cups of low sodium beef broth for 2 of the water.  It's a good basic stew.

I like this recipe- for me though, too much flour and I personally prefer no corn in my stew- frozen petite peas instead! For quickness I go with either beef broth or French onion soup for the flavoring. The bay leaf is a good addition, beef stew is not the same without it.

Good recipe added more spice then suggested. Mixed all the spices in the flour mixture then coated the meat and browned it. Added the water then put it in the oven on 325 for 3 hours. Easier then doing it all on the stove top. Served it with yorkshire pudding it was awesome.

Very good, i did need to add some beef boulion to this because there just didn't seem be enough flavor to it.  After i add it this was very good.  I think next time to add to the flavor i will add a can of tomatoes and use less water.

Very good with the following changes.  Dredged beef in flour seasoned with teaspoon of seasoning salt and 1/8 t pepper.  Browned in EVOO.  Deglazed the pan with water.  Returned meat to pan and added 4 beef bouillon cubes, onion, garlic, bay, teaspoon of rosemary and 1/2 teaspoon of thyme.  Left the paprika and worcestershire sauce out because I didn't have any.  Cooked as directed.  Also subbed green beans and peas for the corn.  Delicious and easy!!

This turned out oh-so-yummy! I mixed salt, pepper, and cumin into the flour before I dredged smaller, bite-size pieces (I have younger kids) of round steak in it. Then I browned the beef in oil, slipped in a couple tbls of butter, and added some minced garlic and chopped onion. I followed others recommendations by adding beef bouillon to half of the water and then simmering for 2 hours before I stirred in the vegetables. I turned up the heat a little and used the remaining flour to thicken it up. I will keep this recipe!!!

absolutely yummm! my husband loves this!! to cut down cook time a ton, i added  the potatoes to the broth early instead of cooking them on the side like another reviewer mentioned, i did use the bullion and beef stock and a little water, and fully cooked the meat on the side. otherwise, i haven't changed a thing!

I liked this recipe.  I added beef stock and did find the Worchestershire a bit strong at first (I'd definitely reduce the quantity then next time) but over all, I totally enjoyed this.

Minor changes based on others' feedback. Shook cubes in a bag with flour, onion, garlic powders, pepper. Used baby carrots (cut in two). Doubled the liquid.  Overall, it was very good. Am wondering if I'd simmered the meat 1.5 to 2 hrs if it would have been more tender. Healthy and filling meal.

Mmmmm!  Started late, so I didn't have time to do stew in a slowcooker, but really liked stove top results better as everything was less mushy with more defined tastes.   I added onion and garlic powder, Italian seasoning, and salt-free Spike to the flour to toss w/ meat, added one can of salt free diced tomatoes, and celery in with the veggies, but otherwise followed recipe pretty closely.   At the last minute, couldn't resist adding on some bisquick dumplings (found on one of the other stew recipes) but they didn't cook up as well as I hoped...   This is a WONDERFUL comfort food for a cold evening!!  Warms up the hous and your belly!!!

This was great.  I only gave it four stars because I didn't follow the recipe exactly, I seasoned it to our liking instead.  I have to say though, that the end result was perfect and the premise of the recipe is great.

I'm giving this 4 stars.  This a great basic stew recipe but with a few small changes I think it's even better.  Like others, I used beef broth in place of the water.  Makes it much richer.  I increased the worchestershire to 1 1/2 Tablespoons, increased garlic to 3 cloves, and then added 3/4 t of thyme, basil leaves and 1/8 t black pepper.  I added 1 can (14oz) diced tomatoes, undrained. Other than these changes everything else was unchanged.

This is the first time I've made a stew without using a crockpot, & it was delicious! Like the other reviews I've read, I used 6 cups of beef broth & added some Italian seasoning. It was perfect for a rare snowy day in Houston.

Wow!  This was the best stew I ever had!  I did make some changes that the other reviews suggested which I believe made the stew more flavorful.  I used beef broth instead of water, and did not add the corn.  I also did not thicken the stew with the cornstarch mixture.  My family perfers a "bothy" stew.  I did dredge the stew meat in flour, salt, pepper and paprika before browning - and I used two pounds of meat because that is what I had on hand.  Normally I don't review recipes if I made changes with but this was such a great stew especially if you are looking for a recipe without a tomato base.

I made this and my husband and I absolutely loved it!  It was simple and had a lot of flavor.  I did substitute the water with beef broth.  Usually we would have leftovers for days but today, there aren't any!  Very good!!!

This stew is delicious!  I have made it twice and both times it turned out great!  The first time I followed the recipe and the second time I used the crock pot.    I browned the meat on the stove then added everything according to the directions to the crockpot.  I add 1 can of Beef broth just to make it have a little more juice.  When it says to remove the beef and make the soup thicker with flour, I remove everything and then scoop some juice into a bowl and add about 4 Tbl. of flour, whisk then pour back in and stir.  Add back in the meat and veggies, then continue to cook on High until the potatoes are cooked through.  I used Red potatoes instead of Idaho and I think I let it cook for about 4-5 hours on High or until the potatoes were to my liking.

This was a great recipe, though I did make some modifications. I used 4 cups of beef broth and only about a cup of water. I added about 3x the garlic as well as some celery. Between the broth and the potatoes no thickening agent was necessary. Before browing the meat I dredged them in flour mixed with garlic powder, pepper, and seasoned salt. That gave the meat wonderful flavor when it came time to eat! Solid recipe that will become a family staple!

I didn't have any shortening, so I browned the meat in olive oil.  I also added 2 beef bouillion cubes and about 1/2 cup of red wine, and it was fantastic!  It smelled wonderful while it was cooking.  My husband loved it!

I loved this stew and it was really easy.  I didn't add the extra flour at the end or corn starch to thicken, the 3 TBLS at the beginng used to dredge the meat was plenty to make it thick.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very tasty and aromatic.  I added extra Worcestershire sauce and some Thyme, used frozen potatoes and carrots cut up for stew (frozen food section at Walmart) and cooked everything else the same.  I didn't need the extra flour at the end since it thickened up well with the potatoes in it.  Everyone had extra helpings, kids included. Very easy!

I tried this recipe a few days back and it got rave reviews from everyone who had it!! I didn't put in any W. sauce and didn't have any bay leaf. I added a little white sauce at the end which made it thicker and super creamy, even though without it it still tasted faaantastic!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  My kids who are picky eaters didn't care for it but they are more interested in chicken nuggets, french fries, etc.  But I enjoyed it and found that I didn't need to add the flour at the end because the potatoes thickened the stew up.

This was a great and easy stew recipe, but there was not enough flavor for me  Even after doubling a lot of the seasonings, both my husband and I found we had to still add additional seasonings to make it flavorful enough.    Next time I'll get very creative on my spices.

This recipe was pretty good...I did make a couple changes.  I used 1 can of beef broth and 2 1/2 c. water.  Also, I put more meat (2 lbs.) and used more carrots and potatoes.  I also used frozen mixed veggies instead of just the corn.  Next time, I won't put the frozen veggies.  I also, seasoned the flour.  Overall, not too bad!

Superb! We totally loved this stew. I recommend cutting everything up into half-inch cubes (esp. beef), that will reduce the cooking time down to about an hour rather than two hours. Instead of garlic bulbs, I used garlic powder. I recommend mixing all of the powders and spices with the flour and dredging the beef with this mixture. I also took the advice of some of the other folks here and used the remaining spiced flour to thicken the stew.

It is so nice to know how to put together a warm and comforting stew. I doubled this recipe and followed direction exactly, but added mushrooms a little brocolli, parsnips and fresh tomatoes. I think you cou;d add whatever you had on hand. This was a great meal served with garlic bread. It reheats nicely and I think the flavour improves after a day or two. Everyone in the family enjoyed this.

This was very good. I used left over chuck roast with juices. Added both corn and peas. Did not have a Bay leaf, so used fresh basil (would be better with the Bay leaf). Will use this recipe again.

Delicious - the only change that I made was substituting frozen peas (that I previously cooked) for the corn.  I also add extra potatoes, onions, and carrots based on what cooks like a good mix.

I didnt care for this recipe it was very dry.  Maybe if you double the liquid ingredients with spices it wouldnt be so dry.

This recipe is delicious... when altered a bit.  I got a few ideas from other reviews.  I only added 2 c water and added 1 c red wine, beef boullion, and 1 14.5oz can of stewed tomatoes.  I also added spiced to the flour before I dreged the beef in it.  I didn't thicken the soup.  I liked it the way it was.

Very Very Good!  The only change I made was I seasoned my flour for dredging the stew meat.  I wish you could smell the outcome! (it tastes just as great too!)

I thought this stew was fabulous!! It wasn't to soupy, like a lot of stews are. It was very thick and the taste was perfect. My husband doesn't really care for stew, but he loved this recipe. This recipe will be in our family for life!

I can't figure out where all the 5 star ratings are coming from.  This recipe is terribly bland, flavorless actually.  When I added the corn I tasted the broth and I knew that no one in my house would even eat it so I added a can of beef broth as well as some extra spices and then it was okay but still nothing special.

A+, The whole family loved it.  I did use onion powder, garlic powder, cyanne pepper, salt and chili powder in the flour to coat the meat.  I then saved the flour to thicken with at the end.  I didn't take the meat out to thicken the sauce (too much of a pain) and it worked just fine.  I also used a can of sliced carrots and added them at the end.

We enjoyed this hearty stew for dinner last night. I deglazed the pan with sherry cooking wine and added a scoop & a half of dried french onion soup mix as well as fresh chopped celery. I used about 6 cups of water, too, but because I added the potatoes after about 45 min, then cooked for another hour, I got to skip the thickening step. DH said it's the best he's had. Not bad considering it was my first try at beef stew. :-)

This is by far the best beef stew I have ever had. My husband and our company loved it..we had a couple teenagers over for dinner and one of them ate 4 bowls!!  It is great every time I make it and my husband begs for me to make it again often.

Very easy to put together and smells wonderful. I finished it in the slow cooker and when we came back home the aroma was fantastic. It could use a little flavor boost. Next time I may add some Cajun Magic while cooking the meat.

Very tasty, especially the second day.  I substituted dark beer for the water and omitted onions and corn.  Next time I may add beef broth instead of some of the beer.  I made it with boned chuck.

This recipe was so easy to follow and it tasted so good. It was definitely a crowd pleaser! The only thing that I changed was that I added a little Rosemary and twice the worchestershire sauce. This was my first time making a stew without a premade sauce packet.  We loved it!!

i like my stew thick and this was not at all.  i used beef broth.  needs tomato paste, more worcestershire sauce to boost the flavor quotient and a roux to thicken it. maybe if i had made dumplings, the stew would have been thicker.  so, more like a soup than a stew.  a good starting point, though.  i may make it again with those adjustments

Great stew.  I leave out the potatoes so I can serve it with mashed potatoes or noodles.  I use olive oil instead of shortening.  I omit the salt when the stock has salt.  My whole family even the picky eater loved it.

I made some changes putted 2 bay leaves B4 I putted the vegetables took it out afterwards. Added some tomato sauce to thickened the sauce at the end of simmering, came out more thicker than 1 Tb. Cornstarch n 1 Tb. Coldwater. It was better n more thicker sauce. The way how I like it over my hot Calrose Rice. Smells so onolicious after simmering everything for about 45-60 minutes, until vegetables are oh so tender!! Came out Awesome n Deliciousy good!! #LIVEALOHAZ

This was a terrific beef stew!  My family thoroughly enjoyed it.  I browned the meat on all sides in a skillet and added it to my crockpot.  I added all the other ingredients except for the corn and cornstarch, and cooked on high for around 6 hours.  It was perfect.  It didn't blow our minds, and thus the 4 stars.  I would add some cream of mushroom soup, or Lipton Onion soup to make it have more flavor.  I would also add more corn and a root vegetable like rutabaga or sweet potato.  Now that would be a 5 star stew!

Loved this. I also only cooked the meat for an hour and it was very tender. I could cut the pieces with my spoon. I put all the spices, and then some, people talked about in their reviews...yummy. I sopped up the juice with my bread. My soup was thick enough for me that I didn't need to add flour or corn starch. Definitely will do this again.

Good recipe, however it requires stirring occasionally and an additional 2 cups of water (and therefore more seasoning). I ran out of water while simmering the beef after just 1 hour. Like other reviewers, the meat didn't need 2 hours. Mine took just one before the meat was tender. Also, removing the meat before adding the flour thickening mixture was a pain.

This stew recipe is the best I have tried, the only thing I added was a beef bouillion and a lamb bouillion. It was outstanding and my husband, who is very picky, was more than happy to have leftovers the next day. Thankyou for this great recipe. Will definitely make this my only stew recipe.

This stew had good flavor, not great.  I had to add so much more seasoning than they asked for.  It also turned out very starchy and thick.  I added peas, extra garlic and more broth.

Great recipe!  Very easy.  I added a bit of merlot and about a third of a cup of ketchup toward the end to balance it out a bit.  Perfect.

This was awesome.  I was craving beef stew and this TOTALLY hit the spot.  The second time I made it I added frozen green beans and added more salt and pepper.  I will make this tons more times!

This was great! I used half beef broth and water for a little extra flavor, but less salt. I dropped in a half a can of green beans to give it some extra color. We ate it with crusty rolls and salad!

Pretty good dish. I added some red wine, rosemary, and some beef bouillon to deepen the flavor a bit. The beef was really tender and delicious. I will probably make this again.

I included diced bacon first which I fried first and then let the beef brown in the bacon fat. I also substituted beef stock for water, ommitted the frozen corn and added 1 yam with the potato.  The results were absolutely delicious!

I didn't have any worchestershire sauce or a bay leaf, so it probably would've made a difference in taste. However, I still liked it, and instead of adding corn I added peas.

I combined this stew with the French Stew on this site. The end result was tasty. Fresh carrots, onions and potatoes along with hand mixed herbs provides a fresh, clean taste. I omitted the paprika and Worcestershire but added mustard.

This was a good basic stew recipie.  The taste & consistency improved by replacing 1 cup water with 1 cup red wine.  There was alot of gravy also.. next time I would use less liquid or more veggies or meat.  I also added 3 bay leaves and doubled the flour to make thicker gravy.

What a disaster. I made this for special guests in my slow cooker. I think I  mustve skipped a step because by the morning, though it smelled heavenly, it was nothing more than brown water. I walked to the grocery store and picked up some beef stew seasoning. That saved the day. I'm not sure what I did wrong. I also called my friend at the last minute and she told me to add some roux to make it a little creamier. Worked like a charm, lunch was a success!!

Great recipe!  My whole family loved it.  I used minced onion and garlic as well as the fresh versions. I also added a can of tomato sauce in place of one cup of water. No need to add the extra flour.  Thanks, a real keeper.

I don't know what I did wrong.  I followed the recipe exactly except for adding 4 beef bouillon cubes.  The meat was way overdone - just fell apart like string.  I may try this again but if I do I will cut the total cooking time down to  1 1/2 hours total and use a combination of beef broth and water as others did.

Delicious recipe!  I did add the ketchup, sweet chili sauce and Heinz 57 as it did need a bit of a kick.  Also added chick peas and more carrots and potatoes.  The final touch was a liberal "dash" of red wine!

This as easy enough to prepare and came out looking great but really could've used a lot more spice.  It was very bland.  I think with the right spices it would be a 5 star!

This recipe was very good on a cold winter night. My husband and four year old did not like it.

This was excellent though I followed some other's tips using 2 lbs. meat, 6 cups water, 6 beef bouilon cubes, vegetable oil instead of shortening, 1 tsp. rosemary, no bay leaf mixing 6 tbsp. cornstarch with 6 tbsp. water.  I hate to change other people's recipes but I wanted to make a larger batch and it turned out GREAT!

I added the 2 extra cups of water that everyone said to but then I couldn't get it to thicken up at the end no matter how much cornstarch I added. Next time, I will stick with the 4 cups of water. I added a tsp of rosemary for flavor and it was very good.

I have tryed my own way before but it didn't turn out right.On this recipe I changed a few things. I used onion soup mix instead of an onion,I added meat tenderizer to the flour for the meat,and I didn't use the leaf.I also used green beans.

I love recipes that I can just throw in the crock pot and forget about it.  This was one on them and taste great, just ask my grandkids, twins 2 yrs old and a 6 yr old.
