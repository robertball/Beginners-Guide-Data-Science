Update again: 7-18-09 This has been the frig for several days and I had a piece last night and I really liked it, the crumble topping kinda mingled with it. Alot better after letting it sit for awhile! Will bump up a star. Original review: Made this for my MIL for her bday, picked the recipe because I had fresh cherries to use up (used fresh dark sweet cherries instead of the canned sour cherries). It was time consuming pitting them but my pie looked alot like the pic posted, so I must have done something right! Will update on taste. Update: I really didn't like the crumble topping, reminded me of apple crisp (cherry crisp in a pie shell?). I really liked the filling---it set up really well and looked really pretty-- and thought a whipped cream topping might be better suited.

This pie tasted really good.  Might not use tart cherries next time because it was a little sour for me even after adding the other ingredients.

I used fresh cherries to make this pie because it's what I had  but made no other changes. This is the best pie I have ever had. I will be making this often.

Made this for the 4th of July this year. My dad loved it. I had honestly forgot about it until recently when I was speaking to my dad on the phone & he told me, "Remember that cherry pie you made for the 4th, it was by far the best pie I have ever had." Now it is almost Christmas & I know exactly what I will be making my dad for a Christmas Day treat. Thank you, Marian. I followed your recipe with only one slight change, I used frozen tart cherries rather than canned. Superb.

This was very yummy! The cherries look a little anemic when you slice it, and it looks more like a meat pie or something! But substance makes up for lack of beauty.

Very good!  I had a little trouble finding tart cherries at the grocery store, but otherwise it was easy to make and I got lots of compliments on it.  I plan to use this recipe again.
