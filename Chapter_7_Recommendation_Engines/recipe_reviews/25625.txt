Oh So good warm with whip cream! Just as good the next day cold with coffee! I doubled the rhubarb & cut 1/2 cup sugar out. Topping was just enough. I didn't have any almonds so I put in a little almond extract. We love the tid bits of cocoanut. really makes this cake special. I only had one egg so I put in a t. baking powder and it is so light and fluffy I might do it this way every time! Real butter is a must if you want that rich taste. Oh, and the finished cake is very pretty with a golden brown top. Nice looking (quick and easy) company cake for us that have loads of rhubarb!

What a wonderful recipe.  In just the past two weeks I've made it twice.  Everytime people commented on how good it was and asked for the recipe.  People could not believe it was rhubarb cake.  I did do one thing different.  After baking the cake according to the recipe, I made a the following frosting like my mom always did.  Combine 6 Tbsp. melted butter, 2/3 cup brown sugar. 1/4 cup cream, 1 cup coconut and 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  Spread on cake.  Brown lightly under broiler.  Thanks for the recipe.

Mmmmmmm, nummy!  This is excellent.  Still warm from the oven, and delicious.  Would be good with some vanilla ice cream.  

I wouldn't have minded more rhubarb, but I used all that I had.  Probably had more than the recipe called for too!  :)  I love rhubarb.

The only changes that we made were: omitted nutmeg, almonds and coconut.  (I'm out of nutmeg and almonds and my son didn't want coconut in it.)  I also added 1/2 cup of flax meal for added nutrition.  Oh, and I didn't have any buttermilk, so I added 1 tsp. vinegar to 1 cup of regular milk.

This was about the best rhubarb cake I've tasted.  My husband loved it, I shared it with a neighbor and he called and raved about it.  I also added coconut to the topping mixture.  This is a recipe that I will make again.

This is an excellant cake. The only changes I made were I used stewed rhubarb instead of the sliced, I had stewed the rhubarb for dessert one nite and had stewed left. I did use oatmeal and coconut in the topping. This is going to be a dessert that will be used often. Thanks

Very good cake. However, you wonder where the taste of rhubarb is gone... too much cinnamon for my European taste (I'm French), but a great base recipe for an every day cake !

More importantly my husband loved it.  He ate 1/2 of the pan in one night.  It stayed very fresh.  Did leave out the coconut,almonds, and nutmeg as my son has a nut allergy.  He loved it too....

This was very good and very sweet, even though I cut back on the sugar to 1 cup, as others have recommended.  I baked mine for the full 35 mins. and it could have used more time.  I think part of the problem may have been that the rhubarb developed a bit of a juice sitting in the sugar waiting to be added in.  I think next time, I would drain the juice, although possibly that helped with the flavor.  We loved the flavor, it was just a little TOO moist and didn't cut neatly.

Definitely a moist cake and like other reviewers, reduced the sugar by 1/2 c. Also OK to sub half the white flour for whole-wheat flour. No need to grease pan. Omitted topping too.  Didn't need it. Sprinkled black walnuts on top since we process our own nuts yearly.

This is wonderful!  I put pecans in because I didn't have almonds and it was great.  Just made it again for a party and everyone raved about it.

Make this cake!  Double the rhubarb. Only use 1cup of sugar. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 1/8 cup white flour. This was absolutely perfect. I made it for my hisband's birthday and everyone loved it. If you are looking for a rhubarb cake recipe, look no further.

This was such a good dessert!  I cut the sugar in half, did not add the coconut or almonds, and I did not put any of the crumble topping on the cake.  I served the cake to my family, topped with a dollop of lite whipped topping.  It was a hit with everýone and calories were kept under control!
Will definitely bake this again and again!

I made this cake with fresh rhubarb this season.  I took it to my office and it was a big hit.  I had many many compliments.  I didn't change anything and yes, I would make it again.

This was delicious. I added a box of strawberry jello for color mostly and reduced sugar by 1/2 cup. Also used extra coconut in the streusel topping. I would reduce sugar again by 1/4 cup if I make it again. Nicely moist cake.

I followed the recipe and made no changes. I think the only thing I might change when I make it again (which I will) is add a little more rhubarb. Otherwise, we loved it!

Sooo good! Very moist cake with a perfect balance of tart and sweet. I used 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 1/8 cup white flour. Increased rhubarb to about 3 cups. Baked for closer to 40 minutes to ensure centre was done. Definitely adding this recipe to my seasonal rhubarb recipe rotation!

My husband said it's the best cake he's ever eaten! I put 4 cups of rhubarb in it, and I didn't have any buttermilk, so I substituted with sour cream. It came out beautifully, moist, and according to the "rhubarb expert," completely delicious. His only suggestion is more rhubarb!

Absolutely delicious!! Will make again and again. Loved the addition of the almonds/coconut. Very moist cake, dense and flavorful. I made it with cream cheese frosting (instead of the streusel topping) for my birthday and it received rave reviews. Also used 2-3 cups of rhubarb that had been in my freezer for a few months. Very happy to have found this recipe.
