Gruntag - this was incredible! My husband caught a yellowtail off the coast of La Jolla and we had friends over to help us eat it all. Everyone raved about the recipe - the frizzled ginger was the ultimate topper. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Excellent.  Modified it by using Talapia instead, which worked great.  Served with jasmine rice to soak up the delicious sauce.  Will try it again. Thanks.

beautiful tasting, moist and tangy fish...a little bit extra work to prep the sauce and a little bit extra calorie-wise but abosolutely worth it for a treat!

This was FANTASTIC!!!!  I went out on a fishing trip with me and my buddies and caught a few of these yellowtails out there, so the combination of the freshness of the fish and the addition of a beautiful bottle of wine and a spectacular recipe, and you have a COMPLETE WIN!

Easy, quick and wonderfully full of flavor.  Great recipe, thanks Gruntag!

The sauce was quite good, but I'll use a less salty hollandaise.  I would increase the orange juice concentrate.  I'll probably also not strain out all the ginger.  Worth a second try.

I have no words to describe this dish except for the next 48. 

It is amazing. I recently filled my freezer with yellowtail after absolutely crushing it on the high seas so I needed some new recipes. Then I landed here. Magically. 

It tastes like super model angels in heaven humping on a cloud. Couldn't recommend this recipe more.
