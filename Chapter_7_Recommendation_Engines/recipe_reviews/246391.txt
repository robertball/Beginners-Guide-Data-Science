I had never boiled a corned beef before and didn't know what to expect. This turned out really good. I think the cook time is a little too long though if you want to be able to slice it. Mine was so tender (not exactly a bad thing) that it fell apart when trying to slice it. The beer is a must so don't skip it. The next time I make this I will let the broth cool, skim off the fat, and find another use for it. It would make a killer Reuben Soup.
