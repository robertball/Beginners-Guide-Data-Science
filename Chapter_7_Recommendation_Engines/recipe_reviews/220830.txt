I made this recipe pretty close to the original recipe.  I added the merlot earlier in the process..simmered in the skillet after browning the meat with the fresh garlic in order to reduce the wine well and get all those yummy brown bits from the pan.  Once reduced, I added the broth and then poured all of it over the rest of the ingredients.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  This recipe makes a very savory and delicious beef and vegetable soup.  It really is good, but calling it a "ragout" is misleading as it is much thinner than a stew.  Also, I was hoping it would showcase the morel mushrooms, but their unique flavor was lost in all the complex spicy favors.  Actually, after cooking for so many hours, you could not really tell them apart from the other ingredients.  Since I wanted this to be a ragout, not a soup, I made a roux and added it in at the end to thicken it up...it worked great.  I did serve this with rice as recommended, but thought it would also be good over garlic mashed potatoes, so I offered both with dinner.  A vote was taken and 6 of 6 preferred it over the mashed potatoes.  Next time, I will omit the potatoes in the ragout and serve over mashed potatoes, with the morels saut√©ed seperately and served on top.  Serving with crusty French bread to sop up rich sauce is a must!  Next time I will also omit most of the broth and maybe some of the tomato sauce as well.  Without altering, it is soup....a hearty, delicious soup. Good base recipe!

Made this last night. It was great! We had company coming and he requested soup or stew so I did a search of slow cooker recipes and found this. What sold me on trying this recipe was the fact that the author/contributor of this recipe is from Slidell, Louisiana. I know this means it must be deliciously spicy with a complex flavor. I was not disappointed! I doubled the recipe on everything except the broth, and I also added the whole bottle of wine - half at the beginning and the other half in the last couple of hours of cooking.  I had a lot of the flour/Tony's mixture left, so near the end of cooking, I added some sauce to the flour and stirred until the flour was well blended, then added it to the crock pot. This thickened things up a little. In tasting it from the crock pot while cooking, it had an almost bitter edge, but in eating it with rice - it tasted very different and melded perfectly. Very rich, spicy and filling. My guest had three helpings - looking embarrassed at the third trip but getting more anyway. Because I made so much, we are freezing part of it and will be eating the rest over the next few days. Thanks so much! Will make again.

We had three pounds of top sirloin that accidentally thawed. I know top sirloin isn't the norm for a ragout, but we needed to use the beef fast, and prepare something we could package for the deep freeze. This was a terrific easy recipe and the results were outstanding. Thanks, AllRecipe.com for making it so easy to adjust recipe size! Yes, as one reviewer stated it is more towards a soup in consistency, so we thickened a little it with Tony Chachery's instant roux. Served over rice as recommended makes for a wonderful tummy warming meal. With the six quarts we have now in the deep freeze we'll be enjoying this for a long time!

Decent flavor at best, somewhat bland. More of a soup than a stew.
