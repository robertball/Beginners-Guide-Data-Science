Even my five year old picky eater wanted to eat some of it! I had different ingrediants on hand, and something else in oven at different temperature.  So I used carrots, red onion, mushrooms and yellow squash (the zuchini type) and baked at 275 for about 45 minutes.. delicious! Will try other items similar, and at temperature as instructed.

Very good and easy. Whole family loved it. Wasn't sure about sweet potatoes this way, so i combined white potatoes with it too, just in case. The sweet potatoes were just excellent though. Super! With no butter or sugar even. Excellent side dish with any main meat course.

Very good! The sweet potatoes tasted great done this way. We also liked the white potatoes, parsnips, carrots and pearl onions. We will be enjoying this one often.

We were tired of the same old Sweet Potatoes for Christmas, so I made this.  It went over pretty good (for a group of people that object to change).  It was easy to make and very tasty.

Easy to make, but very average-tasting.  The sweet potatoes were the best part, so don't leave them out.

This is a great way to get your family to eat parsnip as it hard to tell which cube is parsnip and which is potato!  I used baby carrots and a little less onion and it was well received.  I did cook it for a little longer than it said and I found that 2 potatoes definately does not feed 6 people, so the recipe needs doubling.
