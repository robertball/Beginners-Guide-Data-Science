Very easy, but needs more KICK to it.  It is missing some spice. I added chili powder, cumin, oregano and it helped a bit.

Great recipe! I made it with ground turkey, which made it a little dry - I simply added some milk at the end to make it creamy. Thanks for the recipe!

Good quick and easy recipe. It was a hit! I spiced it up a bit by adding oregano, chili powder, onion powder, and garlic powder with the ground beef. I also added one zucchini diced, one can of whole tomatoes diced, two cups of water and then simmered for 10 extra minutes. It turned out amazing! I already have requests to make it again.

One of the reasons this recipe is "bland" is that authentic Hungarian Goulash contains paprica and lost of spices.  Try a search for that.

It was a nice & easy dish, but a little bland.  We also don't like as much pasta.  If I make it again, I will be cutting down on the amount of pasta suggested.

Very simple and easy to make, however if I were to make it again, I would add an extra 1/2 lb. of gr. beef, a little more garlic salt then usual.  I added an extra can of tomatoe soup because it seemed a little dry in the cooking process...tasted pretty good with it!  Might add a little spaghetti sauce in there (1/2 c. or so) and I might try spiral macaroni next time.  Thanks for the recipe!

DH loved this recipe.  It was really easy but I found it slightly bland.  I substituted julianned green beans (canned) instead of the corn and used pinto beans instead of kidney beans.  It was still tasty.  I'm going to add some fresh garlic next time.  I also let it sit on low for 10 minutes after I mixed in the noodles so they got more flavor from the meat mixture.  Overall - we will make it again!  Thanks.

Very bland. 
Had I read the recipe better I wouldn't have made it... it instructs you put put all the beans and corn in the mixture without draining it. Ew! I worked in kitchens for several years and never once would served beans without not only draining them but rinsing them as well.
This was quick, and easy, but so is a hot pocket. The hot pocket would taste better.

This was a pretty good meal.  My favorite part was that it was cheap and easy!  I added cumin, corriander, and chili powder as well as milk and ketchup to make it creamier and flavorful.

This was quick and easy - but I thought it could use a little more flavor. Maybe 
garlic?? Or try adding some Lowrey's while browning the ground beef. We will try
it again.

It was ok, a bit bland--I tried adding some other spices and that helped a little.

I tried this last night without the beans or corn and added green pepper. My family loved it. Thanks for the idea, I had no idea what to make last night and this helped.

I'm not a big goulash fan, but I was looking for something quick and hearty for dinner (while using what I had in the kitchen).  I changed the recipe for 3 servings and played around with the ingredients a little bit, and here's what I came up with...substituted dried onions for fresh, left out corn and beans, added 2 cloves fresh minced garlic & about 1/4 tsp garlic salt(I love garlic!), didn't have tomato soup so I used half can Rotel tomatoes & peppers, half cup tomato sauce, 1 tsp tomato boullion w/chicken flavoring, added one can green beans, about two tablespoons of fresh chopped parsley, about 1/4 tsp Hungarian paprika, 1/4 tsp chili powder, 1/4 tsp cumin,  1/4 tsp oregano, & 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper, salt & pepper to taste. After browning meat and adding ingredients, I simmered covered for 10 minutes.  I don't eat noodles, but I'll bet it would taste excellent over the egg noodles suggested in the recipe. I would recommend this recipe to anyone, especially if you are willing to add your own special touch. Hope you try it and enjoy!

I had to add a can of tomato sauce.  I will either try black beans next time or leave the beans out.  Pretty good though.

It was very easy,fast, and filling.  DH liked it, but I thought it was pretty bland, and didn't have enough sauce.  I might try it again, but I'd definitely add some spaghetti or tomato sauce, and maybe some chopped green peppers.

Bland, bland, bland.  I used frozen peas and corn for my veggies, and subbed ground turkey since we don't eat beef, but this dish was not great.  I quadrupled the spices, even used fresh garlic, and added some cayenne for spice and dry mustard, but no matter what I did it just tasted flat.  It was easy to make, but I would rather take the time to make something we actually enjoy eating.

Quick and easy, but Hubby and I found it only fair. Relatively bland, and somewhat dry, but VERY filling! Leftovers reheated well, but were drier than the first night. Next time I would add more sauce, and move everything into a bigger pot (my largest skillet was over flowing!). Also, make sure you allow the ingredients to heat through at the end. Recipe doesn't tell you to do it, but if you don't the corn and beans will be cold. I'd advise allowing to simmer, covered for 3 or more minutes before adding hot noodles. Next recipe from this person should have more specific directions (i.e.: should you drain and wash the canned beans?).

I combined this recipe with the Goulash Supreme recipe on this site.  I didn't use corn or tomato soup (personal preference); that's where the other recipe came in.  This is very hearty and filling.  The kidney beans make it a little like chili.  My mom doesn't make it that way, but I find that it is a good flavor and texture addition.  This seems like a pretty flexible dish, and great for making a big batch and freezing for lunches.

Maybe it would have been better if the corn and beans were left out. A toddler visiting could not get enough of it.

This turned out out great! I did make some changes. I used lima beans that I pre-cooked for an hour. I also used frozen mixed veggies (carrots, peas, green beans, peas). Instead of serving with noodles, I served it with brown rice. I also substituted the ground beef for boiled chicken breast to make it a bit healthier. We will try it with whole grain noodles next time.

Fairly decent base recipe, but a bit bland. Customized to our taste by adding 1/2lb more beef, an extra can of soup, 1 diced zucchini, 1 diced summer squash, 1 can diced fire roasted tomatoes(drained) and 1tbsp minced garlic Also added paprika, oregano and a bit of chili powder. Pretty good after the changes, especially when low on time...

This is a great, simple recipe. I used stewed tomatoes instead of tomato soup because it's what I had on hand. I also boiled a beef bouillion cube in a cup of water and simmered all of the ingredients for another 10 minutes. My family really liked it!

My mom has been making this dish forever and she name it after my brother:  Eric's favorite casserole (He's in his late 40's now!).  She doesn't add the beans or the garlic salt but will also add an extra can of soup if it seems a little dry.  Then she bakes it for an hour at 325 deg., covered.

This is a really great recipe for goulash. It adds some new twists to an old dish and has a lot of flavor. I substituted the garlic salt with onion salt and garlic powder (because I didn't have garlic salt on hand) and it turned out great.

I took some of the other reviewers' advice and added some spices, tomato paste and even some milk.  Unfortunately, I still didn't find this dish to be very good.  My toddler son didn't like it at all.  I've never eaten Hamburger Helper but it seems like it would be tastier and easier than this recipe.
