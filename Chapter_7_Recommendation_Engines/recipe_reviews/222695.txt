Excellent summer meal or a great appetizer for those summer parties.  I made this is a gallon sized glass jar to transport to a party.  I tossed all the ingredients into the jar as I was prepping them except the avocado - added the Clamato juice and then at the party poured the whole thing into a large bowl, added the avocado and served in clear plastic disposable glasses.  There were absolutely no left overs.  Perfect!

This is great. I followed through with everything except for adding crab meat and my grandma told me to add just a tbsp of soy sauce. All in all, it's really delish. My dumb  forgot to peel my shrimp but everyone at the party didn't mind because the taste sure made up for it!

I found this and knew instantly it would be a success! Really easy to make.  Altho it is alot of knife work. We love it served with tostadas and also some black bean dip.
