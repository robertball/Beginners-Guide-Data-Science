It is DELICIOUS!  Seriously, don't bother trying out other recipes...this is the only one you need!  The only thing I do different is I sprinkle granulated sugar over the pie crust before baking.  YUM!

This pie knocks it out of the park, it's simple list of ingredients is the key.  Follow just as written!  I have never liked anything with rhubarb in it until I tried this recipe for my rhubarb-loving husband.  Fresh lemon juice is a must, I squeezed a whole lemon's worth.  I also glazed the crust in an egg yolk wash and dusted with white sugar before baking.  I added this one to our families favorite book of recipes.  Will remake this one again and again for sure.  Thank you, Chelsea, for the great share.

Great pie, great flavor with an ideal balance of rhubarb and strawberries.  I also loved that it wasn't complicated by unnecessary, even distracting, spices. Still, after making this I found that a) it could have used 1-2 T. more tapioca and b) I prefer using flour in my strawberry-rhubarb pies. For the crust, I used the beautiful "Perfect Pie Crust II," also from this site.

Have never eaten or made Strawberry Rhubarb Pie before, this recipe will become a favorite.  Didn't have the tapioca so substituted 1/3 cup cornstarch and followed recipe.  Easy, fast and delicious.

Delicious, succulent, with the clear juicy flavors of strawberry and rhubarb.  I like that this recipe is the simplest of these pies.  I skipped the lemon juice because it seemed plenty tart to me - but maybe this is for color.  In any case it was so simple and came out beautifully.  I used 'French Pastry Pie Crust' and topped it with a simple crumb topping of 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup flour.  Perfect summer pie!

I tried this recipe exactly as stated and I found it to be too runny and there was too much of a jelly texture to it.  After my ingredients sat for 15 minutes as directed, there was a lot of liquid in the bottom of my bowl.  The juices ran all over the baking sheet even though I left a bunch of liquid in the bowl after scooping out the pie filling.  I used 3T of lemonjuice since I didn't have a fresh lemon and I'm not sure if this contributed to the runny problem.  The tapioca gave it a very jelly like texture which I didn't really like very much.  I don't think I'll try this recipe again.

Great recipe!
I added a tsp of fresh grated orange zest. I also brushed the crust with an egg wash (1 egg yolk+1t. of heavy cream) for a beautiful golden brown matte finish!
Saving this recipe and going to make it next weekend after I pick up a lot more rhubarb from the farmers market!

This was delicious! The viscosity was perfect for me: just a little runnier than usual, with a vibrant blend of colors. The pie held together well, and the proportions were perfect--no boiling over.

I used this recipe to make my first strawberry rhubarb pies and they turned out wonderful. I took both pies to separate events and  everyone raved about them. Will definitely save this recipe to use again. Easy and excellent results.

Very solid recipe!  Bright flavor especially with my vodka pie crust (Thanks to Cook's Illustrated!).  I did pre-cook 3/4 of the filling with the tapioca to help off-set the "runny" quality that many have mentioned about this pie.  It helped greatly.

I have made this pie for my family three times this spring and it has disappeared within 24 hours every time. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Perfect combination of tart and sweet.

Chelsea, this pie is absolutely delicious.  My husband said the best pie he had eaten.  I have baked four so far, in the last month.  My question is, if I set it on a cookie sheet in the glass pie plate, it seems the bottom crust does not get as done as it should.  I did try the oven liner on the bottom rack under the pie.  Any suggestions.  Thanks for the recipe.  It is a winner.

Yummy! This was my 1st year harvesting rhubarb from our garden, and I was looking for a simple recipe. Used store bought frozen crust, and followed recipe to a T. Turned out terrific. Thank you! I plan to make this again for my DH to bring in to work.

Good recipe! Made it for my husband and mother-in-law who had never had rhubarb pie before, and it was a success. Very easy.

This is actually the "Favorite Strawberry Rhubarb Pie" recipe on the back of the instant tapioca box I bought. However, the other recipe calls for 1 cup less of each fruit (I still used 3 c strawberries but had only 2c rhubarb anyway) with the same amount of tapioca, so if you use all 6 cups of fruit as called for here, it might be too much filling and may be somewhat less congealed. 5c fruit total seemed to be a perfect amount for my pie.

Fabulous! The best strawberry pie I've ever had!
I followed the recipe pretty closely as written, with a few exceptions:

I substituted:
-- margine for the butter,
-- Granny Smith apple + 2 Tbs. flour in place of 1 cup of the rhubarb (I was short that cup, so the apple was a good compensation)
--Also, I baked this as an open-top, rather than a covered pie.

My husband and I loved it, and I will be sure to bake this again, esp. for parties!

This is a delicious recipe.  I never made a strawberry rhubarb pie before and had never tasted one.  We had planted rhubarb and had enough cut but not enough to make just a rhubarb pie.  So made this and it is excellent.  Is now at the top of our favorite pie list!!

This pie was pretty good. I used only 1/2 c of sugar and I thought it was plenty sweet and next time I will use 1 Tbs of cornstarch instead of tapioca.  I love how simple it is to make and that the ingredient list is so short.

Love this recipe! I do 2 cups each of strawberry, rhubarb and blueberry. I also use less sugar and a pinch less tapioca. 

Definitely a family favorite.

Delicious recipe! I'd forgotten how tart rhubarb can be and wanted to cut the sugar by 1/2 cup. Don't do this! Believe me, you want the sweet to meld with the tart. I'd definitely make this pie again.

Yes it was too runny, but flavor was on point. I used the crust recipe from the Moosewood Cookbook. Also used a crumble topping from the Moosewood Cookbook, strawberry rhubarb crumble recipe. I followed this recipe as written for the filling, except I added a couple hand fulls of coconut flakes. I liked how simple the ingredient list was, but next time I will tweek it to control the runniness.

Great recipe my husband loves it. I substituted cornstarch for the tapioca and started everything on the top of stove just til it started to thicken. I also used a lattice crust. Will definitely make this again!!

This recipe will not disappoint. I've enjoyed a variety of strawberry rhubarb pies over the years, but I haven't tasted a good homemade recipe since my Dad's and that's been almost 40yrs. This reminded me of his recipe and that was absolutely delicious.

Flavor was good but it was very runny.  I’d use less sugar and add flour instead of tapioca. It didn’t thicken at all.

Tasted great but a big sopping mess 
Way too much liquid and i did not put all the mixture liquid in.
Also spilled over  the cookie sheet under it in the oven so I get to clean my oven as well.
Ended up serving  it as a crumble 
Very disappointing

I haven't had strawberry rhubarb pie in ages and decided to give this version of the recipe a try...LOVED IT!!! This one will be going in my recipe book :) I used a deep dish pie pan so I upped the cups of strawberries to 4 cups and added a tab bit more tapioca came out fantastic!!

My daughter made this and it has to be one of the best pies I have ever tasted. We enjoyed it so much. We used strawberries that we picked from a strawberry farm - can't beat the taste of those compared to store bought. Will definitely use this recipe again.

Fabulous pie!  Fresh, with wonderful sweet and tart flavors coming together in the juicy filling.  I found the tapioca easy to find, easy to use, and binds the pie filling nicely.  I did use the crumb crust that DairyGodmother suggested and it was awesome.  I plan to make my pies like that all the time (especially since I'm not so great with 2-crust pies!!).

I've been using this recipe for a few years and its a family favorite! I only use 1 stalk worth of rhubarb so the flavor isnt too overpowering. I'll still be making this pie 20 yrs from now, it's totally a keeper. Try it!

Simple and delicious.  I was shocked at the response I got on Facebook when I announced I was making this pie!  It was either "I want a piece, it's my favorite", or "I've never tasted it!"  I have to buy more rhubarb plants, one can't grow fast enough for the demand I'm getting!

This was wonderful! Tasted just like my moms... it was a little runny, but then, so was hers! The next day it was much better. I think next time I will add a few addl TBSP of tapioca and see if it helps. Excellent  pie! Thanks for sharing!
