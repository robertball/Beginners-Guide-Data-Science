The flavors mix wonderfully.  As I searched the various pineapple upside down cakes I picked this one because the ingredients were slightly different and the cake looked like fun to make.  I was not disappointed. 

 I do think for color that the addition of cherries in the middle of the pineapples would have helped its appearance.

The instructions were easy to follow, and considering I don't do much cooking, much less cakes I was estactic with the results.

This was good, but turned out a little dry.  Next time I will add more pinnapple and some applesauce.

I really liked this version of pinapple upside-down cake. However, it was more reminiscent of fruit cake then the classic pineapple upside-down cake to me. The dark rum was a bit strong for my taste so I flipped the cake over, put it back in the oven and cooked more of it off then it was perfect. I would definitely make this again!

Ridiculously delicious. Pineapple upside down cake is my very favorite kind of cake...I've eaten half a pan before, and this cake I probably shouldn't make very often because I could forsee that happening. I made this on a Tuesday for a Thursday birthday so I added a little extra pineapple juice and buttermilk, as well as maybe 3/4 c applesauce and the cake couldn't have been more moist. I used cherries instead of the currants but otherwise kept everything else the same. I'm not sure if I liked the almonds, but the cake was fantastic regardless.

Because this was different from the other PU cakes I gave it a try. After it cooled it settled to about half an inch high. It was way too wet. I followed the original recipe to the letter. So I don't think it was user error. No one will eat it so now a more traditional cake is baking in my oven. I hope you have better luck if you try this one.

This was a spice cake Pineapple upside down cake .While the topping was very good - the cake was a bit dry but flavorful. If you are looking for the usual moisty regular cake this will be a disappointment - if you want different, you might like this however needs moistness.

Good taste but didn't yield very much cake. Kind of a waste of time. Tasted like a pineapple topped ham

Made by recipe (no changes). Did not care for this cake.  Cake was too thin.   Should have been called Pineapple Spice Cake. I personally did not favor this combination.  Did not think the spice flavor would have been so strong.
