I love making my own salad dressing and this is one of my favorites. People ask me for the recipe whenever I make it. I omit the kiwi and orange and usually, add corn. I only use maybe a quarter of the dressing on the salad. I don't like salad swimming in dressing, but I save the rest and use on other salads or give it away to a guest so they can enjoy it. This is really a nice sweet and tangy dressing that works well with a lot of different salads.

This was a big hit at our Easter Dinner this year! 

The salad is really easy to make -

I think the dressing is wonderful and it really makes the salad a success! you can pour as much on or as little of the dressing on as you want! 

I will definitely make this again!

Very Good!  Perhaps too much dressing but otherwise a big hit

Excellent!!  Made it for the mother-in-law for Mothers Day.....big hit.  The only alteration I made was leaving out the kiwi and I found the directions made way too much dressing so you can probably cut in half.  Will certainly make again.

I love to make unique salads that are a "taste sensation" and all the ingredients with the dressing come together to make a fabulous tasting salad.  I will be adding this to my repertoire of summer/brunch salads.

This salad was alright.  I did not really care for the bacon in it; I thought it gave it a little bit of a funny taste.  Other than that, the combination of flavors was excellent.  I love fruit in salads and the tangy dressing really complimented the sweetness of the fruit.  I served this for Easter dinner and everyone seemed to enjoy it even though it was different than our usual salad.  I would make it again, but I think next time I am going to add some nuts, possibly candied walnuts or almonds, and omit the bacon.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for dinner last night, added rotisserie chicken.  My husband loved it so much, he must have complimented me 10 times.  Definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

This salad was delicious!!  Absolutely the best salad I have made, hands down. I made it for a family gathering and everybody thought it was wonderful.  My husband even commented on how this was the best salad I have made.  And he loved the dressing.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Instead of the mushrooms, kiwi and mandarin oranges, I added fresh pineapple.  Also used dijon mustard instead of brown, and slightly increased the dressing ingredients in proportion to the olive oil as it seemed too 'oily'.  I will definitely keep playing with this recipe!

This was an excellent recipe loved by all! The only change I would do is less dressing or more spinach!! Don't pour the whole amount on the salad like I did toss in between!!

This salad was delicious.  The dressing was sweet and tangy and very easy to make.  The only change I made was that I substituted a small sunkist orange for the mandarin orange.  Add dressing to taste.

This was a fantastic salad. I made it for a get-together, and was surprised that the salad did shine amidst all the wonderful menu items (included honey grilled salmon and steak!) 
Will definitely make again!

After reading through the recipe and the reviews, I was expecting to love this salad.  However, the reaction from myself and two guests was "meh."  We all agreed that we liked each individual ingredient, but they didn't seem to meld together very well.  And leftovers were enjoyed more with bottled ranch dressing than with the homemade dressing.  I'm rating this a 3, but it was actually more of a 2 1/2.  I won't be making this again.

This is a lovely salad that I took to a dinner party.  Everyone raved!  Last night I made it again, leaving out the egg and strawberry and using mixed greens and it was just as wonderful!  Great recipe!!!  Thanks for sharing!

I have to admit that I was skeptical trying the dressing to this salad.  But, I was pleasantly surprised!  The salad was great and our guests loved it.

I was short on ingredients so I had to use Balsamic vinegar and Dijon mustard. It still tasted fine. The salad was devoured so the family must have liked it too.

Tasted great!  Like others recommended, I would cut back on the dressing so the salad is not drowning, but it was tasty!

I only used the dressing for a different salad! Turned out delicious! I'll definitely be making the whole recipe as written in the near future!
