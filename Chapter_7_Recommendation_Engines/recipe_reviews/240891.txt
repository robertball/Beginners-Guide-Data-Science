This was yummy--I'll be making it again. My daughter and I had it for breakfast. I only put 4 T sugar since I spread Nutella on top, and it was just right. Mine took exactly 2 minutes and was moist but not overly moist. I love that it uses whole wheat flour, and it tasted so good.

This is a really good cake! I cooked this cake in one large soup mug and topped it with chocolate frosting. I really dislike microwave cakes that contain eggs as it makes tro consistency rubbery and since this recipe doesn't call for eggs the cake turned out beautifully moist!

I used coconut flour, coconut oil, & almond milk (it's what I had...).  Came out pretty tasty! But I agree, need to cut back on the sugar!!

This was tasty, and very simple to throw together, too! I did not have any Nutella on hand, so I just sprinkled the top w/ mini chocolate chips. I just had a bite to taste it, but the kids devoured it, so that makes this a keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was really good! I was craving something sweet, I typed in these ingredients and this recipe came up. This was quick and easy! Next time I will use a little less sugar because the banana added to the sweetness.

Used no sugar but 2 teaspoons of honey. Used lemon not vanilla extract. Used vanilla creamer not milk. Used peanut butter spreads on top not Nutella.

Wonderfully moist & delicious.  I added peanut butter and chocolate pieces directly to the mix.  Also replaced sugar with dried dates and Yacon syrup (total of 3T).  (We all know the rule to follow recipes precisely 1st time, then adjust to our specific preferences.)

Will absolutely make again - it was quick, easy & hit the spot.  I used unsweetened almond milk, only 1 tbsp of vegetable oil, 1 tbsp coconut sugar with 1 tbsp of brown sugar, also added a couple dashes of cinnamon in the batter - I couldnâ€™t find chocolate chips in the kitchen so I used almond slivers, oh and three minutes in the microwave left it cooked and moist as anything

This was absolutely delicious! The only changes I made was I used almond milk instead of regular,  and since I have had very negative experiences with microwave cakes that didn't rise without the use of eggs, I added  just a small bit of extra baking powder before cooking it. The only catch was I had to microwave it for an extra minute; even after adding the extra baking powder it took longer to rise and actually cook. Great recipe, though!

Taste is awesome and it's a really easy, convenient recipe, but the texture is a bit sticky. Maybe I didn't microwave it quite long enough, but I did make it twice. I modified it once with brown sugar instead of white, which I liked.

This is delicious!  It does make enough for two.  Added a few chocolate chips, a few chopped walnuts and a tiny pinch of salt.

I had some bananas that were ripening fast and no eggs so I was looking for a simple recipe to fit.  This did the trick. Very easy to make and the cake was moist and tasty. I used a whole banana, although fairly small, and only four T of sugar; still found it a bit sweet so I'll try with 3 T sugar next time. I also split the recipe in two for cooking, half in a large glass mug and half in a 300 ml pyrex bowl.  Turned out very well for individual servings.

First mug cake I've made. Quick, easy, decent texture. I added mini chocolate chips to the mix since didn't have Nutella. Picky husband thought it was pretty good. Would make again for fast dessert. Cooked for 2min 15sec.

I made mine with gluten-free flour and Stevia and it tasted fine it's just a little spongy in texture definitely still  a treat though.
