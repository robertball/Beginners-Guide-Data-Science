Footnote to recipe: Using 90% lean 10% fat ground beef or ground turkey is recommended.  To double the fat “off” during baking, the meatballs lose inner fat by dripping it to the bottom of the little muffin cup it is baking in.  *** T he meatball is never resting in its fat*** This process results in a 5% less meat fat content.  Wait 5 minutes after baking to use a large soup spoon to lift the meatball out. Place onto a hotplate or on top of pasta or pasta sauce, gravy, etc.   The fats left in the muffin tins can be poured out.  The muffin tin is immediately ready for second batch.  It is not necessary to cool it first, but take care when handling as usual.
