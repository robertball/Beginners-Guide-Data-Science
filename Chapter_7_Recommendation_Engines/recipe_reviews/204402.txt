I am in LOVE with this sauce and frequent the restuarant that it is served at, just for this sauce. Now I can finally make it at home! Upon first taste it tasted a little heavy on the ginger, but letting it sit for about 20 minutes in the fridge made all the flavors meld. LOVE IT! Thanks so much, my search is over. Try it, you won't like steak without it after trying it!

I am sorry but I just didn't care for this sauce as written.  I found that, for me, it was very strongly tahini flavoured and a bit gritty in texture.  But, I kept adding quite a bit of mayonnaise, about 1 tsp sesame oil, more garlic, and about 1 Tbsp very finely minced fresh ginger.  So, in the end, I am afraid I completely changed the recipe but made it more appropriate for our tastes. I used it as a dip for toasted ravioli which is also on this site, and it was a nice compliment. Thank you, Laurieloo for posting this recipe.

While this sauce is similar in consistency to what is served in the aforementioned restaurants it isn't accurate.  There is no mayonnaise in the actual sauce but it is made in a similar way to mayo (ie it's an emulsion).

I was disappointed. I lived ia alberta for 25 years and had fun trying to guess which restaurant this is from. My guess is "The Keg" but I have been gone for a long time so who knows, there coukd be a whole new chain I don't know about!! As far as this recipe, I didn't like it. I did add sugar and a little balsamic vinegar which helped. Te each their own taste I guess.

Thanks so much for this recipe.  I tried to replicate this sauce several years ago and it was a complete disaster.  This one worked great. 

 I made only a couple of adjustments. I didn't have any paprika, so I left it out.  I used fresh minced ginger and garlic from jars, a teaspoon of each.  Be careful with the water, I didn't need to add much.

This was pretty good but it received 3 stars from me due to the very strong ginger taste.  Next time I'll try cutting the ginger quantity in half.

This was very yummy! I am often accused of liking "weird" stuff and this meets my standard very deliciously!  Use a stick blender for super-fast mixing.

A little bit of messing around with ingrediants to get just the right flavour, but sooo worth it.  Would definately put less ginger, maybe only 1 tsp.

This is a good starting base. It does need some tweaking although. Luckily you can buy the sawmill sesame steak sauce at Safeways and Sobeys across Canada, but for some we need it wheat free. As I sit here with a bottle of sawmill sesame steak sauce the ingredients are oil, soy sauce, egg yolk, water, garlic, onion and sesame paste but no ginger. Using tahini and mayonnaise makes the most sense and the easiest way. It definitely needs some raw onion blended in and more mayo than the recipe suggests. Also the type of soy sauce will make a huge difference. This sauce needs a Japanese soy sauce which is lighter than Chinese soy sauce. I recommend kikkoman (wheat free for those who need it) not China lily or VH. Then add water to taste and then I think you will have a pretty good sesame sauce!! Add or leave out the ginger for your taste as it is not necessary

I have been trying to find a recipe similar to Japanese Village Sesame Sauce for years. This is it! It likely isn't the same ingredients, but it tastes exactly the same to me. I didn't even know what Tahini was when I came across this recipe. All I knew is that I didn't have time to roast my own sesame seeds. This recipe is so easy.
I love it and have been putting the sauce on everything: steak, chicken, rice, etc. So delicious. Thank you!

I thought this was a good base for a tahini sauce but missing some really key flavors. It has the bitter/salty/spicy going for it, but needed to be balanced out. We really liked it after making a few adjustments: Half the amount of soy sauce, subbing Bragg's liquid aminos, using only 1/2 t. ginger, adding 1 T. minced parsley, 1 T. honey, and 1 t. lemon juice.

I guess this is a new sauce recipe though, so maybe I'm missing something with what to serve the original with. I served the sauce with seared t-bone steaks.

very good, but definately have to cut the ginger in half, also i substituted the tahini for toasted ground seasame seeds, in my opinion, a much better tase and not as strong, can be used with anything

It wasnt as sweet at the restaurant,  also much darker, so I added some extra mayo and a dash of brown sugar. It's alright, I'll still probably  order from the restaurant  again.

Excellent base recipe. I made it as written but then added extra mayo. I think I may lower the soya sauce and up the garlic and ginger. Delicious overall!

Good starter. Added 1 more teaspoon of soy sauce (might be because we had light soy sauce vs dark), added 1 teaspoon of sugar, added a little bit of sesame oil. I just chopped the garlic but garlic press would have been better. And maybe next time make it a bit ahead so it can marinate longer.

Always wondered what the main flavour profile was in our favorite restaurant yum yum sauce. Tahini! Who knew, made this recipe adjusting water for preferred thickness. It's not an exact copy cat recipe but close; love it on rice, thanks for the recipe.

I've just made this recipe, almost to the letter, I did as one reviewer suggested and used already minced garlic & ginger as it was what I had on hand. However, it's an odd taste and nothing like the sesame steak sauce I've been buying in Sobeys (my local grocery store). I'm addicted to that sauce lol. I had hoped to replicate it somewhat. Oh well, you gave it a good try labuanlady :-). I guess I will keep looking and until I find something, will have to keep buying the sauce by the case lol!  Thank you again for sharing this recipe.

This is nothing like the sauce from the "Alberta restaurant" I'm thinking of, which was the sawmill steak house. It had a strong flavor of soy sauce, and no where near as much sesame as the original. Also, it was much less creamy. I made it with equal parts tahini and mayo(light),added a teaspoon of sesame oil, reduced the ginger to a teaspoon, and doubled the water. It's not exact, but its darn close!

I am not familiar with the restaurant sauce that this recipe is supposed to imitate, but we did like this with our steaks.  I made it as written with a bit of extra garlic and paprika.
