This was excellent over ice cream, although a bit bland. I may up the orange zest next time. I also used it as a sauce over a lemon sponge pie, and for that, it wasn't quite sweet enough. If you're using this over something other than ice cream, you may want to use a little more sugar.

This was soooo good!  The only changes I made were to up the fruit amount to 9 cups (our freezer broke and we had to get rid of stuff), so I also upped the zest amount to 1 Tbs to use the entire orange, but kept the juice to 1/4 cup.  I loved every bite and it goes so well on vanilla ice cream!  I look forward to using it on oatmeal!

I served this at room temperature over vanilla ice cream - it was delicious & everyone loved it!  Great flavor!  I juiced the orange I used for the zest & used that instead of packaged OJ.  My only problem was that I couldn't get it to thicken, but it didn't matter for the way I was serving it.  Can't wait to make it again!

Love this simple recipe!  I didn't change the ingredients but I cooked this on the stovetop instead.  It earned rave reviews and I served over pound cake.

Absolutely delicious!  I halved the recipe because I only had 3 cups of frozen dark cherries on hand.  Threw in a few fresh strawberries to use them up.  So simple to put together.  Highly recommend.  Use a nice, juicy orange!

This was delicious over vanilla bean ice cream. The only issue I had with it was the final step with the cornstarch, which could well be an issue with my slow cooker, but it never got hot enough to activate the corn starch and thicken. I ended up dumping it all into a pot and bringing it to a low boil on the stove.

Really liked this recipe! Followed it exactly. It came out really well. Would recommend letting it sit in the slow cooker (slow cooker off, after cooking) for 30 minutes or so to finish thickening.

Made this twice now. Quick and easy, great with vanilla bean ice cream.
