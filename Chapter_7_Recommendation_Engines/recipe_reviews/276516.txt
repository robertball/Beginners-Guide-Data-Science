Great, light, healthy recipe! I used quinoa instead of brown rice. Loved it!

This sounds unusual and delicious.  I haven't made this yet, but am wondering about the rice.  Does it really get done?  Am I wrong in assuming it is put into the stuffing uncooked?

I didnâ€™t really care for the walnuts in it.
