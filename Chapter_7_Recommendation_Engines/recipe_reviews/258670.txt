I’ve been told, but have not confirmed, that this is the recipe O’Charleys uses when making their famous Caramel Pie. I’m going to try it out this afternoon by doing as follows..... transform the sweetened condensed milk into the caramel luxury and when cooled empty into a graham cracker crust (actually I’m going to use two cans-one may not be enough!). I’ll top with a generous amount of heavily whipped cream and  bittersweet dark chocolate shavings. Nut lovers can sprinkle toasted walnuts or pecans; either would work nicely! Refrigerate and indulge!

Love this! I've heard of this before but wasn't sure how it was done. This is amazingly simple, and the flavor is incredible. 

i covered the can completely with water and put it on it's side because I couldn't stop hearing, "NEVER heat a closed system." The reason is that pressure builds in the can as it's heated. The can is strong enough for the little pressure thats built, but I would never want to use a weakened can.

It tastes wonderful. I covered the can completely in water only because i added to much water to the  pan. 

I let it cook for about 3.75 hrs  and it has a rich caramel color. I did add a bit of vanilla to it after it cooled. 

I'm going  try using it to sweeten my coffee and try it on ice cream.

I used to make this in the 50's.   But this time someone opened a can (to add to chocolate milk, which should have been evaporated milk) and I'd like to know if I can do it in  perhaps a double boiler??  Can anyone  report success with this?
Thank you

My mother used to make dulce de leche exactly like this.  It's delicious...i remember waiting and waiting and waiting for it to be done...it was always worth it.
