I thought this was a wonderful dish.  It needs to be served hot - right out of the oven in order to fully appreciate the creamy sauce.

Good, but very greasy. I prefer "Moms Yummy Onion Casserole" on this site.

I made this dish to serve with our Thanksgiving Dinner, and it was great.  Very easy to make.  I sauted the onions early and finished the dish later.  Sprinkled with paprika and parsley for color, it was a big hit.  Thank you.

This was so good!  My husband and I love onions, and this really hit the spot!  I think next time I will add some thick hickory smoked bacon pieces.  Mmmmmm!

This was totally easy to put together. My husband and I are cheese and onion lovers. This is our new (replate the boring green beans) favorite recipe for the holidays.

This was good, but makes way more than 7 servings. You only need a small spoonful. I might make it again.

I served as a side dish at Thanksgiving, looking for something to make that I already had ingredients for.  I added garlic, wine, bacon, mushrooms and some mozzarella to the onion mixture as well as parm on top. I substituted milk and flour for the cream.  It was a hit!

I don't know if I did something wrong or what, but this was not very good for us. It was messy and just didn't look appetizing at all. It smelled wonderful, but we ended up throwing it out. May try again to see if we get the same results, because everyone else seems to enjoy it.

This was a pretty good recipe, but a little too much onion for me in one sitting.  I found it goes extremely well as a "topper" for something else like baked potatoes. It already has all the butter you need and makes baked potatoes a special treat instead of the same old boring potato.

What a great recipe - quick and easy too!!!  Also a great presentation for company.  I followed directions exactly except for sprinking paprika on the top for color.  This was my first try so I scaled it to 4 for just the 2 of us and we finished it up.  I agree with another reviewer who suggests serving it immediately.

I've been trying out different veggie side-dishes to serve with Christmas dinner; this won't be putting in appearance, I'm afraid. This was really bland, and not nearly cheesy enough for cheese freaks like us. I doubt I'll make it again.

I added some chopped garlic near the end of sautéing the onions. Very good tasting but I might make again and add mushrooms, bacon. I thought it tasted better warm rather than room temp.
