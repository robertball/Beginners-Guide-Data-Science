Mm-mmmm good! Simple with subtle flavor just what I was after for the fish I served it with. And because I served it with fish I used chicken broth rather than the beef consomm√© and added some green peas at the end for color. Also because I made such a small portion of this I did not follow the baking instructions preferring the conventional stove-top method instead. I loved the addition of the sliced almonds which made this particularly interesting.

REALLY GOOD! Unbelievably I didn't have any carrots on hand so in the interest of adding something orange I chopped up about 1/2 cup of orange bell pepper instead. Omitted the 1/2 tsp salt as the consomme is loaded with sodium already. Also to save time and washing I used an oven-proof skillet and did everything in one pan. It was so good! My husband likened it to Chinese fried rice "but much better lighter and not greasy." Next time I will add more almonds for more crunch and flavor. I served this with grilled chicken breasts with a ranch-mustard sauce. Thanks kbalbi for a delicious recipe!

Loved it! It tasted good as well as being easy to make. I chopped the veggies the night before and put them into separate small zipper type bags. The next day I put it all together. Easy! I liked baking it rather than having to cook it on the stove top. I can't imagine it turning out any more perfect than it did. I wish I'd thought to take a photo of it. Will be making it again for sure!

I made this for my wife because she asked for some rice to have with her salmon. This is a winner. I will save this recipe and make it for this upcoming Thanksgiving. I did add green peas corn and used chicken stock as one other reviewer commented. I also substituted chopped pecans instead of almonds. A keeper.

I really like this dish. Actually I let out the almonds. You could a use chicken broth if you were making it with chicken. It's versatile and you can use whatever veggies you have on hand.

We really liked it. I used chicken bouillon instead of beef. It seemed a bit dry towards the end so I added 1 more cup of bouillon. Did the trick. My mother in law couldn't get enough!

Very good rice recipe. I did a few changes though but just because I do not eat red meat. I changed the beef consomme for chicken stock. Instead of butter I used Extra virgin Olive Oil. I added a dash of cayenne pepper and turmeric just because these are very good for your health. I threw everything (but the almonds) in a rice cooker and voila! Almonds went in at the end. It is a light recipe fresh in flavor but with a little crunchiness from the almonds and a little kick from the cayenne pepper. In the Caribbean we eat rice with avocado so if you have never tried this combination before go for it I promise you won't be disappointed. It was simply Delicious! my daughter couldn't stop talking about how good it was. Will definitely do it again.
