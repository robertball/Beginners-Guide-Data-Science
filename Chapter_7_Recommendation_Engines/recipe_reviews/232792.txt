I really like the method and the idea behind this recipe.  For me personally there is a little too much cinnamon, allspice and sugar in the french toast, but that is me - others may really like that. I forgot about the chives, they are called for in the ingredients but not in the instructions, I assume they were supposed to be used as a garnish.

Just terrific!  My husband, a huge fan of Eggs Benedict, was crazy about it, which surprised me a little, as he really enjoys  a ridiculous amount of Hollandaise sauce on "normal" Benedict.  This one's a keeper, and would be great for holiday guests,  The only change I made was to substitute good sliced Swiss for the Havarti.  Thanks for a great brunch, Chef John!

My daughter made this for my Mother's Day breakfast yesterday.  All I can say is WOW!!!!!  Due to the richness we only had one poached egg atop the delicious French toast, which was more than enough.  It was savory, sweet and delectable.  It was the perfect combination of my favorite sandwich, the Monte Cristo, and Eggs Benedict.  Even my six-yr old son liked it.  This recipe is now a keeper in our house.

I have made this twice, testing it before I serve it at a brunch for 50.  The first time I made it as written but without the allspice.  I thought the savory overpowered the sweet.  I guess I am looking for more of a monte cristo and less of a eggs benedict.  The second time I made it (again without the allspice and added a sprinkle of sugar to the batter) but didn't serve the poached eggs.  Instead I drizzled it with maple syrup.  The salty/sweet combo is perfect that way.  That is what I'll be serving at the big brunch!

This was good....ok really.  We ate every bite but I'm not sure I would make it again.  We didn't really particularly care for the way the flavors meshed.  It is so simple to make for a beautiful presentation and it could just be our palettes.  I encourage people to try it because the idea of it all is quite awesome.

Delicious! I made this for supper. I don’t have a sweet tooth so I omitted the sugar and reduced the allspice and cinnamon to just a dash each in the batter. The whipping cream is sweet enough without the need for additional sugar. I also omitted the salt from the batter because I didn’t see any reason for it when the ham is already salty.

This was excellent. The taste is indulgent and memorable, like one would associate with a holiday tradition. My children, 12 & 6, enjoyed this as much as I did. Thank you for sharing this with us.

If you are reading reviews to decide whether or not to make this, just make it already. I make this all the time. This is a fantastic breakfast. I have substituted the Cheddar for Smoked Gouda at times which I really enjoy. I have also just used the french toast as is and served it up with maple syrup. Everyone who tries this really likes it. I bought a egg poacher pot specifically for this recipe to help save time because I wind up making this for large groups.

made this for mothers day breakfast and it was a hit. The only difference was I fried the egg over medium. This will be a regular in our kitchen. 
Thanks Chef John

Very tasty! I made several tweaks however. I decide to eliminate the sweet factor in the end and replaced the sugar with several spices I use for breakfast eggs, such as tarragon, garlic powder, paprika, and worcestershire sauce. I also added a couple slices of tomato once the cheese and ham were assembled. Turned out great!

Nasty review, Don when you didn't even make it!  I'm definitely going to make this, but since I'm not very good at poached eggs, I'll do over easy.

Didn't even try it. It's a typical Chef John recipe, if it doesn't have at least 10 ingredients it' not  up to his "standards"!

This recipe was very simple and tasted fantastic! It also taught me how to poach an egg; I overcooked it the first time, but then learned how to tell "by touch" when the egg was done. 

Thanks Chef!

Made this for Father's Day breakfast and it tasted better than my homemade Eggs Benedict which always gets rave reviews... So easy to make used muenster, Havarti, and Vermont extra sharp white cheddar... Made several and no leftovers :)

OH MY!! I made this for Fathers Day brunch with a side of fruit salad. It was a big hit in my house, my husband LOVED it. I was happy to find something different than the usual pancakes and eggs! I will make this again and not to mention LOVED that fact that I didnt have to "tweak" this recipe at all!

Great recipe and video tutorial! My hubby and I loved this (we are big Eggs Benedict fans) when I made it for breakfast yesterday. I followed the recipe exactly for the extra pinch of cayenne at the end (I forgot).  The trickiest part was poaching the eggs, but as long as I watched the pot it was fine.

I found the French toast too sweet to be combined with the ham/cheese/egg.  I ended up dis-assembling and eating that portion separate from the French toast.  I would make just the French toast portion again.

Made this for my girlfriend and I for a Sunday brunch. She and I are in agreement that we will never feel the need to eat out in order to get decent Benedict. Due to ingredients in the fridge, we had to do a little substituting but it was still well worth it. Half-and-half instead of heavy cream, Dave's Killer Bread instead of French, turkey instead of ham, and we even omitted the Havarti. I'm sure it's that much better with the actual suggested ingredients.

It definitely needed the usual Swiss cheese, and a slice of turkey, and as we eat them here in New England, a side of warm maple syrup  for dipping !

Followed recipe but omitted sugar (not necessary).  Very good and well received by my picky eater.  I did serve hollandaise on the side for my son who hates runny eggs.  Thanks for this unique take on Monte Cristo sandwiches, which always are overwhelming due to deep frying.

The only changes that I made were to use sharp cheddar cheese and to cut the bread on the diagonal. This was delicious and now have made it three times in a row. This will become a weekly dish at our home.  Thanks Chef John.

This recipe offers a wonderful combination of flavors; however, I’d cut back a smidgeon on the sugar the next time.   We had mixed reviews on this one, my husband thought it was a 5 star and I thought it was 4.  It’s definitely worth trying.

No one at breakfast raved about it, or even commented on it, so it wasn't just me who thought "meh, not terrible." It just wasn't as good as a benedict or as good as a Monte Cristo. Maybe I expected too much. Normally I tweak something and try again, but I'm just going to let this one be.

I will definitely make this again.  It went together easily, and presented wonderfully.  The family loved it.  I am not very good at poaching eggs, but I followed Chef John's video, and it helped.  Not beautiful (old eggs, I think), but perfectly cooked.  Next time they will LOOK beautiful as well!

I liked the mixture of flavors. I used Canadian bacon and upped the cayenne since we like a little more heat. Delicious!

Made this for a large group of boys leaving on a very early flight.  I thought the 30 minute bake time would give me a moment to check everyone's bags.  They liked it and thought it was good but there was definitely no WOW factor.  The general consensus was that it tasted like a breakfast sandwich with cheese on french toast.  Some wanted the eggs scrambled and under the meat and cheese so that it could be folded and eaten by hand.  I did make non-pork versions using beef bacon with the same results.  They all added syrup but they're teenagers so who knows.  Not sure why but it only took 18 minutes to bake.

This was a wonderful recipe. I actually made this as a breakfast in bed for my lady for Valentine's Day and she loved it. She actually loved it so much that she requested it for breakfast a couple days later. The first day I didn't have enough of the egg mixture to coat the 4th bread (Texas Toast), but that may have been because I left the first to absorb too much, I'm not certain. The second time, since there's just two of us, I cut the recipe in half and had enough mixture for both slices.

I substituted Chipotle Chile Powder for the Cayenne, just because I didn't have any on hand. I also omitted the chives and all-spice, again because I didn't have any. But I think the highlight of this was definitely the Havarti cheese which neither of us had ever tried prior to this recipe. The cheese is very creamy and buttery.

I just wanted to write in and say thank you to Chef John for this wonderful recipe.

I loved this recipe! Not too sweet. A Monte made into benedict? Awesome! The only thing I did differently is that I used the microwave method to do the poached eggs. Easy peezy! Thanks Chef!

I've made this twice, once with the cinnamon, allspice and sugar. It really wasn't what we liked.  Next time I made it without the sweetness and made it herbal with a French herbal blend and I used the same cheeses, my husband and I liked this better.

Surprisingly good and the family loved it.  When I first went over the recipe, it seemed like too much cheese.  But I stay true to the recipe as I do on all first attempts. 

I typically adjust all recipes to my own tastes after that, like a little more garlic a little more celery, but this one is spot on.  I am a big fan of Chef John since I tried the New Orleans food recipes.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a fried egg with runny yolks instead (faster).  It's SO GOOD.  These went over really big with my male-dominated household.  Prep and cooking is super fast.  It tastes like I spent much more time on these.  Enjoy!

Loved this recipe! The chives, ham, and cheese are a wonderful savory touch added with the sweetness of the french toast. I served it with sunny side up eggs instead of poached. The leftovers we reheated and and ate with Strawberry jam. Delicious!

Excellent recipe! Had to make more French toast batter for the 3rd and 4th pieces of bread. Next time I will make 1.5 times the batter.  Used turkey bacon instead of ham and sourdough instead of French bread. Really rich and delicious.

Great idea.... but with a couple tips.

Slice the bread on the thick side, and allow time for soaking in the liquid bath.  The key is allowing bread to become completely wet throughout.

I used panchetta instead of plain, sliced ham and liked the taste.

Prepare the perfect poached egg to ensure the yellow runs over the bread.

Finally, reduced cooking time by 5+ minutes.

Everyone was very happy.

This was really tasty, and I did not even have all the ingredients I needed. Used provolone cheese because I had no havarti and I did not put the egg on top, just made the sandwich.  Also I did not use all the sweet spices for the bread batter, was worried it would be too sweet and I wanted it to taste more like a meal and not a dessert.  Even with all those changes it was so good!  I will make this again for sure.

I have to give this 5 stars.  My husband and I both loved it.  Very easy to make.  Nice presentation.  I made exactly as written with the exception of the cheeses.  I used what I had on hand which was pepper jack and Swiss.  This is a keeper.  Only problem is this must be loaded with calories.  Next time I will only have one. Something a little different for Sunday breakfast.
