Oh my word!! These are absolutely irresistible! Use unsalted butter for depth of flavor. I toasted the pecans (spread in a single layer on a baking sheet, bake in preheated 350 degree oven for 5 minutes, flip the nuts over using a pancake turner, and bake 5 minutes more, or until they become fragrant. Watch so they don't burn.) Also added a slight dash of real almond extract. Both these measures really make the flavor pop! I've made both with all white sugar as written and with half brown sugar, and the consensus here is that the brown sugar flavor is richer. The ingredients might not sound like much, but believe me, the flavor really is all that. They're nice and crunchy, making for an extremely satisfying cookie experience. NOTE: To the reviewer who found her product too salty, I'd guess it's because she used salted butter. I've never had a problem with excess saltiness with this recipe, and I've made it many times. I do, however, always use unsalted butter (as is recommended with any baked product.) If you only have salted butter, I'd recommend cutting the additional salt back to 1/4 tsp (or even 1/8 tsp if you're salt-sensitive.) NOTE: To correct the review dated 12/28/10, baking powder is NOT just baking soda and cornstarch. It's 1) baking soda, 2)acid (like cream of tartar, which she notes she used, but failed to note in the ingredients) and 3) starch to absorb any moisture and prevent it from activating before it's used. Ratio is 1:2:1 in the order given above.

I agree these are stupid good!  I followed the recipe exactly except I fridged the dough overnight and rolled them into 58 1-1/2 inch balls instead of 1 inch.  (Baked cookies were 3 inches diameter)  I also measured the flakes out before crushing and crushed them just until they lost that round flake shape and ended up with just a little over 2 cups crushed flakes.

Baked 2 sheets at a time, rotating top and bottom sheets after 6 min and baking 6 min more.

I was a little worried at first when I bit into one as soon as the first batch cooled down.  I didn't like the way the cornflake bits stuck to my teeth.  However, after a few hours that sticky-chewiness goes away and you're left with a very buttery cookie that has a delicate crunch to it.  They're aptly named.  This is a new favorite!

These cookies are really yummy.  My daughter said "these cookies are stupid-good"! I guess that is a pretty high compliment. lol  I did use half regular sugar and half brown sugar and added two lightly beaten eggs.  Next time I will probably cut the salt back to 1/4 tsp. I measured the cornflakes first and then crushed them.  Also, note that these are  thin cookies.
I will definately make these again!

I followed the directions and added in a little almond extract like some of the other reviews stated.  The cookies tasted okay, but for my own personal taste, it wasn't sweet enough. Next time I will add in 1/2 cup brown sugar with the white sugar.  Instead of using almond extract, I think I would add vanilla extract.  With this batch all I could taste was the corn flakes and the nuts.  I think I may use less cornflakes and pecans too.  Oh, and like the other reviewers, the cookies did spread out and was very flat. I rated it a five star because I know these cookies would taste great if it was sweeter.  It is similar to a shortbread cookie recipe.

These are wonderful cookies-   very light and melt-in-your-mouth crunchy. I added just a little almond flavoring as another reviewer suggested and it was the perfect touch! Also, instead of baking soda and cream of tartar,  I substituted the same amount of baking powder. Just in case you didn't know, baking powder is made from baking soda and cornstarch.  These will definitely  go on my favorites list.

These cookies are absolutely delicious!  I made them for a cookie swap and received so many compliments!  I LOVE them, especially straight out of the freezer, no thawing necessary.  Try it.

This cookies really are "stupid good," as another reviewer's daughter put it! I got this recipe from a friend, have gotten many compliments on the cookies and have given out the recipe many times.  I recently brought a double batch to a women's retreat.  They didn't look that impressive, sitting there among all the other  desserts, and sat untouched for a long time.  I have to admit, I was a little disappointed.  Then someone tried them!  Then she was telling everyone, "You HAVE to try one of these!  These cookies are amazing!"

I followed the recipe exactly and they didn't look like the picture or taste anything like I expected.  Way too salty.  I don't know what I did wrong.  Next time I will cut the salt add eggs and brown sugar like another reviewer.

I seriously can't believe how good these cookies are!!! The unexpected crunch from the cornflakes makes all the difference.  I wasn't going to change anything about the recipe, until I realized I didn't have enough butter.  I ended up using 3 sticks of butter, and 1/2 cup of vegetable oil, and they came out just fine.  Also, I didn't have any pecans, but I did however have some pistachio coated, toffee crunch on hand, so I put that in my food chopper and added it to the mixture...I still can't stress enough how awesome these cookies are!!!  : )))
