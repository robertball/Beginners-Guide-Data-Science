This is a great muffuletta. I used red onion instead of the pickled onions and omitted the vegetable oil. I used only olive oil. It turned out great! This is totally authentic. You'll think you are in the Big Easy! Thanks Boo for a fantastic recipe!

I am a New Orlean's Central Grocery Muffeletta fan.  This recipe was great!! Almost as terrific as Central Grocery's version. Maybe better, because I made it fresh!! My husband and I savored every bite.  My daughter liked it on a Hawaiin Bread Roll, with a sweetness to it.  My son is not an olive fan.  That's o.k., more for me to eat!! Will definitely make this again.

I made this for Superbowl, omitting the capers and mortadella. Delicious!  My husband, who was hesitant about the recipe, just loved it.  One hint, make sure your olives are well drained and dried off with paper towels if you don't want the salad to taste too briny. This would be great to take on picnics or car trips as it can be made in advance, and keeps well in the fridge otr a cooler.  Thanks, Boo!

Boo, baby, ya done good. This is the best olive salad recipe I['ve ever seen (and I live in N.O. where I can buy the real deal.) The reviewer who said she adds mustard -- well, honey, don't come to New Orleans and do that, people will be appalled. My ONLY criticism -- we never, EVER say "N'Awlins" here!!! Noo Awlins, New Orlins, New Or-le-unz, yes, the Crescent City, okay, but never that silly Frank Davis "Nat'rally Nawlins" contraction. I give this recipe five fleur-de-lis's!

This was truly impressive in taste and presentation!  Most people raved about it though the olive salad didn't suit a few of the others who wouldn't have liked it on anything else anyway.  I was fortunate enough to get the round loaves made fresh the morning I needed them from the Italian grocery where I could purchase everything else.  DEEELICIOUS!  I read in the reference section that the original and best mortadella can be purchased only in Italy.  Has anyone found this to have changed?

The sandwich was very good. The olive spread is very similar to what you would find on Bourbon Street. I prepared the olive spread the night before to allow the flavors to blend. Made it for Superbowl Sunday and my friends loved it.

Never heard of this till I saw it on Emeril. Following his lead I make this recipe but I wrap it if foil and put it in the oven at 375 for 15-20 minutes before serving. Try it this way too.

The olive salad was a huge hit at a tailgate party.  I am making it again as a gift for family who loved it.  As close to the original Central Grocery olive salad as I have tasted.  A keeper!

hoooo, yeah. I make the olive salad in the food processor - rough chop the stuff, then just three or four pulses to keep it coarse. then add the liquids and seasonings in the jar it's going to be stored in. 
So hard to get good bread up here in Maine, but a crusty italian loaf is a must.
In season, I spread a few fresh basil leaves on top of the olive salad when building the sandwich. 
 I use cappicola; mild or hot. I usually make at least two of these, so I do one spicy and one mild. 
This is the best summer picnic meal EVER. 
Thank you for sharing an outstanding recipe.
Vegetarians like this with roasted red peppers and/or grilled eggplant to replace the meats.

This is my 3rd time making this awesome sandwich.  I buy the olive mix premade from an awesome local grocery and all of the meats and cheese, too.  I refuse to use Mortedello (it's bolonga!!).  I buy Coppa Colla instead.  YUM!  This may make 8 servings but, my family of 3--hubby, 18 year old son and me---eat the whole thing easily.  I do not eat very much. If there are leftovers, the hubby wants them in his lunch which ticks off the son who figured it would be his breakfast.  They have asked me to find the biggest rounds of bread I can.  Too funny!  Maybe I will make it next time on a long french loaf just for grins.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My baby is now off to college in the morning.  He requested this as his "last supper".  You know you have a great recipe when an 18 yr old boy requests it for a special occasion.  I will have to drive down to his dorm with 1 or 2 of these and surprise him and his friends one of these days.  Won't tell him I did it because of empty nest syndrome.....just a Mom wanting to surprise her son.  :). Oh, I also wrap it tight in Saran Wrap and then weigh it down with heavy books or ? for at least 4 hours to overnight. That spreads the juices of the olive salad so nicely.

I give this 5 stars because it is really 2 recipes in one:  a great olive salad (really, fantastic) and a sandwich that is easily customized.
The olive salad is very forgiving if you have to substitute or omit, but the original is really the best!!
I made 6x the olive salad for a party...FYI it made about a gallon if you omit the cauliflower.
We made 85 sandwiches using 8" soft French subs and, wrapped in foil, they toasted up perfectly the next day!  Chlled, the sandwiches did take about 20-30 minutes to bake - depending on your oven.
They cut well into smaller "mini muffalettas" and made a great cocktail sandwich.

The trick to the olive salad is to roughly chop green and black olives (your choice) in a food processor, add good, fruity, olive oil, a dash of GOOD balsamic vinegar, some freshly pressed garlic - cover and let it sit overnight at room temperature.
Mix well and spread the inside of your fresh Italian bread with the liquid that collects after a day or so.  Broil for a minute or two, just to brown a little and proceed with the recipe with whatever deli meats and cheeses you prefer - quality counts.  We used to order two of these at Central Grocery and take them home on the plane from New Orleans - YUM!

Yum! Great addition to our Superbowl
buffet. I omitted the pearl onions and
instead, added sliced red onion. I couldn't find mortadella so I left that
out as well. I didn't want soggy leftovers so I put the meats on the bread and put the salad in between the meat and the cheese. We thought it was even better the next day!

WOWIE! Although I've never been to New Orleans, nor do I know anything about Central Grocery, I can only imagine what gourmet delights lay in store. This sandwich was outstanding! I allowed the olive salad to sit for two days, then prepared the sandwiches. Boo, you've outdone yourself on this recipe.This olive salad is too good to be kept a secret. Many folks in Seattle will be happy to get jars of this from me. Then you'll have many many fans of your wonderful Muffeletta! Thanks so much.

Absolutely Outstanding!!!!  Sandwich will hold in fridge tightly wrapped in plastic for up to 4 days.  I used my mini processor for the olives & veggies to speed things up - pulse function made things perfect.  (Small capers went in whole.)  

Thanks for this recipe!!!

Not being American I stumbled randomly onto muffuletta concept. Since then I tried a bunch of different muffuletta recipes, but this one is amazing. I followed it to the letter, and the result was amazing.....Extremely rich yet refreshing taste. My husband, who is a very choosy eater loved it and everyone else who tried was impressed. I don't know what the original tastes like, but would recomend this recipe to anyone. Oh, and not to forget, it is really important to let the olive mixture stand at least overnight for the flavors to develop (tasting it straight away takes away at least half of its charm).

I made these for a grad party, and they were a real hit. Easy on the cook too, because you can make them the night before, wrap tightley in plastic wrap, and keep them in the fridge. It actually improves the flavor. Because I was short on time I used premade olive salad with excellent results.

I'm not much of a recipe follower when it comes to cooking (I like to improvise a lot), but this one looked too perfect to change. I followed the recipe exactly a few weeks ago and my dad is STILL raving about it! Next time I might leave out the capers as I don't remember them being in the muffulettas we used to get in the French Quarter, but otherwise perfection! This is the real deal. The hardest part is wrapping them up and letting them sit overnight, but the wait is worth it -- they're SO much better the second day. Thanks for the recipe!

This is so good!  I only used 1/2 cup of olive oil in the olive salad because the amount called for seemed so decadent, but it was great anyway.  The recipe didn't mention it, but I diced the olive salad ingredients, since the muffuletta I had previously was made that way. Also, I used the celery and carrot that came in the pickled cauliflower bottle instead of fresh.  Genoa salami is much better than the less expensive versions.  I don't think I will ever get tired of this sandwich!

Needed a special sandwich to take for a picnic supper, and this was awesome!  I too made the olive salad (double the  recipe) a night before as others have suggested.  Only changes I made were to eliminate capers (don't care for them) and used red onion instead of the cocktail onions.  Thank you Boo!

I made a few changes: skipped the capers, used Mezzetta Italian mix with cauliflower, celery and carrot, used hot pickled chili peppers in place of the pepperoncinis, skipped canola oil (used a little extra EVOO) and skipped the mortadella. Made a great muffaletta, according to my guests (I don't eat meat so didn't try this one).

Made the olive salad and set out of a tray of meats and cheeses for our family's "sandwich night".  Loved the olive salad beyond anything reasonable...it was even good alone in a sandwich!

This olive salad is PERFECT for the muffuletta sandwich!  We had these from Central Grocery on our honeymoon, and I was trying to recreate as an anniversary present.  I ommitted the cauliflower,  carrots, celery seed and canola oil.  I found a bakery here that makes muffuletta bread and went to a good deli to get salami, coppa, and provolone.  The sandwich was so good I could hear the blues and smell the gulf!  Tip: don't be temped to skimp on the amount of olive oil.  Part of the beauty of the sandwich is the olive salad soaking into the dense bread to make it moist.  If you haven't tried this yet... you should!

I made this easy by buying:  Marzetta's California Hot Mix (pickled celery, carrots, cauliflower) and cans of chopped black and green olives.  The rest I kept the same.  With this modification the recipe was simple AND delish!

I assembled my sandwich in the morning before a day at the zoo. I wrapped it in plastic wrap and it stayed in the cooler until we were ready to eat. It turned out delicious! Wonderful and loved by everyone!

I must be @ central market in New Orleans...cause  it taste just like it!  I made a "reduced fat" version.   I measured 1 cup WHOLE stuffed olives, then crushed/minced those.   I only added 2 table spoons of extra light virgin oil and 1 table spoon of pure canola oil.    For the veggies (celery, carrots, cauliflower) I used Mezetta Italian Mix Giardiniera (found near the olives - has that all in one jar set to go, just mince) and added an additional table spoon of each.   I left out: Kalamatas, Basil, Oregano, Onion and only added 1 teaspoon of red wine vinegar.   Made: 26 tablespoons of olive spread Calories per tablespoon: 25 calories  I used different bread and my own combo of deli meat/cheese.   My main goal was to create a low fat version of this spread for sandwiches and it worked.  Amazing, loved this recipe. I used to contemplate paying someone to buy some of this spread and shipping it out to me from New Orleans.   My brother said if more oil was added to soak the bread (which I avoided due to cals), this would have been it!

This was good, not great. I didnt care for the taste of the celery seed in the olive mixture.  My husband liked it, but I could taste it too much. I used a whole wheat bread that was okay with the recipe, not quite as good as a white italian loaf would be but for health reasons, I substituted.

This is the real thing!  This recipe is the closest I've found to what a real N'awlins Muffuletta should taste like.  It's a staple at our Mardi Gras party every year and everyone always raves.  We have some serious muffuletta conuseurs and they just love this recipe.  I also make a the olive salad a few days early for the flavors to develop.

Pretty good! I'm not a fan of olives (especially Kalamatas), but this wasn't bad at all. I wouldn't make this often, but for Fat Tuesday fare, it hit the spot. :) To my surprise, I thought the olive salad was the best part! If the ratio of Kalamata / stuffed green olives were reversed, it would have not been to my liking at all. So that the olive taste wouldn't overwhelm every bite, I coarsely chopped mine (as opposed to crushing them). I also chopped my pepperoncini (biting into a whole one didn't appeal to me). Because I prefer a warm sandwich, I heated mine (foil covered) in a 250 degree oven for about 25 minutes. Ironically, my local Italian market didn't have seeded Italian bread, but I found a 1 lb. loaf at a popular grocery chain. I'm soooo glad I found a seeded loaf of bread. It really made a HUGE difference, IMHO. NOTE: Plan ahead so that you can refrigerate your assembled sandwich for a few hours - and be sure to add some of the oil from your olive salad so that it soaks into your bread (it adds GREAT flavor...yum!). I've never had a true muffaletta from Central Grocery, but if it tastes anything like this, I'd be in for a real treat! Thanks for sharing, Jenn! :-)

I started by making the bread. I used Mama D’s Italian from this site, it is a favorite of mine and the recipe will produce 2, 9”- 10” boules.When the loaves were formed for the second rise, I spritzed it with a little water and sprinkled sesame seeds on top and covered. About 20-25 minutes later they were ready for the oven and just before I put them in, I gently brushed on an egg mixture of 2 TBSP of cold water and 1 egg.  Assembly: I had made the olive salad, as written, the day before and put the mixture into a jar and made sure there was plenty of olive oil to cover the mixture. I then carefully hollowed out the top and bottom of the bread after slicing through the middle. I weighed out the mixture into 4 prep bowls and then laid out the meats and cheeses for assembly. I spread the salad into each half of the bread evenly and started layering the meat and cheese on, making sure everything came out to the edge. After the last of the cheese was layered on, I aligned the top to the bottom and flipped the top to the bottom. I ended up with 2, 3+ pound sandwiches. I wrapped both sandwiches in plastic wrap and have them in the fridge to let the flavors come together. *UPDATE* Just got back from the party, and the Muffuletta was a big hit. I'll be using this quite often for sure!

Rating this probably isn't fair since I had to change so much. 1. I bought jarred olive salad. I'm sure homemade would be better but time was short and the ingredients would have been very expensive. (I will try it for a special occassion sometime.)
2. I used swiss and provolone.
3. I don't know what mortadella is. I used salami, turkey and pepperoni. The point with the meet seems to be to add to the bold taste of the sandwich. Ham would be better than turkey I'm sure, but since I only had turkey it was fine.
4. Bread is very important. It must be soft bread. Mine was a little crusty and we agreed soft would be better. He made the comment not knowing I didn't have the right bread.
5. I wasn't sure my teenagers would like the olive taste. Wrong. They loved it.

I've never made Muffuletta before but was interested in trying it. This recipe is awesome! I had a small get together when some of my relatives came to visit. Everyone loved it. I thought I would have tons of leftovers but it was gone by the end of the night.

My daughter has been obsessed with the Princess & the Frog movie and asked me to make several of the traditional New Orleans dishes mentioned in it.  I had NO idea what muffuletta was until I found this recipe.  I'm in no way shape or form a big fan of olives, aside from black ones in mexican-type dishes, so I was a little aprehensive about trying this one.   I did see in the reviews that some others who normally don't care for olives liked this sandwich, so I had some hopes I'd be the same.  After gathering all the ingredients for just 4 servings (1 loaf), the sandwich was quickly assembled and wrapped tightly in the fridge from lunchtime until dinner.  The final verdict?  My husband LOVED it and claims it should become a staple and that everyone should eat this at least once.  The kids just kind of picked at it - my daughter didn't eat the bread and my son didn't eat the cheese.  lol.  As for me - I'm still not a fan of uncooked olives, so this wasn't a huge hit with me.  The meat, cheese and bread were good though!  I'm still giving this 5 stars because it was fun to make and try with my family and the fact that my husband thought it was so good.  Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful! It's easier to use the olive topping that you put on Italian Beef for this sandwich. Pick up a jar at Michaels Fresh Market, Dominick's or even Jewel.

This olive salad is absolutely fantastic!!!!  It is great for...Superbowl, Tailgating, New Year's Eve, Mardi Gras, Picnicing, Party time, Snack time, or ANYTIME!!!!!!  It is just really good.  I used 100% evoo.  A good substitute for mortadella is bologna.  I also used an immersion blender to blend my salad and it seemed easier than using my chopper and easier to clean than a regular blender or food processer.  I always double the recipe and have leftover.  Because it is immersed in vinegar and olive oil, it keeps really well for awhile in the refrigerator.

This is soooo good! Even my mom, who turns her nose up at any sandwich that doesn't have turkey on it, loved it. Thanks for the olive salad recipe -- it's great and lends itself nicely to tweaks and additions/omissions.

I haven't made the sandwiches yet, we will have them for dinner.  But I'm rating the olive salad.  I absolutely love it!  I snuck a taste after mixing the ingredients and this olive salad is as close to Central Grocery's as you can get.  I used a couple of jars of mixed pitted olives (kalamata, green and prune,) I grated the carrot and diced the pepperocini's, I wasn't sure what I was supose to do with the coctail onions by the recipe, so I put them in whole just to marinate the flavors, I won't put them on the sadwiches though.  I also left out the canola and added a little more olive oil.  Also, since the olives I used weren't stuffed with pimento's I added some separately to the mix.  I used celery salt instead of celery seed since I didn't have any on hand.  It makes a lot, so I'll be giving my sister a jar to take home.  I never buy the jarred varieties of olive salad, because they just don't compare to what I expect.  My sister and I were just talking about how much we missed the olive salad from the Central Grocery; this is a winner!

We were muffuletta virgins, th mister and I. This is an amazing sandwich. The only changes I made were for personal preference and practicality. I cut out the cocktail onions because neither of us are fond of them, cut back on the pperoncini a little because we didn't have quite as many as asked for, upped the pickled cauli because we ARE very fond of it, and served it on Olive & Onion Bread from this site because it was the right size and shape and we had some in the freezer. Excellent!! Thanks!

The real trick is getting good bread. Foccaccia bread works really well for soaking up the oil from the olive salad. I doubled the olive oil in the salad, added some roasted red pepper and halfed the amount of meat/cheese, it was excellent! One recommendation would be to used toothpicks to keep the sliced sandwich pieces together.

A great recipe to try once...It is a very good recipe but a lot of work. We live in the Midwest so it was quite a chore to find the right ingredients (i.e. Italian bread, cauliflower, molenta). I guess maybe we were expecting something more spectacular after all the work and wait. Maybe we are just spoiled and/or lazy but our favorite deli serves a tremendous muffuletta that we prefer to this version. At $6.00 for a sandwich that feeds 2+ people, the deli is not only a whole lot easier, but far less expensive.

This was absolutely incredible!  It's extremely flavorful and surprisingly easy to make.  By far the best olive spread I've ever had.  I can't wait to make it for company!

My kids have been turkey and mayo with pickles exclusively their whole lives.  This recipe changed that.  I blend mine to hide the cauliflower and capers from my kids and they will destroy this sandwich.  My 8 year old would eat a 12 inch sub of this meal and he is only 55 lbs.  Serves a crowd!  Enjoy!

Too much oil. Cut the oil in 1/2 and was plenty. Otherwise made just as stated.

This was fun to make.  I made it vegetarian for a friend's party.  I used fresh mozzarella in place of meat and it got great reviews.  Thanks!

Didnt have all the meat ingredients. Made do with pepperoni, salami, ham and turkey. The olive dressing was UNBELIEVABLE! Would double it next time... Makes for a nice change from the typical sandwich. Good for company too...

These were a super hit!! We made them for Super bowl/Mardi Gras party and they were great! I bought the bread from a south coast grocery store specifically for muffuletta's..They turn out HUGE so we ended up with waymore than enough. I put mine in tin foil, let them sit in the fridge for a couple of hours and baked them for about 30 minutes and served them hot...Fabulous!!

Made this for Super Bowl.  I have never had muffuletta but I have seen it prepared on the Food Network and it always makes my mouth water!  The problem I had is that after being in the refrigerator for the afternoon, my loaf was all soggy on the bottom (from the olive salad).  Is this normal for muffuletta?  I don't know but I didn't care for the soggy texture.  It reminded me of when my kids throw pieces of stale Wonder Bread in the pond for the ducks to eat!  Aside from the unappealing texture of the bread, the salad itself was okay.  I don't think I'll make this again--unless of course the Saints make it to another Super Bowl!

I really loved this as did my family we hosted a few unadventurous guests who said it was okay. I have never had a Muffuletta before so I have nothing to compare this to all I can say is it was super tasty! Only thing I changed was using celery salt instead of celery seed because I didnt have it on hand and used red wine vinegar infused with garlic. Oh, and put it on sun dried tomato bread, yummy!!!

Awesome, easy, huge Party food!  I followed the directions to a T - except for the celery seed.  I brought this to super bowl and most made fun of the name 8 - )  Once they tasted it everyone asked what resteraunt it was from.  I made the olive relish a day before, put the sandwiches together around 10am, wrapped them in plastic wrap for around 4 to 5 hours before serving.  Left overs were great the next day! These were a little pricey to make if you use good meat and cheese but well worth it considering how many people they will feed plus the quality!

So yummy! Tastes really close to Central Grocer's. I ended up following the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing about it - although I doubled it. One recipe isn't enough for two sandwiches. This is one helluva expensive sandwich to make it but well worth it! Thanks, Boo, for an excellent recipe! I had to add that I tried making this again with the homemade bread recipe that someone here posted and it is DIVINE! I will forgo the bakery bread from now on!

This is a good recipe but instead of buying day old bread from the store, it is really easy to make your own especially with a bread machine. There is a web page www.nolacuisine.com that has a wonderful recipe for the bread and it takes very little time. I make it for just the bread and not necessarily the sandwich.

Made exactly as per recipe except I only had 6 hours to marinate the ingredients.  It was good but I thought the olive salad overpowered the taste of the rest of the sandwich as did the friend who shared it with me.

Outstanding recipe!  It made way more than 8 servings.  Everyone wanted the recipe. My only negative is that it was a little salty with all the olives and lunch meat.

Definitely a keeper!  I didn't have all the ingredients such as onions and celery salt but even without these ingredients, it was excellent.  Even my husband said that the Olive Salad made a plain sub sandwich taste extraordinary.

Wow!!  I cannot say enough about how great this sandwich is!  Chopping a lot of the relish ingredients in the food processor (as someone else suggested) sure was a time saver.  I toned the spices down a lot because I don't like hot things - reduced the black pepper to 1/4 tsp., and omitted the pepperoncini peppers.  I don't like onion after-taste, so I left off the onions, too.  I reduced the amount of oil a ton - used only 1/4 cup olive oil, and omitted the canola oil entirely.  I lightly basted the bread with olive oil, then spread on the olive relish.  It was wonderful!  Thanks so much for the recipe!!

Great recipe!  Everyone loved it.  It tasted better than the muffuletta I had in New Orleans. I served it with Boudreaux's Zydeco Stomp Gumbo in a cup on the side, fresh fruit, and cole slaw.

This is a good sandwich, but it did not taste the same as the Muffuletta I got in New Orleans.

Also I prefer mine toasted and add a tiny amount of a hearty mustard.

This is a wonderful recipe. The dressing is outstanding. I have never had this before, but now I will be making it again and again. I made it as written, except for the capers and canola, as I just don't like those particular ingredients. Everything is right on. Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

This was a great tasting sandwich although it was definitely labor intensive. I wish I would have doubled the olive salad because I barely had enough for both sandwiches and it took about 45 minutes to prep and chop all of the veggies. I probably won't make this often, but it really was delicious!

The olive salad alone is reason to give this recipe 5 stars. It's crazy expensive if you can't buy small amounts of ingredients (I am somewhat rural) so I made a double batch and with a few more green olives and capers, I can make another. I had about a gallon of the stuff and thought I'd never use it all. I gave some away but then I tried it on home made gnocchi and, well, I'm keeping the rest and making more. Bruschetta, pizza, cheese and crackers...straight out of the jar. It's phenomenal. I once bought a jar from Central Grocery in NOLA and it was not this good! My only tweak was a little chopped fresh parsley.

This is one awesome sandwich! Delicious crowd pleaser. I especially appreciate that the olive salad is made ahead of time; making the sandwich is a breeze.  Once the sandwich is made, it travels well.  Seriously would give this 10 stars for great taste + satisfying + ease. Thank you!!!!

I come back to this recipe again and again - always a crowd-pleaser.  The only trouble I have is finding it - the second "U" in the title means this doesn't come up when searched!

The olive salad is amazing, even to people who don't like olives.  It's also very flexible -- don't NOT make it because you don't have a few of the items.  And be sure to include the celery and carrots - tho a small amount that little crunch makes all of the difference.

Absolutely awesome for salt lovers!!!!  Pure heaven.  Things not really needed in olive salad (which will save time and money) - pickled cauliflower, celery, and carrots.

Reeeeeeally tasty! I made this for a catering event that had a bit of a theme... and this fit perfectly for New Orleans! The flavors are incredible together - but it's a bit messy!! I love the presentation but it's so hard to eat! Oh well, it was a hit!

I can't give it 5 stars.  I really wanted 3 1/2, but it doesn't give that as an option.  I used all the ingredients except the pickled cauliflower.  I couldn't find it.  I used a round sourdough bread and even though I dug out as much bread as I could, it still didn't work.  The olive salad was great, but I too thought there was too much meat in it it.  I think w/ some tweaking for our tastes, I might try it again sometime down the road.

Wow! I made this for our Superbowl Party and everyone raved.  I made lots of changes to the olive salad; used an olive spread,omitted the pepperoncini, onions and canola oil.  I did make the olive salad the night before.  I assembled the sandwich in the morning, using black forest ham, Genoa salami, and capicola,
mozzarella and provolone.  I did mirror
layers on each half of the bread. Then I put the halves together and wrapped it in
plastic wrap.  I refrigerated it with a 
weight on top to really compress the 
slices of meat and cheese.  When it was
cut, each piece had beautiful layers of 
meat and cheese and olive salad.  It was
delicious. The next time I make it I will
add a center layer of roasted red pepper.
Thank you for a great sandwich!

This was I big hit at the family picnic. I used only olive oil, and substitute 1/2 a fresh onion for the cocktail onions. I also left out the cauliflower, celery and carrot. Will defiantly make aging.

This sandwich was the best!!  I haven't had a muffuletta in (many) years and as soon as I tasted this it took me back - it was a nice memory.  I made them for my Mardi Gras party and I had a few guests that have been to New Orleans and they said it was "right on".  Thanks so much for this recipe it really is the best!!

This is the best muffuletta I've ever had, by far. I used this recipe (using chopped artichoke hearts instead of the cauliflower I couldn't find) for a family picnic and it was the hit of the party. We've had muffuletta in restaurants, but the olive salad always seems skunky compared to this awesome fresh version. It's easy to make, and carries and looks as great as it takes.  From now on I'm sure this olive salad will always be in my fridge. Its really good on pita wedges too!!

As a frequent traveler to NOLA, the trip wouldn't be complete without a muffuletta from Central Grocery.  WOW.  What a great clone.  This is to be a staple in my fridge from now on.  Thanks for the savings on airfare :)

I made this yesterday to take to a Saints fan's home for NFL football.  I didn't have time to prep a day ahead but the olive mixture did get a chance to marinate about two hours and everyone there loved it!  My friend said it was as good as he has ever had back home!

This is absolutely beautiful. I've never had a chance to go to New Orleans, and this is my first muffuletta ever so I really haven't got the right to tell how great is this. But to me this is awesome and the olive salad gives such a unique flavour. And definitely I'll make it again.

The olive salad was wonderful, upon other recommendations used red onions instead of pearl and made it the night before making the day off prep very easy.  I used the oil from the salad as a spread on the bread and toasted the bread.  Due to a time constraint, I built the sandwich without letting the bread cool and it slightly heated up the meat and cheese creating a great blend of flavors.  I made this for an outdoor music festival that allowed picnic baskets.  I was able to wrap it and it traveled well.  When I unwrapped it everyone around me was amazed, the smells were mouth watering and people I didn't even know were asking for a taste.  Great recipe!

I made this for the super bowl and tasted it yesterday, my husband said it will be a hit and I  thought it was the best turkey sandwich I ever tasted. I made a few changes to adjust for turkey:

Instead of cauliflower, capers, and marinated onion I used a small jar of marinated artichokes, 5 sundried tomatoes in oil, and 7 oz jar of roasted red pepper, and 2 T of chopped onion, and put everything in the food processor. I am surving it on ciabatta rolls with sliced Roma tomatoes.

Very good. I would say this has 10 large servings or 20 small servings. It cost me about $40 to buy the ingredients. Worth the cost considering how much is makes. Very good sandwich. Nice change from the normal tailgating foods.

Not for the faint of heart!  I didn't have the cauliflower, and only had hard salami, ham and provolone, but the olive salad flavors were spectacular!  We couldn't believe we ate the whole thing --  I think my husband is afraid I'll make these again.

The best Muffuletta since Cafe Brazil's version in Dallas, TX.  So filling and mouthwatering!
If you can deal with the pungent smell and taste of olives, this is a real treat! For meatlovers, Italian food lovers and greek food lovers... this is the best!

This was fantastic! It was the most popular thing at our Super Bowl party.  Even people who aren't crazy about olives loved it. As with another reviewer, I think using a food processor to chop all this would really cut down on time/work involved.  Worth the effort, though!

Good Lawd Child :) this is some GOOOOOD EATS!!!  Made this for my Bunco group.  These ladies are some excellent cooks so I'm always looking for something very special when it's my turn and this nailed it!  Made it EXACTLY as written, I did make my relish 3 days ahead to let the flavors meld and I think this was better than the Muff I had in New Orleans.  I will make these babies AGAIN!  Thank you so much for sharing....

this is DELISH!!! Salty, briny goodness. Perfect party food, and sits well overnight—the flavors just develop more. I'm a part owner of a bar, and our cook made a few of these to serve at a Mardi Gras night....went over huge!

Okay I had my first muffuletta years ago at Cafe Maspero in New Orleans way before I moved down here. Now the world famous Central Grocery is right around the corner. Who knew. At the Cafe, the sandwich is served hot with fries. So delicious I wanted to die. So I cheated and purchased a jar of the olive mix. I love to cook but took a chance with a pre-made jar at the local farmers market. I used ciabatta rolls, took a spoonful of oil from the jar and brushed both sides of the roll, added about a spoonful of olive mix to both sides of the roll, placed a piece of havarti on one bun, provolone on the other bun, about three pieces of ham, four pieces of folded genoa salami and that was it. Took the sandwich and baked it 350 for about 10 minutes, 250 for another 5-6 minutes (want to get the cheese melted) then nuked it for 30 seconds to heat the meat in the middle. It was amazing! It was as good as the Cafe and better then any of the knock-offs I have tried here in Mississippi. Give it a try!

I did try it the day the magazine came and I saw the picture! The Deli employees were surely wondering why I was buying all those small portions of various meats! I saw the kitchen hint to use Giardiniere as a shortcut and I did that and added the olives (we are HUGE olive fans here). This was a huge hit for both of us, and lasted just the two of us several days. I just pulled the recipe and am making it for Memorial Day. Since I saw this recipe I always keep a jar of Giardiniere on my shelf now. I am going to try the Panera bread this time, if I can get it. LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! Definitely a treat for us as we "mostly" eat low cal/healthy, but sometimes you just have to go for it!

I have been craving a muffuletta for years now ever since my favorite little New Orleans style cafe closed. This sandwich was very yummy and definitely satisfied my cravings. I cut down the recipe for a personal serving since none of my pick kids would go near it. It was a definite treat for this mom not to share.

Couldn't be more perfect!!  I hit it out of the ballpark with this one, fo sure!  Everything I hoped it would be and more.  I baked the bread, assembled the sandwiches, then put them open-face under the broiler until the cheese browned and bubbled.  YUM!!  Thank you so much!!

This was fabulous.  I doubled the salad ingredients and it was delicious on sandwiches -- I have a request to make more to keep on hand!  I went to the deli and bought the exact ingredients listed, but I think you could include turkey or other kinds of cheese if you want to change it up.  This recipe is a keeper and will be my go-to party contribution.

I love this recipe. I have found myself adding this mix to other foods as well.  It is so tasteful and reminds me so much of being the quarter. My husband is making a double batch of this so that he can add the spicier seasonings to his batch.

Muffi was invented by Fertita family grocery and deli in Shreveport, la.  This is a good copy but the original olive mix was a family secret that they gave to NO ONE!  The original family store has been closed for a long time now, but they established a restaurant that still is in operation.  I ate my first Muffi about 50 years ago as takeout on a bench outside Fertita's store.  Absolutely delicious and so much better than the wannabes you find these days posing as Muffi's.

No changes. I make this for holiday bbqs and gatherings and everyone loves it. We save it for late night "I need a snack" time and it's always a hit.

You absolutely have to make the olive relish the night before. Something magical happens in the fridge overnight. The relish smells god-awful when you first make it. It's too sharp and the flavors stand out too much. But the next day....it's heaven. And I don't care for olives or any of the stuff that makes up the relish.

Rather than making my own olive mix, I used Boscoli Italian olive mix made in New Orleans.  Hard to find but found it at World Market.

Made this to take to an outdoor concert.  I made the olive salad the day before so the spices could sink in.  Then assembled the sandwiches a couple hours in advance.  They were delicious and I got lots of compliments (including from my brother who is a professional chef)!  I used 2 regular Italian  (wide but not circular) loaves of bread with sesame seeds.  I was worried that i needed crustier bread to avoid sogginess but these worked out perfectly.  I didn't cut them till we were ready to eat.  The 2 sandwiches served 6 people with almost 3/4 of one of them left over!  I will definitely make this again!

Really good sammie. The only thing I'll do differently next time is fill it with additional olive mixture and decrease the celery seed. But I WILL be making this one again! Thanks for the recipe!

I've made a recipe similar to this.  Instead of mortadella I just use regular bologna.  I get large, unsliced Kaiser type rolls to make individual sandwiches.  The olive salad can be bought in most larger grocery stores.  Marilyn

This was good. I was a bit surprised that my kids liked it as much as they did, given all of the colored "bits and thingys" in it. It wasn't quite what I was expecting. It's a given that a recipe can be made or broken based on quality of ingredients. I bought so many jars of brined stuff but was not familiar with brands and sampled nothing before preparation. So, that may very well be the reason. My 7 year old asked if I could make this sandwich again--and I will, after tasting testing the individual ingredients better.

You should bake the 'built' sandwich to melt the cheese at least. I grew up in NOLA and mine were always 'toasted'

I generally followed the recipe. I tried to lighten it up a bit, eliminating some of the oil. Added roast turkey breast as one of the meats, replacing the amounts of fatty meats, but not eliminating them. Didn't have the pickled onions or cauliflower.  But it turned out good. My husband loved it. It is a good dish for picnics and potlucks.  I will definitely  make it again.

I followed the recipe almost exactly. This was my first stab at olive salad and I was very satisfied with the results. My wife and daughter, who are both excellent at making and cooking yummy stuff, both liked this version of muffuletta sauce. I will probably experiment a bit with the recipe in future versions, but at present I really can't think of any major improvements that are needed.

If you heat the muffuletta in the oven or toaster oven for about 10 min or so, a hot sandwich like this is much much better.

I work for a deli/catering service, and we use this recipe (I got it out of the all recipes magazine) and everyone loves it! customers request it repeatedly for luncheons, and I always make extra for "quality checking" purposes. the only difference is we put it on ciabatta rolls. love love love it!

I actually just served a version of this to vegetarian guests and they loved it! Instead of the deli meats, I grabbed grilled zucchini, eggplant, roasted red pepper, and artichoke hearts from the salad bar at the grocery store, about 4-6 pieces each. Threw it on the sandwich with the olive salad and a few slices provolone. I have made the original meat version of this many times now and people rave about it too. I use jarred giardiniera to make the cauliflower/carrots/celery part easy. I’ve also used a variety of bread options: classic boule, baguette, plain burger buns, or even small crusty rolls for slider-style servings. This is an AMAZING recipe!!!
