This recipe was good, but if I make it again, I would use a cut other than a pork loin.  That much time in the slow cooker for the pork loin was just too much.  I think it would have worked better with a pork shoulder cut (not as lean a cut of meat) intended for these longer cooking times.  I would also cut back on the chicken broth to perhaps only 1/2 to 3/4 cup.  The horseradish mustard gave it a nice kick.  I would also sear the meat before adding it to the slow cooker (simply personal preference for a browner roast) and add a bit ot garlic and thyme to the "rub".  I may try this one again with the above modifcations.

Great recipe. I added a layer of small new potatoes along with the apples and onion. Also I didn't add any Liquid except for what the sauerkraut already had. It would be sauerkraut soup with any more liquid.

This was delicious!  Pork and kraut taste great together. Also try kraut and pork spareribs.  Pour half of kraut in slow cooker, cut ribs apart and add, then pour in the rest of the kraut and about a cup of chicken broth. Let it cook until the ribs fall off the bone. Sooo good!

I have to start by saying I HATE sauerkraut. I want to like it! I've always loved pork cooked in it, but can't stand the overwhelming flavor it has. I added potatoes to mine do I wouldn't have to come up with an additional side last minute, only change I made. And WOW!!!I never would have dreamt that an apple could make such a difference! I also want to say this us the first time I've felt compelled to rate and review a recipe. I've found many good recipes on here, but none that blew my mind like this one. THANK YOU!!

My Gran did a simple version of this using homemade kraut potatoes and various cut of pork. the potatoes are sliced thin and used almost like a crust. Layer of potatoes, then layer of pork cover with kraut then another layer of potatoes. about 3 layers for a roasting pan. Have tried it with various types of pork which is quite important to the taste. Side ribs are what seem best. Have tried with loin but just isn't quite right. Potatoes should be a russet variety. And the kraut has to be a salt cure not a wine cure. The wine cure really ruins the dish. You may want additional salt as the potatoes kill that but only after serving. Black pepper fresh coarse ground when putting together and a bit after works well. When done this really is a fantastic winter comfort food. If you like salty kraut, pork, and potatoes then try this or one of the versions you will find one that works and will never be able to make it enough to satisfy your taste for it.

This was excellent,after reading some of the other reviews, I omitted the salt altogether because of the chicken broth and next time I make this I will omit the chicken broth altogether is does make is somewhat soupy. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

My family really loved this and it was super easy to make.  Next time, however, I'd add more spice to kick it up a notch.  Perhaps more black pepper, some tarragon and crushed red pepper...

I used pork shoulder, spicy brown mustard, no apples or onions. Used my favorite spices while browning the roast before placing it in the crock pot on top of the sauerkraut and rubbed the mustard on top and sides. Instead of the broth I poured about 2/3 of a bottle of Chang beer over the top then drank the rest. After 6 or so hours on low I broke the pork up among the sauerkraut with forks and served it with garlic mashed potatoes. Absolutely delicious and couldn't be easier! Thanks!

Didn't use or need the broth. I do add plenty of chopped fresh cabbage to stretch the dish and lessen the saltiness, which in the end, is indetectable from the sauerkraut. My family loves this, and so easy.

WHY did I wait so long to try this recipe?! It is deceptively simple-sounding, soooo scrumptious, super easy to prepare and inexpensive (relatively!). I could not find horseradish mustard, I used a Tablespoon of yellow mustard and a Tablespoon of prepared horseradish mixed together (I could taste just a hint of the horseradish and it was delicious). The only other change I made was to sprinkle the tiniest bit of celery seed along with the salt and pepper. Just divine, thank you so much Nashville Nosher!

t have made this dish several times. I have tried different crock pots.  I have and haven't browned it.  Based on my experiences., here goes.  Definitely brown the roast.  I added potatoes on the bottom and put the roast on top.  I covered it in two small bags of sauerkraut.  The roast always comes out a little drier than when I cook it in the oven. 
I put my crock pot of low for six hours.  This was needed cook the potatoes.  I just think the roast is too lean like  one other person said.  I will use a  pork shoulder next time.

After I made it the second time I made some changes.  Used 2 onions and 2 apples, also added 2 tablespoons of Inglehoffer Cream Style Horseradish Sauce to the mustard mixed.  Browned the pork loin and then spread the mustard mixture on the meat.  Poured the chicken broth in before I added the meat, placed the meat on top of onions and apples, pour sauerkraut on top and cook.  After it cooked I broke the meat up and then cooked some egg noodles, added the meat mixture to egg noodles and served.  Was excellent and will make it again!!

Just made this today and love the flavor but I have to agree that its way too much chicken broth. The pork loin is too good a grade of pork. I should of used shoulder. I made as directed but did a 5 lb roast Next time I will use 3 lb and add potatoes.

Delicious. Based on other reviews we added baby red potatoes to the slow cooker. We also browned the pork loin before putting it in the slow cooker and draped 3 slices of bacon on the mustard-rubbed pork loin. Our neighbor tried some and immediately asked for the recipe -nancy lee

This is a good recipe. I love pork and sauerkraut. I make pork ribs and kraut and this is a lower fat version. I added a little garlic to it and potatoes the last few hours of cooking.

The recipe was quick and easy.The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because I added potatoes as others had done.I didn't care for the taste of the saurkraut they picked up.I wished I had just made some some mashed ones on the side.All and all it made for a terrific meal that we were ready for at the end of a busy day.

This is always a hit with my family.  Great Sunday dinner choice!  I make it pretty much by the recipe other than the quantities.  I try to use a 5+ pound pork loin and add extra horseradish to a generous coating of horseradish mustard.  I use a white onion sliced thin and layered with the apple in the bottom of the cooker.  I bury the pork loin in two 32 ounce jars of kraut, juice and all, along with a full can of chicken broth.  I sprinkle caraway seed in with the kraut to help mellow the bite.  Serve with a big batch of mashed potatoes and you've got a great meal!

We doubled the kraut as we never have enough in our family and added 2 t of caraway seed sprinkled over the top.  This is a a very tasty dish and the leftovers were even better.

I made this today and it was amazing and so easy! Only 2 things I changed were that I added 4 sliced potatoes to the bottom and I used a Dijon mustard because that's what I had. The pork was so tender and not at all dry.  I will be making this regularly!

This was good. I served it over rice, and was able to put several servings away to freeze, and it freezes well, also. I would add more apples next time.

Just served this to my family who are Kraut lovers.. for me, a little goes a long way, everyone had seconds (even me).  I made a similar recipe a few months back and it just didnt have the flavor this one did.  The only difference i made was a bigger jar of sauerkraut.  We will be enjoying this again.  Thank you for sharing!

Made this last night with boneless pork chops...  Was looking for something different and easy to do with pork.  Really great! Very easy!  I used about 3/4 of a can of chicken broth (any more would have made it too soupy!) Flavor was wonderful, tender and the onion/sauerkraut and apple was perfect. This is a really easy dish to put in the crock and forget about it.  I had it on high for 4-5 hours. (low would've been 6-8 or more..)   Served it with fresh veggies, and frozen mashed potatoes (really cutting time corners here) and my family loved it.  Makes for a great week night "homey" meal!

This was excellent! I substituted potatoes for the apple and only used maybe 1/4 cup of broth. Will for sure be making this again! Just wish more of my family loved sauerkraut as much as I do!

Will definitely make this again!  Love reading all the reviews and what everyone changes.  I placed granny Smith apple sliced on the bottom.  Sea salt and pepper on my pork loin.  Browned both sides.  Entire bag of sauerkraut and 1/2 can of beer.  Cooked 3 1/2 hours on low setting.  So tender and lots of leftovers.  Thanks!

I made this and it turned out to be really good.  Since I live alone,  I take one serving to eat immediately and freeze the rest. in one serving containers.  I like the food even better as it has mingled while in the freezer.   I just take a helping and microwave it.

Not good - pork was very dry, very tough and not enough flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly, but wish I had tried a different cut of pork as one reviewer suggested.  The sauerkraut was good though.  The dogs ended up being the beneficiary of last night's meal.

I made the recipe as stated except for two small changes.  I added a tablespoon of brown sugar.  Also, if you add 1-1/2 cups of chicken broth you will have way too much liquid at the end.  I probably put in 1/2 to 3/4 cup of chicken broth, and could have gotten away with less.  Everything stays very moist in the crock pot.  I'll do it again.  Great recipe.

Made it for visiting family. All thought it the best pork roast they ever had. Will definitely make it again with a couple of minor changes. I added some new potatoes and will continue to do in the future. I also added only half the liquid and used beer instead of stock. In addition, in thefuture I will double the sauerkraut  and will add only a tablespoon or two of beer. Definitely glad I tried this.

I probably will not make it again.  I liked it, but  I like a stronger sauerkraut flavor.  This had a mild, sweeter taste.

I made some changes, I used one jar of ham glaze instead of horseradish mustard,  one red delicious apple instead of granny green. Saurerkraut in the bag has more juice. Added One can of pineapple tidbits drained.  Added Yukon golden potatoes small bag cut in halves.

This turned out great.  I didn't use as much of the chicken broth but the combination of sauerkraut and apple made a fantastic flavor.  i also threw in diced red potatoes.  Very easy and tasty!!!

Went even easier and used a pre-seasoned tenderloin cut in half, can of sauerkraut, and can of chicken broth. Cooked on low for 3-1/2 hours and high for the remaining 3-1/2.  With an hour to go I added 1/4 C brown sugar. Was delicious and the tenderloin fell apart into shreds. Served with frozen mashed potatoes and was a no effort meal.

This was a delicious recipe. I added some brown sugar to reduce the "bite" of the sauerkraut and served it over homemade mashed potatoes. I will make this again.

I found this to be a bit bland even though I added extra apples and onions.   I browned it first, but it still was a bit tough.

I agree with some of the other reviews; there is too much chicken stock. I made this with the stock amount recommended; it was a bit much. You could probably cook some off. That said, this is delicious. I might try it again, with beer instead of chicken stock.

The only things I changed in the recipe was that I braised the roast before rubbing it with the horseradish. I didn't have a granny smith apple so substituted a pink lady.  I heated the chicken broth in the same pan I had braised the meat in so I could deglaze the pan and reclaim those tiny bits of deliciousness. I had started with a roast that was only partially thawed so I decided to turn the crock pot from low to high after 1 hour. It was perfectly done after a total of 6 hours.

Very blah, no tang to the sauerkraut, probably due to the apple.   We like good, tasty sauerkraut so this was disappointing.

I never leave reviews but I had to with this recipe and say that, this recipe was way better that I had hoped it would be!!! Like other reviewers I had added and made some of my own adjustments. First, I had only about a pound of boneless pork loin center cut chops that I used for this recipe, which I seasoned with salt, pepper and ground thyme and brown them in a skillet. I also melted a stick of butter in a sauce pan on low heat and mixed in about three diced up apples, salt, pepper, onion powder and a few dashes of hot sauce,  and allowed that to mingle until the butter was completely melted. I also cut a half of a large sweet potato in to thin slices. I layered the slow cooker as follows:  I spread out the sweet potatoes at the bottom, then dumped in a small bag of sauerkraut (juice and all), then dumped in my buttered apples, then spread a mix of horseradish and regular mustard on one side of each of the  the pork loins and spread only horseradish over the other side (since my husband is a lover of horseradish). I only added about a half a cup of chicken stock. By the third hour I was able to tear the pork loin effortlessly with a fork. I did not add onions because I didn't have any, but the meal turned out great! I also made sour cream corn muffins to go on the side or to be eaten for dessert..

i pretty much made it as posted except i didn't measure it, i used bag sauerkraut instead of can so it didn't really have alot of juice..i just took the horseradish mustard and just squirted it and rubbed the pork loin (center cut) til it was smeared all over. i put the onions ,apple, and i put baby carrots on the bottom, poured the sauerkraut in, threw some caraway seeds  in just because thats what i do with sauerkraut..took the recommendation about crushed red pepper and sprinkled that in there..put about 1/3 can of light beer in it plus some low sodium chicken broth, not alot, mixed it up a bit , then put the porkloin on top with pepper, and left it in there for about 6-6.5 hours on low and it turned out great..oh it was a 3.5 lb pork loin. ...my boyfriend loved it , he requested the leftovers tomorrow for lunch.

I like this recipe but I think I would skip (or at least use a lot less) the chicken broth. I would also put more sauerkraut made this into a soup.

This was great, however I could not taste the mustard flavor at all.  Next time I might try searing it with the mustard before putting it in the crock pot.  Due to unplanned circumstances mine ended up in the crock pot for about 10hrs on low, the meat literally fell apart- it was so moist and tender!  The apples and sauerkraut were a surprisingly delicious combination!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was delicious. I would take the recommendation to not add chicken broth. I did a little, but the sauerkraut and juice was enough liquid. Any more than that would have made it too soupy.

John enjoyed it; not so much for me...pork was very tender though.  Be sure to rinse the sauerkraut before putting it in the crockpot.
