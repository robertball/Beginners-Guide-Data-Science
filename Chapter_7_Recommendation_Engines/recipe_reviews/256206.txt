I added a bit more garlic, I was out of bell peppers, and I added some nutritional yeast instead of salt. But everything was delicious!

Looked for a recipe I could use the frozen veggies with. This had good flavor, seasoning. I think it’d be even better (as far as texture) with fresh cauliflower & sweet potato. But with the eggs, it was satisfying!

delicious! I didn't have sriracha sauce so used some chipotle lime sauce and chipotle rub to season. Also used fresh not frozen veggies so prep time took a little longer but worth it. My 11 yr old said he wasn't sure about it when he first saw his dinner but he ended up really liking it! We'll have this again for sure!
