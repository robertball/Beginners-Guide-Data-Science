This was our choice for dinner tonight after leftovers were vetoed by the kids. I plugged in "crescent rolls" and "pepperoni" into the Ingredient Search and this is what I got. I made my own pizza sauce. Very simple and made a fast meal (paired with carrot chips, cucumber slices and broccoli "trees" and a homemade light ranch dip) for an exhausted mom on a tight budget.

neat way to fold into a pocket meal. My kids thought these were pretty good, easy and fast. Loads of possibilities to chang up your pizza pocket. Thanks Pillsbury.

My only complaint is that the sauce and cheese seem to soak into the bread resulting in the need for extra sauce to dip these in. They are fantastic for freezing for quick lunches though, so I will continue making these to try and fix that

We've made this recipe SEVERAL times.  It's one of my husband's favorites.  We plan to try it with homemade crescent rolls too but this is really easy with the canned ones.  Try doing other toppings too like canadian bacon, bacon, sausage, pineapple-whatever you like on a pizza is really good in this.
