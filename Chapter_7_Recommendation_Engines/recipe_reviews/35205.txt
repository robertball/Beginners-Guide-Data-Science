I really like this bread.  I baked it for about 55 minutes and it turned out well.  I didn't add raisins bc half of the dough was made into a pastrami experiment (I halved the recipe to make 2 loaves), and I didn't think pastrami and raisins went well together.  I also used my bread machine to mix the dough since I'm lazy like that.  I really like the end result, but I had to tinker a bit with the amount of water.  It wasn't quite enough at first, so the dough wasn't mixing.  I added about 1/4 c of water.  The dough was a bit sticky at the end bc I accidently added more water than I meant to, but it worked well enough.  I think this bread needs an egg wash; it doesn't come out golden brown at all; just sort of a light tan color that isn't that pretty.  Aside from that, though, I really like the bread.  Fennel is one of my favorite flavors, though--if you don't like it, don't bother.  Thank you for the recipe!  Worth trying again!

I only used half the recipe and the only change I made was dark raisins in place of golden, so I stayed pretty true to the recipe and I was disappointed.  There is too much water and as a result I needed to use 5 3/4 cups of bread flour to even come close to a kneadable dough, which meant the ratio of fennel was off.  Then The tops of the loaves were getting too dark, but the inside wasn't fully baked even though I turned the oven down to 325, so I am hoping I didn't burn out the motor of my mixer and that this toasts up well.
