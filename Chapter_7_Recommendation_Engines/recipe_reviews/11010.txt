I am not a big fan of biscotti, but I am trying to find a nice dessert with a longer shelf life (for gifts) and also something tasty to sell during the holidays.  This is my first attempt at making biscotti & I was a little intimidated.  I am happy to say that making biscotti is so EASY!  I followed the directions of the recipe except I didn't have orange zest.  Instead, I added 1-2 tablespoons of Grand Marnier.  The biscotti was a HUGE hit.  I tested it at a party  & everyone thought I should sell it to Starbucks---so much fresher and tastier!  After mixing the dough, I let it sit in the mixing bowl for 10-12 minutes so that it could set up.  It made it easier to handle (wet hands helped with the stickiness).  Also, I baked the biscotti dough on Silpat sheets and had no problems with sticking.  I used a serrated knife & had no problems slicing the biscotti.  Also, I added a few extra minutes to the second baking because I like a drier biscotti.  I can't wait to experiment with more biscotti recipes!!

These were fantastic! Thanks,Thea. Spreading the chocolate on each cookie was a bit time-consuming, so on my subsequent batches, I laid out all the cooled cookeies, cut side up, on the baking sheet. I put the slightly cooled melted chocolate in a cake decorating bag with a plain tip and "squiggled" it over the cookies.  It was fast, looked great and there was just enough chocolate on each cookie to enhance the orange flavor without overpowering it.

YUM!  I tried to follow the recipe to the letter but I didn't have any oranges.  I used 1/2 tsp. orange extract instead.  Delicious!  Also, after baking, I layed the pieces right next to each other on a wire rack.  Then, I melted the chocolate chips in a ziplock bag, snipped off a very small corner and drizzled the chocolate in patterns over all. Much easier, fancy looking and less cleanup.  I will definitely be giving these as Christmas gifts this year.

This is a great recipe. I have been looking for a good one for a while and I'm so glad I found this one. I didn't have almond extract and I don't care for nutmeg, so I left them out. I also didn't read the recipe really well and added the choc. chips to the batter. Yummy! (I didn't dip them later) Not crazy about orange zest, but it really adds flavor. Don't leave it out - unless of course you are adapting it to a lemon poppy seed biscotti or something like that. The possiblilities are endless! I also only made one large loaf and because I like a real crisp biscotti I turned down the oven to 200 degrees and just let them hang out for about 30 extra minutes at the end. Turned off the oven and let them cool there. Didn't get any darker at 200 either. YUM!

What a change-friendly recipe! I used this recipe on my first shot at making biscotti. I had to leave out almonds due to an allergy, I used anise flavoring instead of the orange zest b/c I did not have any on hand - the anise is my favorite hint of flavor in biscotti so it seemed right. Also I used half whole wheat flour and half AP white flour and THAT really worked too. I normally      to change a recipe so much before trying the original but this is just so forgiving. Oh, the most important part is - EVERYONE loved it. My sunday school class, my mother, my 3yr old daughter, ... I had *Nonni's* biscotti there to (to fall back on just in case mine was terrible) but everyone went for mine first. I love that!  Thank you so much, the recipe is delish! I won't look any further but I will continue to experiment with yours!

Excellent recipe!  Found that the cookies cut much better with a sharp butcher's knife.  The nuts kept sticking to my serated knives (and I tried several) which caused the cookie to break.  The sharp butcher's knife cut them easily and cleanly making a much nicer looking cookie.  Taste is great, Too!

SAVE BIG BUCKS!!!!  I used to purchase my coffee-dunking biscotti by the truckload and at gourmet food prices, it was a guilty pleasure...but NO MORE!!  This biscotti was more dense and subtle in sweetness, and stronger in vanilla taste (yum)than most that I've bought. The best feature is that it certainly proclaims "FRESHLY BAKED".  I will, however, begin to add different things to this fairly basic recipe (such as hazelnut, cocoa, etc) to be able to offer choices to our overnight guests for their breakfast coffee.  The only step I improved upon as I did more and more is the spreading chocolate on the finished biscotti.  I scooped a spoonful, poured it along the bottom side of the biscotti, then scraped it with backside of butterknife to make even, thin layer.  Be sure to let the chocolate set (fridge for 20 min worked well for me).  Mangia!

This is the 3rd AR biscotti recipe I've tried - and the sweetest (also tried "Biscotti" & "Pistachio and Cranberry"). I used fresh orange zest and put the choc chips in the batter (1/2c) so I wouldn't have to mess with dipping afterward. Also I did not toast the almonds. I think the zest and untoasted almonds are too chewy. And choc chips make it too sweet. Smells fantastic and tastes nice, but I didn't reach for a third like I did the others. Will try again with those modifications. Be sure to flatten it out to 1/2" high b4 baking. Yield for me was 48 1/2" pieces.

These are very delicious.  I made the recipe almost as stated, leaving out the almond pieces & just adding 1/2 cup chips.  I then made the recipe again, using oil in place of butter and cinnamon instead of nutmeg.  You really can't taste the cinnamon or nutmeg & can probably leave it out.  My preference is using oil, I like the texture better, but that is personal preference.  This is my new favorite recipe for biscotti  Thank you Thea.

So great! One tip: I add Ghiradelli cocoa powder to half the batch and then, instead of melting chocolate in the microwave, I turn off the oven when the cookies are done baking and place chips on top of cookies and put them back in the oven for a few minutes. They melt nicely and then I run a knife across to smooth the chocolate. It is so much less messy and you won't risk burning the chocolate.

I was in a hurry and didn't read the recipe really well.  I added the chocolate chips to the batter also.  Was really good that way too!  I'm thinking about using dried cranberries in the batter with the toasted almonds and using white chocolate as the topping.. YUM!!!

Very simple recipe with a wonderful flavor.  I added a pinch of cardamom, and it was great.  Also, it works with many variations and is suited for playing around with.   I highly recommend this recipe.

I made this for several christmas presents and i got a TON of complements on it. The only thing I didn't like was that it was more like 'mini' biscotti. But they were still really really good!  Instead of almond extract and almond pieces I used rum extract because I was making it for someone who was allergic and then drizzled them with white and dark chocolate! Super obber good!

I don't understand why people rate this 5 stars and then list all the changes they've made because they had to improve the recipe.  Anyway, I rate it 3 stars because they needed to be in the oven WAY longer than it says in order to get them to be crispy.  One said they lowered the temperature to 200 and let them hang out there for 30 minutes or so.  I think I will do that next time.

Very easy to do, especially for someone who is not a baker! And delicious! We changed the recipe to make it gluten free for my sister, so we did gluten free baking flour by bob's red mill and it turned out great!

These were delicious although it did not yield 42 pcs, more like 20. I had to knock a point off since the dough was difficult to work with. Also, didnt have almond extract so I used rum extract and only 1 tsp of orange zest. with or without chocolate these were amazing!!!

Very easy to make. I didn't have almond extract nor orange zest but they came out tasty anyway. The only problem was with the cooking time - after cutting I baked them over 30 minutes. I might have cut them too thick than required because I got only 24 mid-size pieces. There is no information how wide it should be.

This recipe is absolutely perfect. I want to make biscottis to include in gift baskets for Christmas this year, and these are it!  I had to substitute 1/2 t. of orange extract because i didn't have any oranges on hand for the zest.  Otherwise, I didn't change a thing.  I followed the advice of others, and kept my hands wet with water while working with the dough, and it was just fine.  The dough didn't stick to me at all using this tip.  Thanks, THEA!

Okay...So I didn't have any Nutmeg or Almonds but what are ya gonna' do?! Once cooled, I spread some with melted chocolate and sprinkled chopped Hazelnuts on top and drizzled chocolate over the others. Then I popped them in the freezer for a few minutes to set. They are absolutely delicate and delicious! I love biscotti and these have that perfect subtle taste. I did bake mine slightly longer the second time around (about 8 mins per side) because I like my biscotti really crunchy. Can't wait to share with friends and family, I know they'll be impressed!

This recipe is delicious!! I am a college student with limited cooking skills and a big sweet tooth. I used a little more orange zest than called for, as well as used blanched almonds instead of toasted almonds. Use caution when cutting the loaves. Using the serrated knife is important for this. This recipe didn't make 42 servings though, maybe 20-30.

This is very good and easy to make. I will definitely be making biscotti again, trying some of the variations on this site.  I used the fresh zest from 1 med. size orange instead of the 2 t., which I assume meant dried.  I think that would have been a little much. Also, I mistakenly used raspberry flavored choc. chips. It was ok, but next time I'll be sure to look at the package and use plain choc. chips. The 1/2 c. of chips was way too much, imo, so next time I will cut it down to 1/4c. Even the almonds could be cut down, if you are running low, but over all, it's a great recipe!!

I make these for a friend for her birthday and Christmas every year~she says she can't buy store-bought biscotti anymore!  The only change I make is instead of dipping the biscotti into chocolate, I add about 1/3 cup semi-sweet mini chocolate chips to the mix when I add the almonds.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These are the best biscotti ever. Easy to make too. I substituted anise extract for the almond and 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour for same amount white. Also spread chocolate on top of cookie with chopped almonds - very easy to be creative with this cookie. Superb!

This was wonderful! made it 2 days in a row.  Had to freeze some before hubby ate all of them. First day I used orange zest; next day I used lemon zest - just as good.  Also threw in some anise seed I had & craisins.  You can add chips directly to the mix, about 1/2 cup.  Just use 1 long or 2 spatulas when removing the loaves from the oven to the racks to cool.   TIP - these look even more elegant if you DIP the BOTTOM of the biscotti into melted chocolate instead of the side.  I used a small rectangle container & microwaved the chips (about 2 min).  Dip the bottoms into the chocolate & just use tip of spatula to even it out.  Lay on their sides on a plate or cooling rack & put in fridge for about 10 mins to firm up.

excellent! came out perfect, and this is the first time I've made biscotti. my parents loved it, and i have made variations in the flavourings, i have tried lemon zest, subtle but still good, and cinnamon and nutmeg came out nicely. I am going to add fruit to another batch instead of almonds, and also hazelnuts in a different batch. my favourite is still the original :)
Only problem I had was the second cooking time took longer, I'd say cook them for 9 minutes, and then flip, then do 6 minutes on the other side.
THANKS FOR THE RECIPE

This was a very easy to make biscotti recipe. It was my first time making it and I modified it by adding pecans and chocolate chips to the batter. Absolutely delicious! Also, I did not have orange zest, so I subbed orange marmalade and it still turned out great. I baked them at 275 for an additional 15 minutes to make them extra crispy. Thank you!

good. I thought the recipe should be doubled. Wet your hands before forming a loaf. I put cranberries in mine and omitted the almonds.

These are beyond good, and easy enough that even a hack like me can't screw them up too badly.  I've made these twice now.  The first time, I didn't make the dough long and narrow, and so I ended up with thin, really long cookies that tasted very good, but didn't really look like biscotti.  I also didn't have almonds that time.  Still good.  Don't roll them out too thin, and I'd say it's safe to go about 3.5-4" high and 10-12" long.  I rolled them between wax paper and transferred them to the pan.  Okay, second time, I made them the right shape (remembering to cut diagonally) and added almonds.  I do my zest on a cheese grater (the bigger of the small grating ones like you'd use for parmesan) and 2 tsp is a whole orange's worth for me.  I tried melting the chocolate in a micro safe bowl and ended up burning it, and putting a big hole in my rubbermaid container.  (This is likely my fault and not something that'd happen to everyone).  Anyway, I decided again not to add the chocolate, and I can honestly say that I don't miss it.  These cookies are light and fresh and perfect with coffee.  Thank you so much - I'm going to be a hit at coffee hour after church tomorrow!

ETA:  Third time around and they were even better!  I did whole almonds (instead of sliced) this time, and next time I'm going to toast them first).  We dipped and/or drizzled them with melted chocolate bark and it was awesome.

This is by far the best recipe I have ever made. The very first time I ever made biscotti I used this recipe and it turned out great. It's also good as a base for alterations. I've made marble biscotti out of this by splitting the dough in half, mixing in melted chocolate into one half, then rolled them into thick tubes which I twisted around each other and baked as normal. Cut on a diagonal (opposite the twist) and they turn out great!

This was the best biscotti I have ever tasted!!! I didn't use the chocolate drizzle, because it was perfect without it. Next time, I am going to use lemon zest and cinnamon and see how that turns out :) Definately a 5 star recipe!!

Perfect base recipe!  Though I didn't try it as is for starters I really didn't do much.  I used 1/2c of chopped pistachios and 1/2c chopped dried cranberries. In addition to the almond extract I added about 1/8tsp of orange extract too and I skipped the nutmeg.  Didn't drizzle chocolate on all of them because they were just SO delicious as they were.  Seriously some of the most scrumptious biscotti I've ever eaten!

Great Recipe! All the flavors added are the perfect amount and blend so well together. I did use pecans in place of the almonds because I had some that needed used up. I also added dried cranberries and I love the texture and flavor they added. I did use the chocolate but I think I prefer them without it. You kind of miss out on all the other flavors going on because the chocolate tends to overpower them. This really was easy to make and filled the house with such a wonderful comforting smell.

These were great and very easy to make!  Instead of dipping them in chocolate chips, I bought some Godiva dipping chocolate bars at Sam's Club and dipped the ends of the biscotti into the chocolate.  They were delicious and I brought them to a cookie exchange where everyone raved about them.  Make sure to use a sharp, serrated knife.

I love this recipe!  It is the easiest and quickest biscotti recipe I've ever tried.  And there are so many ways to vary the flavors successfully - I've never made the same type twice.  This one is a keeper.

Great, easy recipe.  I used dark chocolate chips, put a little bit of orange zest in the chocolate before I melted it then dipped one side in it instead of brushing or drizzling it on. Delish!

I love the flavor of these biscotti but several of mine broke when slicing.  I followed the recipe exactly and followed the cooking times.  Once cooled and when slicing several of these broke apart.  That doesn't matter as far as taste is concerned because these taste fantastic.  If these hadn't broke it would be a 5 star recipe.

This is very good and easy to make.  Some of the almond pieces got in the way when I was slicing and made chunks of cookie break off. Next time, I'll probably use sliced almonds instead. Also will use more almond extract and skip the vanilla as I couldn't taste the almond at all. I used 3/4 c. of the choc. chips and it was still way too much. I ended up dipping pretzel rods in the remaining chocolate and almost covered a whole bag! Next time, I'll use 1/4-1/3 c. but I will be making this again.

I love this recipe and have made it many times now. I always keep a batch on hand in a big cannister and dip one into my latte every morning. I'm a purist, so I skip the chocolate altogether, and I double the almond extract. Also, to avoid having to turn it over half-way through the second baking, I put the slices on top of a cooling rack, which I put on top of a cookie sheet. Yummy! Makes a great holiday gift, too.

made a few changes but still turned out pretty well.
-used half whole wheat.
-switched almonds for cranberries.
-switched orange zest for orange peel.
-didnt have almond extract
the flavor came out good, but they weren't as crisp as i would have liked. i think i should have used all a.p. flour and baked for longer than 25 min. be sure to cut the slices thinner if you want more crisp. i think cinnamon would be a nice addition. 
also, i melted choclate chips into a ziploc bag with a cut corner to nicely squeeze/drizzle chocolate over my biscotti. looked very nice.

We were having an Italian dinner fundraiser at school & I was asked to pick up biscotti at the bakery (since no one knew how to make them).  Then I remembered I had printed this recipe a while ago & figured I could use a little baking therapy :)  If they came out bad, I could still go to the bakery.  Not to worry...these were sooooo good!  I didn't have any almond extact, so I left it out.  I did add some ground up anise seeds becuase that is my favorite taste in the biscotti.  I left half plain & half with chocolate.  They were the first dessert to go at the dinner & everyone raved over them.  I was so proud!  I think the orange zest made them even better.  Great recipe!  We used to get a box of homemade biscotti every year at Christmas from a 93 year old client and since he passed away, I  have been wishing I knew how to make them and now I do!  Thank you!!!!

I've made biscotti using other recipes before and this one is the keeper. The dough is stickier than other recipes I've used in the past, but perhaps that is why (although the cookies are hard, as they should be) no one will break a tooth on the finished product :) The only modification I made was to use 1 tsp each of vanilla and almond extracts. Thanks!

On accident I added the chocolate chips to the recipe instead of dipping the biscotti in the melted chocolate after baking.  Yummy combination of flavors.  Will make again.

Absolutely delicious!!!  I omitted the nutmeg, and added a smidge more almond and vanilla extract.  Dipping the finished biscotti in semisweet chocolate, and then rolling in crushed toffee makes all the flavors come together perfectly.

This recipe is superb! I didn't have any orange zest, but the flavor was still superb. I dipped mine in dark chocolate and coated with sliced almonds. These were so wonderful, I can't wait to impress my friends! And, so easy. The dough was sticky, so I had to keep dipping my hands in flour. Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm a young man in the building trades.  I looked this recipe up in an attempt to save money by baking a large quantity of biscotti on an off sunday which I could eat throughout the week.  It works out great... not only do I save a considerable amount of money, but I actually like this biscotti better than the stuff I was buying at the store!

I added 1/2 cup more of flour, and grand marnier instead of orange flavor. I also toasted my almonds and added 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of cloves. Brushed the top with milk before putting in oven.

These were kind of just ok for me. Didn't taste like the biscotti I know. But they looked pretty (I drizzled chocolate on them and put mini chocolate chips in the batter) and they were ok taste-wise. Very mild. Perhaps too mild for me. Needs a little more flavor. Perhaps some anise? I will make them again but will tinker with the recipe a bit.

I always wanted to try biscotti, but every time someone else made it, it came out to be more like a soft cookie.  I wanted that crispy texture.  This was my first attempt.  I have never had a more delicious and more perfect of a texture in a biscotti!! The orange zest was key.  I was worried when splitting up the dough.  It's sticky and not easy to form like a pizza dough would be.  I honestly thought I did something wrong.  I went ahead and continued thinking I had a disaster awaiting me.  Instead I found the loaves perfect and easy to remove to cool, easier to cut and by the time I stuck them in for the final crisping, I knew I was on the right track.  I dipped them in the melted chocolate on one flat side and scraped the top along the bowl to smoothe it out.  Some I drizzled the chocolate, some I left plain and others I added sprinkles to the chocolate.  They were ALL delicious!  I plan to make these often.

EXCELLANT biscotti recipe. I make the basic recipe and them divide dough and vary added ingredients for a little variety. I tried several biscotti recipes in past and this is THE BEST by far. As a matter of fact it is the only recipe I will probably ever use for biscotti again!

Fantastic!  Very versatile recipe.  I have made biscotti many times before and (as I am Italian-American) was raised on homemade biscotti; and I must say this was an extremely simple recipe (though biscotti usually is).  It was simple to modify, simple to work with.  This recipe would be great as is, but I was missing the nuts.  I used 3/4 t vanilla extract, 3/4 almond extract, zest of 2 medium oranges, and a little more than a 1/4 c semi-sweet choc chips in place of the nuts.  These will be going to my kids' teachers for christmas along with some other cookies.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I made the mistake of baking them about 25 minutes on the second baking and they turned out like DUST!  I didn't lower the temperature of the oven though.  I baked the recipe again and followed the timings exactly and they were DELICIOUS!  Only thing is, they definitely aren't as hard/dry as biscotti usually are.  I will try experimenting again to get them drier to see which ones I prefer.  They are great as they are though (and still dunkable!)

I have never cared for Biscotti but after my girlfriend saw it made on TV and said she had never even heard of it I decided to make her some. This recipe was fantastic, not only was it easy to do, it tasted great! The only changes I made was to add a dash of cinnamon, a lot more almond extract and sliced almonds and no chocolate. I made these cookies for my 9 year old daughters Girl Scout troop and drizzled with chocolate and they loved them too. Who knew kids would like what I consider such a grownup cookie :) Strongly recommend as a jumping base for any biscotti, will make again.

This really tasted alot like cardboard.  Maybe it was the changes that I made but the cooking time adjustments I had to make surely wasn't me.  My oven is usually pretty accurate.  I substituted splenda for the sugar. I didn't have the orange zest so I substituted liquid orange extract.  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon.  The dough was so dry that I had to add about 1/4 cup of liquid, I used coffee.  When I baked it I had to add 15 minutes cooking time the first time and doubled the cooking time the second time.  In a word Yuk!

This is great without the chocolate chips.  I make it with whole wheat flour and Splenda baking mix for a less guilty breakfast treat.

This is my second year around making these for holiday gifts.  This year, they never made it to gift giving before they were gone!  The dough is very stiff but a big, powerful mixer works well.  Otherwise, easy to make, substitutes can be made for more, less or different flavors.  One batch had tangerine zest, another lime, another none but more almond flavoring.  Almonds, cashews, walnuts, no nuts. ALL of them had milk chocolate, white bark or a combination of the two drizzled over them.  The BEST biscotti recipe I have ever tried.  Look no further if you haven't made biscotti before - this is it.

many have told me they love my biscotti for a long time.i think they were just afraid to try to make it themselves! my recipe was an "old italian" one from a dear friend's mom. however, i decided to try this one because it seemed easier. oh my goodness! it's not only the easiest recipe i've used, but it's great tasting, looks beautiful, and can be adapted to include a variety of different flavors. i made the recipe four times in a row one evening, because i didn't want to multiply the ingredients and perhaps change the perfect consistency. it was perfect each time and actually became easier. thanks for sharing this one.

So easy and delicous.  I threw everything into my Kitchen Aid and it came out great.  You'll need to wet your hands to work the dough but other than that this Biscotti Recipe is fantastic.  I'll keep using this basic recipe and try adding other ingredients like, coconut, dried cranberries etc.

I've never made biscotti before today, and these were wonderful even though I made some substitutions based on my tastes and what I had around the house.  I used hazelnuts instead of almonds, cinnamon instead of nutmeg, and omitted the orange zest.  The result: beautiful golden brown, mildly sweet and crisp (but not dry) cookies.  I dipped some of them in melted chocolate chips and rolled them in finely chopped hazelnuts . . . delicious!

I made a batch without the almond extract or almonds because we didn't have any at home at the time, and it was still very good.  The flavor of the orange zest really came through.  I later picked up the missing ingredients, and made another batch.  This time I coarsely ground up the almonds and sprinkled them on top of the chocolate, for a nice look.  It was very tasty.  Thanks for the recipe, Thea!

THis was the first time making Biscotti.  It was wonderful. My friend said that it was "gift worthy".  I found that it was easy to make, and they turned out perfectly.  I used less orange zest than called for- and they are perfect.  Just what I have been wanting without paying those prices for store bought ones.

I've gotten rave reviews from everyone who sampled these biscotti. I also added some toasted hazelnuts to the batter and a little orange flavoring to the chocolate before dipping them.

This is an excellent cookie.  The chocolate is a nice addition.  If you liked this recipe you should try the others in 'Biscotti', a little cook book by Lou Seibert Pappas.  It was published in 1992, but it's still available on Amazon. Check it out.

I come from an Italian family, so I've grown up eating different biscotti's from the ladies in our family. Well, I wanted to make them myself one day and came across this one. I LOVE IT! And guess what? So did my Nonna, who isn't one for trying anything not from her recipe book. She asks me to make them with her all the time for weddings and company. She loves them! And that's saying something from an old-school Italian. Sometimes when I don't have orange zest I use lemon juice and they still taste great! You can really change these up if you want to. A keeper!

Very simple.  Very good!  I made my own flavor variation - almond coconut - and it was very good.  I took another reviewer's advice and formed the logs using a sheet of wax paper.  Super simple and no mess!

A good recipe to practice with. My first try wasn't very refined nor cut up very pretty. And it takes some time to figure how your oven bakes (or doesn't) at this lower temp. I think blending the ingredients with an electric  hand mixer helps the consistency. Don't worry about making the "loaves" pretty, it's in the angled cutting. Decorating with the chocolate is the easiest part.

First time to make biscotti and I was intimidated. This recipe was easy to follow and tasted great. The slight orange taste with chocolate was great.

These were delicious.  I was scared because the dough was incredibly crumbly but they turned out wonderfully!  Thank you!  Subbed in some orange oil for the zest.

These are incredible! I made these for Thanksgiving, and I could barely stop eating them. I first was skeptical of the ingredients because I usually don't bake with zest of any kind, but this time (becuase I had oranges on handy) I went ahead and inclueded zest as indicated. No regrets! The almond and orange flavor work perfectly together - and it smells so good while and after it bakes! I don't even want to put chocolate on it...I feel that anything extra would just take away from its already amazing flavor. You must try this!

I'm sure if I'd followed the recipe it would have been perfect.  I put the chocolate chips into the dough.  Then when I read the recipe after baking since it was so crumbly I saw that the chocolate chips were supposed to be melted for the outside.  Doh!!  They are still good though.

This Biscotti was fantastic! I did not have oranges to make orange zest, so I used orange extract instead and it tasted great. It got rave reviews and it was extremely easy to make. 

I also made a batch without toasted almonds for those who do not like nuts, and those came out great too! :)

I always double and sometimes triple this recipe.  It is fantastic!  Sometimes I even brush melted chocolate on the side.  I've made this recipe for years and it's always a holiday favorite.

I used to work at an Italian restaurant, and the owner’s father would come in with his old friends on Thursdays. I used to bake these at home and bring them in and they loved them!
Like some of the other reviewers said, I do not put all of that chocolate on the biscotti-- sometimes a do drizzle a little on using a Ziploc bag with the corner cut out.  But I love the flavor without it, and so does every one else I have made them for.  Also, I use whole almonds (I probably use more like a cup), and I like to cook them a little longer to make sure they are quite tan.

Ah!  This is the biscotti I was hoping for.  I recently purchased some rather expensive, very thin biscotti with fruit & nuts & loved them.  After reading lots of reviews for this recipe, I made it, slicing one loaf into very thin slices before the second baking.  They're better than the store-bought.  Easy to make, no exotic ingredients--these are going to be a frequent event at our house!

these are great. I didn't use the chocolate (since I was also making some choc/pecan biscotti), so I increased sugar to 1 cup. Excellent!

Quick & easy in my Kitchenaid mixer.  Mixed in 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips instead of spreading with chocolate.  Forgot to toast almonds and next time I'll add a few more minutes to second bake - some dried cherries might be nice too.

Very crunchy and tasty.  I used tangerine zest and maple extract instead of orange zest and almond extract, it was even better!!!

I thought these were very tasty eventhough I had no nutmeg and didn't use the chocolate coating. The orange zest added a nice touch. I also like my biscotti rather hard, so I baked them a bit longer than the recipe called for.

Great recipe.  Did it twice; first time around, biscotti were somewhat too dry, so I decreased oven time to 8 min. (got a tricky oven!) and added more zest along with  1 teaspoon of orange liqueur.  A real hit!

I've made this recipe a couple of times now, and every time I change it a little, sometimes adding more orange zest, almods, etc. And every time I great great reviews from friends and family! This is definitely one of the best biscotti recipes out there. It may take a while to make on your first go, but like any recipe, you'll speed up the process when you get to know it better!

This was a great recipe and easy to make!!  I didn't use the  orange zest because I didn't have any.  I also omitted the chocolate chips because I dipped one end in choclate and then rolled in almonds, pecans, walnuts, or toffee chips.

I tried 3 different biscotti recipes from this site, and Biscotti Toscani made the best base for a variety of flavors.  I made the recipe as is, and also left out the orange peel and made a batch of coconut cranberry, and another batch of cinnamon walnut.  I've made biscotti for many years, and this biscotti recipe cuts more smoothly (without breaking or crumbling) before the 2nd baking.

The flavors are beautiful! It was my own fault though that they crumbled when slicing - I baked for the 25min but that wasn't long enough (maybe oven's temp is off?) since they were still soft and kinda fell apart. So on the 2nd baking, I just gave each "side" 10min each. I gave up spreading the chocolate on the sides since crumbs kept getting in the way of a smooth veneer, so I drizzled the chocolate w/ a spoon & fork --> chilled. Even w/o the chocolate they were yummy. FYI: I used all the ingredients exactly.

This recipe is out of this world.  I even goofed up by not reading the directions all the way through and stirred the minature chocolate chips into the dough. The orange zest is essential.  These get better tasting every day stored in a glass jar.  I will be making this recipe over and over.

The biscotti turned out great, however, next time I will either dip the biscotti
or not use the chocolate at all because spreading it on with a spatula was
messy and unattractive.  I agree with adding more almond extract for 
more almond flavour.  Very tasty though and relatively simple to make!

This turned out very well! I admit for some reson mking biscotti was a bit intimidating, but all in all it was quite easy to make. The ingredients were basic. I didn't use oragne zest only becasue I didn't have an orage on hand, but it didn't need it anyhow. I will try it next time, but it still tastes fine without it. These were very tasty amd I will make hem again!

This was the first biscotti I had ever made and I found it very simple and quick. I did not use the orange rind and thought they were better without the melted chocolate. The only problem was that the dough stuck to the counter as I shaped the logs. I had to scrape the logs off with a knife.

Oh my gosh! I have never made biscotti before and thought I might give it a try. It was wonderful. This is a great recipe! It was so easy to make. I made them Lime, Ginger and Coconut. I wanted to put white chocolate on them, but I didn't have any. Thank you so much for this awesome recipe.

Delicious biscotti, although I had a really hard time cutting the loaves to get 42 biscotti, I probably only got about half that.  I also added about 1Tbsp. of orange zest and 1/2 tsp. orange extract to the batter, and drizzled white chocolate over top, this gave them great flavor.  They are a little tricky to make, but overall I liked them much more then the store bought biscotti.

I susstituted maple flavoring for the extracts and used chopped black walnuts. Taste was mild but a little fragile between the first and second baking. Also I am going to try baking 10 minutes each side for the second baking to make them firmer.

This cookie tastes very good but I will make a few changes for next time. Instead of making the loaves 1/2 inch high, I think 1 - 2 inches would work a lot better to give that traditional biscotti shape. Otherwise, this was very easy and good.

This was the first biscotti recipe I had ever tried, so I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I loved them!  Very tasty.  I've made them several times since.

This recipe is really good- a yummy, simple Biscotti! I have one suggestion- when you are cutting the biscotti after it has baked the first time, use a pizza cutter. You'll get a cleaner cut, and your biscottis will look more professional!

Great recipe! The only thing I didn't have was an orange to zest so I skipped that. I made these for gifting this Christmas and everybody loved it! So wonderful to dip into a hot cup of coffee :)

These are very tasty. The plain dough was very yummy, easy to whip up by hand and easy to enjoy. Seems very versatile and is perfect for someone (me!) who's never made biscotti before.

I liked these pretty well.  I give them 4 stars because the dough was a little sticky and hard to work with, and they were a little too sweet.  I think I'll cut down on the sugar just a tad next time.

These were a big hit.  My husband kept sneaking back to the jar and before we know it they were all gone.  Luckily our son and daughter-in-law got to try them too and both loved them also.  I am on my way to the store to stock up on ingredients so that I can have them on hand for the family and friends for the holidays.

This is a great recipe, made delicious biscotti! I didn't have any nutmeg on hand so I used ground cardamom instead, it turned out nicely, but next time I will make sure to use the nutmeg, like the recipe calls for. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of biscotti unless I'm dunking it, and having this alongside a mug of steaming hot chai tea is the perfect afternoon snack!

Unbelievable!  The only substitution I made was orange liquor for orange zest.  Biscotti came out crisp yet chewy.  Definitely a keeper recipe.

I added 2 TBSP Hazelnut liqueur, 1 tsp orange extract instead of the zest I didn't have, and omitted the nutmeg and almond extract since I had none in my kitchen. They are superbly tasty, but mine are still a bit soft in the middle. They probably just need to bake longer. YUM! :D

I have attempted making biscotti before, but was never happy with the results, until now.  These are wonderful biscotti with excellent texture and taste.  I did change a few things.  I added 1/2 tsp. instant espresso to the mix and decreased the almond flavoring to 1/8 tsp.  I also mixed in 1 c. chopped dark chocolate and topped them with almond slices.  Very yummy, I plan to serve them with home made vanilla ice cream

This is an extremely forgiving recipe!  It's not very finicky about the amount of time spent kneading the dough.  I used just almond extract, and brown sugar and lemon zest (I didn't have an orange). I topped it with a syrup of milk, brown sugar, almond extract, disorono and chocolate chips.  I did cook and cool it for longer than suggested.  Cheers!

These turned out perfectly and none broke!!  I used the Grand Mariner orange liquor instead of the orange zest and the flavor was great!  Next time I'll have to double it!

I highly recommend this recipe for a nice light dessert.  Since I'm rather fond of the combination of orange and chocolate flavors, I added orange extract to really bring out that flavor.  I also drizzled the chocolate rather than spread it for a more elegant look.

Delicious!  The dough was really sticky to build into a loaf, so a lot of flour or something on the hands is needed.  Besides that I can't think of anything to say but, Yummy!

Loved this! I made without the orange, my daughter did not want the orange on this day. I changed it a bit by adding additional vanilla and iced it with both chocolate and white icing. In fact it was so good I was offered to make for a local resturant when I gave it to the owner/a friend. Thanks for the recipe! I will continue to use as a base and add and change to make more diversity.

This were just OK. I really thought the almond extract and orange zest would make them fantastic, but no. I used the orange zest in a spice bottle, maybe fresh orange zest would have been better. I dunno, but I will keep looking. Oh, and you have to cook these way longer than the recipe calls for, but I have found that to be true with both recipes I have tried recently. I just turned the oven down to 250 and checked on them every 10 minutes until they were done.

I have only made biscotti twice and this recipe was fantastic!  I personally enjoy the almond and citrus flavors together - I didn't have time to put the chocolate on but they were still delicious.  Also, I forgot to put the almonds in which would have been tasty, but again it is a solid recipe alone even if one forgets certain items (as I tend to do).  I gave these as Christmas gifts this year which worked nicely because they are not as heavy as the more traditional christmas cookies but still feel like a treat when you are eating them.

This is my favorite biscotti recipe and I've tried at least a dozen. They are crisp and light, not hard or crumbly.  My only changes: I add a little more orange zest and drizzle on the chocolate very lightly instead of slathering it on.

Easy and tasty.  Perfect texture but easy to cut to size.  Would definitely make again!

LOVED the flavor!  I didn't quite have enough orange zest, but it still gave a great flavor.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they didn't come out as crisp as I'd like, even my husband commented on that.  So my next batch I'll experiment with oven temps and baking time to get the right amount of crispiness.

I think I am addicted to these biscotti.  I leave out the almond extract and the almonds because I usually don't have them.  I also leave them in the oven for a little longer than instructed.  I always have these around the house because they are simply heavenly with hot chocolate or herbal fruit tea.  Thanks for the recipe!

The orange zest really added flavour.  I got nowhere near 3 1/2 dozen...maybe a dozen and a half, but still good nontheless.

hands down the best-tasting biscotti recipe EVER!!  i really think that the combination of orange/vanilla/almond flavors sets this recipe apart from other recipes.  i replaced the almonds with pecans and added raisens to the batter.  i haven't dipped the biscotti in chocolate yet, but i'm sure that that will make it even better.

These were wonderful! The orange zest lifted the flavor to another level. I will definately be making them again, they were a bit of work, but it was worth it and they keep for a really long time.

I loved this biscotti!! The aroma of the batter alone indicated to me that it would be wonderful, and sure enough it was! I added in walnuts instead of almonds, and also added in some cinnamon, white chocolate chips and milk chocolate chips (instead of melting and dipping like the recipe indicated). The texture is wonderful as well! Thank you Thea for this recipe!

I thought these were very good. I put the half cup of chocolate chip in the batter instead of melting it and putting on the outside. I will make again, maybe try it without the orange zest.

We loved this recipe.  I left out the nuts due to an allergy and put mini chocolate chips in the batter.  Delicious!  My mother-in-law took most of them home with her.

I was skeptical that I would find a biscotti recipe that came close to the store bought ones we like, but these are really good and used ingredients we already have at home.  I added an extra tsp of orange zest.  Thanks for a great recipe that I will make over and over!

This is a keeper. Very easy and made beautiful cut. I drizzled them with semi-sweet chocolate and confectioner sugar's icing. Taste so good. Although my brother said that it's a bit floury, but I still love them.

This recipe is very versatile regarding the ingredients you can add to change the flavor.  I have tried other recipes, but this one is the best! I usually make these biscotti to give as gifts, but most of the time they end up as a gift for myself...they are so good! Most recently I used no chocolate, but flavored mine with hazelnuts and the almond extract.  YUMMY!

This recipe is fabulous!  I've used it in the past and again just tonight for my Easter dinner contribution.  The taste, appearance and texture is superb!  The orange zest is just the right amount and although I left off the chocolate, this biscotti holds its own!  LOVE IT!

I've tried many biscotti recipes and I always come back to this one. It's PERFECT!!! I usually coat one side of the biscotti with dark chocolate and sprinkle flaked almonds on it. Looks great and tastes even better!!!

Wonderful!

I always leave out the orange zest though and I do not use as much flour as the recipe calls for (the dough got too dry on my first attempt).  I dip one of the long flat sides in chocolate and then sprinkle the wet chocolate with almond bits (or you can use white choclate drizzled over the dark chocolate) for a pretty affect.

So easy to make!  Don't need to buy those dried out store bought biscotti no more.  Chocolate was a nice touch, though I didn't have enough for all the cookies I made.  Must have cut them too thin!

This was both easy and good. My whole family liked it, but it is still not quite what I was looking for. I think it might have been a little dense for me.  I want hard, which this was, but a little lighter.

If we do again we'll dip in white choc, milk choc or not dip at all. Also would change vanilla to 3/4 tsp & almond to 1/2 tsp as we thought the almond taste should come out more.

These came out pretty good. I added a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips to the cookie mix instead of melting it. I used sliced  almonds, I didn't use almond extract or the zest. I used 2 tsp of pure vanilla extract. All in all these were easy. This was my second attemot this year to make biscotti's. They are alot better then the first ones that i made. I would next time try to dip them. an maybe add the almond extract to it.

These were good.  They really smell good when they're baking -- the almond and the orange aroma.  I think I might cut back on the orange next time -- a little strong.  I'll make these again.

This is my first time making biscotti and it turned out REALLY well.  Be careful when you cut the pieces, they may crumble a bit.  It helps if you use a long serrated knife.  A friend's co-worker said "She must be Italian!"

This is the first biscotti that I baked--the quantity  of the ingredients was perfect and the biscotti came out well, had a delicate flavour and everyone loved it--and I plan to make this on a regular basis.

I made these biscotti and did like them.  But instead of trying to figure out the 1/3 c butter , i just used 6 tbls.  It was much easier to make it that way.  They were very good.  I didnt use the zest because we dont care for zest in biscotti.  I used 1/2 cup of chopped almonds .....thanks for the recipe.  Also drizzled chocolate zig zag across the top of them.

I've tried several biscotti recipes and this is now my go-to. I follow the recipe nearly exactly, with great results. I do skip the chocolate - they're great without and I prefer it that way with coffee and for storage.

The texture of the dough is fantastic.  I did another dose but added a shot of espresso and more flour to balance the extra liquid from the espresso

I make quite a bit of biscotti and often tweak the recipe depending on what I add instead of chocolate chips. I used heath pieces (1 c) and added cinnamon instead of nutmeg. The recipe is much drier than any other I made. I decided to stick with it and see the end result. Forming the log was difficult and it started to crack as soon as I patted it out. However, it came out and cut just fine although it's a little more 'cakey' and soft in the middle. Second bake was 10 minutes, flip, 10 more minutes (I like them dry).  Final result is a nice firm texture that soaks up coffee quick. Tasted sweet enough for me. Giving it 4 stars just because I do think it needs s little more butter. *Tip for cutting: Don't 'saw' with your knife. Put the tip down on the back and push the handle down. I use my bread knife.

I made a modified version of this recipe that omitted the almond extract and almonds (migraine trigger for me), and skipped the chocolate drizzle. Instead, I added half a cup of multi-colored sprinkles to the mix. Our neighbors loved getting rainbow biscotti as part of their plate of Christmas cookies this year.

I followed the recipe but did not care for it. The biscotti are good for dunking in coffee just to give it some flavor. Probably won't be making these again unless I make some serious changes.

This is a really classic kind of biscotti. It's got a lot of flavour but isn't too strange and complicated. I prefer, instead of drizzling chocolate over top, mixing mini semisweet chocolate chips right into the dough and baking them in. The mixture of almond slivers and chocolate chips gives the biscotti a nice look and texture.

i used the recipe as a start for a basic biscotti.  i left out the orange zest and almonds and substituted butterscotch chips for the chocolate.  It turned out very well.  I would like to do it again and leave the almonds in and still do the butterscotch,  i think it would be a bit toffee/almond brickle-ish.

Great and easy to follow recipe.  I  followed the recipe exactly and the dough was perfect.  I increased the bake time by a few minutes during the first time in the oven,  but had them in the secind time for exactly 10 minutes - for 5 mintutes on each side.  Easy and good recipe for baking as gifts.  Next time I will add dried cranberries.

First time making biscotti and I am very glad I used this recipe.  I followed it exactly and the biscotti are FANTASTIC!  I wouldn't change a thing about it.  My only words of wisdom would be that the amount of orange zest needed was about all of the zest from one naval orange and when forming the biscotti loaves if you shape the ends diagonally you will waste less when you slice the loaves later.

This is an excellent recipe as-is and it is also a very good base to use for experimentation.  I replaced the almond extract with peppermint and replaced the orange zest with crushed candy cane and made delicious candy cane biscotti.

They were still a little soft after baking for the recommended time and could've been sweeter but they are adequate baked treats to serve with coffee or tea.

I used this recipe as a base to try out some different flavors of biscotti to use up holiday baking leftovers. The dough came out much firmer than I expected, and I suspect that it might have been better to flatten it more; it rose more than I thought it would during the first baking. Also, 5 minutes on each side during the second baking didn't seem to be enough. After turning them over, I raised the heat to 350. I made butterscotch mocha and cherry anise (half batch of each, as a test), and they came out very nicely. Fun experience.

Very good!  This was my first time making biscotti, and they weren't as rock-hard as most other versions I've had.  I spread the chocolate on the bottoms rather than the sides and baked them a bit longer than directed (9 min one side, about 6 on the other, then turned the oven off and left it ajar for a little over an hour), but otherwise followed directions exactly.  Will make again.

These came out great! I didn't have any orange zest and put in a little triple sec instead. They had good texture, nice mild flavor: perfect for dipping into coffee. I'll try with orange zest next time. Maybe it'll be a 5 star then. Thanks.

Easy to make and worked well.  Just not as much flavor as I would of liked.  Next time I might try more extract or adding fruit or chocolate?

For some unknown reason, my melted cholate chips never set again.  The flavor is wonderful, but my husband didn't care for the orange zest much.

Fabulous and crunchy and delish! A little more effort than the "usual" drop cookies, but the biscottis are way worth it!

I've made biscotti before w/ anise that was well like by family and friends, but this is first time that I've actually eaten my own stuff and like it! Would recc following the recipe as is; the orange zest makes it taste and smell fresh.  Great with tea or coffee!!

This is very good. I followed the recipe almost exactly (accidentally poured in a bit extra almond extract) and it turned out really well. I've been giving these (plus a few other types of biscotti) for Christmas gifts this year.

I didn't know people made biscotti!  I thought you bought it at the store.  This is just wonderful!  I added more orange zest because I like the flavor and I used Hershey's Dark Chocolate Chips for the glaze because I like dark chocolate more than anything.  I didn't find it to be too much trouble to glaze the biscotti.  The only problem was, I ate most of them while glazing them.  Next time, I'll definitely double the recipe.  Too easy and too good!

Ohhhhhhh, these are good. We made these tonight with the intention of giving them as little holidays gifts to teachers and friends. I don't think they're going to last that long! The only change we made was instead of semi-sweet choc chips, we used orange-flavored milk chocolate purchased from Whole Foods bulk. I think this really enhanced the other orange ingredients. I feel another batch of these coming on....

the flavor of these cookies are fantastic! however mine turned out way too soft but i think that might have something to do with the butter substitute i used.

This was my first time making biscotti, and it was much easier than I thought it would be.  I left out the orange zest and drizzled the chocolate on top instead of spreading it on the bottom.  My husband loved these!  I'm looking forward to making these for gifts.

I've made this several times now - always doubling the recipe - and it is a winner! Great with or without the chocolate chips.  I usually dip them in white chocolate but they are also great plain. I made a bunch last Christmas and packaged them in air-tight jars.  With a little holiday ribbon they make a great hostess gift or to have on hand when you need an extra little gift.  Thanks Thea for taking the time to post the recipe.

This is a very good biscotti recipe.  I left out the orange peel and increased the almond extract to 1 tsp.  I only used half the amount of chocolate topping and there was still a little left over.

I wanted just a basic recipe for biscotti, so used this and eliminated the flavours (almond extract, orange zest, nutmeg, chocolate chips) and increased the vanilla to make up for the missing almond extract.  I then took the chocolate chips and melted them and dipped half of the twice-baked biscotti in the chips.  It was good.  THIS RECIPE DOES NOT MAKE VERY MANY COOKIES.  I doubled it and it still wasn't much.  Next time, I'd probably triple it.

I've made a *lot* of biscotti over the years, and I'd say these are just average tasting. I would have liked the dough to be a bit sweeter. I did, however, appreciate how easy the dough is to work with. It wasn't sticky at all.

I did enjoy these, they were my first attempt at biscotti. I did feel that the flavor was almost too bland for biscotti, so I added a tablespoon or two of Grand Marnier. I think that would "kick it up" a bit. Overall a very good cookie.

My 4 year old son loved helping make these cookies.  We also used it to make cranberry/pistachio, and cinnamon/walnut.  They are simple to make, and they don't crumble when you slice them.  Wonderful!!! A new family tradition.

Wonderful recipe.  Slice beautifully without crumbling.  I added the cup of choc chips in the batter and also 1/2 cup of halved candied cherries for a little extra flavor and ease.
