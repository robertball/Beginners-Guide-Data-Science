Don't be fooled by this recipe.  It is the same recipe you find on the back of a Reese's Peanut Butter Chips package.  A few words are changed and Pat calls for butter flavored shortening instead of regular flavor or margarine.  She does not include the Chocolate Chips.  The recipe is good and worth trying if you like peanut butter.

I LOVE THESE COOKIES!!! They are incredible and a nice, if slight, variation on the traditional peanut butter cookie.  I use butter instead of shortening, and I also remove the cookies just before they are actually finished baking.  By leaving them on the hot cookie sheet an extra minute, they are perfectly ooey-gooey delicious!

Ive never baked cookies that turned out sooo flat. No bulk to them at all. Will I use this recipe again? Not a chance.

This recipe is nearly exactly the same as Toll House cookies. TH's recipe calls for the very same proportions of sugar egg and fat as this recipe PLUS an additional 1/4 cup flour which would be helpful to those ending up with super-flat cookies. I think I may have stuck closer to TH's recipe anyway - used butter instead of shortening and equal amounts brown and white sugar. It needs at least 1/2 tsp. salt. I also chilled the dough for several hours before rolling into balls and baking. They turned out fine. Not mind-blowing; just "eh."

I thought these were delicious.  I didn't find them flat at all like one of the previous reviews experienced.  We made them as part of our holiday baking but fewer went in the decorative tins and more went in our stomachs.  I would definitely make them again.

These cookies taste very good but turned out very flat. Had my brain not been in a January freeze I would have realized that these cookies are just chocolate chip cookies with peanut butter chips instead. Not very peanut buttery in my opinion.

These were yummy! We added chocolate chips to half the batter. Both kinds were good.

These cookies were not great. They took much longer in the oven that stated. I was planing on bringing them into work but after tasting them I decided not to:(

This recipe was all right! I made a few swaps, I didn't use shortening, I used 1/2 cup peanut butter and 1/2 cup butter because I wanted more of a peanut butter taste and I really just don't like to bake with shortening, at all. I didn't have vanilla, so I used some almond extract and it was a pretty good sub. Great recipe, I'll make this again!

Not flat but VERY sweet. I modified a bit like Joey added 2 tsp. Peanutbutter 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup reg. shortening. I think next time I will experiment with cutting the sugar in half and swapping the 1/2 cup shortening with Jif. I give it 3 but they disappeared at the party I brought them to!

One of the fastest, easiest,  great tasting simple  peanut butter chip cookies I ever made! I will absolutely be making these  again!!!  Do keep an eye on the oven while baking, they bake fast... 
I did change one thing.   I used butter. (instead of shortening)
I'm sorry that so many others had issues with them.

this recipe is good but adding 2 heaping teaspoons of peanut butter and a tablespoon of milk gives this recipe a nice suttle taste of peanut butter thats not to over-powering
