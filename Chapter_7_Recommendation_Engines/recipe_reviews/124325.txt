I was looking for something I could make with ingredients on hand. Followed the recipe to the 't'. The only thing I left out was the walnuts, son doesn't like them and none on hand. It turned out very quick to mix, and very moist. Looks like it is low fat as well. Nice recipe to have on hand with no eggs in the house. Thank you, Dorothy!

I have been using this recipe for three years now, for the holidays along with banana nut bread and now I'm getting request to make this recipe indtead of the banana nut. That should tell it all on this recipe. Simple to make and it ships very well. Thank you!

I loved this Tea Bread!  I saw that a couple of people said it was dry so I used milk instead of water - that little bit more fat may have made the difference - I also used real butter.  I don't bake that often so when I do, I splurge.  I didn't do the glaze and I didn't miss it, though if I was going to take it somewhere I would.  I enjoyed this very much!  Thanks

I might have overcooked it but regardless it was DRY even in the middle.  :(  I would recommend the Chocolate Butermilk Bread as an addition to your collection instead of this one.The flavor of chocolate was excellent - more brownie-ish flavor.

So Good!  The only thing I changed was to use cold black tea instead of the water, it was really moist and flavorful.

this was wonderful! something i will be making again, for sure! I omitted the cocoa powder, because I didn't have any. However, all the chocolate chips sunk to the bottom. So the cake, while delicious, has a layer of chocolate at the bottom. Any ideas for a remedy?

Lovely bread. I followed recipe exactly except I made them into mini muffins for a party for handy individual size portions. It was perfect - not too dry and not too heavy. Love that the ingredients are almost always on hand so no trips to the grocery store.
