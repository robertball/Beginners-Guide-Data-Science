Great recipe!  My father-in-law loves persimmon pudding.  He gave this a good review.

Amazing. So tasty. Melted in my mouth.Easy to follow recipe.
I had a bowl of fuyu persimmons that yelled 3 cups of pulp I used in the recipe. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla to the melted butter. 
I have a child with severe food allergies(wheat,eggs,dairy and oat to name a few) I used to love to bake and now its like I'm learning all over again. Some recipes do not fair well with substitutes. This recipe was very forgiving and absolutely delicious. 
I used king Arthur's gluten free baking flour. Trader Joe's thick coconut cream for milk. Apple sauce for eggs. And earth balance whipped vegan butter spread in place of butter. I also used a little bit of the earth balance cinnamon spread because I didn't have enough vegan butter on hand. I just cut back on cinnamon in recipe. So good.  Absolutely a main stay in my recipe book from now on. And the family loved it! I'll be making this for the holidays. Can't wait to try with the other variety of persimmons.

Just made this and it turned out beautifully. I've never cooked with persimmons before. My persimmons were not ripe, so I peeled them and microwaved them with water for a few minutes. Then used an immersion blender to make puree, rather than pulp. It all came together perfectly. Can't wait to dig in.

Very yummy! I didn’t put in the white sugar, only the brown, and it was still sweet.

This was an awesome way to make use of my extra persimmons. I liked how it had the consistency of a bread pudding, not cake.

I ended up blending the persimmons, but next time I think I will blend some and mash up others, so there can be some noticeable persimmon chunks, rather than just the flavor.

This recipe was tasty but the amount of flour in this recipe is completely wrong. It didn’t look right when I looked up the recipe, the batter smelled like flour, and the recipe in the pudding was to dense and rubbery. Adjust the flour and the recipe will be great

Used Asian persimmons rom my garden, and didn't fully puree completely. Great to start with, and even better served cold the next day after being refrigerated overnight!

Second time making this. I like it better than the persimmon pudding I grew up with. It is a little less sweet and sticky and the texture is more of what I would expect from a baked pudding.

First time making it and it was so easy. I scaled it down to 6 servings based on the amount of ingredients I had. This amount filled a 9” x 13” glass baking dish, about an inch thick. I cut it into 12 servings. I think the original version must be more like 24 servings or two baking dishes. Yum!!!

My husband being in the south, this is a staple dish....me being from the north, nah! Not so much.....but I had to learn to make it. This is by far the best one, his own mothers was loved by one and all,  it this is so much lighter and better. Not as wet, if that's a terminology in cooking. Hers was more like little wet slabs, this is soufflé like, and even I will eat this. Awesome, easy to do, and so nice served with whipped cream as garnish....

This was great! I made it but added a tiny bit of nutmeg and clove. Wish I could get more persimmon pulp!

People who don't generally like persimmon pudding like this.  Or, at least this person does.  It's bread-ier than others I've tried, which makes all the difference for me.  I also think I used less than the 2 1/2 C pulp called for in the recipe.  I had a 16-ounce container I'd bought at the local Farmers Market and just used it.  I think this may have also helped with the "more bread than pudding" consistency.  Unfortunately mine didn't get the lovely cracks on top like the one in the top photo, so I don't feel it's worthy of posting a picture.  But we love it, and isn't that all anyone wants when they try something new?

Thanks for posting!  You made a family in Indiana very happy.  :-)

Yummy with vanilla ice cream. I left the pulp semi-chunky so you get nice bits of persimmon in there!

This recipe worked well! I re-sized it, as I only had 3 persimmons, which yielded just over a cup of puree. My kids (10 and 7) loved it.
