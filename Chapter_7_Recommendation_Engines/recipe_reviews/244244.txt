Delicious cookies!  I used maple syrup, so needed to bake them a little longer.  Vegans and non-vegans liked them!

Did not use coconut sugar; made only 1/2 the recipe because did not have enough pumpkin puree from fresh pumpkin.  Did not use optional items, pecans, chocolate chips.  Just absolutely delicious!

I’ve been making these for the past couple of weeks and they’re amazing! I’ve played with different types of flour and I’ve used an egg replacer to make them more vegan friendly. Overall I’m very happy with them.

He’d were super soft/chewy. I liked them but if I made them again, would leave out the bits and double the chocolate chips.
