This was perfectly seasoned and easy to make. I subbed coconut oil for veg, and agave for sugar, and next time I'll use cumin seed instead of ground; I prefer the texture and concentrated flavor it adds. Although the directions suggest the tomato puree is optional, I think it's necessary for that extra zing. A definite keeper!

Instead of using the vegetable oil, I just sprayed the pan, and I omitted the sugar.  This is a great hot, spicy meal!  I'll be making this again!

This was very good and very easy. I didn't have any cilantro on hand, so I omitted it. I am sure it would be very good. My husband liked it, and my picky children were split, one wouldn't eat the potatoes, but had everything else, the other wanted more tomatoes.

We made this tonight, and it came out really well with some minor caveats: there was too much onion (next time we will use a small to medium one), even using only 1 chile pepper it had quite a kick-- only use 2 if you like your aloo gobhi REALLY spicy, it needs extra salt because of the potatoes, which soak a lot of it up. It was really easy to make, and we will definitely try this again.

Tastes great except it was not spicy enough, so I added 1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.

Have been trying different recipes for Aloo Gobhi and have finally found THE ONE!  Added more of the spices to get a little more kick but the flavor was super yummy.  Great recipe!

This dish is good, tasty and nutricious. Very easy to make too. This is a great way to prepare cauliflower.

I liked it.  I made a few changes though.  I used jalapenos instead of chilis, omitted the sugar, added an extra tomato, used 2 cups of water, used chili powder instead of ground red peppers, used curry powder instead of garam masala, and I left the skin on my potatoes.  After cooking, it still needing a bit of something, so I added a bit more curry and chili powders.  
I will try it again for sure.

I liked it well enough, though I think I will make changes next time I make it. Maybe add some hing or something.

Good. I used two jalapenos and didn't remove the seeds and it was hot enough.

My taste buds did not like this recipe.  This is the first time I've made a recipe using fresh cilantro.  Did not like the taste or the smell of it.  Recipe was also time consuming to make.

This was delicious! Just what I was looking for. My girls couldn't get enough. I used 2 Thai chiles and it really kicked up the heat level but not too much to enjoy. Thanks SUSMITA, great recipe!
