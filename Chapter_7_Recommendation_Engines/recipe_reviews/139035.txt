These were SO good. So, so good.

I used buttermilk, used two packets of
organic caramel apple instant oatmeal (my batter seemed a little thin, so I folded in another packet), and added a little vanilla and pumpkin pie spice. These cooked up beautifully and I had no issues with pancakes that weren't done in the middle. Both the kids and I loved these and I'll for sure make these again.

For those who make these pancakes, don't
overmix! And this recipe made nine medium pancakes and between my kids and I, we ate them all!

EDITED TO ADD: These have become my kids' favorite pancakes. My son asks me almost every morning if I'm making "those really good pancakes". I can't thank the person who posted this recipe enough. Thank God Walmart has cheap instant oatmeal! 

EDITED AGAIN: I now make these with whole wheat flour, half the sugar, a teaspoon of baking powder, and buttermilk and organic ingredients if I can. Still one of our favorite pancake recipes.

This is a good "base" recipe that can be easily modified to suit individual tastes.  I used mixed berry oatmeal instead of banana.  My husband and I both enjoyed the pancakes and they had a nice texture and consistency.  They also browned very nicely.  My comments are: 1) Instead of using a combination of salt and baking soda, I used 1 tsp. of baking powder, which provides a little bit more fluffiness; 2) My other pancake recipe uses 1 Tbsp of white sugar for 8 servings so I scaled the sugar back to 1 tsp since the instant oatmeal obviously contains a lot of sugar.  I cannot even imagine how unbearably sweet these would have tasted with a full 1/2 c. of brown sugar on top of all of the sugar in the instant oatmeal.  For kids who have a sweeter palate, I would say maybe 1/8 c. of sugar would be okay, but any more than that would be a sugar overload.

I made these pancakes today and my boyfriend and I both agreed these are the best pancakes yet. I used a total of 2 cups of regular oatmeal instead of the instant packet. I tried 1 cup but felt it was still too runny. I also added a whole ripe (I mean really ripe, to the point where the banana peel is almost all black) banana. I smashed it in with the dry ingredients and then poured that into the wet ingredients. I used a spatula to mix it all up.  Delicious! Btw, I did not use syrup. The sweetness from the banana was the perfect touch.

I think this recipe is great for children, but I made some changes to make them for "grownups". 1)  I used a "weight control" banana bread oatmeal packet (less sugar, more fiber. etc). 2) I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup unbleached all purpose flour. 3) I used 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt (delicious!) 4) I substituted applesauce for the oil.  After reading the other reviews, I agreed and used 1/2 the amount of brown sugar and baking powder instead of baking soda and salt, AND I let the oatmeal sit in the milk for 10 minutes before mixing everything else.  Finally (seems I made a lot of changes...) I added some cinnamon to compliment the banana, around a tsp or so.  I used butter flavored Pam cooking spray on the skillet so I could omit buttering them after they were cooked. My boyfriend and me ate them up quick...and my dog really enjoyed the little pancake I made out of the leftover batter! I had no problems with the batter being runny...maybe some of the changes I made fixed that!

They tasted delicious! I didn't have a banana oatmeal package, so I substituted it for a Maple and Brown Sugar, it made the pancakes have an awesome flavor. Like double the brown sugar and maple from the syrup as well! I'm gonna try this same recipe with different flavors of oatmeal too! I fed them to my picky eater nephew and he loved them! My niece even ate them without syrup, and told me "These are the BEST pancakes I've ever had in the entire world!"

These were very very good! I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder to make it more fluffy. I used maple and brown sugar oatmeal because that's all we had. Don't really need syrup, but I still ate them with a little bit. Better than the 'just add water' pancake mix I usually buy! Thanks for the good recipe!

Really tasty. Used plain oatmeal packet as that is what I had onhand. We enjoyed these, thanks! Since I used plain oatmeal, I did add 1 tsp cinnamon and subbed 1/2 the sugar with brown sugar.

I never would've thought to use flavored instant oatmeal in pancakes.  Very easy and turned out great.  I also added a small very ripe mashed banana, and used a little more flour.  Will make these again.  :)

Thank you to all who love my recipe! And you are very welcome.  My son loves these and they are so easy to make.  I did add a little baking powder to the recipe as a levener. You can use so many different flavors and they are great. ENJOY AND HAPPY COOKING!!!!

Delicious pancakes.  Grandkids loved them.  I used apple-cinnamon instant oatmeal and added it to the milk, let it soak for about 15 min while I made bacon.  Also used 1/2 the sugar (I doubled the recipe and used 1/2 c) and they were still plenty sweet.  I'll make these again.

This recipe was ok. It was a good starter. I made the exact recipe and it was quite runny, made some pancakes and they were too thin for my liking. So I added about 1/2 cup "just add water" pancake mix to it. That was good, but it still seemed to be missing something. I added one ripe banana. It was then just PERFECT! I will definitely make these again using my additions.

These were just different enough to put a new spin on pancakes. My picky daughter didn't like them but that didn't surprise me. I did add a teaspoon ofbaking powder and they turned out perfect. I used whatever oatmeal I had and eased up on the brown sugar, I will add a bit more next time. Can't wait to try different kinds!

Very good pancakes!  I tweaked the recipe just a tad.  Our bananas weren't ripe enough, so basically I used all the ingredients (doubled everything for more) except for the bananas.  I also added cinnamon to the mixture.  Everyone loved the pancakes!  Yum!

Here are the changes I made: Used melted butter instead of oil, whole wheat instead of all-purpose flour and instead of banana-flavored oatmeal, I used a thawed out frozen banana (very soft and easy to smash without having to wait for the banana to become overly ripe) and quick oats.  I also cut the brown sugar down by more than half and added a little cinnamon.  Really delicious.  Nutty (from the whole wheat) and sweet (from the banana) but not too sweet (because I cut the sugar).   I'd definitely make this again.

I've been making my own version of this for years.  I butter the griddle, sprinkle nuts & then add brown sugar & pour the batter on top, then more brown sugar & nuts to the top of the batter.  It turns into a melty gooey, delicious pancake!

These were yummy!!  I didn't have banana oatmeal, I used plain instant oatmeal and mashed up a banana and threw it in the mix. I also added 2 more tablespoons of brown sugar. We ate these plain with no syrup they were sweet and had a great texture.

Easy and tasty! They were thick, and dense with a yummy brown sugary taste. I added sliced bananas on the bottom, and they tasted amazing with the recipe! This was a life-saver as I wanted pancakes but didn't have baking powder. 

Oh I didnt have banana instant oatmeal, so I just added normal instant oatmeal.

These were good, but bananas in their original form would have been better than the oatmeal.

I added 1/2 c. Quick oats and 1 mashed banana in lieu of the instant banana oatmeal as I didn't have any on hand.  I also omitted the brown sugar since my kids like to drown their pancakes in maple syrup.  I threw in 1/2 t of vanilla and baking powder as we'll but not sure how much that impacted recipe.  I let the batter rest a few minutes for the oats to absorb some of the liquid as it was a bit runny.  I may increase the flour a touch in the future as another reviewer suggested.  My kids gobbled them up.

I substituted the milk for almond milk and I used maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal. Possibly the most delicious pancakes on earth!

Tasted yummy, but the batter was a bit thin. Next time I plan on soaking the oatmeal in buttermilk prior to adding to the batter.

These were pretty tasty, though they still needed the syrup on them. I didn't have any banana oatmeal, so used a brown sugar & cinnamon one then subbed out some of the milk for a banana (maybe about 1/4c less milk). Will make again as they were tasty, but put in 2 bananas as 1 didn't give much banana flavour.

I didn't have the packet or an egg...so I used 1 1/2 mashed up bananas and 1 1/2 cup of oatmeal for the packet and 1 egg. It turned out amazing!!! I didn't even need syrup, my toddler LOVES them. I'll be making this again, but with an egg :P

For some reason, I doubled the recipe since I was thinking that 1 cup of flour wasn't enough for my family of 3. I was wrong. Made way too much. I did stray a little from the recipe, taking other cooks advice. I added 2 tsp of vinegar to 1/2&1/2, cut the amount buy 30% since some say it came out runny. I could always add more but didn't. I cut down the sugar by 25% since I though 1 cup was too much for a double recipe. I did add 1 tsp of baking powder and 1 mashed banana. I buttered the grill generously. I notice it was pretty soft to turn which some of them did tear. Served it to my family and they loved it. Glad I didn't add all that sugar since they slathered the pancakes with syrup. I enjoyed it with a light drizzle.

Used "Strawberries and Cream" oatmeal and half the sugar. Kids LOVED these and they made the house smell wonderful. I will be making these often!

my three toddlers LOVED these! I changed nothing except used spice flavored oatmeal instead. It was fabulous! they are asking for them over and over again. These are even good just to eat plain.
