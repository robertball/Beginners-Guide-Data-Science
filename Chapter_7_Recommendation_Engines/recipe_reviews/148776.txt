Since there was a frozen banana, I didn't add the ice. I did add a tbsp. of  flax seed and an egg. Chased away my hangover. Very good.

This was pretty good though it seemed the banana overwhelmed it a bit.  It didn't seem very orange given its title, I think because there's not much of the juice relative to the other fruit.  (Perhaps needs a bit of concentrate.)  I think this is more 3 servings.

This has become one of my favourite smoothies ever. It reminds me a lot of the peach smoothie you used to be able to get at Orange Julius. I used to go there everyday for that thing! It was my all-time fave. I made a half batch as I was only making it for myself. For that I used half a small banana (anything more and I think it would be too much) and 2/3 cup fresh sliced peaches. Mine was smallish and badly needed to be used up so I tossed in a bit more than half. I did not peel the peach as I don't find it to be necessary. Plus...it's a pain. Since I had no orange-flavoured yoghurt I decided to improvise and used plain yoghurt along with 1/2 tbsp oj concentrate. After tasting I found it needed no sugar made this way. Everything else stayed the same. Total heaven. It's thick, creamy, orangey, peachy and sweet! If you like oranges and peaches you'll love this! I have had this for three days in a row now. I am addicted!
