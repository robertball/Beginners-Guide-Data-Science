I have made this several times and just love it. My husband doesn't normally like soup as a meal but asks for this regularly.

This is one of my favorites. I follow the recipe but I also add a lot of my own seasonings to it to make it the way we like it. I am giving it 4 Stars because I feel it needs more seasonings.

I used turkey burger instead of ground beef. I also used frozen broth drained off a roast made earlier so lots of flavor there. No mushrooms because I didn't have any. USED multicolored peers for color. Great comfort food. Topped with shredded sharp cheaddar. DELISH!!

This was good! I cheated and made it with boil in a bag rice which saved a lot of time. I also added some hot sauce and Italian seasoning for more kick.

I modified this recipe using brown rice tomato sauce increased the broth to 4 cups and ommitted the mushrooms. I also sweated the pepper and onion a few minutes with the hamburger before adding other ingredients.

We will definitely make it again. The only thing I will do is to mix a little soup with the rice(flavoring the rice) and then add to the individual bowls of soups. The reason being that it makes so much that it is served as another meal and the rice gets mushy.

The 4 stars are for the as is recipe.  Just a little bland but a great soup.  After having one bowl I did go back and added some garlic and onion powder and some red pepper and this did elevate it.  But, oh my the second day it was amazing!  Oh , don't forget to add salt and pepper when cooking the ground beef, onions & peppers.

Super simple and delicious!! Sautée the peppers with the onions separate from the beef. Cook the beef after with garlic salt/powder and crushed red pepper. Then combine it all and let it simmer for an hour. Perfection. My husband says it s better than his mother s. #winning

Although this was a nice base for unstuffed pepper soup it was somewhat bland. When I was done making it it wasn't quite up to my standards so I added the following: 2 Tbsps Worcestershire sauce 1 tsp Hungarian paprika 4 large garlic cloves 2 bay leaves 1/2 tsp black pepper 1/2 tsp salt. Cooked for 1/2 hour. Five stars after these additions.

This was a delicious soup. I did add 2 cloves garlic ad 2Tbsp Worcestershire sauce. It is very thick so you may want to add more liquid at some point. The leftover could have used some and I might have used V8.

I used 1 lb ground meat and 1/2 lb of Italian sausage. I used vegetable juice instead of tomato soup and I added 1 1/2 teaspoon caraway seed for my magic ingredient. Also about 5 leaves of cabbage shredded. Result was great soup! Thanks for the recipe!

I had some leftover taco meat so I did about half that and half ground sirloin. I added some minced garlic with the meat a carton of veggie broth and a carton of beef broth and peeled and shredded zucchini (shh don t tell the family). I also cooked the rice directly in the soup since the cooking times were about the same (why I added extra broth). The rice isn t quite done enough but my sample taste was very good. My hubby loves stuffed peppers but the kids won t eat them. Maybe this is the compromise. I had some jalapeño I thought about adding but decided not to. Overall a good base to make to your liking.

So good! I added a couple TBS of brown sugar only bc that's what I'm used to with this soup & eliminated mushrooms. Besides that kept it as written & wow!! Great soup:)
