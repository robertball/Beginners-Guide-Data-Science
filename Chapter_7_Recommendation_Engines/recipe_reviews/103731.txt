I never post reviews but this recipe deserves attention. We live in a military town in the middle of no where so we don't have access to fresh fish. The frozen stuff is just as good. I used the Mahi-Mahi but I think other types would be great as well. I also used cilantro instead of the mint and dry ground ginger because that's all I had on hand. I served it with white rice and sauted acorn squash... Delish! This dish is awesome and I will definitely make it in the future, especially for company. Husband gave it 6 out of 5 stars.

Hubby and I loved this. However, next time, I will cook the fish a little before coating it, because the nuts were a little burned.

This is absolutely wonderful.  The fish is light and flaky, the roasted nuts crust is so tasty.  The chuntey is such a nice contrast in taste.  I would absolutely make this again and make it for company, it so easy.

We love this recipe.  The chutney is so tasty and the coating on the fish is perfect.  We have made this many times, and it takes a few tries to cook the fish properly without burning the coating or taking the coating completely off.  We found a lower temperature than called for works best for our all clad pans.

I've only make the mango ginger chutney.  It was fantastic on the cuban pork roast (also on allrecipes.com).  I switched candied ginger for fresh, but either one will work.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly as I used whatever I have in the kitchen. I used halibut and substituted macadamian nuts with almonds. The crust made the fish very tasty! I grated the ginger as I was running behind schedule, so the taste was a bit strong for my husband although he said he liked it. Overall, it's delicious and may try with chicken next time.

My husband's "favorite recipe ever" and he doesn't care for fish, onions, or nuts.  I was a little concerned about the odd combination, but we couldn't taste the onions or the coconut in the chutney.  It really made the meal.  I only cooked the fish for about 8 minutes total and it was completely done.

This recipe was marvelous!  I've had something similar at Bahama Breeze and it was nice to be able to make it myself.  All the guests loved it, even those who aren't big fans of fish.  I used swordfish instead of the mahi-mahi and cut each steak into 4 pieces.  The breading is wonderful with the toasted nuts all around the fish.  And the chutney is delicious-a great compliment to the dish. I added a little chopped fresh pineapple to it as I was using it in a salad.
