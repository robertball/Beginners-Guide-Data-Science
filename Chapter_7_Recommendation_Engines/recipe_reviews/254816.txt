Very tasty! I found this recipe in time to make supper. I didn't have a lemon lemon juice or fresh dill so I substituted 10 drops of lemon essential oil and dried dill. I'll plan ahead next time so my family and I can fully enjoy the recipe.

Easy and delicious this is a perfect meal. I didn't use the tartar sauce though. The salmon and veggies are so tasty on their own. Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious!! I followed the recipe to a T, soooo good!! I felt like it was a little undercooked after the 14 mins - so I pan-fried it for a couple more. (I may just be a wuss when it comes to my food! Haha). Hubby loved it, too! Thank you!

The temperature of 325 degrees is much too low for 12 minutes.    The salmon was still raw at that temperature after 20 minutes.  I opened my cookbook and found it to say 450 degrees.  It cooked beautifully at 450, and it is wonderfully moist from the foil pouch, oil, and lemon.  I will make it again!
