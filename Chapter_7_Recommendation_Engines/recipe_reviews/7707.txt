I have been looking for this recipe for a while.  It is wonderful!!!  Very nice presentation when sliced as the cherries are bright, and this is VERY good.  Trust me!

This recipe -modified- has been a family favorite for over 20 years.  I use 1 cup each of Brazil nuts, walnuts, and pecans or any combination thereof depending on the recipients preferences (one sister does not like Brazil nuts).  As for maraschino cherries, I use half red and half green. Being sodium conscious, I do not add the salt.  Also, I usually cut the dates and cherries in half, especially when using mini-loaf pans.

Perfect! I used whole brazil nuts, pecans, and chopped almonds. I doubled the recipe to make 2 loaves.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was a long 1 hour and 45 minutes waiting for it to bake, but after 30 minutes of cooling I served it to my family and guests and everyone loved it.  I'll definitely make this again!

I have had this recipe since the early 90's, a friends mother (could it be the same mom?) made this for Christmas & my husband & I like it so much I got the recipe from her.  I have been making it almost every Christmas since.  It isn't your "ususal" fruitcake.  Love the nuts, the dates and maraschino cherries together.  I have frozen it before for a month or so and it was even more moist than after you bake it.  If you like fruitcake a little bit, I think you will like this the best.    I am headed to my kitchen to make it after I finish this review. :-)

This is my 4th time to make this cake.  I cook it for an additional 10 minutes because it is so dense.  I lined my baking dish with greased wax paper (an old habit but it has saved me a few times just in case).  I stored it overnight in the refrigerator and used an electric knife to slice the cake the next day.  I would recommend that the brazil nuts be cut into halves so the mixture is more even.
