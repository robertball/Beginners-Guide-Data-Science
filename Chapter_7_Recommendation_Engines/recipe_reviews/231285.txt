My family loved this. It was easy and quick when using frozen green pepper and onion strips to save on chopping otherwise followed recipe without changing anything and it was wonderful and something different.

Great recipe and easy to put together. I left out the celery since I do not enjoy the taste and used pineapple crush instead of rings. Saved to my favorites!

I doubled everything but the tomatoes and the onion - my tomatoes were diced and the onion was huge!  I used powdered  beef bullion and smoked beef ring sausage,  I made the rice in the rice cooker - and Everybody liked it except for Ian, and he is only 16 months old.  I also splashed in a little cider vinegar.  It was really good!

To MargeGC who wanted a little more zing, how bout adding a couple tablespoons of rice vinegar or a little less other vinegar-any kind should do.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  Lots of fresh vegetables so it was a meal in itself.  I used smoked turkey sausage to cut down on fat along with a few shrimp.  I made it for my parents and they raved about it!  Thanks for a keeper!

Fabulous! I omitted the tomatoes, substituted 1 cup chopped zoodles instead of the green pepper, and used Pineapple Sausage and fresh pineapple. Yummy yummy yummy!

I followed the recipe as is, except that I used sweet Italian sausage.  Was a great, easy, fast meal. Definitely made the recipe box.  Thanks.

I used brussels sprouts instead of celery, added sliced carrots which I steamed for along with the brussels sprouts for 10 min before adding to dish. Also, cooked sausage in non stick skillet on medium heat with 2 tbs olive oil. Removed links, sliced and then returned to same pan, added each ingredient into skillet. Had only crushed pineapple so used 1/2 can. Simmered for 20 mins. Came out excellent!

This looked beautiful on the plate, but I was rather disappointed that it did not have more flavor.  The recipe was followed exactly; I guess I was expecting more of a tangy, sweet-sour sauce.  It seemed too bland and I would appreciate some suggestions on how to perk it up a bit.

This is a great recipe to springboard into your own taste. I used the leftover puree' from jucing pinapples, cut out the brown sugar, water, beef broth, and substituted two crushed garlic cloves for the garlic powder. The onions, peppers, celery, tomatoes, and pinapple puree seemed to be enough water for the mixture. I used Andouille Sausage to spice it up. I threw in some frozen shrimp in with the mix as well.
