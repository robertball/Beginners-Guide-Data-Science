Too sour!  Half the tamarind at least.  Also, substituted jalapenos for serrano chilies, but that was OK.  Good luck finding belachan.  Low rating from my Malaysian family due to the sour flavour.

Great recipe but like others had mentioned add tamarind juice and shrimp paste according to your liking. I personally used a little less than half the amount. Also, i omitted the lemon juice as it was already a bit sour. hope this helps!
