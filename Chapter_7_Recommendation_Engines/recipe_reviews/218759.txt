Delicious & Easy!  Even though we like caraway seeds, my husband & I agreed that we'll try it without the caraway seed next time, it added texture that wasn't necessary.

I must say its not fare that I gave this recipe a 4 but I didn't have sauerkraut and I only buy turkey sausage but even with the changes it was still yummy .  I sauteed some onions and placed the onions on top of the mustard and also placed cheese in the rollup. Still for week night quick dinners its 5 stars. For weekends, I'd stick to BBQ'd sausage.
