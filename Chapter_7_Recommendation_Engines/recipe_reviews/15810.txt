Understand that my baking skills are extremely limited. On the other hand, after having a piece of this carrot cake, nobody can tell! I did read these reviews closely, at least until the general techniques that make this good recipe even better began to become apparent. I  added 1/2 teaspoon each of nutmeg and allspice to the dry ingredients, substituted 1/2 cup of apple sauce for 1/2 cup of the oil, and added 1 cup of golden raisins to the batter. I also doubled the frosting, and had plenty to frost the cake plus a little left over. Then, since I'm baking at an altitude of 8,000-feet, I increased the flour to 2-1/4 cups, decreased the baking powder to 1-1/2 teaspoons, decreased the sugar to 1-1/2 cups, increased the baking temperature to 375F and decreased the cooking time to 40 minutes. I made 2-9" rounds (parchment/grease/floured, of course) and they came out perfectly. Guess I better start a cake section in my home recipe book, because this one will be made a few times a year! Thanks, Linda! And thanks to all those real bakers who take the time and effort to make such great suggestions for us neophytes!

This cake is absolutely delicious and the best carrot cake recipe I have ever tried.  The icing really makes it.  Tip - make sure you stir in the ingredients by hand as suggested.  Do not use an electric mixer or the cake will really sink (I learned the hard way).  This cake is also great as a bundt cake - make sure you grease the pan thoroughly.

A definite "keeper" - moist, delicious and not too sweet.  I substituted applesauce for half of the oil and added yellow raisins.  The cake, and frosting, were perfect.

I tried this recipe but substituted half the oil with low-fat buttermilk, added another cup of shredded carrots, and doubled the cream cheese frosting.  It didn't sink (mixed with wooden spoon) and the cake received rave reviews.   Hubby gets his carrot cake fix often at  boutiques and bakeries but swears this is the best.  Next time I will delete the coconut and switch the eggs with egg substitute.  Might even try non-fat cream cheese.  This is the best carrot cake I have tried.

Wonderful recipe!  I didn't have coconut so I omitted that and I wanted to cut down on the oil--so I substituted 2/3 cup applesauce and used only 1/3 cup oil.  It turned out great!  Next time I make it, I'd like to use an egg substitute for 2 of the 3 whole eggs to lower the fat even more and reduce the cholesterol.  Will definitely make this cake again!

Delicious and SO MOIST!  I made it for a birthday, so I decided to bake 2 8" layers.  It was so moist that it cracked while I was icing it.  I would definetly make it in the suggested 9x13 pan next time.  So, so tasty!

Absolutely scrumptious!! I made this for my Easter dinner, and it was a big hit--even with the kids. I did leave out the coconut, only because some do not prefer that, and I did increase the amount of carrots to 3 cups. Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was an excellent moist cake. I reduced the oil by a 1/4 cup and added a jar of carrot baby food. It was fabulous. Extremely moist. I frosted it with the whipped cream cream cheese frosting and it was perfect. My husband woke up and headed straight for the last piece for breakfast.

This is THE best carrot cake recipe I have ever made, and the only one I will use. I make it healthier by subbing applesauce for all of the oil and then I don't drain the crushed pineapple (add it juice and all). I use 2 tsp vanilla and leave out the coconut. I originally got this recipe from another site, but was glad to find it on allrecipes! I make it into two 9" round layers and double the frosting (to fill, cover, and decorate the cake). This is a MUST try!

This was a lot easier to make than I thought it would be.  I got praise from everyone that tried it.  They all said it was the best carrot cake they had ever had.  Of course now everyone keeps bugging me to make it again.  It was a hit!

This is the best carrot cake I have ever made. Every time I take this cake to a gathering, everyone requests the recipe. I did a fundraiser for the American Cancer Society "Relay for Life" and took orders foar this cake.  I made 14 cakes on one weekend and have people wanting me to make more.  I will be making 3 more tonight. I did not change a thing on this recipe and it was perfect. Thanks for a great recipe.

This cake was made with only one modification: 1/4 cup less sugar. It was notably less sweet, and very good. I baked it in two 9" rounds for about 40 mins, it was actually a light, airy and quite good. Double the frosting recipe for ample quantity to cover the cake - and add a teaspoon of vanilla to the recipe.

I give this four stars instead of five not because it didn't taste good - it was great - but because I modified the recipe. I made two 9 inch rounds, stacked them with a layer of fruit preserves in between, and frosted the whole thing with cream cheese frosting. I also tweaked the recipe to make it a little lighter - 1/4 cup oil + 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1 1/4 cup sugar instead of 1 3/4 cup, and I used fat-free cream cheese and only 1 cup of powdered sugar for the frosting. I also substituted a cup of golden raisins for the coconut because my husband doesn't like coconut. Ok, so it's still not health food - but those modifications cut quite a few calories, and no one who tried it even noticed the difference!

This was the BEST carrot cake I've ever made.  I took it to a potluck and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  I mostly followed the recipe except that I added 1 cup raisens, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, and substituted half the oil with applesauce.  I also cut down the sugar to 1.25 cups.   *if you want to make a layer cake*: the frosting isn't enough, I would double it next time.  I ran out of frosting and ended up covering the top and sides of the cake with cool whip.  Still very good!

This is fabulous.  I changed a few things but am certain it would be just as tasty as written.  (a)  1 cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown.  (b) 1/3 cup appliesauce and 2/3 cup oil.  (c) 3 cups shredded carrots.  (d) 20 oz can pineapple drained well. (e) sprinkled chopped pecans on top after frosting, rather than putting nuts in the cake -- just because I forgot to put them in, but I think this is how I will do it from now on.  (f) Baked in two round tins for a two layer cake rather than a 9 x 13.  Reduced baking time by about 10 minutes (but do the toothpick test).  This one is a keeper.

Very good carrot cake. I only added 3/4 cup of sugar knowing I would frost the cake with a sweet cream cheese frosting. I also did not drain the pineapple. the cake came out nice and moist but not too moist.

Loved this recipe! I altered it for less fat and sugar but substituting 1/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce instead of one ENTIRE cup of oil...(ick).

I also substituted Splenda by using 1/2 cup sugar and 1 cup Splenda instead of the 1 3/4 cups sugar.

Last thing I modified was to add about 1/2 cup of grated zucchini.

I baked it in a bundt pan for the same amount of time and then iced it with a cream cheese, butter, xxx sugar recipe,,,topped with dried cranberries.

Its a beautiful Holiday cake!!

Excellent, and fortunately hard to mess up, since I messed with it a bit-- nothing too grave. We didn't have coconut, AND "the boy" doesn't care for it, so I added another cup of carrots in place of the coconut. 3 cups of carrots is roughly a full pound of carrots, FYI, if you buy them in the smaller 1 1b bags. I shredded with my KA slicer attachment, but probably should have used a smaller grater than the one I did; I had pretty sizable shreds of carrot, and probably would have preferred they "melt" a bit more into the rest of the batter. BUT, my boyfriend raved about it, and I took slices to both of my parents a week and a half later (keeps well in the fridge!), and they both called me later to say it absolutely phenomenal. I threw in some more "baking" spices. Didn't measure, but a few dashes of nutmeg/allspice/ginger. I didn't really notice their flavor, so I guess I could have amped them up-- but the recipe as is didn't need them. I probably went shy on the oil and sugar a little; I always measure the full amount and then toss some of it back into the container so I can feel a little healthier. :P

Excellent Recipe!  Great for bake sales and potlucks....or anytime!  I followed the recipe for the cake but changed the frosting.  I do not like the sickening sweet typical cream cheese frosting, it over powers a good cake.  I made it this way and had a lighter version of the frosting:
1 - 8oz cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, creamed.  Add 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla.  Cream.  Add 2 Tbl. milk to make it creamy and light and up to another 1/2 cup powdered sugar to a desired consistancy and sweetness.  To finish, I added 1 tsp. orange zest for a surprise element that is very complimentary!!  YUM!

I have tried a number of carrot cake recipes over the years and while some were quite good, not one can come close to how perfectly marvelous this one was.  I have always tried recipes that included pineapple, as it simply doesn't work without it, but the magic ingredient is the coconut.  It adds incredible moisture and shouldn't scare you off if you don't like coconut desserts.  It blends in well during baking and my family couldn't believe there was any in it.  It was my son's college graduation cake, and everyone fought over the leftovers.  It was that good!  Thanks, Linda for a wonderful "keeper" in my family.

Made this for a birthday at work.  Everyone loved it and it was so easy to make.  Like others, I used less oil and added applesauce and raisins.  It is a keeper.

Stick to the ingredients and the amounts listed! If you like very moist carrot cake this is for you. I had to use olive oil and could taste a hint of its aftertaste so recommend using other vegetable oil.

Woah. This cake is AMAZING. I make it with Splenda, whole wheat flour and 1/2 oil/apple sauce and NOBODY believes me when I tell them so. Since I also have someone in the house who wholeheartedly detests cinnamon, I subbed in one teaspoon ground nutmeg, instead. 

The only other minor adjustment is that I added in vanilla and a dash of lemon juice to the icing to give it a bit more zip.

Delicious and moist.  I add between 1/4 and 1/2 cup of raisins.  I soak them in the drained pineapple  juice for about a half hour, drain them, and add them in with the carrots.

My fiancee's favorite cake is carrot cake, but I have never really liked it till I tried this recipe.  The extra tropical flavors make this delicious.  I also loved the the cream cheese frosting wasn't too sweet.  I made cupcakes with it last july 4th and adjusted the cooking time down a bit.  I am going to try making the sheet cake tomorrow for his birthday.  He says this is his favorite carrot cake ever.

Excellent recipe. I used half wheat flour and half white and added golden raisins. I also reduced sugar to 1 1/4 cups and used half oil and half applesauce. Added nutmeg and allspice as others suggested. I also added 1 tsp vanilla to the cream cheese frosting. Magnificent!

I made this cake as is except for replacing half the oil with applesauce and I used pecans instead of walnuts.  This cake is wonderful.   Very moist dense cake and the frosting makes this perfect.  Thanks for the great recipe that I will share and use often Linda!!

I followed the recipe exactly except for 2 minor changes, raisins in place of walnuts (realized at the last minute that I didn't have any) and a bit less sugar in the frosting.  I really loved the texture (and I can only think it would be even better with the walnuts) but I think it's a little too sweet and it's oily.  I made cupcakes instead of a sheet cake and the cupcake liners are totally greasy.  If I make this again, I will definitely cut down on the sugar, add the walnuts and use half the oil and add applesauce as others have suggested.

FYI, the cupcakes were done between 20-25 min at 350.

As for the frosting, I'm not understanding the comments about it being too runny.  There aren't any liquid ingredients and so I am wondering if maybe they used melted butter instead of softened butter?  The frosting was fine and it's easy to adjust the amount of sugar to suit your taste.

GREAT!  I added about 1 1/2 cups more carrots and put some raisons in it!  I also added some grated carrots to the icing so it was clear what kind of cake it was!  YUMMY this is a keeper - great for when I have friends over!

This was my first time baking this, and it was AMAZING! I am a new baker with not much experience, but I still have an instinctive insight for cooking and baking. So, when I didn't have coconut, I chose to leave that out. I was trying to get rid of the carrots in my fridge, so in one cake (I made 3!), I added probably a 1/2 cup more carrots. I think I liked that one better because it was more dense, and held together better. On the other hand, before adding the nuts, pineapple and carrots to one of the cakes, I got tricked into thinking that the batter was too thick/doughy, so I added about 1/2 cup water. This made the cake a lot more moist and spongy. Overall, this cake is literally the best carrot cake I ever made or ate in my entire life. YOU HAVE TO TRY IT! Thanks so much for sharing, Linda. I hope all your dreams come true! :)

I've baked this cake several times, and it always results in a moist and delicious cake. 
I must note that I've always omitted the cup of shredded coconut and chopped walnuts (my personal preference - I hate walnuts in my cakes and other desserts).

This is a dense, moist cake with lots of flavor.   I made this cake exactly as directed and my family loved it!  My granddaughter loved it so much that she asked me to make it for her upcoming baby shower!

**Note, I recommend not using those little baby carrots as they do not seem to have the same sweet, carrot flavor when used in this type of recipe

This cake was amazing!  I served it for Easter this year and it was all everyone could talk about.  To this day when my family gets together they mention the carrot pineapple cake.  It was moist, fluffy, and had the perfect flavor!

I added nutmeg and 1 cup of raisins; increased carrot to 3 cups; used 4 oz apple sauce and 1/2 cup veg oil; didn't drain the pineapple. This cake was wonderful; can't go wrong.

I made this cake last weekend for the first time. I followed the recipe almost exactly (only variation is I used store-bought carrot matchsticks, instead of shredding carrots myself), and instead of a 9x13 pan, I made it in two 8x8 pans.  One pan I gave to my neighbors, and one I kept for us. OH MY GOSH. This was so, so excellent! This is the only carrot cake recipe I will use in the future. My neighbors were fighting over who got the last piece!!! Thanks much for this posting!

Very good!  I wish you could taste the pineapple and coconut more.  They do give the cake a nice texture.  I left out the nuts and added some vanilla extract to the frosting.  I would recommend not draining the pineapple as the batter seemed kind of thick.  This recipe is not as good as my usual carrot cake recipe, but still worth making for a change!

This was a very tasty carrot cake. Like many others, I added 1/2 teaspoon each of nutmeg and allspice, subbed 1/2 c of applesauce for 1/2 c of oil, and added 1 cup of golden raisins. I also used pecans instead of walnuts (family preference). I baked it in two 8-in rounds and stacked them before icing. The icing was the best!  ;)

This is the BEST carrot cake in the world! If I could I'd give it 10 stars. It should get a 20/10. I have made it 5 times and I am going to make it today for Easter. Look no further for a better carrot cake recipe. I LOVE this and so does everyone else. Thanx for the great recipe! BTW: I omit the walnuts. YUMMY

LUCIOUS!!!! This is the BEST EVER!! I have made this
several times and its always so moist. I use the 9 inch pans and doubled the frosting. Added the confectioners sugar adding more until it is creamy
enough and not runny. I must say the only problem
I have with this is it disappears to FAST!!! HeHe

This cake is WONDERFUL.  It tastes exactly like the bountiful carrot cake that I had at Cracker Barrel Restaurant.  I made the cake in two 9" pans and doubled the icing recipe (add more confectioners sugar to the icing or it will be too runny).  WHOA...EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!  My family loved it.

Made the recipe exact and it is amazing! second time around I tried muffins and baked for 32 min. they were so moist that they were tricky to get out, but I only broke two out of 19 muffins.  I did it this way so I could easily share them!

Next time I want to try subbing applesauce for the oil and using light cream cheese!

This recipe is outstanding! I made 12 cupcakes and a 9x9 cake.  I substituted 4 oz. cinnamon applesauce for 1/2 the oil and omitted walnuts. I added 2 tsp. of organic coconut sugar to the frosting, slightly filling the cupcakes and added a sprinkling of coconut sugar over frosting for a perkier presentation. Winning over some of my toughest taste testers!

Finally! This is what I have been looking for. I did heed the advice of one of the other reviewers and added half a cup of oil and half a cup of buttermilk. Stirred ingredients just until moist. Baked for exactly 45 minutes. Turned out sublime. Thanks for a great recipe!

My favorite Carrot cake!  I did decrease the oil (I used coconut oil for a little more flavor) and added applesauce.  Also added 2 more cups of carrots and used fresh pineapple.  I doubled the frosting per other reviews. Perfect amount for the 2 layer cake.  It came out wonderful cooking for 20 minutes in 2 round tart pans.  Made it for Easter, decorated with chocolate dipped peeps and chocolate eggs and green coconut grass this year and it was a hit!

This is the best carrot cake recipe!   Moist and delicious! The only thing I did different, which was very minor, is I used 3/4 of the vegetable oil instead of the whole cup, otherwise I followed the recipe to the "T".  45 min. baking time was perfect! Thanks so much for sharing!

I had to omit the walnuts as I was making this cake for a friend who has nut allergies. Nevertheless, it turned out GREAT. I added about 2 oz. of extra pineapple and about 3 TBSP. of wheat germ to compensate, along with some nutmeg as other reviewers had suggested. Also, I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9 x 9" pan for about 40 minutes. I will certainly make this cake again.

Excellent cake. Moist, tasty, not too spicy, tender crumb and not greasy.  Thank you so much.  My favorite carrot cake now.  Oh, the only thing I would suggest is only bake it for about  38-40 minutes. 45 minutes was a bit too much for my oven.

Super moist, I actually cut the recipe in half and made a little over a dozen cup cakes, the frosting is delicious and it is the first time I made cream cheese frosting, I added vanilla extract to the frosting along with some rum to add more flavor. It is a delicious and easy recipe which I will be using again!

This cake is so delicious and moist.  It is the first carrot cake I have ever tried to make.  Today I am making it (by request!) for a friends birthday.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I didn't change a thing.

This cake was amazing! I made it in a bundt pan and took it to work on Easter. By the end of the night not a crumb was left. One person stated it was the best cake they've ever had and that he could eat it every day for the rest of his life. Perfectly moist and not too sweet. I will never use another carrot cake recipe.

I made this to take to an Easter dinner and everyone loved it.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, except for swapping in 1/4 c of unsweetened applesauce for 1/4 c of the oil.  I think next time, I will even do 1/2c of applesauce to 1/2 c oil.  You just don't need all that oil.  The frosting was great as well. I had enough to frost 2 8 inch layers.  I put the walnuts on the sides like the photo, so the sides could be a bit thinner on the frosting.  My husband asked me to make this again for his birthday in a few weeks.

The best carrot cake recipe on the planet! I make cupcakes instead of a cake, very moist and delicious. Everyone raves about them! I've made them 6 times now and will follow this recipe for the rest of my life. I'm making batch today. Thank you!!

My husband LOVED this cake.  Really good.  I do think it would be improved by the addition of some golden raisins, just needed that little extra, and double the frosting.   Make sure cake completely cool before frosting, because it is so moist, it will crumble.  Yum yum yum, thanks!

This was an extremely easy cake to make. I first made it for my mother's birthday, as a layer cake. My husband asked me to make one for his co-worker's birthday and I baked it in a bundt pan. I adjusted the baking time accordingly. It is a very forgiving recipe and takes well to ingredient changes (i.e. more crushed pineapple, less oil.) This is definitely a keeper.

This was delicious.  I also added 1/2 C. golden raisins and 1/2 C. black raisins soaked in apple juice for 2 hrs.  This addition worked out well and contributed to the moisture of this cake.  I would definitely make this again.

Very yummy!  The entire family enjoyed this cake.  I added about a quarter teaspoon of fresh grated nutmeg and used about 3 cups of powdered sugar in the frosting since I too found it a bit runny.  I mixed mine with a whisk and the center didn't sink in at all; the baking time was just right.  I will probably make this again but I think I would try to cut down the oil and use some applesauce since I found it a little too oily, but it was still delicious!

It's good, but it doesn't have a lot of flavor. It needs something like more cinnamon or something. I covered the cake with foil at one point because the edges seemed to be getting overcooked and the middle was like jello. I finally put the cake on the bottom rack and it did the trick to firm up the middle. The frosting needed a lot more powdered sugar. I don't like the taste of cream cheese so I added a total of 
3-1/3 cups of powdered sugar before it didn't taste like cream cheese anymore. My kids loved the frosting and liked the cake! I even put the frosting on my hot cross buns! I may make this again. Was disapointed based on all the rave reviews.

I really expected this cake to be much better based on the reviews.  My cake was not very moist...the batter was not the consistancy of a pourable cake batter more that of a brownie batter that must be spread into the pan.  The consistancy looked strange to me so I double checked the recipe to be sure there was nothing that I omitted or measured incorrectly.  Also, my cake did not sink in the middle like many of the other people commented.  I also thought the frosting was a bit runny.  Not sure if I would make this again.

This is the first time I make a dessert and the result was amazingly good. The cake is quite moist and the pineapple, surprisingly, doesn't take away the "carroty" feel of the cake. It was an instant hit.

There are a lot of comments to double the icing, but I do not recommend this! We ended up having enough icing for 4 cakes!

This the best carrot cake I have ever tasted! Even better then those I have had from the bakery. I baked this one for my mothers birthday and everybody loved it! There were no leftovers. I will definitely use this recipe whenever I'm making carrot cake in the future. Carrot cakes have always been my favourites. This is the one!

Turned out great. Did not add the coconut. Substituted 1 stick of butter and 1/2 cup of applesauce for the cup of oil. Used one cup of brown sugar and 3/4 cup of pure can organic sugar for the white sugar. One can of whole pineapple that I crushed myself. Pecans instead of walnuts and added 1 tsp of nutmeg. 

It's delicious without the frosting

WOW!!! Even by cutting the oil by half (replaced by plain yogurt) this cake is sooooooo moist. I made it with and without the icing. Great with it but without one can really taste all the flavours and it's healthier. Will do it over and over.

sigh, I was disappointed, it wasnt particularly moist and it seemed to be missing things. Raisins would probably help. i thought it rated about a six out of ten, I guess I'll have to keep looking for a carrot cake recipe I like. I wont make this one again

Fabulous carrot cake recipe. Only used 1/2 cup oil and subbed 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. This was super moist without that "oily moistness" most carrot cakes taste like. I also doubled the frosting and made a 9in layer cake. This will be made many times.

I tried a few times of carrot cake recipe, and I combined my previous recipe with this one and it turned out fantastic! The first batch i did with this recipe, i followed the directions asking you to mix all the dry then make a well in the middle and stir eggs,oil,sugar and vanilla. It turned out so thick and my spatula simply stick to the batter. I had to throw away the first batter.

So, i tried the second one. I used 4 eggs, and beat the eggs with electric mixer until slightly foamy first. Then add the sugar gradually with the mixer. And then add all the dry and oil. I did add about 1/4 cup of water to loosen the batter. I omitted the coconut, increased cinnamon to 4 tsp (i like cinnamon), and reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cup. 

And it surely will be a hit in the house! Not too sweet, not too dense, not too spongy.  Would definitely keep this recipe.

This is foolproof recipe which I use very often. I usually don't add nuts though. My family and friends are crazy about this cake, and so am I, and I'm not a "cake eater" ;)

I just made this and loved it. The only thing I did differently is used Greek cream cheese. I found it at Walmart while getting the rest of my ingredients. It was way too good!!!

I love carrot cake and this is by far the best carrot cake I have ever had.  It is absolutely fabulous.  I brought it to an Easter pot luck and I almost did not get a piece.  People were taking extra pieces and hiding them to take home!

Well, my version didn't look anything like the picture above, but it turned out delicious! I followed directions exactly as written, except as others suggested, I subbed 1/2 cup apple sauce for 1 cup veggie oil. I also premixed all wet ingredients and then added them to the dry using a mixer instead of mixing with a wooden spoon - made things move along much faster. I've made this recipe twice, and each time it turned out perfectly, so I would say stick to the directions and you can't go wrong. PS Unlike others, I did not find that the amount of frosting recommended above was too little. In fact, I had extra frosting left over and might consider adding less powdered sugar next time (1-1.5 cups i/o 2) to make the frosting a bit less sweet, as the cake is already sweet enough.

This cake is simply delish. Made this 3 times so far and everyone loves it. Real easy to make it just took me slightly longer then 1 hr and 15 minutes to be done since it took a while for it to cool down so I could spread the frosting. Highly recommend and have your cup of coffee or glass of milk to enjoy with it.

Really great recipe, I left out the nuts did not have them and the rest of the recipe I made as written.  The cake was moist, tasty and with the cream cheese icing was over the top yummy.  Everyone remarked how good it was.

Excellent! Flowed the recipe, except where I added 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup pecans... but that's just preference. This cake vanished very quickly and was "the best carrot cake" my husbands work buddies have ever had! THANK YOU! You made me look awesome :) lol

SO MUCH BETTER than store bought carrot cake!  This cake is easy to make and delicious. It isn't too dense or dry like some other recipes I have tried.  I'm a big fan of pineapple, so I ended up using an full 16oz can of pineapple (tidbits) and also didn't drain it entirely and it still turned out fine.  I figured since I used more pineapple, I could reduce the sugar from 1 3/4 to 1 1/3.  For the frosting, I added juice from a lemon and added a little more confectioner's sugar to make sure the consistency didn't change too much.  It was fabulous!

This cake is very moist and full of flavor. Followed the recipe but used 1 cup of wheat flour and 1 cup of unbleached flour. I also added 2 drops of vanilla to the frosting. I baked them in 2 cake pans. Had some difficulties getting them out even with non-stick, oiled, and floured pans. Next time, I'm going to try to substitute the sugar for applesauce and add the chopped walnuts in the cake batter.
UPDATE: I made this for my FIL's 80th birthday over the weekend. I omitted the coconut flakes and nuts since some one the family dislike them. Used oil this time instead of applesauce. I lined the bottom of 9" pans with parchment paper and oiled & floured the sides, which helped releasing the cake. Each cake pan took about 2 3/4 cups of batter. It took about 20 minutes in a gas oven. I doubled the frosting and added a tsp of vanilla. I was just enough to do the filling, cake and writing.  I sprinkled shaved white chocolate on the top and the sides.  I got rave reviews from the family and one family member who didn't like carrots, had a slice and a half! He said it was really moist.

I'm making this for the second time in three weeks-first went to our daughter's 50th birthday dinner and everyone raved.  Today, it's just the two of us, but lots of neighbors will enjoy it, too.  I add a little rum to the frosting, which requires a little more sugar, but tastes good.  Great recipe--the only one I will use for Carrot Cake memories!

delicious! I made this as a birthday cake and decorated it with reeses puffs cereal. I substituted the walnuts for cashews because we had no walnuts. Also, I realized I forgot to add the carrots 5 minutes into the baking, so I took everything out, mixed the carrots, and added another egg so it would hold together. It turned out better than fine.

Delicious!  Next time I might omit the walnuts.  I only used about 1/2 cup and could have done without them. I also added melted white chocolate and lime juice to the frosting.  Was a huge hit at my husbands birthday.

This cake is great, but a lot of work and contains WAY too much sugar, fat, and oil. (It was a hit, however). I will modify this but using light ingredients and cutting the sugar (or sugar subsitute) in half. Lighter is always better in my book, and I don't feel bad for serving it to family and friends.

Absolutely amazing carrot cake!!  I didn't use the nuts, as husband & daughter have nut allergy.  Used an additional can of crushed pineapple instead.  Added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. allspice.  Needed a large cake so I baked 2 cakes (each one in a 9x13 pan).  Then I stacked cakes on top of each other to make one very large and impressive cake.  Tripled the frosting recipe.  Tasted and looked fabulous!!  Everyone always ask for seconds on this one!

My son's favorite is carrot cake so I made this for his 13th birthday.  I am not much of a baker but my parents were coming into town and I wanted to make the cake myself instead of just buying one.  This cake was really easy.  Everyone loved it.  My dad even called me the next day to tell me how good it was.  Everyone said it was the best they had ever had!!!

I made this cake for my husband's 60th birthday today, and got rave reviews from everybody!  I did as one reviewer suggested, and added 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce, also added a packet of baking raisins.  For the frosting, I added more chopped nuts and sprinkled the top with some extra coconut I had.  I will DEFINITELY make this one again!

WOW!!!!!!!!!!! I made this for superbowl desert and it was a big WIN!!!!!. I have to admit this was the easiest cake to make and the best tasting I have made thus far. The only thing I added was rasins and out 20oz can pineappple instead of 8 oz.It was moist and delicious. The homemade cream cheese frosting was also incredible. Remember don't use a mixer, just a wooden spoon.

After searching for a dessert recipe to serve after my Thanksgiving dinner, I decided on this one dispite the few reviews that were negative. I am culinary school and dispite that fact, I am a terrible baker, everything i bake flops somehow or another. This recipie works so well!!! It is perfect the way that it is, whoever made the comment that the batter was too thick or that the outside burned obviously did something wrong. I would make this again any day, I will probably use a little less sugar in the cake and also in the icening, (I prefer a little less sweet).....all in all, GREAT RECIPE!!

This is the best tasting cake!!  I substituted neufchatel cheese in the frosting to cut calories.  The 2 c. of powdered sugar is a starting point--add more if needed or the frosting will be too tangy.

This deserves a 5 star rating in my opinion.
So flavorful and the texture is good.  I added a handful of raisons too.
Rich frosting.

I just do not understand how anyone can rate this or any recipe after making changes to it" I loved it but I changed this and that" then its not the same recipe. This is a great cake with no changes, not low fat, Not leaving out anything, not adding extra this or that.  Just good as it!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday and it turned out pretty good. I did leave out the coconut and walnuts because he doesn't care for the texture of those in the cake. I did hand mix this batter as per several other reviews, but mine still sank in the middle, which was disappointing. It tasted good though! It only took 40 minutes in a 9x13 in my oven.

What a yummy cake! Super moist and everyone loved it. Even my picky 11 year old. My 8 year old loves anything to do with cake and doesn't care what is in it. A win, win here at my household.

Change: Instead of 8oz I put the whole can of pineapple minus the liquid.

Everyone whom I make this cake for says that it is by far the best carrot cake that they've ever had.  I use only half the amount of the icing ingredients because I end up with so much excess that I throw it out. Wonderful wonderful recipe. My mom can't get enough.

I didn't make any changes other than take the cake out about 7 mins early. I baked mine in a dark coated pan. The cake was moist and icing plenty. I was a bit nervous when the cake mix was a bit different kind of gooey. But overall excellent recipe. It's a keeper.

Excellent recipe. I made in 2 9-inch cake pans. Doubled vanilla and added 1/4t nutmeg. Used half applesauce for oil and Chef John's cream cheese icing recipe. Would be great with golden raisins!

Made this to take into work. Went home that day with only a tiny piece that I had to make sure I set aside for my poor boyfriend (who had been salivating as a made it that day before).  Everyone was asking for the recipe and absolutely loved it. One coworker had even brought in a slice of her own leftover carrot cake she had made, and she threw it out and ate mine!

It's not often that a carrot cake gets an invite to events... This one does. Let's just say that after I brought this a couple of times, I wouldn't dare forget it! Even my friends that "hate carrot cake" ask for it :)

Yes!! This is what carrot cake was missing!!! Coconut and Pineapple. I must say this was fun to make and was very moist and yummy. I used almonds instead of walnuts and substituted half the cup of oil with apple sauce, and used 2 tspns of imitation vanilla extract, this was eaten up pretty quickly!! Thanks Linda.

Best Cake--so moist and flavorful.  I followed exact recipe--no changes needed.  This I know I will make again and again--pineapple/carrots/coconut/nuts---better than a bake shop's version of carrot cake.

This is a keeper. Made it in a 19" round flat pan. Cooked in 35 minutes at 350. Used a gluten free flour blend and it was still off the hook delish. Doubled the cinammon and the Frosting definitely needs to be doubled. One man at my party (who's wife says he's a carrot cake afficianado) pulled me aside and said: "this is the best carrot cake I've ever had. Ever"   He had no idea it was gluten free......

Fantastic recipe! I made it last night and everyone enjoyed! I followed it to the letter with the exception of replacing 1/2 cup of oil with 1/2 of apple sauce. I used a bundt pan and baked it for about 55 minutes. Thank you so much! I will definitely use it again!

I'm not a baker, but this recipe with the additional recommendations was, well, a piece of cake to make. I only made one mistake, accidentally added too much of the chopped walnuts. It worked out, though I think the cake would have been a bit moister with out them. I substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup in the cake mix. Since I opted to make a 9" layer cake I doubled the frosting, which was more than enough.  I only used one cup of the powdered sugar in the frosting and everyone said the frosting was perfect, sweet enough without going over the top. The cake was a big hit and I'll definitely make it again.

I made this recipe and it is fabulous! That having been said, I modified it a bit. I replaced the oil with an equal amount of applesauce, I used a full 20oz can of crushed pineapple and squeezed it in cheese cloth to get all the juice out, and finally I added 1/2 cup of golden raisins. It was a huge hit. We decided we liked it without frosting it was so good.

This is truly the best carrot cake recipe EVER. So many people want this recipe from me. Moist and delicious ! The pineapple does the trick. I use pecannuts instead of walnuts.

This was a fabulous recipe! I made it for my mom's birthday cake and she raved and wants the recipe:)I made a couple of small changes, and these changes are ones I make with all recipes, for health reasons. I cut the sugar in half (3/4c), and instead of 1c. of oil, I used 1/2 c., and added 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce. Absolutely delicious!

Delicious!  Easy and very quick to make.  I did substitute 1/4 cup of the oil for apple sauce, added a bit of nutmeg and allspice, and I used 3 jumbo eggs.  I also added a few drops of vanilla extract in the icing.  This cake tastes JUST like those found in a store/restaurant.  It came out VERY moist – just what I wanted – and my hubby loved it!  I WILL be making this again!

This is a great cake, not to moist not too dry. I didnt have walnuts so I substituted with cashew nuts,  crushed into small pieces. I let it cook for 45 minutes but it didnt cook all the way in the middle, so i guess it cooks better in a bundt pan. Next time i will leave it for a couple of more minutes. The cake def. tastes way better after leaving it in the fridge overnight!! Thanks for this recipe!!

Incredibly, incredibly moist! This is the ONLY carrot cake recipe you'll ever need. I baked this in cupcake liners and ended up with 18 good-sized cupcakes (16 by the time I've typed this up) for about 25min. My husband loved that the sweetness was just right. Yum yum yum!

My family begs for this cake!  I've made it so many times since I discovered it here. Wow what a taste delight.  It is also one of those that get's better with time.

Made this again yesterday, Ladies you can't screw it up. I made mine in a bundt pan and it did take about 15 minutes extra but when I flipped it out on the cake plate it was so beautiful. It comes out with a kind of glaze over the crust from the pineapple juice and sugar. I frosted that baby up and served it after dinner. I took a piece over to my neighbor who likes to have a little desert when I bake. The doorbell rang and he held out his plate and said " may I have seconds, please?" It's that good!

EXCELLENT recipe! The only change I did was used 1 cup sugar and 2 tsp of vanilla. But other than that, it was extremely moist and delicious!! Even my husband, who IS NOT cake eater, ate all my cupcakes!! I hadn't even put frosting on them yet! Anyway, I made two 8 inch cakes and used the leftover batter for 5 cupcakes. Will definitely be my go to carrot cake recipe.

I have looked for years for a great carrot cake.  I omit the coconut as I don't care for that.  I sometimes use the raisins and sometimes don't depending on my mood.  It is alway moist and delicious.

I've used this recipe multiple times and its always a hit. I use about a half cup less sugar in both the batter and frosting and i use fresh pineapples instead of canned.  The cake is so deliciously moist and not overwhelmingly sweet.

I was a little worried making these, but I wanted to make something that my son would like for his 1st birthday.  I made cupcakes and baked for approx 25 min.  Frosted them with cream cheese frosting II.  Everyone raved...adults, kids, and my son ate every bite!

Fabulous and so easy!! I used "matchstick" carrots from the grocery instead of grating whole ones and then half applesauce/oil like others have suggested. I didn't have the coconut, but didn't miss it. The cake was moist and so tasty!!

This cake was moist and totally delicious.I made this recipe as written. No changes needed here. It was a great addition on Easter, but I would make this one any time of the year. I did have to double the frosting though. It was YUMMY! A Keeper!

Too much oil!  If I make this again,  I'll try the applesauce as others suggested.  I had to add alot more confectioner's sugar than the recipe called for.  An ok cake.

MMMMM....Very nice cake! I used less sugar ,used coconut oil, more pineapple and added raisins. It was tender and moist. It got better everyday. I used fresh whipped cream as a topping and it was great. Thanks for such an easy, tasty recipe.

very very moist - which made it tricky to bake in round tins (but managed) I only used the icing between the 2 layers and made a quick sugar / water / lemon juice syrup to brush on the top. It is an excellent cake definitely ruined the diet for the week.

This recipe is by far the best I have ever made. I have gone so far as to copy it for my friends and it is virtually no fail if prepared as instructed. I have made this cake numerous times and each time it is perfect!!  Everyone love it.

PERFECT!!! I used applesauce for the oil. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic - very moist. Could use more cinnamon and a little bit of nutmeg, maybe.

This cake is amazing!! Any time I have made this for a function I have always got many compliments; people love it! I like to add ground clove to the cake mixture to increase the flavor and for the frosting, I use two-8 ounce packages of cream cheese instead of one and add some vanilla and a little milk to the frosting mixture. I usually make this cake in two round pans and make it into a layer cake as picture shows but recipe says use a 9x13 pan which is fine too.

The cake is exceptional--moist and delicious. But I had the same problem that someone earlier did with the frosting...it was too watery to put on the cake, even after I put it in the fridge to stiffen. I used softened butter but not melted.
  The next time I made the frosting I used only half the butter and that made a HUGE difference.

This a nice variation. I baked this cake a couple of days ago and today, there isn't a crumb left. I could not give it 5 stars because I couldn't get past the gummy texture. I baked the cake 'til a toothpick came out dry (45 min.) so it wasn't an issue of being underbaked. The thick moist, batter produced a very dense, heavy cake with LARGE crumbs- giving it a gummy texture. THIS IS NOT A DAINTY CAKE by any means. Very hearty, very sweet. Overall, very good flavor combo with the addition of pineapple and coconut. This would be great with a simple butter-sugar glaze IMHO. DH and friends devoured it!

Simply amazing!  I live at a high altitude, so I made minor flour and sugar and baking changes.  This was so easy.  And so amazing.  Made it into cupcakes.  Also added nutmeg and allspice.  Did applesauce and oil combo (50/50).  They are delicious and moist! Perfect!  Not oily at all.

For the frosting I had some pumpkin spice cream cheese.  Wow!

Thanks so much!

I made this for my mother-in-law's 80th birthday for about 20 people and made 2 cakes, doubling the recipe and EVERYONE loved it.  I followed the advice of others and decreased the oil to 1/4 C and 3/4 C applesauce and increased the cinnamon by 3/4 teaspoon more than called for in each cake plus some freshly grated nutmeg, just a a little (maybe half a tspn) and the icing was perfect.  I will definitely be keeping that recipe.  Thank you Linda for your receipe for the best cake I have ever made !!!

This cake was awesome!  I made it for my Dad who is a fan of carrot cake and now he is an even bigger fan of pineapple carrot cake. It was also a lot easier than I had anticiapted...baking a cake from scatch always seems harder, but this was simple.

This cake won me lots of compliments! I followed the previous suggestions about the extra batter and made six cupcakes, baking them for 15 minutes in the same oven. The remaining batter made a perfect cake. I omitted the coconut from my recipe due to requests. I also added about 4 oz. of cream cheese to the frosting and doubled the amount of juice. Yummy!

Changed the recipe quite a bit but still turned out great.  I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose.  Added about 1 cup rolled oats.  Used 1 cup grated zuchinni and 1 cup carrot.  Also added chocolate chips and dried cranberries in addition to the walnuts and raisins.  Omitted the pineapple and coconut (did not have on hand).  Added about 1/4 cup OJ.  Made frosting as directed.  Everyone ate their whole portion to the last bite (including 3 year old twins).

Nice and moist cake! I did make some alterations to make it a little healthier.  Instead of white flour I used whole wheat flour,  reduced the sugar to  1 cup , added 1 cup of raisins,  and used sliced almonds instead of walnuts.  My family and friends love my healthy version.

I have made many, many carrot cake recipes, but this one is my absolute favourite!! As usual, many of us add our personal flair. I used half white and half brown sugar here which produced a darker cake with a caramel undertone. I also reduced the sugar by a quarter cup. I added the zest of an orange, an extra teaspoon of mixed spice and another extra teaspoon of ground ginger. The addition of the orange was amazing!! You have to try it! For the icing, I used only two thirds of the icing sugar as reflected in the recipe, and also added a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Wow!!!!! For those who are, regretfully, not fans of coconut, you can't actually taste any coconut in this recipe. I used fine, unsweetened desiccated coconut, and it merely added to the soft, moist texture of the cake. I also used two small loaf pans to make this cake in. Two sizeable carrot cakes were produced. Worth every penny!!

Perfect as is! I made it exactly as the recipe called for and it turned out perfectly.  I used two 9 inch round pans and cut the bake time to 35 minutes. Turned out perfectly moist! I made it for Easter and there wasn't a piece left after dinner. This will be my go-to from here on out!

This was such a delicious cake! I made it for Easter and it was a hit. It's so close to my Grandma's recipe but this one has vanilla and coconut. Just those two additions kicked it into awesome! We all enjoyed this recipe as is....no tweaks required :)

Changes I made was to shred carrots myself (thinner strips of carrot), added rehydrated regular raisin (because I did not have golden ones), left out the walnuts (due to a guest having allergies), used a mango applesauce of my toddlers and then brought up to 1 cup with oil and followed mostly what WileyP wrote.  The pineapple was weighed for 8oz as I had a 20oz can.  I made this into cupcakes and baked for approximately 20-25 mins until done.  I never knew Carrot cake could taste so good.

I am hard to impress and this was wonderful! I couldn't find my tride and true recipe and had already purchased the ingredients. So I looked to trusty Allrecipe. I hate coconut, so we eliminated that. I followed MoniqueB's recommendation and used 1 stick butter and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil. I reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cup and I ALWAYS half the baking soda. It was super moist and the only thing I did differently to the frosting was I used 1/2 cup butter 4 oz. or 1/2 brick cream cheese and 1/4 cup pineapple juice

I added raisins to the recipe, which I think made this cake really "pop." My guests said it could use a little more spice; your mileage may vary. I personally loved it, and we had 1 piece left after our potluck yesterday.

I needed 2 batches of frosting to frost and decorate a 2-layer 10" round cake.

Best carrot cake I've ever eaten. Made it as written except I used raw sugar instead of white refined sugar. I also baked it in two round cake pans. Everyone at our dinner party raved. So good!

I made this and for making a cake from scratch for the FIRST time, this came out delicious!  Everyone loved it too. It stayed moist even after a few days of cooking.  I didn't have nuts on hand so I didn't use it. I messed up on the frosting and accidentally doubled the amount of sugar (oops) but even that still came out good. It was too sweet for me, but my friends thought it still tasted good.

I have made a few carrot cake recipes in my life time - this with a few weeks was about perfect. I just took them to a BBQ as a request - and they got rave reviews! 

I hand mixed the batter. I added allspice and nutmeg as others suggested, omitted coconut, I only had 1/3 cup oil on hand so I used 1/3 oil, 1/3 butter, 1/3 applesauce - and they were taaaasty! I made cupcakes out of the batter and they came out beautiful. This is now my go-to recipe for carrot cake!

This was a very good cake. I'm not a big cake person, but this was yummy. I did take someone's advice and cut the oil in half and add a half cup of applesauce. This recipe will probably become a tradition. :)

Excellent recipe, light fluffy cake.  Made cupcakes regular 12 ech, mini 22 ech.  Used very little icing as cake was great tasting with just a hint of cream cheese and much much healthier for all. Modification to cake recipe as follows:  1 1/4 cp granular sugar, 1/3 cp pineapple (freshly grated), 1/2 mixed nuts slightly chopped, 2 1/2 cp carrots (freshly grated).

Modifications to icing as follows:  1 cp powdered sugar

This is an awesome recipe. I cook it in a sheet cake pan and it turns out moist and delicious. I use coconut oil to boost the health benefits. At a party of 24, EVERYONE loved it; and a friend who never enjoys cake had a second helping.

aside from hand grating the carrots, the recipe was easy.  It did get good reviews from my family (including my one year old that cried until I gave her more) but I found it slightly dry.  Next time I may decrease the time I baked it just a little.

Made this a few days ago and we just finished devouring it last night. A few things: I used fresh pineapple instead of canned, and fresh coconut (unsweetened). I cut the sugar by half. I also subbed coconut oil for the vegetable oil because I'm trying to get away from using vegetable oil period. The batter was a bit dry and sticky (not sure if the oil sub was the cause), so I added about 1/3 cup pineapple juice, a little more coconut oil and about 1/4 cup water to get it to the right consistency. The end result was AMAZING. A super moist cake that isn't too sweet. One tip: The icing they mention in the recipe is just enough for a simple bundt (what I ended up doing because I was low on cream cheese), but if you plan to do a double-layer round, you'll need to double the icing at minimum.

Just delish! I substituted the flour for spelt flour, sugar for coconut sugar (1 1/4 cups), oil for macadamia nut oil (3/4 cup)...I had run out of walnuts so chopped up some almonds and for the icing...I mixed plain yoghurt with raw honey and a tiny bit of vanilla essence - AMAZING!! Can't believe the resemblance of yoghurt to cream cheese.

This cake was a total hit at work when I brought it for a birthday party. I would totally make this again. I did substitute pecans for the walnuts but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I've also made cupcakes out of this.

We love this recipe - improvised and made 12 little cupcakes and one 9x9 pan  because some of the children cannot have nuts.  It worked!  Also made the 9x13.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a "T" and it is wonderful.

I made this cake for a family birthday celebration. Everyone loved it - several people said it was the best carrot cake they've ever had. I stuck pretty close to the original recipe but made layers so I doubled the icing and reduced the baking time. This is a keeper!!

I have made this cake at least 5 times already. It doesn't last two days around my family. I only made a few minor changes. I traded half of the oil for applesauce. Then I added golden raisins to the recipe. It has been a complete hit with everyone. Thanks for sharing!

I've made this a couple of times.  I go a little nuts with the cream cheese frosting.  But, this cake is the most amazing I've ever had.  It has ruined me for any other!!  I just made it again...a layered square.  SERIOUSLY GOOD!!

This cake was moist and would have been flavorful; however, with the 1 3/4 cups of sugar in the cakes and 2 cups of sugar in the frosting, it is way too sweet. I had one small slice, and though I could see the potential, the sugary-sweet taste overpowered all the other flavors. The next time, I will cut the sugar in half - at least!

This was an amazing cake. But due to a food allergy I substituted the nuts with raisins. Everyone loved it so much I have to make it for Christmas now. :)

Best carrot cake recipe I have found.  Stayed true to the instructions, except for the following: replaced 1/2 c of the oil w/applesauce, used 1/2 of a 20oz can of pineapple w/own juice, didn't have a full cup of coconut--used about 2/3 c, and accidentally used 2 tsps of baking powder.  It came out fantastic!  Next time I plan to follow the same changes, but will try applesauce in place of oil, and reduce the sugar somewhat.

This is truely an awesome recipe. i made it for my son's playgroup and it was a mega hit.As i normally do,i played with the recipe a bit: i used 1 1/4 cups of sugar instead of 1 3/4,i also added 1/3 cup raisins cooked in baileys irish cream for about 2 minutes in the microwave and cooled and for that i had to add one extra tablespoon of flour. For the frosting,i added just a handful of milk chocolate chips and drizzled homemade yoghurt caramel on it.It was divine! Thanks for posting this awesome recipe!

This was great.  I made 12 cupcakes and put the rest in a 8x8 pan.  I frosted with store bought cream cheese icing.  The ENTIRE family (even picky 7 year old) loved this recipe.  Very close to what I use to make when we owned a bakery!  Thanks for sharing

This is the best carrot cake I've made. I love it and am keeping this as my favorite carrot cake recipe. I added 1 tsp. extra vanilla. Make sure it's pure vanilla. I use the Bourbon Madagascar type which is great. Enjoy!

This is a great recipe! Moist and the perfect density.  I added 1/2 tsp cardamom and topped with white-chocolate cream cheese icing.  Used two 9 x 1.5" round pans and it came out perfect.  Delicious!

I liked the cake and the overall flavor of the cake. I was not afan of the frosting on the cake. I think it's because I have had others that I have used and liked before.

I made this cake for Easter and it was delicious!  By far the best carrot cake I've had and like everyone said, moist and hard to mess up.  I read lots of reviews and used a few suggestions like cutting down on the sugar a bit and adding the golden raisins and used 1/2 c applesause in place of 1/2 c oil.   I also used a little less coconut.

Very, very good!  It was gone very quickly.  My daughter decided to take some to the neighbors and they were thrilled.  My husband was not so thrilled with the fact that the rest of the cake was gone.  It was moist, not too oily, and good.  The changes I made were minor:  using pecans instead of walnuts and adding vanilla to the frosting.  I would add golden raisins soaked in milk and vanilla next time, but I really like raisins in my carrot cake.

Delicious!! I realized Easter morning I was out of vegetable oil, so I substituted with all applesauce and a teeny bit of olive oil. The cake was stunning to look at and even better to eat. The cream cheese frosting complimented it perfectly!

I made this recipe for Easter and it was a huge hit.  Since I'd never made a carrot cake before, I followed the recipe exactly.  The only change I would make is to use a round pan or perhaps a Bundt pan, because the 9 x 13 just isn't pretty enough for this absolutely delicious cake.  I will definitely make this over and over again.

Very moist and delicious! I added an additional (8ounce) can of crushed pineapple. I would even consider adding double of this as well to taste more of the pineapple next time. It is a winner!

This cake is no fail, and a grand slam.  I omitted half of the coconut and replaced with apple juice soaked black raisins.  I also put in a bit more pineapple, and added the pineapple juice to the frosting.  And one final ingredient change - had no walnuts, so I used pecans.  I baked it in my 10 x 14 clay baking pan, cut it in half, and stacked the layers with frosting in between (I made a double batch of frosting) Everyone raved and were amazed.  So so so good.  I'm making it this weekend for a wedding shower and have already told the guests to save room :)

This recipe is awesome! I was making this for Easter and was going to be celebrating with 2 families so I decided to make cupcakes instead. They turned out great! So moist and delicious! The only thing I changed (only because I didn't have the ingredients in the house) were I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of vegetable oil and I used Sea Salt instead of regular salt. I will definitly save this recipe :)  Thanks!

Excellent!  I followed other suggestions subbing 1/2 applesauce & 1/2 oil and used 2 c. cake flour instead of AP.  Baked 6 standard cupcakes for 25 mins and the remaining in a bundt pan for approx. 45 mins.  Used the cream cheese frosting recipe provided and added just a pinch of Korintje cinnamon for added flavor.  Since it was a bundt cake I sliced it in half, frosted the middle, replaced the top and applied another layer of frosting before topping it all off with crushed walnuts.  The cake is very dense, moist and absolutely delicious.  I made this as a test run for Easter dinner and it has definitely made the cut, no pun intended!   Thank you for another great Holiday or anytime recipe!

I made this cake a couple of days ago...My husband and I LOVED it...We love the fact it is loaded with fruits and each bite has a unique flavor :) ...The only changes I made was using applesauce instead of oil and home-made carrot jam instead of carrots and half the amount of the sugar...Thank you Linda for the wonderful cake...Will surely make it again :)

I thought it was okay, but my boyfriend didn't like it. I guess it's personal preference. Were more cheesecake people then carrot cake. But if your a carrot cake lover you'll prolly like it.

Changed:  used 12 x 20" pirex, veg oil to 2 TBSP, flour to 2.5 cups, eggs to 4, shredded carrots to 4.5 cups
Added:  1 cup of organic applesauce, handful of sliced almonds

Shredded the carrots and pineapple together (no big chunks of pineapple) makes for a super-moist cake.  You may find you have to cook it 4 or 5 minutes longer.  Will do this again when my bing cherry tree fruit ripens.  No matter what you do, I don't think you can go wrong with this as your "base" recipe.

Having read the reviews, I must admit I was a bit disappointed with the cake. It was tasty and moist, but not the best and frankly, I think the frosting was what made it only so-so for me. Too much powdered sugar. Instead of a cup of oil, I used 1/3 cup babyfood carrots, applesauce, and oil and did not double the frosting and there was just enough for a round layer cake.I did not add the walnuts but instead put slivered almonds on the sides of the cake for prettiness. I will probably make it again for another Easter, but with a difference cream cheese frosting.

This recipe is delicous!! I used whole wheat flour and about half as much oil as it calls for. I also added some pineapple juice to the cream cheese frosting which added a nice tropical flavor.

This sounds great. I have a different recipe for carrot cake baking right now, and I am horrified to see I did not drain the pineapple as this one directs. Let's hope mine turns out OK (dinner party in a couple of days!)

Very, very good!  The only thing I did a little different was with the icing.  I used less of the confectioners sugar, and added some melted white chocolate.  It turned out great!

I do not usually bake, but wanted to make carrot cake for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day. I followed your recipe and was amazed easy the directions were to follow. And the best part is, the cake is delicious. Your recipe rocks! This is going to be best Valentine's Day ever.

Flavourful moist cake with a few adjustments. I replaced one cup of white flour with whole wheat and one cup of white sugar with brown. I added 3 cups of carrots instead of 2 and roasted the pecans. I only added 1/4 cup of oil then added 3/4 cup of applesauce and reduced the baking time to 30 mins. Superb!

Ok Ladies and Gentlemen...this is a GREAT recipe!  It truly rivals the carrot cake from the Cheese Cake Factory and that gets 7 out of 5 stars.  When my daugher-in-law and I made this two days ago, we talked about how half of it would probably still be around in a week and then we'd have to throw it away...well - not so!  As of this morning, just a day and half later, there is only one piece left.  It got gobbled up.

Excellent!  I made this cake for Easter and it was loved by the whole family!  The only thing I added was about a 1/2C. of golden raisins.  Also, I did 1/2 applesauce 1/2 oil.  It was very moist and full of flavor.  This will be my one & only carrot cake I bake!  Thank you sooo... much!

This cake was absolutely wonderful!! Very moist, and the frosting was fantastic, I took out the coconut ( don't care for it) and 3 cups of carrots instead of 2, 3/4 applesauce and 1/4 oil. Other than that i didn't change anything else. I made this for my boyfriend nad he loved it! I loved it too, and i've always hated carrot cakes coz i found them too dry.. But this cake is just DELISH!

I made this cake for a family members birthday.  Everyone loved it and in fact a friend asked for the recipe, made it and gave a piece to her Grandma.  She then had to make an entire cake for her and her mother.  I made a couple changes that were suggested, 1/2 Veg. oil and 1/2 applesauce, and I also used walnuts instead of pecans.  The cake is really moist and the frosting is excellent.  If you make a double layer like I did, and you love frosting, I would suggest doubling the frosting recipe.

This cake was awesome! Everybody loved it. I didn't change anything on the cake. For the frosting I doubled the cream cheese and added vanilla. I like frosting not so sweet and it was perfect.

Very moist cake. but not enough of a carrot flavor. I guess the pineapple was too overpowering. I did put 10 oz can in it though, so that might of been a difference.
The icing was the highlight of this cake actually!

There's a lot going on in this recipe.  The pineapple is very subtle; the coconut really accentuates the texture.  I think if the coconut was omitted, the cake might be less intense.  But I think that's the purpose of this recipe.  The amount of nuts in this recipe is perfect for someone who loves nuts.  I don't, however, and if I ever make this again, I will half the amount of nuts.  This is not for someone looking for a simple, good carrot cake.

This was good but I didn't really taste the pineapple at all.  I left out the coconut hoping to enhance the pineapple taste but all I could taste was the carrots.  Good carrot cake.
As for the frostig it makes a lot of it so I made only half and still too much for the cake.

Very good, even though I made it without the walnuts or frosting. I'm eager to try it with the nuts, and with less fat, and maybe some whole wheat flour to give it more texture. Thanks!

THIS RECIPE IS AWESOME!  Easy to make..and great results!  I didn't use the coconut or much walnuts..but it really turned out great!  You might want to leave it in a few minutes longer to make sure the bottom center is baked well.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe Linda!

I am sorry, but this cake was nothing I expected.
I made it exactly as written and it was just plain bad.

Although this was delicious and easy to throw together, I found it a bit on the overly sweet side. I anticipated this and had reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 c. Even with this change it was a little too sweet for me, so I didn’t bother with frosting. I also left out the coconut as I didn’t have any on hand but would make this again, including the coconut and reducing further the amount of sugar. Texture and flavour were otherwise great, and I had no issues with sinking.

I have been making this cake for years.  It is as always a hit. I cut the sugar in half, and it tastes less sweet. If you usually like the sweetness,  you can cut sugar by a third and not miss the difference.

This is the second time I have made this- it’s so good! This time I tried to save time by using a hand mixer which made the batter turn into a cookie dough consistency, but I was able to salvage by adding a little pineapple juice in addition to the pineapple, which also contains moisture to help loosen it up. Even with the blip the cake turned out moist and delicious! I don’t want carrot cake without pineapple after this gem!

This cake is awesome!  I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup.  Made them into cupcakes.  Oven was reduced to 325 for 25 minutes.  Perfect!  Husband didn't even wait for the cream frosting.  Said they were wonderful!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  This is going to be my "go to" recipe.

This carrot cake is excellent. I’ve made it twice.  For my own information, I made the following notes:
Eggs- large or X-large is ok
Carrots- peeled
Coconut- use unsweetened 
Cream cheese- softened
Bake until toothpick comes out clean.

Great recipe for non-bakers! I did add 1/2 cup of applesauce to lessen oil, left the juice on the pineapple and added an additional cup of freshly grated carrots. Moist and delicious! My family and colleagues loved it!

This recipe is absolutely the BEST. Making this cake takes a little time, but it is well worth it.  The crushed pineapple adds that extra something. This cake is my favorite, and I get requests for it from family and coworkers!

I made a few minor changes including substituting pecans for walnuts, since I didn’t have any.  I also made cupcakes instead.  This was the best carrot cake I have ever made!  So light and airy!  I even ate it without the frosting, which I never do!  Loved It!

Moist. Lots of flavor. Added extra spices as others, 1/2 tea. Allspice and nutmeg and 1 cup raisins. Also replaced half the oil for applesauce. I think the cake would be perfect as is just added for my taste. I added more sugar in the frosting as it came out a little soft. I did use 1/3 fat cream cheese so that was my fault. Used pecan since I was out of walnuts. Walnuts would have been better. I used two 9 inch pans.

This cake was made for a family get together and was a HUGE hit, everyone loved it! I was told by several people that it reminded them of their grandma's carrot cake.
The only thing I found was it was a bit on the dry side compared to the other carrot cake recipe I use. However, that one called for two cups of oil.. I didn't have cinnamon so I substituted pumpkin pie spice and it was great as well. 
For the frosting I only had one cup of icing sugar but I used that with the full amount of butter. The frosting was great, not too sweet and there was lots to cover the top of the cake. I would make the frosting the same way again.
I definitely have a new carrot pineapple cake recipe.
Will I make it again? Heck yeah!

OMG!  So easy and the best ever!  I used 2 eight inch round pans and sliced the layers to create a total of four layers.  I only baked the cakes for 30 minutes, not the full 45.  I also omitted the coconut and nuts and increased the shredded carrots to just shy of 4 cups.

Yummy. I did not change the basic cake but I did change some. First, I always bake with real butter. Cake: Added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. allspice. Substituted melted butter for oil. I added 1/4 cup brown sugar in place of 1/4 cup of the white sugar. Frosting: Also make 11/2 x the frosting and add 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla. (I did not increase the frosting when I made it but thought it would be better with more.)
Yummy!

The only change I made was, that I used fresh pineapple. This is the best cake I have ever made.  This cake never last over 3 days. So get a piece before it's all gone.

Wonderful recipe everyone liked it. I also added applesauce and omitted 1/2 the oil. I used a silicone muffin pan and the popped right out. I highly recommend using silicone, so much easier

Now I don't bake often because I always seem to have bad luck. .  Sometimes I believe my oven is the problem, so maybe that's why the middle of my cakes never get done.  But heeding the warning to "not panic" I pulled the cake out when it advised but it clearly needed much more time, which of course was only evident hours later when eating.  However I do know that the flavor was WAY too salty.  And I should've known this would be the case when the recipe called for 2 tsp baking soda AND 1 tsp salt.  The frosting was great, although I always knock off 1/2 cup of such a large amount of sugar.  Really unnecessary.

I baked the carrot cake in an irregular shaped heart for Valentine’s Day. The sides of the cake rose to 3” high. Despite cooking the cake an extra 10 to 12 minutes, the centre 2 inches was uncooked and fell.  The toothpick test is more tricky in this type of cake... make sure that you cook the cake long enough.

Easy and delicious! I subbed applesauce for oil and whipped this up for a surprise party. The guest of honor’s favorite cakes are carrot and pineapple, so this seemed perfect! Rich and moist, but not heavy, it was a resounding success, despite the fact that I had to cheat and use premade frosting (while the cake was still warm). I am so glad I saw that it really should be mixed with a wooden spoon (don’t haul out that stand mixer, except maybe for the frosting). The only problem was that my hubby and kids smelled the heavenly aroma while baking, but didn’t get to taste the cake. No problem, it was so easy that I will be making it again very soon.

only carrot cake I'll make in the future.  Did follow other reviewers advice of cutting oil by 1/2 cup and adding 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.
Frosting was just enough for a sheet cake, if I were making a layer cake would have to double frosting.  It was almost too sweet.  Will look for not-so-sweet icing.

I haven’t tasted it yet but it looks yummy! I used coconut oil and didn’t add shredded coconut. It cooked 8 mins faster in my convection oven.

Flavor was good and interior of cake was moist but I didn't care for the crispy, oily outside of the cake. That said, I would make again but probably make some changes for my personal preference.

I made this using PC brand gluten free flour for my daughter who has Celiac Disease.  I used apple sauce for half of the oil as many of the reviewers did. I didn’t use any nuts, otherwise followed the recipe and it turned out fantastic.  Very moist with great flavour.  I will definitely make again.

This was amazing. Very moist with great flavour.
Loved the pineapple in it. Hubbie loved it, definitely a keeper.
Did reduce the oil by 1/4 cup and omitted coconut. Increased carrots by 1 cup and pineapple by about 1/4 cup. Came out beautiful.

I would definitely make this recipe again. I did go with the suggestions for half applesauce and half oil instead of a full cup of oil and it worked out great. I think maybe next time I might try pureed bananas; I think that would be a good taste, too. Substituted the walnuts for raisins just because there were  little kids eating it. This recipe is really moist and yummy.

Amazing taste and texture. I doubled the recipe to make a layer cake, then I reduced the oil by half, replaced half of the withheld oil with pumpkin purée and added the canned crushed pineapple with all the juice. Cream cheese buttercream topped it off.

Loved it. Very moist and soft.  I am going to make more for friends and family. Very easy to make.

I wanted to use this recipe for a bundt cake - based on the reviews, I reduced the oil by 1/4 cup and also the sugar by 1/4 cup. I also increased the flour by 1/4 cup.

I’ve never commented on recipes before but this one is a keeper. I followed it exactly and doubled the recipe. I used 2 round pan 9 inch each and 4” deep. It took a lot longer to cook because I put too much batter in the pans (a little over half filled). I had to use a buttercream icing because the person I’m making it for doesn’t like cream cheese. It was easy to make.

Made this recipe except that I left out the walnut and coconut. It’s just wonderful. Tasty and moist. Even with no frosting. I made cup cakes instead of a cake and it still turned out amazing. Took like 20 minutes to bake.

The BEST Carrot cake I’ve ever made. I made one slight change: added grated orange rind to the frosting.  A great addition to the perfect cake.

Everyone loved this carrot cake.  I did add a lot more powdered sugar to the frosting (not a fan of cream cheese, and as this is written it was way to cheesy for my taste) but otherwise, it made a very moist, very light and wonderful cake.

Absolutely Delicious!! I made three changes. I used a 16oz can crushed pineapple drained. I also only put 1 cup of powdered sugar in the frosting rather than two. Then I added a drop (1/4 to 1/2 tsp) of water to make the frosting easier to spread. toothpick came out clean after 50 minutes. Yes, I will make it again!!

This was such a great recipe.  Very easy to follow and the cake is absolute delicious!!  I didn’t make the frosting because I need to watch my weight but kudos to whoever developed this recipe.  

Give it a try.  I’ll definitelu be making it over and over again.

This recipe was easy, quick to put together, and the most moist cake I have ever tasted.  The flavour was a perfect blend, accenting each ingredient.  A wonderfully delicious addition to my recipe box. (My husband enjoyed this carrot cake, as well.  Bonus! )

This recipe is super easy and the cake is perfection. I omitted the coconut from the cake batter and added golden raisins instead. I baked the cake in a bundt pan. The cake baked for 65 minutes in the bundt pan. Once completed cool, I drizzled a cream cheese glaze over the cake and added coconut over the glaze. Great carrot cake recipe. Thank you!

Super easy. I followed some of the advice here. I decreased the oil to half a cup, the sugar to a cup brown sugar, increased the carrots to 3 cups. I haven't so much compliments on this cake for years. everyone was talking about it. If you want to impress, bake this one.

Excellent carrot cake! I've made it without changing anything and it was delicious but due to health reasons I now reduce the sugar. I use only 3/4 cups sugar for the cake and a little less than a cup of icing sugar for the icing and it is still sweet and wonderful! I love the moistness of this cake and it's a great way to use up carrots from my garden.

This is the best carrot cake ever. I have made it 3 times exactly like the recipe, but using different baking pans each time - large square pan, Bundt pan and 2 smaller square pans to make a layer cake.  All worked perfectly. I took into consideration those who said there was not enough icing and therefore to double the quantities...... I did that for the first cake and am still using the icing for cake #3.  I put the excess in the freezer and have just defrosted it each time. The quantity in the recipe is more than sufficient!! and it is DELICIOUS!

I made this cake and made a mistake with the amount of pineapple and it still came out delicious! I added a little less than 1/2 c of raisins for texture. Everyone loved it. I'm making it again today for another party.

Loved this!  So moist and delicious :)  Substituted and used 3/4 cup white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar and also used 1/4 cup of apple sauce (All I had on hand at the time) and used 3/4 cup of oil.  You could probably even get away with adding a handful of soft yellow raisins to this recipe as well if you had them on hand....will definitely be making this one again!

Just what I wanted! I looked for a recipe that sounded like the flavor & texture I wanted...this is exquisite! I ADDED 1/2 cup of plump yellow raisins and just a large spoon extra of pineapple. I made it for Easter and then for a friend who had lost a loved one...true comfort food and fun and easy to make.

Made a layer cake of this for my husband's birthday--up there with the best carrot cakes you've ever had.  Used a frosting recipe that made a larger amount for the layer cake:  8 oz cream cheese, 1/2 C. butter, 1 # (3 1/2 C. unsifted) powdered sugar, 
1 T Vanilla.  This will be my go-to recipe for carrot cake going forward.

I made it as directed except I put it in two 9 inch pans. It didn't taste quite like I expected and getting it out of the pans was a pain. I won't be making this again.

I followed the recipe to the letter and ended up with an incredibly moist and flavorful cake.  It was a crowd-pleaser for sure.   I will be making this one again.

Pretty good and easy to make cake! I followed other reviewers suggestion to double the frosting. I shouldn't have. There was about a 1/2 thick layer of frosting. I ended up removing 3/4  of frosting because it was just way to gross.

It's a great recipe. The crushed pineapple comes in a 14 FL. OZ. can here (in Canada), so I drained that and used the whole thing. 
The second time I made it, I only used 1 c of sugar instead of 1 3/4 like the recipe calls for, and there's no noticeable change in taste. Maybe the excess pineapple was the cause of that. 
And the icing... OMG the icing! hahah

This is hands down my favourite carrot cake recipe. It's now my go-to. 
I used olive oil instead of vegetable and used 3/4 cup maple syrup & 1/2 cup cane sugar & 1/4 cup brown sugar. Could have done with just 1 cup of maple syrup I think, as it's very sweet.
We're dairy-free, so I made coconut icing topped with toasted coconut and walnuts. Delicious.

Cake turned out fluffy and moist and is pretty easy to make. Icing was a little on the sweet side. Its an interesting variation on carrot cake but doesn't quite replace the spice and flavor of traditional carrot cake. Sadly the pineapple doesnt come through at all.

I have made this cake many times.  I have tried  many different carrot cake recipes, but this is the best.  It's always a hit wherever I bring it.  It's moist and rich and the cream cheese frosting is to die for. I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe.

I replaced the oil with butter and creamed with the sugar. I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. It was very moist. I also reduced the amount of confectioners sugar.  Everyone loved it and it finished quickly. I omitted the coconut.

Great recipe!  So easy to make and delicious.  I've made it twice and both times it's been a big hit!  Only change I made was using brown sugar for about half of the sugar, I did it both times but it's probably just as good without it.

I just did a spreadsheet comparison of the 6 carrot cake recipes on this site, 2 contain buttermilk 4 DO NOT.  Why would someone choose a recipe not containing buttermilk and then write how they substituted buttermilk for some of the oil.  
I did find it odd that only two recipes contained raisins as every carrot cake/muffin I've ever had contains raisins.  Maybe it's just a west coast thing.

My family demands that I make this every year for Thanksgiving dinner.The only thing I did differently was to add golden raisins to the ingredients. This is the best ever Carrot cake I've ever eaten and made and I've made a lot over the past 40 years.

This is a great recipe,I didn't change anything major,I just used less sugar after reading the reviews and the only change I will be making next time is to decrease the amount of sugar in the frosting by half a cup,other than that it is a hit.

My son wanted carrot cake for his birthday this month so I read many recipes on All Recipes to see which one sounded best.  I'm not a huge fan of pineapple but he likes it, so I went with this one.  This was so easy to make and simply delicious.  I made no changes other than adding a little extra carrot than what the recipe called for as I wasn't sure how many carrots would be needed to make 2 cups.  It was perfectly moist and delicious and the pineapple really added to making it better.  The frosting was simple but equally delicious.  I will make this my go-to carrot cake in the future.

Not sure why I didn't read the reviews first. :(
1 cup of oil is too much. My cake had good flavor, but terribly greasy.

yummy best carrot cake ever. love the addition of pineapple and this is the only time I have ever got cream cheese icing to work the butter in it makes it firm and really good. although it hardened when I added the cream cheese so went lumpy so need to leave the cream cheese out too soften next time. Whole family liked this one. Result!

Loved that it was dairy free--perfect for my lactose-intolerant boyfriend's birthday. The only replacement I made was switching out the cream cheese for Tofutti cream cheese replacement in the icing. Tasted FANTASTIC, he loved it. :D

Amazing will make again! Good even without icing!!! Instead of a cup of oil I used almost a whole cup of applesauce and topped that off with a bit of oil to cut the fat. I also used pecans because the recipient of the cake is allergic to walnut. Delicious cake, 10/5!!! Cooked it for 30 minutes before rotating (the heater wires in the top of my oven are very lopsided) and cooking another 20 minutes. So delightful and moist and all the flavours mesh perfectly

I did make changes: substituted 1/2 cup WW Pastry flour for enriched white, reduced oil to 1/2 cup but added all of strained pineapple juice and no sugar added applesauce to equal the 1 cup of oil listed in recipe, and I used the large  hole shredder on my food processor to shred 3 cups of carrots rather than the 2 cups listed. I baked the cake in 3, 8" round cake pans for about 22 minutes. For the frosting, I basically doubled the recipe so there was plenty (I had extra) for between all the layers and covering sides. My husband said it rivaled the high-end bakery in town! Excellent  cake. It is a keeper for my family.

This is my favourite go to carrot cake recipe.  My adjustments are to use half applesauce and oil. Also add 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg, allspice, and ground cloves.  I reduce the sugar to 1 1/4 cup.  It's the perfect sweetness.  Also added 1tbls of pineapple juice to the icing instead of vanilla.  My family request this recipe often.  To make it fancy for the bunny bum cake : Make  1 1/2 the recipe. See photo.

Incredibly moist and yummy!  I made it with and without the applesauce substitute, both awesome!  I made the 2-9" rounds and made a 2 layer cake.  Again, simply amazing!  This recipe also made excellent cupcakes (27 of them) but double the frosting.  I also left out the coconut as I felt like it was a bit out of place.  Don't be afraid to try this one, you can't go wrong!

I made this Gluten Free and it was awesome! I substituted flour with cup4cup and instead of 1 cup oil I used 3/4c coconut oil+1/2c plain applesauce. I omitted the coconut shavings and nuts as we don't like them in our cake. This made 2 dozen muffins with about 3 tbsp each muffin using the large pampered chef scooper, baked at 350 degrees for 15 minutes in convection oven. These were so moist and so perfect! I LOVE LOVE LOVE cake and it is so difficult to get great GF cake. Will be making this one again for sure!

Very light and fluffy.  I  used 1/2 cup of oil and 1/2 cup milk and it came out great!  I used raisins instead of coconut and less sugar -  1-1/4 cup.  I added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg too.  Very good and baked up great with 1/2 the oil!

The first time I try a recipe I trust the person So this time too I trusted Linda and of course   Allrecipes. The cake was moist and yummy. For me I was baking it for Easter dinner so didn't want to compromise on anything. Thanks Linda it is certainly one of my favourites.
My oven took more than an hour to bake this cake. I preferred to test it as I would test any other cake with toothpick ( had none so used knife). Mine didn't sink at all and I think partly because I let it bake until done. When I put it on wire rack for cooling my heart was sinking because I was worried it may not fall apart. 
I added 1.5 cups of confectionary sugar  and we find it perfect. If you eat less sugar I think one cup of sugar should be Okay too. Try with original recipe and then next time you can make changes as per your taste buds.

This came together really easily.  I cut the oil in half and subbed applesauce for the rest.  Cut the sugar down to 1 cup and it was still plenty sweet...could probably go down to 3/4 cup. Used a tube pan .  There seemed to be a bit too much batter so I used the excess  to make 8 mini muffins that baked in 20 minutes.  Cake was done in 45.  Yummy...will definitely make again.

The 4 is only because I did not make the original recipe. I : added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg & allspice,  halved the oil and used home made apple sauce, reduced the sugar to 1.25 cups and made ample frosting. I also used ( 2)  9' round pans. These changes were offered by other reviewers and worked great. Best carrot cake in recipe box.

Yes! So delicious and easy to make. I made a few modifications to fool myself into thinking I was making it healthier. I substituted half the sugar with honey and half the flour with whole wheat flour. Additionally, I added some raisins. Came out great, although I had to cook it for about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Well worth the wait!

Delicious. In an attempt to make it "healthier", I used 1/2c. applesauce and 1/2 c. oil instead of all oil. And I reduced the white sugar by 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup raisins. For more flavor, I added 1 teaspoon nutmeg and 1 teaspoon allspice. I didn't care for the frosting though. I add 2/3 a container of store bought cream cheese frosting and once I added that to the mix, it tasted better.

I have nothing but good things to say about this recipe! I used some plain yogurt in place of a bit of the oil but other than that I followed it to a T and it was wonderful!

This recipe is so easy, delicious and super moist, I loved it!! I added 1 teaspoon of allspice and less coconut.  I also substituted 3/4 cups of white sugar for brown sugar. Thank you so much for posting!

I made this cake for my husband's  birthday. He LOVED it and so did my 16 year old son, who normally won't eat carrot cake. I followed the directions exactly. Lucky for me the cake was easy to make because it is the first I have ever made from scratch (including the frosting). Everyone who ate the cake thought I was some master baker. I won't tell if you wont! Thanks for an awesome recipe. I will make this again for Thanksgiving.

This is a outstanding cake the only changes i made was to add a cup of raisens and i added 14 oz of canned pineapple insted of 8.I would keep all the ingredients like sugar butter and oil the same and just take a smaller piece of cake if your worried about your health.

Carrot Pineapple Cake is our family birthday tradition. Misplaced our recipe but this one matched.  Left out the coconut and added 1/4 c applesauce for 1 of the 3 eggs. Added 2 additonal cups of grated carrots which I believe enhanced the already "moist" cake recipe.  Will add golden raisins next time as I recall this added to the texture and moistness. Definitely a "CROWD PLEASER"!

YUM! Left out the nuts and coconut and upped the carrot by a cup or so to compensate. To stretch the frosting I added an extra stick of butter (didn't have any extra cream cheese) and also some cinnamon too. Took it to a party and it was a hit!

Will definitely keep this recipe... Absolutely delicious and sooo easy to make,  followed some variations mentioned in earlier reviews by replacing shredded coconut with an additional cup of shredded carrots,  made a second cake again omitting the coconut and replacing with a cup of golden raisins soaked in the canned crushed pineapple syrup to plump them up,  for the second variation I cut down the sugar by 1/4 cup...  Both times I used soft brown sugar (loose) instead of regular castor... Yummmm

I made this twice and the center did not sink on attempt #2! I don't know what I did differently other than using the whisk on the mixer and probably mixing it for a short time. My husband and co-workers love it and I do too! So now a third bake is in the oven to give away as a thank you gift. This recipe makes one a winner and it does not even take a lot of time and skills! Thank you for sharing this wonderful goodness.

This cake is wonderful, My family and friends loved it. I doubled the recipe and added 1 tablespoon of vanilla flavor, and I grated my carrots squeezing the liquids from them afterwards. when I added the pineapples, I didn't drain them, I added the juice and all. I did reserve the juice from the carrots and added just enough to make the cake mix pourable, about a fourth of a cup, you can use your own judgment. I also cooked my cake on 325 degrees. I frosted my cake with a caramel cream cheese frosting.

I made this cake few times and every one turned out really well. The only change I made (as I do with every desert recipe) was to cut sugar by about 30%. It was still very sweet.  I experimented with different type of icing and they all were nice.

I loved the addition of pineapple in this recipe, so I skipped the coconut (not a fan) and turned this into a pineapple upside-down cake. Yum! As others have, I also cut back on the oil. Instead of applesauce, I purreed my carrots with a splash of milk, and it was still super moist and delicious.  Will make again.

Totally delicious as a snack cake without frosting!  Changes made were 1) reduced the oil and sugar; 2) added a cup of craisins; 3) just before baking, sprinkled some reserved coconut and all of the walnuts over the top of the batter for a decorative appearance.  So moist and flavorful that you don't need frosting, not to mention I saved a ton of calories and fat!

It's my first time to make a carrot cake and this recipe is a keeper. Made it yesterday for Easter and I took the advice of the other reviewers about substituting some parts of oil  witn apple sauce, I used  1/2 cup of oil and 2 small tubs of cinnamon Apple sauce, added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and used 2 3/4 cup of shredded carrots.  This cake is so moist, not too sweet, perfect with a cup of tea, coffee or a glass of milk. Can't stop eating it. My mother inlaw said she would like the recipe too:)

Really good. I used unsweetened coconut flakes and substituted one-half cup of oil and one-half cup of unsweetened applesauce for the full cup of oil. I also used about 2-1/2 cups carrots. For the frosting, I added 2 tablespoons of melted white chocolate to the mixture. Will be serving this again. Thank you!

Fantastic! Took this to a big family Easter dinner and everybody raved - said it's the best carrot cake they ever had. Omitted walnuts because a few family members don't eat nuts, but compromised by chopping them and putting them on top of the frosting on half the cake. Also skimped on the oil, based on other comments, and it worked fine. Moise, tasty - a great hit. I made it in a 9x13 disposable pan because I was taking it out, and it worked fine, and easier than a layer cake.

This was yum! Excellent except for the icing which was runny and only disappointment. I made cupcakes out of this recipe but the frosting ruined the presentation. I think the problem is cream cheese being used as frosting.

So moist and delicious and we all loved it.  The only change I made was adding 1 more cup of grated carrots in the batter coz I did not have flaked coconuts at that time and 1 cup of raisins.  Soo yummy.....

An extremely moist awesome cake.  Everyone who tastes it - raves about it!  I do add a bit of nutmeg and raisins to the recipe as I feel they give it a little extra something.  This is the best carrot cake recipe ever.

I didn't change a thing and it was excellent.  I had several people say it was the best carrot cake they had ever had.

Fantastic Carrot Cake!!!  Moist & Tasty!  Followed the recipe to the letter (I love raisins, so I added this to the recipe) Turned out perfect.  I'll probably double the icing recipe next time!!  Yummy!

Taste is very good but I find it a little sweet. I already reduced the sugar to 3/4 c and frosting to 1 1/2 c powdered. Reduced baking time to 40 mins. but it still got burnt around the edges. I'll definitely bake it again but with my own modifications--

this was so great, my family finished it off in a day!! i substituted 1/2 a cup of veg. oil with applesauce, and the cake was still quite moist. i also used fat free cream cheese and the frosting still tasted good. i don't know if it made a difference, but i used cake flour instead of all purpose flour. will def make this again.

I really enjoyed this cake, it was very moist and tasty.  I omitted the coconut and walnuts and added a cup of raisins as suggested in some other reviews.  I will definately make this cake again.

AWESOME!  I made it in two 9 inch round pans and doubled the frosting...it came out perfect, but did decrese cooking time by about 7-10 minutes. Also, added 1 cup raisins...the pineapple and coconut made it the Carrot Cake Recipe I have always been looking for!  Thanks...will be making it often!
