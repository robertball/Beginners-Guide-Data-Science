Very yummy and easy. I thought 1 TB of garlic powder would be too much so I cut it down to 1 tsp. I used canned beef consomme and 2 tsp of beef Better Than Bouillon. It came out just a little too salty. The dumplings are awesome, tender, cream-colored, and just right. I used sliced bottom round. Next time I will sub out the soup for a box of Rachel Ray beef broth, which is excellent stuff. I think it will help cut down the salt. I made it in my cast iron skillet and simmered it for about 2 hours.

I could tell based on the ingredients that it would need more flavour. I added in 1 tsp thyme, 1/2 tsp sage and 1/2 tsp basil. It also seemed it would be extremely salty so instead of both beef broth AND beef bouillon cubes, I used 14oz water, and only 2 beef bouillon cubes. I also chose to toss the meat in the seasonings, w/ 2 Tbsp flour and did a quick sear and transferred the mixture to my crock pot. I deglazed the pan w/ 1/2 cup merlot and added that to the crock pot also. While this is a "great depression" recipe a bit of modifying can make it amazing. I think next time I'll add rosemary and port mushrooms

The dumplings were heavy and the meat was tough.  I'm not sure how to make fluffy dumplings, but these definitely didn't turn out well.

Extra seasoning needed in the steak such as basil and sage.  Add the same dry seasoning used in the steak to the dumplings.  Boil the dumplings in equal parts broth and water.  Family enjoyed with steamed cabbage.

This recipe leaves a lot to be desired.  Needs more seasoning and something to thicken the broth.  The dumpling recipe has got to be a misprint.  For 1 cup of flour it should use 1-2 tsp of baking powder.  1/4 tsp for 2 cups??  It made one God awful dumpling.  I suggest getting a box of Bisquick and making the dumplings.
