Hint - Pecan meal is just finely ground pecans.  Or you can take chopped pecans, put into a zippy bag and crush them with a rolling pin.  You just don't want big pieces.  
When I created this recipe, the idea was to find a flavorful, but light crust for the delicate fish.

Just made this tonight - Wonderful!  I did make a mess of the coating.  After putting the first fillet through the pecan meal, the remaining meal turned into a goopy sludge and it was difficult to coat the other fillets.  It still tasted fantastic - just not very uniform or as appealing in appearance as it might have been.  I think next time I might try dipping the fillets in the egg mixture and then spooning the coating over each fillet.  Also wondering if it would be good with a coating of 2/3 pecan meal to 1/3 panko crumbs?  Pecans sure ain't cheap.

I made this tonight and it was wonderful! I did find a pecan panko breading mix at Whole Foods so I didn't have to add much seasoning but the fish cooked perfectly. Served with some risotto and fresh advocado/tomatoes. Super quick and easy summer week night dish.

I made my own pecan meal for this recipe by putting whole pecans in my chopper and pulsing until they were turned to crumbs.  However, I don't think that worked very well because the pecans started to become moist and mushy (on their way to becoming nut butter).  Next time, I will add flour to the mix and I think that will help prevent this problem and help the breading to not clump on the fish.  This recipe had nice flavor and walleye is a meaty fish, so my husband didn't have as much a problem with it as he sometimes does with other kinds of fish.

Delicious! One of my new favorites. We call it Pickerel up in Canada. I would make my own pecan meal next time as the store bought one is a bit too fine and I think this would be nice with a little more texture. Serves with saut√©ed green beans and grape tomatoes and fingerling potatoes.

I made a few changes, and wow, that was fantastic! I caught fresh walleye yesterday and decided to give this a try. I followed all the ingredients and steps, except that I used walnuts (I crushed them with a mortar) and then put almost the same amount in blanched almond flour (so about 60/40 of each).  Like some people said, if you use your fingers to take the fish dipped in egg to the flour, your fingers will get mushy and then the stuff doesn't stick to the fish as well, so perhaps use a fork to move the fish in the flour plate. I did also put much more oil in my pan so that it was about 1/4 inch high. The nutty flavor was fantastic and almost had a chicken nugget type feel. If I had kids that were difficult with fish I think they would be ALL OVER this stuff. Try it my way, you won't regret it!

Ugh. I ground the pecans and they became a clumpy sticky mess that didn't stick to the fish. One of the reviewers suggested adding flour, which I can't have so I will try adding almond flour to see if that helps.

Coating was awful. I will stick with original chicken shake and bake, which is what I use on Perch.

Yummy! We used Swai fish, but can't wait to try it with fresh-caught walleye. Very quick and easy. The whole family enjoyed it (even picky young kids)!

Quite good. I put the coating on too thick and had the heat set at medium. Next time I will turn down the heat and use less coating.

I ground my pecans and cut back a bit on the seasonings to savor the toasted pecan meal. A+ This is simply delicious!

Found some walleye on sale ($10/lb, so maybe I'll try another fish next time). It was outstanding.  I tend to use fresh herbs, and didn't have garlic or onion powder, so I put my fresh garlic and onion in my chopper and added my egg.  I used hot ground paprika and cayenne pepper to my own whole ground pecan meal.  Could not be easier.  This is a keeper.

Very good recipe for fish. I used tilapia and it was delicious and very quick to make.
