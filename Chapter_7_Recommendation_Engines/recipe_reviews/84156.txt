Great marinade! It's so simple and tastes so good! I used this for about a pound of sirloin that I cut into kabobs. I opted for fresh garlic, low sodium soy sauce and cut way back on the oil using a little over 1/4 cup of olive oil. I poked the meat with a fork and put it into a ziploc bag and let it marinate overnight. I grilled it with red and green peppers, onions, and chery tomatoes. Great topped with sesame seeds and served with rice.

This is a very tasty steak marinade. I did use fresh garlic and ginger, since I had some that needed to be used. The finished steak was tender and juicy. Don't skip the 10 minute rest (you may want to cover with foil to keep warm). And remember to cut flank steak thinly and against the grain. I will make this again!

I used round tip beef and baked it in the oven because it's february and I'm not going outside lol. It smelled incredible while baking. I baked it for 45 minutes which I think was a bit too much so I'd suggest 30. Great marinade and definitely a make again. I won't put a star rating because I definitely tweaked what I did, but as far as the marinade goes that's a 4 star.

So good.  Marinated about 30 hours just because plans shanged and we didn't cook the steak when we had planned.   I did have to make one change because I didn't have green onion on hand.  Instead I added minced sweet onion.  We will surely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Oh god this is soooo good.  Went to Costco and needed to make food for a crowd and they had a great deal on flank steak and I remembered I had this recipe in my recipe box.  It turned out soooo well and fed a crowd. Served it with white rice, but this would be great on a salad also.

Wow! I read the ingredients wrong and I over cooked the meat and it was still one of the best steaks I've ever had! My husband loved it and even my 19 month old loved it! This will become a once a week dinner for us! We tried it on chicken too and still yummy!

My super-picky 5-year-old son declared this the BEST MEAT he'd ever eaten.  Success!  It was great.

I wasn't too crazy about this recipe.  I didn't like the soy sauce/vinegar combo.  It wasn't the best i ever had and it wasn't the worst.

I love this recipe!  Be sure to use fresh garlic and ginger and marinating it the night before is even better.  I skip cooking the marinade sauce--tried it the first time and found it too oily.   We grill squash and portabelo mushrooms with this and serve with brown rice.  Also makes for delicious leftovers.

I have been making a recipe very similar to this for years. Only, we use more soy sauce (1/2 cup), only 1/2 of Italian dressing (in lieu of oil and vinegar), and 1/2 worcestershire sauce.  Also, we tenderize the flank steak on both sides with a fork before adding it to the marinade.  So delicious!!

very good but a little to oily, I would cut back on amount of oil.  I replaced honey with molasess.  It worked out well.

Great recipe, only I used fresh ginger and fresh garlic instead of powder. I have made it twice, first time with flank steak, and the second time I used it for my baked chicken. Both were really scrumptious. This recipe is definitely going to stay in my family for years to come.

Just added a tbsp. of kosher salt to the recipe, came out great. Let it rest for 15 minutes and you'll have some nice drippings from the meat.

Great marinade!  I used red wine vinegar as I did not what white vinegar in the house.  And I only used 2 tablespoons of honey (personal preference).  I marinaded for five hours (time limit), but I know this would have tasted even more amazing if I marinaded longer.  Thanks for sharing!

The only change I made was I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  The flavor of this marinade is delicious.  However, there is a major flaw in the instructions as written.  You need to take the steak out of the fridge and let it become room temperature before you put it on the grill or your meat will be cold in the middle after cooking for only 5 minutes on each side.  I will say this was a little rarer than I like my steak but the flavor was wonderful and I ate it anyway.
