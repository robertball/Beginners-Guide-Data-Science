This is a nice light meal. I added a little more garlic to the marinade. And added garlic and onion to the saut√©ed vegetables, as well as a little more herbs. I cut the veggies smaller and used more chicken stock instead of wine because my kids were eating it. I used the veggies I had on hand, (broccoli cauliflower, red pepper, carrots, peas). I will make this again when I can get more of the veggies called for! I love zucchini and yellow squash and it would be so good in this. :)

i made this as directed and must admit it was very bland. I expected a little more taste. I may make it again but add some italian dressing to give it more of a tang. I thought the lemon juice would be enough but it just needs something else.

ok so I messed up on my last rating and can't find it for some reason. I mentioned putting seasoning in the flour. Ooopps! wrong recipe. This recipe was delicious. I made a few changes though. I sauteed my zucchini, squash and carrots first with McCormick vegetable blend. And my broccoli came out a little overcooked. Next time I will add them two to three minutes later. Yes the recipe is missing something but it is still worth a five star. Oh and if your not a rosemary fan I would cut the serving in half.

Love this recipe! Only change I made was add a little heavy whipping cream to make the sauce a little creamier.

If you leave off a veg or two  don't worry-tastes fine.  I had dry sherry instead of wh. Wine, worked great.  Also I doubled the veg for a vegan husband of mine, also doubled broth.  YUMMY.
Get your serving before the fam eats it up!!

I made this but substituted the milk for heavy cream and added a little extra garlic to the sauce. Family loved it. We'll keep this recipe and maybe alter the veggies next time.

I love this.  With or without chicken....wonderful and full of fresh veggies.  Last time I made this didn't use any lemon juice, tomatoes, garlic or onion (diet restriction) and was still good.  For the sauce, infused the oil with fresh  oregano and thyme, and used chicken broth instead of wine.  Sauce is flavorful and light.  Tossed sauce and veggies with linguine.
