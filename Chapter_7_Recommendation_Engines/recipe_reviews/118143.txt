I was looking for something quick and easy that my very picky kids would eat and found this.  We loved it, although I did make a few adjustments, I added the following: 12.5 oz can of chunk chicken breast, 1/8 tsp of salt, 1/8 tsp of Nature's Seasons Seasoning, 2 cups cooked elbow macaroni, and we sprinkled cheese on top of our individual bowls in addition to what was mixed in.  This will definitely become a regular at our house.  This is great when you want something filling but don't have a lot of time.  Thanks for a great recipe.

The combination of flavors just didn't seem to compliment one another. It was a no go for our family.
