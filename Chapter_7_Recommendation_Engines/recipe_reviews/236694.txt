Easy light and great flavor.  The only change I made was using a 1/2 cup of melted butter instead of one cup.  There were no leftovers.

These were THE best waffles I've had.  Followed the recipe exactly and everyone loved them.  Froze the leftovers and reheated in the toaster oven and they were still very good.  Excellent recipe!

I like these waffles and so did my husband. They were nice and moist in the center and had a nice crisp outer layer.

great recipe! family loves it even the non waffle eaters gobbled them up faster than my waffle iron could produce them. they are very filling and keeps the smile on their faces.. I looked up a raspberry sauce made from scratch to drizzle on the top as well mixed with the blueberries, strawberries, banana, and blackberries of their choice. with a dash of whip cream :) enjoy!! and thanks again for this wonderful  recipe!

I was skeptical when I saw that there was no sugar in the recipe but I have seen the light! A waffle like this is no place for sugar. It's the perfect taste and texture to compliment whatever toppings you put on it. I've got a new Sunday morning waffle recipe :)

I also decreased the butter and salt in half. I also changed the flour to whole wheat 1 1/4, 1/2 unbleached flour and 1/4 oat bran. I mixed it like the instructions and then decided to add 1/4 c of ground flaxseed, which caused me to add a bit more buttermilk. 
These waffles where the absolute best.

These. Are. Awesome. Even my husband, who is not a waffle eater, has seen the light. He said they are the best waffles he has ever eaten, and everyone else agrees. 

I made them exactly as directed, adjusting to only 1/2 teaspoon of salt because I also used salted butter. If using unsalted butter, I would use the full teaspoon. Golden and crisp on the outside, fluffy and tender inside. This recipe made 6 large round Belgian style waffles. 

Tip: Melt butter and warm syrup to drizzle over your hot waffle as soon as it comes out. Nobody wanted to wait to dress their waffle before digging in. ;-) 

I have had a very expensive waffle maker in my cabinet for years, but waffles always seemed labor intensive because of separating out egg whites, folding in later. No more. We will make these again and again. I am hooked, and so is my family.

Absolutely delicious! Excellent texture and taste. For anyone wondering, no sugar is necessary. I did cut the butter amount in half, because a full cup seems excessive. My kids and I are devouring the as I type this out with maple syrup covered fingers. My new go-to waffle recipe. Thank you for sharing!

Couldn't wait for room temp eggs but that didn't matter.  Neither did cutting butter down to 1/2 stick.  This was approved by a fickle crew of four for "brinner".  Had two leftover which will be early bird gets the waffle in the morning.  Thanks so much for sharing.

Crowd pleaser! We usually do Bisquick waffles but I had buttermilk in the fridge so have these a try. Much lighter an the waffle mixes we usually use and didn't need nearly as much syrup!

These were the best waffles I have ever tasted, at home or in a restaurant, and my family agreed.  The recipe is quick and easy to put together, and the waffles came out fluffy and flavorful.  I will definitely make these again, very soon.

Easiest waffle recipe. I halved entire recipe & it still made 3 huge Belgian style waffles. This is the only buttermilk recipe  you'll ever need.

Very good and easy to make!  I swapped out some regular flour with whole wheat and I don't think anyone would know the difference.   One review suggested using less butter, and I think that would work, but I thought these were very good as written.  The recipe made about 18 waffles in our iron so have the cooling racks ready so they don't get soggy.  :D

SOOOO good! Been looking for a recipe that is easy, no egg separating that makes a perfect waffle crispy on the outside while fluffy and moist on the inside. This IS it!!! Plus....it stays crispy on the outside when lathered with tons of butter and syrup as I like, my dream waffle! Everyone loved it! I followed the directions exactly...with an extra focus on the whipping of the eggs, which I think is SUCH an important part.....as well as all the butter in the recipe. Those two things are the game changers, won’t be looking for another recipe anytime soon.

Not a good recipe. Waffles are VERY flat.  Not sure if it's because of too much butter or what. Followed the recipe exactly without changes. Will not use this one again.

Excellent! I followed others' recommendations and used only 1/2 a cup of melted butter. For our waffle maker, it takes about 3/4 of a cup of batter. We flip the waffle maker with 1 minute remaining and the texture is perfection between crispy and chewy. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Excellent! Followed the directions exactly. They were slightly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside with a wonderful flavor. The batter seemed thick, but I did not thin it out and the waffles came out perfectly.

Excellent recipe! Followed exactly with the exception of substituting whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour. The waffles turned out tender but crispy on the outside. Don't scrimp  on the melted butter because I think that's what make this recipe so good and you won't miss the sugar.

These waffles are light and fluffy not heavy. I started using only 1/2 the butter and can’t tell the difference. I wouldn’t use less. These are similar to our family buttermilk pancakes, so these are a definitely a hit.

This is by far the best waffle recipe ever created. Simple and not sweet but rich and fantastic. Soaks up syrup like a sponge! I never have leftover.

Stats and review are for my personal reference only. No reflection on the recipe. 
I found it very eggy tasting, maybe only use 3 next time.
So much butter! Maybe a little less than 1 cup?
Did not make 8 waffles, double it if you want leftovers to freeze.

Amazing!! I got 8 perfect waffles with no scrappy edges, and no left over batter!  I made no changes to the recipe.  They were tender and fluffy instead of tough an rubbery like other ones I have tried.

I too only used a  1/2 cup of butter like others suggested.   I usually add vanilla extract however wanted to see if there was a difference in taste.  I will add vanilla next time.   I also separated the egg whites and mixed them until peeks formed. I saved three-quarters then folded them in at the end.  It makes the waffles fluffy.

I made these this morning for Easter breakfast. Everyone liked them! I did use applesauce instead of butter, but am not sure it was a good idea, they stuck a lot. I will definitely make them again.

This is my family go to for waffles!  The only thing I changed was to use 1/2 butter and 1/2 coconut oil.  If you enjoy a mild coconut flavor it’s a WIN WIN!

I started this recipe without realizing that I did not have enough butter on hand. I substituted the 1 cup of butter for 3/4  cups of olive oil. The batter was still amazing! I made about 8 waffles and froze them for later. The one thing I will change next time I make these will be to use 1/2 the salt; the saltiness was very noticeable. I will also try coconut oil instead of olive to change things up a bit.

I have tried MANY MANY waffles.  This recipe is by far the best I have ever made.  I didn't change a thing but I did add a tsp of McCormick's real maple flavoring not the artifcial one and some vanilla..  My 4 kids devoured them so didn't my husband who is the MOST picky eater.  Oh make sure you use real buttermilk it does make a difference.  I have made it with the milk vinegar concoction and it isn't the same.  If you are in New England area Kate's Creamery made in Maine is the best.  (Katesbutter.com)

Used only 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 tsp of salt . Upped the baking powder to 1 1/2 tsp because some on here said they were flat. I also added 1 TBSP of sugar. They don't get quite as crispy as I'd like but the  flavour is great.

First recipe I made in my new Krups Belgian waffle maker.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tablespoon of sugar.  The waffles came out crisp, evenly browned and delicious.  Will definitely make this again.

Loved that this didn't have sugar in! I also substituted half the flour for white whole wheat and reduced the butter by a third. For the buttermilk I used milk with a vinegar. Yum!

These waffles had a nice texture and were easy to make. My only change was cutting the butter in half as others did. The only thing I didnt care for was the slightly eggy taste of the center, even if cooked a bit longer. These could benefit from a little sugar or vanilla. Though if maple syrup set on them, for a bit, and soaked in, then they were fine.

My family loved them.  I use my waffle maker quite a bit and I noticed these came out a little too soft, but still very good. I've never used buttermilk in my waffle maker, so maybe it was just that.  Either way I'd make it again.  Enjoy!

I didn't change a thing and every time I make these delicious waffles my family & friends rave about them.... As a side note if you want them a little crispier you can try the toaster, oven or frying them after they're cooked :)

Sometimes I think "a waffle is a waffle" - I can't say I have an all-time fav recipe, but when you're cooking for one, and hate the odd "use 1 1/4 eggs" a recipe like this turns cooking up 1-2 waffles a breeze!!! No excess ingredients wasted, a perfectly delightful waffle...breakfast doesn't get much better!

I was skeptical because I thought a waffle would need sugar in the recipe but it was fine without it.  These waffles were light and had a great flavor, probably from all the butter!  Thanks for a great recipe my family loved.

I followed the recipe almost exactly. Only 2 exceptions....I used half white spelt flour and only half of the salt (thankfully) To me they needed some sweetener and they seemed a bit rubbery and eggy. I will probably not make these again. I will stick with the Whole Grain Waffles also on this site.
