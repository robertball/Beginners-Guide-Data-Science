Delicious!  I substituted the beef broth for some Heinz  Homestyle Savory Mushroom gravy and water which made a thick and very savory sauce!

This meal was both easy to prepare and delicious!   I followed the directions exactly except for the fact that I did not have fresh or dried rosemary.  It was a hit in my house served over rice.

I made this last night and it was delicious!!!  The flank steak needed about 9 minutes on each side for a medium. I seasoned the steak with a little Paula Deen House Seasoning before searing and let it rest before cutting it.

Pretty good. I usually don't make steak, but gave it a shot tonight. I only used one packet of beef broth and used soy sauce. I'll try two packets next time.

I am only reviewing the sauce. That was fantastic only made 2 minor changes i put a little red wine after the shallots and garlic and at the very end i add a little bit of corn starch very little just to make it ticker it was great i served it on top of garlic mashed potatoes and some thinly sliced rib eye. For the rib eye i seared it in a skillet and then finished at the oven because it was a thick cut

This was very good...husband loved it.  A few comments:  I am not familiar with flank steak.  The recipe said 1 flank steak.  The one at the meat market was 2 lbs.  Not sure if this is typical but thought maybe it could have used more sauce.  Also, shallots are expensive and next time I will try regular onion.   The beef broth was very tasty, but also not cheap.  I may try to replicate it with bouillion and soy sauce with a bit of worcesteshirer.  Will make again.

The sauce for this was fantastic, however I would prefer the steak on the grill, but by doing that you wouldn't get the fabulous juices to make the sauce.

Very bland and the meat was raw.  All you taste are the shallots and the rosemary but here's what you can do to make this a 4-star recipe:
- Look for a flank steak that is no more than 1 lb.  Unfortunately this recipe doesn't specify the weight and if you just buy any flank like I did (1-1/2 lbs) you'll need to increase all of the amount of all ingredients accordingly.
- In addition to the garlic called for, add 1 tsp garlic powder when you add the rosemary
- Add teaspoon of salt at the time you add the rosemary

The instructions above call for too short a cooking time for medium rare, even for a 1 lb flank steak.  Mine was completely raw except for the very outside.  Flank steak isn't really meant to be cooked beyond medium rare or medium but prior to cooking it, you'll want to let the steak sit out and bring it down to almost room temperature and then cook it for 8 minutes on EACH side, not 10 minute total. 

Also, I tried finding the packets Swanson Flavor Boost Concentrated Beef broth packets in the 3 largest supermarket chains in New England and they weren't sold in any of them.  So I eliminated the water and simply used 1/2-cup of regular beef broth.

The sauce was incredibly tasty. Quite honestly, I followed a separate recipe for the steak, so I can't speak to that. But the sauce was 100% perfect!

Made this last night - Excellent.  Followed the recipe minus rosemary as I don't like that at all.  This was great.  Flank steak can be tough - but I did tendorize it before frying  It is a keeper.

This recipe was simple enough, and it was flavorful.  I had no flank steak, so I used the chuck steak I had on hand.  As another reviewer stated, I also sprinkled the steak with Paula Deen's house blend.  Followed all the other directions to the letter, and it was delicious.  DH and I had this for our Valentine's Day dinner, and it was as good as anything you could get at a restaurant.  The meat was tender, and the mushrooms w/ the garlic and rosemary were wonderful.  Smelled fantastic while it was cooking.  I will definitely make this again.  Something I would absolutely serve for company.

I made this and it was average.  The mushrooms had a nice flavor but the meat needs to marinate first and be cooked on a grill

This recipe turned out extremely well, I used london broil instead of flank steak and stayed with the recipe temps. and times, the only thing I did different was doubled everything else for extra sauce. Will make again.
