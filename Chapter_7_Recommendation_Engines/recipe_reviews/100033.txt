I was excited to find an frosting recipe that uses honey. This one was great, but I made a few changes the second time around. I made the white frosting. The vannila flavor was way strong. I skipped putting vannila completely the next time. The honey is a little strong too. I did 1/2 a cup the second time and next time I will probably cut it to 1/4 cup.

This recipe uses no sugar.  It has a nice texture and is very easy to work with.  I only frosted a single layer cake so I have plenty left.  I'm going to frost gob cookies with the leftovers.  Thank you Mrs. Ramey for a very different type of frosting.

This was just what I needed. My husband won't eat anything with white sugar in it but he's okay with honey. For his birthday I wanted to make a cake with frosting he could enjoy. I made the "white" version of this frosting and he loved it! Thanks!

I made the chocolate version, and the flavor is reminiscent of my grandma's coffee cloud pie topping (which I love, so I am also in love with this topping!). This is so good that I licked the bowl clean...and it makes a lot, so there was plenty left! So good!  Mrs. Michael Ramey - if you have any more recipes up your sleeve, please do share! It is quite hard to find recipes without refined sugar that taste this good!

Tried this recipe to go on a chocolate cake I had baked it I did not like it at all. It had this extra sweet (from the honey) but tangy flavor (from the cream cheese) that just didn't take good to me.

I made this without the cocoa, using the 1/2 cup of honey, and using light cream cheese (neufchatel) to put on carrot cake muffins. I have to admit, just tasting the frosting by itself, I didn't care for it. It had a strong tangy flavor from the honey and cream cheese. BUT....it tasted really good with the muffins. I would make this again, it was easy to make, light, and I love that there's no refined sugar in it. Plus my kids liked it!

I made the white frosting and I loved it.  It was light and loved that it didn't need any sugar.  I put it over a pumpkin cake.  Can't wait to make the chocolate frosting.

Great recipe! I actually used stevia instead of honey and used less cream to try for a low carb frosting that didnâ€™t have butter since I was using it on a low carb cake that used up all my butter. . Everyone loved it and it was very low carb. Yay! Keto friendly alternatives :)

So glad to finally find a recipe that uses honey instead of sugar! I made it exactly according to the recipe and it was perfect. This is now my favorite frosting!

love it, sweet, light, airy.  cream cheese and whipped cream make a great combo.  need to have stiff peaks on cream. refrigerate to thicken.

I've made this frosting without cocoa or vanilla to go with my carob cakes. I used other reviewers' suggestions and reduced honey to 1/2 cup. I also used raw cream. The frosting was wonderfully light. It went very well with the carob cake. There was enough to frost two single layer cakes. I gave it 4 stars only because of the excessive amount of honey in the recipe. Thanks!
