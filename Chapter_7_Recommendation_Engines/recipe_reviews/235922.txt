One of our favourite AR recipes. We were so impressed with this pork roast. The rub is delicious and we could taste it with every bite. We like our pork a little pink so we did adjust the time to suit ourselves. Only trouble we had was there seemed to be too much flour which thickened the gravy to a paste, hubby's first time at gravy so he added water and tried his best but the lumps were there. Didn't care cause it was best gravy ever! A million thanks for sharing this recipe! It will be a keeper! Yey KayDe5056 ! My 300th review on AR was a hit!

I really liked the spice rub on the pork, and the pork was tasty, but the gravy was way too salty. I thought for sure that the 1 tablespoon of garlic salt in the gravy had to be a mis-print, so I cut it back to 1 teaspoon and it was still too salty. We ended up rinsing the gravy off of our sliced pork and throwing away the gravy. Sorry, but I probably won't make this one again.

The flavor from the rub was excellent and the roast was juicy and very tasty.  I like my pork a bit more done, so will cook covered for longer next time.  After cooking as long as specified uncovered, most of the beer and juices had dried to the pan.  I added some water and a bit of butter and still had a great gravy!

This was way too spicy and I love spicy food. I followed the recipe exactly and I'm experienced in cooking. The meat tasted good once I scraped off the peppery part but the gravy was too peppery it overpowered the flavor.

This was yummy! I love a little kick, and cooking in beer added a great taste, and a kickin gravy. My whole family enjoyed it! The  pork was moist and tender, and made great sandwiches! My recommendation is to skip the garlic salt ( too much!) and salt to taste. Also may have more of a kick than some can handle, like my 91 year old Mom!

I tweaked this a little bit to my family's taste. Regardless, it made for one of the BEST pork roasts I have ever made!!!! I browned it in butter & then I rubbed it down. It was soooooo moist & flavorful! I could hardly believe how crazy good it was!!!

This was very good. My pork stayed juicy and the flavor penetrated throughout the meat. I made this with potatoes, carrots, and celery roasted in the same pan. My family enjoyed this as well and was good as leftovers the next day. I may lower the salt content the next go-around though (only as a personal preference, but I will definitely make this again.
