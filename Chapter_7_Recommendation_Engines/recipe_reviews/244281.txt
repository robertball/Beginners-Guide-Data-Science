I first made these one morning when I wanted to make breakfast sandwiches but didn't have enough egg rings. I used a pepper to make rings, cooked the eggs in a ring topped them with tomato & served on a English muffin. They were a hit! I have continued to cook my eggs this way, just be sure to make the pepper slice with one cut so that it lays flat in the pan so the egg doesn't leak out. I have also used onion rings. 5 stars because it is so simple, easy & good.

Very good idea!  I sauteed the pepper rings in a non-stick pan with a little bit of grapeseed oil on medium low heat to soften them before adding eggs.  Sprinkled with salt n' pepper and topped with a tablespoon of shredded cheddar cheese.  Covered pan with glass lid and continued cooking on med.-low to melt cheese and baste eggs.  Turned out perfect!!

Read the flipping and leaking problem. I used a little canola spray and then fried the pepper a bit (about a minute) and then added the egg. This seemed to take care of the leak. For those who like their eggs 'over easy', I just took the pan lid added added a little water (like a tablespoon or two) to the pan and covered it. The steam generated results in an over easy egg. The longer you leave it, the more it cooks. Ya might wanna give this a try.

A great idea, but with modifications. Get the largest peppers you can, cut them into 1/2 to 3/4 inch rings. Use small eggs, not jumbo's. I also add diced tomatoes, and diced ham inside the pepper ring, a kind of western with a yolk, and don't flip them, after a few minutes when the bottom is set, turn heat to low/warm, cover pan and cook to desired doneness ! I added chourizo in lieu of ham for my more adventuresome friends, actually, anything works, just cut to appropriate size, and cook item ahead if needed, i.e., mushrooms, sausage, etc..

Made this many times for company.  I also buy extra large eggs, so I just cut the pepper thicker to contain it.  Also use a large onion for onion rings.  Using onion rings and different colors of peppers makes for a festive presentation or use just red and green for Christmas, or just red for Valentine's, etc.  Do cook the peppers and onions ahead of time and cover the pan with a lid.  If you do this, you will not have to flip them.

Loved the *idea* of this 'recipe'. I tried this a while back, before I saw this recipe. Your success will all depend on your personal preferences, re: how much you like to cook your peppers, and how,  and how much,  you like to cook your eggs...not to mention such domestic engineering feats as the size of the pepper, the size of the egg, whether the egg leaks out under the pepper ring, whether your nonstick skillet is *truly* nonstick, ETC. I would actually like to try this again with scrambled eggs...whisking the eggs together first, then pouring into the pepper rings. Then I could control the amount of egg in each! PS: I always had trouble flipping an egg without breaking the yolk, until, duh, just the other day, after cooking for more years than I care to count, I sprayed my utensil with Pam *before* I attempted the flip!

These are so much fun to make and to look at!  I love it!  I cooked the pepper a little on both sides before adding the egg, just to make sure it got soft enough.  Served with a side of bacon, perfect breakfast :)

If your egg is too much for the pepper ring line the pepper ring with a slice of ham & bake in the oven at 350 for 15 - 20 minutes, top with 1/4 processed cheese slice during last 5 minutes of cook time!! Delish!

I did not make any changes, only on the cooking method. I cut the red pepper rings thicker so they held the complete egg. I sautéed the rings slightly on both sides, then added the eggs, seasoned them and put a teaspoon of finely grated cheese on top. After two minutes in the pan I popped it under the grill to melt the cheese an set the egg on top.  Served on toast, the egg yolk was still soft and they were delicious.

I liked the idea of cooking the egg inside the pepper because I figured it would serve the purpose of an egg ring. I don't have egg rings because they only do one thing and Alton Brown taught me to never buy a gadget that doesn't multitask. So peppers will work. I have two tips to add: the first is make sure you consider the size of the pepper you are using. If they are too small the egg won't fit inside and will overflow. The second tip is to make sure to cook the pepper for a few mins to soften it before you crack the egg inside. This is a cool way to make eggs, but mine didn't come out like the picture  on the recipe. I plan to try again soon.

So slice the pepper rings thicker if the egg is overflowing.  Common sense.

Tasted great! The only thing that wasn't perfect was that the egg is always slightly too large for the pepper and some of it squeezes through the bottom and out the sides, but this also may be because I buy extra large eggs

I really like this simple recipe. The pepper makes a great presentation as well as an added flavor to the fried egg. Great to make for an easy brunch side or a mid-day snack. I think to elevate it even further would be to place the pepper rings on the grill first, then transfer to a skillet to add the eggs. Next time!

We have been doing this for years, sometimes putting some ham in the bottom and using thicker bell pepper slices than shown. My tip is do NOT try to flip this. After it cooks nearly to desired doneness, add just a tb or two of water to the pan and put on a lid for a minute or less. I never flip eggs.

Flip, schmip .... how is it that, apparently, 80% of the world does not know the egg cooking technique known as BASTING !!!!  This is a very good, fun and easy recipe when a couple of simple steps are used,  One: saute the pepper/onion rings in a tbs of EVOO, baste by adding a tbs (+/-) water and cover!  Add whatever you want ..... cheese ,ham, bacon etc..  Enjoy!!

I used teaspoon of oil and butter because I love that flavor in cooked eggs. Would recommend a larger pepper then I used but it can out tasting great! Definitely cook the pepper and flip it for a couple minutes on each side. It helps to soften it and prevents leakage of the egg when you pour it in the pepper ring.

If you have a problem with the ring being to small for the amount of egg, then cut a larger ring  (thicker) DUH! This was really good.

Yup, this recipe is right up there with the fabulous egg in a hole featured as one of your recipes. It may be a good way to teach little kids how to use a fry pan and spatula.

I had the same problem as another reviewer. The eggs were too much for the pepper rings to hold and they came out the bottom and over the top. This made it tricky to flip them. Otherwise this was ok.

Simple and quick way to make a healthy breakfast! I would recommend cooking the pepper a little in the pan before adding the egg. I used a glass lid on my pan to cook the eggs in the centre and I added green onion to mine it was delicious!

Pretty and fun! I microwaved the pepper rings for about a minute to soften them a little. I had just a little egg leak under the pepper but not much. After cooking the eggs on medium heat for 2 minutes, I steamed the eggs like one person suggested. It  was spot on! I steamed them for a minute. They really looked over easy without having to flip them and they came out of the  pan so easy! Thanks! I will make this again.

I made mine a little differently, using all but the very top.  I added breakfast sausage and sliced green onions to it.  very tasty and a nice change.  FYI, you'll need to extend the cooking time, of course.

Super easy and fast! I made it just as written except I browned the pepper rings a few mins to soften them. It was delicious. The peppers were still a bit crunchy.

I cut the rings a little bigger, sauted them a bit on both sides, and topped them with fresh guacamole and a few drops of sriracha sauce. yum!

Easy to make. I followed the lead of other reviewers and added a bit of water then covered the pan allowing the eggs to cook more thoroughly. I added shredded cheese and chopped green chiles to the top, letting the cheese melt before serving.  Sautéing the pepper ring a minutes or two in olive oil before adding the egg makes the ring a bit more tender.

The first time I made it as submitted. Just made it again today with peppers mushrooms and onions. Topped it with cheese. Yum and great presentation.  Next time going to cut pepper slices larger and try hashbrowns on the bottom with other goodies. Easy and fancy dancy presentation.

Love a spin on regular ingredients we already have on hand. Note that if your pepper isn't sliced so that the whole thing is flush on the pan the egg white will leak out. Still tastes great but not picture perfect.

Everyone enjoyed the taste/flavor, but the appearance was not very appealing!  No matter how hard I tried to cut the slices straight,  the egg kept oozing out somewhat, so the end result was not quite perfect.  I did sauté the pepper slices before adding the eggs, so that may have softened the peppers and allowed the eggs to 'escape'.

This is an awesome fast recipe that is delicious we grow our own Peppers so it is even better. There are many ways you can either spice it up or tone it down do whatever you want with it. I highly recommend it delicious and fast as I said.

fun way to make an egg - I cut the pepper ring a little too thick so maybe next time I will stick the pepper ring in the microwave for 30 seconds before  placing it in the pan -  a little hot sauce would be good on it as well

I did precook the pepper a bit and served it on buttered toast....Made a fast, easy and nutritious breakfast.  Will do this often.  I will, however, slice my pepper in a larger round and not try to flip it.

This recipe takes some fooling with, and when I am finished with that, I may raise the review rating to a 4.  First try leaked from the bottom, tho I had cooked the ring for about a minute, but it tasted good.  I put a slice of havarti cheese on top and cooked for 6 minutes.  Next try, I cooked the pepper slice for a bit longer than a .minute first, still leaked.  Actually, I don't care if it leaks.  I cooked it for 4 minutes, was still a bit harder than I like.  I'll try this recipe again, reducing cooking time.  I didn't flip.  I would suggest using a green or red pepper, since the gold ones give you no color contrast at all.

Fun to make and they look really cool.  I did fry my pepper slices several minutes on each side before adding the eggs. Slices may have been thicker than 1/4 inch, didn't measure but I knew they were big enough to each hold an egg. Just have to estimate based on the size and shape of your pepper. One ring leaked a small amount but bottom set quickly and stopped the leak. No problems flipping, thanks for a unique recipe, I will make again.

If you crack your egg in to a strainer the really loose watery part of the egg drains away and you then pour the egg into the pepper ring. Little or no leakage! This is a great way to poach and fry eggs as well. I think the confusion in this recipe was that the pepper is used for the ring and not a metal egg ring. Love these with a little parmesan and Italian seasoning.

There are clearly a lot of people who were able to master this recipe, I am not one of them.. I have tried to make this recipe multiple times and have never succeeded. My pepper will be cut so that it lays completely flat, and the egg will still leak out from underneath and I am never able to get it to flip once the bottom is cooked without making a huge mess.

I will make this again, but need to find a way to avoid a crispy bottom on the egg, and still not have it leak out. Very clever recipe, thank you!

Preparing it as instructed, it didn't work well. With extra pre-prepping (which cancels the "quick n easy" factor ) it has potential. I will not be preparing this again.

It was different. The peppers really added flavor to the eggs. My husband loved it though; so I consider it a win!!

Buy small eggs for this. That is what I so for English Muffins so it would be the same principle.
Great healthy meal for campers.

The four is an "averaged out" vote.  It's really a 5 for the idea and a 3 for the ability to execute easily.  It's true that cooking the pepper ring in the skillet a little bit before adding the egg helps to prevent leaking.  The problem is flipping it.  For one thing, the egg sort of settles down onto the skillet and  pulls away from the pepper.  Secondly, when you flip, you destroy the beautiful yellow color (that matches an orange pepper) and the whole thing gets whitish and, if you cook for more than 15 seconds or so, even brown.  Probably the best bet is to put a lid over the whole pan at the beginning in order to whiten the top of the egg.  As I was using a very large skillet, I didn't have such a big lid to fit it.   It will take practice for my egg to look as pretty as the picture.  One more thing: It is really important to cut your pepper ring no thicker than 1/4 inch  and to cook on fairly low heat, without getting the bottom overly crisp.  Otherwise you'll have a crispy brown bottom, a wet middle, and -- either a
