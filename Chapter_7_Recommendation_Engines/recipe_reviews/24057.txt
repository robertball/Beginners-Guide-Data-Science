I wanted to make something unique for Memorial Day desert and thought ice cream might be the answer.  This was so easy and the touch of cinnamon brought out the flavor of the chocolate.  The recipe made 3/4 of a gallon which surprised me.  My guests loved it.

We added ground up chocolate chips for extra chocolate and texture. It was very good and quite yummy. Very rich though!

This ice cream was very rich and easy to make.  I mixed the ingredients and chilled them in the fridge for a few hours then processed in my ice cream maker.   Next time I plan to leave out one can of the milk and add a pinch of salt to cut through some of the sweetness.

WOW!!!  I needed to use some whipping cream I had in the Fridge and happened upon this recipe by chance.  All I can say is YUMMY!  I love the hint of cinnamon... I added 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips and 1/2 cup chocolate chips.  I will be making this again!

I tried this and it turned out very well! All my guests liked it very much. I used 1 can of condensed milk instead of 2 and it turned out perfect.

This is DELICIOUS!  I had leftover whipping cream so I scaled down the proportions, but I added more cinnamon because I love the way it works with the cream and chocolate flavors.  The cinnamon and the sweetened cond. milk absolutely make this recipe my new favorite for leftover cream.  YUM.

WOW! This was really good. I halved the recipe down to "try it out"! I used my KA and didn't get stiff peaks to form, but once I added the sweetened condensed milk everything firmed up. I was very pleased with the results. I debated over the cinnamon because I'm not a huge cinnamon fan. I'm so glad I put it in, it gave a subtle flavor. This is very creamy. It is a tad rich, but that just meant it lasted longer in my house since we didn't fill the need to eat an entire bowl. I can't wait to make this again and try different mix-ins, like chocolate chips, oreos and brownie bites! Will definately make many more times as everyone in my house are icecream eaters, no matter the time of year.

A great ice cream recipe. My young nephews and niece really enjoyed it. I did as others suggested and only used 1 can of the sweetened condensed milk. I actually made some homemade chocolate syrup found on this site and used that in the recipe.

I made this tonight however I did a different version. Your recipe is great and leaves plenty of room to play if you like experimenting. This is really a simple recipe andthe only thing I did was us coconut milk and sugar instead of the sweetened condensend milk. Simple great.

I followed the recipe exact only leaving out the cinnamon as I do not like the combination of cinnamon and chocolate. This was incredibly simple--made simpler by using my Kitchen Aid mixer to whip the cream. (Most recipes do not tell you to chill your bowl and whipping attachment as well, I got that tip years ago and that tip has always made whipping cream much simpler.) This is so. freaking. delicious. I don't know that I will make this a lot because my family could not stop eating it. It's dangerous. Wonderful quick frozen "ice cream".

VERY GOOD!  I would describe this as a frozen chocolate mousse.  Very creamy but not quite enough chocolate for me which is an easy fix by drizzling chocolate syrup.  Thank you sal for sharing your recipe.

This is a pretty good recipe for us who don't always want to pull out the ice cream machine. I halved the entire recipe (only had one pint of heavy cream on hand) and it was very rich and sweet. Next time I plan to make a whole batch and omit one can of condensed milk like suggested. Also, now that Eagle Brand has out the new caramel and chocolate condensed milk flavors, I may try those as well (for the caramel one, I'd use caramel syrup and caramel sauce in place of the chocolates.) Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is so delicious! My boyfriend and I made it at his house and his whole family loved it. It's so simple yet it tastes so rich, creamy, and just amazing. The only change I made was omitting the cinnamon because I'm not that big of a fan of it. Just a really great recipe! I've made it multiple times!

This is really good ice cream, and easy to make. I took the advice of other reviewers and just used one can of condensed milk. I did not whip the cream. I just mixed all ingedients in a bowl and used poured into an ice cream maker. Turned out perfect!

the ice cream is super yummy but it's more of a frozen mousse than an ice cream, regardless this was amazing, I had left over brownies from this site the chocolate syrup brownies and cut them up into pieces threw them into the freezer and when the ice cream was almost completely frozen threw in the brownie pieces.... SO GOOD, my husband as well as co workers thought it was amazing and I got instant kudos. definitely a keeper

This was a pretty good basic ice cream that can be easily customized. I like that it does not require an ice cream machine! I recommend using an electric mixer to whip the heavy cream- takes a LONG time by hand! You can sometimes find a whisk adapter for hand mixers to make the whipping come out more smooth. I did find that it was a tad too sweet, so next time I'll use less sweetened condensed milk.
