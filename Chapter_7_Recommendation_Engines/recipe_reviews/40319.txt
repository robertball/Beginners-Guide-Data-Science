What a terrific recipe! Made this last night for my husband and he loved it. Said it would be perfect to serve when people come over. I pounded my chicken breasts first because they were kind of thick and had to increase the initial cooking time to 20-25 minutes because at 10 minutes, it was still very raw.  My picky daughter liked the chicken but without the nuts. She just doesn't like nutes period. Served over brown rice and with a granny smith apple/spinach/candied pecan salad. Again, very, very good. I love this site and everything I have prepared has received countless compliments.

The sauce for this recipe definately deserves 5 stars. The reason why I am going with 4 is that the cook time for the chicken seems a little short unless you pound the chicken breasts thin. I added more time to my cook time. In addition, next time I think I will try the cornstarch to thicken the sauce, I just don't want to change the taste of the sauce, it is excellent with chicken and rice. I also enjoy the flavor of the pecans! Thanks for a good recipe Brian!

With a few adjustments this is very good. The first time I found the 6 T. of Dijohn to be too overpowering, so I cut back to only 4 T. Also I added a little more honey. Don't use the ground mustard.  It would be way too mustardy!

Oh my. I'm sure my low rating is a reflection of our personal tastes and not the recipe itself.  Although we like all the ingrediants seperately, we just didn't care for the combined taste.  I just wish it tasted as good as it looked coming out of the oven.  Thanks anyways Brian.

Really good!  This tastes similiar to honey mustard chicken - I didn't think it tasted odd at all.  Every ingredient blends together and the chicken comes out juicy!  The only thing I would change would be to add a few tablespoons of cornstarch because the sauce is a bit too thin.

YUMMY! Made exactly as written and loved it! When my grandma was still alive this was one of her favorites so I made this a lot. I've never even altered it in any way like I eventually do with most recipes! So moist and flavorful it doesn't need any changes!

Sorry, we did not like this -- it was just way too sweet for our taste.  I'm giving it two stars because the first few bites were good, but after that we all had to force ourselves (some of us scraping off the sauce) to eat it.

This chicken was ok, nothing to really rave about.   Im glad that I scaled it back to 1 serving.  I increased the OJ buy a few tbsps, but even then the mustard was too strong.  If I make this again I will make a few changes: cut the dijon mustard in half, and add more OJ, maybe add more milk.  I would also add the pecans to the top so that they get crispy.

This was So.  Incredibly.  Good.  I had trouble not spooning up and eating all the sauce before I could even get the meal on the table. It's our new favorite.  The combination of mustard, OJ and honey was just right. Thanks!

My husband loved it, I couldn't eat it.  I think it was the tanginess of the mustard.  Next time I will use a much milder one.  Thanks though.

We love this recipe.  I have tried other pecan chicken recipes and the nuts often end up tasting burnt.  This one didn't, probably since you add the nuts for just the last 20 minutes. This made a delicious dinner served with a rice pilaf and a green salad.

I think the sauce could use a little less dijon mustard and more honey.  I would also add a teaspoon of cornstarch next time to thicken it up.  I thought this recipe was ok, but it needs something.

I made this tonight for dinner.  I was bit concerned because my husband is not generally a fan of mustard, but the mix of the orange juice, honey and mustard was perfect.  It was a big success and so easy to prepare that I'm sure I'll be making it again.

Served it with rice and a nice salad.
Plan to cut down on the mustard a bit when we make it again.

I couldn't decide whether to make this or not after reading all the reviews. I decided to make it but tasted the sauce before adding the mustard powder. I decided not to add it. The sauce is very thin upon coming out of the oven, but after it sits a bit, it thickens up and makes a nice sauce over rice. I like the crunch of the pecans in this dish.

I made this chicken for friends who came to dinner on Friday. It got rave reviews from everyone. I followed the suggestion to not use the dry mustard and I also double the sauce recipe. My kids have asked me to make this chicken for Christmas dinner. Definitely a new family favorite.

Very good. I had been looking for a recipe to use up some pecans that I had left over when I found this recipe; I was skeptical about this while I was making it and took others' advice and added a bit of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. I did not have dry mustard but other than that followed the recipe and it really was good. It was not too sweet and I really loved the chopped nuts as did my husband who usually shys away from recipes with dijon mustard. This one is worth making again. I would actually give it a 4 1/2 because it is not the best ever but it is much better than average and could be served to company.

very tasty! i used this recipe because it required a few random things that i had on hand (definately needed to go grocery shopping!) i made a few changes though. using some of the reviews, i modified the recipe like this: i used chicken thighs instead of breasts,a nd they came out juicy and delicious. i used honey mustard instead of honey and dijon mustard, and instead of oj i used 2 oranges that i had (makes about a cup... more than the recipe called for, but i usually use excess ingredients anyway). i didnt have milk, so instead i heated up the butter first and added 1/4 teaspoon of flour and let it cook for a minute before adding the other ingredients. i didnt have lemon so i used juice from half a lime. i agree with other reviews that it came out a little too mustardy, would use 4 tablspoons next time. i seasoned chicken with adobo before initial baking, and the last 20 minutes i covered the chicken so the sauce wouldnt dry. turned out very tasty!!!!

Very good! I made this for Mother's Day and everyone enjoyed it. I would say that you can omit the butter. I did use the 2T called for here but if I make it again I'd leave it out.

Yummy!  Has a definite honey-mustard taste, but the pecans add a nice crunch.  I've used a similar recipe that was more of a pecan-encrusted chicken.  But, this was much easier to just dump the sauce and nuts on top (since they fall off anyway.)  We served it with mashed potatoes.  If you use rice, I might double the sauce so you have extra on the rice.

This is a favourite among all my guests. I don't tend to serve it over rice, but that would be fine. Even mustard-haters seem to like this one!

This dish was good. I ran out of dijon mustard, so I used a combination of Coney Island style mustard and  premade honey mustard. Overall, not bad, although it was extremely unattractive. I also gave it four stars because it satisfied my mother, who is extremely picky.

This dish is heaven! I love the fusion of Pecans and Dijon Mustard. This recipe is in my "keeper" recipe box.

Very easy to make but the taste was nothing special.  Followed the directions to a "T". If I make again, I would use almonds instead of pecans per my taste.

This sauce is absolutely delicious over boneless chicken breasts.  I only had cashews in my pantry, so I crushed them in place of the pecans.  My husband loved the nutty, citrus sauce this recipe made.  I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to company.  Wonderful!

This is the best dijon recipe that I have ever had! I only made a few changes; left out the milk and substituted orange marmalade and also did not use the pecans.

Loved it! After reading reviews did a few things: Dijon mustard down to 5 tbls, 1 tsp cornstarch thickens sauce and won't change flavor profile, 2tsp brown sugar- turned out yummy. Next time may add 6tbsp Dijon since brown sugar upped the sweet. Definitely eating in near future!

Great taste, and my favorite thing about this recipe is I already had everything I needed to make it.  Very easy to follow and I had time for laundry and floors in between cooking times.  I cooked the chicken 14 minutes at first, then 25, but I'm sure that varies with everyone's appliances.  As far as my family's vote, they loved it!  My five year old ate every last bite (of course he is accustomed to eating whatever his parents are having), but my picky not-a-big-fan-of-chicken hubby cleaned his plate.

Delicious and loved how easy it was! I added a little cornstarch to thicken up the sauce a bit and added a less of the Dijon mustard as other reviewers suggested. I was torn whether or not to save a few for friends to try. I ended up eating it all!

Good recipe, I made a few suggested changes. I used less mustard and more honey. I didn't add any lemon juice, because i thought it might contrast with the orange juice. I also added a splash of maple. I seasoned the chicken too. It was delicious.

I don't like to comment unless I follow the directions and ingredients. I did with this one and, well, I just don't think the flavors mixed very well. The chicken was very tender. Maybe too much mustard, maybe walnuts rather than pecans,

I really liked this recipe. It was very easy and quick. I followed it pretty acurately and the only thing I needed to change was to allow for about 10 more minutes in the oven. On the downside I found it to be a bit too rich, but thats to be expected due to the ingredients. Still very good anyways, thank you!

So good and so easy! I made it exactly as the recipe, even though some reviewer comments said they thought it was a little too sweet or too orange, but I really liked the interesting flavor. My husband also loved it and said it was 5 star. I served with plain white rice.

My confession right up front is that we are mustard fans in this family, so the taste of the sauce was excellent (with both the Dijon and the ground mustard). I pounded the chicken breasts to make them thinner, and the cooking time was then as indicated in the recipe. This is a tasty, easy-to-prepare recipe that is going into my recipe box.

Good flavor.  I had made something similar to this with orange juice and dijon mustard, so the mustard flavor did not bother me.  I did not add the powdered mustard, and added a little bit more oj and honey.

This turned out to be very good, but I had to increase the cook time.  I used 2 chicken breast halves, which I had cut into thirds.  I ended up cooking it for about 40 minutes.  It still turned out very juicy and delicious.  When I pulled it out of the oven, my 3 year old said, "Eew, that doesn't look very good!"  But he gobbled it up anyway!

This was a moist tasty chicken and it was so easy, I had my 10 year old daughter mix the ingredients. I added some chicken broth for more flavor and some starch in the mix to add thickness. I may experiment with this receipe a little more and possibly add some garlic next time. Seems like it needs some herb for more flavor.

Enjoyed this delicious new way to serve chicken.  I only used 3 large chicken breast halves and cut them in half, but did not change other ingredients.  We like lots of sauce!  As recommended by others, I sprinkled some parsley on top for added color after dish came out of the oven.  Also, loved the crunch of the pecans.  Definitely a keeper.

This was a very easy chicken dish to make and even better than that, it wasn't like all the other chicken dish recipes I have.  I wasn't sure if my family or I would like it because of the pecans and glaze ingredients, but it was very tasty.  I served it with rice and a salad and it will definitely take a space in my "quick and easy meals" recipes.

I thought the flavor of this sauce was great! I did add more honey than it calls for, and I only used 4 chicken breasts. Other than that, it was great over rice. I will cook this again for sure!

Excellent!  My husband and I both loved it.  Great combination of flavors and the chicken was very moist.  I added a bit of cornstarch to thicken up the sauce and cooked the chicken in the sauce the whole time (about 40 minutes) it turned out great.

This was a really good recipe and very simple. The sauce was easy and delicious and got better with age, so making the sauce ahead of time and throwing it together with the nuts and chicken would be very handy on a weeknight. The leftovers made excellent chicken salad the next day. I did sub cashews for pecans as my mom doesn't like pecans and I was making this for dinner with them. The cashews were great and I'll use pecans next time I make this. It paired nicely with a classic mac and cheese. Definitely a winner that I'll make again.

Yes I changed it and it was awesome! I simplified this by usung just 3 tbsp honey & 1/2 cup dijon mustard. Foil lined pan using thin breasts at 350 for 45 min in the oven. Yum!

I made it as written except I cut the chicken breast in 1/2 only because I find portions of breast meat large. Will definitely make again.

The bones of this recipe are good. It is easy to prepare. The sauce is runny. I removed a bit of the sauce after the chicken was cooked and made a cornstarch slurry, added it to the sauce to thicken up. It helped. I opted out of the mustard powder and I used bone-in chicken. Served over brown rice and veggies. My crew enjoyed it.  Thanks Brian

Maybe it was me but the mix of honey and dijon flavor did not combine well. Perhaps it was the brand of honey I used.

Excellent recipe, easy to put tgether and a wonderful flavor. The pecans add a nice texture contrast. I used the chopped pecans in the sauce and after it was done, topped each serving with a few pecan halves.

I was excited when I found this recipe because it sounded good & different and I already had the ingredients on hand. However as soon as I tasted it I knew I wouldn't be making it again. The sauce itself is okay, but the pecans ruined it. The texture and flavor was too overpowing. I ended up scraping them off and straining the remainder of the sauce. I'm not sure if perhaps toasting them would help? Unfortunately I just didn't care for this recipe.
