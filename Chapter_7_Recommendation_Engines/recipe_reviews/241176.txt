I'm so happy to see a gluten free recipe using various flakes instead of oats. A nice gluten free crisp. I added a 1/2 cup of frozen mixed berries just because I needed to use them. I also had to use buckwheat flakes instead of rice flakes. We liked the end result but next time I will cut down on the sugar in both the mixture and the topping. The brown sugar really adds a nice earthy flavour and crunch to the topping. Thank you Kathy for sharing your recipe!

I made this for my mom who is gluten intolerant. It was one of several desserts at the gathering and was the most popular. I used the rice flour as in the recipe but used oatmeal instead of quinoa. Also used apples but always make sure at least one apple is a different variety. It adds depth to the flavor.

Very good and was loved by person needing gluten free, she had seconds. A tip I learned was to make with a variety of apples.

I love that something gluten free didnâ€™t taste gluten free. Though with all the butter and sugar we had major heart burn. Made it again with only 1 tablespoons sugar, 2 tablespoons brown sugar and only 2 tablespoons butter and sprinkled a bit of gluten free granola on top for crunch. Also added walnuts.
