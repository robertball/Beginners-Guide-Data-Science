We liked this dish very much, I cut the recipe in half. I think when I make this again I will try using both cans of corn it wasn't corny enough for me.

I used fresh broccoli florets and used the exact size dish and the broccoli was practically raw so not sure if you need use frozen broccoli instead. Also, as the other reviewers have noted there ALOT of flavor missing in this dish. I added garlic powder and it still didnâ€™t turn the dish around. I will not be making this again.

I cooked this on the stove. Boiled the brocolli and added it to the rest of the ingredients. I added a little cayenne pepper and powdered garlic for flavor. I also topped it with shredded cheddar cheese. Cheap, quick, and tasty meal.

So  decided to try this dish. Got it together and realized I did not have crackers. I used roasted garlic and sea salt chips. Very tasty! Will do it again using the actual needed ingredients. Thanks for posting this.
