I've been making this recipe for about 3 or 4 years now with one exception. Instead of making a glaze, I allow the cookies to cool then roll them in powdered sugar, only because the glaze is messy and takes too much time to apply and let cool. I can never make enough to keep on the plate!!

The bomb.. awesome cookie. Texture wise and taste wise. I used real rum instead of extract and topped with some walnuts

Such delicious, light, airy cookies! Next time I'll roll the cookie dough in powdered sugar before I bake...I love sweet cookies! Everyone who tried these loved them. So easy to make-- not many ingredients.

I made these cookies for a holiday cookie exchange, & they were a big hit. They are a shortbread type cookie with the rum glaze. Very good & fairly easy. I used real rum instead of extract & I only had half the amount of butter so I did half butter & half coconut oil. It worked great. It may have changed the consistency a bit, because I didn't need to roll into a ball, I just made "patties" with my hands & placed them on an un greased cookie sheet, which made wonderful cookies.

Amazing! I'm shocked that more people haven't given this recipe a try.  It is simple, but so impressive in taste and texture.
