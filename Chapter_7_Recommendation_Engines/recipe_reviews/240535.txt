I couldn't bring myself to boil all those lovely spices so I went about this a bit differently. I toasted all the spices over medium heat. When they became fragrant I added about a tablespoon of EVO and mixed then added the onion and minced garlic and saut√©ed until tender and translucent. I added the water and broth along with the lentils and followed the recipe from there until we got to the kale and peas. I steamed those separately to retain their bright green color. I did mix the peas into the grain mixture and served it over the kale. The other change I made was to use regular quinoa since there is neither nutritional advantage nor additional flavor in the rainbow and it was almost twice as expensive. When I saw how muddy this cooked up I was happy with that decision. Thank you Heather.

Very tasty! I did take the advice of one of the other reviewers and toasted my spices before adding come EVOO and continuing on from there. It takes a bit to make so I would either save for the weekends or on a weeknight when I have a bit more time in the evenings. Very flavorful and filling. I will be making this again.

This is a good recipe and we'll probably make it again. It did take longer to cook than the recipe called for.

Found there was to many spices in this recipe and many cancel each other out. Also you can adjust the water amount depending if you want it looser or dryer. Mine came out very mushy with the water as the recipe says.
