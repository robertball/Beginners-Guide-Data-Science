Tasty! I do feel it needs a bit of salt and pepper, or a drizzle of evoo or basalmic vinegar to 'brighten' up the flavors a bit. I just added the salt and pepper, and that was fine for us. We liked the addition of the black olives, making it different from the usual caprese salad. I would make this again, b/c we love these types of salads! Thanks for sharing. :)
