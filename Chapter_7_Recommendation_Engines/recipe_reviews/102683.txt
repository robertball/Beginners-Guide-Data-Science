Instead of using canned pie filling, we just cut up apples and mixed with the usual sugar and spices.  It smells great when baking nad is very tasty.

If BBQ sauce isn't your thing, replace with 1/4 cup of maple syrup!

**yum**

For the taste of my family, adding bar-b-que sauce to this dish was a detraction.  Perhaps it depends on the brand of bar-b-que sauce used.  However, for us, the bar-b-que sauce ended up dominating a little too much.

I enjoyed this recipe.  I used several small ham steaks instead of one big ham.  I did however think that the mustard/BBQ mixture was a little too contrasting to the sweet.  Maybe next time I would just cut down the amount.  I will make this again.

This was pretty good.  The whole family liked it.  One daughter didn't like the apples served on the side though.

I made this for Easter lunch for my family exactly as the recipe was given. I don't know which was more of a hit, the ham or this topping!  My brother didn't want any leftover ham unless I scraped the pan for the rest of the apples!! Yummy...I will make this again!

I really, really enjoyed this.  So simple!  My first "sweet" ham as I usually just cook mine in a can of coke.  The sweet apples paired nicely with the tangy-ness of the BBQ sauce and mustard.
