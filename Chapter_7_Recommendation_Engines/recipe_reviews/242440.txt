I didn't have frozen corn, so used can in place of it.  I skipped the cooking part for corn altogether.   Next time hopefully I can use the fresh, but I doubt I will add the sugar to it as we try to avoid the stuff.  Very nice fresh salad with plenty to spare.  The shrimp as recommended from another reviewer were put on skewers and basted with the BBQ sauce.  Everything turned out delicious.

What was the measurement for the granulated sugar? And what would be the best to pair this wonderful salad with?

This was fine. I would cut back on the amount of black pepper in both side items. Just really overpowered the dish for the family.

I have not made this yet; but it sounds like a dish we would really like. How much sugar is used for the Citrus Corn Salad?

Didn't use the BBQ sauce, used fresh corn, huge hit in the house and just enough corn salad left for a lunch tomorrow.
