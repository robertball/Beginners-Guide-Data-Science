Utterly delicious! The only thing I changed was halving the butter to 2 Tablespoons. This was still so creamy & rich, I could've further reduced, or left out, the butter, and it would still be as tasty. Since we prefer a higher ratio of vegetable to fat, I'll probably add more corn & green chile next time. To those contemplating whether to make this or not, definitely do! I would try this with frozen or fresh corn, & with Neufchatel, a lower-in-fat cream cheese. These few changes won't compromise the delicious factor. --- UPDATE: I tried this again, with only these changes to the recipe: I used Neufchatel cream cheese, so the texture still was very creamy. I left out ALL the butter; I wouldn't suggest doing that as we did miss the rich, extra-buttery taste. So if you want a lower in fat version, do try Neufchatel & use only half the butter=perfect!

Sooooooooooo fattening, but I swear it's worth every calorie! (I've never used french fried onions before and was horrified when I read the nutrition information)  I left out the green chilis in consideration of my 2 year old.  I think this would have been very good either way.  I did think it could use a bit of salt.  I just sprinkled a little on top of my serving and that was fine, but next time I think I'll try adding 1/4 tsp.  Note: In spite of the fat, DON'T skip the french fried onions, as they definitely add texture and flavor.

VERY creamy/soupy-didn't care for the texture, just too cream-cheesy. Glad I tried it but probably won't make again. Sorry:(

My husband made this for his office potluck and I had a little nibble of it.  I loved it!  We agree with the previous reviewer that said that it does not fit in a 1 quart dish.  We also only used about 1/2 the french fried onions because to use the full amount seemed like too much to both of us.  We will definately be making this for Christmas dinner this week!

My family really loved this one - I will make it again.  It is definitely very creamy and even a little runny, but the flavor is nice, especially if you use "sweet" canned corn.  One thing to note: the recipe says to cook this in a 1 quart casserole dish, but the mixture does NOT fit in a 1 quart dish!  I used a 2 quart dish which worked just fine.

This dish was excellent.  I skipped the green chiles, although I would add them if I were serving this dish with a Mexican meal.  I also skipped the fried onions because I was not in the mood for too much onion flavor.  Great recipe!

Pretty good.  My youngest said this is one of her favorite things to eat now.  I did omit the green chilies, since my two girls are a bit picky and wouldn't have touched it if they saw it in there.  An interesting alternative to the green bean casserole.

I just found this recipe and made it for both a work Thanksgiving and a family Thanksgiving.  It's been a while since I received so many compliments on a baked dish.  The only complaint was there was not enough!  I did add garlic--you can never have too much garlic!  I also substituted 1/2 of the french onions with the cheddar flavored onions.

Creamy and delicious! This vanished very quickly from the dinner table. It is simple to make and will become one of my staple recipes.

I made this according to the recipe with two minor exceptions.  I left out the peppers, and I sauteed the onion in a little butter before adding it to the mix.  It is delicious, but way too fattening to eat on a regular basis.  We will save this for the occasional splurge.

One of our favorite side dishes. It is a MUST to double the entire thing to have enough for leftovers. We don't change anything, and make it exactly as written.

This was fantastic!  I used one whole 8 oz package of cream cheese instead of the 2 smaller ones.  I also left out the onions because I had no fresh ones.  Makes a great side dish to go with a mexican dinner!

Made this for Thanksgiving and EVERYONE loved it.  My 4 year old nephew ate three servings and my husband asked me to make it before next year.  The only change I made was fat free cream cheese.  Next time I'll add a little more corn.

I've always skipped the peppers and added some shredded cheddar cheese and a dash of onion salt, ceelery salt, and garlic salt. Always a hit at holidays.

I'd say this is a take it or leave it kinda dish...not bad but I didn't think it was excellent!  I didn't do the onion rings on top since I took it for work and they would've been soggy by then, but I don't feel they would've added a whole lot!

What a treat! Being a little conscious of calories i used reduced fat cream cheese and a little less of the butter. Somehow I managed to pick up a can of jalapeños instead of green chili peppers and WOW! What a jazzy spicy little side this turned out to be! So yummy! Ill make it again and try the green chili's but if its Mexican night ill keep the jalapeños! Its a must try!

I made this for a potluck for Thanksgiving.  I think I may have done something wrong as it didn't turn out as well as I thought it should have.  Maybe I'm not a cream cheese type of guy. Also not a great cook (lol).

Left out chilie peppers (didn't have them) and added 5 slices chopped bacon.  Followed another reviewers suggestion to use lower fat cheese and half the butter and it was still amazing.  Great side dish!

I brought this to my book club and everyone loved it.  I got many requests for the recipe - I did not have have chilis so I just subbed some cayenne pepper, used less cream cheese and chopped onions and it was perfect.

My family LOVES this corn casserole.  It is so tasty and amazing, everyone takes seconds and there are no leftovers.  This is saying a lot because there are some very picky boys around here!

I found out at the last minute that I was going to be hosting a barbecue this evening. I quickly threw this together, only having 2 cans of creamed corn and no niblets. I omitted the chile's. This turned out great!!! I baked it a bit longer and my guests absolutely loved it. There was a tiny bit leftover and a guest asked if they could take it home!!! Thanks.

My boyfriend and I absolutely love this corn casserole!  I use the 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it turns out perfect every time.  Takes a little longer to cook than the recipe calls for.

I didn't use the french fried onion because I don't like them that much, but I kept everything else the same. The end result was a little intense on the creaminess factor, (I kept referring to it as "super creamed corn") but overall I liked it. I've had better corn casseroles, but this one was pretty good.

I fixed this recipe for my family for the first time and everyone just went crazy over it.  It was like I reinvented corn or something.  It really makes a wonderful side dish.

I've made this corn casserole twice, for Christmas and for Memorial Day. It paired well with the prime rib on Christmas and it went great with The BBQ Ribs on Memorial Day. I'm not a measurer, I look at the ingredients and just put it together and, knock on wood they have turned out pretty good. I used 1 16oz bag of frozen whole kernal corn and 1 can of cream style corn and 1 8oz pkg of cream chez along with the rest of the ingredients.

I am always reluctant to make an internet recipe for the first time for purposes of sharing it with a bunch of other people. I didn't have time for a trial run though, and this recipe was everything the reviews promised it would be. I didn't omit anything, but I did make a few additions/alterations: I used red onion, and I sauteed it in olive oil with garlic and 1/2 of a red bell pepper (all chopped up) for just a little bit. I did add quite a lot of garlic, maybe like 3 tablespoons. I decreased the amounts of butter and cream cheese (I did use neufchatel) and added roughly 3 ounces light sour cream. The green chilies I used were fire roasted. I couldn't find the smaller-size cans of corn, so both the cream style and the regular corn were the 15 ounce size- with the regular corn being white and yellow together. Perhaps having more corn in it helps it to not be soupy. This was a HUGE hit at my church's thanksgiving dinner, and I am really looking forward to making it again.

Yummy! Every single person at Thanksgiving liked this. Definitely not healthy but a delicious treat for sure. Even better the next day (not that you'll have many leftovers!) I left out the chilies and it was still great.

Updated 2017: I have been making this for five years of Thanksgivings now! At a table of 30+ people nearly everyone loves it. I always leave out the chiles. Make it the night before, saving extra fried onions. Pop it in the oven the next day until it's bubbling, give a quick stir, throw on some fried onions and cook for five more minutes and you're done! I tripe the recipe and use only two 12 oz (usually less) fried onions .

This recipe was great.  I left out the green chile peppers and it still was awesome.  My family rave over it as well as appreciate a change from plain old corn in a bowl.  For me, I prefer this over any corn casserole with cornbread.

This had a good flavor, but was a little eggy for us.  We've since tried the Corn Pudding (also on this website) and were thrilled with those results.  We'll probably stick with that one.

I had all of the ingredients on hand, so I decided to try this.  It was good, but not spectacular.  If I make this again, I will use about half of the amount of french fried onions.  Some sweet red peppers or pimento would add a little color, too.

Used 3 cans of corn (2 reg and 1creamed).  Halved the French onions and butter.  Added half can of  Rotelle instead of the chiles.  The extra red color made a Lovely Xmas dish.  Not soupy at all and a little less fat.  Yum!

Too much cream cheese and shouldn't have used butter - way too oily and had to siphon some and put crushed crackers in to soak up the rest. I increased the recipe to 16 servings. I would only used 1 pkg. cream cheese and no butter, but would saute onions in a little oil. Then for that amount of servings we used 3 cans corn and I would use only 1 can cream corn. We loved the green chili peppers in it.  We'll go back to the recipe with corn muffin mix next time but add the chili peppers.  NO French Fried onions. There's enough onions in the recipe.

This is very tasty, and I did give it five stars, but it's definitely better as a side dish, or even a dip. It's very creamy.  Because it was a casserole, I guess I figured it would be good as a main dish, but it's a tad sweet to have too much.

This was a good recipe.  It went well with barbeque, not the normal corn on the cob.  I grated a large onion in it to give it more flavor.

This was excellent.  My son thought it was the best corn casserole he ever had.  I used 2 large fresh roasted chili peppers instead of canned.  It put a little bite in it.
