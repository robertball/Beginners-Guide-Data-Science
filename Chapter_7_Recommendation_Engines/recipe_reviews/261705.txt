In the ingredients list, there no carrot amount! But in the instructions, says to add the carrot with the celery, parsley, etc. I did add carrot, the same amount as the celery. I thought it tasted very good. Housemate didn't. Don't know if will make again.

I added some chili powder, red pepper flakes, and some lemon to the recipe which I think increased the overall flavor. The recipe is nice for a simple and easy soup on a cold day.
