When I originally submitted this recipe, I included several tips for easy dipping which were apparently edited out,like crushing cookies in the blender, chilling shaped balls before dipping, etc. Looks like most people figured it out on their own though!  Any leftover white bark coating is great mixed with a little peanut butter and dropped in small wafers on waxed paper to harden. They may stay slightly soft but just melt in your mouth, mmmm...
These are also great made with peanut butter sandwich cookies (cheap store brand work great)and using creamy peanut butter for part of the cream cheese and dip in milk chocolate coating.

Ok--I had great hopes for this recipe and as far as taste--they can't be beat.  But, when it comes to making balls and dipping them--I'm a total failure.  So I made it easier--I melted the chocolate and coated the bottom of a candy paper (like Reese's PB Cups) and then put the ball in and covered it with chocolate.  Much faster, better to look at than the balls with dripping chocolate everywhere and the taste is the same!  Great recipe!!!  No need for chilling the dough when you do it this way either!

OK...I stuck to the recipe...I used a processer to grind the cookies (you can eat 3 oreos before processing).  I mixed in the cream cheese and put it in the frig.  I made lots of small balls.  I had to use more of the vanilla candy coating (ALSO CALLED ALMOND BARK).  If my wife had not told me to look for Almond Bark I would not have found it.  Anywho...gggreattt.  Fantastic.  I took some to work so I would not get even fatter and many said they were the best of all time!  Fairly easy, very good, very fattening, tell the pig at work that they are cut off at five!

These should be renamed "Cookies and Cream Truffles"  Do definately use the food processor:  Throw all the sandwich cookies in the processor, puree, then throw in the softened cream cheese, let it go until is completely mixed.  Then refridgerate the dough!  You can make perfect balls in you do this.  I roll the balls, place them on wax paper on a tray in the freezer while I roll more.  Then I dip the chilled balls.  It's not very speedy but they look nicer.

I've been making these for years - I call them "Oreo Truffles".  I also drizzle melted milk chocolate over them for presentation (which also hides any mistakes you've made when dipping).  I have also made them dipped in milk chocolate, drizzled with white chocolate -they're very pretty.  Wonderful recipe!

Took these to our Christmas party. Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe. Dipped mine in white candy coating and placed in red mini cupcake papers on green dish. Looked like a lot of work but was simple to do.

These are Awesome. Change it up a litle by using chocolate almond bark (candy coating) and mint flavored cookies.  Great for holiday parties!!

Wonderful!!!! I have made them 3 times already and everyone loves them.  I even had a 16 year old boy ask me for the recipe.  I rolled the balls and then put them in my freezer for 15 - 20 minutes.  When you dip them in the white chocolate they don't fall apart and the chocolate sets up very fast. Try them you'll love them!!!

These little balls of chocolate goodness are great.  And so easy.  No one believed that they were so easy to do.  I did refrigerate the mix before I made the balls.  I used a Pampered Chef small cookie scoop.  And I let the balls get cold before I dipped them.  I can't wait to put these on a Christmas cookie tray!!  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made these several times with different cookies (and semi-sweet, dark or white chocolate, rather than candy coating) and all were great - regular Oreos, Nutter Butters (subbing 1/3 C PB and some powdered sugar for some of the cream cheese) and Golden Oreos.  The big thing I've learned is that you DO NOT need an entire 8 oz package of cream cheese, otherwise the cream cheese flavor is overpowering.  Best to start with 1/3 to 1/2 of the 8 oz. brick and go from there.  Use a fork to cut it into the cookie crumbs until well mixed.  Keep adding cream cheese just until you get the right consistency of "dough" to form balls that will stick together.  To prevent the balls from falling apart, refrigerate the balls before dipping, and don't melt the chocolate at a temp any higher than 50% power in the microwave.  Mine come out looking quite smooth and pretty by using the fork and spoon technique of another reviewer.  Drop the ball into the melted chocolate, using a spoon to roll it around/spoon chocolate over it, then dump it onto a fork held in the other hand over the bowl.  Tapping the fork against the side of the bowl allows excess chocolate to fall through the tines before sliding it off onto the wax paper lined cookie sheet.  Refrigerating for at least an hour will allow them to set.  I love to make a batch and keep them on hand in the fridge for when I want a quick treat.  And people are always surprised when I tell them how easy they are to make.

If you like these cookie balls with the chocolate oreos, you MUST try them with the Golden Oreos! They are soooo good!! Next time I'm going to try using Nutter Butter cookies :) I use the food processor to crush the cookies, put them in a gallon size freezer bag with the cream cheese, squish it all together, freeze for an hour or so, then roll onto balls and place in the freezer until ready to dip. It works much better to dip the frozen balls that way the cookie doesn't ooze out of the chocolate.

I made these for the first time and the first couple of balls were slow until I got the hang of dipping them in melted chocolate.  I chilled them first as some reviewers suggested, then used a wooden toothpick instead of a fork to dip them.  I submerged the ball almost all the way to the toothpick (revealing some of the dough), then used a second toothpick to remove the ball.  Then I smoothed over the little "dent" on the top of the ball with a small touch of chocolate.  Perfecto!  The results were wonderful!  I can't wait to bring them to work tomorrow!  Thank you for a great-looking confection!

I've made these a couple of times now, and I always get rave reviews. The only complaint I have about them is that they don't last long enough! :) I've used both a candy coating and a bark coating, and I think I like the bark better. It coats them a little thicker, and offers more of a crunch before you get to the soft middle. I also chilled the balls before I dipped them in the coating, which made things much easier. They didn't turn out as pretty as I thought they would, but the taste more than makes up for that. Make sure you make enough to send some home with your guests, because I guarantee they will want to take some!! UPDATE: I used peanut butter sandwich cookies with the vanilla candy coating last time, and they turned out divine! 16 oz PB cookies, 8 oz cream cheese, and 8 oz creamy peanut butter. Wow!

These were fun to make and look very pretty, but i couldn't tolerate the taste.  you'd think the ingredients look like they'd go so wonderfully together, but they're sickeningly sweet and have a very odd texture.  they went pretty quickly because i think they look delicious, but i didn't receive a ton of great compliments either.  thanks anyway, but i won't mkae these again.

I made these before and followed the recipe exactly. Tonite the food processor went out so I put the cookies in a ziploc and took a frying pan to 'em.  It worked out great, although the crumbs were a little bigger than usual. Best part was, I felt really calm when I was done! Great recipe. Thanks.

I made these 3 times this month and they got eaten so fast with raving compliments.  I crushed cookies in the blender, and after rolling into balls, I put them in the fridge or freezer to chill, which makes them much easier to dip.  I just rolled them around in the chocolate (I used a bag of white choc chips), scooped out with a spoon, and plopped them on wax paper on a cookie sheet.  If the balls were in the freezer, the chocolate will harden quickly.  I also made these with peanut butter cookies and semi-sweet choc chips and they were also yummy!  Final tip: if the chocolate gets too hot it will become hard and clumpy.  At that point you can stir in a little canola/vegetable oil to return it to smooth texture - doesn't seem to affect the taste at all!  Enjoy!

Of all the different truffles I make, this one is not only the easiest, but one of the most loved!!  To make it even easier, I use a "truffle scoop" (it's 1/2 the size of a cookie scoop) to scoop out the individual balls - place on a wax paper lined cookie sheet and place them in the freezer for just a few minutes (flash freeze them).  Then to dip them in chocolate, I throw the ball of yumminess into the chocolate, fish it out with a fork, and allow the chocolate to drip off between the tines - then place back on the cookie sheet and sprinkle with additional crushed oreos.  I've been making truffles for years and once you get the hang of it, you'll get faster and faster.  I have also dipped these in milk chocolate and drizzled with white chocolate!  Either way - YUMMO!

These are amazing!  Would someone please advise me on how to store these.  I am giving them out at Christmas and I want to know if they need to be refridgerated after they set since they have cream cheese or if they can stay at room temp?

I made this for a cookie exchange last week and have been getting requests for it since. I used chocolate almond bark for the coating not vanilla and different cookies are fun to try like nutter butters or mint oreos. The easiest way melt the chocolate is a double boiler. Instead of crushing and mixing by hand I threw the cookies into the food processer and pulsed them until they were crumbs and then threw in the cream cheese and pulsed it till it formed a ball. Obviously if you pulsed it less it will be more of a chunky texture, which you may like. And last but not least, try to refrigerate the cookie/creamcheese mixture as much as possible because it becomes hard to work with when warm.

I made these for the first time and they turned out wonderful. I used my food processor for all of the Oreos and kept about 1/4 cup to the side. I rolled the balls and refrigerated for about 15 mins and then dipped them in almond bark using my metal egg white separator.  Then I sprinkled a little Oreo crumbs before they dried. Easy to make and very delicious.   Thanks for the recipe.

I made this reciped but instead of using chocolate cookies i used a package of nutter Butter ( peanut butter) cookies. I used a little more than half the cream cheese and added  1/2 cup creamy peanut butter to the mix- once rolled into balls I coated them with Melted Chocolate. these were a hit for my peanut butter lovers.

YUMMM!!  These are WAY too good and WAY too easy and WAY too easy to EAT!!  I used regular Oreos and Nestle Premier White morsels for the coating.  The dough was chilled at least an hour when I used the melon baller to make the balls.  They stayed together real nicely.  I heated the morsels in the microwave with 2 T of vegetable oil, stirring every 15 seconds and returning it to the microwave as it became a little hard.  I can't keep my hands off them.  Tell me ... do you think you can freeze these?  I'm really not sure.

These are great and surprisingly I prefer the white chocolate to a milk chocolate covered one. I actually already has some white chocolate mixed and melted with peanut butter and I used that to dip the cookie balls into it and I highly recommend trying melting peanut butter with the white chocolate.......the inside of these are flavorful and delicious. I didn't expect to love them as much as I do. I think they are best served cold.

This was very easy to make and my kids loved them.  I used chocolate candy coating and white candy coating (also known as almond bark).  I did put balls in the freezer to harden before coating them.  I did not find it hard to coat them like others did, but that could be because he make chocolate coated pretzels and peanut butter cracker every Christmas.  After putting them in the coating and making sure they were covered (used a spoon to scoop some coating over the top) I used a spoon to nudge them onto a fork and then tapped it lightly on the side of the bowl. Then I put them on wax coated paper and back in the freezer.  I keep them in the freezer in a freezer bag and pop them in my kids lunch for a special treat.   Yummy!

These were pretty good.  They taste more like candy or fudge than a cookie.  They must be kept refrigerated due to the cream cheese.  I made a triple batch for a Christmas cookie exchange I attended.  The "three ingredients" caught my attention when I was looking for recipes.  After I combined the cookies and cream cheese, I made the mistake of immediately rolling into balls and dipping into the chocolate.  But because the "dough" was by then room temperature they were breaking apart in the melted chocolate.  That's why it's imperative to work with cold/firm dough to make it work.  Once I did that it was pretty straight forward.  I used dark chocolate instead of white since I'm not a fan.  I would probably make these again.  Thanks Annette!

Delicious and super simple.  A little time consuming if you're a perfectionist and want them to be beautiful.  Everyone loved them and i was asked for the recipe several times. I did however reduce the cream cheese to 1/2 pkg. i had made my first batch with the full pkg as instructed and found them way too soft and mushy. With 1/2 pkg, i can make two different flavors with a pkg of cream cheese. Golden oreos and candy cane flavored ones are favorites.

These are very delicious little confections.  I used part semi-sweet chocolate chips and part Hershey's milk chocolate chips melted together with a little butter to make the shiny chocolate coating which tasted fantastic.  In the future though, I may either increase the amount of Oreo cookie crumb or decrease the cream cheese for a more delicate consistency.

I made this recipe with green and yellow candy melts for Super Bowl, and everyone loved them! This recipe is similar to one I had made many times before, which uses Bakers squares instead of candy melts. I prefer this one for melting ease (you can melt and re-melt as necessary) and flexibility (choose any color candy melts to match your party's theme). Freeze these before dipping so they stay firm. Also, a word of warning, if you are making this ahead of time: putting them in the refrigerator will make them wet-looking and sticky. I suggest making them shortly before serving them, or leave them at room temperature for a better display. I will be making these again and again.

Thought they were fantastic, and they were a huge hit with my mom's group.  I made cookie cups rather than cookie balls.  I put some of the melted white chocolate in the bottom of a foil mini cup. Then, I balled up and gently pressed some of the cookie mixture into the cup. Next, I poured more white chocolate till I fully covered the cookie mixture.  Lastly, I sprinkled some of the cookie mixture to decorate the top.  Loved them.

these were so AMAZing. i took more than four dozen of these to school for valentine's day - after less than 15 minutes, i only had ten! NOTE: if people are having trouble getting everything to stick, you probably didn't let the cream cheese soften up enough. just stick it in the microwave for 15 second intervals until it's nice and soft andeverything should hold together fine. ^_^

LOVED these! delicious, everyone kept asking for the recipe. I highly recommend chilling the balls for at least an hour prior to dipping in the white chocolate, it's much easier that way.

These were delicious. My mother couldn't believe there were so few ingredients. They were a little difficult to dip neatly, but I think that's more my skill level than anything else.

So very good. Made these for a cookie exchange and everyone loved them. I did a batch with regular Oreo's and one with Candy Cane Oreo's. For the candy cane ones, I used a package and a half (due to the smaller pkg) and sprinkled crushed candy canes on top.

Okay some of you are complaining that these are too rich and sweet. Do what I did! Before processing the Oreo cookies, scrape all the white frosting in the middle off, and just grind the black part of the Oreo cookie. This is kind of tedious and long, but worth it if you find them too sweet. Everything else remains the same, and believe me they are delicious this way! Good Luck!

Very easy and tasty.  And rich.  Tastes even better the next day when the cream cheese blends with the cookie flavor.  Used a food processor to pulverize the cookies and then mix in the softened cream cheese.  VERY quick and easy.  I dipped in white candy coating then drizzled with red and blue candy coating for the 4th of July weekend.  Chilling the mixture makes it easy to scoop up in a melon baller and roll between the hands.  Chilled the balls before dipping in coating, then refrigerated the balls to set the coating.  Very pretty to look at.

They tasted better than I thought they would when I was making them.  They taste very good but much too sweet for me.  I also did not read the notes with tips on dipping the coating and it was a mess.  Fun to try but I do not think I would make them again.

These are amazing. I first started making them when I was getting Kraft's promotional cooking magazine. Not all that difficult to make and extremely addictive. Whenever I make them, there's no leftovers and if I've shared with friends, they always ask for the recipe.

Great, never fail recipe. There are NEVER leftovers of these. I have always made them with chocolate almond bark, with a drizzle of the white chocolate to make them prettier! I like to make the balls small enough to serve in the little silver or paper cups (like mini cupcake cups).

My whole family makes these over the holidays using both the white bark and the chocolate bark.  

Tips:  
1.  If you have a fondue warming pot it will make the bark stay warm and dippable.
2.  Try the recipe with the different holiday flavors of Oreo's.  My family likes the peanut butter filled and the mint filled.  YUM!!!!

This is FAB...easy easy...good.
Then I tried peanut butter cookies, 4 oz. cream cheese and 1/4 cup peanut butter. With chocolate coating...again great. Dipping can be hard so, put 4 or 5 chocolate chips in a mini muffin tin lined with paper liners, melt in oven on warm, put in balls, freeze for about 1/2 hour, melt more chips, drizzle over balls to coat. Let set til firm. As of yet planning to try different coatings and the kind of cookies.Maybe strawberry and chocolate coating then drizzle with white chocolate ...yummy... the ideas are endless. Thanks.

This recipe got thumbs up from everyone who tasted it. The hardest part is knowing when the cream cheese has been well incorporated into the cookie crumbs. But if you mix thoroughly enough, you get a stiff dough that does not crumble apart at all. I crushed the cookies by hand (in a ziploc freezer bag with a rolling pin) and  used my KitchenAid mixer to combine the crumbs and cream cheese. I used "white" chips, the store was out of almond bark. I think that made coating the balls more difficult because the chips didn't melt to as thin a mixture as the almond bark would have so it was difficult to dip the balls neatly. I topped each coated ball with chocolate sprinkles and they looked really nice.

I'm calling mine 'Inside-Out Oreos' for the chocolate cookie center and creamy white coating.  They're so easy and so good!  I refrigerated the balls before dipping them after reading other reviews which worked really well.  When they were coated, I refrigerated them to harden, put them in a bag and popped them in the freezer.  They're going on my Christmas cookie tray if I can just keep my hands off them!  Love it!

This recipe was good but I altered it by adding 1/c of melted chocolate to the mixture and let it cool so that it would be easier to work with.  I then used a melon baller to make the balls and dipped the balls in chocolate rather than vanilla candy coating as suggested.  They are more like truffles than cookies but they are very good and rich.  Let the chocolate covered balls rest on a cooling rack so that they won't form a chocolate "heel".

I didn't care for this recipe much, but I made it for a bake sale at work, and everyone else loved them.  The cookie mixture was sticky, and I had to keep them refrigerated, so the texture wasn't so mushy.

I used Chocolate Oreos with the Peanut Butter Creme. I used 4 oz of Cream cheese and about the same amount of peanut butter. I dipped it in melted Ghirardelli milk chocolate! Delightful.

My 12 yr old made these for a treat exchange. Super easy and delicious. She won the best looking cookie contest! Definitely use a blender/processor to crush the cookies and pop in the freezer for 15 minutes to get hard enough to dip. Use a dipping fork so they don't fall apart. They came out looking like a display at a candy shop.

They were good, not grand. I guess I expected spectacular with all the reviews also the three ingredients fool you because this is still time consuming because these have to be chilled at each stage. I made these to go in cookie tins for coworkers.

These were a big hit!  People were surprised when I told them that the center was nothing more than cream cheese and oreo cookies!  The fact that they are no bake is an extra bonus!  They are better the next day and the center reminds me of a really rich brownie.  I used a melon baller to scoop out the oreo mixture so that they were all the same size.  Will make again!

Well I couldn't get the chocolate to melt right so we just ate them w/out the coating.  And i only used 1/2 the cream cheese.  They reminded me good humor ice cream sandwiches, I thought they were wonderful. I would like to coat them so I'll have to work on that!

Great basic recipe! Thanks for sharing Annette! Endless variations on this! Love the p-nut butter idea. I like to add a little over 1/2 of a 6oz bag of p-nut butter chips to the almond bark before melting. I also like a refreshing taste of lemon cream cookies, white almond bark, white chocolate baking chips. Add about a teaspoon of lemon  flavoring to the cookie truffle part and to the melted bark. I love making this type of cookie truffle with different flavor combinations, and decorating them. I like placing them in candy papers and filling cookie tins to give as gifts also.

SO YUMMY!  I've made these twice now and both times I've gotten rave reviews.  The first time I made them I shaped them into footballs, dipped them in chocolate almond bark, and then drew lines on them using white chocolate almond bark.  They were a huge hit with the guys for Superbowl weekend.  The 2nd time I made them was for Hubby for Valentine's Day.  I shaped them into kisses then dipped them into chocolate almond bark.  Once hardened, I wrapped them with aluminum foil and stuck a tag in the top.  Turned out really cute and tasted so good, too!  Am waiting anxiously to find another great excuse to make them.  ;)

Everyone always loves these little balls of deliciousness! I mix the oreo/cream cheese mixture in a food processor, which makes it very easy. By the way, use 1/3 less fat cream cheese, no one can tell the difference & it makes these a teensy bit less sinful! I also chill or freeze before attempting the almond bark dip into the double boiler. However, I just am not very good at the dipping process. That is by far the most difficult part of this recipe. So, to diguise their ugliness I fling some melted chocolate around with a fork for an "accent". After that you can't even tell that I have no dipping skills.

I decided to make these at the last minute, I'm from Alberta so some of the ingredients were altered/changed somehow  My version #1)we never used the food processor b/c my baking slave thought it would make cookies too fine so she tried half abag of Oreo cookies & just smashed them separately in a heavy bag w/a heavy pot till we thought they would be right size,we used the whole bag. #2)the cream cheese was softened in a kitchen-aide blender #3)we added half a bag of c/crumbs but the mixture still seemed too moist so the rest of c/crumbs were added #4)the cookie/mix  was dipped in a white/choc gnosh (all were melted in microwave)took about 3bags of white cc plus some were rolled in icing sugar.they looked nice & the whole recipe was SINFULLY-GREAT! the 'balls' could of been chilled b/f dipping b/c we got some odd colored balls, this recipe was quick,messy hands after rolled but the dog liked to lick your hands clean!!!  I think we got about 60 balls..? depending how big U rolled them, we just used a TB & hoped for the best!!   Thank You for this recipe!

I tried these back at Christmas time. They are to die for and easy to make.  A food Processor works well to break the cookies up.  My sister-in-law tried a blender and that DID NOT work.  You can only put like 3 in at a time.  I made this recipe with a chocolate coating and a vanilla swirl on top for decoration.

Oh my gosh... these are AWESOME!! Who knew that just 3 common ingredients and a few simple steps could make such a wonderful little treat! Once I mixed the cookies and cream cheese (at room temp) together, I made them into balls and froze them for about 30 minutes. That way the chocolate easily coated and the balls weren't sticky or falling apart. I would love to try this recipe using different cookie combos.

These are the best!!! And only 3 ingredients - how great is that?! I found it easier to let the dough chill for a couple hours before dipping it into the melted almond bark. I then dropped them into tiny foil muffin cups and sprinkled them with a variety of things - chocolate sprinkles, colored sprinkles, red and green sugar, and nonpareils. These looked great on my Christmas cookie plate and everyone wanted the recipe!

I first had these at a family Christmas party and everyone just gobbled them up, especially the men, lol.. but we make them with Chocolate Almond Bark for the coating, not white. So good! They just melt in your mouth, I don't think I would make them with white knowing how good they are with the chocolate coating! Give it try, especially if you didn't like it as much this way. It is important to put the balls in the freezer for a bit first though before coating with the chocolate and crush in the blender or food processor.

I started making cake balls a while ago. I liked especially with this recipe – cream cheese instead of massive cake frosting – THEN cookies over baking a cake – SO MUCH EASIER. I took the cream filling out of half – just to cut down on the sugar, and added a little Hershey’s cocoa powder just to bump up chocolate. I added Kahlua to those for adults! These were great fun. The white coating I used half of the candy coating with half Ghirardelli white chocolate . . . rich and so good, but the big pay pack with these balls over so many other balls – EASY and fast.

Very yummy and extremely easy! These were great to make, since I didn't have to bake anything!  Put cookies and low fat cream cheese(Neufchâtel cheese) in food processor. Would be great for birthday parties, BBQ's, work functions, or just because.  :) I used vanilla and chocolate almond bark to coat them.  Sprinkles on top covered any uneven coating.   These would be great on a stick, like cake pops but easier- no baking!  DO STICK IN FREEZER FOR 10-15 minutes for easy handling and the almond bark sets up very quickly, this way.

I guess I did something wrong when making these.  The cookie/cream cheese middle was soft and mushy after I dipped them and let the almond bark harden. The cookie middle tasted like a wet oreo cookie.

Also my white almond bark must have been heated too hot. I put it in a pot on the lowest heat possible and stirred frequently but it scorched, turning brown.  It tasted ok and I still used it but I didn't have the pretty white cookie balls like everyone else had in their photos.

As attractive as these cookies look, I don't think I will make this recipe again until I find out what my failure was.  The mushy cookie middles were not good.

Used my fav bought cookie. Presidents Choice Decadent Chocolate Chip , they crush easily in a lg bowl with a heavy bottom glass and soften the cream cheese via microwave so the cookie crumbs are more easily absorbed to create an awsome truffle !

I'm rating this a 5 because everyone LOVED them and begged for the recipe.  I thought they were very sweet and rich.  I took all reviewers advice and they were all helpful.  Main thing is to keep the "dough" cold.  I worked in batches and once it started to warm up, I put it back in the fridge for 20 minutes.  Also, when dipping the balls in chocolate, my melted chocolate because filled with little pieces of cookie but it worked great. I turned mine into eyeballs for Halloween but will make again for the holidays using broken pieces of candy cane or something festive.  Thank you!!

I made these today and, while they taste good, they are terrible to work with. The ball falls apart when dipping in melted chocolate. I'm not the only one with this problem. Someone suggested using half the cream cheese. That might be the answer.

These were super easy to make and everyone loved them.  They actually would have been even easier to make if I wasn't at school and I actually had a blender, but that just shows the versatility of this recipe.  I made these twice in one week, using white chocolate chips for the coating the second time because I couldn't find anymore almond bark/candy coating at the store.  Easy, relatively inexpensive, pretty-looking crowd favorite...make these!

These are good, but I am giving 4 stars because they weren't as heavenly as everyone says, and they are kind of a pain to make. Maybe a different flavor combo would be better (I used chocolate with chocolate).

Threw it all in the food processor, rolled into balls and froze overnight, covered in melted white chocolate. I keep them in the freezer and eat them frozen when I need a little treat. Like cookies & cream truffles!

Tasty, but a gigantic mess and not worth the hassle.  My dough was very sticky even after refrigerating, and immediately melted when dipped in the coating.  The result was not attractive!

I dipped mine in white chocolate and decorated them like eyeballs for Halloween!  Great recipe, easy to make.  Be sure to crush the cookies by hand not food processer...I've done that before and they weren't firm enough to make into balls.

I already knew these would taste good.. but they were so simple too. I crushed the cookies in a blender, melted the cream cheese. I placed the mix in the freezer for 20 min so it would be easier to mold. Once i molded them i placed them back in for another 20 min so they would stay in place while i dipped them. Worked for me:)

So my FSIL isn't into sweets at all. He will eat oreos and milk ever now and then. I made these for easter baskets and he went crazy!!! I have made them twice for him so far and he doesn't know it but his grooms cake is going to be a three tiered cookie ball cake..can't wait:) Thank you for this recipe!

Simple, but they certainly take a long time... They don't sell almond bark where I live so I just melted white chocolate and dipped them in that, drizzling melted semi-sweet chocolate over them to make them pretty. Oh, also, I thought they looked nice when they were only half-dipped, so I left them like that, but I wouldn't recommend doing that, since the balls -- even after you freeze them -- can easily revert back to the gooey substance they were before being dipped. Speaking of which, I followed everyone else's advice and refrigerated the dough before rolling them into balls (for 20 minutes) and then froze the balls for an hour before dipping. After dipping, I froze them for another 20 minutes because the warm white chocolate had supposedly caused them to go soft, and only after that did I put the finishing touches on them. They taste pretty good, but I didn't love them... Odd, since I used to really love Oreos (those are the sandwich cookies I used). Not bad, I guess. I'll see how everyone at school likes them on Monday.

These were good and very easy. However the only flavor I could taste was oreo, perhaps more cream cheese would have made it a more exciting dessert. Also I recommend freezing the dough for about 20 minutes or else the chocolate balls will fall apart while dipping in warm chocolate!

Captivating, as you turn those crumbs into mud!  I wasn't as into the flavor, but they got rave reviews from anyone who had them.  It was a solid mess trying to roll those balls in the candy coating, i haven't figured a good system for that yet.

SOOOO Good!  I made these for Valentine's Day for my kids teachers.  I used pink, white and red sprinkles and boy were they cute.  I used Double Stuff oreos and light cream cheese.  I used a small cookie scoop to make the balls the same size.  I also put them in the freezer for 1/2 hour before dipping.  I will make again and again.

These were surprisingly easy, especially if you use a food processor and mixer.  They taste great and I would make them again.  Also if you need to warm up the cream cheese heat it in the oven for 10 min at 200 degrees.

Very easy and very good.  I used chocolate for the coating since I didn't have candy coating.  They still were good.  I had to do a few batches of crushed cookies and cream cheese in the food processor bc mine is small, but it worked well enough.   I used my small cookie scoop to make the balls and froze the trays for about an hour.  They set up perfectly and were relatively easy to cover in chocolate, although I'll admit that is not my expertise.  Thanks for the recipe.

I had my 9yr old litte cook help me with this on Sunday 10/19. I gave her the recipe and ingredients but the white chocolate was microwaved too long.  So I went to her house to try to solve the problem and read the almond bark pkg. and found out I needed shortening.  I took everything home and finished it by melting white chocolate and about tbsp shortening and coated them by using two teaspoons stead of a fork and sprinkled them. They are good.

I was looking for a fun recipe that my daughter and I could make together and this was perfect!  We had no trouble coating them at all.  We used chocolate coating instead of white (personal preference) and just used a spoon to dip them and transfer to a wax paper covered cookie sheet.  They were a big hit!

My mom and I make these every few months and keep them in the freezer.  When we get the urge for chocolate yummies we get one out. We do use the blender for the cookies.  We also used mint chocolate chips once and they were good.

mmm...my roommate made these for me twice - once with chocolate Oreos and chocolate coating and once with Oreos that were white on the outside with chocolate cream and vanilla almond bard coating...I like the white ones the best but both were delicious.  They never lasted long - we had girls from the floor below running up to get some!

This couldn't be simpler to make but the taste is awesome!  A big hit on the cookie trays this year.  I ran out of white chocolate chips and had to use milk chocolate to finish up the last dozen or so & they weren't as good in my opinion (way too rich), so stick with the white chocolate as the recipe suggests. Can't go wrong with this treat!

I made these to take to the hospital one day for all my nurses and they loved them.  Leftovers were given to my study group as we studied for finals and they all wanted the recipe.  They are very good but next time I will make them much much smaller.  Also, refrigerating the balls makes them easier to dip.

I made this recipe to put in my gift tins this Christmas. Everyone loved them. They looked pretty too. I didn't coat them all the way so you could still see the oreo color then I sprinkled them w/ red and green sugar.

So good and so easy!  Most difficult part was putting the white candy/chocolate coating on. I only covered the tops of the cookie ball rather than trying to dip the entire ball into the white chocolate. I took another reviewer's advice about placing them into the mini cupcake paper cups.  Sprinkled them with some candy for my daughter's first birthday party before the white chocolate set and then put them into the fridge for the white chocolate to harden. Delicious little bit sizes treats!

When I made these everyone could tell immediately that it was crushed oreos (they are rather distinctive). I made these mainly as an easy extra to several other holiday cookies, only the small kids actually liked them.

These were a great desert on my holiday desert tray.  Made exactly as directions stated.  Different sort of consistency as they aren't a true truffle, but certainly the consistency reminds you of one.  Will make again and experiment with different flavors.

I found it nearly impossible to dip them in chocolate so I opted to roll them in powdered sugar which worked out better.

These are a classic!  Simple ingredients that can be adapted to any flavor profile.  I followed the suggestions to refrigerate them overnight before dipping.  A cookie scoop helps me portion them out, and plastic forks with the two middle tines snapped off make for a great dipping tools. (I have also heard that you could save the egg dipper from the Easter egg dye kits for dipping too.) I recently baked a tube of refrigerated cinnamon rolls and pulsed them in the food processor in place of the cookie crumbs.  The frosting packet that came with the rolls was added along with the cream cheese, and then they were dipped in white chocolate.  There are so many great ways to enjoy this recipe!

I made this with my mom's help (I went to her house and she watched the baby while I made these) this past saturday.  Super easy.  I didnt break out my mom's food processor, but with a rolling pin and a ziplock bag, I didnt need one.  One suggestion though if you're crushing the cookies by hand, scrape off the cream filling and sit it aside.  I did do this the first time around and what a mess inside the ziplock bag did it make.  Second time, I scraped the cream filling off each cookie.  After my cookies were crushed, I added the filling AND the cream cheese to the crumbs.  Then just mixed everything together by hand.  Easy Peasy!  The bark I used came in its own tray to melt it in the microwave.  Had just enough melted bark leftover to cover some pretzels with!  These were so tasty, I had to take the container away from my mom, or else she would have made off with an entire batch!  They are that Tasty!  :D  Saving this in my holiday treat file!

Oh this was a bad idea....so far it's been pretty hard to stay out of these.  I used generic oreos, the full cube of cream cheese and almond bark.  I did chill the balls before dipping, and while that likely made it easier, I don't really think I have much talent when it comes to dipping.  But it didn't matter, they turned out amazing.  definitnely not as 'pretty' as they could have, but still delish.

Yum! What a simple but delicious recipe. Like others, I often have trouble when I have to dip anything in melted chocolate. I tried something  a little different this time and it seemed to work. I melted the chocolate in the microwave and then transferred it to a double boiler to keep it warm. The key is to keep the heat low. If you make these for a party, you are guaranteed to have no leftovers! And if you like this recipe, you should make cake balls. So good!

These are so sinful! I didn't change a thing, but I drizzled some dark chocolate over the top by melting some semi-sweet choco chips in the microwave, putting them in a plastic bag, snipping a very small hole in the corner to drizzle. They were pretty and delicious!

This recipe saved me! I make it all the time because it's so easy and everyone loves them... BUT I have no idea where to find candy coating where I live so I coat them in chocolate. I don't add wax or anything, just melt in a double boiler and dip. So easy! And if they look messy (sometimes I rush) I just sprinkle icing sugar on top after they dry. Also, I often make the balls before hand, freeze them or put them in the fridge until I'm ready to finish... sometimes even over night. I tell you, this is a very flexible and yummy recipe!

Maybe I did something wrong, but this was messy to make and I found them too rich.  My kids liked them anyways though.  Perhaps I'll try again someday and put less cream cheese.

These are delicious and I always get asked for the recipe when I make them. I add vanilla to the cookies/cream cheese and I coat with white chocolate chips. Yum! :)

EASY! And I used vanilla cookies instead of chocolate and they were just as yummy. Definitely pop the balls in the freezer for about 30 minutes to make them easier to handle when dunking in the warm chocolate coating. And if you are making these as a gift, save a box from assorted chocolates or use a shirt box with some bright tissue paper to display the treats as boxed chocolates.

These are always a hit for any occasion. I have been making these for Christmas for several years and everyone looks forward to getting them! I, like other reviewers, recommend refrigerating the balls before coating so they are firm for dipping. I use a toothpick to dip and then cover the hole with a decorative star in chocolate candy coating. They come out perfectly shaped and decorated. If you store in the fridge let them set to room temperature before serving. They will melt in your mouth!

My boyfriend's favorite, and so easy.  I like to use the wilton candy melts that Michael's sells, it comes in different colors and flavors, and is a lot smoother than melted chocolate.

I have never rated a recipe before, but these definitely deserve 10 stars!  Oh my gosh...I never thought these would be as big of a hit as they were! Now for every party I go to people ask me to bring these cookie balls.  I also made peanut butter ones too that went over just as well with the crowd!  All I did was use half cream cheese and half peanut butter and then dipped them in chocolate almond bark. But the key is to roll them into balls then put them in the fridge for about 30 min then dip them...much easier and less messy!  Thank you for this awesome recipe!

Another way to present these treats is to use lollipop sticks. Dip a lollipop stick in melted chocolate and insert into the balls. Let chill about 15 mins in freezer to set stick. Then dip balls in chocolate and decorate. Let dry by inserting pops into a big piece of styrofoam. Be sure NOT to let the balls freeze before coating them or else they will crack while drying. Kids LOVE these!!!

These are good but not great.  The cream cheese taste was too strong for me after all was said and done.  I would have rather eaten the cookies with a glass of milk. UPDATE: I tried the mint cookie with chocolate bark and it was WAY better! Moved up from 3 to 5 stars!

AWESOME!!! I made white Sandwich cookies with non-dairy Tofuti cream cheese. I placed both of those in my food processor to combine. Then I refrigerated the mixture for a few hours, made them into balls and froze them in a single layer. Then I gave them a quick bath in parve white chocolate and added some sprinkles on the top. They were a huge hit!

I ended up using a rolling pin and a gallon storage bag to crush them.  I think if I would have frozen the cookies before putting them in the blender if would have worked but mine just ended up stuck to the bottom of the blender.  After forming them into balls I put them in the freezer for 10-15 minutes and they turned out great!  Even had a few moms ask for the recipe at our easter play group party;)

These are so good.  They are very hard to quit eatting.  My favorite variation is using mint oreos and chocolate almond bark.  I always let my dough sit in the fridge an hour or so to let the flavors combine.

DO NOT USE OVERSTUFFED OREOS! I made two batches of these, one with regular Oreos and one with Overstuffed Oreos (the grocery store I went to only had one box of regular left). I made the first batch using the Overstuffed Oreos. I followed the recipe's directions exactly, but found when I got to the step of forming the balls, they wouldn't keep their shape. So I actually ended up having to put them in globs on wax paper and freeze them. Meanwhile, I tried the regular Oreos hoping for some better results. No problem with that batch. So save yourself a headache and buy the normal Oreos. 'Nough said. Thanks for a yummy recipe. They are a bit too sweet for me to have more than one (not to mention the calories!), but they were a hit for my husband's work crew.

These were a big valentines day hit. The kids loved helping roll the balls out. Next time I make them I will make the balls a little smaller so I can enjoy more of the candy coating :). I couldn't help but feel weird about the center bc they were left out & part of me thinks they should be refrigerated bc of the cream cheese. No one got sick though. Thank you for the yummy recipe... I WILL be making them again.

Oh my, decadent and delicious!  Did find that chilling the mixture before dunking in melted bark worked real well.  Reserved a bit of the crunched up cookies to use as garnish.  Yummy yummy!

I have made these a lot and they are usually a hit.  I have used the golden oreos, cut back a tablespoon on the cream cheese, added key lime juice and lime zest.  Those were loved too.  For a tip on dipping, I put mine into the freezer for a little while and then dip.  The other tip is to put canola oil into your almond bark until it is smooth and thinned out some.  It keeps the bark from clumping.

I'm not a big fan of Oreos, one is usually enough for me, so I didn't expect much when my daughter made these. Wow, was I shocked! Mixing the oreos with the cream cheese cuts down on the over sweetness and makes them delicious.

My family preferred to eat the cookie ball without the white chocolate coating.  I'll try again with nutter butter and regular chocolate coating.  I used the micowaveable dipping chocolate with a baby spoon and baby fork.  Very easy.  I chilled balls in freezer for one hour before dipping.  Great project for little helpers.

Pretty little bonbons that look so fancy and are so simple. I used the holiday edition oreos which have green frosting. Make sure to refrigerate the balls before dipping them, probably at least an hour. I dipped them in vanilla almond bark and then sprinkled red and clear sugar sprinkles on top and they were a very cute addition to the holiday cookie plate.

I made two versions of this today - one as is and one with peanut butter sandwich cookies dipped in semisweet chocolate. Both are very good. Just sub 1 lb peanut butter sandwich cookies (Nutter Butters) and use 1 lb semisweet chocolate chips to dip them in.

Great, quick recipe to whip up for a party!  I made these this morning for a halloween party tonight, and I ate a few and had to stop myself!  I know they'll be a big hit.....I sprinkled crushed cookie crumbs over the top after dipping like in the picture...they look perfect!!

These are good but it is hard to get them to look neat. The dipping process is very difficult. Mine came out with too much chocolate in some areas and it was just overpowering and so sweet.   On another website these are called Oreo Truffles. They suggest that you add about 2oz of parafin wax to the chocolate to make it look more smooth when you dip it. I will try that today.

My friend introduced me to these yummy little delights last Christmas and I fell in love.  I like to use mint oreos when I make them.  They always turn out many compliments and requests for more!

These are so yummy. I followed a reviewers advice and after freezing the dough a bit, I dipped them half way and put them back in fridge to set up...then I held the base and dipped the other half. I also used a ziplock bag with a tiny hold to drizzle delicate milk choc. on top. My bf could not believe they were not store bought...I wish I had taken a pic because they looked so perfect, but they were gobbled up way too fast.

These were fantastic! I made them very small so that my guests could just pop one in there mouth! Tehy were a hit! I had at least 4 people ask for the recipe!! I used my blender to grind the oreos where they were like powder! Thats the secret-no chunks!

I got a ton of compliments on these, except everyone wanted to eat them (and they're not exactly a light food!). I had fun putting them in the bottom of a small sundae for the kids and they had a great surprise when they found it there. Can't go wrong with these tasty ingredients.

This was very easy and turned out great! My blender didn't crush the cookies well (obliterated a few then spun the blades without chopping any more). Instead, I put the cookies in a big ziploc bag and used the flat side of my meat tenderizer to pound them until they were all crushed. I ended up mixing the cookies/softened cream cheese by squishing it all together with my hands. I found that to be much easier and more efficient than a spoon. I also used semi-sweet chocolate morsels, melting them via the instructions on the bag, and rolling the chilled cookie balls around in the bowl of melted chocolate with a couple of soup spoons. They turned out wonderful, my mom wants to make them for the whole family for Easter!

I only give it four because this isn't the version I prefer.  I always use oreos and often mint oreos.  Also it is better with semi-sweet bakers chocolate.  I've been making these for years. Last in the freezer wonderfully.

My friend gave me this recipe years ago except it just called for chocolate chips melted in the microwave.  My daughter made them for a cookie contest in Girl Scouts and won for her troup and district and took second in regionals!  She was young at the time and could make this recipe all by herself with minimal help from mom. :)  We did melt white choc chips too and drizzled across the milk choc for appearance.  They are delicious!!!

I have been making these for years but i also call them "Oreo Truffles". This recipe can have many variations. I have made them with all different kinds of oreos, but my favorite ones are mint oreos. I sometimes will also mold the bals around junior mints.  I always freeze these for about 30 min before I dip them and I usually divide them and take half out at a time to dip. I find if you take them all out at once they start to soften and it become really hard to dip them. You can slo try diffent type of chocolates to dip them in, not just almond bark.

One of the best treats out there.  I usually just make them for Christmas, because it's not really something you want to get into on a regular basis...but oh so good!  Last time I made them was during a massive baking day, and I assigned these to my boyfriend.  He did a great job and was definitely a fan of the finished product!  (Of course, I'm not sure how you couldn't be!)  We chilled the "dough" before making balls too, and it made everything very easy.

These tasted ok but were very hard to roll and dip.  They kept falling off the toothpick even after time in the freezer.  Not worth the effort.

I've made these the past couple of years and everyone loves them.  They are very rich, though.  I've called them Oreo Truffles; I like the name Cookies and Cream Truffles. I have used the chocolate cream oreos as well as regular and even reduced fat oreos.  They are all good!  I usually chill the dough like others, melt the almond bark in my electric fondue pot to keep it easy to coat the balls, and then sprinkle with colored sugar or drizzle melted chocolate over them.  They look and taste like you've slaved, but are very quick and easy to make!  This recipe and Tiger Butter are my two Christmas staples because, as a mother of 3 children, I need to make large quanities or good things quickly for teachers and friends.

Made these a few days ago and they are great.  I made according to recipe and then I decided to try them using a peanut butter filled cookie, (like an Oreo, but it's peanut butter instead of chocolate) added a half a cup of peanut butter to the cream cheese and covered them with dark chocolate almond bark instead of white almond bark. They were 
a little harder to make into balls than the Oreo cookies, but they tasted great.  I stuck a toothpick in them to roll them into the melted chocolate.  It is a little difficult to make them look nice.  I stored them in a plastic container in the freezer and just take some out as you need them.

WOW was this a great recipe! Very simple to make yet tastes like it took hours to prepare (I did take the advice of a previous poster and chilled the dough prior to rolling)... I took this to an office picnic and people were stumbling all over themselves to get another piece. I had more requests for a copy of this recipe than for any other dish I've made.

What a great recipe! I made the "dough" the night before and let it sit in the refrigerator. The next morning I rolled it into balls and dipped in the candy coating. My style of "dipping" was dropping the whole ball into the melted coating and then scooping it out with a spoon. The only thing that I would do different would allow put the "dough" back into the refrigerator for some time after I rolled it into balls. Everyone loved them! I had leftover candy coating, so I dipped pretzels into it. Delicious!

This is really an impressive recipe considering the ingredients!  They are more of a truffle than a cookie but really good and rich--I made some as called for with oreos and white bark, and another batch with peanut butter sandwich cookies and peanut butter chips--just as good!!  Be sure to chill before dipping and WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT PUT THEM ON A WIRE RACK TO AVOID A HEEL AS THEY WILL STICK TO IT AFTER COOLING!!!!

Careful!  You need chocolate candy coating to dip in, not vanilla-flavored, if you want them to look like footballs.  Hard to dip and get just the right amount of coating so it isn't dripping off.

This recipe was so simple and fantastic.  Made the footballs for Superbowl, and made the circular ones just 2 days later and decorated them in substitution for a neighbors birthday cake. When I walked in, his kids were so excited there were more of the same type of cookies from Superbowl.  I will make again and again.  I had to use chocolate and chocolate Oreos, and it made it just like a chocolate truffle.  I think varying up the type of Oreos will be fun.  Maybe the minty ones for St. Patty's day.

I love this recipe!  It was very easy and very delicious and delectable.  The only thing I would say though is that using a table-spoon sized yield like the video says got me a little less than the 36 cookies, but came close...I got 30 and I didn't eat any before they were done, I promise!  So, if you have to have 36 yield like the original recipe says, I would suggest just making them a little smaller than a tablespoon size but other than that, a fabulous recipe that I'll probably bring to my holiday parties this year.

Everyone loved these for the gathering I took them to. (I personally liked them also, but one is my limit on account of how very rich they are) My husband and kids made sure I left some at home so they could have more. I followed the recipie and did a batch in milk chocolate also using the extra chocolate to drizzle on top of the opposite for presentation. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved these, but I did kick it up a notch. Instead of the coating suggested, I melted marshmellows, rolled the cookie balls in it and tossed them in crushed graham crackers. A-MAZ-ING! Huge rave reviews from my coworkers when I whipped these up for our company potluck.

I made these cookies for christmas, I changed it up a tad. I used Mint oreos and melted mint chocolate chips for the coating. Everyone loved them! I also made the traditional with the regular oreos and candy coating, hmmm not as good as the mint! The Candy coating makes the cookie to hard to just bite into. But i will make the mint style again! I put the oreos in my food processor and that worked perfect then cubed up the cream cheese and mixed in with a rubber spatula.

I gave these five stars because they are simple to make, and were the hit of the christmas party. The dipping part was a little messy, but it was worth it.

Ok if I can do this, anyone can! I made it according to directions. I was confused by comments that recommended not using the whole bar of cream cheese because without that, I couldn't get the dough consistentcy needed. I also did not even taste the cream cheese, so perhaps they were using a different type of cream cheese. The possibilities are endless with this recipe! Hmm what about nutter butter cookies with strawberry cream cheese? PB & J cookies? These taste fantastic and will be my new go to recipes. FYI I found using a small spoon much easier than the fork to roll the balls around in the chocolate. Also I used almond bark as other suggested, YUM!!!

Delish! I think everything has been said already about this cookie/candy and how to make it. So I only want to add that peppermint bark would be a wonderful coating, especially for the holidays. You can also get the most wonderful peppermint Joe's O's at Trader Joes, although they are seasonal. They also have vanilla, chocolate chocolate and ginger which are divine, a more grown up taste.

these are really delicious! they're very moist and tasty. only thing was, that i didn't need 1 whole pound of vanilla flavored candy coating. it was WAY too much. i ended up dipped all sort of things around my kitchen (pretzels, marshmallow....not bad, actually) and making almond bark, as well. also, i recommend thawing the cookie balls (if taking them straight out of the fridge) for a few minutes. moistens the inside and make the candy coating a little easier to eat. i really enjoyed these cookie balls, and my family loved them. i will definetly make these again :)

This is one of my favorite chocolate recipes! It is yummy, rich and lasts for a while (unless you like to eat like me). The only thing I changed was when dipping. I bought and used white melted chocolate chips instead. The melted chips hardened after sitting for maybe 2-3 mins. because you have to be quick. When that happened, I just reheated the mixture. I saw a few reviews that said the same thing. Over all, this is a GREAT recipe that I would share with the younger ones and the adults love them just as much, too!!(:

These work great with variation of Nutter Butter cream cheese, and almond bark, can melt peanut butter chips to drizzle on top for presentation. FOR Halloween can put gummy lifesavers on top with mini choc chips in the middle to make them look like eyballs! Very fun.

Very very good.  I used chocolate coating instead of vanilla, as I figured that would be overly sweet.  They are still incredible sweet, but not as much as vanilla would have been.

I made these because I got the urge to bake stuff, however we don't have central air, only a window unit, so anything in the oven heats up the house way too much. With that in mind, these not only did not require baking, but also looked delicious and easy! I did as reviewers suggested and let the cookie crumble mix refrigerate to make it easier to roll into balls. Then I dipped it in the chocolate, and with the remaining chocolate, I colored it with some cocoa until it was a nice brown color and drizzled it across the cookie balls. I brought them to work the next day and everyone said they were amazing!

I found these to be really hard to make.  When I dipped them in the melted chocolate the cake ball picked up way too much chocolate.  In the end after dipped a few, I gave up and just sprinkled them with powdered sugar and they turned out pretty good.

I made these for Easter.  They were a hit, especially with the younger crowd.  Amazingly, you still get the full taste of an Oreo cookie and in my opinion you don't taste the cream cheese.  Will make again!

I made these but as a whole slice. So it was base oreo mixture and cream cheese covered with the white chocolate...Also added hundreds and thousands to the top...Put biscuit base in freezer for an hour before adding the melted white chocolate...Let's just say people were hiding it at work it was so good!

These are very, very good, but very, very sweet! I dipped them in milk chocolate chips instead of vanilla flavored coating--what is that stuff anyway?! :-P I mixed the "dough" and chilled it for a bit. Then rolled into balls and placed the balls on a wax paper lined cookie sheet. I put the cookie sheet into the freezer for about half an hour, then melted my chocolate chips and dipped the balls. Kind of labor intensive, but worth it in the end.

Easy and delicious! The second batch that I made I used lemon cookies and added a bit of grated lemon peel for some zest. Yum, yum! Some other cookies that are good are Grasshopper cookies (chocolate mint cookies), gingerbread cookies, or even chocolate chip cookies. If you use shortbread cookies or a plain vanilla cookie you can add some raspberry jam to the mixture for a more elegant cookie ball. Another good idea with vanilla cookies is to add peanut butter  and chopped nuts as well. Endless possibilities!

Very easy to make but VERY sweet.  Couldn't find almond bark to save my life so melted milk chocolate down and dipped away.

I made them for my office party and they were a big hit. Plus it was fun making them with my husband. We mixed the oreos in a plastic bag with the cream cheese it was much easier.

Very good.  I halved the recipe (it's just two of us) and used light cream cheese.  I didn't chill before dipping, so these didn't look picture perfect, but that was ok with me since I just made these for us.  I'd like to try these again with the different flavored oreos or Nutter Butters as other reviewers suggested.

Outstanding cookie balls!  I made some changes to the candy coating. I ground 2 tbsp of high end coffee beans and mixed that into melted bitter sweet chocolate.  I also used a 1 tbsp dough scoop to the truffle filling and then froze the fillings before coating with chocolate. With the left over chocolate I drizzled over each truffle ball..  I am Queen when I make these!!  thank you Thank You thank you!

ok well where to begin... as for the taste it`s delicious! I blended the cream cheese and cookie crumbs in my food processor like most reviewers suggestioned. I then chilled the mixture for about 2 hours then rolled then into tiny balls and chilled them again. I didn`t have candy coating (I don`t even know what that is to be honest) so I used white chocolate for half of the batch and semi sweet chocolate for the other half... and what a diaster! My balls melted and made a mess. A real dissapointment. I had to work fast cause the oreo mixture got soft and mush. I was suppose to bring them to work but now I`ll have to make something else. Better luck to those who try this recipe.

After I coated the oreo balls with white choco chips, I heated up a handfull of milk choco chips, added a teas. of raspberry extract, and drizzled it over the balls.  For anyone who loves dark chocolate and raspberry, you will flip over this.

I make these for all the holidays.  I dip them in the white bark and then sprinkle them with the current holiday sprinkles or colored sugar.  The basketball and football team loves them, and requests them.

Have come across this recipe several times and finally decided to try!I used oreo cookies,1 tap vanilla and the cream cheese....Make sure to pulverize cookies to powder/crumb form.I micro'ed cheese 15 sec and make sure to mix thoroughly w/hands!I crushed a few mint candy canes and rolled the balls into..then rolled some in crushed gingerbread,and some into coconut...I ended up w/45 balls,and stored in freezer!!I didn't bother with melting chocolate...They were great as is!This is very easy!!!Do not pass this up!

Easy and delicious! I added 1/4 t vanilla and 1/2 t instant coffee, and it really gave it a little something extra. Probably could've added more, but my little nephew will be eating them, so I didn't want to load up on the caffeine. They were a little sweet for my husband, so next year I think I'll coat them in dark chocolate.

Amazing and make great Christmas treat gifts. I use a slotted spoon to hold the balls and another spoon to spoon over the melted chocolate. Be sure to add the sprinkles right away before the chocolate hardens. This is my sons job and he loves to help me. Best made the day before.

Really great! What I did was mix the cookies and cream cheese and place it in the fridge overnight. The next day I used a cookie scoop and made into balls. Let come to room temp. And then dipped in chocolate. Put back in the fridge just to harden. Looked beautiful and tasted great!

The name of the recipe doesn’t do it justice.  I loved these although they are a little messy to roll into balls, I will refrigerate for longer next time (only set them in the fridge for about 10 minutes) maybe that will help.  I also used white chocolate to dip them in.

THESE ARE THE BEST!!  I absolutely love these cookie balls.  I ended up calling them Oreo Truffles.  They were a hit at Thanksgiving!  I put my Oreos in a processor, and the fine cookie crumbs with the cream cheese made for a creamy, almost silky center.  I had lots of compliments.  Thanks for the recipe. =)

Delicious although I do a little diffently. 1. use double stuffed cookies 2. crush cookies in food processor and then drop in the softened cream cheese.  Process until just blended. 3. paint bon bon molds with chocolate and pipe mixture into them and then cover with more chocolate. I typically use dark chocolate wafers that you buy at Michael's or Joanns.

Great treat.  My daughters love to crush the cookies and form the balls. The finer they are crushed the better. Definitely chill the balls before dipping and chill them before eating. They don't last long, so make extra. I have even put a drop or two of peppermint extract into some of the dipping chocolate. Update: These are also great with white sandwich cookies and white chocolate.

I've been making these for a few years and they've been dubbed "Balls of Goodness" by my friends. I use different types of chocolate and toppings to add some visual variety to the platter. I keep them in the fridge until I send them to work or serve them at home. So Yummy!!

I love this recipe. It's simple, easy to make, and tastes great. I tried a variation of this recipe that works great. I substituted andes baking chips for the white candy coating. It gave the cookie balls a great mint taste. They were a big hit. I'll definitely try other variations in the future.

i used semi-sweet chocolate and added some fun sprinkles, these were really yummy, but a little difficult to cover in chocolate.  towards the end, i worked out my "two fork" technique, so i am hoping it is easier next time.  this is a great recipe and an easy way to use up the rest of the oreos that i didn't use in my cheesecake crust!

Good, but not exceptional. I probably won't do this again...but maybe if I have a lot of oreos on hand. There are just better things to do with an oreo...

Totally YUMMO!  Everyone at the office (and home) LOVED them!  Easy to make - followed the recipe exactly.  Can't wait to try other variations (Nutter Butter, Chips A'hoy, Vanilla Wafers, etc).

Tasty, but the vanilla coating was really too thick for easy dipping. I had to thin it with paraffin and milk.

I give it four stars only because it is so messy to make, My fingers got reall messy while rolling these in chocolate. Other than that, my kids loved these and they don't like cream cheese. I didn't have the white candy coating, so I used melted chocolate chips. Still tasted great. Will definately make again.

I roll these in melted candy making chocolate like Wilton brand. It comes in many colors.  I color coordinate with the holiday, such as red or green for Christmas. You can have so much fun at Easter... buy several pastel colors and make little easter baskets filled with them for friends! I even made some pink ones for a baby shower!  Let your imagination have fun!

These are absolutly wonderful. I made them for my husband on valentines day and he couldn't get enough.  I followed the recipe exactly. I put in the fridge over night and dipped in white choco the following day. I am actually thinking of making these for our ceremony, maybe put into "wedding molds" and then coat.  Will make again and again

Bad name for a great recipe.  I made these for my mother-in-law who is going thru chemo treatments, she loves oreos, they were a huge hit.  I also made some using nutter butter cookies, dipped in milk chocolate.  great recipe for any cookie, candy combo you wanted to try.  3 ingredients and fail proof.

I made these for my husband's birthday party, and everyone passed on the cake so that they could eat these yummies instead! Personally, I thought that they were too sweet. I am giving this recipe a 5 simply because I seem to have been outnumbered by those that thought they were simply heaven on earth. Next time I make them I will use semisweet morsels instead of the white chocolate chips, to cut the sweetness. I will also try other flavors of sandwich cookie - lemon, vanilla, etc. I rate these highly because they are SO SIMPLE and the results are so impressive.

These were eaten up very quickly, and garnered extreme feeling of joy from my husband, family, and coworkers.    I used a food processor for the crumbs, and chilled the oreo balls first before dipping.  I just microwaved the almond bark, and it worked out really well.

These are yummy!  They are super rich, but after chilling over night, they taste even better.  I used vanilla candy for coating and drizzled melted milk chocolate over the top.  I dipped a few of them in the milk chocolate as well.  I had some issues with dipping, but it just resulted in an uneven crust, nothing to effect the flavor, and they still look good after setting, so it worked out well in the end anyway.  Thanks for the recipe!

I usually don't rate recipes but in this case, I had to! These were delicious! I followed the recipe as written. I had to leave the dough in the refrigerator and take out small scoops to work with at a time. It was easier to roll the dough when cold. My co workers LOVED it!

I have been making these for a couple of years..I also call them oreo truffles. To make dipping easier make them into balls place them on a cookies sheet covered with wax paper and then freeze them before dipping in the almond bark. I use a slotted spoon, I just drop the ball into the chocolate and then pick it up with the spoon and shake off the extra. As long as the balls stay frozen it works pretty well.

Absolutely divine!  I can totally see an addiction forming!  Definately freeze the dough really well before making the balls and after making them before you dip them.  I dropped them in a small bowl of melted white chocolate candy coating and just scooped them out with a spoon and they came out perfect.

I used store brand oreo cookies. They were better because they didn't have as much cream filling as real oreos. I also used store brand chocolate chip cookies. Ground them in the food processor. Dipped them in Wilton's dark chocolate, and drizzled them with white chocolate. Brought them to a baby shower and they were gone before i could even have one.

These didn't last long, everyone loved them. The only thing I did different was I used a small ice cream scoop or candy dipper to make the balls that also gave me all uniform sized cookies.

After trying several methods thru the years of dipping truffles I found the best way is to dip the bottoms first.  After they're set, the bottoms make good handles to hold the ball and then dip the top. Very very easy to make in a food processor and the family loved them.

I actually made this after a cake did not quite turn out as planned.  I used chocolate cake and vanilla frosting and for me it was not sweet enough until I coated the balls in chocolate.  I do not like almond bark.

These were easy to make and so yummy!  I recommend chilling the rolled cookies for an hour before dipping in white candy coating.  Like others suggested, I melted my candy coating with about a T. shortening.  Everyone raved and asked for the recipe!  I am making these for Christmas gifts this year.

These are good, and pretty easy.  I've done a few variations of these: all-natural chocolate sandwich cookies and, neufchatel cheese and real white chocolate; Trader Joe's vanilla sandwich cookies with Neufchatel with both real white chocolate and milk chocolate, etc.  This is a good recipe to play with.  Drizzle with contrasting colors.

These are good but dipping can be a challenge. After experimenting, this is what i found to be the easiest method. After rolling each cookie ball, i placed each one in a mini muffin cup liner, poured the white chocolate bark over them and drizzled with milk chocolate. The dark chocalate does a great job at covering imperfections. After they hardened, i put each one in a clean  muffin liner for a beautiful presentation.(they have a small bald spot on the underside with this method but it doesn't show in the muffin liners)

All my family and friends loved this recipe.  I used 10 oz of semi sweet chips with 1/2 bar paraffin wax melted together as the coating rather than the white chocolate.  The semi-sweet was marvelous.

Used the mint flavored Oreos-fabulous! I only have a mini food processor, so I crumbled the cookies by hand, then placed in batches to the f proc. to fully crumble, used about 7 oz of the cream cheese (just stirred it in,) refrig. the balls for a while then tried a toothpick and spoon to dip into the bark (spoon worked best for me.) Topped w/green sprinkles and plan on calling these "Mint Cookie Snowballs" for cookie exchanges - LOVE these!

I made these today for a Christmas party.  I used vanilla sandwich cookies and first crushed them in a large Ziploc bag.  Then I put them into my mixer bowl and added the softened cream cheese.  After they were mixed well I stuck the whole bowl into the fridge for 20 minutes.  Then I made the balls, but they were still too soft to roll easily in the almond bark, abd instead almost seemed to melt.  So I made up all the balls and put them back into the fridge for 1 hour.  After they were well chilled they rolled easily in the almond bark.  They were all gone in no time and people said they really liked them.  Personally, I didn't care for the taste/texture (maybe I ground the cookies too small? or would like the chocolate?), but that's just me I guess.  Everyone else loved them.

I used Dulce de Leche Oreos in this recipe and these came out SO rich. I halved the recipe and actually had to use more cookies than I should have, as the dough was really gummy and gooey, but they tasted decent. I don't think I'll be making these again...just a little too rich for my tastes.

These were great--an instant hit at my husband's work!  I used chocolate almond bark instead of white, and also drizzled with semi-sweet chocolate.  I definately will be putting these on my christmas-candy trays!

I followed a lot of the tips (freeze dough and drizzle with chocolate) and made these for a charity bake sale. Not a hard recipe, it's just a little messy.

The family loved these. Do chill the dough before rolling into balls. If you're slow at rolling them chill them again before coating them. Thank goodness these are bite sized. The are very rich.

The dough was too messy to work with.  I could never get mine to stay together very well.  Also, the white chocolate is too thick to dip something so messy in.  Also, do you keep them refrigerated or what?  Although the ingredients are all good, I just couldn't get this one together very well.  Sorry, it'll be awhile before I attempt it again.

I made this for a cookie platter and it turned out great! Chill the "batter" after mixing and again after rolling into balls.  I drizzeled colored candy coating over the top (after coating) and they looked great.  Three people asked for the recipe.  Easy and very good!

I had heard rave reviews for this recipe, both at this site and in my community and I have to say I'm not entirely impressed. The cookie dough, even if chilled overnight, stays very moist. The white bark is still fairly thick when melted and because of the heat, your white bark ends up speckled with oreo crumbs by the end of the process. Also I haven't figured out how to neatly remove them from a toothpick or lobster fork once dipped so they don't look too pretty when completed. I always thought I was a decent cook...

These were very good but super sweet. Next time I may just roll them in cocoa powder or powdered sugar rather than coat them. I love them though!

These are great!  At my party, everyone loved them and couldn't believe what they were made of.  They do take a while to make so be prepared. As others suggested, I think it would be help to chill the dough first before dipping into the chocolate. At room temp, the dough is a little sticky and messy. I used the amounts listed and got 4 dozen from mine-- guess I made them smaller but I thought they were a good size.

Just loved these cookies-- and have passed on this much requested recipe to many-- very easy and taste delicious.  I used a cookie scoop (similiar to ice cream scoop just smaller)- made the balls uniform and less messy.  Also excellent made with mint oreos, choc oreos etc-- great dipped in milk choc bark as well though like the vanilla the best.  The only thing i don't care for about this recipe is the name-- one friend suggested Dirt Cake Cookies, another suggested (for holiday time) reindeer droppings..hmmm...i'll keep thinking.  give these a try, you won't be disappointed!!

This is not worth the mess!  They don’t even taste good.  No flavor other than sugar sweet.

It’s a great idea, very delicious recipe, I followed it exactly. My son and husband liked them, but for me and my daughter they are WAY too sweet to even enjoy one of them. I wish there was a way to cut the sweetness, because they would be great otherwise!

I made this according to the instructions. I followed the tip to chill the cookie balls before dipping them which worked out well. These were simple to make. My grandkids helped make them into balls.  I dipped them and they added sprinkles. They really enjoyed making them but loved eating them even more! I plan to make this recipe again using different types of cookies.

Make these all the time. Always a hit and everyone loves them! I've made them round, and heart shaped, and now I'm gonna make them football shape for Big Game on Sunday. Such an easy recipe and they're always first to go!

What a creative treat, but sadly it was so sweet I could NOT swallow! Me and my son also saved one for the next day, but by four to five hours it could actually have been a football! Every thing was rock solid as if it had been in the desert for three months! It was a fun idea, but an idea that I will not use again.

Delicious and easy! I made these over Christmas for my cousins` kids (ages 3 - 13) and they loved them. I coated some in milk chocolate, some in white, and some in dark, and threw on some Christmas sprinkles. They looked amazing...even the adults couldn`t keep their hands off of them!

These are great! I made them with Guittard vanilla chips for the dipping chocolate.Passed some out to neighbors for Christmas.I like them better with the vanilla chips for dipping a lot more then milk chocolate or semi sweet chocolate.

These are also really good with the vanilla Oreos (Uh Ohs) and a vanilla chip coating. I don't care for white almond bark so the chips work great for me.

I used chocolate candy coating and it turned out great. I also used less than a pound of sandwich cookies and it was fine. It is the best cookie balls I have ever tasted.

TBH, I haven't made this recipe, but my mom had these at her house when I went to visit one day. She didn't even bother with the candy coating. I thought they would be gross when she told me what was in them, but dared it anyway. I think I ate a half dozen all by myself. They aren't nearly as sweet as I feared. LOVE these fun little dough balls!

Super easy recipe. I love it, but the only thing I did differently is use Oreos in stead of the other cookies and you could also just melt some white chocolate in stead of vanilla candy coating. Still soooo good! ??

This is one of my husband's favorites, so I tried this recipe. They were delicious! I formed the balls and refrigerated before dipping and here's a tip: If the Vanilla Almond bark is too thick when melted, you can add a little Crisco to thin to your liking. Turned out great.

Every year I like to try new recipes for Christmas and out of all the new ones I tried, this one was by far my favourite this year. I read the reviews beforehand and used the suggestions of freezing the dough before dipping and it worked great. Try to eat these right out of the freezer....you won't be disappointed!!

Can't understand all the great reviews for this? First off dipping them with a fork into candy coating sounds easier than it is. Tried all the tricks (chilling dough, freezing for 20 minutes prior to dipping) awkward, and messy to say the least. If you want sprinkles? Oh wow..you better have a partner there sprinkling while you are dipping, and struggling trying to get these off the fork. Bottom line? The taste...taste like wet Oreo cookies coated with hard shelled vanilla. Not my idea of a tasty treat to bring to Christmas gathering.

I made these last night with my kids in thought. I'm not a big fan of cream cheese and thought they weren't going to taste that good, but found these fabulous. They weren't too sweet and they filled my chocolate craving that I've had for awhile. I definitely will be making these again. Thank you for sharing.

Easy thing to make and bring to gatherings. I used only 3/4 of the cream cheese, melted chocolate chips to coat and sparkled with peppermint flakes. Came out great.

It took me a long time to get this recipe down, and was time-consuming from the start. Here's why: my food chopper can only fit 4 cookies at a time so I was already doomed from this step forward. Because this step took an hour and 20 minutes, it delayed the whole process. My suggestion? Use a larger food chopper and not a tiny one like mine. People at the New Year's Eve party loved it. I made 1.5 times the recipe and used one 8 oz. cream cheese and it turned out great. I liked it but I didn't love it. The fun part was coating and decorating them.

These are good, I think they fall short of amazing, but they are good.  I really don't think they taste too much different than just an oreo cookie when doing the recipe as written.  To make them easier to dip I froze the dough.  I had zero problem that way.  While they are yummy, they cost me about nine dollars to make, so I don't know if I'll make them again or next time use my money on a different dessert.  I do like this dessert because it is easy to eat just one and feel like you've had enough.

I made the mistake of using "triple/double" oreos.  What a mess!  They taste super good but was very difficult to roll.  I had to refrigerate them quite awhile to get them to set.  I rolled them in white choc bark.  Ummmm good but very messy to make.

I loved them! I knew enough to put the balls in the freezer on a cookie sheet like many other recipes that are similar (peanut butter chocolate balls).  I used the food processor and then sprinkled in some sea salt to cut the super sweetness.  It really did the trick!  I used the bulk chocolate from the supermarket as it's better than chips or almond bark (Belgian)and melted in a double boiler.  I would add some wax next time to the chocolate to add a bit of thickness and sheen, about the size of a lipstick per batch.  That works with well with other recipes.

These are sooo good and makes it seem like you did a lot more work than you really did! I am curious to try other combinations.. Nutter Butters with cream cheese, dipped in chocolate candy coating, and drizzled with melted peanut butter chips could be good!

I made these for the church potluck. I made a double batch, one chocolate and one peanut butter.  There was not a single one left.  One guy told my husband, "hey, you have to try one of these--they're the best thing here!"  My teens loved how easy they were to make.  They already have the recipe memorized.  Thanks for a winner.  One thing I did notice, chilling the cookies before dipping them in melted chocolate yielded some cracks as the temperatures equalized. But no one complained!

This turned out AMAZING! I made about 1" balls and chilled them. Then I just used white chocolate chips with Gulf wax melted down in a double-boiler. I then placed each chocolate ball on wooden kabob skewers for dipping... made it so very easy! I then used a little left over oreo-cookie powder/puree to roll some of the balls in right after dipping and melted down chocolate chips for a drizzle on the others. So cute! Awesome for a sweet treat after a romantic dinner!

Did not vary from the recipe, but make sure the chocolate filling is very cold or it will fall apart.  That was my fault, but easy to fix. I think they are gone as quick as they are made!

I made these for my husband , after Christmas. Although I have never really liked Oreos, he LOVES them. I used white chocolate, his favorite, to dip one dozen of them.  The remainder I dipped in a very good brand of bittersweet chocolate, and they are absolutely scrumptious - melt in your mouth! He'll have Oreos more often now!

These are quite tasty.  They are very rich, so you can't eat too many.  I made them with the holiday candy cane Jo-Jo's (Trader Joe's version of an Oreo).  Although these cookie balls are easy to make, the process is quite time-consuming.

I used these as the favors for a peas-in-the-pod twins baby shower.  I used almond bark that I tinted light green and put two in each favor box.  They were a hit!  Simple and delicious.  I found the trick to dipping them in the melted bark was, as others have suggested, chill the rolled balls before dipping and making sure the melted bark was warm.  Once it gets too cool it starts getting gloppy.  Still tasted great, just didn't look as good. Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe!  I tried regular and vanilla oreos; vanilla candy coating, white chocolate, milk chocolate, and semi-sweet chocolate.  For the regular oreos, I like the candy coating best.  For the vanilla oreos, white chocolate was best.

I loved these and so did everyone else! Especially my 3 year old brother who loves cupcakes. These were his perfect size and tasted just like a little cupcake. I mixed the cake and 1/2 can of frosting in a stand mixer until doughy then refrigerated for 2 hours, rolled into balls then froze before putting on a stick and dipping. I will make these again and again.

These are delicious... everyone at my party gobbled them up. People kept raving about them. Definitely an excellent party food. I used melted white chocolate on mine and decorated with sprinkles. I crushed the oreos by putting them in a plastic zipper bag and pounding it with a potato masher. Dipping them was really difficult, though, and I needed way more white chocolate than I had (one bag of chocolate chips). I just rolled the ones I couldn't dip in sprinkles, and they still looked festive and tasted great. Thanks for the recipe!

These are delicious and so easy to make. I've made these a few times for parties, and they are gone within the hour! Although they can be a bit time consuming, what with rolling all of the balls out, and then coating and decorating each one, the recipe is very simple, and it's hard to mess up. Refrigerating the balls before you dip them will save a lot of mess, as I had a few crumble apart on me toward the end. The end product is SO worth the time and effort put into making them. Everyone loves them!

Made for the work bake sale...and everyone loved them!  However, the dipping took awhile...and I used more chocolate than called for...but they were very good!

These are really good! I like them far better than the cake balls - not so sweet and sticky/greasy. I used about 3/4 Oreo crumbs and 1/4 crumbs from a batch of chocolate cookies I overbaked last week. This is a great way to use up stale cookies (like we ever have any) or 'mistakes.' Thanks for the recipe!!

Very good.  Super easy.  I had a hard time dipping them in chocolate and having them look nice.  They seemed too soft and I froze them prior to dipping.

Fantastic! A little hard to dip, but they taste so good! The first time I made these I used Double Stuf Oreos and dipped them in white Ghirardelli chocolate and I think they came out a bit too sweet. The second time I made them, I used regular Oreos and white Nestle morsels, and, while I got the sweetness factor under control, I wasn't happy with the Nestle. I think next time I will use regular Oreos and white Ghirardelli chocolate and they will be perfect. :) Oh, and I just threw the Oreos and the cream cheese into my food processor and let it do all the work. Everyone who tasted them all said the same thing: "I love the gooey-ness!"

Yum.  I used peanut butter instead of cream cheese, and it was delicious.  I also dyed the chocolate red for valentines day and it was such a nice little treat for my husband.

Okay, so I misread the recipe on this one, but they still turned out pretty good. Instead of reading that the recipe called for cream cheese, I read cream cheese FROSTING. I suppose I associated these with cake balls, another recipe on this site. The balls had a great taste still, even with melted white chocolate chips instead of bark (the store was out). Next time, I will make these with actual cream cheese, and hopefully they will be better/more sophisticated.

These are very good. I didn't have a food processor, so I "beat" the oreos with a rolling pin. I don't think the oreos were ground as "fine" as they should be, but still good. After mixing them with the cream cheese, I rolled them into balls and put them in the fridge for about 20 minutes. I then melted dark chocolate and dipped them, and put them back in the fridge. After about 25 minutes, I melted white chocolate and drizzled that over them. I put them back in the fridge after that again for about 20 minutes. I made them for a dinner party and people said they "looked fancy." They were all eaten too!

These were a hit! They are very rich!  I used melted white chocolate to coat the outside.  I think I would like to try the almond bark though next time.  I made the cookie mixture and then let it sit in the fridge to get firmer.  Then I rolled them into little balls and put in the freezer for about 15 min so they'd not fall apart when dipping in chocolate.  Great recipe!!

these are super easy to make and everyone loves them (and requests them!).  you can also use peanut butter oreos with peanut butter chips to make a good variation.

i made these from a recipe called "oreo truffles" or something like that. they are soooo good! i used the oreos with the pink strawberry flavored filling and also the green mint flavored ones. i DO also recommend chilling the centers before dipping in chocolate. they can get kind of hard to handle and sticky if you dip them right away. have fun!

my sister and i have a recipe similar to this, we use the oreos and cream cheese filling but for the outer layer we melt semi-sweet chocolate and dip the little calls into it, we call them chocolate truffles and they are the most delicious things in the world! everyone loves them and always asks for them! they are soooo addicting too! you really can't eat just one

When I first tasted this they tasted like mushy Oreos coated in almond bark... yuck! However, after refrigerating them they tasted a lot better.  This gets 4 stars because they're very easy to make, come out looking fantastic and my bf and his friend really liked them.

Yummmm! After a few failed attempts at dipping them, setting them in the fridge for a while definitely helped. They definitely should be renamed Oreo Truffle!

Amazing. This is a sexy little recipe that my husband adores! I used Oreos with white chocolate....delicious. The dipping process is a bit precarious; I found that toothpicks help. Also, don't make the balls too big; one-inch is sufficient. Otherwise, they're very difficult to work with.

These are very tasty, and easy to customize depending on your preferences/holiday. The best recipes are the ones that are this versatile, so I'm giving this 5 stars. I found that it was easier to mix the cream cheese and cookies evenly when I warmed up both in the same bowl in the microwave for about a minute, softening the cheese (don't nuke it for so long as to melt the cheese, though). I then used a pastry knife to mix it up as a regular spoon didn't do a very good job. I then used a cookie scoop to help form the balls. I can see myself using all kinds of chocolates and coatings other than the candy coating in the original recipe when making these depending on my mood. I can also see using Nilla wafers or some other type of cookie other than Oreo types, and even pressing a surprise ingredient into the center of the ball like an almond or caramel before coating if I want to go really fancy. It's so easy to make! I love this recipe and the variations on it are endless. Thank you for sharing it!!

Brought these into work today and everyone keeps raving about them and asking where I bought them! Used fat free cream cheese and reduced fat cookies. Definitely recommend refrigerating the balls before dipping and sprinkling something (cookie crumbs or sprinkles) on top to cover up the dipping mistakes. I find them to be very rich  (only reason I didn't give 5 stars), so next time I will make smaller balls. Have fun with these!

We make these at Christmas and they are delish!!!  We dip them a little differently.  We do put them in the freezer for a bit and then we put a toothpick in the center and dip it leaving a hole in the top center that shows the filling.  It's like we dip "buckeyes" in our area. (Peanut Butter Balls)  I have submitted a photo of ours for you to see.  These are very popular and easy!!

I have made this exactly as listed.  It is very good this way, but I really think that it is a 'base' recipe.  I recommend trying out some variations-one of my favorites is using Mint oreos in place of the regular oreos.  Also, I dip them in dark chocolate (almond bark) and then drizzle them with other colored almond bark (for example-when I make the mint flavored ones, I use white almond bark and use green food coloring to turn it green).  This also help identify what the different flavors are.  I get LOTS of compliments when I make these. Enjoy! :)

I got this recipe from a friend over a year ago, and everytime I make them people ask for the recipe. I haven't met a person that didn't like these. I do stick to Oreo cookies,though. I think it makes all the difference.

These are really easy and so yummy! I use my food processor to crush the oreos. I roll into balls and place in freezer for about 10 minutes before dipping into chocolate. I love these dipped in dark chocolate, then drizzeled with white chocolate or sprinkled with extra oreo crumbs.

My m-i-l first introduced me to these cookies at Christmas. Beware!! They are addictive beyond belief, and you'll wake up in the middle of the night craving them! I look forward to Christmas with the in-laws every year because of these cookies. They're to die for!

This is a fantastic recipe.  They are quite simple to make and delicious to boot!  The only thing I did different was use white chocolate for dipping instead of the candy coating.  Rich and decadent!!  Also, drizzle with the milk chocolate or save some crumbs to sprinkle on top for a beautiful rich-looking truffle.

I have been making these for years and my friends are always asking for them.  They are always a big hit.  Don't be afraid to use the different varieties of Oreo's that are sometimes seansonally available... My kids loved the ones made with the mint oreo's

I found this recipe a few years ago. My family loves them. I make the balls and then chill them before dipping. I also get the kids involved. Kids love to dip. Have extra chocolate as they eat alot. I use 2 spoons and roll in chocolate. I don't care if they are messy they taste the same.   Thanks for the recipe!!!

My biggest recommendation on these is DON'T refrigerate them.  They get very HARD if you do!  The taste was good and the few ingredients were economical, but they are VERY time consuming and MESSY to roll.  I used my food processor to make the cookie crumbs and added the cream cheese in it.  If I were to make this again, but I don't think I will because of the time involved, I would crush some of the cookies by hand to give it some more texture and chunks.  
Cool idea tho! Thanks!

These are great - very simple to make but it looks like you spent hours on them. I made them in the food processor and chilled them for a couple of hours prior to dipping. Will definately be making these again.

These tasted good but they were hard to make.  I mean, the ingredients were easy to mix together, obviously but they got too soft and got stuck in the candy coating when I tried to dip them.  They also didn't look like perfect circles but rather lumpy.  So if you want something that tastes good and you don't care how it looks then I'd say make it!  If you want something with good presentation this just isn't it.

These are great truffles!  I freeze after shaping into balls for about an hour before dipping into the coating.  I've drizzled some melted chocolate chips over top the white coating as well, for a different look.  I first had these around the winter holiday, and then I decided to make for the holiday to put on trays.  Very rich but very good.  Can't stop at just one!

These were okay.  I found them very messy to work with when rolling the ball shape and it kept slipping off the utensil when dipping in the chocolate.  I still gave it 4 stars because the taste was very good.  But still not sure if I will make again because of the mess.

I'm an activity director at an assisted living. Some of the resident's and I made these in our cooking club (our very first meeting) and they turned out great! We put a big platter of them out so everyone could try and everyone loved them. Easy to make. And tasted great!

I have been making these since forever, and thought that they were only a Central Iowa thing.  They are kind of time consuming, but delicious none-the less.  I've had people ask me if it was brownies inside!  Definately try this.
