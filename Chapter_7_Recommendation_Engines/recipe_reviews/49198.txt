My family really liked this recipe!  I made a few changes.  I had left-over pork loin, so I used that.  I had no fresh (or tidbits or chunks) of pineapple, so I used crushed.  It was good, but having the chunks will probably be more tasty.  I also had no snow peas, so I added fresh asparagus.  Yum!  I also added more plum sauce than was called for.  I thought about adding sesame seeds.  I think that might be a nice addition.  I'll save that for the next time I make this recipe.  Thank you for posting!

Very good!  I added soy sauce and teriyaki sauce.  Cooked garlic and onion then added pork, I did not remove garlic and onion.  I used canned pineapple and added cornstarch to the juice.  Kids enjoyed.

Tasty and quick (I didn't cook the pork in batches).  Had no fresh pinapple on hand, so I used canned, and added a bit of the juice.  Served with steamed white rice.  Kids and husband loved it!

I didn't have plum sauce, so I used sweet and sour dipping sauce and I followed the other review and added a tad of corn starch.  Also, I added a dash of tamari sauce for some added flavor.
Definetly will make again!

Pretty much amazing! I made this for some company, so total there were four of us. I doubled the recipe so I could have the left overs for lunch today but it was completely gone yesterday!

My husband and I both love this recipe!  It is really easy to make--I also did not cook the pork in seperate batches and used canned pineapple.  I was expecting the chili pepper to give it a little bit of spice, but it wasn't spicy at all.  So the next time I made it I substituted about 6 small serrano peppers and it was wonderful!  Very sweet, very spicy.

This recipe was pretty good. The only thing I did different was used canned pineapple instead. One thing I would add is maybe some cornstarch to thicken the juice a little. and also add a little bit of the pineapple juice (from the can) to it, the original recipe was a little too bland for me. But I'll definatly make it again. (Just with a few simple variations.)

This is a great easy recipe! I made a few changes to it because I didn't have all the ingredients- instead of snow peas, I tossed in cabbage, and I ate the stir-fry rolled up in a fat-free tortilla.  Next time, i'd definitely season the pork a little to add a bit more flavor, but overall, I'm thrilled at how fast and delicious this recipe is!

We thought is was OK.  I marinated the pork in terriyaki sauce for 30 minutes prior to cooking.  I think that helped with the overall flavor.  I added a lot of extra plum sauce and used water chestnuts too.  I would make it again if I had a pineapple that I had to use.

Too sweet to be called stir-fry.  This recipe would more accurately be called a sweet and sour pork dish.  My younger kids liked it, but it was not a hit with the rest of the family.

Excellent stir fry, my husband loved it, and asked for more!  This recipe is a keeper, also I am on WW's and this is a great recipe with brown rice, the Pork Stir fry is worth 7 points!!

Put my pork loin in the slow cooker during the day so the meat was ready at supper time.  Used canned pineapple and extra plum sauce as suggested.  Other great additions used were sesame seeds, ground white pepper, hot mustard and chow mein noodles. I served this over rice noodles.

This was excellent.  The only thing I changed was instead of peppers I used no salt extra spicy.

This was great, simple easy and fast. Next time I'll quarter chop the onions instead of rings. I also added mini corn too

Husband loved it and he's one picky eater.  It's very simple to make.  I will use different meats like shrimp or chicken as well.

This was lacking some depth for us.  Ginger?  It was OK, but nothing to write home about.
