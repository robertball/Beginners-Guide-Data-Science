This garlic sauce is excellent! Very authentic. I experienced 5-star results by frying, Chiang Mai style, instead of baking.  A batch of about 7 drumstucks were marinated in a mixture of 1 tbsp fish sauce,  1 tsp salt, 1 tsp white pepper, and 8 cloves of garlic for 30 minutes. The chicken was then fried in vegetable oil in a wok maintained as close as possible to 350 degrees for about 10 minutes. I also substituted 4 thai chili peppers instead of jalapenos. The garlic sauce is the pefect complement. My wife's family is from Phuket and shes tells me that the sauce reminds her of the taste she used to encounter  at the street vendors waiting outside her school when she was a kid. Awesome recipe!

I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, with the exception of substituting Thai birdseye chiles (prik ki nu) for the jalepenos and increasing proportions of ingredients because I used a 4-lb bag of thawed drumettes.  I used the sauce as a marinade overnight, and then shook the marinade off of the wings.  I then placed them on a jelly roll pan sprayed with non-stick spray and baked them at 450F until they had a nice color.  I had reserved the marinade; I boiled it down to a semi-thick glace, and spooned it over the wings.  I then garnished with extra chiles and served with the 'Satay Sauce' (adding garlic and ginger) found on this site.  SUPER good, but get your mileage out of the sauce by marinading first.

I had bought a bag of frozen wings by mistake so decided to use them in a recipe that didn't need to be fried and this fit the bill (or so I thought).  On the advice of other reviewers, I cut the fish sauce to 1/4, and also cut down on the sugar...using half brown and half white.  I had to read the amount of garlic twice(and I am a garlic lover)  1/3 CUP of crushed garlic seemed like a bit much but I proceeded.  That pretty much equals a whole bulb of garlic once you get it crushed.  I was hesitant to sautee that much garlic in oil for fear of getting too brown and tasting bitter.  I lightly sauteed it in some wok oil to add a bit of sesame flavor to the dish.  I used 2 whole jalepenos with the seeds in, as I like heat.  When I tasted the sauce, it was very overpowering with garlic and not pleasant tasting garlic at that.  I added about a tsp. of sesame oil for flavor and even though that helped, it still was too sweet, I could taste the fish sauce, and that overpowering garlic flavor was too much.  I put the sauce on the wings about the last 10 min. of baking to try to mellow the flavor along with some sesame seeds on top to toast.  It was a little better after being in the oven, but there was no way I could have stood that sauce to just pour over at the end.

These were really good but we didn't find them spicy at all.  We marinated the wings in the sauce as suggested.  For a potluck gathering, we baked the chicken ahead of time, then put the wings in the crock pot and poured the sauce on top of them.  We kept them warm on low for several hours and they were excellent!  The second time we made them, we added soy sauce and ginger to the sauce.

This is a really good recipe that will allow an experienced cook to make subtle changes in the base flavor ingredients, as desired.  Some ginger is a good idea. I made this exactly as described the first time, and there's plenty of sauce to handle 5 lbs. of wings, no problem.

I was excited to find this recipe, as Thai food is a favorite in my home.  To be fair to the submitter, I didn't change a thing while making the recipe.  DH and I couldn't take the sweetness.  I will try the concept again but with many changes.

They were good. I think next time I will go more spicy and less fish sauce.

these were okay. I used less sugar and chili powder as I didn't have jalapenos or paprika on hand. Edible and taste good just not really my taste.

Maybe it's just me not caring for this flavor combination, because I certainly like all the ingredients (however, less sugar). I would recommend moving step 3 to step 1, since roasting the chicken wings takes much longer than preparing the sauce. Sorry, but not a keeper.

These were very easy to make and I LOVE that it didn't require the mess of frying the wings.  I made them for a party and what a hit!  The combination of flavors is great and it looks so nice on a platter.  There wasn't a single wing left, and several people asked me for the recipe.  As one who isn't even much a fan of wings, I'll definitely be making this recipe again!

These were tasty. Not overly memorable, but a good solid recipe to use up chicken wings. I can't bear to use that partially hydrogenated vegetable oil stuff, so I used rendered chicken fat from my homemade stock. My husband said this was sort of a sweet and sour sauce. Don't be afraid to add extra jalapenos.

This turned out very good. The garlic sauce taste very similar to sweet & sour sauce.  I would make it again.

This sauce was awesome!  I made a half batch of this recipe & my husband & I nearly polished off all of them!  I made some changes based on what I had on hand but I stayed true to the essence of the recipe.  I only had 5 good cloves of garlic - it was enough but a few more would have been nice.  (Remember, pressing garlic reduces the volume greatly, so if your measuring, I think the recipe means chopped, not pressed.)  I reduced the sugar a bit & used raw turbinado sugar, I used water instead of broth to keep it simple, and I used my homemade crushed dried red asian chili and sesame oil sauce instead of jalepenos (like the kind of hot chili sauce you can order on the side in a Thai restaurant.)

Very good. This recipe makes some sticky spicy wings.  I added 1 tbsp of brown sugar to sweeten the taste and this made it all the better. A great recipe that was easy and delicious. Served with asian sticky rice.

This was fantastic.  The only things I changed were to use a milder pepper in place of the jalapeno since I can't eat "very spicy" food.  I also had to bake the chicken more like an hour and a half to get the level of crispy I wanted.  I added the sauce the last 15 min. of baking to make the sauce really stick.  Yum.

I used this recipe on some wings I made for the super bowl. I had this kind, original hot, and cajun. These in particular were so yummy, they were awesome.

My first time making the recipe I followed it exactly and it turned out great ( i actually wish I used more jalapeno b/c i wanted it to be more spicy). Then second time I was making this for marinade for steaks which is why I am writing this review.

DO NOT use apple cider vinegar. The first time I just used white vinegar and it tasted great. This second (for steaks) i used apple cider. Then when it was done it had a very funky taste. so DO NOT use apple cider vinegar.

The sauce is something of an acquired taste and needs some getting used to. However, once that is done, it tastes great with the chicken. For personal tastes, I halved the sugar as we are not huge on overly sweet sauces and moderated the fish sauce to accommodate the halved sugar. Overall a very addictive sauce and a pretty easy dish to whip up. Note: I used 3 dried Thai red chili instead of jalapeños since I have a bag of it. Would highly recommend using that over jalapeños as it adds a somewhat smoky flavor to the sauce and spicer too.

I've never cooked Thai food before and based on some of the reviews I was worried about using the fish sauce.  The smell of the stuff when I opened the bottle did little to allay my fears.  But I went ahead and used the amount in the recipe and it turned out fantastic!  The sauce blends nicely but still adds a distinct flavour to the sauce.  This recipe is a keeper.

This sauce is amazing! I use this sauce for everything... salmon, chicken wings, burgers.. etc. I also like to add chili peppers or dices of bell peppers in the sauce. The sugar helps to even out the saltiness in the fish sauce and makes a great sauce :)

This is an outstanding recipe!  Instead of frying the chicken, I chose to go the healthy route of making an oven baked fried chicken.  I didn’t have cornstarch, so, I replaced it with flour.  Great simple recipe.
