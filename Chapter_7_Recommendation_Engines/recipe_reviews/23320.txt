This is a very easy recipe to follow.  I highly recommend it.  It's even easier if you buy the 
store bought crust - 2 inch sweet tart shells.  Bake the shells for 8 minutes at 400 degree tobrown.

Great for pot-lucks.  Also freezes very well.

If you want something really quick, this is it. (I bought tart shells.) I've never had pecan pie, so I don't know if it does taste like the real thing.  This is the second time I've made them.  Do not serve them chilled!  They'll be like hard candy wrapped in pastry.

These really are fantastic. I followed the recipe exactly and had really great results. The flavor is excellent. Watch how full you fill the cups or you'll have stuck filling all over your pan - but they'll taste great no matter what!

These cookies are good. My husband loved them so much he told me they were awful and I couldn't give them away to anyone! After reading many helpful hints, I would like to offer my own. 1. I sprayed my muffin pans to prevent sticking and difficult removal. 2. 1 tablespoon of crust is really 1 packed tablespoon. 3. The cookies did want to stick a bit around the edges. So used the backside of a thin blade parring knife and drug it around the edges until the cookie popped out. I also had to reheat the mixture as it cooled before I got to the last batch.

These little tartlets are delicious! They do taste just like a pecan pie. They did take me a while to make, but my mini muffin pan is pretty small. I would suggest using a pan for 24 mini muffins instead of 12. These also freeze beautiful.

Have been making these for Thanksgiving and Christmas for about 3 yrs in cupcake pans.  They are always the first desert gone.   They are time consuming but easy to make and I'm not sure if you can fail,  I haven't yet.  I finally invested in proper tart pans this year as I can see these will be at our Holiday table for years to come.   Well worth the time to make

I am now starting my 3rd "batch" of these great tartlets.  My family loves them, very easy to make.  Couple of short cuts made it fool-proof.  I use a cookie scoop, (similar to ice cream scoop to get consistency in size). These are dropped into pan and a shot glass dipped in powdered sugar keeps it from sticking when pressing dough to get "cup" shape. Chocolate dropped into the cup before filling is a nice taste surprise as coconut placed on top before the last baking.  Highly reccommend this recipe.  It will now be on of my holiday favorites.

These are good!  They have a nice flavor although they are pretty sweet, but I guess that's the nature of pecan pie.  They're actually not too difficult to make, but it was kind of tricky getting them out of the tins.  I flash froze them before removing them, and that seemed to help.  They freeze really well.

These are good but a pain to make…messy, sticky and time consuming. Let the tarts cool completly before you try and remove them from the pan. I had to use a knife to get most of them out because the filling sticks to the pan. My crust also rose quite a bit so after the initial baking I used the head of an instant read thermometer to squish each one to make room for the filling. This recipe made exactly 36 tarts, but I did have to add a little extra flour because the dough was really sticky.

The tarts taste amazing, when brought to a work potluck there were none left after the first half hour. The crust, in my opinion, really makes these tarts, since it's not your usual pie crust. 

When it comes to preparing however, the crust does puff up quite a bit. And for me, less seemed to be more. If I tried to fill the shells up to the brim with the filling, they ended up crumbling, or looked fairly unpresentable. However, I still had more than enough beautiful tarts, and definitely plan on using this recipe again.

First off, do not use paper cupcake liners!!  The filling will essentially 'glue' the liner to the crust/filling and will be virtually impossible to remove.  The filling did not taste ‘exactly’ like pecan pie either; I thought it tasted like a caramel pecan pie.  Not a bad flavor, though.  I was unable to eat more than a half of a pie because these pies had a thick and sticky caramel-ish texture that was too difficult to chew due to minor jaw problems.  This recipe only yielded about 35-40 mini pies, because the filling was not sufficient (but it had cooled some by the time I filled my last batch).  Since I do not care for vanilla wafers plain, I put them in my food processor with some sugar and a little melted butter, and processed until finely ground.  This made an excellent crust.  I probably will not try this recipe again mainly due to the fact that I can not chew them!

These little tarts were absolutely delicious!  I made them for a Thanksgiving potluck and they were a hit!  I didn't have any almond extract, and used vanilla instead..they were still very very good!  I was afraid they would be hard to make, but they were relatively quite easy.  The time making them is forgotten when you bight into these yummy delights!  Enjoy!
