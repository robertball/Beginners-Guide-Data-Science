In the interest of full disclosure, I made these bars with blueberries, not peaches. I will make them with peaches next time. That said, these bars are poetry in bakery. They're tender and sweet without being cloyingly sweet. They go great with vanilla ice cream. I may or may not have eaten all but one piece in a day, and I may or may put an ancient druidic hex on the Grandbaby Cakes lady for derailing my weight loss plan for a day. If you're thinking of making peach (or blueberry) pie, don't--make these instead. You've been warned.

7.23.18  FYI, I sliced three peaches to measure 2 cups. These baked up beautifully moist, luscious, fruity, and just full of fresh peach flavor.  Followed the recipe to the letter, but in the future, Iâ€™ll increase the cinnamon, which I thought was a bit lost.  Summer peach season will be coming to an end soon, and this was a good way to bid it farewell until next year.  ***UPDATE 6.14.19:  Had peaches to use up, I was out of vanilla, so I used almond extract instead which was equally good.  This recipe never disappoints.

I didn't have enough peaches, so used part plums. It turned out great although I'm going to try more spice next time I make it.

Let me start by saying this was surprisingly simple to make even with the substitutions I ended up having to make.  I had 5 large almost too ripe peaches so I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 12 glass pan no cooking spray so I used a bit of butter.  It turned out somehow that I had no vanilla no cinnamon or nutmeg so I used about a quarter of a teaspoon of almond extract and powdered ginger. Because of the lack of spices I chopped a half cup of pecans and added them to the topping for an added crunch. This turned out very well and satisfied my craving for both peach cobbler and pecan pie

So easy to make, and really tasty! I used my food processor to make the crumb crust, which worked great. After baking for 35 minutes, I switched my oven to broil, and kept an eye on it, just to brown up the top nicely. I just tried a piece, still warm, with a bit of whipped cream on top. So so so good! Vanilla ice cream would be great with it too. I might skip the nutmeg and bump up the cinnamon next time though, just as a personal preference. Thanks for the recipe!

Super easy to make. Baked in 8x8 used olive oil instead of cooking spray. I added more salt to both the crust and the filling. I did not have Lemon Juice. Used 2 large ripe local Peaches,  still turned out great! I will try with other fruit. I didn't actually measure, I just eyeballed, did not have negative effects. I cannot wait to try with other fruit.

Really great recipe and easy to follow.
I had strawberries that needed to be used up as well so added them to the peach mix.

The peach bars have good flavor, but the crust turned out a bit heavy for my taste. If I make it again, I'll use less of the crumb in the bottom crust and add more salt.

Delicious!  Only used half the amount of sugar.
Was plenty sweet.  I used 3 medium peaches, I think I will use 4. Next time, I like a lot of fruit.
