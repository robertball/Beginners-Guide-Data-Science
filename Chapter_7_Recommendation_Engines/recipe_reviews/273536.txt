This is surprisingly addicting! My first bite I thought, nope. But, the more I ate it, the more I wanted! I ended up eating 3 wedges! A unique mix of ingredients, but such a great variation of your typical wedge salad. This does make 4 good size side salads, even though you might think they look small at first.  Use a good quality blue cheese dressing as that will greatly affect the final outcome.  Also, watch the nuts on the grill because they can burn easily. I'm definitely making this again!
