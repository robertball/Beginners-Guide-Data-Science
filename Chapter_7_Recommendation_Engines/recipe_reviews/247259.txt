2-21-2018 ~Simple enough as is, but I went about this just a little differently, which made it even MORE simple.  Rather than cooking the shrimp first then removing it and setting it aside, I just drizzled some olive oil and butter in the pan, cooked the tomatoes and garlic briefly, then added the shrimp to the luxurious sauce awaiting it in the pan, cooking just until pink and opaque.  Serving this with zucchini ribbons instead of pasta made this a healthier, low-carb option.  Five stars all around – for simple, delicious flavor with few ingredients (usually the way that goes!) and ease of preparation.  Dinner (or in my case, lunch) served in just a few minutes – and with ingredients I nearly always have on hand.

Delicious!!  Quick and super easy to make. I used 1 lb of shrimp and kept the rest of the ingredients in the same amount.  I topped it off with green onions and a sprinkle of a
fresh Asiago cheese.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Super simple to make, and so delicious! I used diced up cherry tomatoes and added a bit of cayenne (for the pepper). With my summer bounty of basil coming, we'll be making this one again for sure!

DELICIOUS!! I made this really quick for my husband one evening after work.  I kept to the recipe and had no issues.  On my birthday celebration everyone ended up iced in at our home (10 People) so I made more and they apologized for me cooking on my birthday but was glad I did because they LOVED IT!!  Couldn't stop raving about how delicious it was.  Thx for sharing the recipe.

Very delicious and simple pasta dish! I really enjoyed the garlic butter sauce with the fresh tomatoes. The shrimp were cooked perfectly and soaked up all of that sauce. It was a hit among the friends I served it to. Will definitely make again!

My fam loved it. The recipe is very easy and I think it would allow for folks to add more vegetables, such as artichokes. I liked the clean taste that this recipe has. Keeper!!!

If you like delicious shrimp and pasta - this is a dish for you!  This is one of my favorite "results" to date!
I followed the directions as written, dicing the tomato into petite diced, and heated all together thoroughly in Step 3.  We were so hungry, I'm afraid I forgot to garnish - but we loved it any way!!
Be sure to serve with some garlic bread, to sop up any extra juice!

I've never reviewed a recipe before, but I feel compelled to review this. It's amazing! amazingly simple, amazingly fresh, and amazingly delicious! I've made it a few times now, most recently with canned tomatoes and dried basil because that was what I had on hand, and it was still just as yummy as when it's made with fresh ingredients. Makes me LOVE to cook!

Since I had frozen cooked salad shrimp on hand that I wanted to use, I approached this differently. First sauteed garlic in butter (only 2 tblsp) for 1 min, then added the tomatoes. No fresh basil, so went with the stuff in the tube. Fresh would have been so much better.  After that added a little olive oil and a few ladles of the pasta water, then the thawed, cooked shrimp. Very good with a red blend wine on a very cold late fall day!

Outstanding!   Prepared for company; everyone raved and wanted the recipe. Did cut the butter down and halved the garlic because of personal preferences, but it certainly didn’t diminish the taste. Also grated Asiago cheese over top.  Highly recommend.

Followed the recipe exactly, except I replaced the tomato with mushrooms as I didn't have any tomatoes and forgot to add the oil. Even my picky 4 y/o loved it. He kept saying how good it was and that he was so glad I made this. Can't get any higher praise than that!

The flavor was great but I didn't use as much butter as it called for. Also I used a full pound of pasta and doubled everything but I think I should have included 4x everything to accommodate all the pasta. Will keep this in mind for another time!
