I received this same recipe from a friend last year, only we used soda crackers and it was delicious. Everyone loved it.

So easy to make! Especially good with graham crackers: you can line them up easier in the pan and don't have to overlap them.

I have also made this using saltines instead, and it's hard to keep these around.  They are now one of my favorite treats.  I haven't met anyone yet who doesn't think they're outstanding!!

I have made this brittle before using primium plus soda crackers,  Loved it, the sweet and saltly flavs are a great mix.  Ensure to cook long enough on the stove and not to long in the oven.

I just tried this and it is fantastic! However I have changed it up a bit and used saltines, milk chocolate chips and added sliced toasted almonds to the top.  It is definitely something that keeps you coming back for more. CRACK is a good way of describing it, znd you will become addicted too!!

I accidentally grabbed a box of honey wafers instead of the graham crackers I was going to use.  To combat the sweetness I knew the dessert would have, once I poured my caramel on the crackers I sprinkled fresh cracked sea salt over everything, then popped it in the oven.  I liked the idea of the saltines, but I wanted a better quality base than that.  I think salted caramel is the answer folks!

I made this using 1 1/2 C both brown sugar and butter for extra toffee to cover crackers nicely because 1C recipe was a little thinner than I preferred. Also used white chocolate chips and holiday sugar to decorate for holiday season. My family loves this recipe!

I had a ton of pretzel crackers to use up and it was a perfect mix of sweet & salty. I only had sunflower seeds so those got sprinkled on as well.
