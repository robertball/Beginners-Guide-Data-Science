This was a really good recipe. I added a slight more ginger and garlic to make it a little more "Asian." I live in Japan and brought them to a party and everyone said they were delicious and as good (or better) as restaurant gyoza/potstickers.

For the sauce, I'd advise against plum sauce. The potstickers are pretty flavorful and plum sauce would be a bit overpowering I think. I used ponzu sauce (available in Asian markets) but a bit of vinegar and soy sauce mixed together would work nicely too.

I will definitely make again, a very easy recipe.
