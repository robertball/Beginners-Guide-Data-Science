Perfect and tender matzoh balls. Simple to put together and moist consistency. As the submitter recommended, DO NOT let the balls soak in the soup. They will fall apart and make a less than appealing soup. The last time I made these I added a bit of chicken cracklings for a richer flavor and that was tasty too. Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe Weekend Cook!

I followed the recipe to a "T" and the result was perfectly moist and tender matzoh balls. Previous attempts using other recipes were edible, but not good. Another user said these would fall apart if left in the soup. Mine held together for three days just fine. This is now my "go to" recipe. Thanks for sharing it!

YOU must loosley form your matzah balls. Mine came out way too firm and I did not understand why. So, I looked up on a different site that you can not compact you matzah balls too much or they will be too firm. That had a negative impact on the flavor and fluffiness.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe, but I wanted to say this is very forgiving. I used a food processor to grind the last half of a box of matzo at the end of Passover and halved the recipe, and the balls came out great!
