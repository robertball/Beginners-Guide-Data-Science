I made this recipe to a tee & found it to be quite bland.  After adding some much needed salt & then throwing in some frozen meatballs I had in the freezer, I found this recipe to be very good.  So, have saved the recipe & will make it again with needed alterations for my taste.

I used elbow macaroni because I had it on hand. The soup came out more like a stew, which was absolutely fine with me. It was thick and very flavorful. This was the best dish that I have made in quite some time! It is a new family favorite!

I was looking for a recipe to use up some zucchini as well as some other items I had in my refrigerator and this one fit the bill. Its a very basic recipe and easy to adapt. I added quite a bit of other items and cooked everything until it was soft then I used my blender to cream it. It was a huge hit. Everyone loved it.
