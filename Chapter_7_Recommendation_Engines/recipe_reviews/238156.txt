As written, this recipe is a solid 4 stars, and with tweaks it's a 5. I found 4oz of feta to be way too much, so I started out with about 1/2 of the package and that was a good amount for our liking.  Also, 1 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of pepper is A LOT, especially given all the salt from the feta. I used 1/2 tsp of each and that was plenty.  I happened to have fresh dill on hand, so I used that instead of dried. Very tasty! I also think this could benefit from an extra tomato, but still a great recipe overall.  This is great to bring to a BBQ or to serve to guests. Thanks for the recipe Elizabeth!

Great recipe. I add roasted eggplant slices, cut in strips to the ingredients, parsley, thyme and basil to the herbs. Delicious!

I found this to have a weird aftertaste. Not sure I'd make this again.

I love the dressing and made a few changes because  I had left over quinoa and chick peas from another recipe and I wanted more veg., as I'm watching my weight.  It made two large servings for dinner of 530 calories each.
1 1/2 cups cooked quinoa
1cup chick peas, drained and rinsed
1.2 oz Julian carrot
1/2 oz red onion, sliced thin
5 oz cucumber, sliced thin
2 oz Feta cheese
4 oz Cherry tomato, halved

Dressing:
1Tbs. Olive Oil
1Tbs. Lemon Juice, fresh
1/4 - 1/2 tsp. Salt
1/2 tsp. Pepper
1tsp. Dill weed, dried
1Tbs. Cider Vinegar

I really like the Feta in the recipe. The flavor needs a little tweaking, but it was still very good!

Made twice now. Second time used vegetable broth instead of water and doubled the liquid for the dressing. On my third attempt will use half red quinoa and half white.

I didn't have feta, so I added extra tomato and cucumber. I used a fraction of the salt it called for and it tasted great.

I tweaked the recipe too.  I didn't have any pure vinegar so used half the amount of balsamic vinegar.  I added garbanzo beans and didn't use much salt.  It makes a great lunch if you're on the go.

I was very disappointed by this recipe. I followed it to the letter and it was incredibly salty! Inedibly so. If I was to ever make this again, I wouldnâ€™t add any salt.

I didn't have tomatoes so I added red peppers for the color and I didn't add the salt, I usually don't add salt to anything anyway. I will be making this again for sure, It is great for lunch and I am sure it is just as great as a side to anything :) Thank you for the recipe!

I loved it!  I'm not fond of dill, so I substituted fresh oregano and it was delicious.  It has quickly become a family favorite!

This turned out excellently! I used more dressing, because I love lemon. I also added (give or take) a half teaspoon of chilli powder which went over very well! I doubled the recipe as I was feeding 9 people, and it was plenty with some sausages and buns.

Love it.  Great for lunch with some chicken.  I do like my Quinoa more al-dente and more flavorful, so I prepare my quinoa with 1-1/4 cups of chicken broth.

Generally good and easy to make  but I think next time I would add a little more dressing.  It was just a bit bland tasting.

Super quick and a great side dish.  I used grape tomatoes and quartered cucumber slices and it turned out just fine.  This will be a summer staple!

Make sure you rinse the quinoa very well before cooking it.  I used a combination of red & white quinoa and it was very tasty.  I double the quantity so we have plenty for lunch, snacks, side dish, etc.  This has become a staple in my house.

I've made this about 5 times this summer. We all love it!  I use parsley instead of dill because that's what I usually have. It needs time in the fridge for the flavor to develop. Great recipe!
