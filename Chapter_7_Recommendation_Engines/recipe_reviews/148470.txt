My kids really like this salad.  I do add a little finely chopped red onion, and if the shredded cheddar cheese is on sale I do use that, (not a big deal to swap out for the cubed cheese) and sometimes to save time I also use a bottled salad dressing.  My youngest daughter really likes this with bacon ranch salad dressing!!!

I used macaroni, 2 tbs. ranch dressing, and equal parts olive oil mayo and reduced fat sour cream and omitted the oil for the sauce base for this recipe.  I did NOT add SALT because the HAM has plenty.  I substituted white pepper and a dash of cayenne for the black pepper.    YUM!  It's dishes like this that I end up eating most of and NOT taking for a pot luck.

This was a good salad, although on the dry side.  There's really not much to the dressing. I could see the benefit of using a bottled salad dressing (I like the idea of the bacon ranch!).  We did enjoy it and it's very light.

This is a great basic pasta salad!  Although, I did omit the oil and lemon juice.  I also did not add salt as there would be plenty of salt from the ham.  Other than that, it was delicious!

Everyone in my family enjoyed this recipe. The second time I made it with ring pasta, and we liked that even better than the shells. I used shredded cheese for the convenience.

This was a nice base. I didn't have any peas so I used green onions for color and added chopped hard boiled egg.I didn't measure any ingredients but I know I used a ton more mayo than called for.

This was super simple and the flavors get better the longer it sits. I personally thought it needed a little more lemon juice to help phase out the mayo flavor but like I said it got better if you let the flavors mix.

This is terrific!!  I substituted a shallot for the onion, olivie oil instead of vegetable, and used two ham steaks cut into tiny pieces.  I also omitted the salt.  I did have to add a little more mayo, but it is one of the best recipes ever!

This is the foundation for a good pasta salad. I added cayenne pepper, paprika, Cole slaw dressing and some ranch dressing as well as a wee bit of bacon fat instead of the oil. I think you could omit the cheese or shred  it as other reviewers mentioned. Onion is a must. I added these items as it started out too dry ( not enough dressing) and bland. Would make again, but as mentioned, as the base for the salad.

This was very good! I stirred together the dressing first and then added the ham, cheese, and veggies. I used an entire 12 oz. package of peas and 2TB onion. I left all other measurements the same. I rinsed my pasta with cold water and added it last, but I think next time I'll add them first to make sure they get good and coated with the dressing. I may add 50% more dressing, but it really was wonderful as is written. Very tasty!

I’m eating this now. It’s really good! It’s great to use up the small amounts of pastas I have left from other dishes. Mine has elbows and shells. Frozen Peas went into the pot a few minutes after the pasta. Thanks to another reviewer, I used white pepper and a dash of cayenne, skipped the cheese.

I find this is very good because I cook for someone with dysphagia. His gullet is about half its normal size because of surgery after a fall. The only change I made was to shred the pasta, cheese and ham. Chunks of anything just don't work, but the basic composition is fine.

Easy main course salad to make in advance for an anticipated busy evening; added cauliflower to pasta pot to increase vegetable servings. Did not use the oil, but did add cucumber Ranch to the mix. Also used McCormick Salad Supreme to amp up the flavor. Have made multiple times usually using the frozen peas and carrots. Very flexible as different cheeses work well. Easy and tasty. Great as leftovers too.

Rather average, in fact rather ho-hum.  Doctored it up with some dry ranch seasoning and some celery for crunch. It was dry,  even with the touch of oil - added a little mayo, some sour cream and a touch of half-and-half.  Just ok - nothing anybody would remember let alone ask the recipe for, but it worked in a pinch for something to serve with our burgers.

Used one green onion (not an onion fan); omitted salt and other seasonings. Made dressing with 3Tbsp. Miracle Whip + 2 Tbsp. Kraft Sun Dried Tomato & Red Pepper dressing. Added more dressing to make it moister. Very delicious!

Delicious and easy to make. I made it according to the directions except I omitted the salt. I used avocado oil for the vegetable oil. It can be enjoyed warm, room temperature or cold. Make s a wonderful summer light main dish or side salad. I will definitely make this often.

This is the flavor I was looking for.  The lemon juice was a bit much so I added some sugar to tone it down.  Next time I'm going to leave it out.  I would have liked more dressing, so maybe do another 1/2 recipe of those ingredients.

Great for a basic recipe. Super easy to make. I did find I needed more mayo so it wasn't as dry. Don't skip the lemon juice! I forgot it the first time and it was quite bland.

Made with the ranch dressing added 16 oz. bag of California blend frozen veggies that was a definite plus! used shredded cheese only cause that was what I had. don't  skimp on the dressing. I made on Thursday and served on Friday I think it's better with more time in the fridge. There is room to play with this recipe and make it to your flavor favorites. Will definitely make again.

Just delish!!!! The peas really make this a unique and tasty pasta salad.  My son doesn't like peas (so he thinks) and eats them in here. You can use fresh, canned or thawed frozen. The blend of ingredients are a very good combination, warm or cold. I'm a spice queen and needed to add seasoned salt and celery salt along with the regular salt and pepper.

This was great. Whipped up really fast too.  I did use Ditalina pasta, chopped green onions and shredded cheddar cheese because that's what I had on hand. Also didn't add to oil to save a few calories. Definitely will make this again..

I'm just making this so the jury is still out but I had more pasta and ham then the recipe called for so it was looking pretty dry. I added 2 tablespoons of ranch dressing then added 2tabls more plus 2 tablespoons of Marie callendars BBQ cole slaw to add some zing.  We'll see. .
