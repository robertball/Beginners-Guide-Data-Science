Quick and easy to make! I made this with my kids - they love to make these super special desserts! The started of with stirring the pudding until it thickened, then spooning some crumbs into their cups, taking turns spooning pudding in...the whole recipe ended up being such a fun activity that we all enjoyed! I love these types of recipes - and so do my kids!

A rating of 10 from 4 little girls! Loved that these were made with all low or no fat ingredients. The kids and their friends loved em'. A nice treat thats not so bad for you. Next time I will remember the gummy worms for a more "spooky" look. Thanks!
