These are great with some changes.  I added half a cup of unsweetened shredded coconut, a teaspoon of vanilla, 2 full cups of flour (1/2 a cup of that was whole wheat), 2 cups of diced mango, and milk instead of cream.  Great for breakfast with coffee!!

I tried making it using only one mango (probably 1.5 to 2 cups after dicing it finely), and I feel like it would have been better to use two.  I'm used to using only 1 egg for a batch of muffins, so I was surprised to see that this recipe called for 3.  However, I used 3 anyway, and I'm glad I did because that gave the muffins a nice cake-like texture.  These are not excessively sweet like the muffins you buy in the store, so if you want something sweeter, you may want to double the sugar, but for those who want something healthier, you could probably omit the sugar entirely and use low-fat or skim milk in place of the heavy cream.

I will definitely make these again.  Very moist, semi-sweet muffin.  I like that this recipe is very flavorful without overdoing the amount of sugar and butter.  Using ripe mangos gives you all the sweetness needed.

3 cups of mango seems too much & out of the proportion to the flour.

Followed the recipes exactly and got beautiful results. I love that the sweetness of the mango is the star feature. Most recipes call for too much sugar. A little almond extract would up the mango flavor I think.

These muffins are moist and flavorful! Based on other reviews, I made the following changes. I used 2 1/2 cups of mango, 1 tsp. vanilla and substituted milk for cream since I never buy cream. Instead of folding the mango into the batter, I added the mango and used the mixer to blend the mango flavor throughout.

While they were baking, I checked the muffins a few times because I didn't want them to dry out from baking too long. What I found with my oven was that baking for 22 minutes was perfect. I will definitely make these again!

After cooking for nearly an hour the muffins are still really wet. 2 cups of flour and two mangoes next time. Kids judged it to be a little tart so more sugar also

I followed the recipe exactly and found the muffins to be heavy. I think it should read three mangoes instead of three cups. Three cups was way to much.  It also seemed to be a bit bland. Maybe some type of extract to give it some zip.

These muffins were fantastic!  I made them for snack at my daughter's school and the kids all raved and requested them for next snack day.  Even the picky kids liked them.  They're moist and very tasty.  This is a keeper!

Maybe it was because I used frozen mango pieces (thawed), but I found these didn't have much flavour at all. Disappointed.

This was a super moist muffin that showcased the mango. I was looking for something that didn t have coconut and this fit the bill. Super yummy with an afternoon cup of tea.

I will make it again following the directions exactly next time. I had some mangoes I wanted to use but ended up eating them all before I got around to making this recipe. But I really wanted muffins to take to a beach breakfast picnic. So I pur√©ed a mix of frozen mangos and frozen peaches that I had in the freezer. Then I realized I was out of flour so I used some white wholewheat flour that I bought on accident a couple months ago. And I used milk instead of cream and added a teaspoon of vanilla to the mix because I was worried it would be to tart. I don't know if that actually did anything. Muffins ended up super moist super delicious. Almost like a cupcake. I think I'm gonna end up liking it with whole wheat flour maybe substitute 1/2 cup flour for some oatmeal and then add in some macadamia nuts to give it that hearty breakfast muffin goodness. But I want to try the recipe exactly as written before I make any other changes.

Great!  Made it with modifications, some as recommended by other reviewers, and it is moist and flavor is subtle, not too sweet, exactly the way we like it.  

Modifications:
1) Used 2 cups -not 3-of Bob's 1 to 1 gluten-free baking flour
2) Used 2 cups -not 3-mango
3) Used whole milk, didn't have whipped heavy cream
4) 1 tsp vanilla
5) Baked 35 min - 25 min muffins were still uncooked inside
