This has been my mom's exact cranberry combo for years and after making it dozens of times my only advice would be to finely chop the walnuts, and its important to drain the pineapple or the citrus acidity is too harsh. This is really quick and simple to make, great change from traditional and a hit at holiday gatherings.  People who don't normally care for cranberry give it a taste and most often fall in love.  Gwynn, I was gonna post this one but you beat me to it!  Enjoy as will we!

I actually have made a slightly different version of this recipe including 2 cans of 10oz mandarin oranges. I make this every year for Thanksgiving instead of plain cranberry.  It can also be put on top of cheesecake for dessert!

I made this for Thanksgiving this year. We had 5 families over. Everyone LOVED it! Almost everyone wanted to know how I made it. I did not alter the recipe. I placed the crushed pineapple in a small-holed colander and pressed it with a large spoon to get out all the juice. I did the same thing with the frozen strawberries that I had already thawed (after I cut them to smaller pieces). I would have liked to have used fresh strawberries, but they are too expensive at this time of the year where I live. I was pleasantly surprised that this dish remained fresh (in a sealed container) for at least three days after Thanksgiving. I plan to make this a traditional side dish for my upcoming annual Thanksgiving meals.

This recipe was very easy but full of flavor.  Served it for Thanksgiving and everyone just loved it.  Even my father in law who doesn't like to break from the traditional cranberry sauce couldn't stop eating it. Serve it in a crystal bowl to make it look extra special!  I will be making this again. Thank you for sharing!

This was a HIT with my Easter ham!  Delish.
This recipe makes a LOT, so I cut it in half using- 8 oz. pineapple, 1 can cranberry sauce, 1/4 cup walnuts, 10 oz. strawberries.

I will absolutely make this for Thanksgiving too!

I've made this relish twice and will make it often.  I've served it with pork and with turkey.  Even my 6 year old loves it.

Flavorful and delicious. A great twist to the plain old jellied cranberry sauce! It is key to drain the pineapple, and I added a few extra walnuts because I liked the crunch. This went over well at Christmas!

Really good...I don't usually like the more traditional recipes.  This one really cuts the tartness of the berries, few changes (omitted nuts & added 1/4 tsp grated ginger)  This will become a standard in my holiday file.  Thanks!

When I put this out on the table for Thanksgiving, everyone groaned.  They are very partial to the gelatinous can shaped slices we have had at previous thanksgiving diners.  Well no more - Everyone loved it! Many of my family members even asked to take some home with their leftovers! The pineapple is the key and the nuts add a wonderful crunch!

This was great.  I did make a few changes to add extra flavor.  I put in juice of 1/2 small lemon and juice of a small mandarin orange and I added some dried cranberries..  Without the added citrus the relish would have been good but not great.

Variation:  Omit strawberries and walnuts.  Add the zest of 1 orange.    Tip: Slightly heat  the canned cranberry sauce to loosen its gelatin before stirring in the pineapple, etc.    I usually like to make fresh cranberry relish from scratch with apples, oranges, and cranberries in a food processor, with a can of crushed pineapple stirred in, and some sugar.  So delicious.  But yesterday, I was very short on time, so I threw together 2 cans of whole berry cranberry sauce and 1 can of crushed pineapple, then added a little orange zest.  I was surprised how delicious it tasted, and so much easier than the fresh relish.

This is quick, simple and a huge hit with my family.  It is something they always ask to make sure I am fixing for thanksgiving.  The only difference is that I don't put the strawberries in it and I use about 3/4 cup of walnuts.  They won't even eat the regular cranberry sauce any more!

My mother in law makes something similar to this...very tasty but I can't really eat it much because I'm diabetic. FYI, this probably shouldn't be in the diabetic section, wayyyy too many carbs for a diabetic like me.

Made this for Thanksgiving. So simple and good. Was a hit with everyone even my husband who doesn't care for cranberries. My teenage nephew called it "the bomb" and wanted what was left over to take home (which wasn't much) Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I love cranberry relish; but it is typically too tart for the kids.  I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  All the kids had seconds and all the adults asked for the recipe.

So easy and so delicious!  I've made this for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners for the last few years.  It is becoming a tradition in my family and everyone looks forward to it now.  The flavors are definitely better the second day, so be sure to make it the day before you plan to serve it.  I make it exactly per the recipe.

I was in a pinch and did not have access to fresh cranberries, so  I made this and everyone thought it was fantastic.  I only had time for it to sit in the refrigerator  for 5 hours.  I took it to a potluck and the dish was empty when I came home.

We enjoyed this relish very much.  It's just what I was looking for on Thanksgiving.  I didn't have strawberries on hand and it was still delicious.  It goes with any meat.  I will add strawberries next time.  And what could be easier to prepare.  Thanks for posting it.   It's A Keeper.

I love this.  Followed recipe after implementing some of the reviews. I don't remember anyone mentioning it but even though this is not the time of year for good strawberries, I used whole, frozon strawberries with NO SUGER added.  It was still sweet enough. Being diabetic, I didn't want the sugar.  I took it to a pot luck at church and it was a hit.  Everyone wanted to know what was in it.  I thought it was even better the next day.

I have used this for the past 2 years and it always turns out perfect. Quick and easy. Even folks who do not care for cranberry sauce will eat this and ask for more. I do not alter this recipe in any way.

This is without a doubt the best relish/desert I have ever prepared. I have shared it with many in the campground and all wanted the recipe. Better than cake, cookies or pie and so easy to prepare. I add extra strawberries without draining as we like the juice. Also can use frozen strawberries in the bag, just cut them in half. Cuts down on the calories.   Sharon
