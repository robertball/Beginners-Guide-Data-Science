This recipe needs a LOT of modification to even resemble decent tabouli.  It has way too much bulgar wheat, not nearly enough parsley, it doesn't say to rinse the bulgar, and if you add it all in w/ the boiling water you end up cooking your herbs.   If you do make and modify it, add diced/seeded cucumbers and tomatoes.

Very tasty, and not overly lemony IMO (though I do adore citrus).  Because some of the previous reviews complained about how long it took for the bulgur to soak, I microwaved the mixture for a minute on high before letting it sit, and it turned out just fine after 30 minutes.  I also increased the parsley to a full 2 cups, and also added some chopped tomato and cucumber for a bit extra chunkiness.  Definitely a keeper.

Thanks, Twinkeroo, great suggestions!  I increased parsley to 2 cups and added tomoto and cucumber.  Also added some scallions.  Used full about of lemon juice and zest and loved it!  This was my first attempt at making my own tabouli and would recommend letting salad refrigerate overnight before serving to let flavors really come out.  Yum!!

The ingredients are a good start; the proportions didn't seem right to me.  For me, this dishes main ingredient should be parsley.  So, 1 cup bulgur, 2 bunches parsley, 1/2 bunch mint.  Next time I would do even less bulgur.  LOTS of salt and pepper; pinches are NOT ENOUGH!  With my changes is GREAT and would make again.

This recipe is like the one I first tasted years ago when I spent some time in Lebanon. Whenever I go to a Lebanese restaurant I always check the Tabouli but none can compare with the tangy goodness I first had. It's the quality and quantity of lemon that makes the difference between just so-so and great. This one comes close.

I was disapointed with this recipe.  The flavors sound good but the instructions are off.  I started making this at 4pm and it's now 5:40pm and the water has still not soaked into the bulgar.  I've taken it to the microwave trying to save it but I think it's a goner. :(  Normally the ratio of water to bulgar is 1 1/2 cups water to 1 cup bulgar and you boil water then add bulgar then simmer for 15 minutes.  I'll do this next time if i try it again.

Having only tried tabouli at our Armenian restaurant, this was definitely NOT what I expected, having no tomatoes or onions and a minimal amount of parsley.  It was quite tasty, though.  Because of the other reviews of way too much lemon, I left out the zest and only used the juice.  It wasn't lemony at all.  It was really good, though and will be a nice addition to our summer salad recipe rotation.  Next time, I'll add a few veggies (cucumbers, bell peppers, tomatoes, etc.) and more parsley and mint, but thanks for a yummy, different recipe!

It definitely took much, much longer to soak up the water - more like 60 minutes. The bulgur still had a tough consistency and was pretty much inedible due to its lack of flavor, of which only lemon was apparent.

This was my first attempt at tabouli and I think it turned out great!  I left out the parsley and just added more mint.  I also used less than 4 cups for a water and it still took longer than 30 minutes to soak it up.  Beware, this makes A LOT!  I've been eating leftovers for lunch all week.  If you're not absolutely crazy about lemon, cut it back a bit, as it turns out VERY lemony.

Great base, but like many others, I added more parsley (2 heaping cups), mint (1 heaping cup), plus diced persian cucumbers and tomatoes. Delicious!

This was excellent after making some modifications.  A used 1 1/4 Cups (uncooked) Couscous and increased the Parsley to 1 Cup.  I also added 1 medium sized finely diced tomato and 1/2 of a medium sized chopped and seeded Cucumber and some chopped Green Onions.

After reading the suggestions, I decreased the lemon zest to 1 lemon and increased the mint and parsley to 1/2 c. I also added three green onions and 1 c. tomatoes chopped.  
It went very well with the Carrots with dill butter and Almond topped fish.

I made it with just one large cup of bulgar and a lot more parsley than the recipe asks for. I also added tomato. Delicious :)

This is to be a "parsley" salad so the ratio of parsley to grain is much higher. It is important also to "cut" thinly the Parsley, never to chop it. / after the bulgur is in hot wáter for 15 minutes you have to drain it and set aside, and after the mix is cooled down is that you add the other ingredients/- The salad needs to rest longer tan 30 minutes, and last  with good flavor 3 days in the fridge. there are defined steps to this récipe; step 1 needs clarification and order.

I leave the mint out of this because I just don't like it. And I also add chopped garlic and salt and pepper.  Otherwise, it's tasteless.

I love lots of lemon on mine, and I like a lot of parsley and fresh mint. I also add tomato and cucumber, as one reviewer suggested. Sometimes I make it with Israeli couscous. Occasionally, rice is nice, or an addition of lentils to whatever grain/pasta you are using. It's always good!
