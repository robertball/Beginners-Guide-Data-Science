Didn't use jalape√±os and used all dry spices and it turned out really good.  I used this in a chicken salad and seasoned the chicken with lemon pepper, really flavorful.

I used this to dress a Mediterranean pasta salad (penne, kalmata olives, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, spinach, feta cheese, roasted pine nuts, grilled chicken). It was fabulous!

The dressing was light and overall okay. The whole thing tasted like raw onion though. I was hoping the vinegar would calm it down but it didn't. I had to add extra orange juice and vinegar to calm down the harshness of the onion. I've also microwaved it and am currently letting it sit hoping the onion cooked a little. Wouldn't make again. Sorry.
