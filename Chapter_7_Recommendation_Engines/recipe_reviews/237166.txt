This is so yummy!
Used onion soup mix with beef broth since I didn't have beef  consomm√©.
Made mash potatoes and ended up eating the carrots too!
Definitely a keeper in our house.

This was delicious. Hubby wound up adding potatoes to the crock pot and ate them along with the other vegtables. I followed the suggestion and ate it on a hoagie roll. Super tender and very tasty.

Very pleased with the outcome of this recipe.  I did not have any consomme but instead subbed 1 3/4 cup water and 1/4 marsala wine and added a beef bullion cube (for 2 cups).  As per another reviewer added some dried thyme and bay leaves.  Served on hoagie rolls and dipped into the broth. Next time I will chill the broth to skim some of the fat off and reheat. Also thinking for next time to serve maybe with melted cheese and sauted mushrooms as a sandwich.

We added some herbs and other ingredients to add more flavor. We served it with the vegetables like a stew. it was great.

These beef short ribs came out delicious.  I made sure to use my large slow cooker so that I could put the ribs in single file.  My only hope is that I can find these ribs again as they are far and few between, if at all!

These are great--even leftover! I didn't have any 
beef consume so I used some beef base--it worked well (water as listed +beef base 2 tsp -- no extra liquid). Added a couple of bay leaves and a small squeeze of anchovy paste -- to up the savory ness.

The short ribs came out marvelous and this is a super easy recipe.  My tweaks: 1.  I put the meat and juice in the over to brown it a little on top (because my crew likes it well done and it burned off a little fat).  2.  I took the rest and added a few of the bones, a package of barley, a little salt, Worcester and red wine and some dehydrated mushrooms and ended up with an amazing barley soup!

Great recipe but I seasoned the ribs, drenched in flour and browned them before placing them in the crockpot. Kept them whole to serve with gravy and the vegetables!  Very tasty!

Made it and was really good. Used onion soup and threw in a few small potatoes.  Served with flavored rice and hush puppies.  Baby carrots were edible also.
