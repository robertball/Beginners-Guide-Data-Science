This is a good basic recipe but I think it needs a little revamp. Here is the revamping I did....

I used 1 cup of Half and Half instead of 2 cups of milk (too soggy with that much milk)

I used 6 eggs instead of 4 for a richer egg texture.

I added 3 tbsns green onions to the milk/egg mixture.

I used 6 slices of THICK texas toast and covered the bottom of the pan with it. I then put the cooked sausage over that. (Bob Evans Spicy Hot Sausage from Kroger) I then put 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese over that. Then I pour the egg/half and half/green onion mixture over that.

I bake after letting it sit in the fridge for 8-12 hours at 350 degree for 25 minutes.

I guess I should post a new recipe!!

This is the BEST breakfast casserole ever!  I have made it several times for Christmas. This past weekend was my daughters high school prom and our house ended up being the "after party".  I put out a spread for them including this casserole.  The kids raved about it! My daughters bf asked me when I was going to make it again! So...I will be making it again this weekend! LOL! I do make a few changes that I have picked up on here. I use the Jimmy Dean Maple Sausage, 6 eggs (I think I am going to try 8 next time), 1 1/2 Cups milk (I think I am going to try the full 2 Cups next time), I don't think I am going to use additional salt next time b/c I feel it is salty enough from the sausage and cheese. I use the mild cheddar, but I use 1 box of Marie Callendar Cheddar/Garlic croutons instead of the bread and that adds to the cheesy flavor. And I add a little bit more of the dried mustard. It is an excellent breakfast casserole!

This dish is absolutely delicious!  I doubled the recipe using 3 bags of Marie Callendar's Cheese & Garlic Croutons instead of plain bread, 20 eggs, 1/2 cup sliced scallions, 1/2 cup chopped onion, 6 cups of milk, 2 teaspoons mustard powder, 1 teaspoon black pepper, 2 teaspoons of salt and 1 pound each of Monterrey Jack and Mild Cheddar Cheese.  I put shredded cheese on the top of it in the last 15 minutes of baking.  I made this recipe for a Holiday Brunch at my place of employment and it won a prize for "Best Breakfast Casserole"!  Thank  you M.K. Meredith for this fantastic recipe!

So tasty, so easy, so great!!  I've made this three times (for a houseful of company each time), and it's always a hit. (It's also really nice to be able to visit in the morning instead of standing at the stove.) These are generous servings, and thank goodness - everyone goes for seconds!  I've tried the half regular/half sage sausage combo as suggested, but my favorite is to just use Jimmy Dean Maple flavor sausage - HEAVENLY. This is my go-to recipe to impress for breakfast or brunch!

This was really pretty good.  I am not a big egg person but this I would eat again.  

I'd bought the wrong type of sausage... so I figured I'd just squeeze it out of the casing to brown, then when I went to do that I found out it was PRECOOKED!  Not a problem at all.  I just popped the precooked (beef) sausage into my Ultimate Chopper and gave it a few zaps, saved a ton of time and mess!  

I had this thing whipped together in just a few minutes.  I did increase the bread to 8 slices, cheese to 3 cups and reduced the milk to 1 cup...didn't want to take any chances of anything being "runny or slimey".  Added a chopped onion according to other suggestions.  The 8 slices of bread may have been a bit much for some... it was pretty thick but I think I'll stick with it as it turned out so well.  Nothing worse than slimey eggs!  

Oh and I had put this in my lazagna pan, so cut the servings the way I would a lazagna.  The left overs I wrapped in the Press-n-Seal wrap in single serving sizes and put them in the freezer.  The next morning we just popped one in the microwave for 1 minute, turned out just as good as the first day.  Would be good to do a pan of this up and cut the whole thing up in single serve slices to freeze for those need a good breakfast quick mornings.

This is wonderful on a cold December morning especially at Christmas.  The bread does not have to be toasted or cut up. You can just cut the crusts off and make one layer on the bottom of the baking dish and pour the egg mixture over it. I sometimes saute chopped onion with the sausage, also have added mushrooms.  I always serve with side of picante and sour cream, but not necessary.

I prepared this Christmas eve with a few changes from others. I made this with 6 eggs, maple sausage. I used 1/2 cup croutons & 6 slices of toated bread. Added about 2 teaspoons green chili's for enough zip & not a lot of hot so my children would eat this. I agree 9x13 makes this to thin. I used a 11x7 & will use a 8x8 or 10x10 next year. This was Wonderful, A NO fail recipe. Pop in the oven while family is opening presents or make this for anytime of year. To good to only make once a year!

I have made this for several years now and update my review accordingly.  I used to make various changes, but honestly, the original recipe is the best.  I doubled the recipe, and as the author suggested, I used 1 lb breakfast sausage and 1 lb sage.  Didn't have mustard powder so used yellow mustard.  I also used whole milk and added hredded potatoes.  By accident, I didn't toast the bread.  I am so glad I didn't because this turned out this was the most moist and fluffy this casserole has ever been.  If you fear this will be dry, do NOT toast the bread first.  I love this recipe and it is a Christmas morning tradition for us now.  And, don't you just love that people "tweak" recipes until they are unrecognizable and then give the original recipe low stars?

A huge hit on Christmas morning, and special brunches at our house! Very hearty, and works just as well with 12 ounces of the reduced fat sausage in place of the pound of regular sausage. Be sure to0 LET IT SET OVERNIGHT!!!! Once we were pressed for time and we just mixed it and popped it in the oven, and it was mush! Follow the directions and you will love this!  Try extra sharp cheddar, too!

This is a very good recipe, very much like one I've made for a few years.  For a little bit more flavor try this: substitute sourdough bread for the white bread, add 1 can (or to your taste) of ortega chiles, and substitute 1/2 of the cheddar for jack cheese.  Gives it a bit of a southwestern zing and it's really good.

Good recipe.  One addition I tried last weekend was to use hash browns instead of bread.  Really folks, it was amazing and took it to the next level.  Give it a try!  Otherwise, good recipe as is.

Didn't much care for some of the aspects of this particular recipe, but love it with my changes. I use 1 tsp of seasoning salt omitting the salt, saute a chopped onion in with the sausage, use 8 eggs and don't toast the bread. I have both cubed the bread and just placed the slices in the pan, either have done well. I put it together as following: spray the pan, place bread cubes in pan, then place the cooked sausage and onions, then the cheese, then the egg mixture. I cover tightly with foil, take out of the fridge 30 min prior to baking, as the oven preheats. Hope that this helps. Have been making this for years.

This was easy and great tasting, I used other reviewers ideas and used Jimmy Dean Maple sauagage, and I did not layer the bread.  But I will double the recipe next time for the 9 x 13 pan, it was not thick enough.    I will add more egg but not more sausage.  I will make this again, Thanks -

I have tried this recipe twice.  The first time didn't come out too well.  The first time I used maple sausage and italian croutons and it just ok.  This time I tried Sage Sausage and white bread.  It came out absolutely amazing! Thank you for the great recipe and helpful reviews. So here's exactly what I did: 
- use white bread, cubed up (not toasted)
- use Sage Sausage
- 6 eggs
- 1 scallion diced and sauteed in pan before sausage, then with sausage
- used extra sharp cheddar cheese
- don't go too crazy with cheese or will come out greasy
- layered it: bread, sausage & scallion, cheese, then egg mix (then more cheese on top)
- cover with foil in fridge overnight
- take out of fridge 30 min before cooking to bring back to room temp a little 
* Hope this helped.  Oh and I def recommend doubling the recipe since it goes fast since it's so good.

This one's been in our family for 25 years or more and it's a hit every time I make it for family or guests. My recipe is 6 eggs and don't make it in the 9x13- comes out too flat. Make it in a 10x10 square casserole or 7x11. Use sharp or at least medium cheddar for flavor. I have so many requests for this one, I keep copies on hand.

This is by far the best casserole dish I have made, I make it around 5 or 6 times a year, always for special events at work and its always a HIT! a couple of suggestions:  if you like the texture more fluffier almost like a souffle (which is what I like) I do it with 8 cups of whole milk and I use a loaf of frozen garlic bread (no toasting) 2 lbs of sausage (1 lb of mild and 1 lb of spicy) a dozen eggs. or cut the amounts in half if its too much. I also sautee a whole yellow onion, it gives it the final touch. 1/2 lb of the cheese inside the mixture and the other half on top after the first stage of baking.

I've made this recipe as written and thought it was decent, but then I modified it.  I assembled the casserole on Christmas Eve and baked it off Christmas morning.  Following the advice of other reviewers, I lined the bottom of a 13x9 Pyrex with texas toast, which I ran under the broiler and lightly buttered.  I used 8 eggs, and half & half instead of milk.  I used maple sausage and added a little bit of crumbled maple bacon.  I also addeda  dash of garlic powder and chopped green onion into the milk mixture. With the bacon and sausage and cheese, no salt is needed. Letting it sit overnight worked well and cleanup on Christmas morning was so easy.  I loved it, and I thought my partner was going to go through the roof.  This is going to be our new Christmas morning tradition.

Why is this outstanding recipe "hiding" in the Christmas section? It should be used all year long for brunches and special occasion breakfasts! We loved this. I usually bake my own bread, but didn't happen to have any on had and didn't want to go to the store. I used a package of Marie Callendar's garlic parmesan croutons, increased the eggs and milk to compensate. Added some minced green onion, and crumbled sage flavored sausage. Wow what a breakfast treat! The flavors meld nicely and it had just the right amount of Pizazz for us. Thanks M.K.

Really wonderful.  My family cannot have wheat, so in order to make it gluten-free, I did have to change a few things. 

We substituted frozen hashbrowns (about 4 cups before cooking) for the bread, and I just saved the leftover grease from cooking the sausage and sauteed about a cup of chopped onions in it, then added the hashbrowns in until lightly crisped.  Since the hashbrowns wouldn't absorb the milk like the bread would, I used a can of evaporated milk instead.  Added in some garlic salt instead of the salt, and it cooked up wonderfully.  Artery-glogging goodness! My whole family raved about it.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

I made two of these casseroles, one mild and one spicy, for a Mother's Day brunch, intending them to  play second fiddle to pancakes and blueberry sauce.  However, they became the star of the show-- my family LOVED this casserole and all asked me how to make it.  My cousin who dislikes sausage even liked it.  I did make some changes, though:  (in each casserole) 1 cup half and half instead of milk, eight eggs instead of four, cheddar jack cheese, and a layer of garlic cheese croutons on the bottom instead of toasted bread.  For the mild casserole, I used maple sausage.  For the spicy casserole, I used hot sausage and added cayenne pepper and diced red and green bell pepper.  The men preferred the spicy, and the ladies seemed to like the sweeter casserole.  They both taste good to me!  I was worried about the bottom being soggy, but it's so good-- light and fluffy.  Thanks for the recipe.  Can't wait to use it for Christmas breakfast.  :)  UPDATE 12/25: True to my word, I made this for the family again for Christmas brunch.  Used sage sausage and a mix of garlic butter and cheese Texas Toast croutons and they gobbled it up once more.  So easy, so satisfying!

YUMMY! We all loved this recipe. Athough I have had to double the recipe because there never seems to be enough. I have also used plain croutons instead of the toasted bread and I thought it tasted even better! A good "special occasion" recipe or just a nice way to wake up on a cold Saturday morning.

This was great! I used 2.5 Cups of seasoned croutons instead of toasted bread.  Really yummy!! I'll definitely make this again!  Thanks for sharing.  =)

I added 1/2 lb more sausage, 2 more eggs and added more cheese on top and didn't sit overnight. I made it and cooked it same morning and only cooked it for 45 min and covered 1st half. It turned out fabulous.

Sooo good. I made this for christmas breakfast and everyone loved it. I'm not much of a cook, so I'm happy that I was able to make something that was easy and pleased everyone.  I used two more eggs like others suggested.  I doubled the recipe to serve nine people, but it wasn't quite enough. There wasn't even enough left over to serve seconds. Next time, I would tripple the recipe to feed  9 people if the casserole is all that I'm serving.

I followed most of original recipe but used 6 eggs (instead of 4), half-n-half (instead of milk), 1 tablespoon of prepared mustard (instead of ground mustard), and 9-grain bread (instead of white). Using 13X9" glass baking dish I layered bread first, then sausage, then cheese before adding egg mixture. Then I covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated overnight. The next morning I pulled out casserole before preheating oven (didn't want to plunge the Pyrex glassware into a hot oven). After removing plastic wrap, I baked at 350F for 25 min's, but I rotated the baking dish after 15 minutes. It looked terrific, all bubbly and set (see my photo)! It looked and sliced more like a savory french toast than like a quiche. If you want more of a quiche then add more eggs--as for me I'm good with my results! Will definitely make again!

I made this for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day and she loved it! Everyone else did as well. I used Hot Jimmy Dean's sausage, 6 eggs, and 1.5 cups fat free half and half. I also used a bag of Marie Callendar's Cheese and Garlic croutons instead of bread, cut the salt in half, and added a little extra mustard powder. I used a 9x11 pan and I agree with others that it was a little thin, but not too much so. 

I want to add too that I was a little concerned when I put this together the night before that it would be way too dry - it seemed like all croutons and no moisture. It was perfect though, so just ignore the fact that it looks a little weird when you're putting it together.

Like other reviewers, I use 6 eggs, and occasionally add chopped scallions, if I have them on hand. But honestly, this is a DELICIOUS egg casserole, and I make it all the time, due to popular demand.   I've made it a million times, and find it tastes the best if you chop up everything really fine (no big hunks of bread or sausage), and mix the cheese in throughout the bake.   And if you have an earthenware baking pan, you get a fantastic crust.

I've been making this recipe for years now, and everyone loves it!  It has become my Christmas morning tradition.  So easy to prepare the night before and pop in the oven while the kids open their presents.  I have always used 6 eggs instead of 4, and follow the rest of the recipe exactly!  Always comforting and tasty!  Thanks!

Super easy and delicious!  Easily doubled and a great thing to prepare the night before so you can enjoy a leisurely morning with your family or guests.  I used Pepperidge Farm seasoned croutons instead of sliced white bread - adds great flavor and makes the preparation even easier.  I also added two extra eggs, a small white onion, and used sharp cheddar instead of mild.

I changed this around a lot and it turned out wonderful.  I used 13 eggs, 1 pound of hot sausage, 1 pound of cheddar cheese, salt and pepper, and then baked it for one hour.

This was such a hit with my guests at my breakfast party this morning, and a huge hit with me!  Doubled the recipe, but used 18 eggs, and 2 cups of half n half instead of milk.  Put 2 1/2 bags of Texas Toast Garlic and Cheese Croutons on the bottom of a 9x13 pan.  Then cooked the 2 lbs Maple Sausage with chopped onions and put that layer.  Then a layer of cheddar cheese (I did half sharp/half mild), then the egg mixture.  45 minutes cooked covered at 350, then 20 minutes uncovered at 325.  I sprinkled a little more cheese on top when I uncovered it, for the last 20 min of cooking.  Filling, beautiful, tasty, addictive, and a great thing to make when you have to cook in bulk for a breakfast party!  I served with biscuits!  Thanks for this keeper of a recipe!

I made this recipe not having ever made any kind of breakfast casserole before. I was nervous b/c I was cooking for a crowd of 30+ college age adults! But in the end, the 3 pans we made were devoured within minutes. I even made a breakfast casserole lover out of my husband :) I used 6 eggs instead of 4 and hot sausage. Next time I will add more cheese and maybe try a different flavored sausage.

I've used this basic recipe for years, with one major change:  I use pre-baked potatoes, diced up with skins on, instead of the bread in the original recipe.  We love it!

This was a big hit with the family. I roughly one-and-a-halfed the recipe, which fit much better in a 9x13. I used: 1.5 5-oz bags of cheddar garlic croutons, 1.5 lbs sausage (1 lb spicy and .5 lb regular), 1.5 t ground mustard, NO extra salt (as croutons add a lot), 14 eggs (it could have even used more eggs--this casserole is heavy on the sausage), about 3.5 c milk (a bit less than the 4.5 c called for in a 1.5 recipe), and maybe 3/4 to 1 lb shredded cheese (less than called for b/c croutons add cheese flavor as well). It baked for about 1 hr 15 minutes at 350. I removed the foil cover for about 20 minutes in the middle, but ended up replacing it for the last 15 mins so the top didn't get too brown. Next time I will add grilled peppers and onions and maybe more eggs. Good to feed a big crew!

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could. I basically made  the recipe as listed but someone recommended using 1 cup 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk, which I did. I also used 7 eggs, and it was out of this world delicious!!

I thought it was so simple and so awesome.  I added mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers to it which I think made it.  Also, I made it with egg beaters, skim milk, and low fat cheese and couldn't tell the difference.  It was wonderful.  Thank you!

I've made this a few times now and think I've perfected it solely on how my family likes things. Its a great starter recipe that's easy to add or subtract things. I used 8 eggs, increased the mustard powder to 2 tsp. (Don't skip the mustard powder, you'd be surprised what a nice flavor it adds!)After going strictly by the recipe the first time, I had to try the garlic&cheddar croutons instead after reading several of the reviews suggesting it. WOW! Never will go back to basic bread with the recipe again! My kids love it for special holidays and since it's only 3 days away, they are making sure I'm going to serve it this Christmas too. It's so nice to get up and pop a casserole into the oven and have it filling the house with its wonderful aroma while we relax and open presents. Thanks so much for sharing this!

I make this recipe using a pound of bacon instead of the sausage, then omit the salt. It has been one of our favorites for many years.  It's a nice special dish for breakfast on Christmas or New Years or just any time.  It's so easy!

very good basic recipe.  i altered as many did - i used six very large slices of french bread cut into large cubes and placed them into a buttered pan, browned and then added jimmy deans maple sausage as the next layer, whisked 11 eggs with 1/2 cup of milk and one cup of half and half - poured that over the bread and sausage layers, topped it with 1 1/2 cups of mexican mix cheese and let it set in the refrigerator overnight. popped it in a 350 degree oven for 45 minutes and it was wonderful.  the family loved it!  i think i'll try using the one reviewers "sweetened" version next time.  thank you for the recipe!

This was tasty!  I do however recommend using 8 eggs, as this was barely enough to feed 4 adults.  Other than that fab.  Easy & tasty = 5 stars.  Thanks Meredith!

The only fault I can find in this recipe is that it is called "Christmas" Breakfast Sausage Casserole, and eating it once a year is not often enough for my family. We have started having it for Easter Brunch as well. I have also noticed a few yummy-sounding variations in the reviews that I will be trying as well. I love that I can prepare it the night before, so I can just wake up and throw it in the oven and enjoy spending the morning with my family rather than in the kitchen... and the kids love that they don't have to wait until I am done preparing breakfast before they start in on their presents.

I have been making a variation of this recipe for about 20 years. The differences are that instead of bulk sausage, mine uses 2 lbs. link sausage, which is browned in the oven at 325 'til done. Also adds one large can sliced mushrooms (or 8 ounces fresh), 6 oz. sharp cheese instead of 8 oz. mild (more flavor), and one can of cream of mushroom soup combined with 5 ounces evaporated milk. The milk is poured over the casserole the night before and the soup mixture is spread over the top just before baking. Wouldn't be Christmas morning breakfast without this dish! :)

This was very good -- a solid 4 star -- and with some playing around, could easily, I think, be a 5 star.

I made it largely as written, though I went a little heavy on the eggs and bread and I followed the advice of several reviews and sauteed some onion with the sausage, and it was delicious -- served it as breakfast-for-dinner and DH liked it very much, too.  The overall product was a little heartier-seeming than I expected, very satisfying.  I'm really inspired to try experimenting with it!  I'm thinking ... maybe adding mushrooms and using Gruyere cheese?  Or bell peppers, onion, and ham instead of sausage?  This seems fabulously adaptable (and it doesn't hurt that it's really easy and inexpensive to fix!).  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Had a brunch yesterday and this was the first thing that went.  Everyone loved it- two people asked me for the recipe.  I didn't even get to taste it!  Made it with 8 pieces of bread and 6 eggs, kept everything else the same.  A big hit!

I have made something similar for years on different occasions.  It is really good to fix for a large group to satisfy that morning hunger.  I use the same ingredients as listed but cover the mixture with saute'd sliced apples seasoned with a little cinnamon and nutmeg then top with the cheese.

I made this for a church breakfast. Everyone loved it. I had read all the previous reviews and here's what I did: I used the Jimmy Dean Maple Sausage, and sauted one small diced onion with it. I also used the Thomas' English Muffin bread instead of white bread. I doubled the recipe, but tripled the eggs.  It made enough for one 9x13 pan and one 8x8 pan. (I know the "single" recipe says one 9x13 pan, but previous posts said it was too "flat". Doubling it as mentioned made it beautiful. Leftovers were microwaved, and also came out great -- definately a keeper.

This recipe is amazingly delicious. I brought it to a work training session and everyone absolutely looooooved it. They couldn't keep their hands off my dish :-). The only things I changed were 1/4 cup red onions, 1/4 cup green onions, 1 bag cheesy garlic croutons instead of bread, turkey sausage that I just grounded in the blender, Monterey jack cheese and just a little cheddar cheese added on top for the last 10 minutes of baking time. Everything else remained unchanged. It was really great. I will definitely make again. Especially if I have to bring a dish to a potluck.

This casserole was easy to make and so good to eat! I had to rescue the last piece to take the picture for Allrecipes. The family gobbled it up. I added a little bit of onion and a small can of green chilies, used 6 eggs and 1 1/2 cups milk. This recipe is a keeper, thank you for sharing.

Excellent easy casserole to make.  I have made this by soaking overnight as well as just soaking the bread cubes in the bowl of egg/milk mixture for 10 minutes and each turns out equally as good.  I find actually it cooks quicker without getting brown on the bottom or crusty if you don't soak overnight.    I have changed this recipe to a sweet version, especially at Christmas time. Didn't think the little ones would like it with eggnog in it, but my 5 year old asked for 3 servings xmas morning and I'm lucky if I get him to eat anything that morning.  So here is what I changed;  1 cup eggnog and 1 cup milk  6 eggs  sprinkled ground maple sausage with cinnamon after it was cooked and drained  omitted the ground mustard and salt  greased the pan with butter crisco  added 1/2 cup more of cheddar cheese (and have made with half swiss/ half cheddar -that was equally as delicious  once in pan, sprinkled the top with nutmeg  ** if eggnog is out of season, I use hazelnut coffee cream 1 cup of that with 1 cup of milk  And I use 6 eggs instead of 4  After its cooked, I take out of oven and drizzled with maple syrup. I let sit for 10 minutes.  It might sound too sweet for some but let me tell you the egg/ cheese/ sausage mixture reduces some of the sweetness of the maple syrup so it is not too sweet.  My kids put more syrup on it at the table.  If no maple sausage, I use regular ground sausage.  It still tastes just as great.

My first attempt ever at a breakfast casserole, and we LOVED it. Went with Jimmy Dean Maple sausage, and it gave a wonderful flavor. Yum!

After making this more than once, I've learned that you really should use white bread as the recipe calls for (or even a loaf bread from the deli). I tried it once with wheat bread because that's what we usually have at our house. It did not soak up the eggs as well and came out a bit dry. The original recipe is great.

My entire family loves this recipe!  I don't even eat eggs (unless they're baked in cookies/cakes) and it's one of my favorite breakfasts.  Although I use 8-10 eggs (in a 9x13 pan) instead of 4, my mom has made it using only 4 eggs when made in a 9x9 pan.

Made this exactly as written a few weeks ago for a simple dinner and it was phenomenal! Husband and daughter raved about it. My mom-in-law makes this every Xmas and I've always wanted to make it, so I'd found this recipe. Fantastic! Even better than MIL's but I won't tell her that. J  Trying it again tonite, sticking it in fridge but this time with 6 eggs, 1C half-n-half, and layering it like a lasagna like other reviewers. BTW left salt out both times - plenty in the sausage already. Will update review after trying it layered style!

My mother found a version of this called Sausage & Cheese Surprise in Discover Brunch and it hasn't missed one of our  Christmas mornings since 1977. It's now working into the third generation. The biggest difference is that our recipe calls for link sausage cut into small pieces and after letting it refrigerate overnight I pour one can of cream of mushroom soup mixed with a /2 cup of whole milk over the top before baking. It just wouldn't be Christmas morning without sausage & cheese surprise and whiskey cake. Merry Christmas everyone.

Very tasty and easy- I only changed a few things based on other reviews.  I used 6 eggs instead of 4 and I used a bag of Marie Callendar's cheese and garlic croutons instead of the bread.  I also omitted the salt due to the use of the croutons.  I layered the croutons on the bottom of the dish and then everything else was mixed together and poured on top.  I made this for a work breakfast meeting and everyone was suitably impressed.

I've made this recipe twice and changed a little bit each time. VERY good base recipe that allows for easy modifications. I personally prefer extra eggs and a little less milk.

Very good basic recipe.   I have made this 3 times so far, once as is, once with shredded potatoes (I should have added extra salt with all those potatoes and maybe pre-cooked them a little) and once with par-boiled diced potatoes. My husband has liked all 3 versions. I like the version with 2 medium sized diced par-boiled potatoes, swiss cheese (instead of cheddar) and 1 extra egg and 1/2 cup extra milk.  This is a great recipe for company. I was able to make ahead and just pop in the oven when I woke up. It is also very filling, especially with potatoes and easy on the wallet (and I usually have all those ingredients already in my house, so I don't even have to go to the store). I usually just serve with a fruit salad on the side. Very good!

We love this in my house! I always use 1 1/2 lbs of sausage and the 1/2 lb is hot! The other is regular or sage. I never toast the bread and have made it with different types of bread & it is always good. I always seem to add sauteed onion & sliced mushrooms and use more cheese than is called for.

This recipe is good but I took the advice of a fellow reader and started using crouton's in the casserole and that has made a BIG flavor difference. I also use Hot Sausage for an extra kick. The dry mustard for me adds a lot of flavor so I make sure to add that in! We top ours with fresh chopped scallions and bacon and it is delicious!

Used the sausage for this.  Didn't really like the fact that you couldn't really tell there were eggs in there - the flavor was dark.  When compared to the Amish Breakfast Casserole, I made both of them to feed more than 30 people; the Amish Breakfast Casserole won hands down.  I had leftovers from this one.

I love this recipe!  It is easy to make, love that I make it the night before then simply bake in the oven the next morning.  I suggest you REALLY drain the sausage by laying it on paper towels before adding to other ingredients.  I have made this several times and have always gotten great response.  Plan to make it for Christmas Breakfast!

If you use breakfast sausage, you should double the recipe to make sure 
it all gets covered.

Very good breakfast to assemble the night before and pop in the oven in the morning!  I did make some changes- 1)omited mustard powder (didn't have it) added fresh pepper, nutmeg and garlic powder in its place 2)increased from 4 to 6 eggs 3) reduced to about 1c. milk (didn't really measure it, just eyeballed) 4) didn't cube or toast the bread- cut off the crusts and arranged to cover the bottom of the pan- used about a 5X7 pan- (9X13 would have made the end dish VERY thin).  5) pour egg/sausage mix over bread, covered with cheese on top (not mixed in) and chill overnight in fridge 6) baked at 350 for 50 minutes and it was done perfectly!

This was delicious with a few changes. Based on other reviewer's suggestions, I reduced the milk to 1 1/2 cups total, and added 6 rather than 4 eggs. I substituted cheese & garlic croutons for the bread, which turned out nicely. I felt that using the full pound of sausage made it a bit overwhelming to the other ingredients, next time I will reduce this amount. To make the casserole festive, I added finely chopped onions, green and red peppers which also added great flavor. Overall, this is an excellent base recipe and the results were excellent, will definitely make again. Thanks!

This is our 3rd Christmas having this casserole. It's so easy to prepare. I doubled the recipe and It was all gone. I used 1 regular sausage and 1 hot. I Added extra eggs and used a little less milk. I used one loaf of texas toast. Next year I would like to mix the maple sausage in with the hot. Everyone really liked it.

My family and in laws really loved this!  Made twice know.  Make night before and then handy to pull out after church on Sunday morning!  I cook the casserole for 45 minutes before we go to church, place it in fridge, and then soon as I get home home I popped the casserole in the oven for 30 more minutes.  Very Easy!  I added 3 more eggs and a  little more mustard powder. Used Jimmy Dean Maple sausage and Texas Toast. Definitely going to make again and again!

Outstanding recipe.  I'll definitely make this one again, and not just for Christmas.  At the suggestion of others, I used the maple sausage, a box of Marie Calendar croutons, and added 2 more eggs.  It even tastes great reheated the next day.

This is a staple item for my family and my office around Christmas time. I double the recipe and bake it in my stone casserole dish. I wrap it in towels to keep it warm for the hour long commute - and it's perfect every time!

We found this to be like omelettes, so we made them individually in the fry pan. However, they were a disappointment. Even with spicy sausage it was still bland. Don't think I'll be making it again.

I try to make this every year for Christmas.  I use spicy sausage and sharp cheddar.  I also do something I haven't seen anyone else do.  I take shredded hashbrowns, cook them until browned, and top the entire casserole with them.  My family adores it!

This is always a favorite for brunch.  A dash of worcestershire sauce adds a nice touch.  I also like to layer my casserole with the bread cubes first, then the sausage and cheese and pour the egg mixture over all of it which bakes up nicely.

Delicious, but time consuming. I give it 5 stars for taste, but only gave it 4 here because of all the time it took. I added two eggs (totaling 6). Mix all the ingredients together quickly once you add the bread. Otherwise, the bread will start to fall apart. I didn't cook it for as long as the recipe called for (about 1 hour total and it was lightly browned). The flavors blended really well together for a great taste. Would be great for company if you have time to wait for it to cook in the morning.

This is, so far, the BEST breakfast casserole I have ever made.  It is about the 4th one I have tried and it was WONDERFUL!! We had friends over for Easter morning breakfast and they raved about how delicious it was.  I thinks mixing all of the ingredients instead of layering each one is the secret.  Also, added more meat than what was called for.  I added about a cup of bacon bits and being from the N. Ky./Cincinnati area I also added about 1lb of goetta.  I also put more cheese on top during the last 10-15 min. of baking.  Thanks!  p.s. this is also an extremely easy recipe to make.

I didnt have high expectations because it seemed too simple to be that good. Boy was I wrong....this was the star at my christmas brunch. They raved more about this than the ham! Let me tell you what I did; I used french bread, cut into cubes instead of sliced bread. I thought i blew it because I accidently added 6 CUPS instead of the 6 slices, it called for. I added a handful of the mexican blend of cheese from costco and then a little over a cup of sharp cheddar. I added 1 extra egg and only used 1 cup of half and half instead of 2 c milk. I added a few tbsp of chopped green onion and that is is! So easy. Next time I make this I would do it exactly the same way. What a great recipe!

This is also our traditional Christmas morning breakfast as it can be made the day before.  I use seasoned croutons versus bread then it is not soggy.  I also increase to 6 eggs and add 1/4 tsp. of onion or garlic powder.  I have found the Jimmy Dean Sage sausage makes this even better!

This was simple to make, I am not sure if the 6 1/2 cups of milk were a little too much though. Mine came out a tad bit juicy, but not too bad. I think 6 pr 5 1/2 cups would have been better for a serving of 25. Anyhow, a lot of people I made it for said they liked it, this is my first meal I made all by myslef. Next time I will add some jalapenos to spice it up. This was fun! You can gradually add or take from the ingredients to make it your very own recipe! Thank you!

Really good!! Used croutons and sage flavored sausage. Lots more cheese, onions and mushrooms. Bacon seemed to get hard, won't use that next time.

GREAT BASE !!! I too also added two more eggs as well as adding Swiss and Havarti cheese. Also, included 1 tsp Garlic Powder & 1 tsp Italian Seasoning. To top things off I also used Croissants instead of bread... YUMMY!!!  Next time I will use 8 or 9 eggs, but I like mine with a little bit more egg.  ~N~

I served this for the first time Christmas morning and everybody loved it! I made one with bacon and one with sausage, following the directions exactly, except I cooked the bacon in strips, then crumbled it, and then sauteed the onions alone in the bacon grease. Though they were both delicious, it seems the bacon was the preferred choice. There were NO leftovers and it was requested that I make it again. Thanks!

After making this three times now, this has turned out great each time.  This is a goto recipe now...as with others all I changed is to add 2 extra eggs.  And for a serving suggestion open a tub of sour cream and a jar of good chunky salsa...yum!

It was great, but I added sauteed mushrooms and onions, once I put in 8oz of cream cheese in blender with eggs,I too use more eggs. I have mixed in spinach and use half and half.  My girlfriends will get up early Christmas morning and be at my house when I am making this. We serve with fruit, pastries and coffee. It is a big hit. I bake it longer at 300 degrees. It gives it more time to cook center without drying out.

Really good.  I used whole-wheat toast instead of white and six eggs instead of four because I wanted to make sure I had enough casserole.  It looked dry before baking, so I drizzled 1/2 cup milk over - not sure if this was necessary, but it turned out well.  I'll make this again.

I made this to bring to my Sunday School class for breakfast and it was very good.  I used sage flavored sausage which gave the casserole a good flavor.  I have made other casseroles with bread that came out very soggy.  Toasting the bread first really made a big difference.  It came out perfect, not too dry and not too soggy.  Thanks!

I'm sorry, but this dish did not turn out well for me.  I followed the directions to the T. It sort of had the texture of bread pudding, which was not what I was looking for.  I had high hopes that it would live up to the title and the reviews, but was disapointed.

This is one of my absolute favorite recipes.  I change it a bit by using more eggs (6-7) and I use croutons instead of the work of toasting and cutting the bread.  I layer rather than mixing - Croutons first, then cheese, sausage, and then I pour the mixture of egg, salt, milk, and mustard on top.  Before I pop it in the oven I mix milk and a can of cream of mushroom soup and spread it on top.  Delicious and so easy!

I enjoyed this recipe but hubby said it felt like something was missing. I think next time I'll try adding broccoli or green peppers or something else that might give it some extra texture. I also think next time I'll bake this in a 8x8 instead of a 9x13.. the latter made it spread out a little too thinly for my liking.

I definately recommend this one, I have made egg casseroles in the past, and they were pretty good, but I loved this one, and everyone said they loved it too, I will defianately make it again, I only used the 4 eggs it called for and it came out great, but I will try the suggestions of others next time and use 6.    I also used the maple sausage, When I told my husband I was making egg casserole for christmas breakfast, he said don't take this the wrong way, but I dont' really care for that, well after he tried a bit, he got more and said this is actually good.   Delicious!!

This is a fantastic recipe.  My family has been making this casserole every Christmas since before I was born.  I will admit that I don't like sausage (or any pork/beef products for that matter) so I am not a huge fan -- but I know that it is the first thing to go when it is served.  you can't go wrong!

You do NOT have to let this sit overnight. Another reviewer said "do not skip step of letting it sit overnight" and that their casserole came out soggy b/c they skipped this step. Well I toasted my bread as recipe calls for and the only change I made was increasing eggs to 6 b/c so many folks said they increased to 6. I cooked immediately after mixing ingredients and pouring in pan. It turned out great!!! Letting it sit overnight is definitely convenient, but don't let that stop you from making this if you are finding this recipe in the morning and that's not an option. :)
Note: Next time I will probably try Maple Sausage. I used regular Mild on 1st try.

I have to agree that this is a basic recipe and needs more vegetables.  I think onions and mushrooms would be a nice touch.

I think this recipe has real potential -- it sounds VERY good -- but I think I would make a few VERY MINOR tweaks to it: such as using a whole-grain bread instead of white bread, and using a blend of cheeses, maybe Pepper Jack, Sharp Cheddar, and something crumbled, like a Bleu or a Feta, for a little more depth of flavor. I also notice that several reviews recommend using only ONE cup of dairy, rather than 2, and some onion, so I would probably do that as well. 

(Yes, yes, I know...I usually preach the idea of trying a recipe as written the first time, then adjusting it after that.)

(Also, I gave it three stars as this was as close as I could get to a neutral rating until I can actually try it.)

Just tried this recipe and after reading the reviews, I followed the recipe almost to the T except I used 8 eggs, 8 slices of wheat toast,2 tablespoons of parsley & 1 1/2 cups of milk to avoid it being too soggy. I also used ground turkey sage sausage. My boys loved it, definitely a keeper!

Love this casserole, but has anyone else found the baking time to be too long?  Has anyone made adjustments to the oven temp or time in the oven that have helped?

My husband wanted an egg bake for his work...after reading some of the many reviews - I made this one but followed the changes that others made using Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage and 6 eggs, 1 bag of garlic cheese croustons, 1 1/2 C. Half & Half and extra cheese.
Turned out very good, the guys at work really liked it and asked for the recipe.

This tasted pretty good; however, the entire thing set and ended up being about 1 inch thick.  Next time I do this recipe, I will add another egg and use a smaller pan!

Very dissapointed. Not sure what I did wrong. This was very runny. If, and that's a big IF, I make this again, I will use more eggs.

I made this recipe for the first time to have on Christmas morning.  I've made other stratas (which is what this casserole truly is) in the past, so I was confident that it should taste good.  I was right!  I assembled everything on Christmas Eve before we went to sleep.  We woke up and put it in the oven, and it was ready for when my parents and in-laws arrived to eat breakfast and exchange presents.  Everyone raved about this dish.  I only made one change to the recipe.  I suggest using 8 large eggs, and keep everything else in the recipe the same.  I also bought maple flavored ground pork (Bob Evans brand).  This will definitely become a staple for my family on Christmas morning.

Overall, too greasy for my taste. I thought it was a very average and bland recipe. If I made it again, I would add sauteed onions and green peppers to make it a little more tasty.

I was really excited about this, great reviews showed promise. I loved being able to make it the night before while we played santa. The taste just wasn't that impressive. I did 8 eggs (as reviewers recommended), jimmy dean maple sausage, cheddar cheese, lil mustard, and layed out texas toast on the bottom of the dish. This is my first breakfast casserole, so maybe I just expected too much. It wasn't horrible, but I will be trying another recipe or adjusting it quite a bit. I will keep trying tho, becuase I love the idea!

I increase the bread to 8-9 pieces of white bread and I have never toasted the bread.  I usually use fresh bread as well.  I increase the eggs to 8 eggs and milk to 2 1/2 cups.  This makes for a fluffier casserole as opposed to a dense, flat dish - it obviously does not change the flavor.  The flavor is excellent!  I have been using this recipe for several years with rave reviews!

I made this for Christmas brunch this morning and it was a hit. I used 12 oz. bob evans maple sausage, and sauted some red pepper with the sausage. Added 2 additional eggs. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. Thanks!

This is good...but I don't know why anyone would make it with bread. This should be with potatoes. Sometimes I even do this as a skillet meal with the exact same ingredients!

DELICIOUS!  My family now makes this breakfast casserole every Christmas!  Like other reviewers, I also use Garlic and Cheddar Croutons.  I also mix the cheese up according to what I have on hand, sharp or mild or both.  I do the same with sausage, spicy, mild or both!  It comes out great every time!!!

This was very good. I didn't notice until after the fact that it needed to be left overnight. While the casserole was good when I cooked it the same day, I think an overnight soak is definitely what it needs to hold the flavors together.

Great recipe! Husband loved it. Cut my recipe in half since there are only three of us -- doubled the amount of eggs called for by the recipe.  Also, didn't mix it all together as suggested by the recipe, but layered it -- bread, sausage, cheese, egg mixture. then 15 minutes before done, added more cheese to the top.  Can't wait to make again!

This was a tasty, easy make ahead for when company comes and you want a nice hot breakfast but don't want to make a mess in the kitchen or take the time to stand around at the stove. Wasn't the most delicious thing I've ever eaten, but it was very acceptable.

Yum! This is a great dish to cook for overnight guests. I used a 9x13 foil pan and lined the bottom with white bread slices (crust removed).  I also used 6 eggs instead of 4 and only used 1.5 cups of milk.  As the sausage was browning I added some chopped onion.  I put it together the night before, then cooked it for 45 minutes at 350 degrees in the morning.  I think it would be good with hot sausage as well.

I make this all the time, yet forgot to rate it until I suggested it to someone today!  We LOVE this recipe!  I do usually up the eggs to 6, and use 6-7 slices of bread, and close to 2 cups of cheese...I just kind of eyeball it.  But this makes breakfast super easy, and is so good!  Even reheated!

I made this for Christmas breakfast and it was a huge hit.  I followed the changes posted here, increased the eggs to 6, 1 1/2 cups milk and more cheese.  I made it again this week and used thick slices of homemade bread, was almost like a french toast casserole. My son's friends were over and he was raving about it, needless to say it disappeared.  This will be a staple in my kitchen, not just for Christmas.

Great recipe!  I followed the advice of a few reviewers and increased it to 6 eggs, and used 1 cup of half & half instead of 2 cups milk.  Couldn't find the Jimmy Dean maple sausage, so I used regular JD sausage.  Also sprinkled extra cheese on top.  This tasted even better the day after I baked it!  Will definitely make this for Christmas breakfast again.

I made this for my Christmas brunch using many of the substitutions suggested.  I doubled the recipe and used 1 lb Jimmy Dean maple sausage and 1 lb Jimmy Dean sage sausage.  I used 1 cup heavy cream and 1 cup regular milk and 2 lbs sharp shredded cheddar cheese.  I reserved some of the cheese to sprinkle on top during the last 15 minutes of baking.  I used a dozen eggs and 2 bags Reese garlic and cheese croutons.  It came out perfectly and my family raved--everyone had seconds.  It also keeps beautifully and tastes great heated in the microwave for several days afterward.

This was a perfect recipe for Christmas morning.  I did, however, double the recipe and used 1 lb. Jimmy Dean Breakfast Sausage and 1 lb. Jimmy Dean Sage Sausage.  I also used texas toast instead of regular bread.  Since there were so many slices, I just put them on a large cookie sheet and popped them under the broiler for a few minutes on each side.  Less expensive that way than using bagged croutons like some others used.  Very delicious!!

VERY GOOD!  I would have liked to have followed this recipe exactly, but, being snowed in with a house full, I had to use what was on hand.  I substituted a pound of bacon for the sausage, added two extra eggs so it would go further, and replaced the cheddar cheese with mozzarella cheese.  It was very good, and I must admit I was surprised.  Thank you M.K. Meredith for such a very good recipe that accepted changes well.

this was ok, a little bland for our tastes. I would added some canned green chilis to spice it up next time.

A good basic recipe.  I used Leah Joy's idea and used half and half, added more eggs, used Texas Garlic toast, and added sharp cheddar cheese.  Also added hot sausage with the regular.  When I cooked the sausage, I added green onions and garlic powder.  Layed the Texas toast on the bottom of the pan (whole), then the sausage, then added the mixture, which I also added chili powder to it and some of the Texas toast diced.  It was a hit at our Twelve days of Christmas breakfast.  Thank you for this web site. Diane Jackson

My family and I love this recipe.  I make it every Christmas and usually one other time during the year.  I follow the recipe exactly, except I use sage sausage.

I loved this!  I changed it a little, mostly because I hate sausage.  But, I followed others recommendations and used garlic croutons, 8 eggs, increased cheese, and a pinch more mustard powder.  I also used kielbasa instead of sausage and it was delicious.  Will make it again for christmas next year!

Excellent. I too doubled the recipe and it fit perfectly in my 9x13 dish. My family loved it for our Christmas brunch! I used a package of Grands buttermilk biscuits instead of bread. Bake them until golden brown and cut into pieces in place of bread. Delicious. Also, we don't eat pork so I used 2lb turkey sausage seasoned with worceshire sauce and onion soup mix. (turkey sausage is very bland) Also added hot pepper flakes. Next time I'll add onion and green pepper when no kids are eating. Another great add in is Ranch dressing, leave out dry mustard with ranch. This is great. Def will make over and over again!

YUM!  I split the recipe into 2 pie plates; 1 w/4 slices toasted white bread; 1 w/cheese/garlic croutons.  Both are good, but the crouton version is better.  Used 10 eggs and full amount of milk;also whisked 1 packet of country gravy mix into the milk before whisking into the eggs.  added green onion to both versions; green chiles to one of them.  Baked per orig directions.  I really don't think you can mess this up!  Can't wait to try one with bacon and mushroom.  Yumyumyum!!  This is the PERFECT solution for any Holiday morning!!  Thanks for posting!

This is my FAVORITE recipe. My mother-in-law makes this every Christmas and the recipe was orginally found it in a church cookbook. I usually omit the bread cubes as my husband has Celiac Disease. I get requests for this recipe ALL the time, made exactly as is and when I omit the bread cubes. I've even made it with turkey breakfast sausage, eggbeaters, and 2% cheese and it still gets rave reviews.

First thing my husband said on November 1st of this year, "It's almost time for that breakfast casserole!"  So this is pretty much one of the best things about Christmas dining.  I do make sure to drain the sausage to avoid the casserole becoming too greasy.

I use a box of curtons instead of bread.  I make these to give to family on christmas eve night so they can cook it christmas morning.  Fits perfect in the square 8x8 tins so you don't have to worry about getting your dish back:)  Used the extras eggs suggested by others and halfNhalf I also like the breakfast sausage but spicy would be good for adults.

Yum!  This was so well-received in our house on Christmas morning!  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and used maple sausage, as well as six eggs.  The casserole set up perfectly and was delicious.  I love the taste of mustard, so I'll likely add more next time.  We're looking forward to enjoying this again and again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was so disappointing.  I thought with almost 500 good reviews I couldn't go wrong, but both my husband and I (as well as several ladies from our church) thought this recipe was bland. Sorry!

I have tried a lot of casseroles and like this the best.  I did add 2 extra eggs and used both italian sweet and hot sausage.  It was even good as leftovers, which is rare for an egg casserole.

I just made this casserole for my MOPs group, and it was wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly, using Texas Toast and a block of colby/cheddar cheese. I also used the Jimmy Dean Maple Sausage- sooo good! Ground a little pepper on top after it came out of the oven. My husband was disappointed that it was all eaten at the meeting-- I think he was hoping for leftovers! So I guess I'll be making this again soon... :).

This was excellent.  Made this for Christmas morning.  Making it again this weekend for company.  I save all my left over bread ends throughout the year and freeze them.  Come Thanksgiving and Christmas I use them for stuffing or casseroles like this.  I had pieces of french bread, rye bread, sourdough and white in the casserole and it was excellent!

Why wait till Christmas morning?  I made this for supper one night, and my family loved it!  Added some black pepper and green onion, and only let it sit for a few hours, but it turned out great.  And yes, you really have to grease the pan!!!!

This was a great recipe! I tweaked it a little using 6 eggs garlic and onion powder. I also reserved some of the cheese sprinkled it on top (Used sharp cheddar) then topped with browned hash browns. Delicious! And it went so far!

This was great!! 
I've had this before, a lettle different, so I kind of combined the recipes. I used the ingredients ( which calls for sourdough sliced bread) of this one and the directions of the other. Rather than having it sit overnight, I combined ingredients, mixed it up and let it sit about 20 minutes or so.  It turned out perfect and really yummy! Would definitely make again!

This tasted yummy!  I've never done this type of dish before.  I made the changes recommended in an earlier review...6 eggs, Sage saugsage, 1 c half and half instead of milk, Texas toast instead of regular bread and only cooked it 30 min, covered.  I will definitely keep it in my recipe book...

Superb breakfast dish!

I noticed some complaints in other reviews about the mild flavor. For me, the sausage and cheese used make or break this one! My first try was very flat in taste. The second try I switched brands of sausage and cheese. I wouldn't have believed it was the same recipe!

In this area (eastern NC), I find Jamestown brand mild sausage highly seasoned enough to work beautifully.

I am also fortunate enough to have access to sharp 'wheel' cheese, not the prepackaged Kraft stuff. I mix in about a cup (shredded) in the casserole and sprinkle more on top before baking. I like cheese, obviously.

The result - a nicely flavored dish that brings compliments.

I have made this recipe 5 times now. Its so easy and tasty! This is our regular Sunday morning breakfast! We like to use Apple smoked chicken sausage which gives it an extra little flavor. Im considering trying this with some spinach or maybe mushrooms in the future. Thanks for the recipe its just wonderful!!!!

I made 3 different versions of this for Easter.  I made one change on all of them - I used 6 eggs instead of 4.  The first casserole was sausage, like in the recipe and it was very good.  The 2nd was using lump crab meat (8 oz) - I used 1 tsp of Old Bay in place of the salt - DELICIOUS!  The last was a "veggie" version - instead of meat, I used mushrooms, fresh tomato, green onions and green pepper - very yummy!  My personal favorite was the crab meat one, but they were all super easy and a big hit at our Easter Breakfast!  Thanks!

I made this for Christmas morning and my whole family loved it. I prepared it the night before and popped it in the oven while we all opened gifts. It was wonderful. We did find it a little salty due to the sausage, next time I make this I'll omit the salt. But I will definately serve this again.

I made this for a bible study holiday brunch this morning and it was a huge favorite, with many requests for the recipe.  It was very simple, and travelled well, staying warm my insulated carrier until over an hour later!   It was my first attempt at any kind of breakfast casserole, usually grabbing the baked goods spots.  Thank you for such a successful beginning!

This casserole is wonderful. My sister made this during the holidays, and it was an instant hit. We have made it several times since then and there are never any leftovers. This casserole is excellent if you need to eat and run, because it is made the night before.

I make this every year for Christmas morning (by popular demand). It's fun to mix it up a bit and use Italian sausage, add chopped mushrooms, peppers and onions to the pan and sauté them a bit before assembling the strata. It is helpful if it sits out for 30 to 60 mins to come to room temp prior to baking.  We serve it with fruit salad and homemade pumpkin bread for a lovely Christmas breakfast. Tip: the number of eggs should be higher;  I use 8 eggs, 6 to 8 slices of whole wheat/multigrain bread, 1 lb. of sausage, and add mushrooms, onions and red and green peppers for color when sautéing the sausage, 1 1/2 cups of skim milk.  We top it with sharp cheddar then bake 60 mins or so. It's always a hit!

I really liked this recipe! I was surprised at how much it makes. I used a disposable, square Reynolds non-stick baking pan. My changes were made after reading so many reviews:

I used Texas Cheese & Garlic croutons. The only problem was that I didn't know how many croutons equated to a slice of bread. So I used a whole 5 oz. bag of croutons. I also didn't layer the bottom of the pan with the "bread" as others suggested; instead I mixed it all up together. Which resulted in soft, yummy croutons throughout the casserole. If you don't like bread, you could put it all at the bottom, then maybe not slice as deep. I don't like lots of bread so I picked off the croutons that were on top.

It was VERY moist; however, I baked it uncovered for 45 minutes, checked it, then put it back in for 7 minutes. I can't imagine leaving it in for those additional 30 minutes that the recipe calls for. Mine is perfectly moist...not slurpy...not dry. I will make this again when my kids have their next sleepover!

This was so good! I only had 4 slices of bread but I wanted to make it anyways so I just used 1 cup of milk instead of 2. If I had just made scrambled egg with cheese, sausage and toast on the side it wouldn't have been nearly as satisfying and my kids wouldn't have eaten that way either but my kids lived this casserole and asked for seconds. If I didn't have a picky husband and picky kids I would add red bell pepper and yellow onion.

I have been making this now for 21 years on Christmas morning...I agree its so good because we only have it then..I think my family would be very disappointed if I stopped. I  only do one think different. I use white bread and butter the bottom and then layer it.

I am guilty of not following the recipe... I just layered the ingredients like some reviewers mentioned, just because I didn't get to refrigerate it overnight and I thought that layering will produce a less soggy mixture. Also, I only side 1 cup of milk for the same reason. Turned out tasty and not soggy at all even though I made it and baked it within the hour.

So good my family begs for this all year round! I added half a bag of drained spinach, diced tomato and half diced onion. When I can't find those square bread crumbs, I buy afrench bread loaf, slice and sprinkle dry ranch packet on the bread. Bake until bread is browned and cut thos in small cubes. So delish!

I have been. Along this for years with one tweak. My family always asks for it. One day I couldn't remember an ingredient so I was happy to find a similar version here. Instead of bread , I line the bottom of the pan with frozen potato cakes. Delicious. Also the recipe tastes great when you bake it right away but it holds up much better when it sits overnight.

I also agree this is a good "base" recipe for a Breakfast Strata.  Depending on the crowd we either make a savory or a sweet version of this.  Savory version, finely chop a half sweet onion, red, poblano & jalapeño pepper & sauté with the sausage (either mild Italian, spicy breakfast or other) and use a good stale sourdough bread.  Sweet version, peel and finely chop 1 or 2 apples, add some dried cranberries & blueberries and sauté with sausage, use a hearty whole wheat bread and add a little molasses, cinnamon & maple syrup to the milk/egg mixture.  Letting this sit overnight is key.  When you get up to let the dog out in the morning all you need do is turn on the oven, put Strata in, go back to sleep for an hour and when you wake up breakfast is done by the time the coffee is ready!

I have made this recipe for years and we gobble it down!!  It also travels well if you are going to a breakfast carry-in.  The only change I've made over the years is the addition of some chopped peppers and onions -- be careful, the onions can get overwhelming.

This is a great "use what ya got" recipe. I'm sure it's great as is but I changed it to use a few things in the fridge. I used 7 eggs (med size from a friend), 2 cups organic whole milk, 1/2 loaf of 2 day old rustic wheat artisan bread cubed, 1/2 lb diced ham, 4 beef jalapeno natural sausage, 1 1/2 cups vintage white cheddar, Himalayan Pink Salt, rainbow pepper, garlic powder, & freeze dried shallots. omitted the mustard powder. Browned sausage and ham in a 12in cast iron skillet, let cool slightly and mixed everything right into the skillet. Let sit on counter for 1/2 hour till the bread had absorbed the egg mixture. Baked 40 mins on 325*. It came out great! Be creative and waaste not, want not :)

I made this almost exactly as it was written, except that I didn't soak the mixture overnight as my husband was taking it to a work party in the morning. I let it soak for about an hour before baking it and the bread seemed saturated.

Since my husband took the dish in and returned it empty, it was surely a hit at the office party.  Thus, I plan on making it again so I can taste it!

Very simple. I added 50% more egg/milk/mustard/salt mixture because I added 1.5 cups finely diced potatoes, 4 slices of bacon (cut into ½" pieces), and about a cup of chopped dinosaur kale. I cooked as directed and it came out great!

Add garlic, scallions and any vegetable you want = perfection!  Perfectly fine not letting it sit overnight.

I did actually make this for Christmas brunch and it was so easy and really delicious!  Company loved it!  I served other dishes with it that needed attention, so this was the perfect.  I used an apple chicken sausage and fresh Italian bread.  My husband doesn't really like cheese so I cut it down by half, and trust me, that was plenty.  It doesn't seem like there are enough eggs for a breakfast casserole, but the bread makes it really light and fluffy.  I highly recommend it!

My very FIRST recipe made! It was quite a pleasant casserole and very easy to make! I followed used all original ingredients in the recipe -- I did add spinach. I mixed in about 2 cups. I am not sure if it added or took away from the recipe but I can say this, my husband and I LOVED it! It tastes great as left overs as well.

Wonderful base recipe for egg casserole. I can't ever follow exact directions as I love to throw things and try different combinations. Do love using the cheese and garlic croutons. Use some half and half with the milk. Extra eggs. Throw in some jalapenos. It is a hit every time no matter what type of sausage or any other "extra" ingredients. Thanks!

This is a good casserole for day old bread. I added 2 more slices because the mixture looked too watery before I baked it. Good flavor. But, I would add more cheese and less milk.

This recipe was so easy and was so good!  I would recommend making a double batch if you have four or more people eating it and it's the main dish because it doesn't make much and I ran out since everyone loved it!

I used croutons and sage sausage. My husband and I liked it. But my kids wouldn't eat it. I'll have to try and make it again. Next time change things around so maybe my picky eaters will like it.

I made this on Christmas morning and it was delicious!  I followed other reviews and used 6 eggs instead of 4 and I think that it was the perfect amount.  I also used extra sharp white chedder cheese.  I didn't have any mustard powder so I used a tablespoon of dijon mustard and it was so yummy!  My boyfriend even asked if we could make the breakfast our christmas tradition :)

Excellent! I used just regular Jimmy Dean Sausage and threw in my own seasonings, sauteed onions, plain white bread toasted and cubed, mild and sharp cheddar and up'ed the eggs to 8 with 1+1/2 cup of milk. Layered it in an 7x11 dish. Not at all soggy. Came out nice and thick and fluffy. Gonna try this with bacon next time. The possibilities are endless.

I have been making a version of this for 20 years and is always a treat!  I reserve about 1/2 cup of the milk, mix it with 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and pour that mixture overall in the morning before putting it in the oven.  Makes it much moister and 
 always gets raves!

I love this, make it every morning after Thanksgiving and Christmas morning. But, I use 10 eggs and 10 slices of bread. Always use the hot & spicy sausage and pour in a bit of pure maple syrup when the sausage is just about done. Fabulous and a family tradition. I love to have breakfast ready that I made the night before! Put it in the oven before you start opening gifts and then it is ready by the time you are finished. Yum!

"Best Breakfast Casserole you have ever served."  and considering the number of breakfast casseroles I have made that is a compliment!  I used sourdough bread just for fun but otherwise followed recipe exactly.

This was so easy and delicious!  Used diced bacon as had no sausage which was great, but looking forward to trying with pork & sage sausage meat.  As I was looking for a quick dinner recipe I made it and cooked it straight away, and as I had a warmed ceramic baking dish, hot bacon, and it hadn't chilled overnight in the fridge, it only took 25-30 minutes to be perfectly cooked.  Kids loved it too, and the leftovers were still delicious when gently reheated in the microwave the next day.  Thanks for such a lovely recipe, I will make it ready for Christmas Breakfast this year.

THe first time i made this i thought the flavor was a little bland.. i normally cook with a lot of spices so im sure that was just my prefrence.  The second time i made this, i used the recipe as a base..  i ended up adding 1 lb of sausage, cubed ham, bacon, onions and 2 cubbed potatos as well. i also added sage, garlic and onion powder to the mix as well. y guy doesnt like much cheese so we only used about a half cup of cheese in the mix. 
Left over night to absorb, by morning it was nicely puffed up and all the liquid was absorbed. It baked up perfectly and my guy loved it.. he was reluctant at first because he doesnt like trying new things but he has since requested it again. 
4 stars because i thought the origionaly was a bit bland but a great base for personalization!

I've already made this recipe 4 times already this year! This is so easy to make and incredibly delicious if you prepare it the night before. I wish I had this recipe when my kids were younger. The leftovers are perfect for a quick, hot breakfast before work or school!

Warning - did not look AT ALL like it would taste good when I put it in my refrigerator overnight but was pleasantly surprised when it was done baking. It was very "bready" but I love bread so it was great to me. I added 6 eggs and 1 cup half and half and also added cheese on the top. Wonderful!

This is very good. I used croutons instead of toast. I assembled it a little differently---I first put sausage in bottom of baking dish, sprinkled sausage with cheese and then poured the mixture of milk, eggs and mustard on top. I refrigerated it overnight. It was yummy! This is an easy recipe to change to your family's liking.

Overall this casserole was very good.  I liked that it served a family of 4 and only used 4 eggs.  Most breakfast casseroles are for a crowd and use a dozen eggs.

Very disappointing. It was definitely edible but for all the prep time I was expecting something great. Wouldn't make again. Like my husband said, we could have just made eggs, sausage and toast and it would have taken an 1/8 of the time and probably been better.

This was well received with the suggestions gleaned from other reviews. I used the maple sausage and some commented on how good it tasted. I used a couple more eggs, 1.5 cups half & half. I also used my Corning oval baking dish (3 qt?) so the egg mixture would be thicker. I used regular thick white bread without drying it out and it was fine. Very nice! Thank you!

This was very good and very easy to make.  I was concerned when I read it had bread in it that it might taste like soggy bread but it didn't at all.  The bread soaked up some of the egg and baked up nice.  A big hit for our Christmas breakfast.

Really good-great easy meal on Christmas morning.  I used 10 eggs & 2 full cups of 2% milk.  I added yellow & green onions, green peppers, & sauteed mushrooms(on the side).  I didn't have any croutons & though plain white bread would be bland, so I used Stove Top Stuffing instead & it was very flavorful!  Will definitely make this again on Easter & try it with ham & then next Christmas-one with bacon & another with sausage again.  Thanks for the start of a new tradition here:)

My family looks forward to this casserole every Christmas morning. I prepare the evening before and take to my daughters house and pop in the oven while the grandkids open presents. Makes a hearty breakfast that even the picky eaters love :)

this used to be one of my favorite breakfast dishes, but i stopped eating eggs a little over a year ago.  i still enjoy making it for others!   we prepare it using 6 eggs at night and generally wheat bread instead of white.   one time i prepared it the night before, but forgot to cook it the next morning.  that evening, i decided to cook it for "breakfast-dinner", but added 6 more eggs as it looked dry.  that made a huge difference.  next time, try adding 6 more eggs just before cooking and it will be souffle-like!

I do not consider myself a brilliant cook, but I made it for my church choir to munch on in a break on a LOOONNNG Saturday rehearsal and they absolutely loved it!!  I heard many opinions that I had "outdone myself."  Which was awesome...thanks to who posted this recipe for making me look like a brilliant cook.  I'm a teacher also...covered dish is tomorrow...and now I'm about to make it again.  THIS is now my go-to dish!  :)  PS- I left out the mustard...not a fan of the stuff, sorry, but no one missed it

Very simple and good.  I ran out of bread so I used 6 hamburger buns toasted under the broiler and cut up into cubes, it's a great way to use up any bread that is going stale.

Made this for dinner the other night & it was wonderful. This is going to be a regular thing in my house from now on. I did not have any mustard powder so I used a tablespoon of prepared mustard. Also chopped some onion & added to the sausage as it was cooking.

Super-easy!  I used egg whites instead of regular eggs and it worked fine.  If I made it again, I'd probably add more flavor with either tabasco or red pepper flakes.

I made this for a wedding shower brunch and it was a hit.  The only change I made was to cook it in the crockpot as I had other things in the oven.  I made it the day of and cooked it on low for 3 1/2 - 4 hours.

My family and friends not only had seconds but they also had third!. That was a huge HIT on Christmas morning. I read all the reviews and these are the changes I made. I used Half and Half instead of milk; used a bag of Marie Callender Cheddar/Garlic Croutons instead of 6 slices of bread. I added 3tbs of scallions to the milk/ egg mixture and I increased a bit the amount of dry mustard. I also used 6 eggs. I can't express my gratitud enought to ALLRECIPES for this wonderful recipe. My husband was upset that I did not make another batch!

I cut the milk to 1 cup and added: chopped onion, minced garlic and chopped center cut bacon (while browning the sausage). Also used garlic croutons, and added diced green chilies to the egg mixture. My husband suggested to double the number of eggs. If so, I would probably go to 1.5 cups of milk. It was enjoyed by all. If you use croutons, make sure there are no strong flavors coming through that you don't like. I picked up some that had a strong fennel flavor that I thought overpowered the taste, but others did not mind.

I gave this dish 5 stars because it was easy to make and tasted really great. I took the advice of a few reviewers (that's what it's for, right?) and put in 2 cups of milk and used 8 eggs with the 6 slices of toast and maple flavored sausage. Both the kids and 5 adults finished off the entire dish!! I put this together and then put it right in the oven. I dont think it turned out slimey or too stiff. Awesome recipe, I'll use this again for sure!

I thought thiswas really good ... my family often doesn't like these because of the 'squishy' texture even after it is cooked.  This one has less liquid than many so that doesn't seem to be a problem.  I also used 6 (fairly thick) slices of day old Italian style bread, so maybe that helped too??  The only other change was to add 1 tsp savory as well as the mustard powder, but anything could be added to this versatile recipe!  Thanks for posting

Great as is! But it is also a great starter for many variations. I use more eggs and croutons and hashbrowns most of the time! I like to add more cheese, Salsa, diced tomatoes w/chile peppers, bacon, ham, or whatever I am craving! About an hour to cook in a 13x9 and I also mix all ingrediants together then top with a little more cheese for the last 15 min. I recomend following recipe first time then let your imagination and tayste buds run wild! Its fun and I havent made a bad one yet or one that wasnt the first dish to disapeer! Great for early tailgaiting, Rewarding employees or co-workers and of course for Christmas!

I love this recipe, especially because I can prepare it the evening before.  Christmas morning is at our house.  I made a few modifications to the original though.  I make this one for my mother and kids and make another with peppers and onions for myself and the rest of the family.  They are both great, so good in fact I am making it for easter as well.

Loved this recipe.  I added mushrooms and green onions (sauteed them in the sausage oil). I increased the eggs to 6, use only a cup of half and half instead of 2 cups of milk. It was sooooo good.

Really delicious and a bit hit with my guests.  I needed a 13 x 9 pan so I used 6 eggs instead of 4.  I also used sharp cheddar instead of mild.  Finally, I had leftover ciabatta so I sliced and toasted it before cutting it into cubes.  You just need enough to cover the bottom of the pan in a single layer. YUMMY!

Absolutely amazing!  Many members of my family who have been making breakfast casseroles for years LOVED this recipe more than any they had tried!  I browned beef, bacon and sausage together with onion and pepper, about 3 days ahead of time, and froze them together so the flavors could fully blend.

I have made this recipe - or a very similar version of it many times.  For what it's worth:  make it in advance - soaking the bread seems to allow it to set up better and keeps you out of the kitchen all morning.  Use flavored sausage i.e. I combine HOT and Sage sausage and the taste is wonderful.  I also up the sausage and cheese.  I prefer to use a good dense Italian bread as well.

I made this for Thanksgiving morning.  It was just okay - nothing special.  Will keep looking for another recipe.

The bread was too bland and the cheese didn't really do anything for the whole dish.  The flavors didn't meld together nicely either.

I was expecting so much more after so many high ratings! This was disappointing, but I won't give up on it just yet... I think it is a good base recipe. Something is off with this- maybe the bread to egg ratio or the cook time.

I was surprised I liked this so much.  I made it as part of a breakfast get together and received several compliments on it.  I did, however, change things a bit... I don't eat pork, so I used Turkey Breakfast Sausage.  I browned the turkey sausage with some green bell pepper, onion and some additional seasonings.  And I followed others suggestions and I layered the ingredients.  Bread on the bottom, then the sausage mixture, topped with the eggs and finally, cheese. I too added more eggs.  I wonder if this is due to the amount of bread.  Did the original recipe use white wonderbread or the larger slices of bread?  There's a huge difference between the two, so I imagine that contributes to the need for more eggs. :)

This is wonderful. It seemes like such a basic recipe...I didn't think it would be as yummy as it is.  Like others, I increased my eggs from 4 to 6. Instead of dry mustard, I used prepared mustard (it's all I had). I had some bread crust cubes I've saved and had frozen. I toasted those in the oven as it preheated. I would be proud to serve this for company.

It was good, but I thought it need more egg.  I had even added an extra egg but my husband agreed that it could have used more. Not only that, the sausage overpowered everything else, hence, the need more egg. I will try it again, but probably tweak it a little.

This recipe was very good! However I could not give it 5 stars because even though it was very good it did not WOW me. I chilled the casserole for about 5 hours instead of 8 because I was running a little short of time, and it baked up wonderfully. I also had to cut the cooking time by about 20 minutes or it would have burned. We also used spicy sausage for added flavor. I would also HIGHLY recommend using sharp cheddar cheese instead of mild, as I have found using mild makes it a little bland and the sharp cheddar adds flavor. I will make this recipe again!

Christmas morning was a real treat for my family.  This breakfast casserole was superb.  Following suggestions, I checked at 30 minutes, added more eggs (total 8), used sharp cheese, 1 chopped onion and omitted the salt.  In place of the ground pork, I used turkey sausage.  What a treat!

Not sure how anyone could give this a low rating and say it was bland.  This is the best, even without the changes.  Per several other reviewers, I upped the eggs to 6 and used Maple Sausage (Jimmy Dean).  I mixed in 1/2 cup each chopped green onion and red pepper and added about 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes for a little kick. We just gobbled it up this Christmas morning.

I made some changes to this recipe based on other reviews and personal preference - namely, halved the sausage, used 6 eggs, 8oz of cubed french bread, and sprinkled the cheese on top.  It was delicious!  It ended up with a bit of a bread pudding texture.  I will definately be making this again when we have overnight guests.

I make this dish whenever we have overnight guests and everybody raves! I did make it as the recipe stated initially, but the following substitutions were necessary and definitely enhanced the flavor: Jimmy Dean Maple flavor sausage, 6 eggs (instead of 4) and sharp (not mild) cheddar cheese. I plan to try the sage sausage at some point to see the difference in flavor. Great recipe!

This turned out wonderful!  I added a small chopped white onion to the sausage (used maple sausage).  I doubled this recipe using 1/2 mild cheddar and 1/2 sharp, and added extra eggs after reading other posts.  It filled an 11x9 pan and an 8x8 pan.  The 11x9 is still in the fridge for tomorrow morning, but I couldn't resist baking the smaller one right away.  It turned out wonderful even though it didn't chill overnight.  I didn't have to cook it as long, since it was smaller.  Pretty easy recipe, and very good!  Thanks.

Great recipe M.K.  We tried it in Texas muffin pans and they were great for individual servings. Made it just as you wrote it, no need for any changes.  Never could understand why someone tries a recipe and makes changes before they try the original way first.

Based on previous reviews, I was really expecting this dish to wow me – but it’s a pretty mundane dish. I used whole wheat bread cubes and 6 oz pepper jack cheese with 4 oz sharp cheddar cheese (I was trying to add more kick). I agree with the reviewer that said if you love eggs and sausage you will love it regardless of how it's prepared. In the end I don't think that all that preparation and cooking time was worth the taste of the casserole. It may have been more interesting with green onions and a dash of Tobassco, and add a layer of cheese to the top just before you take it out of the oven. Whatever. I’m still looking to be wowed by a sausage casserole so I’m going to try the other sausage casserole recipes with additional ingredients.

This was fantastic. I brought it to a rather large outdoor summer brunch party and it was a huge success. I did make some changes and increased the quantity. I used 1 pound of spicey pork sausage and 1 pound of maple pork sausage. Increased the mustard powder to 2tsp. used 2 tsp. of salt, 20 eggs, 6 cups of milk, 2 6oz boxes of ceasar flavored croutons, 1 pound each cheddar cheese and monterey jack, a tsp of black pepper, 1/2 cup chopped green onions, 1/2 cup white onions and a can of mushrooms.  I also had to increase the baking time to about 2 hours beacuse it makes so much more.  The ceasar croutons I think really made this dish special. It really added great flavor.

I make this Xmas eve every year for morning brunch with our grown kids.  Each year I get more daring.  Try Italian-seasoned or chorizo sausage instead of plain, cornbread or other stuffing instead of the plain bread cubes, pepper jack, swisss or another spicy cheese instead of cheddar, and addsome sauteed green or red pepper, red onions, etc. for color and variety

Yummy!  I am not an egg person but this was delicious.  Everyone raved - easy to make but a bit time consuming to cook (had to get up a bit early, I am not a morning person) - but still worth it.  Will make again and again all year round, not just for Christmas.

I think I would have enjoyed this recipe more if I'd been able to use the maple sausage as suggested by other users.  From Canada and now living in Western Australia, there are many things I cannot find in the stores that I am accustomed to, including anything maple smoked!  The italian sausgae I used didn't taste very good in this, so next time, I think I will add some shredded hashbrowns, some ham and some green onions. Thanks for the breakfast casserole idea!!

This was OK but I added 2 more eggs and 1 cup of milk, a little more cheese, and one more slice of bread.  The recipe didn't seem to have enough liquid.  It turned out very good.

This is a really good recipe.  And it was wonderful to smell breakfast cooking while opening gifts Christmas morning.  My one year old tried to pull the pan out of the fridge the night before and spilled a lot of it, but it was good anyway!

I discovered this last Christmas when I was planning my menus for the holiday guests.  Since then, I find myself making it more often just for my family so there is more for us to enjoy.  Even my six year old asks for seconds.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I tweak it a little each time, spicy or mild sausage, more or less spices (I always salt, pepper, garlic powder, scallions, even some adobo), skim milk or a mix of skim & half & half, but have made it every Thanksgiving, Christmas & Easter morning.  Amazing!  Making it the night before is a MUST & I always use thick bread, like texas toast or french toast bread.   I have never toasted the bread before & it comes out perfect.  If yours looks soggy after cooking for the required time, cover it with foil, reduce heat a little & cook longer.  This recipe is GREAT & after making it several times, you will find the way you like it best!

Absolutely fantastic casserole! I did do some changes though and mixed all ingredients in a kitchenaid mixer for at least 15 minutes. 
Instead of 4 eggs I used 8, and 8 slices of white bread, 2 1/4 cup milk and 1 1/2 lbs. Jimmy Dean Hot Breakfast Sausage. I only baked for 45 min before removing lid (I used Rachel Ray To Go Casserole Dish) then left the temperature at 375 for the remaining 30 minutes. Once I removed from oven I put the lid back on for 15 minutes to sit. 
My parents have been back 2 weekends in a row for this dish- definitely a family favorite now!

Excellent recipe !   What. I.  have learned from a  friend who made this at her B and B.    Use a mixer.  To combine all items.   The difference in the taste is amazing !   This is easy too !  Maple sausage adds to the flavor and the salt,  NOT. necessary !   I make this every Christmas !  Enjoy. !

This is a delicious recipe. I didn't let it sit overnight and it was still great. I'm not so sure why the long cooking time, though.  I cooked mine covered in a 9x9 pyrex dish for 45 minutes and it was perfectly done. Next time I will add green chiles and spice it up a little.

I love this recipe and was thrilled to find it a couple of years ago. I increase the eggs and bread by 50% (6 eggs instead of 4, and 9 slices of bread instead of 6) so it is a bit taller, slightly airier. I make this for special occasions, and usually make two - one with a cup of chopped portobello mushrooms and one without. Neither last long, thanks again for sharing!

My family has made this for 20+ years with a few differences.  We mix 6 eggs , 2 cups of milk, the dried mustard, a little ground black pepper and a splash or two of Worcestershire sauce into a bowl.  Then we take the cooked sausage, 6 slices of bread (torn into small pieces) and about 12 oz of shredded Colby Jack cheese.  Build it like a casserole , start with a greased 9x13 dish, then add a layer of sausage, layer of bread, layer of cheese (and repeat so there are 2 layers of everything.  
Then pour the eggs & milk mixture over the top of the layers.  Add a little extra shredded cheese, to the top, cover it and refrigerate overnight. Same baking instructors as the recipe.  It's the BEST!!

I made this for a baby shower brunch. It was easy and everyone loved it. I made a few changes to it. I used colby cheese instead of cheddar, half-and-half instead of milk , and sourdough bread instead of white bread at the same amounts as this recipe indicates. I used 6 eggs instead of 4 and I added a splash of Tabasco. 

Cook sausage until brown, stirring to crumble; drain well. Cut the ends off the sourdough bread; butter both sides, cube it and place in the bottom of the dish. Spoon sausage over the bread; sprinkle with cheese. Combine eggs, half-and-half, dry mustard, salt and a splash of Tabasco; mix well, and pour over cheese. Cover casserole and chill overnight. 

Remove from refrigerator 15 minutes before baking. Bake casserole uncovered at 350 degrees for 45 minutes or until set. Enjoy!

Yummy! Use sausage that's not too strong tasting and the kids will love it. Also need to cook longer than recommended. Also use very large pieces of home baked bread or more slices then recommended of store bought.

I made this for Christmas morning one year, and it is now my most requested treat. I have started making them in muffin tins and this is even more popular. Far less cooking time too, and great for freezing and eating one at a time. I add a dash of sriracha for a little heat too.

Good Grief, is this ever delicious!  I made it mostly for my BF because he is a bigger breakfast eater than I, but I think I loved it even more than he did.  I did make some minor changes, mostly because when I went to make it I realized some of my ingredients had "vanished" (men are really good for that- raiding the fridge and not caring if items were meant for a recipe!).  I was almost out of milk, so I used one cup milk and one cup heavy cream.  I didn't have quite the full amount of cheddar, so I ripped up a few slices of American cheese to make up for it. Following some of the reviews, I upped the eggs to 6 and I also replaced the bread with garlic and cheese croutons.  Finally, I opted for Jimmy Dean's spicy sausage, because we like a little kick.  This is really fabulous- easily one of my favorite recipes on this site.  It also reheats beautifully, and I am sure it freezes well too, if it actually lasts long enough to get there!  Thanks so much for this awesome recipe!  I will be making it often  :)

I made this for Christmas brunch this year, doubled the sausage and used 10 eggs doubling everything else as well. I also used whole slices of crustless bread and layered the bottom of the casserole with these first as suggested by other reviewers.  Then after cooking a chopped onion with the sausage, I layered this next and then added the egg mixture. Finished it off topped with the cheese. Set overnight and followed instructions for baking exactly on Christmas morning. I was afraid of what this was going to turn out like since I hadn't made it before and I had company for brunch but to my great pleasure and surprise, it was fantastic!!!  Not going to wait for Christmas to make this again.

Really simple and very easy to make. I've done what other reviews have said and added a couple of eggs and have used cubed soft Italian bread and regular "hearty" white country bread and keep the other ingredients as stated in the recipe. My family really enjoys this dish the few times I've made it.  My son enjoys this with a little syrup poured on top. It also reheats well and makes for a decent leftover.

I made exact to recipe.  You need to make this day before and refrigerate overnight.  Otherwise, it will not properly set.  I found this rather bland.  I think it is a good base recipe to add to.  Next time I will use 8x8 baking dish.  I used 8x10, and still too thin.

This was good but next time I will use a smaller pan. I followed the recipe exactly and it was too thin and a bit too dark for my finicky daughter although the flavor was very good. I see why other reviewers were happy using 6 or more eggs.

I have made versions of this for years and it is always a hit. I don't toast the bread, but often will leave the slices out to dry for a few hours. I also like the thicker Texas Toast instead of plain white bread, but any kind of non-sweet bread or rolls will work. Vary the kinds of sausage according to your mood; also, you can add things like sliced olives, diced tomatoes, mushrooms, chopped onions or scallions, and chopped or dried dill. I use 6 eggs and sometimes add salsa for part of the milk or cream or half-and-half. Or, make the casserole and serve the salsa and sour cream on the side. Particularly good with sliced black olives and onion in it!

My Son and his family love this casserole.  It is a must for when they are here for the holidays.   It is especially good topped with a Southern Style Sausage Gravy.   I add extra shredded cheddar on top for the last 15 minutes of baking.

Wow! This recipe was amazing. I did 1/2 of ground breakfast sausage and 1/4 pound of well cooked back that I crumbled into it. I also added diced potato's and my family absolutely loved it. This is going to be our new special breakfast treat! Highly recommend to all, though only as a special treat as it's not very healthy.

This is delicious, easy, and gives me something to do with that bread that's going a little stale...my husband is army and has pt in the morning and I tell you what when he gets home and sees this, he's always happy, a little hot sauce and he's a happy boy. Only thing is, it can be a little unpredictable on cooking time, but it's always yummy. Yay!

I made this in bulk and gave it away for Christmas gifts.  I was loved by all.  Didn't change anything except maybe adding more cheese.

It was delicious, and everyone else thought so too. I used croutons rather than soft bread, and a mix of cheeses (cheddar, mozzarella and monterey jack) so it wouldn't be so greasy. Aside from those small changes, I followed the recipe exactly and it was fabulous.

Great! What I liked best about this recipe was that the casserole baked up thinner than most breakfast casserole recipes. In my opinion, that made this casserole superior in that the whole thing cooked up evenly and remained moist and tender.  I think adding more eggs to this recipe would destroy the whole thing that makes it so great. It has been my experience that big, thick breakfast casseroles do not cook up evenly and half of the casserole is dried out and overdone while you bake it to death to cook the center! My go to now and I've tried a lot of these recipes.  Only thing I did different was use fresh Italian sausage and it added nice spice and flavor.

I used the maple sausage and we did not like it. I may try it again with regular sausage, but don't know yet.

This was delish!  I used hot sausage, added a couple more eggs, some aged sharp cheddar and green onion. Super easy, I will definitely make again.

My family said that this was the best Sausage Casserole they had ever eaten.  I substituted a few ingredients:  1 1/4 teaspoon mustard powder instead of 1, no salt, 8 eggs instead of 6, 1 box of Texas Toast Croutons Garlic & Butter instead of the 6 slices of bread.  I added my own touch by adding 1 small can of chopped green chilies.

I made a few adjustments and served it for Xmas brunch. It was a hit! I added 4 more eggs and an extra half teaspoon each of salt and mustard powder. I added 3/4 diced red bell pepper and 3 chopped green onions to add the colors of the holiday. I also used natural white Vermont cheddar instead of orange cheddar. The end result was delicious and I just made it again. We keep it in the fridge and heat slices for quick and easy breakfast on weekday mornings.  Keeps well in the fridge for 3-4 days.

I've made this recipe a couple of times now and have always been very pleased with the results.  I even made a double batch for work.  I work with 13 (male) engineers and they all loved it!  Their comment: "You can bring that anytime you want!"  If you can make 13 engineers happy, you've certainly got a winning recipe!

I made this, and it was the typical sausage and egg brunch casserole.  I added some sautéed onion and green pepper and mushroom, to jazz it up a bit for my own personal taste, but it's tasty and quite appealing to the eye as is.

This was WAY too DRY!  Made exactly to directions and seriously was almost inedible it was so dry. I didn't have time to read all 900+ reviews to see that almost everyone who gave the dish 5 stars had made major changes to the recipe.

I made this with frozen hashbrowns instead of bread. Made such a lovely casserole. Love the smell while it cooks. My husband's coworkers gobbled it up!

This was fantastic - a big hit with my entire family. I followed the directions to a "T", only making one substitution - which was to use a bag of croutons rather than the toast. Easy, tasty and filling.  I guess that meets all of the criteria! : )

This recipe was very good but I did change it a little. I used most of a 5 ounce bag of flavored croutons instead of plain bread. Also I used a square pan because if you used the 9x13 inch pan it would of been too thin. I would defiantly make this again.

This is an excellent recipe. It is great to have a dish you can prepare & leave in fridge to cook & serve fresh right out the oven without having to get up with the chickens. That being said, I have made it that way 5-6 times with great results but today I was pushed for time & wanted to bake right then to send @ 4am with my husband. I didn't let it sit in fridge @ all and I guessimated the ingredients, as usual it turned out perfect and tasty. I use the precooked Jimmy Deans sausage crumbles, just tear the bread & I had it prepared & in the oven in 10 minutes or less :) Try the recipe, its awesome! It is rich & definitely no health food :) but if you are looking to splurge on a cheesy, slightly eggy sausage dish try this one! Also it is able to be cut into squares & makes great lunch sandwiches :)

Not Xmas, but looked good online so I made it this morning since everyone is home this labor day. I made two of these and by time I found the phone to take the picture, only a small piece was left for me. I was a big hit, tasted great. Will for sure make again when everyone is home! Simple, quick and easy, and you can add so many other items to this as well.

Easy peasy.  I used whole wheat bread I had on hand and added three extra eggs and three extra pieces of toast to stretch it farther.  Plenty cheesy and sausagey that way, as well.

I like this casserole because it only calls for 4 eggs. I can never seem to get the more egg recipes to cook all the way through. This one comes out perfect every time.

have this sitting in my fridge right now and I cannot wait to try it again. I have a revised version on Christmas morning that was delicious and I asked for the recipe only to get she found it on here. So off I went to search for a recipe and came across this. I know this is a premature review but by the looks of what is in my fridge right now we will LOVE it! I took other reviewers advice and used 8 eggs, more milk and seasoned croutons. I came together in minutes. Thank you for such a simple recipe!

Perfect!  Used milk instead of cream... 9 pieces white bread toated and cubed and 8 eggs.  1 pound regular pork sausage and 8 oz sharp cheddar.  DELISH!!!

Very basic, very classic. Made as directed and we enjoyed it. My kids aren't big egg eaters so we liked that the eggs were only really to hold it together and it was more bread and sausage than egg.

OH MAN, this was soooo GOOD! I will definitely be making this more often.  I used 3 cups of unseasoned stuffing instead of toasting bread for convenience, and added a few spices.  I also didn't have any mustard powder so I used a tsp of Grey Poupon.  It was so easy to make and absolutely delicious.  I just wish it didn't take so long to cook!

My family enjoyed this dish but I think it can be improved.  I used sage sausage, added sauteed onions to the mix and replaced the milk with half and half.

I made this for my family for Christmas morning and it was soooo good!  I took a lot of reviewers' suggestions - did not use the mustard powder, used 6 eggs, 1 C of milk and 1/2 C of half and half, and added green onions. This may be a new tradition!

Great dish! I used 2 cup half and half instead of milk, 6 eggs instead of 4 and also 2 1/2 cups cheesy garlic croutons instead of bread I also used a combo of monterey jack and sharp cheese for cheeses and sprinkled some on top with 10 min left to cook and it turned out perfect, even one of my picky twins had 2 helpings!!

I'm just starting to really get into cooking so my culinary skills are just barely above basic. This is just as easy to prepare as the instructions make it sound. My husband & I ate it this morning & we both liked it. I read some of the reviews before preparing it & I did add 1 egg (total of 5) and did not include the salt (we usually leave salt out of recipes). Next time I make it, I'll probably add some veggies to it, like green peppers & onions...maybe a little tomato. I think it will still taste fantastic & be a more rounded breakfast.

This was great!! I added about 1/2 a cup of egg whites to it and it was really good. I also added about 1 1/2 tsp ranch seasoning mix. I will definitely be making this again! This is one recipe that you just can't go wrong with.

This is for those of you who forget to make this casserole the night before. I make it the day of serving and it tastes just as good.  The changes I make are 1/4 tsp salt, adding 1/4 tsp pepper, 6 eggs, 1 and 1/2 cups whole milk, 8 slices white bread, cubed and not toasted.  I also add scallions.
Chill 2-3 hours in the refrigerator and bake it in a 9x13 at 325 for 30min covered.  Then uncover and bake an additional 30min.
Always a hit - enjoy!

I thought this was delicious.  I'm not usually crazy over eggs, but I do like quiche, so I decided to try this recipe.  I'm glad I did because it's going into regular rotation for my family! I followed the recipe exactly as far as ingredient amounts, but I only had brown 'n serve sausage so I used that.  I sliced it up, browned it, and then added it.  Next time I might try making it with sausage and bacon both.  Two thumbs up!

Made this on Christmas morning and it was a huge hit and so very easy.  I used 7 eggs because we had a crowd.  It was perfect and you can add and change it up and it would still be a great breakfast dish.  And most of the ingredients we always have on hand.

Everyone really loved the recipe.  I liked that it could be made the night before and popped into the oven while everyone was opening presents.  By the time the presents were done, the casserole was ready.  I used breakfast sausages from the meat aisle and took off the casings.  I will make this an annual must-do

I decided to add 2 more eggs, a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes, and a touch of fresh ground pepper. I used light breakfast sausage and 2% milk cheese and it was still great! Used 2% milk instead of skim.

Easy and delicious. I used thick french bread slices. Although I got 8 servings out of it, I would say that they were 8 small servings. Not enough for 8 big eaters!

mmm, good!!! I will definitely be making this one again!!!  I used the maple sausage (just cuz that's what was in my freezer), 6 eggs, and 1 1/2 c. milk.  Turned out great!   Layered the bread, sausage, cheese, and then egg like one reviewer recommended.   was the first egg casserole i'd ever made, and it will be one that i will go back to and pass on the recipe:)

Very good casserole (and I am not a big egg casserole fan!) I did make a few minor adjustments and it turned out great! I used hot pork sausage instead of regular. I used "casserole" cheese instead of cheddar. I used 8 slices of white bread toast instead of 6. I was in a time crunch so I cooked it @ 400 degrees for 45 minutes (cover on) the for 5 additional minutes I took the cover off & sprinkled cheese on top. I let mine sit overnight like the recipe suggested, about 12 hours. Turned out great!

As most people have mentioned, this is a good basic recipe that's easy to personalize.  I used lite smokey links instead of ground sausage (no need to pre-cook, just dice and go!).  Mixed 6 eggs, salt, pepper, a tsp of ground mustard, a few dashes of Frank's Red Hot.  Added 6 pieces of untoasted wheat bread (crusts cut off, cut into 1 inch pieces).  Mixed in about a handful of colby jack cheese and put another cup or so on top.  Very good!  Didn't have a problem with it being soggy in the middle like I have with previous breakfast casseroles.

This is oh so rich and delicious.  I used cheese croutons instead of bread and probably more than 8 oz shredded cheese.  It was very easy to whip up on Christmas eve, then on Christmas morning the house smelled so yummy.  We ate it while sipping on mimosas and opening presents.  I only gave it four stars because it is almost TOO indulgent, I felt very "heavy" after eating a single serving.  But once a year a splurge is nice, and we will definitely be eating it again next Christmas!

This was wonderful! I did make a few changes. I added 2 tsp of onion powder (didn't have onions on hand) and 1 tsp of garlic powder.  I also added 1 more egg and 1 more cup of milk. It kept it really moist, the eggs were cooked perfectly and it had GREAT flavor! Definitely saving this one.

This was okay, but I think using shredded potatoes would have been better. I also think onion would've added some good flavor. I used maple flavored sausage which made it pretty sweet.

We all liked this recipe. I followed the suggestions of other reviews and added 2 additional eggs and it was really good. I also sprinkled cheese and a little bit of left over crumbled bacon (from potato soup last night) on top after uncovering and placing back in oven. I love that you put it together the night before and just throw it in the oven in the morning. This will work great and be well received when we have a huge crowd here Christmas Morning. Thanks for sharing!

It was alright.  This recipe really wasn't what I was expecting. Too airy.  I would have rather eaten a sausage cheese and egg biscuit and it probably would have been just as easy in regards to preparation time.  This will not be a do again.

This is my very favorite breakfast casserole!  My mom would make this every year for Christmas morning and Thanksgiving morning.  I am so happy to find the recipe!  And, this heats up well in the microwave.  I make it almost every week.  I take a slice to work for lunch.  I pair it with a mixed field greens salad and some fresh fruit.  It is a delicious, easy, healthy lunch option.

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I didn't think it was outstanding but I love the idea of making this ahead of time and then not having to cook in the morning.

I'm not a huge egg fan, but even I enjoyed this casserole. I did take someone's suggestion and used 1/2 cheddar 1/2 pepperjack cheese and added some green chiles. It definitely gave it a lot more flavor.

Simply superb!  My family LOVED IT!  Per some other folks' suggestions, I used Johnsonville maple sausage, Marie Calendar Chees & Garlic croutons, 6 eggs, and 2 cups of half & Half cream.  It was done after one hour @ 350!  Kept well for 2nd day breakfast!

This turned out great! I used 6 eggs and cut the milk down to 1 1/2 cups as others had suggested. I was short on time, so I ended up refrigerating for 45 minutes and freezing for 15 before putting it in the oven. The consistencey was fine! Thanks for a great recipe!

We have used basically the same recipe on Christmas morning for years!  The only real difference is we drizzle one can of CREAM OF MUSHROOM soup mixed with a little milk to loosen and drizzle over the top before baking.  We traditionally serve the brunch with curried fruit, cheese grits casserole and mimosa's...then go take a nap :)

I've made this recipe for years, with many variations.  Sometimes I take the time to brown frozen hash brown cut potatoes for the bottom layer.  I also have added mushrooms and/or frozen chopped spinach on top of the sausage.  I also tend to use a lot more eggs - 8 or more, depending on which variation I'm making.

Great starter recipe but if you are daring, change it up! I added cooked crumbled bacon onto the top and used american cheese instead cause I didn't have cheddar, and added minced purple onion!

Last night when I decided that I was going to make this I thought that I had everything on hand, so I had to make some changes.  I only had on hand sausage links so I cut them up and cooked them, but I also decided to add some bacon to the recipe and I used about 6 slices cut up.  After i cut up the toast to me it didn't look like enough for the family so I doubled the bread and as I did that I also added to eggs.  Other then that I kept it ingrediants the same I we all thoroughly enjoyed the recipe, there was none left.  People were going back for seconds and thirds

I made this but used 8 eggs and my store didn't have the maple flavored sausage so I drizzled maple syrup over the pork and bread and then added the eggs and cheese.  It turned out great and the syrup gave it a great smell while baking.

I used breakfast sausage links instead of ground pork.  I fried them up a little and then I prepared the casserole and just topped them w/ the links.  We had this for Christmas morning and it was very good.

My family loved this dish.  I did follow what others said and I actually double the eggs and added green and red pepper...  I should have left the cheese until the last 20 minutes..  Other than that they said it was a keeper!!

Unbelievable.  Easy to make and was delicious.  Made it Christmas Eve night, popped it in the oven and 1.5 hours later it was ready.

I made this for the first time on Christmas Eve.  I used Egg beaters, turkey sausage and lite wheat bread.  Woke up on Christmas morning and baked it for 45 minutes.  It was absolutely delicious and my family all asked if we could have this every year!  Thank you so much for sharing a great recipe!!

We made this Christmas Eve for Christmas morning and it was wonderful! I used an extra egg and put in finely chopped fresh thyme and sage.

Very good.  Used maple sausage and cooked it with 1/2 cup chopped onion.  6 eggs.  Also added 1/4 chopped parsley for color.  Even better warmed up as leftovers.

My family loved this on Christmas morning.  I did use egg beaters though instead of regular eggs.  Also my husband asked if the next time I make it if I will put onions in it.

I have made this casserole every Christmas morning since my kids were very small. This year, I considered making something different, but my three kids were horrified. This delicious and savory casserole has become as important a Christmas morning tradition as unwrapping gifts. It is easy to make, filling, and the perfect dish to offset all the sweets and cookies my kids inevitably eat throughout the morning. I have never modified the recipe - it is just right as is.

We just finished opening our Christmas gifts and eating this tasty casserole--I did take the suggestions of many fellow reviewers to make it perfect: layered in a smaller (8x10) pan, 6 eggs and 1 1/2 cups milk. All else stayed exactly the same, including cooking times. Very good and perfectly timed to bake while we opened presents--we won't just save this for the holidays, though!

I made this for my husband last night and he loved it! I did a few changes myself. I used 6 eggs, and used half a pound of maple sausage, and half a pound of maple bacon. I also added some chopped onions. I will definetly be making this again.

THis is really good and has become the Christmas morning tradition in our house.  I love being able to put it together the night before and having breakfast "make itself" Christmas morning while I'm busy watching the kiddos with their presents!  Our family doesn't eat pork so I make it with either turkey or beef sausage or even Gimmie Lean veggie sausage.  It always turns out just right.  YUM!

This turned out delicious! I used 7 eggs, 6 slices of toasted white bread and 1/8 cup more of milk than the recipe stated. I was out of mustard powder, so I used 2.5 teaspons of grey poupon mustard instead. I also used the organic pork sausage links from Whole Foods (365 brand) and cut the links into thin slices. Also, I added one small jar of red pimentos sprinkled on top before I put it all in the oven overnight -- it added great color. The guests loved it, the house smelled delicious while it baked and it tastes great reheated the next day (trust me, I'm eating a piece right now!).

Made this as stated, but to me it tasted doughy. I think my preference is using potatoes instead of toast in my breakfast casserole.

Definately use the white bread instead of wheat--we usually don't keep white on hand so I have used both in this recipe.  I don't know why but the wheat seems to dry the casserole out more.  Try this casserole--you won't be disappointed.

I made two casseroles using this recipe!  The first one I halved the  for my girls. The second one, I also halved  and used egg substitute (first time ever).  The girls came out better looking but both tasted good!  I was surprised that my girls liked it so much!!

This is de-licious!  We did not make it the day before, but rather the morning of and it was still good. I can see why you might want to prepare the day before - the bread crumbs would soak up the egg mixture and make it more dense (we found it to be plenty dense).  This makes a great "brunch" or late breakfast - it held us till dinner!  We  added a few ingredients: 1 medium chopped onion; 1 chopped red bell pepper(adds Christmas color!); chopped Thyme; ground pepper to taste; sprinkle with Paprika.  We also made the following modifications:  2 cups half and half instead of milk; 5 beaten eggs (not 4); 4 cups croutons instead of sliced white bread; substitute sharp cheddar for mild.  Next time we'll add chopped spinach or broccoli for more veggies and green/red color combination.  Definitely a recipe keeper!  Enjoy!

I served this Thanksgiving morning and everyone loved it. They have requested I make it for Christmas morning breakfast as well.  I like preparing in the day before, makes life much easier!  We had bagels with it and it was a great breakfast feast.  I didn't change a thing!

Very tasty.  You can pretty much add whatever you like.  I added chopped fresh spinach and orange peppers (I didn't have red) to get a little color.  I also added some dried basil and oregeno.

I made this when my in-laws visited this weekend and it all got eaten. However, next time I will probably make a few changes. It seemed a little too greasy and sausagey for my taste, so I might slightly reduce the amount of sausage and increase the bread by about 1 or 2 slices. Otherwise, yummy!

This recipe is awesome.  I made it for a breakfast for my son's kindergarten class.  It got rave reviews and many asked for the recipe.  No leftovers by adults or children.  I did not have time to let it sit in the refrigerator for 8 hours-My sat for 4 hours and still turned out beautiful!!  YUMMY!

I made this according to the recipe except that I only let it soak for twenty minutes before baking.  It turned out great!  We had it for a brunch themed bible study, and it dissapeared in no time flat.  I used spicy sausage, and that seemed to give it just the right amount of kick.  My husband liked it so much that he has requested that we have it for dinner one night soon.  I'll definitely be making this again soon.

Superb!  I added half a package of bacon chopped.  I used Sharp chedder cheese and half a bag of mild chedder cheese and 6 eggs to make up for the added cheese and bacon.  I made it for Christmas Breakfast and everyone loved it.

I made this recipe last year for Christmas, and it was a huge hit.  This year I made a LOT of substitutions...

Instead of 1lb of sausage, I used 1-1/2lbs crumbled bacon.
I added one 4.5oz jar of sliced mushrooms.
I used Medium Cheddar instead of mild.

I felt it came out a little too salty, but my Christmas crowd LOVED it!!!

Love this recipe! I made this last year for Christmas brunch & the family LOVED it! I like that I can make it the day before & I pop in the oven the next morning while we are opening presents! Definately gonna make it again this Christmas! I added chopped green onions & mushrooms to mine. This year I'm gonna also try adding red & green pimentos (or peppers) for a festive look & a little spice!

This is definitely worthy of the great reviews.  I made this to take to work during the holiday season - something different than the traditional sweets - and everyone loved it.  I will make this again and again.  I think it would be fantastic with a bit of onion added as well.

The only thing I added was a can of diced chiles and a little extra cheese on top before baking.  Otherwise I made this exactly as written and it turned out fantastic.  This recipe only made 6 servings for me, my husband and my company and that was with english muffins. Absolutely great!

This was pretty good.  I added some onion when cooking the sausage.  I did a mix of hot and sage sausages in mine.  All the guests really liked it (except for my 9 year old son - but he never likes anything!).   We will make this again/always for guests.  With the prep the night before, being able to drag out of bed and pop this in the oven while you come to your senses is just great!

This casserole was only okay...not great, as I expected it to be from all the 5-star reviews.  I followed the recipe exactly, and used spicy Italian sausage.  It was definitely edible, but just a little boring.  Next time I'll try adding other ingredients to make it more complex.

I took someone else's suggestion and doubled the recipe for a 9 x 13 casserole dish.  Excellent! Although I was afraid this was "another breakfast casserole" - this one will now be my keeper.  Company loved.  Thanks for sharing.

We loved this casserole!  I like to freeze leftovers in individual servings and just pop in the microwave for a great quick breakfast.  The only changes I made were to add some diced onion and some garlic powder.

I tried this again for Christmas and it was good. I think the first time I didn't bake it long enough. It was thin for a 9 x 13 so I think I'll use something a little smaller...but that may affect the baking time. Anyway, it was good.

Question...Has anyone cooked this the night before and oven warmed or microwaved it before serving?? I made one similar to this last Christmas and it was also delicious, but 1 1/2hrs is just a long time to wait for breakfast!

Considering all the wonderful reviews i've read on this dish...I must have goofed this up somehow.  It just came out way over done and i actually gave it to my dog.  I rated it 3 stars because i am figuring it must have me!!

This recipe tastes great, however, the cooktime is WAY too long! Mine was overdone at 45 minutes, so I did not leave it for additional cooktime.

I've made this for houseguests on 3 occasions and each time it's been a hit. Definitely the easiest breakfast meal that I've found that will feed 6-8 people. I omit the salt because the sausage and cheese contain plenty and I use 6-8 eggs and sharp cheddar.

This was just OK for me, I found it rather bland. My mother-in-law makes a fantastic sausage casserole & I was looking for something similar to taste (these ingredients were much like hers). Not that this was bad... but from all the outstanding reviews it got, I thought itd be better. So I tried to make this a second time, thinking I should add a little something extra to give it some more taste... I doubled this recipe & then added one whole onion & extra cheese. I liked this much more. I think I'll try adding crab next time as the previous reviewer suggested. That sounds YUMMY!

Please don't save this just for Christmas!  This would be a wonderful dish for Easter!  I didn't use the salt and added two more eggs.  My cooking time was 350 for 45 min. covered and then uncover and turn down to 325 for only about 10 more min.  Delicious!

We used 6 eggs, english muffin bread, and sharp cheddar cheese.  Very yummy.  I was surprised by how much was eaten on Christmas morning.  This is not diet food!

Wonderful!  My Mother also made a simular breakfast casserole every Christmas; one like this and another with pimentos.  Turned out perfect!  I used sourdough bread, as that is all I had on hand, and it was great!  I did not add salt, as the sausage seems to have enough.  Thanks M.K. Meredith!

This is the third Christmas of using this recipe.  I use sage sausage and splurge on gourmet extra sharp cheddar.  It is Christmas, after all!  I add more mustard powder and drain the sausage really well by draining all grease off into a jar and then putting it in a colander lined with a paper towel to sit for a minute.  Everyone always looks forward to the casserole!

Very tasty and easy to make!  I did not have mustard powder on hand so I used a teaspoon of regular yellow mustard and it was just the right flavor.  I took this casserole to my in-laws when they were moving and it was great to just put in the oven and forget it until it was done.  Has a great aroma while cooking!  Will become a staple casserole in my home, especially around the holidays!  Thanks M. K.!

I halved the recipe and baked in an 8x8 pan. I did not cook it as long either,covered or uncovered. I did add chopped onion to the sausage while it was cooking and left out the dry mustard since I was out of it.The second time I made it I didn't mix it up the night before...just let it sit for a little while for the bread to soak up the liquid...It was just as good!!!

Most of my family didn't care for this. I think its the quiche/egg casserole consistancy. I thought it was ok, needed more flavor. It still would be good for large get togethers or brunch.

I liked the fact I could prepare this the night before and just pop it right in the oven the next morning. This is destined to be a Christmas tradition. Next time I would like to try to substitute more low fat ingredients like turkey sausage.

I tried this one a few months ago. It didn't turn out quiet right. It was really soggy and didn't taste too good due to that. I probably did something wrong but do plan on giving it another attempt soon.

Very greasy.  Perhaps it would have helped to blot the sausage with paper towel and use reduced-fat cheese.  Probably will not make again.

I served this casserole at a brunch for my son's birthday. Everyone raved about it. A lot of real breakfast-lovers requested the recipe. Some of my family discussed plans to make the casserole with hot sausage, sage sausage, or maple sausage. I added no additional seasoning, but provided Tabasco sauce, salt and black pepper for those who were interested. I will be making this again!

This was awesome! I added sage to the sausage, and tore the toasted bread apart instead of cubing it. My fiancee who doesn't like eggs had 3 helpings, and my 15 month old ate it as well. Thanks for this yummy, yummy casserole recipe!!!

I added more sausage (because I love it), and sauteed some onions and a few jalapenos for some added kick.
To simplify things, I even used some croutons I had instead of the bread -- it worked great.
So...the great thing is that the recipe is easy - and adaptable. I proved you can "play around" with it and it still came out great.
A keeper!

Southwest/Tex-Mex Version:
Substitute cumin for dry mustard.
Saute small onion diced onion and add to mixture.  Use "hot" sausage instead of regular.  Substitue Monterey Jack cheese for cheddar.  Serve with bowls of salsa and sliced jalapenos.  You can also add green chilies to the mixture if you like that taste.

Delicious.  I doubled the recipe and followed the suggestion of the recipe submitter and used 1 regular sausage and 1 sage sausage.  I took this for Christmas morning brunch and there was nothing left.  Will make again.

I doubled the recipe and added some chopped red & green bell pepper and a little grated onion for flavor and took to my daughter's for Christmas morning.  It was a great hit, especially with everyone, especially the men who all went back for seconds!  Great Recipe.

Fabulous Recipe.  Made it christmas morning and was a tremendous hit.  I used Jimmy Dean's Maple  sausage instead of the regular sausage and it added such a wonderful taste to the recipe.  Also used 8 eggs instead of the 4 that the recipe called for.  This is a "two thumbs up" recipe and I will be making this again and again.

I made it this morning and it was fabulous!  It was so pretty - should be on the front of a magazine.   I loved the fact that you can make it the night before.  I did increase the eggs to 8 as one of the other reviewers suggested and it still turned out great.

Great. We enjoyed it thoroughly. We had it for dinner. I made it in the am and refridgerated it all day. One tip-it was a bit salty. Next time I will eliminate that 1/2 tsp of salt. Thanks

I cook sausage with onions, bell peppers, and garlic 

I add tomatoes into the casserole before chilling and then top with cheese, tomatoes, and chopped scallions.

I don't have any idea how many times I have made this recipe, and while it is never exactly the same, it is always welcome and delicious.  Normally I toast the bread because, hey, toast.  Onions, bacon or sausage, or sometimes ham, eggs and the cheese always depends on my immediate mood.  I prefer pepper jack, but others want a milder flavor for breakfast, and i have been known to add cheddar or cojack to one side and pepper jack to the other.   I use fresh herbs as much as possible, and always use thyme, as it was created, in my opinion, to live with eggs.  I have done this in a slow cooker, in the oven, and in a one pot, and love love love it.  I hope you do too.

This is another Christmas morning favorite for our family. It's so easy to make the night before and then just pop in the oven Christmas morning. It's great for leftovers, too - although  it's a rare occasion that there's anything left in the dish.

This is the most versatile recipe ever!  Use ham, Swiss cheese and rye bread or beef, cheddar, and a dark heavy bread or ground beef, Mexican blend of cheeses and cornmeal, egg and milk mixture. Use whatever meat, cheese and bread you have on hand. Fiddle with the spices. It comes out great time after time.

This is a wonderful recipe. - have been using it for about 30 years.  It doesn’t take anywhere near that long to bake, though,  I bake it for about 40 minutes at 375 uncovered the whole time.  It does better to let it sit for about 5 minutes before eating.  It’s also  my family’s  traditional Christmas breakfast dish.

I use 6 eggs and mix white and wheat bread. My mom always made it for Easter brunch but I make it regularly! Too good to only have once a year. My 3 sons often request it for dinner as well.  It brings my college age son home every time!

I took the suggestions of a couple other reviews. I buttered my 9x13 glass casserole dish instead of greasing it. Covered the bottom of the dish with slices of bread. No need toast, cube, etc. Browned bulk sage breakfast sausage well. Sprinkled it over the bread, topped with 1/2 an 8oz pkg shredded cheddar, whisked 6 eggs with 3/4 cup heavy cream, 3/4 cup 1% milk and salt & pepper, poured over cheese & topped with the rest of the cheese. Covered with plastic wrap, refrigerated for 8 hrs, baked for 35 min at 350. Came out perfect!! Crispy edges & nicely browned top. This is a keeper.

I've been making a dish similar to this for Christmas morning for several years and we absolutely LOVE it!!! I brown the sausage with mushrooms, onions and bell peppers.  I generally don't add as much milk (more like 1 1/4-1 1/2C). I also use the cubed frozen hash brown potatoes instead of the bread cubes as another poster here mentioned. It really does make a huge difference!!!!

I also, sprinkle a little chopped green onion on top with some cheese.

YUMMM!!!!

I made this ahead of time to warm up on Christmas morning, but my taste of it was delicious.  I didn't change anything, but might have put in more cheese than was intended (and would do it again) because I weighed out the eight ounces called for, and it looked like about three cups grated, even when I didn't use all the cheese.  I thought toasting the bread really added some depth of flavor that untoasted bread wouldn't have.

This recipe is almost identical to one we've made dozens of times over the past 30 years. Key differences: use herb stuffing mix instead of toasted cubes, adds more flavor; top it in the morning before baking with a can of cream of mushroom soup, diluted with 1/2 can of milk. Bake at 300-325 1-1/2 hours.

This is an old Betty Crocker recipe that I discovered in the 70's. I've been making this for Christmas breakfast every year since. I usually buy an extra bag of soft (fresh bread) cubes at Thanksgiving and freeze it for this recipe (cuts down on time) I double the sausage, add a bit of minced onion and extra cheese, I'll often do half milk and half 1/2 & 1/2 (say that 3 times fast) and extra egg or two then put it all in a 13x9 pan. But it's good as-written too! My daughter now makes it for my grandson - and the tradition continues on!

I've done a smaller version on the stove on a hot butter greased skillet and pouring ingredients into a 3.5  in. round steel biscuit cutter. Instead of using bread I use boxed instant potato, mixing all ingredients into a thick paste. 
I live alone so its great for single servings.

I make this every Christmas Eve.  I don’t bake it until the kids get up on Christmas morning. Once they are up I put it in the oven and it’s done once all the presents are opened.  I also add green chilies. Sometimes I use hash browns instead of the bread. Either way it’s delicious!

I have made this many times and it is always a five star recipe.  You just can't go wrong.  However, the original recipe that was given to me years ago has one extra ingredient that I never see in anyone's version of this recipe and that is to spread a can of cream of mushroom soup (very slightly diluted with a small amount of milk) over the top.  It just adds an interesting richness.  But the fact that you make this the night before and just stick it in the oven the next morning makes it a winner on many fronts!

I got several compliments on this dish aster taking it to a Christmas brunch.  After reading several reviews, I did make adjustments- 8 eggs, 2 c. Milk, 1/2 c. green onions, 12 oz. package of maple sausage links cooked then cut up, 1/2 or more of large bags of OreIda hashed browns.  I used the same amounts of cheese, mustard and salt but added 1/2 t. Pepper.  It’s a keeper!

This is actually the same basic recipe that has been handed down for years in the African American community as a gift to families grieving the death of a loved one. In this version the ingredients are layered like a strata, bread first, then sausage, cheese and milk, egg mixture poured over all.
I've used bulk Italian chicken sausage, Italian bread,  Colby and jack cheeses, and  seasoned  egg/milk with a pinch of white pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. Eliminate the salt, since sausage is generally salty enough. Preheat the oven to °400F (since the pan is coming straight from the fridge), then turn it down to °350F.
My local Whole Foods has a bulk veal chorizo, which I've used with Mexican cheese mix and adobo seasoning.

I admit that I did make changes, but I gave the recipe 4 stars because it a great base for this type of casserole. 

I found a great product called Jimmy Dean Meat Lovers Sausage and Bacon Crumbles. 

It comes in the refrigerated deli section in a pouch and eliminates all the time and mess it takes to brown sausage. I used two of these pouches. The pouches also come in regular sausage and turkey sausage.  I will experiment later using the turkey sausage and egg whites to lighten things up.

 Based on other reviews I read, I made the following changes:

 I lined the bottom of a 9 X 13 pan with regular loaf bread slices. I happened to have oat bread, but you could use wheat or whatever you have on hand. I didn't toast them or anything.

I used 10 eggs and 1.5 cups of half and half. I think whole milk would have been fine. The key to a fluffy, perfect consistency is to combine the eggs, milk, and seasoning in a mixing bowl and beat until fluffy. It's worth the extra step. I will never make another egg casserole without beating the eggs. Make sure to refrigerate overnight and bake the designated amount of time. If you pull out the casserole, and it is not firm, put it back in the oven until the dish is good and brown. Let is set about 10 minutes on the counter before you serve .

 My husband's friends were here for the weekend, and they absolutely loved this dish.

Christmas breakfast turned out great! All 5 of us were fed well, and we had some leftovers. We doubled this recipe to make sure it would be thick enough in our 9x13 pan. Used 1lb of sage and 1lb of regular sausage, 12 eggs, 2 cups of milk and 1 cup of half and half, 3 bags of garlic/cheese croutons, and about 12 ounces of shredded mixed cheese. Just like others suggested we layered the pan like a lasagna with the croutons on the bottom, then the sausage, the cheese was layered next, then we poured the eggs over everything. We diced up 2 jalapeños (seeded) and sprinkled them on top of everything. Left in the refrigerator over night and pulled it out the next morning while the oven preheated to 350. Baked covered for an hour and another 30 minutes uncovered. Delicious!! Definitely will make this again.

Are you sure we're not siblings?? lol MY mom, now in her 80's,  ALSO makes this every year! I made one last week as I discovered a roll of sausage in the freezer. I just wanted to mention that since I had no bread cubes I toasted several slices of rye bread I had and cubed them and it sure added some nice flavor, the rye! Also my family  puts 1 lb  crumbled bacon and one lb sausage.  Lipitor, anyone??!

I made this for a small group of friends and we all loved it and enjoyed seconds! Small changes I made were using a 10" diameter casserole dish, one cup of half&half & one cup of low-fat milk instead of 2 C of milk,  sausage and bacon for the meat, and included a tsp of hot sauce. Planning to make it again for Christmas.

I doubled it for the 13x9 pan.  I added green onion, substituted hash brown potatoes for the bread,  cut the amount of half-half by 1/2., and added a bit more grated cheese to the top during the last 15 minutes.  It is an excellent recipe, especially because you can prepare it the night before.  Thank you  - this is a keeper!!

Wow this was great! I made this the day beforehand to use for a bridal shower brunch, and it turned out excellent! After making according to the directions (except using 1 cup of half and half and 1 cup of milk, as well as 6 small eggs), I did add more bread since I felt it looked flat. I ended up using a total of 10 slices of normal white bread. I probably could have added more milk to compensate for the bread. Baked as directed for 45 minutes, but it was totally set and browned at that point, so I did not cook for the additional time. Super easy to make!

I have made this twice now and it has been perfect each time! It was a big hit on Christmas morning. I used Jimmy dean maple sausage, added in green onion to the mixture, used 6 eggs, and only used 1 1/2 cups of milk. I didn't want it to get too soggy with 2 cups of milk. Will definitely make it again!

I used leftover dinner rolls and ended up adding 3 extra eggs. This was a hit with my family! Definitely do not forget to spray or grease the pan before baking. I forgot and the clean up was pretty stuck on.

This is a great  Holiday family favorite! The recipe is wonderful as it is and it's so easy to swap out different flavored ingredients, add seasoning, vegetables, etc. I've always doubled the recipe and still used the 9 x 13 pan, this makes for a dense end result but it is soooo of good!

When I made this I needed to feed more people, so I used 8 eggs instead of 4.  Another slight change was adding about  1/2 C. chopped onion, cooking along with the sausage. When the sausage and onion were almost done, I added about 1  1/2  C.  coarsely chopped spinach, stirring and cooking for about 2 more minutes.  It turned out very well and I'll be making it again soon.

I made this exactly like the directions said to make it. Although I was slightly skeptical (due to soaking toast overnight) I gave it a go and was more than pleasantly surprised. It was a huge hit on Christmas morning and such a blessing to not be distracted with cooking on Christmas morning. Our six year old loved it as did everyone!  Thank you!!!!

This is fantastic!  I did what some other people suggested and used a bag of croutons and 2 cups of half and half and 7 eggs.  I also used spicy breakfast sausages. It was so good!  My family gobbled it up.  This will definitely be a new tradition for us every Christmas morning!

DE. LISH.  OMG.  SO GOOD!
Okay, so I didn't use bread.  I cooked up some hash browns in olive oil and placed them on the bottom and then put the sausage/egg/cheese mixture on top.  I also added 3 Tbsp of green onions because that sounded so good (it was!) and refrigerated it overnight.  My husband LOVED it and so did I.  No question, I will make this again.  Also, I used hot Italian sausage, fyi.  Happy Cooking and Thanks for the recipe!

I'm not going to be making this one, because although it's a good start (and it's really close to something I've been making for decades), what's missing here is *flavour*!

1)  1 tsp mustard powder?   Nope.   1.5 tsp fresh-ground mustard seeds.
2)  4 eggs?  Try 5... you'll need them for the rest.
3) 2 cups of milk???   Might as well use water!   1.5 cups 18% coffee cream, and half a cup of 35% whipping cream.  This isn't a diet omelette, it's a luxury brunch feature.
4) add an extra slice of bread, and turn all the bread into half-inch croutons before you start.
5) 8 oz of MILD cheddar?!?!?  NO!   Oh, I'll grant the quantity's right, but you want half a pound of the oldest, sharpest cheddar you can possibly get your hands on:  anything less will be totally hidden by the flavours of sausage and mustard.
6) oh, and cut the salt in half:  the sausage meat and cheese have PLENTY of that stuff.   :-)

For the last 20 minutes, I add corn flakes (stirred in butter) to the top. Gives it an amazing crispy finish. 1/2-3/4 cup plain corn flakes (1/2 stick butter), with cover it nicely.

I liked it,  I used maple sausage but if were to make it again I would just use plain sausage.  I felt like the maple made it too sweet.  It turned out just like the picture.

Our family has made this same exact recipe every Christmas as well.   We all love it and it's a great tradition. We don't mess with this recipe's ingredients and make it as listed, although these helpful hints are things we learned the hard way along the way:   1.  Always use a glass baking pan!   A metal pan unfortunately leaves a metal taste in the casserole.   Covering with foil is not a problem because it doesn't really touch the mixture.  2.  You can use white or wheat bread, but we highly recommend NOT using a whole grain bread.  Seeds and such are an odd texture to run across in this particular casserole.  3.  Definitely let it sit overnight before baking.    Hope you all enjoy as much as our family does.  Love seeing it called Christmas Casserole.

Rave reviews on this casserole.  Next time I'm doubling the recipe...everyone went back for seconds.  Changes I made included using spicy brown mustard instead of mustard powder, 8 slices toasted bread and I used  ground pork that I cooked with my own concoction of "spicy sausage" spices instead of prepared sausage.    I also added sauteed onions, garlic, green onions, and leek to the egg mixture.  I only added about 1/2 the cheese suggested and it was still amazing and delicious.  I had 4 people ask for the recipe and my family definitely wants it again too!

AMAZING! I followed other reviewers and increased eggs to 10, (could even have used more maybe?)  used 2C half and half. LAYERED: 6 sliced Texas toast on bottom of 9x13, then 1 lb sausage, then 8 oz cheese, then milk mixture. 45 min at 350 covered, 20 min at 325 uncovered. Everyone devoured it--No leftovers!!

A excellent basic recipe.  A little too bland for my family.  I made some changes.  I used 6 leftover dinner rolls. Sliced and toasted them.  I used 6 eggs instead of 4, reduced the milk to 1 cup, added 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper, 1/4 teaspoon fresh ground pepper and omitted the salt. Added the cheddar cheese, cooked and crumbled Jimmy Dean sausage and 1/4 cup of green onions.  It was delicious.

Great recipe, but I make a few changes to it that I think have improved it.  First, I use half heavy cream half milk instead of all milk; I use 6 eggs instead of 4; I add some extra spices to the egg/milk mix (I put pepper, garlic, parsley, sage, etc.): instead of toasted bread I actually use croutons, I have found they stay crunchy better than the bread, which got soggy the first time I made it: and finally I top it off with potatoes and cheese and some green onion… I use the frozen diced potatoes with peppers and onions.  I also broil it for a few minutes at the end to make sure the potatoes come out crispy.  I also don’t put the potatoes on until right before it goes in the oven… I follow the recipe and then put the whole thing in the fridge overnight to let everything meld together.  In the morning, toss on the taters and cheese and green onion and put it in the oven.  Awesome for the holidays or cold winter mornings 

Also, if you’re really short on prep time the day before, I have used the pre-cooked sausage patties or sausage crumbles from the grocery store instead of buying raw sausage and cooking it myself.  I think it actually tasted better and took so much less time!

I've made this several times and incorporated several suggestions from other reviewers. It has become our Thanksgiving Breakfast Casserole.  After several alterations we have settled on the following changes:  1.  substitute about 3/4-1 bag of seasoned croutons for half of the bread, 2.  Add a 4 oz can of chopped green chiles (tried jalapeños but found they took over) 3.  Substitute at least half of the cheddar with pepper jack 4. Use 6 eggs 5.  I use turkey sausage instead of pork sausage (just a personal preference...and it is thanksgiving).

The best for morning company! For a 10x14 dish, I used 10 eggs, 1 1/2 cups milk, and a 6oz. bag of Reese cheddar cheese croutons (plus the rest of ingredients). Just the right proportion of egg and sausage. NEXT Time: added sautéed onion, tastey! Don't overbake or it will be dry.

I love this recipe because its so versatile, keep it basic or jazz it up.  I use spicy sausage for a little kick, and add in whatever I have on hand that I have a taste for...mushrooms, a bit of diced onions, whatever! Plus when company or holidays are involved, I love anything that can be made ahead of time - just pop it in the oven the morning of...no mess, no fuss!

We decided to try this recipe today, instead of our usual strata (Best of Bridge's: Christmas Morning Wifesaver). This was just o.k.  Rather than trying to adjust this recipe, I think we will just go back to what we love.

I made this and our family loved it.  I used 6 slices of bread torn into pieces.  I used 1 cup of  1/2 & 1/2 and 1 cup of milk.  I used green onions within the casserole as well as some on top for contrast.  I baked it 45 minutes covered and about 15 minutes uncovered.

Delicious.  Used half a loaf of sourdough bread and ripped into pieces, then toasted in the oven for a little bit.  Was very good!

Started with the basic recipe, and tend to agree with other reviewers that seems soggy, with extra water/milk in the bottom of pan, especially with white bread. Next time probably cutting milk by half a cup and adding a couple extra eggs for firmer egg texture, though this may be improved with a firmer bread, perhaps a French or Italian style loaf

Served this for Christmas brunch, and it was wonderful.  The casserole was 5 stars, but I am giving the recipe as written 4 because I took several suggestions from other reviewers (used croutons instead of bread and used 8 eggs).  This will be a new Christmas tradition.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe using the suggestions of other reviewers. I increased eggs to 6, and decreased milk to 1-1/2 cups.  Other than that, I follwed recipe instructions. My family was just so-so on this. It seemed very "bready" even with the extra eggs.
It was OK for Christmas morning, but I am still looking for the perfect Christmas morning casserole.

As other reviewer's have stated.

Amazing recipe!
I followed some hints offered by others......Thanks!
Doubled the Mustard, used six eggs....used a 7x10 pan...fits perfectly

Nice thing about this recipe is you can alter as you see fit!
I used 2 slices white bread, 2 slices wheat bread and through in some seasoned croutons.  Also altered milk to 1 cup plus thru in half a cup of whipping cream, (all I had lol).

I'm going to do all seasoned croutons next time

One of the best, quickest heartiest recipes on this site!
Thanks Much for the recipe all the hints from reviewers!!!

Good!   Nice to make it the night before, and just pop it in the oven next day.  Following suggestions of others, I used the maple flavored sausage, 6 eggs, and just 1 cup of half and half - might use a little more the next time.  I used sourdough bread, just left out to dry all day.  I baked in a 12" round quiche pan, which was just the right size.  I was a little surprised that the bread kind of disappeared .... tasted good, but I think I expected the bread to be more obvious!  We aren't big cheese fans, so I cut back on the cheese, using about half the amount in with the eggs and sausage, and a little more sprinkled on top.  Enjoyed it with just a touch of real maple syrup on top!  Had leftovers today, and it reheated well in the microwave.   This made about 6 servings for us.   (I generally don't make so many changes, but as others have mentioned, this is a good base recipe that can be customized to your taste - wanted to note changes for my own purposes for the next time!)

We really liked this with my tweaking.  Added onion and used "hot" sausage.  The only other thing I might change is use hashbrowns instead of the bread next time.

Delicious.  I doubled the batch, used extra cheese (sharp), added crumbled bacon, and mixed Jimmy Dean's sage sausage with Jimmy Dean regular.  I also cut nice thick slices of French bread to toast.   My family loved it!

Turned out great. Everyone really liked it. I used a french bread baguette instead of regular white bread. I think this helped to make the casserole texture a bit more light and airy. Simple and delicious!

I fixed this exactly to the directions...UNTIL...I got up this morning and looked at it. I had homemade bread vs. store bought and 6 slices were too much - it looked like it would dry out, so I mixed another egg with some milk and poured over the top. I also topped it off with some mixed peppers and onions that I had in the freezer just because I thought it looked plain. I baked it exactly as directed and invited some of my apartment neighbors to stop for a plate and it got the thumbs up all around. I love this. This was delicious and I will be making it every Christmas morning from now on! Thank you!

A huge hit with my big appetite family! Two changes- I put in 5 eggs instead of 4, and  used a 9.6 ounce package of Jimmy Dean fully cooked Original Pork Sausage Crumbles instead of frying fresh sausage. Amazingly delicious and perfect for Christmas or any morning.  The recipe fed just four of us, so you might want to make more pans of it to serve more people.

I've made this recipe, exactly as it is writeen, for our annual Christmas morning breakfast with all of the family for the last several years and it is always a hit.  Everyone looks forward to it because it is the only time that I make it.  The only thing I've had to do over the years is double the recipe and bake in a big foil pan as the size of our family has grown!

Very easy and good recipe. I added some bacon and a herb mix I use often to make it more suitable to our taste. This is a keeper.

Made this last weekend for a early family Thanksgiving breakfast. Everyone loved it. I didn't let it soak over night or even 8 hours and it was still very good.

I've used a very similar  recipe that has been in my family for many years.. Handed down from the South!  We like Leah use half/ half (1-1/2 cup) instead of whole milk. We use sharp cheddar cheese ( 9 to 16 oz) the more cheese the better for us. Wheat or white bread ...buttered on one side (UN- toasted) place buttered side down when putting in pan. 

We are meat lovers so we double meat (Sage Sausage Only)...better flavor...Or we do one side Sage sausage (1lb), one side thick sliced bacon (1lb). The last difference is we add black pepper (1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon) along with salt, and mustard powder. Follow the same instructions..And add your own flare to it!

I make this casserole, or other versions of it, at least once a week. You can change up the sausage and sub with bacon, ham, throw in tomatoes and mushrooms, or anything else that you feel is good and what's handy.  Since my hubby and I are empty nesters, I will adjust the recipe for six.  There is never anything left over! Yum!

I just made this recipe and was not impressed. Smelled amazing but did not have much flavor. I made exactly as directed. The center was moist but the edges and bottom were pretty tough. That is a pretty long cook time too for all that it is. I just figured if ya have to change a recipe that much to make it how ya like it, you might as well try another one or just make your own.

I loved this recipe!  I didn't use dry mustard because it tends to have an ashtray aftertaste but I used a little regular mustard,one extra egg and I crumbled three pieces of Bacon on top to make it even more "heart attack " good...sooo awesome!

I read a lot of the other reviews and got paranoid that this thing would be flat and flavorless, so I did add 2 extra eggs and some grated fresh onion.  My changes were delicious but I bet the original recipe is great if you really follow it.  The ground mustard is key to de-bland-ifying it, and toasting the bread is imperative for avoiding a gross mush-fest.  Also be sure to use pork SAUSAGE, which is spiced, as opposed to plain ground pork -- or add your own spices if you're using plain pork.  

My only caveat is I'd say make this one even further ahead than the recommendation, since it takes 90 minutes to bake (which is about 75 minutes longer than I like to wait for my breakfast on Christmas or any morning).  

Anyway, thumbs way up.  Delicious, hearty, filling!

A good base recipe but we all felt it needed something more.  I want to try it with the garlic croutons instead of bread and I think adding some green chili would be good.

My husband and I both liked this recipe a lot. Good for when you have guests over. Used Jimmy Dean maple sausage, added yellow onion to sausage while it cooked, and used 6 eggs instead of 4. I used french bread and the casserole still cake out thick and more than enough for us in a 9x13 pan. Baked covered for 35 min and uncovered for 15. Thanks for the recipe!

I made it for a brunch and everyone loved it. I used turkey sausage, 6 eggs, garlic & cheese croutons (instead if white bread) plus added a small onion, green pepper and red pepper. I sauteed the veggies with the sausage as it was browning.

This recipe is awesome!!  Made it for the 1st time this 2013 Christmas breakfast with organic stone ground yellow grits and it was perfect!  Our daughter and son in law are expecting their 1st child in May and due to their  meticulous eating habits of organic eating I changed up the recipe just a bit to 
make it healthier by using turkey sausage, organic milk & eggs. I also added some sweet chopped onions and portabella mushrooms.    It was delicious!  You will not be disappointed in this recipe.

I made changes based on personal preference and suggestions on the site... I used Owens "hot" sausage and browned it with a cut up red onion. After it was browned I added a half a bag of baby spinach (might add a whole bag next time). 
For the egg mixture I used 6 eggs and 2 cups of milk. I used a little more ground mustard than called for (just a dash more). The BIG difference is using the CHEDDAR GARLIC CROUTONS instead of the bread. I used a bag and a half...It adds soooo much to the dish. I think the other reviews that complain of it being "bland" need to try this recommendation. It makes a huge difference!!

Made this Christmas Eve and it was delicious!  I made it exactly as the recipe called for, but doubling it.  It was not soggy at all w/ the milk- it was perfect!!  Doubling the recipe makes it perfect for a 9x13 pan.  The only thing I would do (and did) was increase the temp, not decrease it.  I turned it up to 400 for 30 min & it was a golden brown on top.  I agree you can add anything you want to it....bacon, spinach, mushrooms.  I will definitely make it again.

This was really good, and I usually don't like egg casseroles with bread in them. I gave 4 stars because next time I would use more eggs (6) and less milk (1c).

A good recipe. I changed it a bit. As others suggested used a deeper dish, 6 eggs and breakfast links. Cut the links up and cooked them, used half and half a dash of garlic salt and thinly sliced onion. Mixed us the egg mixture added spices plus, garlic salt and a bit of Mrs Dash. In a greased dish I put a layer of seasoned croutons, layer of sausage, layer of onion rings, poured half egg mixture over top then layer of cheese, start layer again. Looked great coming out of oven!

My family and I both love this recipe! We make this every Christmas morning and it is a tradition every year for the last 4 years. I really don't change anything it is great just the way it is. The only thing we change is we double the recipe and add green onion. Try this and you will make it for your family too. Merry Christmas Americans.

I thought this would be good but it was awesome.  Fluffy but filling, amazing taste, and easy to make. I made it with sage sausage, six eggs, one cup of half-and-half, and thick cubes of white bread, untoasted. I also added a spoonful of Dijon mustard.  New Christmas Eve morning tradition!

Thanks for making me a Sunday morning hero!  Couldn't wait for Christmas, so made it for Sunday morning.  The only substitution was Texas Toast seasoned croutons instead of bread.  The smell woke everyone up; no Mom alarm needed.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I've made this casserole for the past three Christmas mornings. I use chorizo sausage, sharp cheddar and dried out Italian bread. Last year I added the green onions. I have also increased the number of eggs to six. Everyone loves it.

I'm going to make this for Christmas morning breakfast but, since one of my children does not eat pork, I will substitute mushrooms for the sausage and perhaps add some additional seasonings to make up the flavor.  I think I'd rather have mushrooms than fake sausage since the reviews i've read for them are not favorable.  I'll let you know how it turns out.  Difficult to rate since I haven't tried it but will give it 4 stars since everyone else seems to love it.

I made the recipe as is and wasn't impressed. The casserole turned out soggy and didn't have much flavor at all. If I decide to try again, I will go with some of the others suggestions. But as is, no I would not make again.

I made this pretty much as directed and it turned out good.  My fault that I accidently bumped the oven temp to 450 degrees, so the bottom and edges were very brown and dried out, but we were able to scoop out the "insides" and were still very good.  Make again, but watch the oven dial!

This was a good casserole and tasted great, but was much smaller than what I had expected.  It safely serves four adults. Thanks!

Best breakfast casserole! Made this for an Easter brunch and everyone loved it. I used Jimmy Dean Hot sausage. I didn't realize it was an overnight dish until the morning I needed it, but it still worked great. Combined everything and put it in the freezer for 1/2 hour. Baked up beautifully.

FOR A GREAT TWIST!!! Substitute the cheese for Pepper Jack , and add a diced onion. It adds a new element (JUST a touch of heat), and the kids love it too. If made this way, it is our tradition for Christmas and Easter mornings!

This is a great base recepie that you can customize to any taste! My custom changes: to add a 'crust' get a pillsbury crossant package, and unroll the whole package and place it on the bottom of your 9x13 (after using your favorite non-stick spray). Its great for vegitarians also, I used diced veggies & boca 'veggie crumbles' instead of sausage and it was a HIT! Have fun with it!

I've also tried the Charleston Breakfast Casserole recipe here on the site and that recipe is NOTHING compared to this. I'm 37 weeks pregnant and this is the second time I'm making this in less than a month, because the first time - I ate this every single morning until it was gone. So delicious and easy (minus the cook time, bit of a hassle.) I will say that I followed all of Jen P.'s advice in the reviews. So perfect that way!! Thanks poster and Jen P!! :)

My mom made this for years at the holidays and it saved on all the mess on Christmas morning.I have been making this recipe with some changes for years. I used wheat bread this year and egg beaters instead of the whole egg. I also added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup. I use 9 eggs or equivalent egg beaters and 2lbs of sausage (drained) and 4 cups of milk. I may try the croutons. It will save time breaking up the bread.

Made this Christmas morning-such a hit!  I read the reviews, and made the similar changes.  I layered the bottom with toasted Texas toast.  I added one bell pepper and onion (sauteed) to the egg mixture.  I used breakfast turkey sausage.  I used 1 cup half'n half instead of 2 cups milk.  And I used a smaller dish-9 x9.  The result?  Every bite gone!

I liked this recipe.  Not sure I would have liked it if I'd left it the way it is.  I added 1 1/2 cups of milk instead of the 2 cups stated.  I also added a Mexican blend cheese and about 2 tablespoons of green chiles.  I think next time I make this I will be adding the entire little can of green chiles.  It was still a little bland for my taste.  Overall though, I definitely liked it and would make it again.

I have used this recipe for holiday breakfasts/brunches for years and everyone likes it. What makes it so good is it's simplicity, yet great flavor. I add onion when I cook the sausage and double the recipe.  Actually, I don't really measure anything.  As long as the bread cubes have been covered by the egg mixture, it'll be good.  You can't mess it up.  That's 5 star quality when you have a house full with you as you are trying to prepare! Egg, bread, and meat...add a fruit salad and it works!!

This recipe was totally fine as written, ignore the reviews that say it was too bland or that completely changed it up to make it "better". The only change I made based on prior reviews was to use 2 cups of half and half (and it was not too wet and mushy, per the people who said to cut the milk down), and that is only because I had leftover that I needed to get rid of. I used mild Italian sausage and pre-packaged white bread stuffing cubes.

took the other cook's reviews and adapted my own - used 6 eggs, added green pepper and mushrooms. Also used low fat sausage and whole wheat as the bread. This turned out very nice, a little bit dryer than I'd like. Next time I might use the full 8 eggs that others used.

This was wonderful! I made it for Christmas morning, but forgot to make it the night before, so it only had about 1/2 hour in the fridge.  It still tasted great.  In a 13 x 9 pan, it was a little thinner than I expected (of course that may have been different if I followed the recipe, right?)

I made the mistake of adding cooked bacon along with the sausage. It made the casserole too salty. Next time sausage only! Great recipe, easy to make and it's nice that it can be made ahead with all the other preparations I had to do with the holidays.

I tried this for the first time on Christmas morning, with the revamping suggested by Leah Joy; 7 eggs, 6 slices of cubed sourdough toast on the bottom of the pan, and a few green onions in the milk/egg mixture. Everyone loved it!  This is my new favorite breakfast casserole, easily replacing the old one with frozen hash browns on the bottom!!

Every family is different and every family has different tastes.  I followed the recipes as written.  Based on other reviews, I used Jimmy Dean's maple flavored sausage.  I will NOT use a flavored sausage the next time I fix this casserole.

This seems to be a good basic recipe, but it needs "something."  One reviewer suggested serving with salsa or sour cream.  I think that would help.  Other reviewers suggest green onions; having tasted the recipe as written, I think that would help it also. 

 For those families who like a sweet taste, I think you could just let the kids pour maple syrup on it.  That way, adults could make spicier additions to their plate, and kids could add a sweet kick on their plate.

This is seriously the BEST egg anything I have ever tried, cooked and eaten!  Definitely going into my potluck arsenal and will be a new breakfast tradition at Christmas.  I didn't have milk and so I use whipping cream, added a few more eggs and used maple sausage as suggested.  It was a huge hit! Not dry...not soggy...fluffy and moist deliciousness that I couldn't stop eating!

Thanks for sharing!

This was a really good recepie! I attempt many things and I would say this egg bake was a joy to make. I did prepare on Christmas Eve and made on Chrismas Day.

Made a few changes: 1/2 lb of sausage, toasted 3 pieces of bread and then chopped in cubes (left crust on), mixed with 1 1/2 C of garlic/butter crutons, added 1/4 c of yellow pepper & onion, seasoned with thyme, minced garlic in olive oil, black pepper to taste and mexican cheese.

I prepared in a 8X8 foil pan. (Sprayed with non stick spray) layered bottome of pan with break & crutons. Second layer was seasoned meat and veggie mixture. Third layer was 1 1/2 C of Mexican Cheese.  Fourth and final layer was egg mixture seasoned with salt and pepper.

Cooked uncovered for 55 minutes at 350 degrees.

My husband thought it was very good and I would make again and not just for Christmas!! Enjoy and have fun making.

Oh, this was so good! Easy prep, ingredients on hand, and such a special treat for Christmas morning.  I had some fresh sliced mushrooms to use up that I cooked with onion and sausage. Along with some Arnold Sandwich Thins on hand for the bread. It all worked for me. Glad to have found this recipe - It's a keeper!

I have made this for our Christmas breakfast for years.  Our children are grown, but would be very disappointed if this wasn't served on Christmas morning. It is good and very, very easy to make the night before and pop in the oven on Christmas morning.

My family makes something similar.
Tip: Use Jimmy Dean SPICY Sausage!!!! It really isnt spicy, but it adds A LOT of flavor! Even my picky sister loves it and she doesnt like spicy things.

My other recipe that I use I've always thought was too runny.  This one was perfect.  However, I really like sausage and others don't.  Don't be fooled, it is the main focus of the recipe.  But, if you love sausage, this one will be great for you!

Good recipe, but you should make sure that you use some type of flavored sausage instead of just ground pork since it lacks a little bit of flavor. Liked the mixure, use a little less milk than required. Added green and red onions. Would make it again - but with some sage flavored sausage.

It was okay. We made it as the recipe stated and it left a little something to be desired. It was easy to throw together and we did make it on xmas eve for xmas but will probably try a different recipe next time. The kids were not in to it at all. Just not for us I guess.

This was sadly such a disappointment on Christmas morning. I stayed up late the night before to prepare it so it would be ready to bake, but my family didn't like it. I used whole wheat bread and that might have been the problem. The bread overtook the whole dish. I think I might try the hashbrown version next time and skip the bread altogether. Oh well, it was a learning experience.

My husband wanted me to make a breakfast casserole for his family on Christmas morning, so I gave him the job to look for one.  He came across this one and it seemed pretty close to one that a guy makes at his work.  We gave it a shot and it was wonderful.  It was so easy, I love it that you make it up the night before and then only have to pop it in the oven in the morning.  It was quickly added to the make again and again list!

This was very good.  My only change was to use 6 eggs instead of 4.  I wanted it eggier.  My whole family loved it and it was super easy for me to make Sunday morning breakfast, since I only needed to pop it in the oven in the morning.

I doubled the recipe and cooked it in a 9 x 13 which made it about four inches thick. It was delicious and easy to make. I plan on cooking it a lot more.

Excellent recipe-revised recipe slightly to include maple sausage, turkey bacon, mushrooms, green onions, and 1/2 c milk +1/2 c half & half. Used 1 tbl spoon Dijon mustard instead of mustard powder and sharp cheddar chz. Cut recipe to four servings.  So delicious!!!

We followed some reviewers suggestions and cut the milk by a half cup and added 7 eggs altogether. We, however, did not use regular white bread. We had some leftover garlic bread so we used that and did not toast it. We also used regular sausage. We are so used to "light" sausage, however that the taste of the regular was too strong as well as the combination of the garlic bread. It came out very rich. Next time I think I will use regular bread and add garlic and possibly 'light' sausage. The amount of eggs and milk was great. The texture was perfect. I may make this again but I don't think it will be for Christmas. I'll reserve our Christmas breakfast for a much more delicious and decadent dish.

Very good. Added another teaspoon of mustard powder and a dash of chilli powder for more kick. Also sauteed the holy trinity of onion, celery and carrot with the sausage for a nice contrast. Definitely a keeper.

Modified the recipe slightly.  Used mild Italian sausage and chopped fresh mushrooms, fresh parsley and minced onions for added flavor.  Also, I added 3 more beaten eggs with about 1/2 cup more milk.  Came out fluffy like a souffle and everyone raved about it.  There were no left overs.

I almost didn't try this recipe because it didn't have very many ingredients and I thought it wouldn't be very tasty. But I am SO glad I took a chance! I made it exactly as written and it was VERY good and VERY easy! I will be making this for Christmas brunch every year.

This is an awesome and simple recipe!  I like it as-written and I also like it with ham instead of sausage.  Substituting ham (leftovers from Christmas Eve, even) makes it even easier because there's no need to precook the meat.  I have also made this with a variety of different cheeses including sharp cheddar, huntsman, and most recently a mixture of gouda and asiago.

Should've made note of other reviews about putting casserole in 8x8 pan instead of 9x13. 9x13 makes the casserole too thin. I tried croutons and didn't care for it. Will make this dish again without croutons in a 8x8 pan. Otherwise - hubby and I thought it was very tasty

This was really good. I used 2 lbs of sausage. 1 sage, 1 regular. I used 7 egs, and 8 slices of bread. I also added a can of green chiles. I think next time i am going to add 1 cup of salsa, and another can of green chilies, because it needed a litttle something more. Great recipes to start out with!

My new favorite casserole!  I added diced green pepper, onion and leftover potatoes from last night's dinner.  I used 6 eggs and 1 1/2cups skim milk and topped it all with chopped fresh parsley.  I baked this immediately after preparing and it's perfect!

Very good and easy recipe.  I used some of the advice from other reviews and used cheese and garlic crutons instead of bread and maple breakfast sausage.  The whole thing turned out great.  I did not need to cook it for as long as suggested, so keep an eye on yours while it is cooking to make sure you don't overcook it.

Recipe was definitely a good start, and then I followed other suggestions to finish it up.  I used croutons instead of bread, and used half regular sausage and half spicy sausage.  Now this is a family favorite!

OK, so I'm not a big egg casserole fan...but this was really really good! It was so easy, the only change I made was to use 6 eggs and did not add the dry mustard. Assembled in the night before and just popped it in the oven that morning. Looking forward to making again. GREAT RECIPE!

This is a great base recipe that can be changed for personal taste.  I added onions and bacon with a crusty vienna bread instead of the toasted white bread.  I used this for catering a small breakfast of 25 and received great praise.

Excellent and I packaged the rest for breakfast for the rest of the week. I am going to try skim milk and add spinach today in an effort to lighten the recipe. Thanks for the recipe!

This was good but I'm not a big fan of sausage casserole. Maybe with veggies in it I would like it more? Onions, bell peppers, spinach???

Really awesome recipe.  The only thing I did different was to add onions and red or green bell peppers.  It really enhanced the flavor.  Made this for my sunday school class and the loved it.

This is a delicious, no-fuss breakfast dish that incorporates all fo the flavors of a chessy egg and sausage sandwich. Croissants and brioche are wonderfully sinful substitutes for the bread and add buttery goodness! Just throw together the night before, refrigerate and throw in the oven in the a.m. for a piping hot hearty brekfast without the mess and effort. Great ANY day of the year for all occasions but really does help make Christmas morning a breeze!

I've made this a few times and have come to the realization that you really can't screw it up! I've made it slightly different every time, and prefer to use a hot sausage and an extra egg or two. The hot sausage gives it that extra flavor that everyone seems to love - even people who don't like spicy!

This was a great recipe! I followed some of the suggestions from other people to modify the original recipe a bit. I also added some red and green pepper, onion and mushrooms to get my daily vegetable intake up there. The consistency is great and I loved it!

This receipe was good.  I can't blame the receipe as I cut the fluids down a bit to much and it was a little dry.  Was very tasty.  Will try with Bacon next time as my family is more of a bacon eater than sausage.

I made this Christmas Eve to have on Christmas morning. After reading other reviews I decided to use the garlic and cheese croutons instead of the bread crumbs, I added about 1/4 tsp. nature’s seasonings, used 1/2 c. less milk and about 3 more eggs than the recipe called for. My kids were not too crazy about the garlic taste, but the adults loved the recipe.

I made this as a special breakfast for my fiance and I, so I halved the recipe. It was even better second day and on the third day my honey has requested that I make the other half of the left over ingredients! I love this savory "bread pudding" and will definitely keep it in my own recipe box for every Christmas!

I followed the recipe, and it came out as expected. However, it wasnt such a big hit with my husband (who eats anything) or me. Not sure why, I will try with some of the recommendations next time.

I made this recipe for Christmas breakfast. I assembled it the day before and popped it in the oven Christmas morning. I substituted Texas Toast for the white toast. I baked it according to the box directions first. I also doubled the eggs and used turkey sausage patties, chopped. It was a big hit, and very easy to make!

The base recipe is a good one.  I wanted to make a casserole but didn't have any meat on hand, so I made it without and it was still delicious.  I can only imagine how tasty it is with the sausage or other meat!

This was great for the busy Christmas morning!  I modified it by using vegetarian sausage, adding a few splashes of egg nog, and some leftover challah bread along with white bread.  I didn't measure the milk and just eyed it for texture as well as adding 2 more eggs.  This recipe was a great idea and the whole family loved it!

Delicious!  Even my kids love it!  I forgot this was supposed to refrigerate overnight but decided to try it anyway.  After reading numerous reviews, I used 6 eggs.  I did not have mustard powder so used 2 tsp of yellow mustard.  I put the browned sausage in the dish first, then the toasted white bread (torn, crusts left on), then poured the egg/cheese mixture over the top.  I baked it covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for 15 min. and it came out perfectly!  I used a 13X9 Pyrex dish, which I forgot to grease, and there was only minimal sticking.  I will be making this again!

We LOVE this recipe and have been using it faithfully every Christmas morning for the last 4 or 5 years. It's part of our traditions now!

To make this our own, we use Challah bread and play around with different sausage flavors. This year, we are using butter croisants for the bread.

I used wheat bread, because that is all I had- I wouldn't do that again :o) Other than that, the taste is great!
I used maple sausage, doubled the eggs, and skipped the mustard because I didn't have any on hand.

Be sure to toast the bread. I didn't and it was a little mushy but the taste was still there. I love the flavor onion gives so I added about a 1/4 cup, chopped. This was a yummy casserole!

This recipe is really good. I make it every year for Christmas. I make it the night before, pop it in the oven and cook while the kids open their presents. Take it out and then it sets right up while the kids go through there toys they got. Works perfect.

I hope this saves well. I really want to give this 4 stars, but my daughter says I'm pushing it. Maybe if I would have made it with bacon? Very easy and is really good if you love breakfast. We aren't BIG breakfast eaters. I am going to re rate this only because if it saves well I will change my rating to 4 stars. No one was here to eat it this morning. 
:( ***Update it is just as good if not better warmed up. I froze some that were left over and those are good as well. My daughter even told me to re rate it.***

I have made this for my family for several years since I first found it on Allrecipies.com.  It was the very first recipie I ever found on this website.  It is absolutely the best and EVERYONE always asks me for it.  So easy and so good! I wouldn't change a thing.

The taste was okay...a little too dry for my preference. My mom's recipe calls for 12 eggs and more milk...I'll do that one next time.

This was very good. I used whole wheat bread and it didn't dry it out at all. We ate this will syrup on top. Next time I will either make with maple syrup or use maple sausage as suggested. I used lean italian turkey sausage to cut the fat.

We all love this.  I use flavored croutons and extra cheese.  I like to make this when we have company or for Christmas morning.  I put it together the night before, refrigerate overnight, and put it in the oven the next morning as soon as I get up because it cooks a long time.  I made this one Christmas and just put it in the oven when I got up, and by the time we were finished opening presents, it was done and I didn't miss anything that was going on. With company I get up early, put it in the oven, get ready while it's cooking and still have time to visit.

I got several request for this recipe when I brought it to our MOPS meeting! I used 8 eggs, and added 1/2 tsp. black pepper and chopped green pepper. Yum!  I think the toasted bread makes all the difference.  This is the only breakfast casserole I will ever make! Thanks for sharing!

We enjoy this casserole every Christmas and some special mornings throughout the year. The only change I make is to add more eggs btwn 6-8. Just remember to add the same amount of toasted bread slices and the ratio is perfect. I also used maple sausage for this past holiday and my family really loved it.

I loved how convenient this recipe was for Christmas morning! I added green onions and a dash of cayenne to the eggs, and I used 6 eggs instead of 4. It was a little drier than I had anticipated, but I think I used too big of a pan (9x13) so it was too thin. Next time I will double the recipe. I will definitely make this again, very tasty! Thanks so much!

This was so good.  I made it for Christmas morning and the whole family decided that it would be our new tradition.  I read the reviews and also added one more egg and sauteed onion and red bell pepper.  The dried thyme was also a good suggestion.  LOVED IT!

This is a nice solid recipe.  I could tell by looking at it.  So many recipes get too specific with certain ingredients.  This recipe has way more room for adaptation (as I feel most cooks on this site tend to do is adapt recipes to their own person prefrerences.) The ingredients are simple and on hand.  You can sub in any sort of cooked meat and even some chopped vegetables.  I  used smoked venison sausage my uncle gave me instead of ground pork sausage and I added chopped onions and jalepenos and used a mexican cheese blend.  I used oatnut bread because it's all I had on hand.  I added an extra egg and reduced the milk due to previous suggestions and it turned out perfect to rave reviews.  I put this one in my recipe box for future use.  Thank you.

I make this for every before school breakfast, the teachers LOVE it!  I get rave reviews!  I sometimes substitute half of the milk with creme. I also make a veggie version, with Rotel brand tomatoes and green chili's (spicy), and spinach, instead of the meat.  Great for those vegetarians out there, and it adds great flavor!

This recipe is fantastic. My mom hates eggs and egg-based dishes, and even she likes this. Instead of mustard powder, though, I use a little rubbed sage, maybe 1/8 tsp.

Really enjoyed this (and not on Christmas!).  

My changes:  layered cut up untoasted bread in bottom of 8x8 pan; topped it with equal parts pre-cooked low-fat chicken sausage and cut up vegetarian sausage patties (it's what I had on hand); toopped with 2 cups of shredded reduced fat sharp cheddar; liquid on top was a combination of southwestern style egg-beaters, skim milk, flavored with the dry mustard and some cajun seasoning.  Put it all together and refrigerated overnight.

This gets a 5-star because it's such a great basic recipe -- easy to modify and change to taste.

My guests were honest in telling me that this casserole was o.k. but that they preferred the last one I made better (which is also found on this site, Ultimate Breakfast Casserole.)  I didn't add the additional eggs that others suggested and now agree that it does need a few extra.  Think next time I would do a mix of croutons and hashbrowns.

I made this for company and it was a HUGE hit! I decreased the milk slightly and added one more egg - it was perfect! It was very simple to make - no fuss, and wonderful not to have to cook in the morning. This is going to be a regular for company and holidays!

This has been a special occasion breakfast dish for years in my family.  The only thing done differently is we use link sausage instead of the ground.  An awesome recipe that can be adapted for many different tastes.

This was very flavorful.  I used the spicy sausage and instead of mustard powder I used yellow mustard.  It was easy to halve the recipe for my husband and I.  This has become a breakfast favorite.

Have been making this for years and yes we always have it on Christmas morning!!  It is simple and our favorite breakfast meal.  It is always great when you have guests, just throw it together the night before and throw it in the oven the next morning.  I have yet to have anyone that has not loved it1

The entire family loved this breakfast casserole.  I have made it several times already.  I made it exactly as directed except for one big mistake the first time I made it. I forgot to grease the pan.  What a mess.  My husband soaked and scrubbed that pan for hours.  (I personally would have just thrown the thing away it was that bad.) Thanks for the great recipe.

Does not necessarily need to be made a day ahead, but great to have the option.  A real man-pleasing breakfast with the sausage. I have made it 3 times already, and any leftovers are also good the next day.

I have not made this casserole before but I make a breakfast casserole for Christmas.  I use 2 boxes of croutons in place of the bread.  They soak up the egg mixture overnight and have alot more flavor than plain bread.  Just a bit of a time saver too.

Over the past few years, I have been trying different breakfast casseroles for Christmas morning.  After last years' attempt failed, I was very scared to try anymore (especially since my whole family who comes for brunch requested NO casserole).  But I decided to try one more different recipe, hoping to find a good one.  Well, this year's recipe was a winner!  My family not only raved about it but said they are coming back next year just for this casserole.  I didn't make any changes, but I did use Jimmy Dean Sage Pork Sausage.  It was the first thing that disappeared from the buffet table.

I’m giving this 5 stars, because the entire family just loved it, despite the fact that following the cooking instructions in the recipe made for an extremely burnt bottom to the casserole.  Good thing we’d made extra!  We just ate the top and middle.  We doubled the recipe, and used half hot sausage and half regular, used half an half rather than the milk as others suggested, and Texas toast.  I think this is going to become a tradition, it was so nice to have breakfast ready when we were all hungry, without any fuss!

Good but not great.  Kids loved it but I thought it could use some extra spice.  I followed the recipe except I used maple sausage.

I made this dish for a Boss's Day brunch.  Unfortunately, once it was in the fridge chilling, I became ill.  I didn't make it to the brunch, but I had my husband carry the dish in to work for me.  
Upon my return to work, all my coworkers told me how my casserole was delicious and a lot of them wanted my recipe.  Allrecipes.com had been one of the very best sites for cooking ever, and I've never been disappointed with any of the recipes I've tried from this site.

This is my go-to brunch recipe.  I mkae it for my family on holidays, and I make it anytime I am having company over for brunch.  It's always a big hit.  For some reason I always use at least one more egg and 4 slices of bread as opposed to 6.  I can't remember why I started doing that, but I like it that way.  I've also made a vegetarian version.  Instead of sausage I use sauteed peppers & onions.  Awesome!

Apart from the fact that this was a bit too salty, this was very tasty.  Next time I'll leave out the 1/2 teaspoon of salt -- the sausage is salty enough.

This is a family favorite. Easy to fix. Great with cubed ham (sugar cured ham not salt cured) instead of sausage too. I've tried bacon, but we just didn't care for it that way. I do use a little more cheese and 1 more egg. This is good for pot luck brunches too. Travels well, reheats well.

First off let me state that it is great to have allrecipes around, and second if I have to fine tune a recipe for my family's taste thats ok to since I wouldn't be looking for a recipe if I could make them up myself.  I really have to dislike a recipe to give it lower than four stars even after modifying it.  This was great, we use it every Sunday and have always had high reviews.  I do change somethings to our preference.  I use mild Italian Sausage, add some green pepper and onion.  Thank you for a great post.

I made this for a playoff morning game. I got a compliment about the dish I made from just about everyone! 
I double the recipe to feed more, and tripled the eggs, because I love eggs and this worked out in the recipe just fine! For the 2 lbs. of sausage (2 because I doubled the recipe) I actually used maple AND sage sausage. One pound of each. The maple definitley overpowered the sage, but It was sooo delicious. Next time I will make this with maple sausage only. Definitley a keeper!

This is sooooo good. I realy dissliked the putting and out and in the oven bit, but it is worth the effort. I love making this for potluck's and lazy sundays. I emailed this to my relitives in Spain and they were happily surprised too. I do add a little garlic powder and use the sage sausage. NOW THATS BRUNCH :)

Excellent and easy. I halved the recipe (using 3 eggs instead of 2, only 3/4 cup milk, and sharp instead of mild cheddar), made it in a pie plate and cut into wedges like quiche. It only took 45 mins to bake (30 covered; 15 uncovered). I just warmed some leftovers up in the microwave and they were great too, so if you don't want to take the time to bake in the morning, I think it would be okay to bake the night before. Also, I used maple flavored sausage. While it was good, next time I'll use regular.

I made this recipe for Christmas brunch this morning and it was delicious!  Although it overcooked at the bottom a bit (due to fact that I had to cook it along with a ham at the same time on the bottom shelf) everone loved it.  I used 6 eggs instead of 4, and a bit more sausage.  I will make again when this recipe can be center stage in the center of my electric oven!

I tried this recipe for a work brunch,and it was almost all gone before I got to sample a small piece. I cut up the sausages into small bits, and dotted them on top before baking. You can add bacon, broccoli florets, etc to make it interesting. Will make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

This was good, but not great.  It's probaby a matter of personal preference.  I did use cubes of italian bread instead of regular white bread, but I believe that helped the recipe rather than hinder it.  I'm not big on soggy bread, and italian has a denser texture than white, so I'm glad I did that.  It was better heated up the second morning.  It was good, but I'll probably stick to the "Sausage Casserole, Submitted by: Bill Rossbach" from this site.

This was really good & SUPER EASY. I didn't make it ahead and it cooked in about 50 mins-think I would definitely add another egg or two & half the salt next time. The cheese & sausage (for me) gave it plenty of saltiness. It browns up so nicely & looks great when done. Thanks! i will definitely make this again!

A Christmas morning hit - made a few changes based on other reviews.  I doubled the recipe but tripled the eggs (I used a dozen), then I divided into an 8x8 and a 9x13 - turned out great

This was awesome!! I should have doubled it because everyone was eating this rather than everything else that I made! I followed the directions except I only kept in in the second time at 375 for only 15 minutes! AWESOME!!! A must have for any occasion!

I've made this recipe every Christmas morning for about 10 years and its not only convenient - its a smashing hit with everyone! I do use a sharp cheddar instead of mild and I will be taking the tip of hash browns over top! Could it be possible to improve on perfection? I think it might! Thanks for the tip!

Wow! What a contrast to the bland, greasy breakfast casseroles I've been used to! As others before me have said, the dry mustard is what really makes this recipe shine! Since you prepare it the night before, it's perfect for Thanksgiving or Christmas morning when Mom's in the kitchen and doesn't want to  do anything with breakfast except throw it in the oven!

I used rye bread and a small jar of mushrooms. It was great.
I also prepare the day before and just pop it in the oven when I first get up.

I tried this for Easter brunch, and my husband requested it again... a big hit! I used spicy sausage, 3 cups cheese, 8 eggs, a good Tablespoon of Worc. sauce (1/4 t is hardly worth mentioning as an ingredient if you ask me), a dash of green tobasco sauce... and topped it off w/ a pound of bacon. Delicious!! Dab the extra oil off the top and it's PERFECT! I used Kings Hawaiian Bread Rolls because I ran out of the french bread... and it was delectable.

This is the best!! Everyone loved it at work. Even made one replacing the sausage with potatoes to accommodate non-meat eaters. Browned diced potatoes with salt and pepper until done. Thought it would be bland--but it wasn't!

This was ok.  Good flavor, but mine was really thin, maybe my pan was bigger than 9x13.  I added onion, as suggested by others and regular yellow mustard, since I didn't have any ground mustard.  I might make it again, but not too often, it wasn't as big of a hit as I expected. I would also try bread stuffing or something as suggested for more flavor.

This went over VERY well for Christmas brunch. I will admit it looked really weird going into the fridge the night before - looked too bread cubey and I had big doubts about the dish.  But I cooked it anyway the next morning and VOILA! Everyone loved it!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used spiced sausage and bought croutons for the bread. YUM

This was very tasty!  The mustard gives it a pleasant zip. My whole family enjoyed this - went for seconds and thirds!  I will experiment next time by subbing bacon for the suasage and adding onion and mushrooms.

This was the perfect Christmas morning breakfast!  So easy and absolutely yummy!  I added two eggs and used only four slices of bread, but otherwise kept everything the same.  It was great to have it all fixed the night before, and the next-day leftovers were super!  Definitely a keeper and not just for Christmas.

What a great recipe.  I worried that 6 slices of bread would fill a 9 x 13" pan, but it baked up perfectly.  I made 2 casseroles, one using the ingredients in the recipe and the other adding green pepper, onion and mushrooms.  We also used salsa as a topping.  They were both wonderful.  I agree this recipe should not just be listed under Christmas since it's too good to be overlooked.

Excellent Recipe, I did make a couple modifications to it for use here though.
 2 lbs ground pork sausage - 1 regular, 1 sage
 2 tsp mustard powder
 1 tsp salt
 1 tsp ground black pepper
15 eggs, beaten
 4 cups milk
12 slices white bread, toasted and cut into cubes
   (6 white and 6 wheat)
 1 lb. mild Cheddar cheese, shredded
Used a commercial weight 9x15 pan and baked for 1 hr 45 min total time.

I served this dish for a PTA breakfast of 17 women at 8:30am! I loved the fact that I was able to prepare it the night before and just pop it in the oven the next morning.  I used Sage flavored sausage, as recommended by someone else.  Everyone, loved it and wanted the recipe, which I did make copies of in advance.

VERY GOOD!
I prepared it the night before, then baked it on Christmas morning while we opened presents. It was ready and hot when we were! Everyone loved it!
I loved not having to worry about "cooking" on Christmas morning!

This recipe deserves the rave reviews!  I had a few friends over recently at mid-morning and almost the entire dish was gone!  It was easy and delicious.  Thanks for posting.

Very delicious and easy to put together.  I used this receipe for Christmas Morning Breakfast 2002 and everyone enjoyed it very much.  It will become a tradition at our house.  I substituted wheat bread for the white bread.

Excellent recipe.  I used cut up precooked link sausages (that's what I had in the freezer!) and added a little scallion for kick.  Very tasty; I had someone request the recipe the very first time I made it.

I made this for an office breakfast, and it was gone in a flash! I added green onions for color, but in retrospect, I would have added them after cooking it or just left them out. This is easy and delicious!

This recipe is pretty good.  My family like it OK.  I thought it was a bit bland, even using sage sausage.  I guess I'll make it until I find something better.

I was searching for a good breakfast casserole to serve my family.  My brother and his wife are very picky eaters and I needed something that had flavor but not onions, tomatoes or bell peppers!  This was perfect.  I used challah bread ( an egg bread) and added 6 more eggs (instead of just 4) and some black pepper.  I also used the sage sausage and it came out beautifully.  Since I was browning the sausage, I doubled the amount and froze the extra 1/2  for use in breakfast tacos and omelets. oh - my brother ate 3 helpings of this and his wife liked it too! My parents also enjoyed this - it was a hit!

This was delicious!  If you're concerned about fat and your weight this is definitely NOT for you!  But if you like a good, cheesey, meatey and scrumptious breakfast every now and again, this is it!  We made it for Christmas breakfast and there were NO leftovers - everyone had secconds and most had THIRDS!  I believe this is going to be our new traditional Christmas breakfast!

My entire family loved it!   I have other Christmas morning casseroles, but this one has become our favorite.   It was great to pop it in the oven and enjoy.  Sliced fruit rounded out our meal and everyone raved!   Thanks for the delicious casserole.

Absolutely wonderful. I made it last year in a 9X13 inch pan and it was too thin. Put it in a deep, square corningware and it was great.  Nice,thick and delicious. Can't wait for next Christmas.

I changed recipe this just a bit, from 5 slices of white bread to 8 slices of seeded rye bread (made by Wegman's in Rochester NY).  This rye is smaller than normal white bread.  It turned out great - pleasing to the eye and the palate.  I will make it again and again.  signed a quality freak

Tried this for Christmas breakfast, and it was loved by all!  I doubled the eggs and cheese for a thicker casserole, and it still came out wonderful!  Very easy to do as reduced-fat, as well.  A tasty dish that is perfect for busy mornings!

My family liked this pretty well, but it wasn't as great as I was expecting. Like everyone else mine was a little greasy, and I used a lean sausage that I drained very well. I think all the grease is from the cheese. Perhaps next time I'll try American cheese and see if that eliminates the grease.

I just made this for Christmas brunch this morning. It was a hit! I used 10 jumbo eggs to make it a little heartier. I combined this with the overnight apple cinnamon french toast. Both easy, delicous and made the night before!! Thank you!

I was disappointed in this recipe.  It sounded so good, but we found it a bit bland.  I think that I may try it again with a spicier sausage.  It was very easy and convenient to prepare the night before.

This is one of the best tasting egg casserole dishes I have had.  I liked that it didn't taste soggy, probably due to the fact that the bread is toasted before cooked.  This was a big hit at the brunch I served.  I am glad I made two pans!

My sister-in-law makes this every year for our family get together Christmas morning and it is a warm comfort food that everyone loves. We also have homemade Cinnamon rolls that I take along to finish out the perfect morning brunch.

This recipe was great when I cut it down to four adults and served it with an apple dish,juices and rolls. It was equally popular with my fifteen family members the next weekend. I did make two casserols and received raves from the food  critics for the regular and substituted  spicy sausage.

I made this with Italian saugage which gave it a lot of flavor.  Made it for Bosses Day and every one loved it.

I was  really dissapointed  after reading all the rave reviews.  Maybe I need to try a spicier sausage to add some sort of flavor.  I also don't understand why it sets for 8 hrs but I did what the recipe called for and just didn't care for it.

I have been using this base recipe for years. I use 11x13 pan, each year I do something different with one of the ingredients or I add something. My first try of the recipe as directed was pretty good but thin, so like many reviewers I added things. I always make with 8-10 eggs, as I am typically feeding 6-8 this as the main brunch food, brown and white bread toasted in oven until very dry but not dark, Cracker Barrel White Sharp Cheddar and I add a total of 1.5 cups of cheese. This year its Sharp Cheddar and Pepper Jack. This does take longer to cook so start earlier....

For those that don't eat wheat or bread like me, I make a separate one with out bread and add two to three tablespoonos of  real Maple syryp to egg mix and only add 1/2 cup of whole heavy cream instead of the milk it calls for. Cook at 350 for 30 min

This receipe is so delicious, it was worth doubling it and frying all the sausage
for it (which is the only time-consuming aspect)!  It is so thick and cheesy,
people thought it was quiche!  Excellent & delicious!

This was so easy and good! I fed 10 people who all loved it, from 18- months to 64 years old! I tore bread to cover the bottom of a greased 9x13 glass casserole dish. Put 4 pounds of cooked sausage ( half original, half sage), green onions and chopped mushrooms on top and then sprinkled about 3 cups mixed Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese on that. Beat 1 T dry mustard With a cup of milk and 18 eggs. Put in fridge overnight, followed instructions for baking and it came out perfectly. Yum!

I got this recipe in an email and had most ingredients on hand. I baked Texas toast cheesy garlic bread and let it dry out all day. I used an 11x7 pan, lined the bottom with the cheese bread, then the sausage which I added some minced, sautéed onion. Then the cheese and poured the egg mixture over all. I covered it with foil and let it sit overnight . I let it sit out for a bit before baking because I used stoneware. It was puffy and just so delicious.

I used an old hard stale baguette that I had to break up with a  kitchen mallet, and I used sage sausage. It was super easy and so delicious! The servings are generous, so you could probably get 12 moderate-sized servings if you also serve a side of fruit with it.

My family really  liked it. I had to alter the recipe because I have  two vegetarians in the family, so I used a plant-based sausage.  The other family members didn’t seem to notice and gobbled it up.

This is my go-to recipe for any overnight company. 

This recipe is great as it is.  Although i recommend not toasting the bread.  If you don't toast the bread, it soaks up the cheese and sausage flavor better, and you get a fluffier casserole. 

And for a little extra flavor......

I partially render the sausage, covered, and then add onions,  cook covered until mostly rendered.  Then uncover and finish cooking until sausage is browned.   

Unless it's a REALLY greasy sausage, I don't drain the grease.   (not the healthy choice, but, hey, it's Christmas)  The grease soaks through the bread and eggs in the overnight soak and adds significantly to flavor.  Add a tsp of herb infused olive oil and it's magnifique :)

This was super good.  I made it as written except I used maple sausage and laid down fresh pieces of sourdough instead of toasting/cubing. Sprinkle this with asiago!!!  Sooooo good that way!

Added some Trader Joe's croutons (about half a bag) and used 6 eggs, used maple sausage. It was perfect.

I could not wrap my mind around putting bread in it and since I was making this for co-workers, I played it safe. I added 1 more egg and 3 1/2 cups of hash browns. I will try it with bread/toast next time and will adjust the stars if need be.

Soooo yummy!! I read the reviews and made a lot of the changes that were recommended. I used 8 eggs, used Jimmy Dean maple sausage, and I used cheese/garlic croutons. It was so good!! We will be making this again soon!

Amazing casserole!!! I took some notes from others and put a couple of my own. My mom doesn't eat much and can be picky, and she went back for seconds. 

Use Jimmy Dean Maple sausage. That may be  the most important distinction. Use 6 eggs instead of 4. No need for salt due to the sausage and cheese. I did add about a quarter tsp more of the ground mustard. I used Nature's Own Honey Wheat bread and Sargentos Four State Cheddar. I also added garlic pepper. 

Hands down the best breakfast casserole I've ever had.

These little morsels are the bomb! Fat bomb! I too tweaked the recipe a little. I did 1/2 cup of grass fed butter and 1/2 cup of Coconut Oil. And I used 1/3 cup of Swerve (Erythritol). So smooth and creamy! Instead of placing them in muffin tray I used a small casserole dish, froze it and then cracked pieces apart. Amazing.

I make a version of this using hot  (spicy) sausage, a layer of hash browns (instead of bread cubes), and sharp cheddar.   Instead of Christmas, we invite everyone over for New Year's day brunch, followed by a day of Bowl games.   This is a hardy meal for those who may have overindulged the night before, and is a good start to a day inside.

I added a little milk to a cream of something (chicken, celery, mushroom) soup and poured over the top of casserole before baking.
I've also used bacon or ham instead of sausage for a change up.

I made a couple changes. First  I used left over biscuits instead of bread. Second I fried up a few slices of bacon and added it with the sausage. My family LOVED IT!
I will certainly be making this again

Wonderful recipe. I made this this morning for the early football game. Switched out the bread with hash browns. And broiled at the end to get a crispy top.  Next time I will add some onions, green peppers, and sprinkle some paprika on the top.

I used 6 eggs, 1/2 C milk and sprinkled the cheese on top.  Also added black pepper to my taste. I baked in an 8x8 glass pan covered with tin foil for an hour.  Turned the oven off and uncovered the pan and left in the oven until everyone was ready to eat.  It was perfect and very filling!

This recipe as it is, is wonderful! I baked mine right after making it because I didnt realize you are supposed to refrigerate it for at least 8 hours until it was too late. It turned out yummy! So, if you're like me and just follow the recipe minus the refrigeration by accident dont worry!! It is still delicious!  I stuck it in oven and THEN started reading reviews. That was enough to make me believe there was no hope. Well, there is! Idk what other ppl were talking about soggy, needing extra eggs, using cream or half and half. Mine was not soggy at all. Maybe ppl didnt use enough bread? Maybe they were using regular sandwhich bread? Or maybe letting it sit makes it soggy? I sliced and toasted 2 deli hoagie rolls in oven @ 350 until hardened. It was enough bread to soak up most of the egg mixture before pouring it in the baking dish. I made mine for 3 teenagers and the whole dish was gone in 2 1/2 hrs! They just kept coming back for more. Thank you for the recipe. Will make again after soaking and try to leave another review.

Don't bake it quite as long as it says.  The taste is great, the texture is smooth, all who eat it have been complimentary. Easy to make ahead as well.

We have been making this for over a decade now. My sons never leave any leftovers. I use sage flavored sausage and extra sharp cheddar. Make sure that you prep it the night before you plan to bake.

Some of the tweaks people recommend do not sound appetizing at all. This is my husband’s favorite breakfast casserole. He will even prep it himself sometimes when he wants it. The recipe is excellent as written. You can add stuff if you want to. I make this many times a year. It is great for us to prep and then enjoy weekend mornings together. Some additions we have tried are green chilies, spinach, mushrooms, green pepper, onions, jalapeño, different cheeses, different breads. Veggies are sautéed first. We mainly make it just as written. Don’t down vote a recipe just because you assemble it different or substitute an ingredient. 
I love this recipe and my husband does too!

I added rotel and chopped broccoli and bumped the amount of eggs to 6.  It was delicious.  The kids didn't even know I added the veggies, so it was a win for me.

We love this dish!!  We make it with turkey sausage crumbles and add garlic powder , dash of sage, and onion powder.  Because  it is baked for 45 minutes at a higher temperature, then additionally at lower temperature, the texture turns out perfectly and it is mouthwateringly dellicious.

No changes this time, but it was very salty. Next time I won't add salt, relying on the cheese and the sausage for that. Also next time I'll use sweet Italian sausage in the recipe.

This is a great recipe.  I use day old baguettes and use at least 6 eggs.  The crusty baguettes need time to soak up the egg and milk mixture.   It is important to refrigerate for at least 8 hours.  When using the crusty bread I leave it quite large.  It adds a wonderful crunch to the casserole.

This is delicious! Always turns out great. I’ve made it night before and refrigerated, and in the morning and both come out yummy. I also add a little parsley, but other than that, it’s great as is.

I used 8 eggs and 8 pieces of untoasted bread.  Followed the other instructions. Added frozen sliced mushrooms and broccoli instead of sausage.

This is my go to breakfast casserole recipe!  It's so easy and making it the night before makes it that much easier.   It's great for holiday brunches because you can make it ahead of time.

I received a lot of compliments on this recipe! I used 8 eggs and 1 3/4 cups of milk. I added chopped green onion. I also used toasted Texas toast like other reviews recommended. I did bake it for the recommended time (1 hour w/foil over top, 30 min uncovered), and it was great, but a bit overly browned around the edges. I might try for less baking time next time. It's SO delicious and I plan on making it again soon!

Easy to make ahead and it was gobbled up! Followed other suggestions and used 1 lb maple sausage and 1 lb regular.  Used 8 eggs, 1 1/2 cup milk and 2 tsp of dry mustard.  I also cut the crust off regular white bread slices and layered the bottom of the dish with bread.  I think I'll add bacon bits to the egg mixture next time to kick up the flavor a bit.

I Used flat tator tot rounds from Kroger instead of bread, extra meat, cheese and more eggs. I mixed all ingredients in a bowl then poured into my Pyrex casserole container cover with foil and let it sit over night in the fridge.  Next morning let it sit out about 30 mins before popping in the oven, cooked an extra 25 mins at recommended temp.  Ever since I found this receipe I fix it every year for the holidays and the family really enjoys it and looks forward to this holiday treat . Thanks for sharing your receipe.

We had this for Christmas morning and my family flipped for it.  Wanting to steer them away from traditional sweet rolls, I took a risk.  Since then, we've had it a few more times.  I went the hash brown route.  Used one 20 oz package of hash browns and it worked perfectly.  The kids wanted more sausage so I used a pound and a half.

Loved loved loved this soup. Made it pretty much as written, with the exception of just sautéing the veggies and chicken first and then boiling the chicken in the broth. Used frozen egg noodles. Fall off the bone chicken, lovely and flavorful! Will be making often.

I added a diced onion, some sliced mushrooms, & a few dashes of garlic powder. Some chopped fresh basil & some fetta cheese. Also replaced the bread with hash brown potatoes. Oh  & some broccoli spears.(alt. could be spinach)
Turned out good, but I won't include the basil or the fetta cheese next time, as I couldn't even taste it after it cooked. I also used mixed white/orange cheddar cheese & topped with slices of tomato.

I made this with chicken sausage and gluten free Chalah bread.  OMG, it was fantastic!  I will make it again and use the same bread!  The bread has a different flavor than plain bread and that's what made it so good.

I made this casserole for Christmas brunch and everyone loved it - it's going to be my go to for brunch! I did make a couple changes. I did not use smoked sausage and instead used Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage (In the roll, which  is not really very hot)  and did not brown it much; only enough to separate it and get it into small pieces.  I did use bread but used un-toasted potato bread and only three slices. I used a bit more cheese as well and added diced scallions to the mix. It was delicious and there was nothing left in no time! Awesome and easy recipe!

I made this twice - one for our Christmas brunch, except instead of mustard powder I used actual Dijon mustard, and it turned out very well.

The second time I made it I used Dijon mustard as well, but added sautéed mushrooms and onions into the mixture and WOW!!!

So I made this recipe exactly as stated.  It tasted like egg bread.  It lacked flavor and texture.  I decided to remake it with the suggestions of maple sausage and croutons.  It was more flavorful, but still the texture was not great.  I will next time go back to my reliable hashbrown, cheese and ham casserole.

I've been looking for a missing crouton-based breakfast recipe and decided to give this a try. I don't typically rate recipes I change as I don't think it is fair to the submitter and irritates me, yet I'm trying to figure out the other one. Yes, how do you know how many stars to give if you don't follow the recipe as written... but expect it is great as written due to similarities of the two!  I covered the bottom of a 9x13 pan with a single layer of cheese-flavored croutons , about 7 oz or one and a half  5-oz packages. The next morning, it looked like it needed more moisture so I added 2 more eggs and 1 cup milk, and it turned out great.  I did add about 1 Tbsp onion to the cooking sausage (missing recipe) and used Swiss (based on company preference). Everyone really enjoyed it. I think if I only used a 5 oz package of croutons, it probably would have been fine with the eggs and milk as written. I will omit or reduce the salt next time because of the salt in the croutons. I also would not reduce the milk especially if using croutons. Just cook until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean! I like to add the egg mixture over the croutons, meat and cheese. Thank you, MKM!

It’s a little bit bland and I feel the ratio of egg to milk is too soupy.  I find the best ratio is 2 eggs to 1/2c liquid so we normally end up with 6 eggs & 1 1/2 c milk/cream.  We really like the left overs so going extra with the eggs  works for us.

Easy to make and tastes pretty darn good. The only change I made was to double the sausage. It was nice not having a ton of dishes after Christmas breakfast. I'll surely make it again when I need to free up some cleanup time in the morning.

So, I'm famous for not reading a recipe thoroughly before I start to make something.  I was making this on Christmas morning, and then I read the part where you should chill it for 8 hours.  Well, I was in too deep, so I made it anyway, without chilling it, and baked it for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  It was great.  I'll be making this again, and I won't bother chilling overnight because my family liked it that way too.  I did layer the ingredients in my pan as follows:  Bread-sausage-egg mixture-cheese.

This recipe was very good just like it was. You can always add stuff such as onions and change a little here and there.  It was not dry.  Just perfect.

Turned out delicious !! A few minor changes made...I used fresh garlic bread from the bakery and maple sausage. It was the perfect balance of sweet and savory that way. On my permanent breakfast menu!

This is a great simple recipe. I followed it exactly. Everyone liked it a lot except several people said it was a little too much cheese. Next time I will half the cheese and maybe add a little bacon and potatoes =)

Wonderful Christmas breakfast!  I used just 1lb of regular sausage so it was a little spicy, but that is how I like it.  I may try the sage sausage next time just to compare.

I made it with the ingredient quantities specified, but I added a conservative sprinkle of garlic powder, pepper and some powdered sage to it.  I thought it was good, and my family liked it.  It's very similar to the sausage and tater tot recipe from a couple of weeks ago, except this one has twice the eggs.  We didn't like the earlier one as well.  Next time, I'll follow Leah Joy's advice and add some green onion and use less milk.

Awesome breakfast casserole.  I took the suggestions of others and used Cheese and Garlic flavored croutons, 6 eggs and 1 1/2 cup of milk.  Next time I plan to use 8 eggs or less croutons.  I also baked it in a 9x9 dish.  Everyone went for 2nds.

Excellent breakfasts item.  We made it for Christmas Morning.  I don't know if my bread was bigger than those used in the recipe but it seemed a bit dry.  So I added 2 extra eggs with a cup of milk.  Turned out perfect.

Wonderful. A hit every year for my meat eaters. 6 eggs. And I used brioshe hamburger rolls that I cut into cubes. I also did not prep the night before. I just soaked it for 15 min before baking as I cooked the sausage. It came out perfect and even a little more moist than when I soaked it overnight.

I made this for just the two of us so I used half the quantities listed, although I added a 3rd egg. Baked it in the Pampered Chef stone casserole baker that holds a half of a 9x13. Perfection. Keeping the leftovers out of the fridge because we might need to nibble on it

This recipe has become a Christmas morning tradition.  I've never had one person not eat it, usually there are a couple folks fighting over the last piece! Filling, with a perfect blend of familiar  breakfast flavors.

I have been baking this breakfast casserole on Christmas morning for at least the past ten years.  It has been perfect every year!  It's so easy, delicious, and allows me to enjoy opening presents with the family while this is cooking in the oven.  I highly recommend this recipe!!

Love this recipe.  To add a little different texture and some extra crunch, I bake 8 hash browns to crispy and layer the bottom with them.  You may or may not want to cut back on toast with doing this,  Delicious!

I loved, followed someone’s else about putting hash browns instead of bread, was amazing. I’ve nade it twice. But the sides and bottoms seem to burn on me. Maybe it’s cause of what I used on the pan. What does anyone else use?

I used 1 1/2 cups of milk and a 1/2 cup of half & half.
Next time I will try 3/4 tsp of salt, instead of 1/2 tsp. Thought it needed a touch more.
Everyone loved it and wanted the recipe.

I've made this repeatedly over the years not just for Christmas! A +++ this is . I  occasionally use different meats bacon ham etc. Cheap bread makes it best and a pinch of cayenne if you like a little heat.  You can get away with little soak time 30 minutes at room temp works.

I've made this dozens of times. It's SO good! I never let it sit overnight and always use 8 or more eggs. I always use prepared mustard and regular bread torn up in small pieces. I mix it all up and bake it in a 13x9 for 45 min on 350° covered. Then I uncover it and bake for 20 min on 325°. Even my 2 year old said it's delicious!

I make breakfast casseroles all the time and this is my favorite so far. I do use a french bread, to get some texture and add mushrooms and green/red peppers. Great upon reheating too.

My recipe ended up great, but only because I tweaked it quite a bit based on user reviews. I wanted a more eggy casserole so added about 12 eggs, reduced the milk to about 1 cup, added green onions, and used turkey sausage to reduce the fat. I left out my bread instead of toasting it. My casserole was a hit at the teacher appreciation breakfast so I would make it again.

Followed the recipe using half a day old baguette as my bread and it was WAY TOO SALTY! Next time I will not add any salt. Even though I baked it at 375° F, it took way longer than stated in the recipe. One hour covered and another 40 minutes uncovered seemed to do the trick.

I preheated oven for 20 minutes at 350 & did not fix the night before. Browned 1 3/4  lbs. of Jimmy Dean regular pork sausage & drained all grease out. Mixed  8 eggs, 6 cups of french bread, not toasted.  I used pizza cutter to cut 3/4 inch cubes of french bread.  1 3/4 cup of whole milk, 1 tsp. of mustard powder, 1/4  tsp. of pepper, 1 1/2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. No salt was added. Mixed all ingredients & placed in a 9x13 glass pan. Heated it for 45 minutes, then added 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar cheese on top for 5 more minutes.

I followed the recipe the first time, it took an additional 45 to get it to be not soggy. I took advise from reviews and I made it with 1 cup of half and half instead of the 2 cups of milk, and 6 eggs. Turned out perfect, my family loves it!

I had about 4 or 5 breakfast casseroles in my favorites, and needed to make something for a breakfast pitch in at my office.
I chose this dish because of the high rating and my love for sausage.
It did not disapoint...there were three casseroles all side by side, and this one was the fan favorite!!
I will definately make this for my family in the future...and more than once a year ;)

I personally add in peppers, onions, etc otherwise the recipe is too bland... The recipe itself is a good start, but feel free to add in what you like because it won't hurt the overall outcome :)

Turned out so good! I'm not a big fan of sausage, but really liked this casserole. Thought it would be similar to a quiche, but turned out very different, more like breakfast sandwich mixed together. The cubed bread soaked up most the liquid. I used day old french bread (about 2/3 the loaf), toasting dried it out more.

Tried this for New Years day.  It was good, but not awesome.  Both kids liked it.  Left overs reheated well.  I used half/half instead of milk.  I also added in green pepper and onion.

I made this last Christmas for our family brunch and everyone liked it, but it didn't quite satisfy our spicy southwest palates. So I read some of the changes others made and altered the basic recipe to give it some zing:  First, I scrapped the bread and lightly seared a 20 ounce package of Simply Potatoes Southwest Style hash browns and spread then into the bottom of the casserole dish. I used 5 eggs and half a pint of egg whites to give it more volume. I used 1-cup of half & half instead of 2-cups of milk. While browning the sausage I also added  fresh Pico de Gallo (Safeway produce department) and some diced white onion. Finally I added a tiny can of diced Ortega chilies and a dash of Tabasco sauce. I poured the mixture over the hash browns, covered it with aluminum foil and refrigerated overnight. What a 5-star hit it was this year!

Awesome! I always read the comments for variations before making recipes. I tweaked this one a little by adding 2 more eggs & lining the bottom of the casserole dish with toast before adding the sausage/egg mixture. It was delicious!! My kids and fiancé LOVED it! I brought the leftovers to my moms house for Christmas breakfast too. I don't like sausage so I didn't have high hopes for myself, but I even liked it!! Will be making again!!

Followed everything per the recipe except for adding the mustard (husband hates it), only did 1 & 1/4 cup milk and just threw it in the oven right away at 350 for 45 minutes without letting it sit in the fridge at all.  Came out great! Will be making it again.

This dish was a phenomenal success. I followed this recipe exactly: made the day before, baked for an hour at 350, baked for half an hour at 325....then it "sat" covered for a little bit while I made a couple of other things. It wasn't soggy or anything in the slightest. The only difference was that I accidentally used five eggs instead of four....(and I did used sausage with sage as well.)  Perhaps I'll do that from now on, because this casserole turned out perfectly! It was even better the next day! I'd definitely serve this to company.

My family enjoyed this casserole! I found that it was a bit on the salty side, which I think was because of the sausage as well as the garlic flavored Texas toast that I used.  The next time I make this, I’ll omit the salt.

i used Italian turkey sausage.   Seasoned it with sage, and used a 1/2 cup 2% milk and 1/4 cup heavy cream.  I also used 4 slices of bread instead of 6 slices.

Rave reviews by the family.

Very yummy. I'd cut back
 on the bread and add more sausage. Less carbs and more protein.

Fabulous!  I took the suggestion of some other viewers and doubled the recipe, using 12 eggs and 2 1/2 cups half n half.  I layered the bread cubes, sausage, and then egg mixture all in a 13 x 9 dish.  It was a perfect fit and wonderfully moist and delicious!  I used sage and regular sausage (1/2 of each), made  it the day before, set it out for 30 minutes at room temp. and baked for 70 minutes at 350.  My first time to make and it was great!

This recipe reminded me so much of what my mom used to make growing up. I didn't toast the bread and it turned out great. I used a smaller pan so it was thicker, it still cooked evenly with the recipe's temp and cook time. This is our new Christmas tradition!

I’ve made this recipe numerous times but use 8 eggs instead because otherwise it’s not enough for my liking. I’ve also switched and used bacon instead or in addition to the sausage. It’s always a huge hit & I love that it get made the night before so I don’t have to be in the kitchen when family shows up.

I think 4 eggs must be a typo. Is that accurate? If you look at comparable recipes they call for about 8 eggs. Sorry, to put this in the review. I wish there was an option for questions.

I love this recipe! I tweek it a little by adding spicy sausage and maple links (chopped up) along with a dab of syrup. You have to add about 3 more eggs but it’s amaze balls! Its like everything breakfast in one bite!

This casserole is amazing. I took it to my Bible Study where we share breakfast before starting. Everybody raved about it.  I did make some changes. I used 2 more eggs and added about 1/2 cup butter and garlic croutons. I will make this again for Christmas morning.

I followed some of the suggestions in other reviews, as 2 cups of milk to only 4 eggs seemed like it would end up a soggy mess. I used 6 eggs, just over 1 cup milk, 4 slices of bread with no crusts, and about 1/2 pound of sausage, cheese as called for, and put it in a 8x8 casserole dish.  In the morning all the liquid was soaked up, so I can't imagine using 6 slices of bread.  I ended up mixing up 2 more eggs and a 1/2 cup milk and pouring that over the top before baking.  I forgot to cover it first, so at 1 hour is was practically done, but since I had another hour before I needed to take it somewhere, I covered it with foil, turned the oven down to about 250, and left it in another 30 minutes.  It tasted great, and the pan was empty, so I didn't have to bring home or throw out leftovers!  Will definitely be making again!

This was very good.  Made for a work breakfast and would definitely make again.  Used 6 eggs as many others had stated, but went exactly by recipe for all other ingredients.

Lol my family made a group decision to switch from Christmas dinner to Christmas brunch because of this casserole! My mom made it while we were growing up and we decided we weren't giving up that tradition!  She makes it just like this, except she doesn't toast and cube the (day old) bread.

I have made this dish often but altered as well.... instead of bread I will add roasted potatoes (cut into bite size pieces), as well 6 eggs instead of 4 and only one cup of milk. It is such a great way to start the day.

Easy and tasty.  I make this almost every year.  It is so easy to make, store over night and  cook it before your company arrives.  
I’ve used it during the holidays but this time I tried it while vacationing at the beach.  It’s a hit with our family.  

The only word of advice that I would offer is to not to expect it to last more than a few days.    It has a tendency to dry out a bit.

I was looking for a breakfast dish for the holidays. Found it! very savory and the bread forms a delicious crust. Also very filling, so a little goes a long way. Thank you!

This was delicious, and a huge hit at the potluck I brought it to. Like many others, I used 6 eggs and Jimmy Dean Maple sausage. The bread I used was Martin's Potato bread. I also cooked it in an 8x8 pan--it baked in the same amount of time as the recipe called for.

It was delicious! I followed someone else's advice and used 1c half and half in place of the milk and used 6 eggs instead of 4 for a richer egg texture. I also added half a green pepper, half an onion, and put some cheddar cheese on top for the last little bit.

I did use O'Brian hash brown potatoes instead of the bread, and added a chopped onion, green pepper, and fresh mushrooms.
Unfortunately,  I did not heed the reviews of others and used the full amount of milk when I doubled the recipe.
Took quite a while for the eggs to set, and it was too much liquid ... pooled on the plates.
Thought it was tasty, but I probably will not make it again.

This is old family tradition for my family also. Just a few differences. Add a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg to sausage with the mustard. 1 1/2 cup of half and half instead of milk. We use dry mustard most of the time but some use regular old mustard. Some of us add bacon crumbles with 5 minutes left. We use 6 eggs. I have done this without putting in fridge with bisquit halfs. (I was pregnant but omg amazing!) My fiance drizzles maple syrup on his slice of heaven as he often says when it comes to this yummy dish. Warms up great too. Add a little water to top before reheating. I'm gonna have to make this now! Thanks for sharing!

First of all I did change a few things which is why I only gave 4 stars but  I'm not sure what I did would've changed the flavor of the original recipe that much. I had some small plain bagels that I cut up and used instead of bread. I made sure the bottom of a 9x13 pan was covered  in bagel cubes. I forgot to count how many I cut up. I made the egg and milk mixture just as written. Used only 1/2 tsp mustard powder. Added onion to the sausage. So I layered the bagels first. Then put the sausage on top of the bagels. Poured the egg and milk mixture over the sausage and topped with Kraft casserole cheese. Put it in the refrigerator overnight. Next morning I baked according to the directions. In the last 15 min I broke some packaged pre cooked bacon up and put on top. The bacon came out nice and crisp and the casserole had a nice puff and color. The texture was perfect and not mushy with using the bagels. I was afraid it was going to be dry but it wasn't even close to dry. Just right. My guest loved it and had second helpings.

Fantastic recipe. I used thick slices of French bread on the bottom of the pan, rather than cutting them into cubes, and then poured everything over the top. I also added some hash browns as a personal preference. It was like a savory baked French toast, and the whole family loved it! Will absolutely make again.

Made this for while having a weekend bachelorette bash for my daughter.  Everyone loved it, and it disappeared quickly.  I appreciated how easy it was to assemble and that I could make it ahead of time.  Although I followed the recipe given, you could definitely change it up by adding onion, mushrooms, or other veggies, different cheeses or meats.  I will make this again!!

I followed the recipe exactly, just adding more seasoning than the Teaspoon called for and it turned out great!!! It got rave reviews from all who ate it. Even got one man in trouble with his wife because he loved it so much. And received an "A+" from my mother in law. I did freeze the casseroles. I cooked it exactly as recipe says and once it was done baking I let cool covered in plastic wrap and foil and froze it. Still turned out fantastic!! When frozen takes about 45-60 min to warm/heat up. I write directions to reheat on foil - REMOVE PLASTIC WRAP before reheating. Serves 8 people.

I make a double batch of this a couple of times a year for the worker bees at our semi-annual church rummage sale.  Also make a pan of monkey bread.   To this basic recipe, I add 4 sliced green onions, freshly grated pepper, and a can of Rotel.  I also reduce the milk from 4 to 3 cups for a double recipe.  Everyone looks forward to having breakfast mid morning after the initial rush.

I make a couple of variations of this. The first adaptation is strictly for convenience and speed. Instead of chopping up bread (which is the most time-consuming part) I buy a bag of turkey stuffing, and use that instead. It tends to add more volume, so I add another cup of milk and two more eggs. (I often use this with maple sausage, and use nutmeg and cinnamon instead of mustard. If you like things a bit sweet, two tablespoons of maple syrup works nicely also).  My other major variant is a vegetarian version -- also using the stuffing instead of bread. Instead of sausage I use sliced mushrooms and either diced bell or holland peppers, or else a bag of vegeteraian crumbles ground beef substitute. If you use the latter, add some additional spices, such as garlic salt and oregano.  I make these for my church about once a month and they are very popular.

I used mild Italian ground sausage and it gave a nice mild spicy taste.  Next time I think I will try adding diced red peppers and green onions to the mixture just to give it a bit more color.

Made it for a big group gathering. Heard from 3 separate couples how good it was. Only change I made was to up the egg count to 5.  I was using large eggs. After all the compliments, I made it for my family. It truly rates 5 stars with all of us.

It was super easy to prepare. I liked that I did most of the "work" the night before and just woke up and stuck it in the oven the next morning. Great for making breakfast for big crowds. I will definitely make this again.

I used 4 cups of left-over stuffing, added no spices or salt as stuffing was already seasoned, used turkey sausage and canned evaporated milk. It was tasty and very easy. As the stuffing was moist from being in a bird previously, I did not need to let the milk and egg soak into bread prior to baking. I baked it 45 min covered at 350 then reduced heat to 325 and continued baking for an additional 25 min. Perfect use of left over stuffing.

Great recipe!  I've made it with 6 slices of toasted white bread, and it was great.  I then tried it with the equivalent of cut up toasted french bread , and it was even better.   Thanks for sharing.

I really enjoyed this! But I didn't follow the instructions. Well, I didn't actually read them until it was too late. 8 hours in the fridge? More like 20 minutes in the freezer. Worked like a charm. Mixture set properly whilst cooking, everything tasted fine.

Took readers advise and used croutons instead of bread--bad idea.  As far as I was concerned it ruined the recipe.  My original recipe for this doesn't even toast the bread.  Think I will stick to that one.

The teen who put the casserole away the night before, spilled it in the refrigerator unbeknownst to us..so considering that the end result was quite tasty! We look forward to trying it with it's full flavor next time! Maybe adding some bacon as well.

The recipe reminds me of  sausage dressing, except with cheese. I would serve this for breakfast only if I were not serving turkey and dressing/stuffing as a later holiday meal, to avoid a redundancy in flavors of the day's menus. I used both toasted bread and plain croutons with sharp cheddar cheese. 

We like  spicy foods.  Next time, I would pop the flavor with a sprinkling of Cajun spice, and use hot breakfast sausage. (I might make it using  a blend of half hot sausage and half regular or sage sausage). It looks beautiful on the table. It was good the second day, so could be made ahead.

I made this for New Years and it was awesome.  My whole family loved it.  I made it per the recipe (though I didn't let it set overnight b/c I can't plan that far ahead, lol).  I am excited to try it again with the sage sausage suggestion.

I have been making the same basic recipe as this for years when I want a "brunch" type breakfast. It lends itself to many modifications--I have used bacon or leftover cooked roast instead of sausage, have added any combination of onion, mushrooms, frozen mixed veggies, or leftover cooked veggies. Also excellent with grated cheese sprinkled over the top and melted in as it cooks. No matter how I have modified it, this recipe has never failed me!

We loved this recipe. I did follow some of the other tips for changes  - like using garlic and cheddar croutons instead of the white bread. I used 2 glass 8x8's and doubled the recipe. I mixed 1 jimmy dean sausage and 1 jimmy dean maple sausage with onion. Used very little cheese, less greasy, and no extra salt or mustard powder ( I didn't have any). It was fantastic and my 12 year old said why can't we have this any time of year? I think that is proof that it was yummy! I'm sure the recipe as it's written is excellent as well. It's a great base to start from.

I used 1/2 lb sausage and 4 pieces of toast but otherwise followed the recipe.  I thought it was too salty.  I used "spicy italian pork sausage" maybe that was the reason.  I probably won't make this again.

I took some suggestions from other reviewers and added extra eggs and untoasted bread. I also added chopped green onions. This is a good recipe by itself but it's even better when you add more to it. I will be making this one again.

Family loved this!  I used 1 cup of half and half instead of milk.  I couldn't find my ground mustard, so I used about a tsp of Dijon and a tsp of yellow.  I used 6 eggs instead of 4.  I did not chill overnight, but allows the milk and egg mixture to make the bread "soggy."  I used Jimmy Dean sage sausage, 1 cup sharp cheddar, a little bit of mild cheddar and 2 thin slices of swiss cheese.  I baked it on 350 for 45 mins.

I made this for Christmas morning breakfast. This will be our  breakfast casserole of choice from here on!  It was delicious!  The only thing I did differently was to mix and bake the same morning as I lacked an ingredient to make it the night before.  It still turned out great!  Will be making again soon with some additions such as onions, peppers, maybe other spices.   Great basic recipe!

I made this for Christmas morning.  It was a hit with everyone.  I did add two more eggs and sprinkled more cheese on the top during the last 20 minutes so I didn't make it exactly as instructed.  I would definitely make it again.

Not sure I will make this again. I prefer breakfast casserole with more of an egg base. This was a bit too "bready" for me. Overall flavor was pretty good.

Followed some reviewers advice and upped it to 6 eggs. I added a sprinkling of onion powder for seasoning. It came out well but I cooked it in a deeper casserole dish so it required about 30 minutes longer than stated on the recipe. The whole family enjoyed it.

One big question, what if you did not prep the night before?  I lined the pyrex with bread (hot dog buns!!!) Used 1 cup halfnhalf and 1 cup milk, 2 bags kraft shredded cheese (16oz?  Normal size that there are tons of at the store).  I mixed everthing in a bowl with half of cheese, poured over buns,patted down a bit, sprinkled rest of cheese on top and followed baking instructions.  Everyone loved it, no 8 hr soak!

Followed recipe to the tee.   Rather tasteless, needed more salt and pepper.  No idea the purpose of dry mustard. Sorry I wasted the time $$.  Thankfully it was just for hubby & self. This would have been a real embarrassment .

4 cups of croutons work well in this recipe in place of bread cubes. They also add additional flavor. My teens were not too fond of this recipe, but the adults gave it rave reviews.

Dang I wish I would have found this recipe 24 hours earlier. The first time I made it was Thanksgiving and I just didn't have 8 hours or overnight to spare. I ended up making it as is and only had about an hour to let it sit. It was good but I am now curious to see how much better overnight does for it. It is now Christmas eve and the casserole is in the frig to pop in the oven for Christmas morning.

I made this last year for the family for Christmas morning.  I didn't read all of the instructions before I started it on Christmas morning...oops.  When I got to the part where it said to let the mixture set overnight I almost cried.  I decided to just go ahead and make it anyway, and it was DELICIOUS!!  Everyone loved it!  And, yes, I'm making it this year and hopefully for many more to come.

Easy and quite good. I think it could use a little more spice. I used homemade croutons which turned out well. Next day, I warmed and poured some salsa and slice of cheese over and it was a great lunch!

Very good.  I did use 6 eggs instead of the 4. I also added a bit of green onion, but only because I wanted to use it up. It would have been just as good without it.

I prepared this casserole the evening before Thanksgiving so we could have it for our holiday breakfast.  It was very easy to put together and my family raved about how delicious it was!

I did not add the dry mustard powder, as this is something I don't use often and did not have on hand.... it was obviously not missed.

It turned out extremely salty.  Next time:

-I will skip the salt since a lot of flavor comes from the sausage.  -I will replace the toast with potatoes or hash browns for some crunch and to balance out the flavors.

So I wanted to love it based on all the reviews, but we didn’t.  I made it as written except I didn’t toast the bread....which quite honestly I just forgot to do.  I didn’t care for the texture of the bread and we both thought it would do better with either biscuits or English muffins.   I thought the texture of the bread would’ve been great had it been a bread pudding with cinnamon.

Thumbs up for the use of sausage.  Too much bread for my liking.

Excellent!  I added some sliced green onion and used 4 toasted hamburger buns but other than that left the recipe alone.

I made this for breakfast for 9 people and we all raved about it.  The modifications I used were 6 eggs, Jimmy Dean Sage sausage, and cheese/garlic croutons instead of bread.

I made this exactly as it was written in the recipe, and it just wasn't that great. The consistency is just weird. I think it calls for too much milk. The flavor is decent, but I think it could use some more seasoning. I might make this again, but I would definitely make several changes.

Simple, basic - this time I used diced pre-cooked turkey sausage but next time I would recommend sausage crumbles.  I also used herbed bread and that was kind of fun but I wouldn't do it every time.  The recommended cooking time seems a bit long...

This has turned into a special occasion staple in my house.  The only adjustment I make is I double the amount of eggs for my large family and add one extra cup of milk.  All my kids request this on holidays or birthdays.  Thanks so much!

It may not look glamorous but it's tasty! I wasn't able to let it sit in the fridge for long (maybe only 45 mins) but it still came out tasting great. My only suggestion would be to make a double batch, as it's so incredibly easy and was a huge hit (plus makes for awesome leftovers).

I did not toast the bread; I used loaf ends. I put in 1 2/3 cup milk and it was not soggy.  Used turkey sausage... definitely a winner.

Gotta say, this recipe is super flexible! I substituted Turkey Sausage, Cashew Milk, and provolone cheese because that was what I had on hand. Still delicious results!

I also only ended up using four slices of bread.

I tried to like this. Everyone tried. It just wasn't very good at all. I followed the recipe, except I used croutons instead of bread, like so many people had suggested.
 It got an extra star for the ingredients. The ingredients are tasty, but it just doesn't taste well all together.

My kids don't like too many different ingredients, so I chose this recipe for the simplicity of what goes in it. It was a hit! Not too often do I get all three kids to eat what I make from scratch (I'm a great cook, just weird kids), but everyone went back for second helpings. 
I added more eggs for a total of 7. I kept the amount of toasted (wheat) bread, sausage, milk, and cheese the same. I did a little more mustard and salt, and added black pepper. I love spice so I ate mine with sambal, perfection!

Excellent recipe. Listened to reviews, used croutons (1oz to replace each slice of bread) to avoid it being mushy. Turned out perfect the two times that I have made it. Used spicy sausage and it was great!!!

I made it with hot sausage but the sweet would probably taste better. Ed said to add hot chiles next time.

Omitted the salt.  Used seasoned croutons which turned out great but would really like to use what others suggested- The Marie Callendar cheddat croutons.  Will definitely make this again- so easy and so good.  Used sharp cheddar.  It seemd like the sausage would overpower the dish with only 4 eggs so I used 10..... perfect ratio and filled a 9X13 just right.

My family loves this casserole.  I made a few changes by adding six slices of cooked crumbled bacon, 1-1/2 cups of half and half, instead of milk, 10 eggs, bunch of green onions , 12 oz of cheese, and used a package of Hawaiian rolls.  This version is full of calories, therefore, I only make it on special occasions.

Very good. Used the suggestions of hash browns which I quickly pan fried and also added a couple more eggs.   This recipe would be highly dependent on the quality of sausage so this is not the time to skimp

This is a great recipe. Changes I made: used 7 eggs, eliminated salt, used 4 slices of toasted Texas toast.. Needed a little more than 2 cups of milk. So easy, love making it, everyone goes back for more.

I love this recipe! This was first indroduced to me by a friend who brought it over as a Christmas present one year on Christmas Eve. Since then, I have remade it multiple times with only a few modifications to give it more flavor. In the egg mixture I add about 1/2 teaspoon of Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning and 1/4 teaspoon of dried dill. For the sausage I used the maple flavor sausage for Jimmy Dean. This combination gives it a sweet and spicy edge, that is just soo addictive.

I looked at so many recipes for a breakfast casserole before I decided on this one.  It did not disappoint.  Only change I made was that I used 1 cup of half and half, and half a cup of milk to soak overnight, and then stirred in a half cup of milk before baking.  I used a smaller pan to make the slices thicker, and cooked it an additional 20 minutes.  Fantastic, and our guests loved it.  Great recipe!

Great dish!  Made this for my daughters sleep over at school.  Made one pan with sausage links browned in oven then cut up and one with bacon cut up and added extra cheese.  This dish can easily be changed up to your liking (add ham or turkey sausage instead).  I didn't have time to brown top but it looked and tasted great!  Would make a great light dinner with salad too.

I used Leah's revamp of two extra eggs and half milk half heavy cream and the suggestion of one reg sausage and one sage sausage. Probably twice the amount of cheese. used 5 cups hash browns instead of toast.  Use another cup or two if you want more potato. Will definitely make again and again.

I made 5 casseroles for Christmas breakfast. This one was intended for the people who were looking for something straight forward (i.e. no fruit, no veggies). This one was the last one I sampled and I have to say, it was great. Everybody loved it and it was a crowd pleaser for sure.

Super easy and moist and juicy. I used pretzel rolls which I toasted and buttered, then cubed. I'm making this for my office tomorrow morning!

Really yummy and possibly even better reheated.  I also split the milk with half and half (a cup of each) and added one extra egg.

Sounded like it would be delicious, I found it bland. Adding jalapeno sauce helped but didn't save it. Won't be making it again.

This was good but not anything exceptional that I would serve on Christmas day.  I increased the eggs to 6, reduced the bread to 4 slices and used seasoned salt.  I may try it again with hashbrown instead of bread.  The 9x13 dish was the perfect size.  I baked it uncovered for 45 minutes and it was done.

This is a very tasty casserole. I made a few small modifications to it so it's even healthier for me. I like to make it and keep on hand for a quick protein packed, low calorie breakfast. I'm an exercise junkie and this is perfect! Thanks for sharing a super delicious recipe.

This is AMAZING.  I followed recommendations of other reviewers, and used croutons instead of bread.  I doubled the recipe, and used two bags of flavored croutons--one garlic and butter and the other was garlic and cheese.  I used 8 eggs, but only used 2 cups of milk and maybe 2/3 cup of half-and-half.  I only used one pound of sausage, too, which was enough.  The only addition I made was adding chopped green onions on top, and putting a bit more cheese on top of the casserole for the final 15 minutes.  It cooked much faster for me than written.  It baked for 45 min covered, and only 15 min uncovered.  Absolutely amazing.  Everyone loved it, and it's so easy!  I made it on NYE to have ready to bake on New Years morning.  This will be made again soon--my kids are already asking for more!

Great recipe with some minor changes.  I used two bags of garlic and cheese croutons (will use 1.5 bags next time) instead of white bread, Jimmy Dean maple sausage cooked with 1/3 c. diced onion, maybe six eggs, omitted the salt (croutons salty enough), used an 11x7 pan, and added additional cheese to the top during the last ten minutes of baking.  When I previously made this, I tried layering the bread on the bottom as another reviewer suggested, but that created a hard, unappetizing crust that didn’t work well with the dish; I much prefer everything mixed together.  As a note, make sure you grease your pan WELL; the casserole likes to stick.  I really like that this recipe can accommodate heavy customization; I may try a bacon version next time or try a healthier veggie version.  Thanks!

I followed the recipe to a T except added 6 eggs instead of 4 per other reviewers. I have to admit I was a bit surprised by all the glowing reviews. I've had FAR better breakfast casseroles before... I thought there was way too much pork and bread and not enough egg. If I had a do-over, I'd have used 4 slices of bread instead of 6, and 2/3 lb pork instead of 1lb, and 8 eggs instead of 4.  And I'd perhaps add a 4oz can of green chilis.

My family really liked it and I made it Christmas morning so that was a gamble.. but they all loved it.. it was the perfect amount for 6 ppl.. I made it just like the recipe and didn't change a thing. I might try to add extra ingredients maybe some peppers or bacon or I might keep it just as it..

I made a double batch; used 1 pound of original sausage and 1 lb. of sage sausage as recommended by the OP.  I made 2 trays: 1 was the original recipe and 1 was modified for the gluten-intolerant crowd.  For the second tray, I used diced redskin potatoes (skins left on).  I probably had about 3 cups of redskin potatoes.  I also used a can of fat free cream of mushroom soup , and used 6 ounces of milk (skim).  The potato version actually disappeared faster than the original recipe; to me, it had more flavor.
Even the super-picky eaters gobbled this one down.

Fantalamisimo!!!  The whole family scarfed it up.

Because I can't eat gluten I baked up premade potato patties according to directions, then tore them up into the mixture.  Added a bit of green onion and some hot peppers to the top; otherwise, made as directed and LOVE IT!!!  Served it with guacamole, sour cream & salsa.  MERRRRRY CHRISTMAS!

I think the potato was a fab addition as it made it more substantial and at least added a bit more nutrition than white bread would  (A bit, lol!)

Thanks for the fabulous recipe!!!

I just made this today!  I was going to make a recipe that called for frozen hash browns..... My daughter forgot to buy the hash browns!  So I looked this up really quick for a replacement and quick with what I had on hand.  The only thing differently I did, I did NOT refrigerate first; just browned, mixed,  and threw in the oven!!   It was easy,  quick.......and it was yummy.  This is going to be a new Christmas morning tradition!

This recipe is a good start but next time I will make some changes. As written it makes too thin a layer in the prescribed pan. I will add eggs and layer the ingredients in the pan instead of mixing them all up.

Absolutely loved this and will be a staple for us! Just a little tweaks after reading other reviews...I used 6 slices of TOASTED brioche bread cubed, 6 eggs with less milk, 1 cup half n half and 1/2 cup milk. I used LESS salt since I also used spicy Jimmy Dean sausage and added fresh finely chopped rosemary. You can also use ANY veggies along with your sausage...I used green and red bell peppers with onion. I was so scared to put it all together over night but I baked it just like the recipe calls for the next day....Awesome!

This was delicious!  Made it for xmas eve morning, so i wouldnt have to spend all my time in the kitchen!
I made a few changes per suggestions, but after trying them, im sure the regular recipe would be just fine too!  I also made a bigger batch, in a 12 X 10 pan so I used more ingredients...

i used 6 slices of cut up Italian bread (crusts on), and also added a bag of cheesy garlic croutons.  I put these items on the bottom of the pan.  Then i cooked 2 tubes of jimmy dean sausage, adding a diced onion at the end and a can of diced green chilies. i layered those items on top of the bread and croutons in pan.  Then i added the cheese to the top....i didnt measure that, i just covered the top nicely, and called it good.  Then i whisked 12 eggs with 1 cup of half and half, some "slap your mama" seasoning, and pepper, and poured that all on top of the cheese mixture to sit overnight in the fridge.  I set it out in the morning for 1/2 an hour before baking, and then baked for 1 hour covered, then removed the foil and baked for another 40 minutes.  It was delicious!  I honestly couldnt taste the difference between the bread pieces (that werent toasted) and the crouton pieces, as far as texture goes, so i guess its a personal preference.  The cheesy garlic croutons did add a nice flavor though, so i would definitely use them again.  I know i strayed from the recipe a bit, but i think this is a great starter recipe for you to tweak as you like...but that being said, i do think the re

I followed a few suggestions from other users and increased the eggs from 4 to 6, used a whole bag of Garlic and Herb stuffing mix from Pepperidge Farms. I also added 1# bacon as well since we love bacon so much. I am going to try again with 10 eggs since it seemed to be bread-heavy with the bag of stuffing mix and only 4 eggs. It will be made again soon.

I've been making this recipe on Christmas morning for many years.  My family loves it and looks forward to Christmas breakfast.  I usually make two pans, one with regular breakfast sausage and one with hot sausage for my Italian family that likes things really spicy.

I have been making a similar recipe to this for years.  I use 8 eggs and 8 slices of bread.  Can always change the sausage up for a pound of bacon.  Also, try adding some onion, green pepper and mushrooms.  This is always a hit!!!

This is a great recipe and would be perfect for a Christmas brunch. I only made half the recipe and used a 9.5X7.5 inch casserole dish.  I did double the amount of eggs as some reviewers suggested and used alfresco country style chicken sausage and Udi's gluten-free white bread toasted. The extra eggs are just a personal preference and I think this recipe would also be great staying true to the original egg amount. Because I halved the recipe, I baked it covered at 350 for 45 minutes and uncovered at 325 for about 25 minutes.

I have made this over and over again doubled in quantity.  It's a hit every time.  I add stir fried veggies to half and leave the other just as the recipe is.  Both versions are a hit with the immediate family and extended relatives.

I've made this twice now, both times rave reviews. The first time used six eggs, the second time I cut one slice of bread, used 8 eggs, and used a mix of cheeses I had and added scallions. I do used very good whole grain hearty bread so maybe that's why it was too much.  I was told this is the best breakfast casserole ever and had many requests for the recipe - Thank you!!!

We have this every Christmas morning, and usually Thanksgiving morning also. Love the leftovers.  The only change I make is to use Jimmy Dean's HOT breakfast sausage roll.  Gives a little more taste.  Course, being from Texas, we put salsa over it after taking it on our plates.

After making it once I made the following adjustments. I substituted 1/2 & 1/2 for the milk, hashbrowns for the bread, and upped the sausage to 1 1/2 lbs. Will definitely make it this way again.

used 1 bag of garlic cheese croutons and 3 slices of bread, my oven cooked this way more quickly than the recipe suggests (so mine was a little overdone).  Maybe a 7 x 11 pan would have been better?  Used maple sausage as a few people suggested...just wasn't impressed.  Maybe we should try this again though

I made this for a Christmas brunch, and it was absolutely delicious! It's very simple and tasty. I didn't have any ground sausage on hand, so I just tossed some thawed heat-and-serve sausages in the food processor. That makes it even faster to prepare since you can skip the 1st step of browning the meat!

It tasted like a large omelet.  A little less salt would make it better and maybe some rotel.

Gotta say this us the best egg casserole I've ever had!
Very impressed
I used 1 cup of half n half because the dish can become too soggy. I also used 6 eggs for richer egg flavor.

Recipe is good base but this was so bland even my wife who cannot eat spicy foods complained how dull it is.  So next time I make it, will add a few things to it like green onions, paprika, and pepper.

This was good.  It also freezes well. We cooled and cut into portions and then froze just for convenience sake.  If you reheat covered in a 350 degree oven until warmed through it works really good.  However, if you try to take a microwave shortcut all I can say is beware!  Not so good! We did use italian seasoned croutons for the bread. Very tasty.

This recipe was a huge success! I didn't have to cook Christmas morning and my mother and mother-in-law told me they had to have the recipe! I used 6 eggs instead of 4 and a little more than 8oz of cheese, but followed the rest and it was great. Thin I started a Amoy tradition for Christmas morning :)

The end result of explicitly following these directions, except for cooking 10 min longer, was just terrible. If you are one who has a remote food texture issue, as in not a fan of runny eggs over toast, then you to are likely to find this inedible.I did manage to save it by browning the heck out of it in quarters over medium-high heat in a skillet. I smooched it flat and just kept breaking it up and flattening. It took browning it this way until it was almost burnt to get rid of the raw, squishy egg texture the bread cubes held on to. 4 star dish taste wise afterwards. Not pretty visually. First time I've strongly disagreed with so many positive reviews. Won't make again.

I made this for Christmas this year and it was fantastic. I used 4 large leftover croissants in an 8x8 glass baking dish. I upped the eggs to 5 and decreased the milk to 1.5 cups. My husband loved it!

Good, but kind of bland for my family.  I halved the recipe and it came out perfect.  Next time will do as other reviews suggested and add some chiles and use spice sausage.

For our personal taste, 1/2 pound of sausage would have been enough. I cooked about 1/4 cup chopped onion with the sausage. Go light on the salt! Increase the egg by one and use one more slice of bread. Cooked in a 7" x 12" pan.

A triumph as always! I doubled the recipe since I was feeding seven people and it all disappeared fast. Like most people, I don't toast the bread and use more eggs and less milk. Perfect, easy meal for an family get together.

We had this for our Christmas breakfast and it was super easy and yummy. We plan to make this a new tradition. We made it as written but other ingredients could easily be added. The recipe seems very adaptable.

I was excited to try this recipe. Months before Christmas I had it on my list for Christmas morning. I made this recipe exactly as it is written....and was so disappointed. The flavor was bland and the texture was weird. I mean, it was okay....maybe something I would make camping but not for Christmas.

This is a terrific recipe.  I served it for Christmas breakfast this morning.  Did not have ground mustard; used yellow prepared mustard instead.  Used link turkey sausage and cut into bite size pieces.  Used whole wheat toast.  Seasoned with pepper on top and green onion.  Green Tabasco on the table to liven it up a touch.  Served with mimosas, Christmas bread, and satsumas.

I thought this recipe was very tasty.  I will definitely add some onions next time for flavor, but overall everyone really liked it.  I didn't want to wait an hour and a half for it to bake so I baked it at 375 for 45 min then took the foil off and baked at 350 for another 25 min.  It was very yummy.

I love this recipe with Maple sausage. I live alone so I make half a recipe. Honestly I find that with the flavorful sausage and some chopped green onions, I dont need much cheese if any at all. (I'm a cheese lover) I usually use 3 eggs and a little more bread. I don't toast the bread but I mix everything up in a bowl then let it sit for at least 4 hours. (I tried it with the croutons but I liked it better with bread) Stir again before cooking.  I think it has great flavor and god leftovers for the next few mornings for me!

Made this for Christmas this past year and still think about when I can find an excuse to make it again.  It was SO good....I only made one pyrex 9x13 size and it was gone in about 5 minutes flat.  I will definitely be making 2 next time! Also, the mustard makes it really yellow which you think cant possibly be right, but it is, and it is so incredibly delicious!!

Quite tasty, I used the exact recipe but used 2 cups milk and 6 eggs, since I have a big crew to feed. They really liked it, but I wouldn't cook it so long. While the edges had a good crisp, the rest was a bit dry

Family loved it - I found it a little greasy. Maybe I added too much cheese. Will make it again.

I was running 4 for 4 success rate on my allrecipe projects, so was hopeful for this one too.  I agree with another reviewer who said we could have just made scrambled eggs, toast and sausage pre-cut patties the morning of and saved ourselves all the trouble.  This was just ok but not something I would reorder at a restaurant so certainly not what I would invest time into making again.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe except for the sausage and bread. ( I used turkey instead of pork). I also used sourdough bread instead of white. So good on christmas morning.

I doubled the recipe. I used a pound of bacon and half a pound of maple sausage, less milk and more eggs (about 3 1/2 cups milk and 10 eggs) It was fantastic for Christmas morning. We all LOVED it even the picky kids! Thanks for sharing this recipe! Sheryl

I followed this recipe exactly, except I didn't have any sausage, so I used 3?4 ound of cooked, cut up bacon. This was great! I wasn't sure about the cooking time, but I followed the directions and it turned out great. I really prefer this recipe over my usual breakfast casserole recipe. After it cooled a bit, I could cut it into wedges and serve it almost like a quiche. This is a great addition to my usual breakfast menu. Thanks for sharing!

This was super easy to put together the night before. I used sourdough bread, toasting it in the toaster before cubing.  Also I could only find sage sausage.   I did cook it at a higher temp for a little less time the  second part of the cooking since it was sharing the oven with the monkey bread.  Likely to be out go Christmas morning casserole.

My family did not like this recipe.  It was bland and did not taste very good.  I have been making Christmas Morning Pie (another recipe you can find on this website) for several years.  I wanted to change things up this year, and decided to try this recipe. I will never make this again.  The texture was okay but the flavor was bland!  Nobody ate it.

I make this recipe regularly for my family... I have tweeked it to make it absolutely fantastic.. First, I use Jimmy Dean HOT sausage. For the bread, I use sourdough bread and just tear it to fill the entire bottom of the pan.  I let it sit overnight, or freeze it if it will be several days... The morning of the breakfast, I take one can of cream of Mushroom soup, and mix it with 1/2 of can of milk and pour over the casserole.  I cook until it is hot and bubbly... absolutely delicious now!!

The casserole was okay. but i altered the ingredients a little, so if i stuck closer to the original recipe, than it probably would have been better. i used maple sausage, added onions, mushrooms, 1 1/2 bags of garlic and cheese croutons and 8 eggs. should have had more eggs and less croutons. 9x11 casserole dish was fine.

I made this casserole for a Christmas brunch for my family.It was an instant hit. It is a great recipe however I did tweak it to make it a bit more flavorful. I doubled the recipe and used wheat bread instead of white, added 1/2 cup of onion, green bell pepper & red bell pepper to sausage while cooking & used Kroger brand casserole cheese blend.

Very tasty, very filling! I made this on Christmas night and discovered I had no ground pork sausage. I sliced up pork sausage links and hoped for the best. I baked it in my toaster oven and it looked lovely and brown after 45 minutes. It turned out beautifully.

Great recipe for leftover croutons!  We made ours dairy free
By subbing unsweetened coconut milk for milk and skipped the cheese....still
Delish because we loaded ours up with sauteed beef summer sausage, 
Onions, mushrooms, green beans and sauteed pepperoni. We also
Erred and disnt cover whilecooking, but it still came out
Moist , but took about 30 mins less.  This is so easy, light
And delish.  I look forward to making more and playing
With the recipe to try new combinations.

I make this recipe all the time and love it. I do not cover when cooking.  I wonder what the difference would be if I covered.  Also it is very full(high) in the dish at the end of cooking time but after
taking it out of the oven it becomes flat.  Is it because I did not
cover?

This was super easy to assemble and was a delicious breakfast this morning. I put it in the oven just as we started to open presents, and it was ready right around the time we were starting to get hungry. I used Andouille sausage because we like things spicy, but I think any kind of sausage meat would work. Next time I might add some thin strips of sun-dried tomato, or some green and red peppers, but this is definitely going to be a Christmas tradition around here!

YUM!  It was easy and it was very tasty!  I'm not a big sausage fan either but I will be making this again.  The only variation I made (being a first timer breakfast casserole maker) was to add 2 extra eggs to make it more eggy as some others suggested. It was fabulous!  I baked it about 50 mins at 350 and about 25 at 325 (in a 9x14 pan).

Made this yesterday, not one of my favorite's, don't know why you have to put it in the fridge overnight unless it is to save time hubby liked it won't be making it very often perhaps thats why this is a once a year recipe? I did add some mushrooms that was the best part for me.

This is a great recipe & very versatile.  I like mine a little richer, so I use 6 eggs and substitute milk for half & half.  You can substitute the sausage with bacon or broccoli (or use a combination).  Thank you!

We enjoyed this on Christmas Eve morning.  A nice basic recipe.  I added two pinches of dried cilantro; next time, I would use fresh or add a couple more pinches to spice it up.  This is a shallow recipe (about an inch thick in a 9x13 pan), so not overbearing and huge.  Nice portions.  Easy to make.

We do this as well but use peameal bacon and a dash of worcestershire sauce instead of sausage and mustard.  We just line a 9X13 pan with the slices of bread and then the meat (raw) and pour the egg mixture over.  Top with shredded cheese and some pepper and it is great.  Make the night before and pop it in the oven when you get up and it is then ready in about an hour.

My family loves this dish. It has been our family tradition for 20 years. I add 1 1/2 -2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese, mushrooms and green pepper. I also use 6 eggs and only 1 cup of milk. I never toast the bread and don't think it would make a difference-Denise

Delicious! I used leftover rosemary herb french bread and maple breakfast sausage. I cooked the sausage in my toaster oven then cut off the casing and ground it up. I put 1/2 cup of cheese in the mixture and the remaining on top. I ended up storing this in the fridge for two days before I cooked it. It was a little dry so I added more milk before the final cooking stage. Yummy with minor changes.

Made with ham instead of sausage to cut calories. Had good flavor, but I prefer more eggs.

This recipe is great!  My whole family enjoys it and there's never leftovers.  Sometimes we add onion or mushrooms, or just anything we are in the mood for that day.  Thanks

Very good casserole for ANY time of the year.  My tweeking would be:  1 1/2 pds sausage, 6-8 eggs, thick Texas toast-style bread cubes, and extra cheese!  Yum!  This is nice to have in the morning to just pop in the oven and have a tasty, hearty breakfast or brunch meal.

I wasn't overly impressed with this casserole, my bread was very soggy despite using less milk and more eggs. The flavor was very good if you could get over the bread part. I think I will try it again and instead of bread I will use baking mix to put drop biscuits on top and reduce the milk even more. I think that would be much better, the biscuits will not be sitting in the egg mixture so they should be a nice compliment.

This is a delicious casserole!  Very easy to make.  We loved it as is, but next time will add a little green onion or some diced jalapeno.   Thanks for sharing this recipe with us.

This was wonderful.  I used hot country sausage and  sourdough bread. I did use 6 eggs and 1 1/2 cups milk so it was a little more eggy.   It was a little greasy when I first took it out of the oven, but as it cooled a little it was perfect.  I will definately make this again.

I did not like the texture of the bread with this meal.  I was expecting something a little more "eggy".  I did add an egg and also some bacon and used the maple sausage.  My sister really liked this recipe but the bread and texture threw me off of it.  Sorry.

Delicious!   I like how you toast the bread first and cut into cubes.     I used sourdough bread and the maple sausage others had suggested.    I also added 1/2 onion chopped and sauted in butter with a package of sliced mushrooms.    YUM!   Thanks for the recipe!

Superb flavor.  Except for not toasting the bread cubes (I used day old Italian bread; crust removed - toasting wasn't a necessary process) and added a 4.5-oz jar of sliced mushrooms (personal preference) to the crumbled sausage as it cooked. I made no other changes.  This is a recipe the family has requested to be made often.

This casserole was just ok.  I didn't think it had much flavor.  I'm sure it would have been better if I had added in some veggies, more meat etc.  I have an different breakfast casserole recipe that I like much better.

I always double the recipe in my 9x13 so it is a thicker casserole.  Follow recipe, but often use maple sausage, so it tastes sort of like french toast casserole. Never any complaints--useful to let it come to room temp about 1/2 before baking it. LOVE IT--I make it often.

I thought this was good, my husband went back for seconds (and thirds).  Next time, I think I will decrease the amount of bread, as the consistency was more like a bread pudding (versus a egg casserole or quiche, which was what I expected).  I will definitely take others advice and experiment with ham/ red peppers, broccoli, asparagus, jalapenos....skies the limit!

This was great - I used Cabot 75% fat free cheddar, garlic cheese croutons and 8 eggs.  I prepared on Thanksgiving morning for guests, and have since made it several times for supper paired with spinach salad.  Easy to prepare in the morning and pop in the oven in the evening!

Excellent dish.  I made this for my husband and his friends for the morning of their golf outing.  The changes I made were adding real bacon pieces and cubed ham.  I left out the onions because I didn't have any and based on other reviews, I used 6 eggs and about 1 1/2 cups of milk.  The guys said it was awesome!

too bland for us even after I made changes. I added sage to sausage and added green chilies to egg mixture. Didn't have cheddar cheese so used processed cheese singles.  Only had wheat bread...I would suggest white/sourdough.  Not what I was looking for, will keep looking.

Super easy to make and my friends and family cannot get enough of it. Make sure to put this in the fridge over night to set up. I made a couple of other changes including using a total of 6 eggs, and 1 tsp. of dried minced onion and a pinch of black pepper. I have made it without the mustard powder and it is just as good.

I made this up and left in the fridge overnight. The next morning, before anyone was up, I popped it in the over. It worked out perfectly! My daughter liked this so much that she had three helpings over the course of a day. It saves nicely, too! We made it with bacon instead of sausage, but everything else remained the same.

Very good!  I made this with mild sausage, 6 eggs, and 8 slices of plain white bread (not toasted), baked uncovered for 45 mins.  Everyone liked it, but it was better with picante sauce.  Next time, I would use more sausage, and maybe spicy sausage instead of mild.

This recipe was excellent. I served it at a family brunch and modified it alittle by using 5 eggs, 2 3/4c milk, 8 slices of bread and topped it with 2 cups of crushed cornflakes with 1/2 cup of melted butter mixed with them.

I have made this several times now for different groups.  I use maple and sage flavored sausage.  I think it was good but not impressive because no one asked for the recipe.  But I will be making it for myself anyways

This recipe is always is a crowd pleaser!  I have made it many, many times and I am always asked for the recipe.  Being in Texas my family likes things spicy, so I use hot sausage.  It's too good to keep just for Christmas; make it anytime!

Tasty and easy! It was so nice to have a great breakfast ready to go on Christmas morning. We used 6 eggs because of the other reviews. My mother tried it another time but added the maple flavor sausage that others suggested. She didn't like that one as much. I think this will be a tradition! Thanks for sharing.

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out GREAT.  Made it for Christmas morning and my family loved it - every bit was gone!  I used Sage sausage because it was what I had, next time will use Maple because that sounds wonderful!
Thank you for this one!

We have made this recipe for the past two Christmas morning breakfasts. Make the night before & pop in the oven the next morning. Consistently excellent tasting, can experiment with flavored sausage or hot sauce. This is a family favorite!

This was so good!  My mom used to make this type of breakfast casserole for Christmas but she used toast, which always came out soggy.  Eventually, she gave up perfecting it the toast and started using shredded hash browns.  The crescent rolls in this dish were not soggy at all!  They were perfect and added an unexpected taste to the typical breakfast casserole which my fiancé and I both loved.  I recommended this one to mom who’s excited to give it a try!

Made this for Christmas morning and got pretty good reviews. I used sage sausage and the family thought that the sage flavor was a bit overpowering. Next time I will use regular sausage or the Maple flavored that so many other reviewers recommended. I increased the eggs to 6 and used half and half instead of the milk and then only used 1 cup. I sauteed an onion in with the sausage. The dish was very easy to put together and cook up beautifully. Will be making this again but will make above mentioned changes and perhaps add the cayenne and red and green peppers for more flavor. We all agreed that salsa would have been a nice addition to have on the side with it.

I made this for Christmas brunch, we had a house full. By the time I was able to eat it was GONE! While I personally wasn't able to try it, my family said that it was great. It was also VERY easy to prepare. I made it exactly to the directions. Thanks!!

Family enjoyed this; I made it in a stoneware 8"x8" pan. During the last 10 mins. I put those canned fried onions and sharp cheddar on top. The edges were a little "done" but edible. Thanks for the post!

OK, after reading all the reviews, I did the following to this recipe. I used 6 eggs, used 1/2 half and half, put it in a smaller dish, put the toasted bread crumbs on the bottom, and added onions and mushrooms to the sausage. The bread crumbs on the bottom burned, I decided that was because i used a smaller pan and it took longer for the mixture to solidify, thus burning the bottom. All the rest was very tasty, the only thiongs i would change would be to use a bigger pan and to mix the bread crumb in the egg mixture as directed. I will try this recipe again.

I've made this multiple times, some times for that day and a time or two I allowed it to set overnight.  No matter how it was done it always came out tasty.  I have never toasted the bread.  I have used whole slices, used a French loaf torn into chunks and simply cubed bread slices (with scissors).  Prepared as instructed and now with my own modifications.  I use about eight (8) slices of bread and just as many eggs.  I use whatever milk I have on hand -non-fat, half and half, soy or almond milk.   I do add a tiny bit of garlic powder for a savory dish.  When I have cinnamon raisin bread on hand I like to use the maple flavored sausage.   I can say this is a great dish without any enhancements but it's just such a perfect recipe to add a touch "of yourself".  YUM!!!  
 
Thank you to the reviewers for all their suggested enhancements.  

01252011 - Doubled the recipe, used an entire loaf of hard, day old French bread, made 2 casseroles, one with Hatch chilis and 1 without.  Added sausage AND leftover ham from a previous dinner.  I think the guys are really gonna LOVE it this time.

Also made this for christmas morning. I read all the tweeks everyone did to this recipe and did a little of my own. I used only 1 cup of milk, added green onion, added pepper, and used 7 eggs (thats what i had on hand so used them all).  I forgot to spray the pan, realizing this while laying in bed after putting it together.  DONT FORGET TO SPRAY YOUR PAN!  the recipe came out good. hubby loved it said not to change anything.  i still might tweek it some more for added flavor only.  the texture for us came out perfect.

We loved this dish.  I made it for xmas morning  2007 and it is now a tradition.  The kids gobbled it up.  I substituted half and half (1 1/4 cups) for milk and I used 8 eggs.  I also added the green onion.  Ill use sharp cheddar next time instead of the mild.  I also used the maple flavored sausage and that made the dish!!!

I made this recipe for our local MOPS group.  I have to admit, this was hardly touched compared to other recipes I have brought before.  This recipe is bland.  I used leftover beer bread (which actually made this have some kind of flavor).  Increased eggs to 6 (highly recommend!!!)  I will say this was MUCH better when accompanied with salsa!!  I will make this one again, but add salsa on the side.

Excellent.  Made the following changes: used a 10 oz. package of brown & serve sage breakfast links, 8 eggs, & 12 oz. regular cheddar.  Reheated well.  Will make again soon!

Delicious and easy.  It seems like there was not enough eggs in it at first, but it ends up being the right amount.

Great flavor and very easy.  I added 2 more eggs and used leftover french baquette instead of white bread.  Be sure to get up early because it takes a while to cook.

This was very good - I actually made it for a weeknight dinner.  I didn't toast the bread so it wouldn't have to sit in the fridge over night and I was able to bake it right away.  I decreased the cooking time to about 35-40 minutes.  The only thing I would change is to add 2 more eggs and put the cheese on top near the end of the baking time (the cheese burned and stuck to the bottom of the pan really bad even though I greased it very liberally).

Great recipe.  However  one time I did not have the exact ingredients so I used garlic croutons at the bottom of the pan, chopped up green onions and chopped up some spam (my grandfather loved spam) that was put on top of the croutons, then one package of cheddar cheese on top of that, and then the egg mixture over the whole batch.  And if you have a real finicky eater or child when you serve it put a light cover of syrup on top of it.

Great recipe--used it for Mother's Day and for a casual breakfast with friends. I followed the advice of past reviewers--started with a box of Marie Callender's garlic cheese croutons on the bottom, added the sausage next, then 2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese (I like a lot of cheese!), then 6 eggs mixed with 1 cup of half and half. For mother's day, I added a layer of sauteed onions, green peppers, and mushrooms and cut the sausage in half. I liked the one with the vegetables better.

This recipe is wonderful! I used it for a dish at a baby shower brunch and people could not get enough of it! i have made it three times now...on the third time I decided to subtract some fat and I used egg beaters in place of 1/2 of the eggs and reduced the cheese by a 1/3. It was very good!

I thought I would make this really Christmasy and add 2 tbsp each chopped red pepper and green onions.  It looked very nice but we were sort of divided half and half on it's taste value, I really thought some more spices were needed and that would make it great. Update, gave it a go again, a couple more eggs, more bread, minced onions, seasoning salt and a little more mustard, much, much better!

This recipe was good, but my family didn't really like the bread in it. My husband said it was like "breakfast stuffing" and I only used 4 slices of bread instead of 6. I think it needs onions and a little more seasoning.

This was good.  It was a tad too dry though, but I'm sure that can be remedied easily the next time by using a little less bread.

I needed something to bring to our teacher appreciation breakfast. With the 5 star rating my hopes were high. I tested it out on my family to see how we would like it. Unfortunately, there was not a great deal of flavor. I opted for another recipe from this site.

I was really excited about making this recipe due to to all the 5 star ratings.  No question that is was VERY simple to make the night before --I followed directions to the letter and it turned out nicely but my family just didn't care for the taste (sorry)--I will make it again but take other suggestions and add some chiles,onions,etc--I guess as a Texan I think everything has to have some spice in it!!!!!  The taste was not bad but just a little on the bland side for my family's tastebuds!! Thanks for a very easy to prepare recipe!!!

I have used this recipe several times now.  It is now expected Christmas morning and I recently served it up for a family brunch at my home.  I doubled the recipe and it was gone!  The only change I make is that I use two tubes of Jimmy Dean reduced fat pork/turkey sausage.  I don't think anyone could tell the difference and I also don't use as much cheese as the recipe calls for.  Love it!!!!

it's good but i can't see why we should put that much effort preparing them overnight when we can just easily grill them and have them equally delicious.

We wanted to make this a little healthier so we made a few changes.  We used the 8 egg equivalent of Egg Beaters as well as light regular flavored sasauge.  Everything else we followed exactly.  It turned out good and we will make again.

This was easy and tasty. I added crumbled bacon (because I had extra). It was great. Serve with an overnight french toast for the best of both worlds.

Excellent.  I made this twice over the holidays.  The first time I forgot to turn the heat down and it did come out a little thin - but the second time I followed the directions more closely and it was perfect!  I also added a onion and fresh mushrooms - fabulous!

I added an extra egg to this because four just didn't sound like it would be enough for my crowd.  The dish was a hit and all ages loved it.  It may become our Christmas breakfast!

We really weren't impressed at all.  Admittedly, we did not follow the recipe exactly--per other reviews, I added an extra egg and we didn't toast the bread.  Maybe it would have been better if we followed the recipe exactly...In any case, we won't be making this again.

Brought it for church brunch and did not even get a chance to try it myself because it went so fast and everyone is asking for the recipe.  So - I'm assuming it was pretty tasty.  I did make a few changes according to recommendations I viewed - added onion, used maple sausage, more eggs, croutons and sharp cheddar.

Great recipe!  Extremely easy to put together during a very busy weekend with overnight guests and it got rave revues in the morning.  We'll have this again, I'm sure.  Thanks for a very good recipe!

I didn't try this recipe but made it for my boyfriend. I used hot sausage sauted with one chopped small yellow onion and one chopped red bell pepper.I cubed the bread and toasted it in the oven at 400 degrees for 15 minutes. I didn't drain the fat from the sausage and added extra cheese which made the dish greasy. I added eight eggs but I think it would have turned out better with ten or even a dozen eggs. My boyfriend liked the dish overall. It may have been my error with the fat from the meat that caused the dish to be so greasy.  Next time I would drain the fat, add more eggs and use toasted french or sourdough bread.

Easy and delicious.  We made it with a dozen eggs, but 8 might be enough.  When the mixture sits overnight, it absorbs all of the liquid.  We started with six eggs, but didn't want to leave it to chance and added six more eggs.  Also added more cheese on top at end of cooking.  I would definately make for family gatherings and lazy weekends.  There seem to be many versions that you can pick your favorite ingredients to suit your tastes.

I too am a little late in getting this in.  I did make it for Christmas morning and since my family loved it so much, I try to make it at least once a month.  I did use 8 eggs rather than 6 and I used at least 2 cups of cheese,  (I know - I know).  Thanks for this recipe and I plan on serving it for many more years to come!

I took this to a teachers appreciation breakfast with great reviews. I did make several changes as suggested by others. I used regular rather than mild Jimmy Dean. I sauteed red bell pepper and yellow onion with the sausage. Rather than salt I used Cavender's Greek Seasoning, (6) eggs, can of mushrooms drained & tops of green onions. I added 1/2 of the cheese(sharp cheddar) into the mixture and the other 1/2 on top the last few minutes of cooking. I also substituted 2 slices worth of bread with seasoned bread crumbs. Next time I'll use 1/2 & 1/2. I also used a smaller pan to give it thickness which increased the cooking time to 60-65 minutes without reducing the temp. Delicious!!

This is very yummy stuff! I toss in a chopped bunch of green onions as well, but other than that I follow the recipe exactly. This doesn't have to wait for Christmas - this is a great weekend treat, especially on a lazy Sunday!

I love this recipe. It is so easy to make and it tastes so good. I have used sliced American cheese in place of cheddar when I am out of it and it tastes just as good. Even my picky children like this. I need to make this again soon!

Loved this, made it for Christmas brunch.  I used 1 3/4 cups 1% milk, 8 eggs and added some green onion.  My guests preferred this over the other egg dish I served. I put it together the night before and baked in the morning.

Best breakfast casserole ever, and I've tried several!  I did brown the hash browns in the oven for about 15 minutes prior to cooking the entire casserole.  Think they might have been soggy otherwise.

I made this dish for breakfast morning it was wonderful! I didn't have a 9x13 so I used a 8x12 and I liked it better as it made the casserole a little thicker. 
Next time I will add one or two more eggs but it also tastes great as is.

This is the third year I've made this and we enjoy it more each year.  I use fresh bread from our local store and cut that up instead of regular "white" bread and this year I ended up using 10 medium eggs so all the bread was covered.  Put it in the fridge, and on Christmas morning popped it in the oven.  My husband has been eating the leftovers all week (it's that good!!).  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent and easy!  I used more eggs though because I wanted it to be an egg dish and not be too bready.  I used 8 eggs and will use even more next time.  I used turkey sausage links cut up and it was soooo good!

Yummy!  I used chopped ham instead of sausage, because I had leftovers that needed to be used.  It was great the way we did it, but I think it would have been a 5 star recipe if I would have followed the directions with sausage.  I think next time I will add a couple more eggs.  Will make again.

Wow! Had the in-laws over yesterday for Christmas brunch and this went over beautifully!  Thank you for an incredibly easy, satisfying meal.  Leftovers this morning were just as good! For folks who wanted a little more flavor, I sauteed a small onion (chopped)and used sweet Italian sausage and scali for the bread.  It was fantastic.  We'll be making this again--on New Years!

A bit greasy, but the taste was pretty good- BUT I must say this recipe gets a zero for presentation... mine came out flat as a pancake, no volume at all, and certainly not attractive enough to serve company. :o( Perhaps I did something wrong????

I made this for a family brunch, YUM!  Even though I overcooked it, it was still great.  I used 8 eggs though.  A keeper!

I don't know why this recipe got so many rave reviews. Different strokes I guess. :-) I did not care for it very much. I used hot sausage because I like spicy food. I am sure I would have only given it one star if I hadn't spiced it up a bit.

Great recipe but be sure to follow previous comments and increase eggs to six and use some spicy/hot sausage for more kick.

I made this for the first time last night and we had it for breakfast this morning.  It was soooo good.  I used spicy sausage which might account for the good flavor.  I used an 8 x 10 glass pan and it worked out well.  I might try adding a couple more eggs next time (as others have suggested), but it was delicious just as is.
Also, I'm going to freeze the leftovers (there are only 2 of us) and reheat in the microwave.

When I made this I used spicy sausage and it was extremely tasty! I had to cut back on the cooking time a bit as it started to burn around the edges about seven or eight minutes before it was supposed to be finished (this could very well be a problem with my oven though, not with the recipe). I loved this and will definitely be making it again! Thanks!! :)

I didn't get to try this recipe as it was gone before I even had a chance.  However, everyone else thought it was quite tasty.  It was also easy to put together, which is great when you have a lot of company and don't want to spend a lot of time in the kitchen!

Don't make the mistake of putting this on the bottom shelf of your oven it will burn.  We ate around the burnt part and found it to be bland.  I'll try a sage sausage or spicy sausage next time.

This is a popular breakfast dish but I thought it was just okay.  I should have pressed out more grease from the sausage as I thought it was too greasy.  I did use 6 eggs and an extra slice of toast which turned out well.  I recommend using a 9 x 13" pan.

Could this be easier and more scrumptious?  Doubt it.  I took this to a MOPS breakfast and it was gone in ten minutes.  I had to give the recipe to everyone in the group.

I have had this Breakfast Casserole every Christmas morning for as long as I can remember! It's PERFECT paired with a fresh gooey cinnamon roll!  You can also add mushrooms or salsa to this recipe for a twist. Try it you will love it! It also heats up very well in the microwave.

This was delicious even with all the reduced fat/calories changes I made.  We try to eat pretty healthy, so I changed the sausage to Morningstar Farms vegetarian sausage, used two whole eggs and three egg whites, used skim milk, and used reduced fat cheese with just a little regular on top.  My whole family loved it, and no one even knew it was a lower fat version (although we normally eat these lowfat foods, etc.).

This was great for popping in the oven before the guests arrived, but I found the taste a bit... bland, even after adding green onions, pepper and sage to the sausage.  I'll make this again, but next time I'll make even more alterations!

Made this and took to work on Christmas Eve--everyone LOVED it.  Many asked for the recipe--I directed them to this site.  I added 3/4 cup of chopped onions after reading the other reviews.  My kids and husband loved it also.  It was even better as leftovers the next morning.  Thanks!

I served this to my picky husband, picky daughter, and her not-so-picky fiancee on Christmas morning.  We all loved it!

I discovered when I was starting to prepare it that I didn't have any dry mustard, but since I was using sharp Cheddar, it had enough zip to it. I also used the 12-ounce package of Jimmy Dean reduced fat sausage (because I don't like thre greasy taste of sausage) and Sara Lee Honey White bread.  Next time, I do think I'll add two more eggs, as several reviewers have suggested. 

This will definitely make a repeat appearance on our breakfast table....very easy and good!

I had high hopes after reading the reviews but I found this dish to be boring. Used the maple sausage as others suggested. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't that good. My husband said it needed mushrooms. I think it just needed more flavor. If you like bread, eggs and sausage and don't care how it's prepared then this is for you.

This was good but a little bland for my taste.  I'll make it again but as others recommended, I'll add some ingredients to perk up the taste.

Excellent! That was the word from all those that tried this on Christmas morning. I used Jimmy Dean Maple flavor sausage.

This recipe is wonderful. My husband and I are HUGE Buckeye fans and we tailgate every game.  We wanted to take something breakfast like for the noon games since we arrive at 7 am.....everyone LOVED it and now they request it weekly.  It's great because I make it up the night before throw it in the oven and place it in a thermal casserole dish and go.  Thanks so much!

Good recipe. I made it for Christmas '01 and everyone loved it. However, I would cut back on the amount of eggs next time

I'm not a big fan of eggs, but this was wonderful!  It even impressed my dad, the ultimate critic.

This was a great treat to wake up to Christmas morning.  I will make it again for family.  It's nice just to place in the oven without spending the morning cooking.

Made this for Christmas Day, everyone loved it.  I thought it would be even better served wrapped in warm tortias with salsa.

This was pretty good (especially if you like the flavor of pork sausage), it goes very well with Christmas breakfast. be sure to bake it long enough, or it will be kind of runny. I think adding a bit of sage would be a good idea, and maybe more cheese. This year I'm going to use Italian sausage. All in all, a good recipe.

I made this dish for my first Christmas Brunch.  The dish was a hit.  Everyone loved it!  The eggs were nice and fluffy.  I made this casserole for over 15 people and no one disliked it!  Thank you, Michi in Miami
