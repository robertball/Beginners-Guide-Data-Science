Hi all! Just wanted to add a note after reading the reviews. This calls for  just 3 chipotle peppers, not 3 cans of chipotle peppers!  Of course, add more or less to taste. ;)

I thought it needed more chili powder but other than that it was great as written. Leftover smoked brisket would be great in this too.

This chili as written would be not eatable for our taste. We only had one can of the chipotle peppers and doubled the other ingredients. We tried to calm the spiciness out of it by adding cheese, tomato soup and stewed tomatoes which made it eatable.

I tried this recipe with one can and it was hot enough that the parents of small and medium children at our church pot luck were very disturbed with my lack of concern for their children. Other than that this WAS a great Chili.
