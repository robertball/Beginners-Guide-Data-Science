Yummy!  I used Greek-style non-fat yogurt instead of messing around with straining regular yogurt (Greek-style yogurt is already strained).

excellent, i did add a little dill in an attempt to copy a local greek place, and it turned out perfect.  the longer you strain the yogurt the thicker sauce you will get. I had no cheesecloth so i had to improvise with a couple coffee filters taped over a bowl.

Freezing and then thawing the yogurt first makes it much faster to drain; I use a coffee filter over a strainer and it takes maybe an hour to drain--it comes out like thick Greek yogurt (even when I use nonfat yogurt). Also, I use an immersion blender instead of grating the cucumber and just blend it all together.

I made this to accompany my gyros tonight and it was really good.  I omitted the mint and added about a tsp of minced onion.  I also added about a 1/2 tbls. of sugar to cut the tang of the yogurt.  Will make again!

Thanks SO much for this recipe!! I can't believe how authentic it tastes. I couldn't find my cheesecloth anywhere so I took others advice to use three coffee filters and it worked perfectly draining only an hour. I also added garlic salt and onion powder although I'm sure it would be just as good without. I also skipped the cucumber draining and just pressed it between two paper towels, it was perfect! I let it sit in the refrigerator for two hours before dinner and my DH went crazy over this sauce on the turkey gyro recipe from this site!!

I do believe this is the best recipe outside of Athens for Tzatziki, you did not go the route of adding sour cream or (shudder) mayonnaise.  I followed all the steps for proper drainage and the ingredients BUT I added another TBS of lemon juice, I love it's tang and I did add 3TBS of a good olive oil for extra richness and smoothness.  It reminded me of the wonderful Tzatziki I have enjoyed on my many vacations on Crete.  There is nothing like it to accompany kababs hot off a wood fired grill on a starlit night. AAAAAHHH  life is so short and I am so old!

First time I ever tried something like this.  I used 2 coffee filters instead of cheesecloth.  I also used only 2 6oz containers of plain yogurt.  I served it over the Souvlaki(from this site).  It was all very good!

This was AWESOME.  I could have eaten it all by itself.  I also like how the strained yogurt changes consistency.  Really cool.

I thought this was just OK.  Straining the yogurt gave it a better consistency.  But think it had too much mint, not enough garlic and needed dill.

I was looking for a low-calorie alternative to mayo and this worked out great. I also did the coffee-filter thing and only drained an hour, plus omitted parsley and mint and it was still much tastier than the fat-free mayo they sell at the store.

YUM! I found this recipe last minute, so didn't drain the yogurt, nor let it sit for the entire two hours. Still super tasty though! True, it was even better the next day, so I'll try to plan ahead next time.

I wrote this recipe and love all the variations that everyone has tried.  Honestly, have tried all of them myself.  I do like DILL in the recipe and I'm loopy over fresh parsley.  If you like that Middle-Eastern taste try it that way too.  You can also substitute dry herbs if needed.  Some people like the mint others don't- it's just personal preference.   What's funny is when I wrote the recipe ALL RECIPES edited out to substitute coffee filters for cheese cloth.  Everyone figured that out on their own! Cheese cloth is not a standard stock item in my pantry either.  I take two filters in my small tupperware strainer and overlap them.  When rushing I put a weight over the yogurt while it's draining (a can of soup) and it helps speed up the process.  ALSO, as someone else suggested you can squeeze the water out of the cucumbers.  I almost always do that after I peel, scoop out the seed prior to grating.  I do prefer the greek yogurt that comes strained already - it is a HUGE time saver.  If your local market doesn't have it, try a local health food store.    For those that are budget conscious (if the Greek stuff isn't on sale) I use the Plain store brand yogurt and just drain it the night before.  Enjoy!!!

Mmmmm! I had been craving this since I had it at a local diner and it was perfect! Used greek yogurt. Dill instead of mint and extra garlic! Thanks!

Yummy! I have made similar dips before, but they tended to get runny after a little while because of the moisture from the cucumbers. The version has a much nicer consistency because the cucumbers are thoroughly drained. Only problem I have with this recipe is with the measurements - it's not clear how much of the original 16 oz of yogurt is left after draining, and since I was starting with Greek yogurt, I skipped the draining step and had to guesstimate how much to use. It came out great though - my guess is that the exact proportions are kind of a matter of taste.

This recipe made a thick, creamy tzatziki. I used lemon zest to keep it thick, rather than the juice, and I would add more garlic next time.

REALLY GOOD!!! However, I substituted  the parsley & mint with Dill. I also used Greek yogurt, as you do not have to strain it :-)

Here's another vote for Greek style yogurt! Drained it in a coffee filter for @ an hour anyway. Doubled the garlic, too. Used coarsest side of box grater for cuke. Was wonderful, I put this on shredded leftover lamb shank from elsewhere on this site!

My kids love this so much they would rate it higher than 5 stars. This is way better than anything you could get pre-made. We chopped the cucumber, no need to grate. Delicious.

I love this sauce!!! I had it at a local restaurant and had to learn to make it.  Use the Greek yogurt and you won't have all the extra steps with straining it.  Great!

This was a very yummy sauce!  I, too, used non-fat Greek yogurt and it gave it a nice, thick consistency without draining.  I doubled this recipe because I was using two large English cucumbers and watch out, it makes a ton.  I also used minced garlic and lemon juice and added some more for extra flavor, but left out the mint and the parsley because I wanted to use dill instead.  Overall, very refreshing and great on grilled chicken and rice!

Good enough to eat by itself or with fresh pita.  Absolutely amazing.  Be sure to use the right yogurt and drain it correctly.

I thought the flavor was pretty nice in this recipe. I took other review's advice and drained the yogurt as MUCH as possible... and turned out it was too thick! I think I will have to guage this better. I think I would also try to sweeten it up a little next time.. Not sure what to use though! I used the Greek Yogurt and it seemed too tart for my taste.

It definitely has a sour bite to it.  I took a recommendation from below and added half a teaspoon of sugar to it.  I didn't use the mint, salt or pepper.  I think the big difference between this and what I've tasted in commercial restaurants is that there might be based with ranch dressing and this is the real thing.  For all those stating they don't like the overnight wait, I did my yogurt in the morning and waited 6 hours.  I also used paper towels for everything and it turned out fine.  Now I'm just waiting on the 2 hour chill time.  So I started this at 11:30 this morning and I should be able to eat by 7pm.

Exactly like the sauce from a restaurant!  I added a little bit of honey to cut through the tang of the yogurt.

Didn't strain yogurt over night but drained water out of it. Also, just squeezed water out of cucumber but this was great!

This tzatziki sauce recipe was very simple, but I made a few adaptations to it. I used flour sack towels with paper towels on the outside to drain the cucumber and doubled the amount of parsely for color. I served this on top of grilled chicken pitas and with pitas chips. My 3yo says she likes it better than McDonalds, which quite an accomplishment.

Great Recipe!   I left out the mint (personal preference) and added dill, used Greek yogurt to speed up the process (didn't have to drain anything), and squeezed my shredded cucumber in between towels to get rid of excess water - hadn't allowed myself enough time to do the draining part.  However, the tzaziki was great and everyone at the dinner party loved it!   Will definitely continue to use this recipe.

I have always added a bit of natural sweetner to my Tzatziki sauce.  I find it way too sour without it.  I now add a bit of stevia to taste.   My husband (who doesn't care for sweets) even likes it better as did my potluck group.

I've made this twice now... first time I added dill on the advice of other reviewers... Second time I omited it.  I found this recipe was missing something, on the advice from a greek friend I used half yogurt and half sour cream and strained it all.... Much Much Much better!!  Tastes almost Authentic.  Great we loved it!  4 stars only cause its missing the sour cream other wise perfect!

Good. Per another reviewer, added a little sugar to decrease the tanginess of the yogurt.

This was my first cucumber sauce and it went really well with my steak gyros.  I did change a few details... I added more green pepper, 1 more clove of garlic, skipped the lemon zest, and added some Cavenders Greek seasoning to taste.  I also had some bruchetta( diced tomatoes, white onion, and fresh basil) so I threw that in the mix, which really complimented the cucumber taste.  It was pretty authentic tasting and my husband was realy impressed, thanks for the simple recipe:)

Exactly the Tzatziki Sauce flavor I was looking for!  I added some dried dill, probably a little to much.  Next time I will try without dill.  Used as a salad dressing and side sauce for some pork chops I made marinated with the Souvlaki recipe from this site. DELICIOUS!

This was really good. I doubled the recipe because after the yogurt drains, it's almost half the original volume and people LOVE to pile this stuff on their pitas and sandwiches or use it as a dip. I was feeling a bit lazy the day I made this and used baby seedless cucumbers and didn't peel them: the baby cukes have a tender skin and I kinda liked the green color it adds so I'll probably do it that way in the future.

I grew up as an Air Force dependent on Crete for quite a few years as  a chiks and we never ate in any restaurant without huge plates of fried zucchini, fried potatoes or tsaziki sauce to dip them in! Not to mention huge onion and cucumber salads drizzled with (locally grown!) Olive oil and balsamic vinegar( 2 to 1 ratio) ..topped with huge cubes of feta cheese and luscious fresh bread...I, too, was adopted by my own Yia Yia, ( our landlady, a widow always dressed in head to toe black clothing) and she fed me fried potatoes and tsaziki until I thought I'd pop!This is the closest, most delicious recipe I've found, Thanks JessNeo!

Tastes GREAT! I did use Greek-style yogurt, because I didn't want to mess with straining and draining. It turned out awesome. The only thing I added was a bit of finely chopped dill,and it turned out excellent. Also, because I used really thick Greek yogurt, I didn't even make a big deal out of straining the cucumber. I did pat it down a bit after I grated it, and used a hothouse(English cucumber), so maybe that made a difference. If you use real Greek yogurt, you can't really go wrong. Just add ingredients to your taste. You'll be glad you did! Tastes fresh and better than most restaurants!

Delicious! I did change it up a bit. I used plain Greek yogurt (didn't strain it), added another garlic clove, added way more lemon juice, and used dill instead of all the mint. I did add a tiny bit of mint.  After letting it sit in the fridge for a few hours, it was so good!!!  I used it to put on some falafel, but I found myself just eating it with a spoon!!  I couldn't stop!!!

I just spent a few weeks living in Greece, and I was so excited to come home and make this for my family. Unfortunately this recipe did not produce the authentic dip that I had multiple times in Thessaloniki. I added a few tablespoons of honey and didn't add any of the mint. I still wasn't completely happy with it. If I make it again, I probably wouldn'f add the parsley in and would add some dill and quite a bit of honey.

Read all the reviews and took advice from a number.  Used No Fat Greek yogurt, chopped the cucumber by hand and added 1/4 c each, dried parsley and dill.  Also added 2 T dried onion, soaked in a little water, 5 crushed cloves and salt-garlic blend to taste.  Added 2 tsp of sugar to win over my 3 young granddaughters as they only like the "mayo junk" dips.  We served it on fish.  The granddaughters loved it!!  Told me, "Grandma, you rock!"  Thanks for the great recipe and thanks for all the great reviews.

Delicious and easy. I used non-fat yogurt because that's what I had on hand. I didn't have the patience to drain the yogurt for more than a couple hours but it still turned out great.

I used nonfat plain yogurt (looked for greek but store didn't have) and did not strain, so understand it would have been better if I had. But to comment on the spices, it is an interesting different sort of taste just to vary up tzatziki, but I think I prefer the dill version.

This is great!  I did have to leave out the dill and mint because I did not have any, and I added about 3 Tbsp. of sour cream.  I would suggest to sqeeze and drain your cucumbers because the first time I made tzatziki (from another recipe), it was watery.  When I found the recipe on this site, I read some of the comments and drained the cucumber.  I did not drain the yogurt because I did not have any cheese cloth.  As soon as everything was mixed together, I immediately dipped in the pita bread and the taste was marvelous.

YUM! It's awesome with warmed pita bread, crackers or veggies as a healthy alternative to ranch dip. Like some of the other reviewers, I added dill, because that's how it was served in Turkey. I LOVE this. Thanks for sharing! :)

You might think I'm crazy, but just try this:  use Yoplait's Pina Colado yogurt in place of plain yogurt.  It makes this recipe taste FANTASTIC

yay, a tzatziki recipe that is similar to how i learned to make it in Athens, over 25 years ago...you can just squeeze the cuke pieces though, to speed up the process. (and using thick yogurt to begin with, like full-fat yogurt,will make it extremely yummy but too high fat..)Also in a pinch garlic powder can be substituted. but go easy!

This was very good and healthy, especially since I used nonfat yogurt.  I was more heavy-handed with the mint, added oregano and paprika, and omitted the cucumber.  I served this with ground turkey (flavored with garlic, salt, pepper, thyme, and chili flakes) and naan.  Quick, easy, and good for you.

Excellent!!! I would use a touch more grated cucumber.  Also, I used the fattiest yogurt available to give it that extra creaminess.

Great tzatziki, everyone loved it. Draining the yogurt first gives it a much better texture and easier to use as a dip. Thanks!

Yum! This was fabulous. I added a small container of sour cream to thicken it, as I did not have a day to wait. Added a few extra calories, but it was SUPER creamy and delicious.

I cut this recipe in half because I thought 16 oz. would be too much sauce for two. Big mistake! This sauce was so delish on our falafel burgers my husband and I were fighting over it. I used a microplane to grate the cucumber and garlic so the sauce still had a smooth, creamy texture. It's so easy and probably tastes even better the next day (if you have any left!) Would be great also as a dip for veggies or pita chips.

This dip is amazing!!! My family makes a cucumber and cream cheese dip that is great for ruffles chips - but this is so much healthier and it tastes delicious! I used garlic salt instead of regular salt though. Fantastic!

Fantastic accompaniment to grilled herb chicken. Greek yogurt is definitely the better option instead of draining, if you have it. Added just a teaspoon of dill to round out the herbiness. My partner and I love this recipe!

This was delicious and reminded me of the tzatziki sauce I get from street vendors. Rather than store-bought, I used homemade yogurt made from whole milk. I usually strain my homemade yogurt a little before serving it just using a strainer. For this recipe, I tried straining it for a couple hours using coffee filters. I'm not sure if that made a difference.  In any event, the sauce came out smooth, creamy and delicious. Don't forget to season with salt and pepper!

This was excellent.  I have made this recipe several different ways.  My favorite is to use Icelandic Skyr, triple the mint and parsley, double the cucumber, add a little lemon zest, and use a food processor.

This is heavenly! I added 1 teaspoon of dill weed and used low fat Greek yogurt. I sometimes also add a couple shakes of Frank's Red Hot sauce, which gives the tzatziki a nice kick:)

Joined Weight Watchers so constantly on the look out for a low point recipe.  This totally met my GREEK side!  I took the advice of other reviewers and used Greek Non-fat yogurt (so no need to strain) and added the dill weed, pinch of sugar and onion powder and was ABSOLUTELY thrilled with this dip!!

Took more time than I was looking for, but I'd have to say it's worth it. I put it a top gyro meat and red onions and pita bread and had my family begging for me to make more.

I personally prefer versions with some sour cream and I'm not sure I loved the mint in this. I normally don't have any, and use recipes that call for oregano instead. Mint is traditional but since I'm not Greek I really don't feel any shame in saying I don't think I care for it in the sauce, just in the meat that I put this sauce on. It did come out reasonably thick, which is nice. Thanks for sharing!

REALLY nice.  The overnight straining was easy to do and I was astonished how much water came out.  The end result is thick, tasty, and refreshing.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I added fresh dill to this recipe, because I remember that flavor in tzatziki.  I used a coffee filter on top of paper towels over a colander in a bowl, and I think I got about a cup of liquid from the yogurt.  I like the freshness of the herbs, and I can't wait to use it for sammies in pita bread tonight.  Thanks for the recipe.

We used greek yogurt. I do believe the different yogurts make this taste different. It came out a tad tart. I have had greek yogurt that isn't, and some that are. I added dill, I do believe it is a must. To counter the tart of the yogurt I added pinches of sugar until it had a good flavor. I really like this, my mom was so-so about it. She states to her, it tastes like something is still missing.

I halved the recipe for just the two of us and wished I hadn't - I would have used it for a dip for pita chips. I didn't have the mint so used dill, still delish!

Perfect!  I used greek yogurt, as suggested by another reviewer, and it was absolute perfection.  Exactly what I wanted.  I only let the cucumber drain about 30 minutes and it was fine.  I let the flavors marry for two days.

Very enjoyable.  I used greek yogurt and fell in love with it.  Next time I will use more garlic and dill as was suggested by others.

I enjoyed the flavour of this recipe, however, I will be looking for "thicker" tzatziki sauce recipe.

This was really good.  My husband loves this sauce and was surprised when I made it and it came out better then the sauce at a few local restaurants.  I did not have mint on hand but it i will try it next time with it just to see which we like better.  It was not missed though.  I served this on pita bread with shredded lettuce and souvlaki (from this site).

It was OK, but the mint overpowered the tang of the sauce.  I'd cut that in half and use more sour cream instead.
