I love this bread, but always run out of people to give the starter too.  This last time I froze them.  I took one out and just let it sit for the 10 days, not adding the extra 3 cups on the 5th or 10th day, I just stirred it each day.  Then on the 10th day I followed the rest of the recipe and the bread turned out wonderful, no difference and I don't have to find 3 people to give a starter too.  Thought this might help anyone trying to find a friend to share with or if your friends all say no.

If you read up on sourdoughs and starters, you'll find that one of the reasons people mess with them is the health benefit of the natural occuring yeasts.  Unfortunately, most people these days have become too "domesticated", and so can't see how letting something go sour on its own can be any good.  Thus, most "official" starter recipes call for addition of store bought yeast.  In the authentic way, you start with one cup each of flour, milk and sugar, stir it every day for the first 4 days, add one cup each of flour, milk and sugar on day 5, stir well; stir it every day for the next 4 days; add one cup each of flour, milk and sugar on day 10, stir well - and you should be ready to use the starter.  Traditional recipes ask to only use wooden or plastic bowls/jars/utensils.  This is done because there is a possibility of the yeast's acidity acting on the metal and changing PH and messing everything up.  The other important point to make, is that when you're making the starter, it should be left uncovered or covered loosely with cheese cloth or such.  The starter needs airflow!  Once ready, the starter could be kept in the fridge for about 2 weeks; to reactivate it, take it out and feed it with one cup each of flour, milk and sugar, stir well and leave at room temperature.  I think that starter can be covered with a lid/kept in a zip-lock bag while refridgerated.  For those who want to have their starter always available - keep it at room temperature, stir it every day, and fe

I'm just curious what happens if you forget to add the ingredients on the specified day or does the batter go bad if you don't bake the batter in 10 days.

THIS IS THE RECIPE/NOTES THAT I GOT WITH THE BREAD THAT WAS PASSED TO ME AND IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT SO I'M CURIOUS HOW MUCH IT MATTERS???
Please note the following:
Do not use any type of metal spoon or bowl.
Do not refrigerate.
If air gets into the bag, let it out.
It is normal for the batter to rise and ferment.

 Day 1: Do nothing, this is the day you receive the batter. The bag is dated.
 Day 2: Mash the bag
 Day 3: Mash the bag
 Day 4: Mash the bag
 Day 5: Mash the bag
 Day 6: Add to the bag :1 C. flour  1 C. sugar and 1 C. cold milk.  Mash the bag.
 Day 7: Mash the bag
 Day 8: Mash the bag
 Day 9: Mash the bag
 Day 10: Follow the directions below:
 
 1. Pour the entire contents of the bag into a Non Metal Bowl.
 2. Add 1 1/2 C. flour, 1 1/2 C. of sugar, 1 1/2 C. of milk
 3. Measure out 4 separate batters (1 cup each) into 4 Ziplock (1 gallon bags). 
 Keep a starter bag for yourself and give 3 to friends with a copy of the recipe.
 Note: If you keep a starter for yourself you will be baking every 10 days.

Baking Instructions:
 1. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
 2. To the remaining batter in the bowl add:
  
 3 eggs
 1 cup of oil
 1/2 cup of milk
 1 cup of sugar
 2 tsp. of cinnamon
 1/2 tsp. of vanilla
 1 1/2 tsp. of baking powder
 1/2 tsp. of baking soda
 1/2 tsp. of salt
 2 cups of flour
 2 small boxes of pudding
 (optional) 1 cup of chopped nuts, raisins, dried fruit or chocolate chips

 3. Grease 2 large loaf pans(may need 3 medium sized loaf pans)
 4. Mix into separ

I use to keep my starter in plastic bags but read somewhere that the starter needs AIR to grow...makes sense.  So I picked up a couple of glass jars (8cups) with glass lids (that have the removable plastic thingy on them to keep it air tight)...well I took OFF the plastic thingy to allow are IN.  The Starter is on Day 6 and is growing and bubbly like I have NEVER had it before...must be the little bit of air.  My instructions say DO NOT USE METAL to stir...I use the handle part (with a hole in it) from a plastic ladle...you can use anything when you're baking on day 10.  I also keep 1 cup for my next starter batch and cook a DOUBLE recipe of the same cakes using about 2 cups of starter for each recipe.  Works out great! This is a great beginner/experimenting/use what you have on the shelf kinda recipe.  Wrap extra cakes (LOL if there's any left) in waxed paper, then in foil, then place in plastic bags in the freezer...they last for months!  In all the years I've made it...I've never had any complaints.

Sounds great but I need some answers before getting started .... if after 10 days you are going to start over with 1 cup of the starter (stir day 2-4, add ingredients day 5 etc) do you leave this 1 cup of starter at room temperature or follow the steps and leave it in the refrigerator? And how long will the starter store in the refrigerator before you need to stir it, use it or freeze it? As a newbie sourdough maker I thank you for any advice.

I made some Amish Friendship bread when I was 13 years old and I loved it. I was very happy to find a started recipe and now I have a question. I added the sugar, flour, and milk on the 6th day and my bag is no longer making bubbles. Did I do something wrong or is this normal. Before I added it the bag was fermenting and making bubbles and now it has stopped. I would appreciate any help. Thank You

Does anyone know why it says that?  By the way my bread came out delicious!!  I also remember my mom making this bread.  It is so easy, but it is just a pain having a plastic bad constantly sitting around.  If I don't keep it out I will forget about it!

I love making this bread and giving it as gifts. The only problem is, I worked and baking during the week was a problem for me; also, no one wants the excess starter. I have solved these problems. I set my routine up on an 8-day cycle rather than a 10 day cycle and cut the feeding volumes down to 1/4 cup. DAY 1: Receive ¼ cup of starter (best if done on saturday or sunday, if you work weekdays) Store starter in a plastic sandwich baggie or quart size baggie.
DAYS 1-3 (Sat-Sun-Mon): squeeze the bag several times (release air, if needed)
DAY 4 (Tue): add ¼ cup each of flour, sugar, milk, squeeze bag to mix ingredients 
DAYS 5-7 (W-Th-F):	squeeze the bag several times (release air, if needed)
DAY 8 (Sat): baking day: pour batter into a large NON-METAL BOWL and add: ¼ cup each of: flour, sugar, milk; mix with a RUBBER SPATULA OR WOODEN SPOON. Pour ¼ cup of batter back into a new plastic bag to keep as your starter.  Bake your bread as directed in recipe.
 This routine allows you to always do the bread baking on the weekend and the reduced amounts of feeding guarantees No excess starter to worry about forcing on friends! Works like a charm.

NEED HELP!!
Day 6 I open my bag to let out the air and a vinegar smell comes out of the bag. Did something go wrong? Now that I look back at it my water may have been more than 110 as I did not test it. I added the extras today, in hopes that I can keep moving forward on this. Maybe I need to throw away and do-over in a plastic bowl with a loose lid to let air in?!?! PLEASE HELP!!!

This bread is really good, but let's face it, at some point, you will run out of friends to give starters to. Here is a way to keep the cuture going for yourself without throwing any extra away: 1. begin with 1/3 cup of starter 2. add 1/3 cup milk, sugar, flower on day 5 and 10 (you will end up with 1.5 cups) 3. take one cup to make your bread, take 1/3 cup to start over again  Everything else is the same. Actually you can scale the additions up too--all you are doing is expanding up the yeast, by giving it more sugar on day 5 and 10. there is no need to go so big if you don't need to give any away.   (BTW, I work in a lab and grow all kinds of cells, including yeast. So I looked at this protocol just as I would in the lab!)

If you follow as directed and leave out the last 1c flour,1c sugar,1c milk usually added prior to dividing into 4 sections then you will have enough starter for what you are cooking and only 1 additional.I divide this starter in half and freeze the other half until I am ready to bake again. That way I am always replacing the 1 starter from the freezer that I am using and not creating more. Also I used powdered milk instead of reg. milk and that went bad if not cooked immediately. So I took a starter from the freezer and let it thaw then added what you would add on day 5 let sit over night and finished the next day. Bread was perfect so having it sit out for days is not necessary as long as the starter had a chance to start the furmentation process. Using these techniques has stopped my fattening chain letter that never goes away and made it manageable when you run out of friends willing to take it.

i love this recipe, and know you can freeze the starter.  my question is, can you just go ahead and bake using the starter as soon as it's thawed or do you have to go through the whole 10 day process again, and the day that it's thawed is day 1?

I've been looking for something like this for a while. While living at home, my mom received the starter from someone she worked with and I used it all the time, keeping a starter on hand. My bread machine yeast worked great, and now I have 4 cups sitting in my freezer! My friends at work loved the basic bread I made and took a starter - and no one had ever heard of it!

To JBLAWAT: when you give the starter away, it should theoretically be day 1, if that was your day 10. Example: I completed my day 10 (added my milk, sugar and flour and stirred), separated the individual 1-cup servings, reserved one 1-cup serving for myself and made my bread with it. I gave away my extra 1-cup servings and copies of the instructions. Since I have already stirred, I have actually completed day 1 for them. If no one is interested in "growing" their starter, they could actually take it home and just bake the bread.

Here are the instructions I pass along to friends who have trouble finding people to give starter to. This allows you to bake 4 loaves of bread each time, keep a starter for later, and either give away a starter or put one in the freezer. I give my neighbors loaves of baked bread and/or freeze the loaves, they are good thawed and eaten as well. (Also includes some tips on Amish bread baking)  Amish Friendship Bread (Double) *Double allows you to have no bags of starter to give to friends, but freeze one bag each time. * Double also allows you to bake 4 loaves of bread, freezable after baking to pull from your freezer later.  Do not use any type of metal spoons or bowls for the mixtures Do not refrigerate (during the 10 days) If air gets into the bag, let it out.  It is normal for it to rise, bubble and ferment.  	Day 1		Do Nothing	(This is the day the mixture was put in the bag) 	Day 2		Mush Bag 	Day 3		Mush Bag 	Day 4		Mush Bag 	Day 5		Mush Bag 	Day 6		Add to bag: 1 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 cup milk and mush bag. 	Day 7		Mush Bag 	Day 8		Mush Bag 	Day 9		Mush Bag 	Day 10	Follow directions below.  1)	Pour batter into a large, non-metal bowl. 2)	Add 1 ½ cup flour, 1 ½ cup sugar, 1 ½ cup milk and mix well with a wooden spoon. (this makes a total of 6 cups batter) 3)	Get 2 gallon size ziplock baggies and label 		Day 1- (put today's date)      		Day 6- (put date in 5 days from today)     		Day 10- (put date 9 days from today) 4)	Measure out 2 separate batters of 1 cup each into

I rate this a 5 star because everyone I have talked to before I found allrecipes, told me that the only way to get a starter was from someone who already had it.  Now I don't have to search.  What do I do, though, if my batter seems to loose its yeast affect?  Do I now have to through away the four starters and start all over?

I baked mine on the 11th day by  accident.  the bread smelled wonderful while it was baking but once it was done, it had a rancid chemical smell coming from the core and well, tasted awful, too, so make sure you follow the recipe carefully.

To those new to the recipe--when ready to cook, you can add just about anything. Any fruit,nuts,applesauce,chocolate chips,peanut butter,pudding mixes work great. You always get something different, yet delicious. My family likes it best when I add any kind of canned pie filling. It's always moist and tastes great heated up with butter on it. It makes a great coffee cake,dessert or snack. Enjoy!!

If you freeze a starter, it cannot be used to make more starters after it's unthawed.  It can only be used to make the bread.  (after unthawing, start at the step in your amish bread recipe where you start adding the ingredients for the bread - the step after separating out the new starters)

i make this bread a lot.i ran out of people to give it to .so i froze three starters in bags.left one out for myself.i skip everything go srtaight to main batter at day ten,do mush the bag and let the air out.i also use my hand mixer and metal pan ,i use only applesauce no oil.i even made the bread after two days in beeing in the bag and it came out the same.the amish didnt have metal or electric mixers this was in the olden days thats why it says not to use metal or your mixer.my bread allways turns out fine and when i come to my last one out of the freezer.i do the whole process ,and then i freeze my three bags again.i even make bigger loaves and cup cakes ,i add what my kiddos like .i also freeze the bread in parchment paper and foil.it allways tastes fresh.

The chain letter of baked-goods.  The end result is yummy, but it's a pain to get it there.  Living in a small town, you run out of people to give it to. Is there a quicker way of getting the bread without having to annoy any more families?

I love this bread. Had forgotten about it, but am so glad I found it again. Juliamom42, I also ran out of people to pass it on to, so when adding ingredients, instead of adding 1 cup of each I only added 1/3 cup of each ingredient and this worked perfectly just for my family. Hope this helps!

I've enjoyed this bread throughout the years.  I saw a few questions on the reviews for this recipe.  I'm not an expert, so take or leave my advice.  I've been feeding my amish bread for a couple of cycles recently, and it seems normal for the fermentation process to slow down when you "feed" the batter on day 6.  The starter is also very forgiving.  A few days here or there for feeding or baking doesn't make a difference.

It's great to find this recipe here : ). I was just given some starter, but the instructions are a bit different so I have some ?s.  ?1) Is it better to use gallon bags, or plastic/glass bowls?;  ?2) it says "if any air gets in the bag, let it out" I thought this batter was supposed to get air via an open ziploc or an open bowl.  Which is it??;    ?3) On Day 10 mine  says to add 1 1/2  cups each of flour, sugar and milk, but that is 1/2 cup more of each ingredient compared to the recipe given here.  Does this matter??;  and ?4) The instructions I received say to bake at 325 not the 350 I see in the friendship bread recipes I see on this site.  What have you experienced???  Thanks

What happens when you leave the starter languishing on the countertop for, say, 20 days?  Okay, other than giving the bag the occasional mash, I was neglectful of duty.  (End of school year rush, but that’s another story.)  After observing few bubbles but no green/pink floaties on Day 16, I added the milk, sugar & flour.  Some (very) mild bubbly activity thereafter, but again, on Day 20, the starter had no green/pink floaties and had passed the odor test.  So I proceeded w/ baking.  Bread turned out surprisingly delicious  (based on family taste tests) though there was, expectantly, not a huge rise.  I then softened a package of yeast in ¼ cup warm water, and split this mixture among three bags of baby starter that had been set aside from the original.  Happy to report that all babies are alive and bubbling well on Day 2.

For safety reasons (the milk), I let this ferment at room temp for 24 hours and then refrigerated it for the remainder of the 10 days.  Also, once you have the starter going, you shouldn't need to follow the 10 days every time.  Just replenish as needed as you use it (like sourdough starter).  I let it sit at room temp for an hour or so before refrigerating again.  Give a friend a cup, tell them to double it the next day, and they're off and running.

Great option if you have no one to give the starters to: usually you make 4 1c. starters which leaves you with 1c. in the bowl to make bread. Instead, take out only 1c. to make a starter for yourself to continue, which leaves 4 cups in the bowl.  Separate 2c. into another mixing bowl, and make 2 separate DOUBLE batches of bread (double whatever Amish bread recipe you are using for EACH bowl).  You can bake a ton of loaves at once and freeze them to use or give away later.  This is a great option when baking these to give as Christmas gifts!
In answer to some previous questions, sometimes the starter seems to die down days 6-9 -this is normal and the bread will bake fine Day 10.  The next started will pick up again bubbling after Day 2...if it doesn't you can always allow more air (leave bag open if you are using a ziplock to let it start fermenting again).

I received a gallon ziplock bag of this (or a nearly identical) starter.  Day 10 fell on Christmas, so I baked the bread Christmas afternoon.  Wonderful!  I've given everyone interested the starter, and now have 2 humongous blobs of starter sitting on the counter...one in a ziplock bag & one in a plastic container.  Today is day 10, and had I not read the timely & most welcome advice on how to refrigerate/freeze extra starter and how to keep it from multiplying too fast by not adding the flour + sugar + milk midway through and on Day 10, I would have dumped my poor starter into the garbage!  My "Baby Blobs" thank you!

I made this starter and used the amish friendship bread recipe without pudding on this web site.  It was absolutely THE most INCREDIBLE bread I have ever tasted!
The easiest way to make the starter would be in a large zip lock bag.  Do not refrigerate the starter while in it's "cycle."  After I made my first loaf, I threw the rest in the fridge.  I took out another cup-- without starting the process over-- and successfully made more bread, however, I think you are actually supposed to start the 10 day cycle over before using it again :)

I use a variety of pudding flavors. With banana cream, I add walnuts. Pistatio is great and I add almonds and it's very Christmasy. Chocolate pudding and chocolate chips, coconut cream, butterscotch are also good! Even adding more cinnamon and some raisins makes a great breakfast bread. Be creative! this is a great recipe that my family loves! I haven't found anything that doesn't work!

I gave it 5 stars because I love Amish Friendship Bread, but I have a question.  I have a son who can't have milk, so I made a starter with soy milk instead.  I saw where people had made the bread with soy milk and it turned out fine, but no one has mentioned making the starter out of it.  The problem is that it keeps separating in the bag.  Should I throw it out and start over or is it still good?  Thanks!

Me and my mom make this bread all the time. With children and homework, it is hard to do the things on the days the recipe calls for. We have been a day or two late with adding everything. There is nothing wrong with it. I would just add the ingredients as soon as you remember.

Thanks for the starter recipe!  Had made this years ago and someone just gave me one that I just whipped up, but my hubby accidentally took them all to work to give away.  Also, I wasn't sure how to extend this past the 10-day marker and we were gearing up to go on vacation.  Now I can make it any time!  I've used all different flavors of instant pudding in our recipes - ranging from chocolate, banana (our fav), vanilla, butterscotch, etc.  You're only limited by your imagination!

I freeze the starter in one-cup servings all the time. I've been doing it this way for 15 years or longer. When I am ready to use it, I place the frozen one-cup of starter in the refrigerator over night OR microwave it on 50% power to thaw. Then I either make a bread with it right away OR I put it into a plastic bowl on my counter and it bubbles and "cooks" on the countertop just fine. Make sure you only use a wooden spoon to mix.  I also only stir mine on day 3 and day 8. I cover the bowl with plastic wrap with just a small breathing hole. Only use plastic or wood utensils.  NO METAL. Not sure why.

I've known this recipe for a long time now, and it's easy to deal with if you use quart sized zip-lock bags for growing and sharing starter, simply change "stir" to "squeeze", and burp the bag as needed. What I wonder is if this starter can be used to make a regular bread, not just a quick bread.

Thank you so much for this recipe.  When My Husband saw the ziplock bag on the counter he looked at me and said not again!!!  He told me you never know who had this stuff in their kitchen and what kind of conditions it had been in.  Well with this there is no worry.  After I started making the muffins I showed him that the whole recipe came from here.  He did not say anything to that (which means really good!).  Thanks for the great and useful recipe.  Will be using this for years to come.  Oh and by the way when my son put an older starter not this one, into the refrigerater it did not want to start back up.  It had been in over night and I kept it out for 7 days and it never got bubbly.  I assumed that it killed the yeast or active ingredients.  Also metal spoons will cause it to do the same.  Not from me personally but a friend had this happen to hers.

I got a starter from a friend and have kept it up for the last couple of months.  All of my neighbors love it! I just gave one of my neighbors the recipe for the starter but I also found the original recipe that doesn't call for yeast, it makes its own. To do it this way, you'll need 1cup sugar, 1cup flour and 1cup milk.  Mix in a plastic or glass bowl. Cover lightly, stir every day and then follow the usual directions. It works wonderfully!

Messy but handy! I love the breads that I made using this starter. Very convenient and easy to maintain. Thanks for the recipe! I use 1/4 cup of milk, sugar, and flour if I plan on making 1 bread for myself and keeping the rest as starter. Otherwise, I use 1 cup of milk, sugar, and flour so I can make 2 batch of bread.

I have been making Amish Friendship bread for many years and find it much easier to give away baked bread!  
Instead of adding a cup, a cup, & a cup, I add one third cup of everything all the time.  Then when it is time to bake I keep (about)one cup of starter and put all the rest into the recipe.  If you try it, let me know what you think.
Also, I don't worry too much if I am off a day on the count unless I would always be off the same way - always too few or always too many days.

This bread is just a staple at our home.

I got a starter from my niece a few years back and we loved it!  And so did everyone I gave the baked bread to.  I just recently heard that you can freeze your starter in plastic ware or bags and the day after it thaws out, count that as your day 1.  Think I'll try that this time.  If you eat one piece of this bread you are guaranteed to want more.

The bread from my original starter turned out wonderful.  Everyone commented how good it was.  I tried freezing the starter and it did not bubble and have air in the bag while laying out for 10 days.  I did not try bread with it so I don't if the starter is good or not.

Perhaps I'm missing something.  The recipe looks like a basic quickbread; there is no kneading or rise time, so why the need for yeast?  The baking powder and baking soda will provide all the leavening, and continue working long after the yeast have expired in the oven.  I can see the starter adding some sourness from the acid produced during fermentation, but you can get this from other means, such as sour cream, buttermilk, even apple cider.

Anyway, I received the starter from a friend, fed it properly, it was bubbly and happy and sour+sweet tasting.  The baked bread tasted perfectly good, but no hint of the starter in there, and no different from other quick breads I've made.  Just a good spice bread.  Which would have gotten 4 stars if not for the trouble of keeping the useless starter around.

As olga mentions elsewhere in the reviews, a real sourdough starter is much more fun to keep and use.

I have been making this bread for years and it is wonderful.  My family loves it so much I try to keep the starter going as long as I can. I use it to make pancakes, waffles, biscuits, rolls, cinnamon rolls, cookies...the list goes on. I have found that with a little creativity and paceints you can make just about anything. I also got tired of the gallon sized bag on my counter so I invested in a pretty glass crock. For those of you having problems with bubbles...it might not be warm enough on your counter so try puting it in the oven overnight (my oven is always a little warm inside) ~JUST DON'T TURN IT ON!~ this will keep it free from drafts and the little bit of heat will help it ferment. Just don't forget to take it out in the morning. Happy baking!!!

I'm gluten intolerant (can't have wheat). I started my own rice flour starter and then usued my G-free flour mix for the bread! It was fun! My friends who aren't gluten intolerent used regular flour in their starter mix and it worked out fine!

I baked mine on day 11, as I didn't have the time or recipe till day 11. It was wonderful. I used the pudding recipe W/ butterscotch pudding and everybody loved it. I, too am glad to find this starter recipe. I fondly remember my mother cooking this and pampering her "Herman" about 20 yrs ago. When I add dry ingredients, I use a nylon or plastic potato masher to smoosh it better, as I don't have a whisk that is non-metal. It works great. Josie, I think your doing it okay, or did it just not go anywhere after that addition? I would not be too concerned about the milk for safety reasons, sour cream and creme' fraise and sourdough starters all start this way. The culture is actually very healthy for you.

This starter is amazing, and I love to use starters made the old fashioned way, but I have found an even easier way to achieve the results without having to have a starter at all, for those who posted about this.  One day, I realized that I had allowed my culture to die and thought I'd have to throw it out, but then thought to substitute buttermilk for the milk in the recipe.  I make my own buttermilk, but I'm sure any with live cultures would work.  I kept the rest of the recipe the same and the bread is very close to the original.  So, for this method, mix 3/4 cup each of flour, sugar, and milk, and then continue with the recipe, substituting buttermilk for the milk in the remainder of the recipe.  I do a double batch each time, so if you only want 2 loaves instead of 4, you need to make the base with about a 1/3 of a cup for each ingredient.  I hope this helps those who don't like to keep starters on the counter. :)

your yeast may have lost its effect if your water temp in the very beginning was over 110 degrees. the hotter the water, the less effective the yeast will be. you don't necessarily have to throw it away, it just won't rise as much. 

what other types of breads can this starter be used for? any suggestions?

I made the Friendship Bread Starter as written, except for regular milk, I used acidophilus milk and another using Lactaid they both turned out perfect. A good tip to remember when dissolving active dry yeast, never stir the yeast with a spoon, let it dissolve on it's own without stirring or it will effect the outcome of yeast to liquid ratio.

I've been searching for this recipe for years! Thank you for sharing. I've given this out to my family and co-workers and we've all enjoyed baking the bread. I would suggest mixing the flour and sugar together before you add to the starter or else you'll end up with clumps.

I know this may sound dumb but I cant remember what my mum use to do with the starter. Do you leave it out on the counter for 10 days or do you keep it in the fridge then stir and add as directed. Thanks for the help :)

I was given the starter by a parent at my school.  I have made the bread every 10 days since May!  I am always searching for someone to take the three starters from me.  I have found that if you make two batches of batter for Friendship Bread which makes four loaves of bread (using 1 cup starter each batch) and give a loaf of bread away with the starter and recipe, most people are happy to take it!  That leaves one starter and two loaves of bread to enjoy!  I also use the gallon ziploc method to mash daily and feed the starter.  I put the date for day 6 with instructions to feed it 1 cup each of milk, flour, and sugar.  I also put the date for day 10 with direcitons to feed it with 1 1/2 cups each milk, flour, and sugar as well as make the bread on the bag.  A reminder NOT to refrigerate and mash daily is also helpful. I use  1 small box of sugar free vanilla pudding and use only skim milk when I made my bread.  I have omitted dusting the loaf pans with cinnamon sugar and just use PAM spray to also reduce sugar.  I can't wait to try using whole wheat flour, Splenda, applesauce to make it healthier!  Gotta go!  Two loaves of Friendship Bread ready to take out of the oven!  Enjoy :)

Gina, I'm somewhat new to this but have been doing alot of reading up on how sourdough starters work. If you were given a starter from someone else then wether you use a air tight bag or a loosely covered glass/plastic container would be personal preference. I was given a starter that's been going around for awhile now and have baked two times now and keeping it in a closed plastic bag has been fine. As far as your question about letting the air out, you'll want to get that air out since that's what your baby bread has released and could sufficate it. The instructions that you were given are the ones that I have and followed the first two times. With adding 1 1/2 cups of flour, milk, and sugar I was left with enough for 4 1 cup portions and enough remaining to bake 2 loaves of bread or 1 bundt pan. Since I have no one to give it to I've frozen some of my starters and I'm now working on trying out different measurements that I've read on here to make enough for 2 loaves plus a 1 or 2 cup starter. As far as what temp to bake at I suppose that depends on your oven. If you've noticed that you burn stuff if baked at the temp and time on a recipe then you'll want to try it for less time or a lower temp or vise versa.

This makes the best dessert bread I have ever tasted. From what I know about the starter, it needs to stay at room temperature and loosely covered so air can get to it. Adding the ingredients in the manner described causes the yeast culture to continue to thrive. It you keep the mix in an airtight container, the gases they release will eventually sufficate them. Also, cold will slow them down.

I put the starter in a freezer bag.  Makes it easy to stir, just squeeze the bag.  Just remember to let the air out each day.  It's also a good way to store it in the fridge or freezer.

So easy to make, but it stinks as it ages. I followed the advice of other reviewers here by covering the plastic bowl with a paper towel and using only wooden spoons to stir the recipe once per day. The mixture never stopped bubbling up for me. However, I used self-rising flour (as it was on hand), so I wonder if that made a difference.

Update: I now know it should not smell bad, as a rancid  smell would be bad bacteria taking hold. (I realized this actually from composting.) 

 Many thanks for sharing this recipe, friend! I had been searching for it ever since someone had given me some starter many years ago (with a recipe I had since misplaced).

Not bad!  I got some starter from my SIL, as it made the rounds at my church, and ran out of people to give it to!  I have 2 bags stashed in the freezer.  As a bit of a foodie, I found the bread good, but not the best bread ever.  More of a novelty than anything!  I prefer my regular sourdough starter!  By the way, I find it amusing that the picture here shows the starter in a METAL bowl and a METAL wisk, when you aren't supposed to use metal anything...

I LOVE this recipe.  Sometime I just make extras and freeze them.  when i want to make some bread i take it out of the freezer that morning and my time i am ready to bake, it is thawed out.  I go ahead and act like it is day 10.  Use that starter and make the bread.  sometimes when I take it to work I bake it in a 9 by 13 pan it serves a lot more people.  It doesn't last long where i work.

Thank you for this recipe.  I was baby-tending the starter for my precious niece while she took an emergency trip, and let it die.  I felt so badly!  I called an Amish-Heritage friend and she told me to look here, as she had already faced this problem with another person.  Thank you!  You have saved family good-will!

I was looking online for the starter and finally i will stick to this one. My sister gave me a starter about 4 months ago and I made so much bread because I ran out of friends to give out starters too. So now i have no starter and my family is anxious to eat Amish bread again for months in a row lol.....This is the best starter. Thanks.

I like to try to be health conscious and lower calorie.  I used whole wheat flour, Splenda (generic brand), and fat free milk throughout.  Also, when baking day came I used those things and rather than using the oil, I used applesauce and sugar free/fat free instant vanilla pudding.  Someone may have already said this but I just though I would add!

I didn't add the yeast, just the sugar, milk and flour and it still turned out great!

I love making this bread, and I'm out of starter, so I'm delighted to see the makings of it.  One variation we love is instead of adding raisins - I add 1 cup canned pumpkin (not the pie filling), a few dashes of allspice and cinnamon, and toss chocolate chips with a little flour and fold them in - and it's delicious - a real keeper!

I have just started baking with mine and am so pleased. I've made some cinnamon bread and have sourdough rising in the kitchen now. The only sad thing is I won't be able to keep it up over the holidays... too much traveling.

I am so glad I found this!  A friend of mine had given me some starter and I had made two batches that I had given away.  Then I forgot to maintain it for a week and it went bad.  The friend who had given it to me did the same thing and we couldn't find anyone who had kept up with the starter.  This is fun and easy.  I make my bread into four mini loves and give this as a gift with the recipe, starter and one of the mini loaves in a pretty hand stamped bag.  My friends have all loved it!  I am going to give one to each of my boy’s teachers as teacher gifts!  Also, I put my starter into ziploc bags and massage the bag instaed of keeping it in a bowl and stirring.

I just made my first loaves of this bread and it was gone in a flash. My future daughter-in-law sent it to me as a Christmas gift. I see that it can be frozen, my questions is does it matter when you freeze the starter? I was thinking of popping one in to freeze for later use on day one? Also you can add things to it like nuts, chocolate chips etc..before baking.

This recipe is THE BEST.  #1 for how easy it is, and #2 for how versatile it is.  I hadn't made it in years and hubby came home from work about 10 days ago (LOL) with a starter from a co-worker.  I'm now at home full time but have 3 son-in-laws all in the military.  So I've decided to use up all of my batter except the re-starter 1-cup and bake breads & muffins to send over to the troops!!  (providing that the boys share LOL)  So if anyone else wants to bake for the troops and don't know a good recipient, I have several addresses to share.  Happy baking everyone!

This is a good recipe, but if you add the ingredients on the 10th day, you end up with 7 cups of starter instead of 4. I don't think you are supposed to add on the 10th day. Just bake.

Just wanted to give you an update on the how the recipe turned out (smile).  GREAT!!!!! So much so that I saved one of the starter bags for myself to make more.  The second time I included raisins, pecans and more cinnamon.  Everyone totally loved it!



I'm in the process of doing the friendship bread and I didn't know about getting the air out when I first received it and I received it on day FOUR!!!  I'll see what happens.

Great starter! I just made some and took it out of the oven. Yum! I used a recipe that a friend gave me that uses vanilla pudding. I did a big OOPS and used a metal whisk, but as soon as I realized what I was doing I removed the metal whisk and used a bamboo spoon. The bread still turned out fantastic! Also, I was away for two days over the weekend and just left the starter at room temp during days 6 & 7 and then picked up where I left off when I got back from vacation. No problems seemed to arise from being gone.

I am so glad I finally found this recipe, had it as a child and can't wait to start on it again.  I remember keeping it in plastic "Ziploc" bags and just kneading it in the bag, less mess and easier to store, etc.  I am going to try that with this recipe, should work out fine. I will update you all if it doesn't

My mother and I have been making Amish Friendship Bread for years. She and I have made several variations and haven't been disappointed by a single batch! This starter makes delicious bread, and is fun to make and share with friends. Instead of using a mixing bowl, I combine the ingredients in a gallon ziplock bag kneading the outside rather than mixing with a spoon. It works great and requires less clean up!

I ended up with a lot more than 4 cups starter at the end of the ten days.  Also, at the end of 40 minutes, mine was burned.  I know my oven is a little off, but not enough to justify the 10-20 minute cooking time difference.

Hi - love this bread but has anyone tried it with perhaps Splenda and whole wheat flour?  The calorie and carb count on this is pretty scary!  I wonder if it would work (and taste as good!) by substituing healthier ingredients? Any ideas? Now that I check again this count "per serving" must mean the whole starter not per serving of bread after baked because the Amish Friendship Bread Starter I has a much better count per serving after being made with the same recipe of starter!  Whew!!

This was such a fun recipe to give to my friends.  I gave each friend the starter with 2 recipes to make, plus the instructions to "grow" the starter.  The friends that decided to just bake have now decided to make their own starter since they enjoyed the bread so much.  I loved that the starter can be frozen.

My husband makes starter bread every 10 days and gives it away.  We have no one to give the starters to so he doubles the recipe and it turns out just fine.  He varies the flavoring from week to week so that his gifts don't get boring by adding pumpkin pie spice, apple pie spice, cake spice, ect.  He always adds 1/2 the cinnamon and then 1/2 the other flavor.  Also, he always doubles the vanilla.

I was given a bag of the starter for the amish bread, I made it , it was very good, but I forgot and used a wire wish, did not hurt it at all, I gave 3 bags of starter to friends and they also had great bread, i think the amish just does not want to use metal, and the reason you burp the air out of the bag makes a difference, if you don't it will spoil. i read somewhere on here that you let the air in, it is to let the air or gas out

Very easy and forgiving. for the feeding on day five I subbed hi gluten bread flour for the all purpose flour and brown sugar for the white sugar in the same amounts with great results. The starter comes out darker and has a more mild flavor! It's a keeper!

I was given this recently and wishing I had the recipe for the starter-thanks.  I have passed it on to my Mom and neighbors and they all enjoyed it very much.  I was kind of dreading it hanging around my kitchen, but I have acutually enjoyed the whole experience very much.

I was SOO sceptical about this recipe because whenever I opened up the ziploc bag that I mixed the ingredients in, the starter smelled sour and gross!  I was so close to throwing it away because I thought that I must have messed something up, but I decided to just stick to it.  I AM SO GLAD THAT I KEPT IT!  THIS STARTER MADE THE BEST BREAD EVER!  I used it with the recipe, Amish Cinnamon Bread, found on this website and gave it away to my mother-in-law.  I also love that I can just freeze the leftover starter so I can make some yummy bread every weekend.

Best starter recipe I have tried. Easy and fun to make... and it smells sooooooo good! When milk is needed, I try it to be at room temperature, like sugar and flour, for I think it is better in order to create activity in the starter.

Awesome recipe, used to make amish bread and then stopped and couldnt find anyone who had any to share. Now I can start it anytime. Great for gifts. I put the starter batch in a gallon ziplock bag and kneed the mixture thru out the day.On day 10, pour a cup of the starter into other ziplocks and give to friends (or freeze).

I love using this friendship starter.  I have some starter frozen for quick bread.  I also baked and froze several mini loaves and for a quick dessert. SMC

I loved the recipe! Had no problem getting it done the first time. I have one 1 cup of the starter remaining which I froze. I want to keepon making starters but am not sure if I can used the frozen cup I have to keep on making starters instead of using it for baking. Please let me know, anybody. 

Thanks,

I had used this starter moons ago & was delighted to be given a new starter 2 months ago. Before reading all the reviews I was ready to dump extra starters as I was having a hard time finding homes for my new "pets". All the hints about reducing the amount of feeder added on day 6 & day 10 are helpful. Best of all, I have read it's fine to freeze starter. I have found that adding 1 small box of pudding to the bread mix for baking works fine.

This starter has been going around and around my church and office for a while now so I'm glad that I can now take a little break and make it at a later time.  I kept making it because I didn't want to lose the starter.  I haven't tried freezing the starter, but the bread made with it freezes very well.  I'm so thankful for all of the suggestions from other reviews.  Next time I'll make it with bananas or apples or maybe even zucchini.  All sound yummy.

My friend uses this bread to make her bread pudding - talk about extra yummy.
It's great to eat alone, but if you are going to use all of your starteers at once, bread pudding is the way to go.

The flavor of the bread is kind of bland as is. Adding bananas, carrots or zuchini and walnuts would greatly improve it. 
It's fun starting this recipe and then passing it along to friends.

Very good and easy to do.  Years ago I had a starter going and in that recipe it told me to put the starter in a ziplock bag.  This worked perfectly.  On the days it said to stir, all I did was just mashed it with my hands.  This time I did it again and I also wrote on the bag and that allowed me to keep track of the days.  When I was done with that day, I would mark it off.  I hope this helps.

I'm very happy with this starter! The recipe was easy and I haven't killed it yet! I'm also able to freeze it, take it out of the freezer, and it springs back to life within a few hours! It had the soury taste even in my first batch.

The Sourdough Mystique

After mixing up some dough and letting it rise, you could go ahead and bake it. But that addictive yeasty flavor will be more pronounced if you whip up an initial yeast batter, or starter. Hard-core sourdough fans prefer to cultivate a wild starter by mixing organic flour with water and waiting for the airborne yeast to come feed; the good bacteria created by the aging culture produce the distinctive tang. But the problem with wild starters is that the flour-water-sugar trap left out for the yeast is often taken over by bad bacteria before the yeast is able to set up house. This can often result in a nasty-tasting and dangerous bread brew.

Proto-dough to the Rescue

I've created a commercial-wild yeast hybrid that achieves the best of both worlds: good flavor without the bad bacteria. The commercial yeast immediately dominates the culture and starts producing acid that isn't friendly to potentially harmful bacteria. Then it is safe to go wild by continuing to feed the batter, or proto-dough, with water and flour. In time, you'll have what is essentially a sourdough starter. My own proto-dough has been going for about eight months, and the breads I make with it are tasting better and better. I've found that by keeping a quart of proto-dough around, I can make sourdough-tasting bread in half the time. Not only does the yeast in the proto-dough serve as a microbial rapid deployment unit, but the goo it lives in is packed with flavor. Which means your bre

Don't worry if it doesnt bubble.  Mine doesnt always bubble either.  Just keep following the directions.

I love this recipe.  I make a batch of starter and then make a bunch of variations of the bread, freeze it and take a loaf out whenever I get a craving for sweetbread.

turned out just like I remembered it!  I'm so happy I found this recipe.
I use whole wheat flour and it still tastes good and not dry.  I make the bread with a recipe that calls for instant puding in the bread recipe.

I cannot begin to tell you how happy I am to have found this recipe!!  My mom used to make this all the time from starter she got from a friend!!  I have always wished I could find someone who had the starter, now I have the recipe for it!!  This is sooooo totally AWESOME!!  I cannot say Thank You enough to Ginger!  Thank You Thank You Thank You!!!!  I do want to make a note that this recipe makes 6 cups of starter, at least the two times I have done it.  However, when you start with just one cup of starter, the next time you will have only 4 cups.

I have received starters in the past and the bread is amazing.  I have tried twice now to create my own starter and it is not fermenting and bubbling like all the others I have done. I have always received them in a gallon size ziplock bag and told to keep it sealed and let the gas out each day.

I just made a friendship cake and I now have friendship waffles cooking. I used my kitchenaid mixer with a metal bowl and it did not affect my batter at all.  My waffles are looking awesome also in a metal cooking surface. I think the metal worries are unfounded.  Will not change a thing!

!!GREAT TIP!! Place the servings in 1 gallon bags with the date of Day 1 and Day 10 written on them. That way your friends can mush the mix in the bags with their children rather than having to stir it everyday. and if air gets in there you just open the bag a tiny bit and let the air out. The one gallon bag will be more than enough space for your friends to add the additional ingredients.

This recipe is amazing! The texture looks like it should be in a magazine. I made it for Thanksgiving and again for Easter. Everybody raves about it. It is a bit sweet, so as a dinner bread I cut the sugar and cinnimon in the loaf in half. It still could be cut down more. To serve for breakfast or with coffee it is great as printed.

I made this with regular sugar and flour and used soy milk. I think it turned out fine! The bread (I used Amish F'ship Bread I) doesn't need to bake as long as they say--still delicious though. Maybe try sifting flour and sugar together and mixing it with the milk before adding to starter!

I was given the starter last year and used it to make Christmas gifts for my friends and family last year and was disappointed when the starter ran out and I wasn't given any more for this year.  Now that I have found it here I will be able to use it again and again.  It is my favorite dessert and a favorite of my family!

This is the easiest thing to do.  If, at the end, you have noone to give the starters to, do them all yourself and freeze the loaves.  If the bag doesn't bubble everyday, no biggie. just squish and mush anyway.  It will be fine.  I live amongst the Amish and I can tell you they don't measure carefully or worry about how many bubbles were in the bag.  Just relax and enjoy!  BTW, i chop up apples in mine.  With the cinnamon... it is great!

I used Wheat Flour and Honey instead of Syrup and it taste amazing.  The Wheat does get alot of air in it though... Taste great and it alot healthier.

My Mom made this bread all the time when I was little, but her starter died.  I found this recipe online and she made a new batch of starter, and we got to try the first batch of muffins from this recipe saturday and they were exactly what I remembered!  Loaves are good, we like to make little muffins out of them.  If you can find a cornbread pan, that makes them even better.  The thickness and size works great for the recipe.  I also like to put cinnamon chips in mine.  Chocolate chips are good too.  Very easy to experiment and try new things with this recipe!

Growing up this was a special treat, that we could not have often; I recently tried one and it was not at all what I remember - so I did some research and found that today's breads are, as most things "quickened".. I do not prefer this kind- the authentic recipes are much bette. Another interesting thing I found out is that this bread is not Amish! Lol it can not be traced to them at all, isn't that funny?

Very good. More a cake than a bread, think banana bread texture.  Nice light cinnamon flavor.  I chopped a large granny smith apple into the batter before baking.  With all the sugar in the recipe it cut the sweetness.  I now have 3 cups of starter to freeze and one to use again.

I love this bread but I cannot eat much as I have food allergies. Has anyone made the starter with spelt flour or rice flour and use soy milk? Are the measurements the same for the ingredients?

I have always loves sourdough bread, however the thought of making it myself was always scary. I came across this starter recipe one day while having a major craving for a good slice of sourdough bread.  I decided to put my craving on hold for several days and try to make this starter.  Boy, talk about worth the wait!! I took the full 10 days and was very careful to feed and stir my baby blob on the correct days.    After reading for days about how to store, rise and bake sourdough I finally made my first loaves.  They were no sooner out of the oven and my hovering family devoured them.  I did have better luck with rising the second batch after warming the oven slightly and putting a pan of very hot water on the bottom shelf.  I learned sourdough takes longer to rise than traditional yeast breads.  In about 90 minutes I had a beautiful mound of sour goodness.  The entire time the loaves were baking the kids were swarming the oven asking when it was gonna be ready to eat.  My oldest said it smelled amazing and it did!! If you love sourdough, invest the time and love it takes to make this starter.  It is well worth it!! My only problem is I don't want to give any away!!!

I have been making this bread, for a long time.. but recently I started making it in cupcake pans.. easier to store, freeze and eat..  I have added chocolate chips (3/4 cup, and 1 cup walnuts, or our FAVORITE is to add 3/4 of craisins and 1 cup chopped pecans..  everyone loves this.... I just froze a starter last week, because like everyone stated, once you start you can't quit unless you just throw it out...and what a waste that would be.   We love the muffins and everyone I have shared it with have  expressed the same.   Sandy

I made this starter and baked the bread, but I didn't see where it said not to use metal containers or utensils when making this.  The bread turned out okay but it was a little dry and overdone.

I just wanted to answer someone who was concerned that her starter was not bubbly.  When my mom gave me her starter it was not bubbly at all.  Once I got it home, and especially after I added the ingredients on day 5 it really started fermenting.  I think the temp. in her kitchen was too cool, but it seems fine now.

Great to find the starter recipe.  I've been baking it four four months and have a harder time finding friends without the starter.  Anyway,  I bake the bread on day 10, but I also bake the starters, that don't get given away, up to a week after they've been bagged up!  (of course, I keep one back to feed) That way we can have the bread basically any time we want it, not just every ten days.  The variations like lemon poppy seed and chocolate chocolate chip are terrific!

I got my starter from a friend but have been 'keeping' it for about six years. It is really not that difficult. If it is fed every 3-4 days 1/2 - 1 cup of each, flour sugar, milk it will keep active. If you have too much just put it in the freezer until ready to bake again. It will come back to 'life' in a couple of hours, feed it and get ready to bake again :-). I keep mine in a 2 quart pitcher. I love it for many cake and muffin recipes.

So happy that I found this! A friend of mine years ago gave me a started and the kids loved it. I lost the recipe, the kids will be so excited that I found it again. There are so many ways that you can vary the recipe to make breads.

Not exactly sure how to rate this. I followed "Olga"'s recipe from the first page on how to make traditional starter---1c milk-1c flour and 1c sugar.  Let it sit 5 days and repeated. On day 10 I made my bread and it came out FLAT and extremely sugary. It may have been me as a novice but I will follow a recipe with less sugar and with yeast next time.

Awesome starting point. I made this in baggies instead (& good thing I did. We took an emergency 18 hr trip on day 6-10. Not possible with a casserole dish.) and "mushed" them every day. I did try this with Splenda (straight splenda, not a baking mix) & used the bread 1 recipe on this site. The splenda bag would balloon up within minutes, but not have any more air until the next day you add ingrediants. It also smelled a lot more sour than the suger mix. This was controlled (same flour, milk, & yeast in both) so I would expect the same disappointing results every time. May work with Splenda + sugar baking mix.

I freeze mine in 2 1/8c. pkgs, some always stays in the bag. I buy instant pudding mix at the bulk stores & then follow the basic recipe. Last one I made was Cranberry, with cranberry relish & Nantucket mix. I make double recipes, get about 8 3"x5" loaves. Give as gifts at the Holidays. I've never had anyone complain about any of them, you can go as far as you want with the basic recipe, adding whatever you want

Hi DEB - The recipie is correct as it reads (and delicious).  The ingredient list notes that flour and sugar are 3 cups divided.  When you read the instructions you use 1 cup of each on day 1, day 5 and day 10.  Note this recipie is just the starter - you then need to use  your favorite Amish Bread Recipie on day 10.  Hope this clarifies the question you were asking DEB.  Ask again if this is confusing.

I had been searching for this starter recipe for about a year and was so happy to finally find it.I made Amish Cinnamon Bread with it and it was delicious!The only problem I had was when I started my second batch of starter, it rose so much that it spilled over the top of my half gallon container!

I am sooo happy that I finally found this recipe!! Many years ago a friend of mine gave me a starter and we had such a good time making many different kinds of breads. But then I moved away and I never did get the starter part from my friend and she passed away a year after I moved. Now I make at least 2 different breads every week and pass the starters to other friends and then we share with each the different kinds of breads we have made. This is such fun and easy to make. They make great gifts for the holidays as well.

I first ran into this recipe 35 years ago when I was married to a man who HATED fruitcake. We had always had fruitcake for Christmas & New Year's so I knew my family would expect it. I made my basic fruitcake using this as a base, added a little cardamom to make it more like what he was used to from northern Europe and Voila! best Christmas cake ever! You can make it with anything... pumpkin, sweet potatoes, zucchini, actually any grated squash, carrots, parsnips, beets, potatoes (amp up the spices a little), apples, pears, firm peaches or plums, figs, raisins, dates, currants, gooseberries, aronia, goji, loganberries, honeyberries, blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, cranberries or blueberries (fresh or dried), any dried fruit, any nuts (I prefer them unsalted), or mix them up however you like for your own unique fruitcake recipe. Yes, you may make it with soy, rice or almond or other nut milk, you just may need to adjust for consistency on day 10. Experiment! Use your imagination! Same with spices. Try mace instead of nutmeg (gentler); allspice in place of cloves. Cardamom has been my secret ingredient for years. Those who have never had those crispy, brown German Christmas cookies usually don't recognise the flavor. So, maybe a batch doesn't turn out so well. You'd be amazed what does. Yellow beets or carrots will have everyone wondering. Whenever I had starter left over, I just baked it & sent it to work with my husband, or gave it to my stepsons to share around.

Problem I have with this:  something not right in the last instruction.  After starting with 3 cups of flour, 3 cups of sugar and 3 cups of milk, then, during the process adding another 2 cups of flour, 2 cups sugar and 2 cups of milk, you have way more than 4 cups of starter.  Other recipes say to remove 4 cups of starter and use the remaining starter to make bread with.  My first batch was terribly runny and all the additions sank to the bottom.

It worked beautifully with the Amish Friendship Bread I recipe.  I caught wild yeast though instead of using store bought yeast.  See the Sourdough no commercial yeast recipe for how to start the sourdough and then start adding the milk, sugar and flour after the sourdough starter is done with its first cycle.

I have tried making this starter twice now, both times it turned out well. I just don't see the point of investing my time to make a 10 day starter for a soda bread. It doesn't add enough to the flavor, I baked some Amish breads leaving the starter out. May-be I'm doing something wrong as this has  5 stars overall.

Great starter.  I think I had a total of 6 cups when day 10 came around, so I had more than the recipe says, but that's even better!  More to pass out and some left over to start the process all over again!

This was great! I still have tons in my freezer. We can't finish two loaves of bread before it goes bad, so I always send some to work with my husband and it's always a hit. I'm oing to give this recipe to my mother when I visit this summer, she's been looking for it for a while as well. (: Thanks so much!

This is a nice enough sweet dessert-y bread. But I just finished my first batch and my suspicions are confirmed. It is unnecessary to go through the whole 10 day period of mixing and waiting, etc. If you think about what you are creating, you will understand. You start with a gift of what is essentially a yeast sourdough base. You then feed the yeast over the course of the 10 days and then make your bread. Here's my problem with the whole thing: once you have built up this fabulous baggie full of yeast and sourdough base, you add whatever flavor ingredients you want and throw it in the oven. The last step completely negates the fact that you have a yeasty mixture!  You don't let the bread raise from the CO2 produced by the yeast! You add a bunch of ingredients and bake it...those ingredients include leaveners such as baking powder and baking soda. So although this bread is relatively tasty (especially when you add a handful of white chocolate and butterscotch chips!) waiting the 10 days is just unnecessary.  I would be willing to bet if you took all of the ingredients and threw them together and put them in the oven, you would get the same result. (With the exception of whatever yeasty flavor the yeast mixture adds).

My husband and I love it when we receive a bag of Amish Friendship Bread starter, the bread always tastes so good when we finally get to bake it! Problem is we didn't have any starter and had been wanting to make it again for some time. Luckily I happened upon this recipe for the starter. It turned out great and I was able to introduce 2 friends to this process who had never heard of it! I am going to try what another reviewer said, freeze the extra bags and when I am ready for another round just go through the 10 day process without adding to until its time to bake! When I am on my last bag of starter I can do the 10 days as normal to recoup the extras in my freezer.

2 loaves in the oven now!  Agree with Mom 81549 on 6/27/12- you end up with much more batter than you are led to believe- I ended up with 7 cups!  Another review has the same bread recipe I have (cinnamon) that says take out the 4 cups and "add" rest of ingredients to the remaining- but hers was too thin( that's because  she was left with 3 cups of batter) I just use the 1 cup and all works well. And yes- you can double (in 2 separate bowls) & make 4 loaves at same time

My sister-in-law was leaving on a trip the day before making the bread so gave me the starter. I knew I wouldn't have time for another 5 days so I fed it. Her's was in a zippy bag so it was easy to keep. I was at a loss and left the bag open, didn't want an accidental explosion. By the time I was ready, the mixture was VERY sour-smelling but figured I'd try anyway. Also had to use Butterscotch pudding mix. I wasn't sure how much starter to use so I guessed at 1 1/2 cups. Well... it WORKED!!! Very tasty, not sour, not too sweet. I'm    quite amazed.

I had received the info on how to make this bread but it did not include the starter; which I received here. Thank you for posting it. Now I can make it and pass it on.

Thank you!  I was given this starter years ago and after passing it around friends for nearly a year, the chain was finally broken.  We all regretted it.  Lots of new friends were made and lots of delicious bread was baked.  Thank you again!

Great recipe, made a good batch of friendshop bread with this starter, it takes time, but its worth it. I had this once when I was a little girl, and I loved it. But the recipe was gone, so when I found this I set my mind to make it, I was not dissapointed, Thanks!

I once was given this starter many years ago to make, and once I finished all
the loaves I wanted to make, I just stopped making the starter.  I have been 
looking for the recipe to start the starter again since then, so I thank you for 
sharing this wonderful recipe with everyone.  Well worth the effort!

This turned out just like I remember, yum,  The recipe I have always used is like Baked, exactly.  
I have also done what others have said and bake each week, by only starting with 1/4 cup mixes and additions.  So perfect.  I don't share starts, I bake them all, I give alot away, share baked goods with my kids at church

This starter batter was going well. I have active yeast for the sour dough, and the right ingredients to add to make it a Thanksgiving Pumpkin bread (pumpkin puree, spices, and nuts).  So, I realize that I was getting carried away as I added the 1 cup pumpkin puree on the 5th day (NOT the 10th day = BAKING DAY)! You are wondering if the batter went rancid? Nope. All set on Day 10, I added a second 1 cup of pumpkin puree, not too much spices, 4 tbsp of oil, 2 cups of flour, 2 medium eggs. Just so you know, the batter is quite gum-like. I cooked mine at a lower-temp for longer to make sure it was completely cooked!!

This is the perfect starter and very easy to accomplish. I was once given a starter from a friend but never made extra or kept it going. After making the bread, I wished I had because it's so good (especially with coffee). Finding this recipe was a big deal and it's 5 stars all the way!

I just used this starter with the Amish Chocolate Bread found on this site.  I only added 1 cup mini chocolate chips and otherwise followed that recipe.  It is great.  My starter worked out perfectly.  I have seen several variations of the 10 day process, and they have all worked well.  I'm glad to finally find a starter recipe I can begin on my own!

I've had such bad luck with starters that I was dreading starting this one. I had no reason to worry. This one was perfect! I couldn't be happier. I called my Dad and told him about it and found out that this is the same starter he used for the friendship bread he made for us kids when we were little. I can't wait to get started baking my friendship bread. Thank you times infinity for the person who shared this recipe.

I love Friendship Bread but get sick of it after a few weeks.  FYI, if you use a metal  spoon/whisk to mix, the batter will kind of poop out - stop bubbling and separate.  So throw it away if you forget, and start new.  Also, you can make it into muffins for breakfast.  Like zucchini bread?  Add shredded zucchini instead of coconut (Or in comination).  My toddler cousin LOVED his mommy's yummy muffins, and she added zucchini and stuff to make them guilt-free for her.

My mother made this when I was younger and I recently rediscovered it. I baked the bread and brought it to work. Everyone loved it so it was easy to pass around the extra batter. Best compliment was that it tasted like a huge cinnamon roll.

Oh such a wonderful starter, and it takes five days less than most starters to begin cooking with.  I took the Plain and Simple Sourdough recipie and added the Amish starter to it as well as 3 table spoons of sugar to the warm water and yeast mix (tradition method, no bread machine used).  The bread came out tasting like Chalah bread! This one is a keeper in my reciepe book!  I LOVE IT!!

I am so thankful to find this recipe. I have been making this for a while (following my own recipe) and haven't made it in the past couple years. :( I lost my recipe and was saddened. This bread is amazing!!! I also keep mine in a gallon size zip-lock bag, and "burp" the bag when the air accumulates. This is by far the greatest gift you could ever give someone, and tastes amazing to boot!

Glad to find this recipe again after 8 years! I used to make muffins for my daycare kids and they loved it for breakfast and snacks.  I made several different batches at one baking time then froze for later use. Easy to serve.

Sourdough starter is new to me.  I'm not sure how to rate this recipe.  I followed the directions exactly but by the 10th day it was really noxious and frothy.  I guess that's how it's supposed to be but I was worried I had ruined my starter because it's been so hot this summer.  It seemed outrageous to use something that had been sitting around so long with milk in it.  I made bread with it and the bread turned out okay but it wasn't great.  It might not have been the starters fault on the recipe I had tried.  I'll try something again in a few days after I've fed my new pet.

I was trying to duplicate the friendhsip bread I rememebred from growing up, but I think I did something wrong, because I ended up with 6+ cups of starter instead of four.  I stuck the extra in the freezer.  The smell was right, but next time I will try another bread recipe.

This was really good.  My 5 yr old girls looked forward to stirring everyday.  Yummy.  Get a friendship bread recipe that uses pudding mix.  My favorite is the Banana Cream Pudding Mix.  We can't get enough of it.

I love making this! And so does my best friend. Everyone else loves to eat it, but they 'can't be bothered' with the 10 days... If you freeze it, it keeps very well. Just remember where you are in the 10 days, and pick up where you left off! So, so, so yummy! You can also use a flavored pudding when baking to change the taste, but using the vanilla is the best, in my opinion. Banana is a close second.

I have been making this for years! It is ALWAYS a huge hit! You can freeze the starter bags and it actually comes out even better after I swear! You just start it at day 1 once you remove it from the freezer. It is ridiculously delicious and addictive! Worth the time!!!

I used to have this and made it all the time in college.  I loved making it into muffins with chocolate chips and pumping up the spice.  Nutmeg helped as did clove.  I loved adding fruit that was aging faster than I could eat it.  


A very useful thing I did was to measure the amount left after the division and learning that you ended up with about 5 cups of starter at day 10 so you could freeze yours and make a double batch of the recipe and have plenty.  This way if you have no one to share it with, no worries!  Or freeze one cup measures and make a half batch when you wanted them and didn't have 10 days to wait.  


It also freezes well after being baked so it was great to freeze those muffins and take them in my lunch.  If they weren't thawed enough, I could microwave them and since they were frozen when I arrived at school/work they didn't crush in the lunch bag.  Bonus: they were an ice pack for the rest of my lunch on hot days.

I love this recipe and I always ask before day 10 who wants one.  If no one does I simply use the other cups that I would have given away to make more bread.  I take it into work or give it to my husband for his co-workers.  You can find plenty of folks who love the bread just might not be good at baking etc.  But I always keep one for myself as I love to bake.

I made this to use on Paula Deans Cinnamon Rolls and of course some amish friendship bread.  Turned out great.  Had fun doing the whole process for the first time also.  Thanks from KY.

I did not make any  changes to this recipe, and have been making this exact starter for the past 25 years. I have been making about 100 loaves of bread a year if not more for the past 15 years. It's always great and makes great gifts for lots of people for the holidays or for any time.  It freezes well and will not go rancid if left on the counter for months if stirred and fed  sporadically.  It is a great recipe and is always good when I make the Amish Friendship Cinnamon Bread.

I have a question, can this starter be made with gluten free flour, almond or rice milk?  We have a bunch in our house that can not tolerate gluten or dairy.
Thank you

We first got this one from another parent at Sunday School .  We like this one because of the  possibilities with adding pudding to the finished starter. We have a bread lover in our house (seriously, she asks for loaves of bread for her birthday  rather than cake), this is a favorite! We don't usually give these out, we ran out of folks to hand them out to a long time ago! But food goes so fast in our house too that we usually save one starter and use all of batter to make bread at that time, then there's enough that the kids might actually share a slice or two with their friends!

When I Make The Sour Doe Cinnamon Bread I Also Put Raisins or  "Currents" Smaller Than Raisins n Sweeter:) Also I Put Butter Scotch n Van. Pudding  In It Ev1 Loves It:) I Also Put A Few Start's In My Freezer n They Work Great n The One I Make Doesn't Call For Any Yeast.. And One Year For Christmas I Made A lot Of These n Family's Got A Whole Bread n Single Got Half:) Then In The Long Run These Breads Were Cheaper Than Christmas Cards:) Even The Ones Half Price After The Holidays:) I'm In AA n My Home Group I Did This For n There Were About 30 Members n Other Members I Did This With:) Loved It n My HOUSE Smelled Soooooooooooo Good n I Can't Eat Any Of It. Allergic Too Eggs Dairy n Nuts? N Ev1 Else Isn't That's Why I Do It:)

Very good make it all the time. 
  Instead of finding friends to give starter to, I make extra loafs of bread and give them away or freeze the extra loaves for later that always get eaten
