I made a no-sugar version that turned out really well.  Here's how you can do it: put 10 prunes in a measuring cup and fill with water to the 3/4 cup level.  Microwave for 3-4 minutes until boiling and then let it sit for 5 minutes.  Puree this and use it instead of the sugar. I also reduced the oil to just 2 Tbs.  The muffins were light and fluffy!

Great Flavor!  I made a few changes-applesauce for the oil, no salt, no baking soda, salt free baking powder, only used 1/4cup white flour-substituting 10 grain, whole wheat, oat bran and wheat germ for the remainder.  I also added extra banana-using only very ripe ones.  I also used only 1/4cup sugar.  They were great.  The whole family loves them.  I may try next time to use less sugar since the fruits are very sweet alone.

I'm not normally a prune eater, but I accidentally bought a box of prunes instead of raisins, so...I made these muffins and they were WONDERFUL!  My husband and children thought they were scrumptious and they didn't turn up their nosees because they were eating prunes.  I have made them a couple of times now!

SO good and SO simple. Definitely dredged your chopped prunes in flour to prevent sinking - I did and it was nice to have the prunes evenly distributed for eating :-)  Kids devoured these as well. YUM!

Wow, how impressive is this recipe!  I bought a large pack of prunes only to find my kids no longer liked them.  This worked perfect!  The only thing I did different was added 2 tsp cinnamon and 3/4 cup chocolate chips but everything else was the same.  And I finely chopped the prunes (to stop them sticking in teeth like one reviewer said happened) like I would herbs.  This is a deceptive recipe cause you see prune and think 'uh, no' but you CANNOT taste the prunes and have passed the kid and hubby test!  FABULOUS!  I also doubled the recipe and got 22 muffins.  Totally using again and dare anyone to give it a go ;)

The dough seemed quite hard and gloopy when I put these in muffin papers, and so I cooked them for 25 minutes and let them cool. I bit into one this morning with caution as they seemed a bit weird, but they tasted really good! Appearances can be deceiving! I guess maybe next time I will add some more banana, as looking back I realised I had only put one banana in as opposed to one cup, whoops. They were still really good though.

Carefully followed recipe except added a bit more vanilla extract.  I hand mixed everything so I wouldn't overmix.  A good recipe to use up over ripe bananas and unwanted prunes.  Nice banana flavor.  Very pretty presentation with all the cracks on the top.  Fine crumb texture - lovely!  Because I like my baked goods sweet - I might add more sugar next time.  Only complaint - prunes really stick to your teeth.

These are very good--moist and flavourful. I will def. make again, may try dates instead of prunes but the prunes were fine. Forgot to share the Weight Watcher points! 4 points per muffin. Thanks Lisa.

I made a few changes: subbed whole wheat flour for half the white flour; subbed half the sugar with Splenda;cut the prunes to 1/2 cup and dredged the pieces in some of the flour; increased the cinnamon to 3/4 tsp. Delicious and less calories.

Kids loved it!  I found it a little bland but I am slowly moving away from processed foods.  I imagine it will be some time before I will really be able to taste the goodness of what I am baking.

These muffins seem a bit odd at first with the prunes, but once you get used to the idea, they're really pretty tasty. A nice, healthy breakfast food. Better-tasting the second day after the spices have developed their flavor in the muffins.

An easy to make moist muffin.  I liked them warm out of the oven.  I think adding some nuts would make these muffins perfect.  The prunes should be cut as small as possible. My husband found them bland, so sorry, I won't be making these again.

I have three nuggets of advice: If that box of avoided prunes in your pantry are hard as rocks- don't fret. Before adding to this recipe, cover with water in a sauce pan, bring to boil, allow to sit and plump, then drain (but save the juice- it'll be good for something). They will add up to more than 1 C after plumping, but that didn't mess up the recipe for me. I just added some extra wheat germ and flax seed and it was perfectly moist (added plus of extra nutrients). SECOND: If- like me- you didn't read the label when you bought your prunes they have pits, don't fret. Its easy. Using either a knife, or a clean thumb, slip it down along the pit and squish it out. THIRD: I know this is good as-is, :) but, being a chocolate lover, I added 1 T coco powder, and pressed in 3 chocolate chips on the top of each one. MMM. Try it!!

The name will turn your guests off, but I guarantee that they'll eat two. I made mini-muffins, and they came out great. I used half of the sugar, and I didn't cut up the date enough. Next time, I'll cut them into smaller pieces so that the prune taste isn't so overpowering.

All my bananas were green, so I substituted two 4-oz. jars of banana baby food.  Although the muffins weren't glamorous, they were moist and healthy, and I would make them again.

These were fine, but nothing outstanding.  I don't know that I will make them again.  Flavor was a little bland.  Maybe more banana next time?

I made this hoping it would be something I could fix for a client that does not like prunes as much as I do. Wellllll it was AWESOME. I was so surprised when I went to take a bite I was prepared to gag and spit it out. I ended up eating another. :)

Wonderful!!!I made these muffins 2 days ago,doubled the recipe and froze them. We can thaw them in the microwave for 15 seconds. My family loves them for snacks and a quick breakfast. Wouldn't change a thing. Thank you Lisa. :)

Really like this recipe.  It's not that they're not moist but they are a bit rubbery.  It may be because I substituted applesauce for the oil but I've done that in many other muffin recipes without any issues.  The texture doesn't bother me though and they were great!  I highly recommend them!

I thought these muffins were quite good but not mind-blowingly so.  Although they were very moist and tender, they didn't go down a storm with my team of dedicated eaters, and I had to put several uneaten muffins into the bin as a result.  (I think it was their passive aggressive way of telling me not to adulterate the sacrosanct banana muffin.)

Amazing! The batter seemed a little dry to me, so I added a tablespoon of milk, but they came out great! Also, using the packaged pitted prunes with orange essence worked well!

We found these muffins to be bland, not very tasty. I did like using the prunes. I told my kids they were plums. I highly recommend cutting them into tiny pieces as a previous reviewer mentioned. I followed the recipe exactly as written. All in all, they weren't bad just not good enough to make again.

I use this often, too bad prunes have such a poor acceptence, they are so very nutritious. I always use half white whole wheat and half non-bromated unbleached flour. They are great for us.

Loved these!!  I have a bunch of prunes in my pantry and a few bananas on my counter getting overly ripe so this made a great combination.  I can't wait to take them into work tomorrow.  They were super-delish right out of the oven!!

Very nice muffins.  I didn't have prunes so I used currants, although I wish I had prunes to try with this!  Still, the muffins are very good.  Sweet from the fruit and flavorful.  They are a little dense but I like them that way.  Thanks for the recipe!

I always look for ways to make healthier versions:  I omitted the sugar entirely as the fruit is sweet enough for me, subbed applesauce for oil, 2 tbsp egg whites instead of egg, added a spoon of plain non-fat yogurt, 1 C spelt flour and 1/2 C whole wheat pastry flour instead of all-purpose, increased baking powder to 1&1/4 tsp, dash more baking soda, increased cinnamon to 1/2 tsp, added 1 tbsp of flax, baked 20 min  :)    After muffins cool, I put them in the fridge overnight then wrap each one in clingfilm and put them in a Ziploc bag in the freezer - take a muffin out night before for a morning muffin on the run or take it out of the freezer and put it in your lunch bag.

Not delicious, but good. I'm always searching for new foods that sneak in multiple fruits or vegies my kids otherwise would't touch. My only substition was to use 1 cup wheat flour and 1/2 cup white flour. The previous reviewers were right - small children think the prunes are raisins. My raisin hater would't touch the muffins and my raisin lover wolfed them down thinking she was eating raisins. Also be sure to chop the prunes in small pieces - they are very sticky and tend to clump together. Thanks for sharing a good recipe!

Trying to make some quick and reasonably healthy breakFASTs. Had some prunes on hand and found this recipe. I susbstituted apple sauce for most of the oil and soaked my prunes in orange juice before adding. I don't think I had the full cup of prunes nor did I have enough banana but it seemed to work out. Overall they were bland but certainly edible.

This was easy to make, whipped it up all by hand.  Stuck to recipe with the exception of adding 2oz. of walnut pieces with the diced prunes.  Used PAM No-Stick Cooking Spray with a dusting of flour on bottom of loaf pans, baked for 25 mins, cooled for a few mins and then turned loaf pan over onto cookie sheet.  Loafs are moist, not too sweet but very yummy with the prunes and added crunch of the walnuts.  We sliced into the warm loafs, added butter to our pieces and were delighted.

I sat these on the counter to cool, came back, and my husband (who hates bananas and prunes)had eaten 3 already.  He thought the prunes were raisins. I didn't change a thing in the recipe; they're quite good as is.  I used paper liners and they peeled right off.  I will definitely make these again.  Next time I'll try using a little of the flour when chopping the prunes.  They are
so sticky.

We really enjoyed these muffins- great texture and the taste was unique in a good way.  The prunes added a nice sweetness without being overwhelmingly "pruney" or too sweet like raisins.  I subbed 1/2 c whole wheat flour which made them maybe a little tougher, but still tasty!

Excellent recipe. I took others advice and dusted the prunes with flour to keep them from sinking to the bottom of the tin. They have a nice banana flavor and are moist and fairly dense. I don't understand the "bland" comments at all. This muffins are nice balance of flavor in my humble opinion. Great way to use up overly ripe bananas and you get a bit of fiber from the prunes. Thanks, for the recipe!

This has become a favorite recipe.  I like the recipe as is, but sometimes, for variety, I use ½ walnut oil & ½ canola oil and add walnuts.

After the holidays, I had some prunes to use up and this looked like a good recipe to try. I also had about 3/4 cup chopped cranberries (from frozen) that I was planning to use for bread or cookies, but decided not to make at this time. I ended up putting the cranberries, less than a tablespoon of orange zest and two tablespoons of orange juice into the mixture. I started to measure the mashed bananas (two medium bananas) but it looked like it came to just over a cup so I used it all. Thinking the cranberries might make the mixture too tart, I added another 1/8 cup of sugar. I meant to add 1/2 cup of walnuts, but forgot. 

They turned out great. Some might like sweeter muffins. The nuts with the ingredients I used would have made them perfect. My rating is for the adjusted recipe but I think the original which gave me the base would have been great too.

I was excited to try this recipe, as I love bananas and prunes. The batter seemed much thicker and stickier than most muffins I've made, but they came out wonderful--dense and moist, not chewy. I 'healthified' the recipe by using 1 c. white whole wheat flour & 1/2 c. all-purp flour, and I also decreased the sugar to 1/4 c and used brown sugar instead of white. I added 1/2 c. chopped walnuts for the great fat they provide. Next time I'll try adding wheat bran and substituting honey for the sugar ... yum!

Thanks for the recipe, my 2-1/2 year old grandaughter REALLY NEEDS prunes in her diet and we made these together. I had some really ripe pears that needed to be eaten, so I used one cup of them instead of bananas. We made mini muffins so they are easy for her to eat. She loves them and so do I. Mom and Grandpa also had their share. Did substitute 1/2 cup WW flour for more fiber, still moist and delish. Thanks again.

These are fabulous. Fantastic muffins.. 
I followed the recipe to a T..the only thing i altered was that i didnt use the full amount of the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon part.. i left back perhaps 3 tablespoons.. It wasnt necessary else the muffins would have been too dry

BUt..! this recipe is a definite keeper

What a fabulous muffin! Very moist and delicious. I used dates instead of prunes because that's what I had on hand. I also only had one banana, so I made up the difference with vanilla yogurt. This is definitely a keeper. I'll be making these again soon.

A good way to use the dried prunes.  I would cut up the prunes even smaller next time.  The kids noticed the difference from raisins, and it was not his favorite.  I'm going to add more spices next time too....nutmeg, cinnamon

We are totally in to muffins just like this one.  In keeping with my usual muffin-making, I did change this up just a bit----but still keeping with the original recipe.  I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour as part of the flour, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, half brown and half white sugar, and dried plums (is there a difference with plums and prunes?).  We will like having these with our morning coffee.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are delicious! I only used 1 large banana, and I added 1/3 of a cup toasted almonds, 1/4 cup milk, 2 tablespoons sour cream, 1 teaspoon almond extract , 1 tablespoon of ground almonds and  1/2 a teaspoon more baking powder. Although with the almond flavorings, I didn't use the cinnamon. Next time I may try supplementing something else for the prunes.

Tastes pretty good. Substituted white cane sugar for applesauce and instead of pitted prunes went the easier route with prune purée for my picky eater. Tasty and sweet. Added white chocolate chips.

Used other people’s suggestions; chopped prunes with flour, and used1/2 Splenda, 1/2 sugar and wheat flour.  Added 1 tsp of cinnamon (hubby can never have enough cinnamon).    Hubby loved them, I thought they were ok.   Would add walnuts next time for a little more texture.

4.22.19 I think prunes often have an “image problem,” simply because many people don’t understand they’re just dried “plums.”  Don’t often do this, but I took some liberty with this recipe based on reading the reviews.  My opened pkg of diced prunes had been sitting around for a while and were VERY dry/brittle, so I rehydrated them in some boiling water for about 5 minutes, then drained (made them super tender in the muffins). Almond is a good complement to dried plums, so I sub’d almond extract for the vanilla and increased it to 1-1/2 tsp.  I also used Truvia® Baking Blend and Egg Beaters® as subs for the sugar and eggs, but stayed true to the amounts in the recipe.  A good number of reviewers said these muffins were bland, but these were some of the tastiest muffins I’ve had in a very long time, simply chockablock full of flavor.  With the first bite, you get the incredible sweetness from the prunes, then the subtle banana kicks in.  They’re moist, tender, just perfect muffin texture.  For a variation on flavor, I could see adding some lemon zest, allspice, pecans, or walnuts.  I know, I know, I made changes to this recipe, but this was a total success today, and I will make these muffins the same way in the future.  This was a superb breakfast muffin this morning.

Great recipe, have made many times! I cut down the sugar some because the bananas are so ripe and sweet and I’ve used a gluten free flour mix that was a hit too. I also added flax seed for a healthy boost. Overall a great recipe that I will continue to make!

I like the taste. they smell good. but i used fruit preserves (mixture of bluberry, cranberry, pomegranate, acai) instead of pitted prunes. added 1/4 sugar because the preserves has a bit of sourness.

Muffins weren't too sweet but did taste bland. You could barely taste the banana or the prunes unless you were directly biting a prune bite. I baked them in a mini muffin tin so that may of been the case. Muffins were not as moist as other reviews mentioned.

I wanted to try prunes because I had heard they are quite healthy, but didn't like snacking on them by themselves (too mushy for my taste). I found this recipe and made it exactly how it said and loved the result.  They baked up very nicely and taste great!

This recipe is simple and the muffins are DELICIOUS! Hot muffins with cold milk.  This recipe made me forget how much I've always disliked prunes.   Hahaha...

they are great tasting bananas, however, i did not have the correct amount of bananas, but I will make sure I do next time. 
Great flavours, i did add more cinnamon as well.  My husband ate all 12 of them in two days!!! Needless to say they were a hit.

These were super yummy! Very moist and cooked perfectly. I used coconut oil and added a half a cup of walnuts. Next time I will use MORE walnuts. Also, I put my prunes in the food processor with a teeny bit of water after I couldn't chop them via any other method. I recommend just going with a food processor or blender right away. :-) This dough is extremely thick when it's all mixed up, almost like bread dough. But don't be Scared, when you bake them they will be beautiful. ;-)

I was excited to try these based on reviews. I did add chocolate chips to the recipe. The texture was nice, but the flavor was a bit odd. We ate them warm and maybe they will be better cold??  They weren't bad, we just didn't LOVE them.

It was ok.  I love prunes, but I think this recipe is lacking the banana punch that it needs.  One cup of bananas may not be enough.  The name of the muffins constitutes what seems to be, a banana bread flavored muffin with prunes.  Hands down, I make an awesome banana bread, and I was hoping to get more flavor than what this recipe yielded.  I'll attempt again with some modifications and post an update with my changes.

Made as specified with just a couple substitutions. substituted splenda for sugar and used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup all purpose flour. Muffins turned out with lots of banana flavor and very light and fluffy. The kids ate several and I enjoyed too. Will definitely make again.  Added a handful of walnuts too for extra nutrition.

I made these in the hopes that my toddler would have a quick (high fiber) breakfast on the way to the gym. Omitting the sugar, I used the prune syrup (as recommended in previous reviews) by microwaving prunes in water then pureeing them. I also cut up other prunes and dredged them in flour. I only used 2 TBSP of oil. Cinnamon is awesome, so I added a very generous amount. Lastly, I blended rolled oats in my blender and substituted about 3/4 cup of the all purpose flour with this.

I baked 22 minutes, but could have done 21. I was out of toothpicks. They were still very moist and my toddler and 10 month old LOVED them! They stuck a little to the paper liners I used, but not too bad. We will be making these again. I may even substitute applesauce for the oil next time.
