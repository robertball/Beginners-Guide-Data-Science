I love this recipe but I made a few changes. First I used half the butter. Secondly I seasoned the cheese mixture with italian seasoning and garlic for flavor. Finally instead of just using meat mixture on top I layered it noodles, cheese mixture, meat, and cheddar& mozzarella cheese and repeated That a second time. It came out delicious and my family absolutely loved it. Will definitely make this again!!!!!!

It was allright but I think it needs a lot more tomato sauce and half of the cream cheese mixture is enough. I started with sauce so you do not need the butter. With these modifikations it is probably really good!

LOVED this recipe! I make it with rigatoni noodles and instead of 1 lb. of ground beef I do 1/2 lb. ground beef and 1/2 lb. sausage... it adds TONS of flavor and send it over the top!! I have VERY picky eaters in my house so I buy extra spaghetti sauce and mix the cheese mixture in with the spaghetti sauce REALLY WELL, so that they don't know there's cream cheese in it. I add a little extra sauce because we like it really saucy.

This was a disappointment for us. I didn't really understand the need for the butter so I didn't use it all.  I assembled the casserole as directed and baked it 30 minutes uncovered, as it did not say to cover but it really should have been covered. Some of the noodles on top got too dried out.  I topped with Mozzarella cheese instead of cheddar.  The layer of cream cheese, sour cream and cottage cheese was just that, a layer of rich cheese with little to no flavor - the top was dry - the middle too cheesy, yet bland.   The kids might like this with more sauce added to it.  Overall, we weren't thrilled.  Sorry, I wanted to like this recipe.

I have made this dish several times, and it is absolutely delicious. I have to stop myself from eating the entire pan.  My mom said that this is the best spaghetti she has ever eaten. It's actually better the second day.  I use mild Italian sausage and add minced garlic and onions to the meat. I  mix in a bit of  Italian seasoning and grated parmesan to the cheese mixture. I skip the butter and cover with foil for 30 minutes,  add the cheese and then bake for another 15 minutes.

This recipe is great and we use it often. My suggestions: it DOES NOT need all that butter. I reduce butter by half, sometimes more, and it is just as good. Also, it is key to use cheddar cheese in this recipe, as stated. I was skeptical with it being a spaghetti recipe. However, the cheddar cheese really changes the flavor and is critical to the recipe. finally, if you find the creamy mixture too bland, add some garlic and/or Italian seasonings. Overall delicious!

I tried this a second time because I've had it when someone else made it and really like it. 
The second time I paid better attention to the recipe and it called for an 8 once box of noodles not 16. The typical box is a pound so when I made it the first time it was dry because I used twice the noodles. 
Also, I always cook my beef in onions and add garlic and seasoning. 
It was good.

I made SO many modifications... I added 3 tbs. of dried italian seasonings to the sour cream mixture to give it flavor and I used a larger jar of spaghetti sauce. Also, I didn't use cheddar cheese, I used shredded parmesan cheese (cheddar cheese on spaghetti didn't make sense to me from the beginning!) and it was great. I had this dish at a friend's house and they gave me the recipe so I knew what modifications I would make when I cooked it for my family. With these modifications, I would give it a 5 stars - also, spray a large piece of foil and put on top of the dish while it's baking to keep it from drying out, remove before adding the parmesan cheese and then pop it back into the oven to bake the cheese, about 10-12 minutes. And as always, it's better the next day. USE SMALL CURD COTTAGE CHEESE!!! :)

I added chopped onion, green pepper, and sliced mushrooms. Even so, except for the overwhelmingly too much butter, it was a little bland. Worstershire or cayenne would help, as would more tomato sauce, maybe another half-jar. Like most casseroles, it's better the next day.

My husband and I love million dollar spaghetti! Like other reviewers, I made some changes to get it to where I love it tho. First, like others, I cut the amount of butter used in half. I also add ricotta in with the cheese mix and it makes all the difference! I use low fat versions of the cheeses just because there is so much in there, and neither I or my husband can tell the difference in the taste in the end. Because there is so much cheese mix, I do 12 oz of noodles instead of 8 and a jar and a half of sauce.  With the extra sauce, I do a layer of it with the cheese mix just to help make the bottom half less dry. I'm actually thinking of mixing the cheese and sauce together before spreading it next time. Sometimes I do shredded cheddar on top, but usually opt for mozzarella. Sometimes I omit the shredded cheese and just add a nice layer parmesan when it's all finished.

Side note... We actually use ronzoni gluten free thin spaghetti noodles with this recipe. We never do gluten free for anything but always do with this. They actually taste good and it allows us to enjoy the food without the super heaviness in the tummy after a heavy pasta.  With the extra noodles, there is also tons of leftovers!

Modified it by only using cream cheese and sour cream and I seasoned it with Italian herbs and garlic salt. I also increased the amount of sauce. It's a winner in my book well after I added my own touches

I made this for my guest and we all loved it!! I used a 1 lb box of elbow macaroni instead of spaghetti and added a 6oz can of tomato paste to the spaghetti sauce to make it thicker. I will definitely make it again! YUM!!

I love this recipe...I'm no chef and it's simple to understand and super easy to make.  I consider this a cheat meal and we have it on a holiday or birthday.  My young kids love it!  Substitutions I make: I use whole wheat spaghetti instead, organic no sugar added marinara, I don't add the butter at all and don't see why it's needed.  I spray the bottom of the casserole dish with Pam spray instead of butter and it doesn't stick at all.  I also use half the cream cheese, lowfat cottage cheese, lowfat sour cream and lowfat shredded cheese.  I think it's FULL of favor!  Super yummy!!!  Plus I freeze about half of it and save for the next week.

I didn't  change this recipe, because I believe reviews should be based  on the original recipe as written.
This dish wasn't "bad," but the flavors didn't really blend well. The butter (which I love) made it greasy, and the cream cheese (which I also love)  was overbearing. It was an odd combination of cheese flavors in  what I assume  is supposed to be an Italian dish, based on having pasta sauce. as the cover

It was a bit too creamy, but otherwise it was ok. It was very runny at first, but after cooling off, the liquid was absorbed. The thicker the sauce, the better it turned out. I will be halving the cream cheese next time. Not too bad for using leftover spaghetti!

My family really likes this!  Yes, as others did, I omitted the butter completely.  I used about 12 oz. of  Rotini noodles and also increased the cream cheese and cottage cheese, plus added garlic, finely chopped Scallions (green onions) and some Italian seasoning to the cream cheese mix.  I also increased the spaghetti sauce amount.  Serve with garlic bread and a tossed green salad.  Really Good!

This is a yummy recipe and a big hit with my family and friends.  I have made it following the recipe to a t and found that once you taste the sauce and cheeses and get to the noodles your taste buds kinda go "huh?"  So much flavor on top to end up disappointed with bland noodles on the bottom. 

I found that rather than layering the butter I could add it to the noodles along with some garlic and basil for flavor to compliment the meat sauce and cheeses and it really brought this dish home.

I also add more sauce to the meat to keep the dish moist and double the recipe, it freezes well and is just as good as leftovers.  It helps to not completely cook the noodles, just a tad undone so they don't get gooey as they bake. 

Note: this is not the dish you want to make often if you are trying to lose or maintain your current weight.

I made it exactly by the recipe except that the smallest jar of pasta sauce I found was 24 oz and I used it all.  Everyone liked it.  I probably will add a little garlic and seasoning to the creamy cheese layer next time.  I noticed other reviews saying the cheese layer was bland or the pasta was dry.  Scoop it up, mix it up on your plate, the components are not meant to be eaten separately.

Did not care for the dense spaghetti (with no taste).  IF I were to make it again I would mix the layers together. Very disappointed with the end result.

I made some changes to cut down on the calories--saving 200+ calories per SERVING--and my husband and I thought it was great. I skipped the butter altogether and just sprayed the dish with cooking spray. I see no reason to use butter in this recipe. I used ground turkey instead of beef, fat-free cottage cheese, lite sour cream, and reduced-fat cream cheese. I also used half of the shredded cheese on top. The recipe makes a lot and will be perfect for leftovers. My toddler also really enjoyed it!

This is delicious!  I cut the butter in half and then doubled the noodles, and I’m so happy I did!  It was almost more like a lasagna with the extra noodles and my family loved it!  Next time we’ll try mozzarella cheese for fun, and add green olives and a squirt of Italian dressing to the meat sauce (which is how we make regular lasagna).  Totally give this a try!

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes!!  I have one in the freezer right now for potlucks, family gatherings, etc.  This is always a hit.  I first got this recipe off of Pintrest and have made it lots of times.  In my opinion, the brand of spaghetti sauce determines the flavor of this recipe.  I always use Rao Marinara Sauce and it gives this dish such wonderful flavor.  Also I add chopped fresh basil and/or any other fresh herb I might decide to add to the cheese mixture for added flavor.    This definitely a 5 star (and more!!) recipe!  Added bonus:  Freezes well!!!

I did tamper with this recipe! Used ricotta instead of cottage cheese  and crumbled Italian sausage instead of ground beef. Snuck in a layer of sliced canned artichoke hearts and added some sautéed minced garlic and onions as well as some coarsely chopped ‘shrooms to the sauce. I think it would also be good with chopped spinach instead of artichokes and/or some sliced black olives. This is a great recipe to play with!

Turned this into Multi-Million Dollar Spaghetti by adding 1 lb. of hot italian sausage to the ground beef and using ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. My guests raved about it and went back for third helpings!

I shared with 4 others when I first made it, and they all wanted the recipe.  Be sure to let it rest until just warm enough to eat.  Freezes well too, without affecting texture or taste.  By far the best spaghetti yet!

After reading other reviews, I only used 3 tablespoons butter.  I also added garlic powder and Italian seasoning to the cheese mixture.  We really enjoyed.  I will add more sauce when heating up for leftovers.

JJ Said WOW, this is the best spaghetti I've ever had in my life! I have to agree. I usually don't like Italian dishes, except for pizza every now and then ,but this recipe is fabulous. While I was putting it together ( made it exactly as written) I thought this is going to be pretty bland tasting, I used the cheapest store brand spag. sauce, with no added flavor., and store brand spag. noodles. This was very flavorful and I especially liked the textures. The only bad thing tonight is JJ and I didn't have anyone to share this with, but don't worry, I will be making this again soon. Jj won't let me forget this recipe! Thank you to Coqui30 For our fabulous meal, and thanks for sharing.

I added chopped onion and garlic powder to the ground beef while it was browning. I substituted mozzarella for the cheddar and added oregano, basil and more garlic powder to the cheese mixture. We really liked it and will make again.

Made it exactly as recipe noted. WAY too much butter! I realize this isn't supposed to fall under the "healthy for you" recipe list but, seriously, you could use 1/4 of the butter and it would be OK. But for flavor and texture, this was a big disappointment. The cheese mixture is flat and offers some creaminess, but with the weak flavors in store-bought pasta sauce, it just didn't work. If you do attempt this recipe, chop up some carrots and throw them in, add some fresh tomatoes, and find a pasta sauce that is bold and maybe even has some spice. This is not a "million-dollar" spaghetti.

It’s a keeper! My husband loved it! However, it’s a large amount and rich, so next time I will cut the recipe in half. I may also cover it with foil during the first 30 minutes of baking to keep it moist.

Great but no need for butter, just grease the baking dish. Make more sauce than you think you need, you can always use it for something else. Also momma always taught us to chop one bunch of green onions (green only) and mix with cheese mixture. Makes it super yummy! And no chedder, just a ton of parm. Just a good old southern standby recipe.

This recipe is kinda bland when made as is. It was delicious and would receive 5 stars if made with these changes... add a package of spaghetti seasoning to the ground beef, add a tablespoon of Italian seasoning and a teaspoon of minced garlic to cheese mixture, and layer noodles, cheese mixture, and sauce twice instead of once.

This was so good.  I did modify it to make it a little less heart stopping.  I used ground turkey, whole wheat noodles and low-fat cheeses with low-fat sour cream.  Even with those modifications this was very yummy and everyone in my family loved it.

I love this BUT I made a lot of changes.  I use spaghetti squash instead of noodles. I use about 1.5# of ground beef or a mixture of beef and sausage of o have it. I add onions and fresh garlic. I also toss my Spaghetti squash I'm the butter instead of putting pads of butter in it. I use 1 and a half jars of spaghetti sauce and top with Italian shredded cheese and sprinkle with Italian seasoning then bake. This is a favorite, but we had to make lots of substitutions to get it to our liking

I did not use the cottage cheese. That brought back bad memories of Jr. High school cafeteria lasagna. I spent a few extra coin and bought ricotta cheese. The spaghetti was a good idea.

LOVE THIS SO MUCH! Super unhealthy, but Oh. So. Good! I use 16oz of shredded cheddar because there just isn't quiet enough cheese already in this recipe. I also use about a jar and a half of pasta sauce.

I've made this twice and its absolutely delicious.  The 1st time I made it exactly as the recipe called and it was great as is.  the second time I added ground Italian sausage and an Italian cheese blend.  I layered it like lasagna and its equally as good as good.  Its my favorite baked spaghetti dish.

ABSOLUTELY THE BEST SPAGHETTI I HAVE HAD AND MADE.
THE CREAM CHEESE IS WHAT I FEEL MAKES IT EXCEPTIONAL.
MILLION DOLLAR CAUGHT MY EYE AND I AGREE THAT IT IS JUST THAT. JOMAMA

It was, ok but could use a bit more flavor. I'm going to try it again though, but leave out the butter, decrease cream cheese, use different noodles add more meat and sauce and maybe some Italian seasoning.

Delicious and a big hit for lunch. I read some of the reviews before I made it and decided to use mild Italian sausage rather than plain ground beef. Also totally omitted the butter.  I will definitely make this again.

I made no changes, but one jar of spaghetti sauce is not enough for a pound of spaghetti.  It didn't say what size jar and it was too dry.  Needed more sauce.  Tasted good, but very dry.  Probably won't make it again.

Very good but next time I'll add some chopped sundried tomatoes and extra spaghetti sauce, maybe reduce the cream cheese mixture as it was pretty rich.  It was good and I will make it again but I'll definitely add the sundried tomatoes for some zing.

I will definitely make this again, though I may put less cream cheese next time around or more sauce. It had a very creamy center.

This was interesting- it’s kind of like a lazy lasagna except instead of lasagna noodles, it’s spaghetti,  and instead of the filling  being made with ricotta It uses cream cheese, sour cream and cottage cheese instead! I did see an alternative recipe that used the ricotta cheese,  but I wanted  to try this recipe. The cream cheese made it a little bit sweeter than a lasagna I think, and my fam said it was really good, so It was a hit! 
 
I didn’t use as much butter As the recipe called for though, it was way too much IMO, So I only use  about half,  Which is still quite a bit!  

 This would be great to bring to a pot-luck type event, because  you can feed a lot of people with this, and  it’s very filling- after two bites I was stuffed!

I followed other reviewers’ suggestions of using less cream cheese, more cottage cheese, and more sauce.   My only use of butter was to melt some butter on the bottom of the casserole pan.  Everyone's general consensus was this dish is perfect comfort food and they requested to have it again.

My family (that doesn't like spaghetti) loved this. I did change a few things after reading some of the reviews. i made my own spaghetti sauce and added oregano, basil, parsley, thyme, onion and garlic to the sauce. I used the whipped cream cheese with chives and onion. and added 1/4 cup of ricotta cheese the mixture. I also used mozzarella instead of cheddar cheese.  This is a keeper!

I did cut back on the butter on top since it was being smothered  in the meat/tomato sauce mixture.  Next time I make it I'm planning on adding diced tomatoes to the sauce mix, maybe some onion and garlic as well.

Was pretty good. I did make a few changes though. I doubled the spaghetti, added 1/4 c onions, 2 cloves garlic, 1/2 tsp kosher salt, and 1/2 tsp black pepper to hamburger. Would use close to double the sauce next time by adding the other half - full 16oz jar to the spaghetti noodles.

It was very tasty. I diced up an onion and fried it up with the beef. I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese And added some blue cheese crumbles to give it some extra flavor. I’m looking forward to making it again.

I added 1 tsp of italian seasoning and 2 cloves of minced garlic to the cheese mixture.  I also used italian sausage instead of ground beef.  My jar of spaghetti sauce was 24 ounces and that was the perfect amount.  Delicious!

I made the recipe even simpler by mixing everything together,  starting with the meat/cheese mixture. I mixed the sauce with the cooked noodles then combined everything. I omitted the butter and just used Pam spray. I reserved a few spoonfuls of  sauce for the top just so any noodles sticking up at the surface didn't get hard during baking.  Covered it and baked. It turned out excellent and my husband said this recipe is a keeper.

Great comfort food! Very easy to do.  I used an Italian sausage, peppers and onion spaghetti sauce by Classico to add some flavour and pizzazz.  A new family favourite!

Followed some suggested changes such as adding more seasoning and using more tomato sauce. Also subbed ricotta for the cottage cheese. Really very loosey goosey on measuring but it turned out great - teenager, her dad and I all enjoyed it and we’re each picky in our own way. Covered for first 30 min. Broiled a couple minutes at the end to brown the cheese just a smidge.

My family really enjoyed this, however, we needed to make more sauce as it was a bit dry for us. I will definitely make it again, but next time I will definitely make more sauce mix and layer it throughout rather than just on top.

I’ve been making this for years. I season the cheese mixture and add more sauce otherwise it’s pretty dry.

I made everything the way the recipe was written. I would make it again however, my husbands only request was for the meat sauce to have another layer in the middle. So next time I will make that change and see how it works. And I love the cheese mixture.

My family loved this. Of course made some changes. I used zucchini noodles. I pat dried them real good. Did not precook. I mixed hamburger,  sausage, and onion together cooked. Omitted the cottage cheese. Mixed 8oz sour cream and 8oz cream cheese.  I omitted the butter. Used a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of pan instead of butter. I then layered noodle, cheese, meat 3 times. Cooked 30 mins. then put cheddar cheese on. Cooked 15 more mins.

I did make some changes. I didn't use butter.  I have an Adams seasoning of White Wine and Butter that I used.  I did spice up my sour cream, cream cheese light and cottage cheese mixture with pepper, garlic salt, lemon pepper.  Added those same spices to my meat mixture.  It was very good.  Next time I might use less cream cheese or just substitute those 3 ingredients for something lighter like 8oz of cottage cheese mixed with an egg to create a sort of lite ricotta.  I definetly didnt want to use Cheddar so I covered the top with grated parmesean.

My husband made this.  He said it was very easy to make and it was delicious. We will make it again but smaller quantity as there is only two of us. He did add a little more sauce and as he did not have the type of cheese it called for  he used shredded mexican cheese blend  I would send a picture but we ate it all.

Good, easy to make. Next time I'll add more onion and italian spices and be careful not to over-bake the cheddar cheese top layer. Bake too long and it's hard to get through and carries the beef/tomato layer off with it!

Really good. Left out the butter and just sprayed olive oil. My daughter and I felt that the cream cheese was too heavy so next time we’ll use half and replace it with cottage cheese.

This was fantastic!  I added a chopped medium yellow onion to my ground sirloin.  I also added about a tablespoon each of dried basil, oregano, and Italian seasoning.  I also added 6 minced garlic cloves.  I used a 24 oz. marinara sauce to give a little more tomato.  Everything else was as written.  It was great!

I made this last night and after reading the reviews and modifications, came away with this:
Just make your own spaghetti sauce, go to what you do best; I use 1 lb each of hamburger and Italian sausage, cooked with minced garlic and an entire onion.  Then I add my sauce and always add in lots more Italian seasoning and a bay leaf.  Let it cook as long as you can, simmering, (preferably the next day as it's always better).  I also used the rigatoni noodles since this is casserole style and just lightly sprayed the noodles with olive oil to keep them from sticking to the pan and each other. I used NO butter and didn't need it.  I did a layer of noodles, then the cream/cottage/sour cream mixture (I put garlic powder, salt and pepper in this) and then layered with the remaining noodles.  Then I covered all of it with sauce.  I did use the sharp cheddar and yes, it really did add a 'wow' factor.  Be generous with your sauce, it needs it.  I poked 'holes' through the cheese in the middle mixture to make sure the sauce make it through to the bottom noodles. It really was good, but be generous again with your seasonings and the sharp cheddar really brought some nice flavor.  I will definitely do this one again.

I made it per recipe, but substituted low fat cheese options. I did include the butter, which worked against the low fat cheese options, but my crowd likes butter.  Also used garbanzo bean spaghetti.   

Rave reviews.  Hubby said it was a keeper.

Not bad, but I would season it up more. Kind of  bland. Adding more ingredients,  such asgarlic, onions, peppers, maybe italian sausage, spices wouldmake it pop more!

I will add sausage, and more frest basil the next time. I used Ground Turkey instead of beef, added fresh basil and it was really good. Next time I will again use the turkey but I will add some sweet Itialian sausage to pump up the flavor a bit. Overall, easy to make and the family LOVED IT. Thank you.

Very good!!!  I made this according to our KETO diet. Boiled spicy sausage in water after removing cooked Cauliflour Lentil pasta (Cauliflour Foods).  Removed sausage casings when cooled & broke up into sauce I had previously made & frozen. Made it as directed-family loved it. Have a potluck Friday night & will take this using a jarred low-sugar spaghetti sauce. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I would never use cottage cheese in any Italian recipe or any other for that matter !! Italians do not use cottage cheese — I would substitute ricotta cheese for that or mascarpone .

I was cooking tomatoes down for sauce when I saw this so I used fresh cooked sauce with grilled hamburger onions and sweet peppers and a cajun lemon garlic  seasoning. My cheese blend was 32 oz ricotta with 8oz cream cheese and 1/2 cup sour cream which I divided into a 9 by 13 pan for original recipe and a 8 by 8 pan that I added 2 diced brats and a 1/2 cup sauteed  mushrooms  for the mushroom lovers in the family.  I also blended aged provolone cheese with the cheddar on top. Everyone loved the end products. I did use full amounts of butter but I cook with a lot normally so it didn't taste too heavy to us. I think you would have to have a strong flavored jar sauce to go with this without adding your "special blend" of seasonings but that is  what we all do to make it ours:)

I made it with modifications. First, I used rotin I noodles instead of spaghetti. Then I mixed half ground beef and half kielbasa sausage. I also seasoned my meat with Italian seasoning and a few other seasonings. And I topped it with half shredded cheddar and half Italian cheese blend. I cook this dish quite often and my family really love it!

I followed the general directions, just modified some ingredients. I used half the butter. Ground turkey instead of ground beef. No cream cheese (just used more of the cottage cheese and the called for sour cream). Instead of cheddar cheese, I opted for mozzarella on top and it turned out phenomenal!! I can see why it got its name :)

Made this for dinner and it was delicious! I doubled the recipe and made two pans so we would have some to freeze. I've made something similar before and it froze well. I will give this a try. 
This will be a dish we make regularly.

It came out nice. Great starter recipe. As is, it is bland. When cooking the ground beef, I started with chopped shallots, minced garlic, and onion in the pan then added my choice of seasoning blend as it cooked together. 

I, too, added italian seasoning to the cheese mixture. Without it it would have been pretty bad. I also agree that more sauce is needed. I had a 24oz jar of sauce on hand that I used, which was just enough to mix with one pound of cooked meat. 

Next time, I will use half the cream cheese, or skip it all together use only cottage and sub ricotta. I'll also mix it all together with the meat sauce.

to be fair I only used this recipe as a loose guide. I substituted lamb for the beef excluded the butter and substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese also instead of layering I just mix it all up it turned out great I'm adding it to the rotation

I made this last night for dinner and it was fairly well received by my EXTREMELY picky family! I loved it and anything that the whole family can eat is very rare in my clan and this was fairly simple to throw together. I did use rigatoni because that’s what I had on hand and mixed the “white sauce” in with the noodles. I usually have all the items on hand in this recipe so I will definitely make it again! Thank you for the recipe!

I've been making this dish for at least 35 years! But, I use Ricotta Cheese instead of cottage cheese. I don't use spaghetti noodles, I use egg noodles. I didn't know it was called Million Dollar Spaghetti, I've always called it Poor Mans Lasagna. It's a great dish.  I also don't use butter.

Turned out amazing with a few changes, one was suggested from Baking Nana. I also used less butter; While layering the pasta, I sprinkled a pinch of garlic salt and a pinch of Italian seasoning. Then I mixed the cream cheese mixture into the pasta instead of layering like a lasagna. For the topper, I used Havarti cheese and mixed cheddar/mozzarella and again sprinkled a pinch of Italian seasoning!

This was good!  After reading reviews, I added garlic and Italian seasoning to the cheese layer and used a mix of rigatoni and ziti because it's what I had. I used two smaller pans and froze one for later. It was great with the cheddar cheese instead of the more traditional mozzarella.

Subbed shredded mozzarella for the shredded cheddar cheese; added a handful of frozen chopped "seasoning blend" to hamburger while browning it; used a full 24-ounce jar of spaghetti sauce; used my Copper Chef XL casserole instead of a 9"x13" pan.  Baked up beautifully; held together better than my lasagna usually does;  with 3 of us eating this, we had just enough left over for lunch the next day.  This will be a permanent addition to my repertoire!

This dish turned out GREAT!  I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  I layered the meat mixture in two parts.  I sprinkled mozzarella cheese and mild cheddar cheese on both layers of the meat mixture.  I seasoned the cheese mixture with Italian Seasoning .   Will definitely make this again.....

We all loved it, and I'm making it again very soon! I added onion to the ground beef while cooking, and I only used 1/4 c. butter. This was the only online recipe I found for Million Dollar Spaghetti that called for only 8 oz. of spaghetti (instead of 16 oz). I think that makes a big difference!

Made this, but modified it.
We used no cottage cheese, and more sauce. Tasted pretty good!

My family absolutely loves this meal!! Definitely a family favorite!The perfect combo of pasta, spaghetti sauce, and cream cheese mixture! I season the spaghetti sauce to perfection (it makes a big difference). I never really use the butter on the bottom. And I added a little more spaghetti sauce than listed in the recipe.

This was GREAT! The only thing I did different was use vegan ground beef, and make my own sphagetti sauce. I also added more than 16oz of sauce to the sphagetti.  My family loved it and my 3 year old wanted seconds.

This was pretty yummy. I added some seasonings to the cheese mixture as some suggested and doubled the spaghetti sauce. Next time I will use 1/2 the cream cheese. I think my grandkids will love this dish.

Have this in the oven right now.  Can't wait to try it.  I didn't leave out the butter due to there being so many other dairy products. And I also used one small can of ?? sauce. .... Looks good!

This turned out to be a big hit with the family! I took suggestions from others to increase the sauce and decrease the butter and cream cheese mixture. I used a 24 oz can of spaghetti sauce which was just right. Then, I omitted half the butter by just using cooking spray on the bottom of the pan and only putting pats on top of the spaghetti. Lastly, I left out the cottage cheese and increased the sour cream to almost 1/2 cup. Still creamy and perfect! Definitely will make again!

My husband and I hate cottage cheese. So I replaced it with ricotta and it was delicious. But be warned the ricotta makes it rich maybe a little heavy for some.

This was pretty good! Used 1/2 lb Italian sausage and 1/2 lb of hamburger  (made a huge difference) and 24oz of Prego spaghetti sauce. The cheese mixture was a little rich, and I didn't use it all to begin with, so I'll use less than what I did next time. Oh, and I didn't use any butter. I just sprayed  the casserole dish generously with Pam spray.

I was looking for something different to cook.  This recipe is a winner in my household.  I followed the recipe as is, but found myself having to use  the whole jar of spaghetti sauce, and adding almost 2lbs of hamburger meat. With all that being said....overall I will cook it again for my family.  Sometimes eyeballing the expectation during the preparation phase allows for you to twirk the recipe for a great outcome....
Thanks for sharing something different. Looking forward to exploring another recipe.

I think this is a great base of a recipe to mold into what someone enjoys for themselves. I don't like sour cream so I only added a table spoon and added a good amount of ricotta. I also added parmesan and two eggs to my cheese mixture. On the bottom of the cooking pan I spread a tablespoon of butter. (Found that in another similar dish recipe and liked the addition.) Overall I wish I had cheddar cheese in the house because I think that makes the difference. I only had colby and jack. Next time will use cheddar and not so much spaghetti noodles. It turned out nice and creamy.

Very good, I made with rigatoni and I added green peppers. Season your ground beef so it is not bland. Used half of stick of butter and it turned out very well. This is definitely a keeper.

Okay, so I haven't tried it specifically how it states up above. Here a my modifications, which are flavor rich and delicious:

Instead of using cottage cheese, I used ricotta. I seasoned my meat with garlic salt and the noodles with garlic and celery salt. I think this is what really adds flavor for those who are missing some. I agree the butter wasn't necessary, so I only used a little bit--not even half. For the shredded cheese, I used a mix of mild cheddar and a six cheese Italian blend. I don't think I used a whole eight ounces; I just sprinkled an even layer of both on top. Bake until cheese is bubbly!

And not that it really matters (just personal taste), but I used wheat noodles and substituted greek yogurt for sour cream, just because that's what I had on hand.  And it stood the true test: my children!

I made this with spaghetti squash for a healthier option and we love it.
