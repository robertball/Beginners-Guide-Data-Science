Yum! Perfect to satisfy my craving of molasses cookies since having one at a local bakery this morning, and it tasted just as good!

I did use 1/2 cup butter instead of 3/4 cup shortening which I didn't have but don't like any way, 2 eggs instead of 1 to keep the soft texture, 1/2 tsp. of salt instead of the full tsp. as previously recommended, and baked them for 8 minutes on an air bake cookie sheet and they were perfectly soft and chewy - ten minutes after they came out not a single one is left.

My family and I love these cookies! But each time, we've found them too salty, so I'd strongly recommend cutting the salt in half. Also, be careful not to overbake as they turn hard. Underbake them just slightly. As they cool, they will harden slightly and still be nice 'n' soft 'n' chewy. A lovely cookie apart from the excessive salt (which can be corrected).

If you've ever had one of Starbuck's moist molasses cookies to compliment your mocha, this recipe is as close as you're going to get.

Absolutely Divine.  I will never use a different recipe for this particular cookie.  I used dark molasses.  Had to make a DOUBLE batch.

I gave this a 4 only because I never have made molasses cookies before and have nothing to compare it to. This was a very easy recipe and will most likely use it again. I did cut the salt down to half a tsp but will not the next time I think I could have used the whole amount and it would not have been too salty. If this is your first time making these don't attempt to flatten them down when they are baking they will flatten as they cool

So far these have been the best I've made so far. I used butter instead of the shortening and I accidentally  left out the salt.  Very pleased with the out come though.

Great cookie!  I also halved the salt and ended up using dark brown sugar as i bought that by mistake...definitely a mistake worth making!  Gave it a bit deeper molasses flavor.  These keep very well and are still soft and chewy several days later.

This is the best cookie I have ever tasted in my life and I have ate a lot of cookies.  I only had about 1/3 of a cup of molasses so I had to add honey to it to make up the difference.  After I rolled them into balls I rolled them in some "RAW" sugar and frozen them. WOW!  I will make these cookies again.

These cookies were really good.  I like how spicy they were.  I rolled my first batch in sugar but because I have crappy pans the sugar burned a little bit.  I didn't roll the other batches in sugar and they seemed to come out a little better.  I recommend Silpat matt or parchment paper.  But they are very tasty indeed...

I have made these about three times now and the recipe is simple, easy, and turns out great every time! I love the flavor. They are also a very pretty cookie with the sugar dusting. They keep moist and store well for a good, long time. They also freeze decently. I added a dash of nutmeg for extra Autumn flavor.

Ginger snaps have always been a favorite in our house, but after making this Molasses cookie, I don't think we will ever go back.  The only change i made after the first time baking these was less salt.  I decreased it by 1/2  tsp.

Amazing! I have made these for years now and every time I get huge compliments. Everyone thinks they look and taste like high-end store bought cookies. Usually I omit the cloves. I also substitute 1/2 the sugar for brown sugar and use a generous 1/2 cup of dark molasses, not light. But I've made them directly as-is and they are wonderful too. 

Overall, a great cookie! Family, co-workers, friends all love them!

I've tried several molasses sugar cookie recipes from this site, and other places, and this is exactly the one I was looking for.  They stay soft and don't spread out too much.  My only complaint...they don't last long enough in my house and I always have to make more!  Thanks for sharing.

I am not a fan of molasses so I didn't really care for these.  I will give them 5 stars based on the reaction I got from the friends and family I gave them to.  I followed the recipe exactly with the except I reduced the salt in half.

They look gorgeous. But i hate to rate these so low. I accidently added the remaining sugar to the dough, which I am thankful I did in the end result because these cookies have a spicy kick. I baked 9 rolled in sugar and 9 with sugar sprinkled on top. The sugar helps in toning down the flavor. They taste great when you put them in your mouth but leaves a strange after taste (must be the ginger). Gets 5 stars for being easy to make but 3 for flavor. Might make again with less salt and ginger.

This is by far my most favorite recipe.  It tastes like the cookies that you find at Starbucks.  I followed the variations mentioned before by substituting shortening for 1/2 cup butter, 1 egg for 2 and they turned out so good.

Delicious!  Chewy on the outside, soft and fluffy in the middle.  The best molasses cookies I've had!  (I did reduce the salt to about 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon).

This is a great recipe I've used many many times now. I use salted butter instead of shortening and 1/2 the salt (1/2 tsp). So yummy.

These were great!!  I usually don't like spicey type cookies, but these were excellent and had hubby and kids begging for more!  I didn't chill the dough, it was easy to handle, and they turned out fine.  Using butter flavored shortening adds flavour.  I disagree with the reviewers that complained the cookies were too salty, for us the salt complimented the cookie's sweetness and spices.  A keeper recipe, thanks!

I have looked forever for this molasses cookie! Spicy, chewy, but crisp on outside~ yum!  I made some changes though: creamed 1/2 c. Smart balance spread, melted, 3/4 c brown sugar, molasses, 1-2 tsp. Vanilla, 2 tbls. light vanilla yogurt-- dry ingredients- used 1/2 tsp. salt- scant 2 1/2 cups organic unbleached flour-- combine and at the end add in 2 tbls. of boiling water, blend in w/beaters- chill dough, scoop, sugar-coat & baked for 9-10 min.  THANKS SO MUCH FOR THIS!

These were really good and really easy to make, however they were a tad salty. Next time I will use less salt then the recipe calls for. I also didnt have light molasses and used full strength black strap molasses, they tasted really good and had lots of flavor.

The best cookies ever hands down! Great for those with a nut allergy! I made these cookies many times over the recent Christmas holiday; I made them for my daughter's preschool class, for a family get-together, for my husband's work and as a ''thank you'' for a neighbor who helped me with something. Thank you Jan!

Have made this recipe the past 3-4 years as part of my Christmas baking and absolutely love it!  It has just the right amount of spice.  The only thing that I do differently is roll the dough in raw sugar instead of white...gives a much better tasting crust and compliments the molasses really well.

I loved these! I ended up unintentionally altering part of it. I didn't have light molasses, and didn't have shortening. instead I used regular molasses, and butter (since I used butter, I also cut out the salt) my Husband found the dough pretty sweet, so I skipped rolling them in sugar, and just dusted with powdered sugar. Delicious!

I tried these at Christmas last year, using dark brown sugar and dark molasses (that was what I had on hand).  I made only a small batch, thinking that they would be too strong for the kids.  WRONG!  They were devoured first.  Will make more this year!

I think they are too salty with 1 teaspoon of salt. Next time I will use much less. Every thing else was perfect! I will make again w/ that one adjustment.

Love them but found that baking them 8.5 -9 min was perfect. 10 minutes would almost burn them.

These are great cookies. Following all the suggestions: I used butter (3/4 c), added an egg, and halved the salt. The aftertaste Pchotrani is talking about is the cloves. I tasted it too. Maybe next time I'll try allspice or nutmeg (nutmeg doesn't smell right in combination with the cinnamon and ginger but I'll see what I get). I checked other molasses cookies and the spice ranged from these three, Cin. Gin. and Nut, Cin. Gin. and All, and even Cin. Gin. Cream of Tartar... We'll see... I baked them 9 1/2 minutes and they are perfect! Thank you.

mine were not nearly as crackly as the picture, but i made them very small with a melon baller. I also rolled in sugar before baking. I think next time I will add a little more spice. Maybe my spices aren't as fresh. A super cookie to have with tea or coffee. And so easy. I cooked on parchment so didn't even have to grease the pans. Very good and easy to store in a plastic container.

My Grandmother & I made these cookies yesterday and instantly fell in love with this soft, full-flavored cookie!  We doubled the batch with the exception of the baking soda as others recommended.  The only changes we made was to substitute unsalted butter for the shortening and we used 1/2 dark, full-flavor molasses and 1/2 black strap molasses (only because we didn't have enough of either kind to use just one).  We rolled them into balls but did not flatten with a glass as others recommended and they cracked beautifully.  Believe me when I tell you that these cookies looked like they came from a bakery and the flavor is what Archway's molasses cookies used to taste like!

This recipe worked perfectly as written and made delicious moist cookies. I tried a batch with half the salt and found that they didn't all rise enough and some seemed to deflate but even then they were very tasty. I will use the original amount of salt from now on. You can taste the salt but I'd say it compliments the other flavors well. Rolling the dough into firmly packed small balls (about 1" diameter) makes small round cookies just like the picture. I baked them for 10 minutes excatly and they were perfectly cooked. I tried 9 minutes and some were under-cooked.

My family loved these cookies.  My son-in-law thought I bought them at a local bakery!  I did make a few changes: I used 3/4 cup unsalted, softened butter, Blackstrap molasses for stronger flavor and reduced salt to 1/2 t.  I used dark brown sugar.  I added a little more of the spices as well.  Yummy!!

I used the dark molasses for a richer flavor but everything else the same as in the recipe.  They turned out chewy and absoloutley delicious.  Even my mother who is not fond of Molasses cookies, couldn't keep her fingers out of the cookie jar!  YUM!

Great recipe -- I followed the other reviewer's lead & cut the salt to 1/2 t.  I also used 1/2 c. Splenda brown sugar instead of the full cup.  Marvelous!

This is so easy, but a wonderfully soft cookie my husband wants me to market! Thanks for this receipe.  There's nothing I would change about.  The dough keeps well in the refrigerator, by the way, to make cookies all week long. They're wonderful warm.

Just made these.  Pretty good.  I was looking for a cookie that tastes like Tim Horton's Ginger Molasses cookies.  This came pretty close.  I must say DO NOT OVERBAKE.  Your cookies will turn hard very quickly if left for even a minute too long.  I cooked them at 325 for 9 min on top oven wrack.  They had the perfect amounts of spices.  Texture was perfect.  Not only did they taste good but they look perfect too.  Perfectly round when done, nice colour.  And yes, soft and chewy in the middle.  I stored them in a container.

Fabulous! I just whipped these up with some left-over ingredients I had around. Didn´t have shortening or even butter, so I used olive oil. Didn´t refrigerate. Despite all those changes, they turned out beautifully.

These were absolutely delicous. I recently made them for my family. I took some of the other reviews to heart and doubled the spices and used butter instead of shortening. Next time I think I might add a touch of cayanne pepper too. Thanks for sharing this treasure!

Excellent cookies.  I cut the salt in half and used coconut oil (which solidifies) in place of the shortening.  I also didn't chill the dough as I was in in a hurry.  They turned out perfect at 9 minutes!

These are definitely pretty good... but something is off, and I can't figure out what. I used dark ("robust") molasses and light brown sugar, since that was what I had... and they almost taste... too molasses-y? So, in retrospect, I probably should have used light molasses, and perhaps increased the cinnamon, for a more mainstream flavor.

I added the 2 eggs and reduced the salt, used butter instead of shortening, doubled the recipe and heaped my spices and these cookies were AHHH-MAZING! Our oven bakes/cooks slightly hotter so I reduced the heat to 325 and cooked for 14 min and they are perfectly cracked and puffy and chewy at the same time!!! 5 stars all around. I may even double the spices next time- I like mine a little more spicy!:)

great flavor. used butter instead of shortening. they came out a little flat when I made them bite size. Tried again another day and used the ice cream scoop. They were perfect! Big and crackled on top.

I don't know if it is possible to mess this up! I meant to do 1/2 batch, but only remembered to measure the shortening as half, and the rest normal (to much on my mind!), but they still turned out great! They were beautiful, soft little cookies that would look great in a cookie jar.

I gave this recipe four stars only because I myself am not a huge fan of molasses cookies. These ones were the best ones I've had so far, though. I'm fifteen, and my older sister had a party at her house, so I decided to make these to bring. Everyone seemed to like them a lot (especially my mother), so I'll definitely keep this recipe.

These are great.  Perfect with coffee.  They are just like the ones I bought at an amish produce store in south central PA.  Didn't change a thing except that I had dark molasses on hand instead of light.  Came out wonderful.  It's a keeper!

i really liked these cookies i made them once before and i thought they were very salty so i strongly advise u to split the salt in half and when u bake them slightly push ur pointer finger in the middle of the cookie so that it will spread out and sometimes i like to put a little sprinkles in the middle of that indent for some color (do that before u bake the cookies)

Awesome recipe. Couple changes, I used 2 eggs instead of 1, I also added 1/3 cup of honey and went a little heavy on the spices. They were great, getting eaten as fast as I could make them. Also baked for 8 minutes so they were chewy. Definately making again.

These cookies really are delicious and soft and practically perfect in every way. Except that they are extremely SALTY! I would strongly recommend that you reduce the salt to 1/4 teaspoon.

As a result of all the other complaints of saltiness in the reviews, I opted to
cut the salt to 1/2 a tsp. Also the bake time was not sufficient. They weren't soft and chewy after 11 mins, they were still raw in the middle. So, the second 
batch we made the balls no bigger than melon-baller size and increased bake time to 12-14 mins. They turned out a bit
crunchier and the shape was perfectly round. Like they were factory made. The
taste was outta this world. A HUGE hit with my kids and the neighbors kids and my niece who was visiting. I've even had to translate this recipe into Arabic for my neighbors who also gave it 2 thumbs up! (We live in Egypt!)
EXCELLENT recipe.

Delicious.  Baked as directed except used white whole wheat floud instead of all-purpose....still came out great!  Very soft and chewy.  Also added a bit more sugar on top after they came out.

Do not make this recipe! I was not happy with the results.  It needs at least a cup of molasses and an addition cup of sugar if I was even going to attempt eating it.

These are delicious! My brown sugar was dry as dust so I substituted 1 cup of granulated sugar and reduced the flour by 1/2 a cup. These still turned out perfect and I will definitely use this recipe again.

I was always known for my molasses cookies. Unfortunately I have moved 5 times in the last 6 years and lost my original recipe so I decided to give this a try. Not only was this as good, I felt it was better! In my original recipe, the cookies turned crunchy. In this recipe the cookie remains soft. I haven’t baked cookies since 2005 so my family was quite surprised to receive a plate of cookies this Christmas and once again they loved the molasses cookies the most!

My favorite cookie recipe. Closest thing to my favorite Starbucks cookie. I used dark molasses and rolled them in raw sugar crystals to make them look more festive. Very easy to make and give off a wonderful fragrance while baking.

These were delicious. In recommend 1/2 to 2/3 the recommended salt and perhaps half the cloves for those who don't like super strong spices.

I've been making this recipe for 25+ years. It was given to me by a very good friend who has since passed away.  she gave me the actual page she ripped out of Southern Living. I was devistated it had disappeared this year. It was stained and well used. I was relieved I found it in your archives.  Cookie night with the neighbor kids (all twenty something now with kids of their own) wouldn't have been the same!  Best Molasses cookie recipe ever!

I have gone crazy making cookies this year for Christmas and this was one of my new ones to try. Very good cookies. Only thing I changed was I only used 1/4 t of salt since the recipe on the back of the molasses was similar and called for that amount. Also to make them crack I sprinkled them very lightly with a few drops of water before baking. I am keeping this one.

I made these for my grandchildren.  The only change I made was to use  1/4 cup applesauce instead of the egg because one grandson has egg and dairy allergies. They are easy and delicious!  This is my go-to recipe for molasses cookies.

I absolutely loved this recipe its a really quick and easy treat to make and the amount it makes with all the little bite sized cookies is perfect.

The only change I made to this recipes was adding a couple extra spices. I added half teaspoon all spice as wells a half teaspoon of ground nutmeg!

My family loves these cookies.  We all like molasses so I use dark molasses in this recipe.  I also use butter and skip the salt.  My Dad loves them hot and fresh, so I mix them up roll in sugar and freeze for him to take home to bake.  He checks my freezer now and swipes them.  Lol

Very good flavor.  Just be careful of the cooking time and make sure you have a wire rack for cooling.  Molasses cookies continue to bake after they are removed from the oven!

The recipe was easy, just as advertised. I added a little extra ginger because I wanted to have a spicy cookie to counter all of the holiday sweets. Great recipe. Will be saving to use again.

I used 1/2 cup unsalted butter instead of shortening as others suggested and 1/2 the salt.  I made one dozen and they were a bit bland.  Left the batter covered in fridge overnight and that helped the flavor.  They weren't bad but  I've had better so 4 stars.

Nice consistency. However there is an aftertaste of baking soda. Looked at my old stand by recipe and sure enough it had half of the baking soda in the recipe.

Easy and yummy! I recommend air bake cookie sheets or placing them near the top of the oven when baking.  A hair less salt and the recipe is perfect! We doubled it.

These were the perfect molasses cookie for my hubby and I. I made a few changes though that another reviewer suggested: I used 2 eggs and did not bother to roll the dough balls in sugar. I would recommend rolling the dough into balls first before chilling, because when you do, the dough gets warm and sticky (probably because I used an extra egg).

This was an easy, simple recipe to follow and do. I cooked these cookies for my husband and father, who both love molasses cookies. They are especially delicious when they first come out of the oven and are warm. Will definitely make these again! The dough also freezes very well.

Very good, soft molasses cookies when baked for 8 minutes in my oven.  I did add more ginger and 1/2 teaspoon allspice.  The dough was VERY soft and these really didn't puff up much at all, though they did wind up with the cracks somehow.  Next time, I think I'll add an extra egg and a bit more flour.
UPDATE:  I added the extra egg and just 1/4 cup more flour.  Wound up with rounded cookies, softer and more cake-like than chewy.  My husband likes 'em.  I also used 1-1/2 T ginger and added 1/2 t allspice to the mix, and used blackstrap molasses.  They didn't come out very sweet at all, but a nice munch.

I subbed butter for the shortening and they worked fine. Taste was very good for a cookie that doesn't include chocolate. Very easy to make; I stuck the dough in the freezer for about 5 minutes rather than 1-2h in the fridge & it worked out fine.

So, I LOVE molasses cookies, and so I tried a recipe (not this one) that said to bake the cookies for 15 mins at 350 degrees. I did this and they were completely burnt. Horrible. I felt so bad about myself after making them thinking that I was the worst cook ever! Anyway, so then I decided to make these cookies... and I listened to one of the reviewers comments that said to use 2 eggs instead of shortening and that the extra egg (instead of using only one) makes them fluffier. I also use light molasses instead of dark/robust. I did NOT like this recipe! The eggs made them MUCH too fluffy (molasses cookies are supposed to be chewy, not fluffy) and the light molasses made them flavorless. I then got a recipe from my friend who makes the BEST molasses cookies EVER and they turned out PERFECTLY. Use shortening (and take the shortening and put it in a sauce pan and melt it completely and then let it cool.. once it cools mix it with the ingredients like the recipe says) and dark molasses. Bake them at 375 for 7 mins. They will be PERFECT!

Utterly delicious! Fast and easy. I didn't have as much molasses as I thought I did - only a quarter cup - and had to add a bit more brown sugar, and they still came out great.

i tried these out and was so excited because someone said they were really close to the ones you get from Starbucks but I'm no sure what happened because they deflated a lot and I didn't change the b.soda quantity at all. Anyone have any suggestions?

These cookies were really good.  I used dark molasses instead of light, because I like a richer flavor, and they turned out great.  The recipe says that it yields 18 cookies, but I rolled them into about 1" balls (which made very normal-sized cookies) and I ended up with 2 dozen.  Rolled them before baking in raw sugar mixed with red & green colored sugar (for the holidays) and they turned out beautiful, with all the right crinkles.  Baked for exactly 10 min. and they were nice and chewy.  After resting for a day, I think they taste even better the next day. Also, I am a big believer that butter generally tastes better than shortening in cookies, but I tried the shortening, and they were perfect!

Mmm mmm! I just made these cookies and they are so moist and chewy!  I cut the salt in half like others said to do.  Even my teenage daughter went crazy for these and she was turning her nose up at them while I was making them.  The whole house smells like gingerbread.  Excellent recipie!

I substituted salted butter for the shortening, and used dark molasses instead of the light. I eliminated the salt entirely, as the butter had plenty. They are a wonderful ginger bread-like cookie.Great with hot tea or coffee.

These are very very good. Very quick and easy to make. I didn't bother to chill as they were easy to handle right away. The only change was using less salt as recommended. This recipe will be used over and over again.

I made this for a group of friends last night and received mixed reviews.  Most people thought it was good but that I should keep looking for a better recipes.

Bear in mind that I didn't have any brown sugar and had to substitute white sugar instead, however, I was using dark molasses.

I'm going to keep looking for a better recipe.

Very good, chewy cookies.  I like to use butter-flavored shortening.  These stay soft for a few days.

great texture and look, but the flavor wasnt the intense molasses/ginger I was expecting (bland actually) and a bit salty. Maybe due to the amount of salt (about 2x the amount I am used to). Very disappointed as I made a double batch and wont make again.

My husband's favorite cookie! And this recipe is a hit! Fast and easy! I used a larger-sized Pampered Chef cookie scoop and had cookies in no-time. Thank you!

"They are really yummy."  That is what my daughter thought about these cookies.  She was also the one that made the cookies.  Simple and good.
