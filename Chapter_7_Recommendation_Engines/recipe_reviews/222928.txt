This is a very good recipe.  Its easy to follow and easy to make.  Now, I do roast all my peppers and a glove of garlic on top of the suggested recipe.  

Remember when you are roasting: to take the pepper out of the oven then choke it in a Ziplock baggie.  Do that for a min or two, then you can literally scrape out any seeds and the charred outside.  You should scrape the outside because that burnt area is very bitter.  

I combine this recipe with a personal recipe for salsa.

Pretty good but recommend roasting everything and then puree with a diced avocado, the avocado is the key. Killer on everything but especially good on pork carnitas!

First time working with tomatillos.  I understood the directions to husk them but skipped the peeling as it seemed futile.  Otherwise followed directions and ingredient list.  Husband loved it and wants to hang on to this recipe.  Throwing everything into the food processor made it so easy. Recommend.

This salsa is tasty but a little too spicy for me even though I didn't use the Serrano pepper and used 2 jalapenos from some that I had canned. I also like my salsa a little thicker.  Next time I will probably only use one pepper and maybe only the juice from a smaller lime or just half of a large one so it's not so liquidity. It's worth the try if you're looking for a tasty Verde salsa.

I also roast everything except for the cilantro, along with 5-6 cloves of garlic. I've never added the sugar, and haven't noticed it missing. Tastes great on anything!

We can't get enough of this! I grew two big tomatillo plants in my garden this year, but I plan on growing 4 next year just to have plenty of tomatillos to make this salsa. This is very easy to make in a food processor. I used a little more cilantro and a little more onion. A half-teaspoon of salt is good too, but not necessary.

I like my salsa a little thicker, so I'd strain some of the liquid off of the roasted tomatillos. I usually add a bit of smoked salt, a clove or two of garlic and an extra hot pepper, which I sometimes roast along with the tomatillos. I usually mince the garlic and hot peppers ahead of putting them in the food processor so that no one gets a big hunk of it in a single bite.  I make it ahead so the flavours meld together.

Great recipe, delicious.  I only had a pound of tomatillos and instead of broiling them, I hate having to clean the broiler pan, I baked them whole in a casserole dish in a 350 degree F oven for 45 minutes until golden and a bit charred.  Sprayed them with Pam and sprinkled with salt and pepper prior to baking.  Also tossed in 2 cloves of garlic and 2 serrano chilies to the roasting pan.  Ended up using only 1 clove of garlic and 1 pepper when I blended and it was plenty hot.   Also added 1/2 tsp. of Kosher salt.  Got distracted for a moment while blending and ended up with a smoother result than what I was after (was making to dip tortilla chips) , but it didn't matter because it still tasted great.  Keep your eye on that blender if you want it a little chunky.  Even though I used a 1/2 pound fewer tomatillos than recipe called for, I didn't adjust anything else in the recipe.  Next time, I might add a 1/4 c. more onion, and maybe try it without doing any roasting.  Try this recipe.  You won't  be disappointed.  Did not use the jalapeno pepper as 1 pepper was plenty hot.

After eating the real taco with the green sauce in the Hispanic festival, I was in the hunt for the greatest green salsa in youtube and allrecipes. After 4 recipes, I quit on this one. The hunting is over, this is the one !!! The key is broil them. Thank you for the recipes !!!

Delicious is right!  FYI you only need to husk, not peel the toms. I did tweak a bit here n there but nothing outlandish.   (A bit of sea salt,  a little cumin, fresh ground coriander and clove of garlic.) The recipe is most likely awesome as written but  I like to adjust to my own personal pref.  Also, if you can make ahead, this will thicken up, almost gel like until you stir it up.
In any event...the roasting of toms is the BOMB diggity. (Why didn't I think of that?) This is now my 'go to'   I make enough for freeze for future use. Thanks for the inspiration you can play with if that's your thing.

Awesome Recipe.  Roasting of the Tomatillos added a nice almost smokey flavor.  I did feel like it needed salt so I added 1 tsp of salt and that helped it a lot.  I also tripled the amount of hot peppers.  With just 2 hot peppers there was barely any heat at all.

Seriously addictive!!! Like another reviewer, I roasted all vegetables except cilantro. This included the tomatillos, three different types of peppers from our bountiful basket, the whites of three spring onions, and three cloves of garlic. I didn't try to peel the tomatillos, but I did peel the charred peppers. Food processor made quick work of it. I had to use lemon, not lime, it was fine but I think the lime would be better. A night in the fridge, a little salt to taste, and I can't wait to make another batch!!!

The roasting of the tomatillos & simplicity of the ingredients makes this recipe! It's fairly spicy, so if you're sensitive, you can remove the seeds and veins of the jalapeno and it makes it a little more mild.
