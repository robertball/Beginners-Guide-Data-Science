This was very good. I only substituted the minute rice with cooked brown rice and it was delicious. My family all had seconds and there was no leftover.

Quick, easy and yummy!  I used my frozen cooked ground beef (had onion, garlic and green peppers in it) then heated it up and added the taco seasoning, and about 3 tablespoons tomato sauce because it seemed dry.  Then followed the directions from there.  Thanks for  sharing the recipe!

Delicious! I used 1/2 can corn and 1/2 can black beans, and rice that we already had cooked, plus I used a combination of cheddar and mozzarella. There's only three of us, so we had leftovers for lunch the next day. Thanks for the recipe!

I LOVE this recipe!!  I too wanted a good alternative to plain tacos and this is definitely it!  I made a few changes, including adding onions to the ground beef while cooking, I also added about a half cup of salsa and 2 spoonfulls of sourcream to the meat mixture before putting it in the tortillas.  I also used only half of the suggested corn amount out of personal preference. My fiance absolutely loved it and since it was just us two, there were lots of leftovers!

Nice alternative to regular taco's.  I used 3 cups of frozen corn (cooked & drained) instead of the canned. This cuts the sodium significantly. I also serve it with bowls of condiments: lettuce, diced tomato, chopped red or green onion, sour cream, salsa or pico de gallo, Mexican rice, refried or Borracho beans.  I also buy my pico de gallo and flour tortillas fresh off the grill from a local Mexican restaurant.  Yummy dinner that is liked by the whole family!

I've made these twice and they are DELICOUS! I absolutely love this recipe, definitely a keeper. My boyfriend loved them, and we had lots of leftovers. Like the poster before me, I also used frozen corn instead of canned to reduce sodium. I also replaced the ground beef with ground turkey to reduce fat. I've made them twice: the first time with uncooked instant white rice and the next time with some mexican rice I'd made the day before and both were delicious. Next time I may try to throw in some black beans and maybe some chopped onion-- like another posted suggested, there really is so much that you can add/change to this and it'll probably still work! Thank you for posting this =]

Delish! I used shredded chicken in place of the ground beef, instant brown rice, and subbed black beans for half of the corn.  I also used a little more taco seasoning than called for and mix half a can of enchilada sauce with half a jar of salsa for the topping.  Sprinkled with sliced green onions and topped with sour cream.  Excellent recipe that I will definitely be making again.

this was so easy to make.  i followed most of the recipe but added a few things.  instead of using corn i used a can of diced tomato and green pepper.  this gave it some kick. i sauteed diced onion in the hamburger.  when putting together the tacos i lined the inside with lowfat refried beans.  then put the filling in an rolled them up.  this was perfect the family loved it! thanks for sharing.

Very good recipe. Quick and easy. I had to adapt a bit due to ingredients on hand. Used 1 lb ground meat. 1 can corn and doubled the rice which was regular long cooked long grain rice. Upped cheese in mixture to 2 cups. 

I used Pace Picante sauce as well as that is all I had. I think that was the only thing I didn't like about the recipe. Not that it tasted anything but great but rather there was quite a bit of liquid in the bottom of the pan from the sauce and created a somewhat of a soggy texture on the bottom. 

Overall this was a VERY tasty dish that was so simple to put together. I will definitely make it again and probably add some black beans to the mix.

My family loved this recipe.  I made it as written except that I used regular white rice that was already cooked.  As we ate we discussed how versatile this recipe could be - we could add black beans, use brown rice, top with tomatoes, lettuce, olives, etc.   Thanks newmilitarymommy for  sharing this yummy recipe.

I Tried making this last week and it was DELICIOUS. I had plenty of leftovers that were just as good the second time around and even had company who was hungry rave about the leftovers (and finished them too)  I prepared the recipe as written with the only change being that i only had 4 tortilla on hand, so i stuffed them a little more, evenly using all the filling. I will definitely be making these again in the near future

Very easy and delicious! I substituted a can of black beans for 1 of the corn and am very glad I did. A nice change-up to regular 'ol tacos. Will definitely be in my go-to dinner rotation!

I did not care for this recipe. This was just an uninteresting taco flavored dish.  Sorry, but a three star was the most I could give it. I think it's the lowest rating I have ever given a recipe on Allrecipes.

I think this needs to be renamed. I was expecting a taco. This is sooooo not a taco. It's Burrito. A baked Burrito for that matter.   A Taco Roll is usually called a Taquito and its made with corn tortilla and fried.

Great for using up leftovers! I had leftover taco meat and some rice so I looked through the site for ideas and came across this recipe. It worked great and the potential for modifications are endless. I Heated up the meat and rice in a skillet and tossed in the other leftover items, cheese, onion, tomato, etc. Warmed the tortillas in the microwave, filled with heated mix then topped with salsa and cheese. Baked at 350 for 20 min until warm. Soooo tasty, quick and easy!

I cooked my meat with onions and garlic and followed the rest of the recipe... tasted the mix before filling my tortillas. I then decided it was missing some flavour... added 1/2 of the salsa jar to the mix... added a can of refried beans, 1 tbs of Chili powder and would have added some jalapeno but didn't have any. Next time, I'll use medium salsa instead of mild. This recipe is a good base but to me, it needed a little more punch to it.

This was outstanding! Pretty much stuck to the recipe except used all regular whole kernel canned corn undrained. Also used brown rice because thats what I had on hand and used my own home made salsa  on top. We all loved it and will certainly make again. Thanks nmm!

I forgot to add the taco seasoning mix, but did use medium spicy salsa and it still turned out great. Will definitely make again.

Add some salsa or tomatoes to meat mixture.  It was a little bland.  Or add more cheese.

Absolute delicious. My boyfriend and I devoured practically the whole pan. Next time I might want to try adding some taco sauce to the mixture and a different kind of meat like shredded pork or chicken.

I tried this recipe last night. I added onion and green peppers in the mix as well as added jalepenos to the top while baking. My husband loved it! Quick and easy!

This was a fantastic way to spice up regular tacos. My sister and boyfriend absolutely loved it! My boyfriend said it's in the running for his favortie thing I've made :) I followed the recipe exactly besides using one can of Mexi-Corn instead of the two different kinds. Will definitely be making this again!

We added refried beans and black beans to the mix and added lettuce and sour cream after it came out of the oven.  My family loved it! We will definitely have this again.

Took too long to make, and didn't taste great. Thought it would be have been much quicker and much tastier.

I'm sure they would have been great as the recipe was written, but I didn't have minute rice so I quickly sauteed garlic, added some cumin and onion pwdr and Cavendars Greek Seasoning- browned rice in olive oil and added a can of stewed tomatoes and water to make the Spanish rice. I didn't have taco seasoning so I just used some of the above seasonings, ground beef and re-fried beans, corn & diced green chilies; Rolled both up in tortillas and mixed sour cream and salsa together to spread on top and topped with cheese. Then baked as directed.

This recipe was fabulous. My only suggestion is to change the name. It's more of a burrito than a taco, but it definately deserves five stars!

I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, and that looked like WAY too much corn, so I made some adjustments, and it was incredibly yummy!

This was pretty much perfect! I try many recipes and they're not all hits but this one definitely was. My VERY PICKY husband LOVED it and it will be come a regular in our household.  

I made a few changes: no corn (personal choice,) added 1/2 can black beans, 1/2 cup salsa & 2 spoonfuls of Sour Cream to the meat mixture before wrapping in the tortillas.

Highly recommend this EASY & delish dish!

Tasty!!  I gave it 5 stars since the family loved it, but I did make a few substitutions.  I did not have any corn, (or rice) but added a sauteed onion to the ground beef and taco seasoning.  Also, I poured  a can of enchilada sauce over the rolls, then shredded cheese.  Served with shredded lettuce, sour cream, and diced tomatoes. My DH asked if these were enchiladas (due to the sauce and how they looked) and I told him, "NO!  Its a Taco Roll!"  He said they were delicious, no matter what their name....

Such a simple, quick recipe which is incredibly flavorful.  My toddlers loved it!  I didn't use instant rice (not a fan) but that can be cooked while browning meat and warming oven.  I think I will add either more cheese to filling or try the tomato sauce suggestion from other reviewers.  I wouldn't call the filling dry, by any means, but it could have used something.  BIG FAN!

Quick, easy, delicious.  My family loved these.  The only change I made was to just use 1 whole can of regular corn, as I didn't have any of the no-salt-added kind.  Thanks for a real family pleaser!

Very good and easy.  I added black bean to the mixture.  Also, I smeared about a tablespoon of sour cream inside the middle of the tortilla then sprinkled with some chopped green onion before adding the mixture.  Will be making this again!

Too much sodium & MSG in packaged taco seasoning for us.  I left out package of taco seasoning and used 2 kinds of chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, Mexican oregano, cayenne(just a little) to taste instead. threw some chopped onion and garlic in with Xlean beef and used Frozen corn, reduced sodium pintos(extra protein) then added no sodium beef stock to mixture to skillet instead of water. Used shredded Mexican cheese instead of cheddar--we like it better on TexMex/Mexican foods. I Sliced up an avocado, chopped a tomato, put out some sour cream, hot sauce and more salsa to be added to taste. Dish is plenty for us to have leftovers & they were even better.

Very easy and tasty.  Used corn and rinsed black beans.  Next time will add some jalapeno peppers for extra kick.  Put the taco bar out so we could top with our favorite toppings (black olives, lettuce, sour cream, etc.)  Thanks for the super easy recipe!

"Meh" was our overall reaction. It seems like an extra hassle for not that much of an improvement. We decided to stick to the classic Taco Tuesday.

This was a good recipe to use up things in the fridge. I put the end bags of a couple of different cheeses and I used 1/2 jar salsa in the burger that I had in fridge. A bag of my frozen corn went in and I put in sriracha chili sauce, little more then a tbl to zip it up, along with taco mix from a bag. Topped it with mild enchilada sauce but next time I'll use salsa. Next time I want to add a little sour cream to burger mixture too. This is a keeper!

Gave this recipe a try and it was a hit.  I did make a couple of changes.  I doubled the recipe and used on can of corn, added one can of spicy black beans, used Mexican Blend cheese, and whole wheat tortillas.

The baking just added extra cleanup and work.  Partial ingredients add complexity.  The recipe is fine with a can of corn and an entire packet of taco seasoning.  I also think you could eliminate the cheese in the filling without sacrificing taste.  Make the filling - minus the cheese, and with an entire packet of seasoning and just the low sodium corn - as a simple burrito filling.  Serve the salsa and cheese at the table

I would rate higher if it had more flavor as written. I tasted mixture before filling tortillas and then added another package of taco mix. The package I used was for 1lb ground meat and the recipe calls for 1lb to 1 pkg. I also threw in onions while browning meat. I also used just one can of "low salt" corn.
