I made this for Thanksgiving and my family loved it! I cut big pieces out and served it like cake with cool whip on top. Very tasty! I did have to increase the cooking time to an hour because it had not cooked in the middle after 45 min.

These were awesome and easy to make.  The crust was thick and yummy.  The only problem is it would be difficult to serve them as the picture indicates, cut in pieces on a plate.  They are two soft.  I would reccomend serving this on plates with a fork.  At my party no one grabed one of the plate they took the brownies instead.  However, they all took some home to eat later.

I enjoyed the taste of this recipe, but had trouble with the cooking time. I burned the bottom layer because I was too busy paying attention to the top and waiting for it to brown. After 45 minutes it was not browned on top. At 55 minutes I burned the bottom. 
It is great served warm, but does fall apart easy. Definitely recommend serving with whipped cream. Absolutely grease the pan!

I was a little leery of the pumpkin--cranberry combination but was pleasantly surprised.  Overall this is an easy treat to make for the holidays as long as you have the time to put together the different parts.  ***Note I think this is better served warm with whipped cream rather than cold.

Very tasty despite the odd combination of ingredients.  Definitely put foil or parchemnt paper underneath.

what a fantastic recipe!!!  I would, however, suggest to grease the baking dish.  This was a big hit with the family and the guys at the gym.

Easy to put together.  Neat combination of cranberry & pumpkin.  Be sure to cool to room temperature before cutting or removing from pan, they need to set up first.  Didn't change a thing.  Excellent!!

These bars are fantastic!!! Rave reviews all around. However, I would suggest making a more stable crust, maybe graham cracker? When served warm they lose their form. so maybe it' s better when served chilled.

I would enjoy this more if the pumpkin pie layer was a bit lighter and fluffier.

These tasted fine, but not spectacular.  The main reason I made them was because the picture was so pretty.  The layers don't turn out nearly as colorful or distinct as in the picture, and it's very hard to remove from the pan intact.  I didn't grease the pan and wish I would have.
