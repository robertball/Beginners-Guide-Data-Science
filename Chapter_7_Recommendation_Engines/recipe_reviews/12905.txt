I added a few things to spice up this recipe and it was the BEST chicken noodle soup that I have ever made.

I brought it to a work potluck lunch filled with tons of other soups and my entire crockpot was emptied with everyone telling me how wonderful the soup was!

I added 2 cans of cream of chicken soup to thicken the soup (it adds so much flavor), 2 cans of chicken broth, fresh carrots, celery and mushrooms, garlic, 1 whole onion (take out when soup is done)and salt and pepper to season.

It came out absolutely DELICIOUS! You can make it on the stove or in the crockpot. Hint: Freeze any leftovers and you only have to heat it up for a cold winter day!

It was definetly a good start, but it needed some extra to really give it some flavor. First I cubed my chicken while slightly frozen, so it was easy to slice and would cook faster. Then I followed what the buliion label said for cubes to cups of water, which was 1 cube per cup of water. I also added 1 can of cream of chicken. I also cut up some carrots and threw them in then too. I let that all boil and cook. Then I added the noodles and let them cook as well. We dont like soups that are mainly broth so I added probable more noodles than most would as well as more chicken and carrots probably too. But my boyfriend is SUPER picky and he loved it.

With a few changes, this was a hit . . . and the leftovers were fantastic too!
I used 2 lb chicken, 8 cubes of knorr chicken boullion, 2 cans cream of chicken soup, 10-12 cups water, 2 bags frozen egg noodles, celery, carrots, and vidallia onion.  Fantastic!

This is an easy chicken noodle soup to prepare and tastes very good. I added half an onion, diced, and a whole clove of garlic (also diced) to add to the flavor. This is the kind of supper to have ready for the family on a cold winter night.

That is clearly not an appetizing picture for such a tasty, easy recipe. We had leftover chicken from boston market so I wanted to do something with it other than sandwiches, etc. This was perfect, I would almost recommend thickening it with corn starch. Add fresh celery and carrot, gives it a nice color. (sidenote: add those before the noodles so they can soften because the egg noodles cook quick)

I didn't know how to start a homemade chicken noodle soup.  This recipe was great for helping me out.  I added carrots, celery and used stars instead of noodles.  Both the kids and my husband loved it.  Thanks so much for a simple starter recipe.

This was admittedly easy, and was fairly good, but nothing to rave about.  It seemed a lot of water for the amount of bouillon, and I was afraid the flavor would boil away with the water, so I added it later with the noodles.

I just want to say Thank You to Lori for not trying to be a Connoisseur, and just giving this basic recipe.  I am not a cook and am a very picky eater.  I can't eat most green vegetables or spices.  Even celery and ordinary pepper burn my mouth.  Others have been able to take this recipe and add things to make it their own, which is much easier than trying to remove all the things you don't like or want, and hoping it still comes out well.  This was perfect for me.

Delish! I used half chicken stock and half water. That made 4 cubes plenty. I also season the chicken with a little parsley and thyme and add frozen carrots and sometimes peas for some veggies and I do probably add a little extra noodles. Also, don't bother cutting up the chicken with a knife, it shredds nicely with a couple forks. I had no idea how simple homemade soup could be. This is now a winter regular at our house.

I was looking for a easy soup to make and freeze. This was super easy.. after reading reviews I tweaked it a little.. I huged a huge stock pot 24 cups water, 12 chicken cubes, carrots, 3lbs chicken and a lb of abc noodles... turned out really well and I also added 2 cans of cream of chicken like some of the other reviews mentioned

I made this pretty much as written. I used breasts for the chicken meat. I don't know much about egg noodles, and couldn't find "thin" ones, but I used some "medium egg noodles" and they looked thin enough to me. I boiled the chicken for 20 minutes before cutting it up, and the noodles were boiled for 7 minutes. Like many other reviewers, of course it seems logical to me to add celery and carrots to the soup, but just rating this as is, it was a very good soup. A decent amount of the liquid boiled down, so the results weren't watery, the broth flavor was prominent but not too strong, and the ratio of chicken to noodles was just fine, in my opinion. It may be a great base soup, but it's great as is, too. I've already made this twice.

This is a good base recipe.  It turned out very tastey and the chicken tender.  I added 1/2 cup chopped onion and 1 cup each sliced carrots and celery.  I also added 1/2 tsp. each basil and oregano and 1/4 tsp. ground black pepper.  I added all of this along with the chicken, covered and simmered for 15 minutes, then I added the noddles.  I also eliminated a step by cutting up the chicken while raw, instead of waiting until it is cooked.  The great thing about this recipe is that you can add whatever vegetables and seasonings you like.  Have fun!

This is a good soup, but I agree with the comments about how you need to add chicken broth and cream of chicken to make it more flavorful. A great soup for a sick friend or just to eat on a cold day.

Yummy! I had chicken thighs on hand so I used that with 4 carrots and about a cup of mushrooms. Fusilli instead of egg noodles. I used about 1.5 lbs chicken and 10 c water with 4 tbsp better than bouillon. It was a little salty though. I also added thyme and 2 cloves chopped garlic and some black pepper.

This is THE BEST chicken noodle soup without going through the tedious task of making it the traditional style with a whole chicken etc.  This is 10x easier and tastes just the same, in my opinion.  I did add celery and carrots, and used thin egg noodles.  It is the number one go to dish I make for myself on a cold day or for my loved ones when they are sick.

This recipe is awesome... I just add two cans cream of chicken soup, and cook and throw in a 12oz package of Mexican vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, corn, some pepper) which works amazingly.

I loved this!  I used 2 cans cream chicken soup and one of cream of mushroom.  I added to cans of chicken broth and threw in a couple of bulion cubes.  I added a can and 1/2 of carrots.  I poured a whole bag of egg noodles in it when it was close to being done.  Great recipe that will travel to work with us for a few days.  Even my picky 4 year old loved it!!

I thought this soup was pretty good. I did add the celery and carrots along with some diced garlic, and pepper. I also added a little bit more water then what was called for (since I like more broth), and had to add more bouillon cubes to get the flavor I wanted. Overall, it was a great soup! I will definitely make this many more times in the future!

This was delicious!  I also added a few things. Sliced carrots, 1 can cream of chicken soup and 1 can cream of mushroom soup.  I used 3 cups of noodles and it made for a heartier soup.  Thanks

Great flavor, but needs some color. I added small slices of carrots and celery to the chicken while cooking. I also cut the chicken up before cooking so it would cook faster and I wouldn't have to wait for it to cool off enough to cut up after cooking.

Once again I am reviewing this recipe truly because I didn't change it one bit. I made it the way it was suppose to and it came out just fine. You should have all ingredients on hand so it is a quick and easy soup. Now that being said the third time I made it I did add some more things like celery, carrots and onion but I did not change or alter the original base soup.

This is a great recipe and should be called "Simply Chicken Noodle".  It's simple to make and is simply chicken and noodles.  It's so easy my kids made it today.  We have made this recipe countless times and it's a great stand in for a can of chicken noodle soup - and much tastier.  It works well with any add-ins you like.  I generally don't add anything (well, sometimes I sprinkle a bit of parsley in it) but I use linguine or angel hair pasta broken into 1" pieces instead of egg noodles.   Great soup!

I used many of the recommendations of other reviewers including adding a whole onion that I took out after cooking.  I also used the 2 cans of cream of chicken soup to add to the overall 8 cups of liquid.  For vegetables, I added fresh carrots, celery and spinach.  Very good recipe and simple too!  My husband said it's the best soup he's ever had!

I made this tonight for my family - it is cold and rainy here in KS today. This was a GREAT recipe - here are my additions based on other reviews: I sauteed onions, carrots and celery in a little Olive Oil at the bottom of my pot, then added chicken, water, and boullion (11 cups water, 8 boullion cubes for 8 servings), let it cook awhile and added 2 cans cream of chicken soup and a 1 lb. box of Orzo - FANTASTIC. Thanks so much for the great recipe - I have been looking for a good chicken noodle soup recipe, and this one is a keeper!!

I threw in carrots, celery and onions.  I used a combination of bouliioin cubes, chicken stock from the box and water and it tasted great.

Tonight I am going to try throwing in matzo balls instead of the noodles.

So simple. Flavor would vary widely I guess depending on the boullion used. I used 3 tbsp better than boullion, and 1 cube of knorr vegetable boullion. Used 10 cups water, and added a cup each of celery and carrots, a quartered clove of garlic and some parsley at the end. Used broken angel hair pasta and chicken breasts. Very tasty, and super easy and quick. Great easy, basic recipe.

I really liked this recipe. I did change a couple things from reading previous reviews, though - I added a bit of garlic powder, boiled an onion in it, and cut the chicken into cubes *before* putting it in the pot. Once I made it with a can of cream of chicken, and once without - honestly, I didn't taste enough of a difference to make me bother doing the cream of chicken thing again. I did add vegetables. There wasn't much broth by the time it was done cooking - but I like that. I don't like my soup to be very watery. My boyfriend loved it, too!

IT WAS SO EASY!! and fast, I loved it but added my own touch. I selected the serving for 7, I added about 2 cups more noodles and I just used canned carrots. I added italian seasonings, and garlic. It needed more bouillon, about one per cup of water... then  just add rolls and it was the best meal for the first unexpected snow fall in early Oct :)

Super easy and hit the spot. Made it for myself and my husband while we get over the Holiday yuck and it turned out great. Next time I'll be adding some veggies and something to thicken it. A great starter base!

Great basic start for Chicken Noodle Soup! Like others, I personalized it with what I knew I'd like.  I added some Thyme, carrots, celery and touch of onion.  I used my own chicken broth, and added some bullion/water of course.

I made a few changes per other reviews. Firstly, i used rotisserie chicken from Wally World. Also, I did half water, half chicken broth. I added 2 cans cream of chicken soup. I also added a small bag of frozen mixed vegetables (peas, carrots, corn, green beans) and sprinkled a bit of parsley in with the salt and pepper as well. It was DELICIOUS. My hubby even enjoyed it and h e's on the pickier side. We have had it 2 days in a row now and will definitely be making it again in the future! :)

Wow. This recipe was simply fantastic. I used a rotisserie chicken carcass I had frozen from a previous meal. I simmered it in the stock for about 25 mins before starting the recipe. Then remove it from the stock and pick off all of the leftover chicken tidbits and add back into the soup. If you’ve never done this before I HIGHLY recommend it, make the soup SO much more soulfully rich and nutrient dense! A+ from our household!

I'm giving this four stars cause it's exactly what I wanted- simple, basic without added veggies etc. I followed it to the t and it was pretty much what my sick self wanted... however, my chicken was super rubbery so might I suggest that the chicken be simmered and not boiled?

Made this today for my 4 year old who has been sick for 3 days now. I didn't have any bouillon cubes, so I used half water/half chicken broth. Added carrots and 1 can of cream of chicken soup. She ate it up, so did the rest of my family that evening. Thank you!

This was a hit! My family doesn't care much for soups, but with the advice of other reviews it was heartier than most soups. I added celery and carrots, and used more chicken. Good soup!

I added some onion, parsley, salt, and pepper.  (Some tabasco sauce would be awesome too!)

This was very easy!
