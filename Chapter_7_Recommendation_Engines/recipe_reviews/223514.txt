Really good way to use the mountains of zucchini & corn from the garden.  I added a jalapeno, a red hot cherry pepper and about a half cup of flour. I think next time I might add a bit of cayenne to give it even a bit more kick.
I had either too hot or too much oil. It was popping like crazy, so be careful!

Very good and easy to make.  I used garam masala instead of the curry powder.  Good way to use up all those extra zucchinis.

Good recipe, but added about 1 cup of panko crumbs and omitted the curry for the kids. My daughter is the pickiest eater ever and loved this. My son is shoveling it in.

I had problems with these fritters staying together.  Had to double the egg and flour to actually make something like a "batter", and even still they didn't stay together well and were nearly impossible to keep together when turning.  There's something "off" with the batter ingredients in this one...and btw, one should NEVER use olive oil to fry with!!  Try coconut oil, goes nicely with the curry :)

Not very flavorful - these would probably taste much better with besan (chickpea flour) instead of regular flour.
