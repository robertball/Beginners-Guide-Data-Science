I didn't have mushrooms.  I also used Stove Top.  Instead of mushrooms I used fresh cranberries (cooked and sweetened) and a couple of chopped up apples.  I also didn't have monterey jack, so i used mozzarella.  My husband was on his way out to the dentist and was upset he wouldn't be able to eat it!  We ate it with gravy and it was terrific.  It did make excellent leftovers for lunch!

Totally try it with hot sausage!  I added carrots, celery, and onion to the stuffing just like my family always does. That makes it a little healthier and more rounded out meal. :)

This was a fabulous meal.  I didn't have fresh mushrooms so I just used canned, but I fried them up with onions in some olive oil and minced garlic first to give it some more flavor.  I used one whole package of stove top stuffing and just water b/c I didn't have any chicken stock.  It turned out great.  My husband loved it and so did my kids.  This one will definatly be a staple in my house.  Thankyou!!

My house smelled like Thanksgiving after I made this!  It was so easy to make and delicious.  It's definitely not a low cal/low carb dish, but for a once in awhile treat, it's really good.  I used the cranberry stovetop stuffing and added what other reviewers recommended, such as sauteed onions and celery.  I also added a chopped apple. Pecans would be a nice addition in the stuffing. This was very good and I will add it to my recipe file to use in the future.  Thanks for the recipe!

I really like sausage and love stuffing and mushrooms. This is one of those, 'why didn't I think of that?' meals. I ended up using the whole can a chicken broth after reading others reviews. It was great! We ate all of the leftovers.

This was soo easy for me tonight. My dad had grilled the sausages on the weekend and sent home the left overs.

I used a box of stove top and a whole can of beef broth, threw in some carrots and diced red bell pepper.  I only had mozzerella cheese so I threw that in as well. 

Looking forward to having the left overs for lunch tomorrow!

Pretty good, though my husband didn't like the mushrooms, so I might try bell peppers instead next time.

This was great.  Browned the sausages and mushrooms in the skillet and mixed an enitre can of chicken broth with the stuffing (I used about 1/2 bag of Sage and Onion stuffing - but I added more sage and onions), generously sprayed my pan and plopped it all in there.  I shoulda thought not to put the cheese on until the end, but I checked on it and then covered with foil and it was fine.  I just added more cheese for nice melty stuff.  Oh, and I used Hot Italian Turkey Sausage.  My husband was pretty happy with the whole thing.

::::sigh::::  I love all of the ingredients in this recipe, but it didn't turn out well.  It was definately missing something both taste-wise and color-wise.  It looked terrible on the plate.  Perhaps if some red pepper were added?

I made this recipe tonight, and my boyfriend and I loved it. I added more cheese and mushrooms than were called for. It was quick and easy to make, and it was very flavourful.

I didn't let the grease out of the sausages while I was browning them, so the grease leaked out onto the stuffing while they baked.  I used spicy italian sausage, and that was fine, but the stuffing was a little soggy.  Not sure I'll make again.

I used what I had at home which was italian sausage, canned mushrooms, italian spice stuffing, broth, monterey jack & cheddar mix. The ingredients tasted great together. I usually don't like italian sausage but this recipe was pretty good.

This was just okay. The stuffing turned out very soggy. The sausage was a tad undercooked at 30 min but I had to take it out because the cheese was over melting. I don't think we will be making this again.
