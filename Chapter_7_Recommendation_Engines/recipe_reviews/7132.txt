This bread dough was wonderful!  I can't eat chives so instead I added fresh crushed garlic, basil and oregano.  I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup.  Made very tender, tasty crescent rolls with no kneading  and very easy to handle dough!  Thanks

I thought these were a little too sweet but my husband and 5 year old daughter loved them. I shaped them into normal rolls which I thought were more practical. Next time I would leave the sugar out.

These rolls had excellent flavour and were gone in a day. My chives are not up yet so I used green onions, and they were a bit strong. I halved the recipe and I only got a dozen not the 25 stated, but this was not an issue as I was only making them for two of us. I loved that there was no kneading required. Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe!  Excellent light and airy.  So easy.  These will be on the Thanksgiving table this year.  Tip for those that have had difficulty.  Do not over mix this dough.  It will be a little sticky, don't add more flour.  After the rise over night the dough will be easier to handle.  I got about 34 good sized rolls and they were all gobbled up before I got a chance to freeze any.  This is a keeper.  Thanks.

I made these again for a catered event yesterday.  I used dried chives, bacon bits and grated Cheddar cheese.  Formed into 2 oz buns.  Filled with egg salad.  They were amazing.  Not one sandwich left!  Thanks again.  BTW, 2 oz buns yeilded 24 rolls.

Recipe is fantastic. For what it's worth, I had used light sour cream (girl's gotta watch the ever expanding wasitline from eating yummy food)
Couple of suggestions:
1. Proof yeast in warm water before adding to other ingredients.
2. I had mix the ingredients in my kitchen aid mixer with the 'stir' function.  When dough has formed, beat it with medium speed for about 2-5min (check dough often. Once indentation remains, it's done)
3. Refridgerate until dough is workable. My suggestion is to lighly flour the work surface to prevent sticking. Also, I lined my work surface with wax paper when i work with sticky dough.
4. Follow recipe instructions and let the shaped dough rise. Just leave it to rise till doubled in size and then bake.
The results are fantastic!

If I could give a slightly more detailed rating, I would give this a 5 minus.  These were definately better than "pretty good" (which is my 4 star rating) but I have a couple small comments for improvement.  First, I did not expect them to be so dinky...  timy little rolls - sort of a "tasty treat" size.  And secondly, they were soft throughout - like a dense, really good hot dog bun.  I am new to bread making (my first try) so I do not know what would give the consistency I expected but just wished these had more of a crust or at least a distinction from outer to inner.  As it never claimed this I would not mark it down - just an observation.  Taste was great.  The overall texture I enjoyed too.  Still trying to get my brain around the return on my time investment tho...  But I am willing to keep plugging away at that concept though after making these.

My only change was to halve the recipe and not shape in crescent roll.  I just made golf ball sized rounds.  I did refrigerate overnight and I don't think the dough rose at all.  I took the bowl out the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature about 2 hours before shaping.  The rolls taste "off" to me.  They are soft and tender.  I'm not sure I'd make them again.

I have become very familiar with any type of dough and was surprised to find that this one didn't rise at all when taken out of the fridge! Although convenient because there is barely any kneading involved, I found the rolls very bland. I waited until the first batch was finished before dealing with the rest of the dough and am glad I did so. I added a touch of Thyme and a TBSP of garlic to each of the remaining 3 rounds before throwing them in...more flavour, came out great!

These rolls got rave reviews at Thanksgiving dinner.  Much more popular than the wheat rolls I also made. I used Lite Sour Cream and didn't refrigerate the dough overnight.  I allowed the dough to rise for 1 hour, then formed the crescent rolls and allowed them to rise for an additional hour before baking.  The rolls had a nice soft texture, with a bit of tang from the sour cream and great chive flavor.

These were incredibly popular at my dinner party of 20.  Quite a few people asked me for the recipe or begged me to make them again.  Be aware that the recipe doesn't make 50 rolls (I made 32).

These came out okay, but were not as flavorful as I thought they'd be.  I may try the recipe again, in case I messed something up, but I was a bit disappointed.  :-(

Nice rolls.  Yes, the dough is sticky, but you can always add flour.  These have a nice flavor and although I didn't do the crescents bc I wanted bread and regular rolls, I can see how these would be good that way.  I thought these had a nice flavor and a firm crumb.  Thanks for the recipe!

everyone in my family just devoured these rolls. i was surprised to open my fridge thsi morning and see how much the dough had rose. i was a little worried about how sticky and moist the dough was before i started kneading and rolling it out but they came out perfect. golden brown on the outside. super soft on the inside. the best rolls i've ever had. soft and light. perfect with any meal.

YUM!! I wasn't sure if you'd really be able to taste the sour cream and chives but you definitely can. I think the sour cream makes the rolls very tender. So I threw everything in my bread machine and let it mix everything, then refrigerated as the recipe states. I think when I make these again, I'll skip the refrigeration part and just make basic roll shapes instead of forming the crescents, it would be much easier.

Incredibly easy, and a WONDERFUL end result.  Rolls were tender,soft, and had a delicate flavor.  Very easy to make.  Be careful not to get the sour cream too hot, or it can curdle.  Quantity is wrong on the recipe - if you divide the dough into 4 pcs, and cut each one into 10 wedges, you get 40 pcs.  I used my pizza cutter to easily cut the wedges.  This recipe will be a filed with my 'it's a keeper' recipes.

I've made many types of rolls before this, and I would say the taste of this one is pretty similar to the ones I like to make, which is why it got 4 stars. However, I do think it needs to be kneaded before being left to rise. I'm assuming that the recipe instructs you to put the dough in the fridge because it contains sour cream, but every recipe I've read says that cool temperatures make it harder for bread to rise. Mine didn't end up rising at all, even after being left overnight, and as a result, the rolls were very small and dense.

made this into crescents with an overflow of chives from the garden.  a most forgiving dough. i did flour my board before rolling out. forgot to give them a second rise and just baked and they were very light, tender and tasty. it is a VERY SWEET dough. sugar could be cut. i will make again cutting back on the sugar. a brush of butter with some sprinkled cheese would be nice too.  this could easily make itself an hors d'ouerves with the addition of a slice of cheese and meat rolled in before baking.

These rolls have a very good flavor and are very light in texture. The smaller size is perfect and in line with the concept of utilizing smaller portions.  I would strongly recommend a lower over temperature of 350 degrees and a shorter baking time.  If you are using the newer insulated baking pans, do not grease the pans as the rolls will tend to burn.

My son loved these rolls! even volunteered to help me make them. Great use for those chives that are so easy to grow.

Very good rolls. None of my grocery stores had fresh chives so I substituted dried ones. I think it would have been much better with the fresh as it didn't have much of the chive flavor.
