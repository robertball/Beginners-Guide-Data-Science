The chicken was dry and not as flavorful as I thought it would be.

This is a great recipe for healthy eating. I paired it with Three Bean Salad, also on the allrecipes website and it was a fine meal indeed. The recipe does take some time and patience to prepare, but if you are not in a rush, your family will love this one. In terms of the sauce, I've had many that were better, but it is certainly a fun and interesting flavor--quite tangy--and knowing that the ingredients are on the healthy side somehow makes it taste better.
