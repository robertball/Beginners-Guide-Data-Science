Not my favorite Asparagus Cheese soup. It was however fast and easy.  In all fairness I used a medium cheddar cheese in place of the processed cheese, which may have changed the consistency.

I wasn't sure about this one, but thought I'd give it a try. It's fantastic, especially with bacon and extra cheese.

Tasty, cheesy goodness.  I am anti-american cheese, so I went with a sharp cheddar instead and it probably melted a little differently than that nasty fake stuff.  It tasted much better though.  The bacon is a must in my opinion and I just used real bacon pieces because I didn't feel like buying a whole pack of bacon for one piece.  The only down fall is that the soup was more watery than velvety in terms of consistency.

I made this for myself and was planning on eating the other half for lunch... But it was so good I ate the entire pot.  I didn't take the asparagus out of the broth to puree it, I just got out the immersion blender.  Also I left out the salt and added garlic powder.

Excellent!!!  We were skeptical - we're not huge fans of asparagus but are always looking for ways we like to eat different vegetables.  This soup is GREAT and so easy!!  I used shredded mozz. and cheddar rather than the processed cheese, frozen asparagus instead of fresh, and black pepper instead of white. I also cut the asparagus into pieces before cooking it and put it right into the saucepan - save yourself some dishes!  I served this with bacon cheese corn muffins.  Excellent!  I recommend doubling it so you have left-overs!

Excellent recipe.  I like that there is no cream.  Very easy to make. I didn't have any white pepper, but it was fine with black pepper.

This was pretty good, but it needed a little something and I'm not sure what! I will definitely make again, but will have to figure out how to tweak it a little bit. Thanks! Nice quick healthy dinner.

Very nice, and refreshing.  I did tweak it a bit.  I did not have chicken stock so I used vegetable stock.  YUMMY!!  I also substituted Velveeta Light for the American cheese slices.  I too, added garlic, but powder not salt, in addition to the seasoned salt.  My hubby, who does not like asparagus, had two bowls!

Soup turned out tasting like asparagus water.  Not bad, but not excellent.  It was fine to eat but I wouldn't make it again.

It was good and I liked it.  I was a little scared about it though, but it turned out nice.  I did not have white pepper, so I used regular.  It was still good.

This was exceptionally good. I followed the recipe exactly and was pleasantly surprised. It's quick and simple to make and very flavorful. This soup was wonderful for a first course, but would work with with some crusty bread and a salad as a meal.

Wow, talk about salty.  We could not eat it.  I would suggest not adding any salt until you taste it.

This is delicious.  Great alternative to cream based sauces.  I added some potato in order to thicken it up.

we use mild cheddar cheese and sometimes don't even add the bacon
