This wasn't bad, but it's not five star yet. It oddly gave me a hamburger helper taste. Maybe instead of salsa an enchilada sauce would work. It needs some tweaking.

Since my significant other has severe acid reflux I substituted Green Chiles  With a very small amount of salsa. I definitely will be making this again!!!
