I thought this was a really good dish! I didn't have whole wheat pasta, so I just used regular pasta. I also omitted the chick peas because I just didn't have them. Overall a delicious dish that I will make again! Yum!!

Delicious recipe and would absolutely make this again!  I was expecting the jalapeno sausage to be spicier but it's got a nice flavor.  The only changes I made was that I added about a cup of chicken broth to the pan because I didn't have any pasta water (I had made pasta earlier in the day) and I added about 1/4 cup of heavy cream and it made a really nice sauce for the sausage and veggies.

Loved this recipe! I would definitely make again! Such a great combination of flavors! The only change I made was to substitute broccoli for the asparagus(we don't like). Other than that, made as written!

I used a pasta trio (not whole wheat), artichoke hearts instead of asparagus, and asiago cheese grated over the top....not bad!

This recipe was delicious and I will make it again.   Since we don't have Al Fresco in our area, I had to substitute another chicken sausage but otherwise followed the recipe for the most part.  I did not have asparagus but used a dry shredded broccoli slaw that I had.  I also used whole penne instead of whole wheat shell pasta.  I would have used Al Fresco if it was sold in our area.

I thought this was okay.  I would have preferred more of a sauce instead of a medley of ingredients, and a spicier kick instead of just in the sausage.  The chick peas were odd too.  Maybe it would have been better as a cold pasta salad.

This was a huge hit with the family!  I didn't use Whole Wheat Pasta (never do) and I would have preferred if there had been a sauce.  But the sausage was great!

My first issue w/this recipe, is I hate opening cans/boxes and not using all of the contents (pasta/chickpeas).  I know it's my issue, but it's an issue, all the same.  That being said, I was pleasantly surprised w/this recipe, even WITH the sausage (and I'm a sausage hater).  Mr. LTH enjoyed it, too, and deemed it a solid "4".  We both enjoyed it for dinner, yet agreed it's not something we'd make again.  I subbed minced garlic for the roasted garlic puree and dried basil for fresh.  I ate some w/fresh mozz and some w/canned parm and actually liked the parm better.
