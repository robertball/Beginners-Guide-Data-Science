I had to review this recipe.  I've had it in my recipe book forever and I finally made it for bridal shower.  I read some of the reviews and I think some people are not making this quite right.  First I took the idea from the recipe to make it in a 9/13 inch pan.  The refridgerator crescent rolls fit perfectly into the bottom of the pan.  I cut the brie into little pieces and sprinkled it over the crust.  Then I stirred up the cranberry sauce and dropped it in little dollops.  I only used the 3/4 of a cup that was called for which is about 1/2 the can.  Then topped with the pecans.  It seems like other people smeared the jam all across it as you would pizza sauce.  This really isn't like a pizza.  It's little bar like appetizers.  They are wonderful.  Don't overdo the toppings.  It was the first thing to be completely eaten at the shower.  I will definitely be making it again.  The picture posted is nothing like what I made.  It looks like they used pizza crust.  Mine was visually appealing and tasty.  I think the people who complained about it running overloaded the pizza with too much jam.  I just wanted to update this by saying I've made this for so many events over the years and always get requests for it.  It is always the first thing to be eaten.  Sometimes men need convincing to try it, but once they have you can't keep them away.  Thanks for an excellent, easy recipe that I've used over and over.

I used jellied cranberry sauce instead of whole because that was all that I had. I think next time I will make the effort to get the whole variety or try raspberry preserves instead. The sauce didn't melt and looked clumpy. I would also add more pecans. My husband liked this more than me and has had three pieces tonight. The tart taste of the cranberry sauce cut through the thick creaminess of the brie quite nicely.

Loved this (a second one is coming out of the oven momentarily). It's a less-greasy alternative to baked brie, and very quick. I used a 10" springform pan, which worked perfectly to open up and slide the pizza onto a cutting board. Spiced up the cranberry sauce with a little cayenne and balsamic vinegar reduction (a splash of the vinegar would work fine). Try to get the softest (smushiest in the center) brie you can find, don't cut off the crust, and don't overload with ingredients to keep it crisp. A yummy, easy appetizer.

This is SO quick and easy.  Your guests will love this colorful pizza that is perfect for as an appetizer or a meal of itself!  Add a nice tossed salad with a sweet vinagrette dressing for a wonderful luncheon.

My children absolutely loved this!  What a fabulous combo. of flavors!  Following other reviewers, I cooked the crust a bit longer before topping with the ingredients.  I only left the pizza in long enough to melt the cheese thoroughly.  We had Lambrusco and a salad to complete the meal.  It was FABULOUS!  Thanks so much!

The crust was perfect in a 9x13 pan.  I did bake a little extra.  I also mixed hot pepper jelly with the cranberry sauce to give it a little zip.  Was enjoyed by all

I served this to guests and everyone loved it.  I read the reviews before making it, and there are varied reactions, but it was a hit here.  I used my pizza stone, pre-baked the crescent roll base, as instructed, then sprinkled small bits of brie over each crescent slice, followed by dollops of cranberry sauce.  I did leave the crescent roll slices separated, rather than pushed together as in the photo shown.  I forgot to buy pecans, but will add those next time.  The resulting slices were just crisp enough, not too soft as other reviewers mentioned.  I cut up the slices into bite-size pieces before serving.  I did have a little trouble with the slices sticking to the pizza stone, so I'd probably spray it next time.  My guests are asking me for this recipe!  I might try raspberry preserves next time, as other reviewers suggested.  Yum!

Very good! I agree the tartness of the cranberry against eh sweet of the Brie. Very good. Took others advice and cooked the crust till brown and made it crisp.

I gave this 4 stars since it was my first time making it. I used Cranberry orange relish with apple and ginger-Fresh & easy (a grocery store brand) instead of cranberry sauce and almonds instead of pecans. It was Delicious! Next time I will use more cheese as I was hesitant to put so much and a little less relish as this relish has a yummy but strong flavor. I am defiantly going to make this for company now that i know it's edible! This picture does not do this recipe justice. It is way better than the picture looks!

Great main dish or snack, I used wheat pizza crust and with cranberry as sauce topped with brie and spinach. Even my non-vegetarian friends liked it.

YUM! I still have WAY too much leftover home-made cranberry sauce and this is a delicious, easy use for it. My sauce ended up being about half whole berry, half crushed and it's perfect for this. Thank you.

Really Rich.  You need the 5 mins standing time so the melted cheese doesn't run off, and to cool a bit.

This is a keeper.  I put the cresent rolls in the bottom of a 13x9 inch pan.  Sprinkled the cut up brie on top - then dolloped the cranberry sauce on the brie.  I only used about half the can of cranberries.  Once it was done baking I smeared the cranberry and brie together.  Turned out great and was not runny at all - not sure what people are doing to make it runny - maybe too much cranberry sauce?

I made this pizza as a Christmas Day appetizer and our family loved it. The only thing I changed was I used refrigerator pizza dough rather than crescent rolls. I baked at 450 and found that I needed to lower the temperature and increase the time. Try it...I don't really care for Brie and I really enjoyed this pizza. The tart/sweet of the cranberry sauce blens nicely with the tangy/creaminess of the Brie.

They were tasty but not incredible, thus the 3 stars.  I used puff pastry sheets, whole berry cranberry sauce and double the amount of cheese.

I used cherry pastry filling and almond slivers instead of the cranberry and pecans. It visually looked rather iffy but after people got over the initial skepticism, the pieces practically flew off the serving trays. Everyone loved this and even though there was a large array of appetizers, it was easily the first to get devoured. I would definitely serve it again, it's so simple and was such a huge hit. Though I'd probably work on making it a little more visually appealing next time.

I tried this thinking it would be interesting and it sure was!  I added some chicken to it as well that gave it a bit of protein and a yummy punch since I browned it with garlic.  My husband and I both say its a keeper and hes pretty picky!!

I thought this sounded great from the recipe, but when I saw it baking I was a little skeptical.  I used raspberry preserves, and I used the whole jar and still didn't have enough to cover the dough.  I popped it in the oven anyway, and the cheese and jam all ran together.  It was difficult getting it out of the pan without the cheese sliding off the dough.  I served it at my party anyway, and though it was messy, everyone raved about it.  Maybe next time I'll let it cool in the pan a little longer.  Thanks!

Amazing!  I used 1/2 canned whole cranberries and 1/2 seedless raspberry jam as others had suggested.  I used sliced almonds instead of pecans.  I even over cooked the pilsbury dough and it was still devoured!

Wow - what a keeper, I served this last night, it was the hit of the party! Great to look at AND eat! I'll be making this one again and again, thanks so much for sharing this treasure... (will be fun and easy to make so many variations if I can get past this one) :o)

This was so easy. Beautiful to look at and delicious to eat. I made it a couple of times for holiday parties and got many requests for the recipe. I did make a couple of changes. I used a homemade cranberry sauce that uses 4 parts cranberry to 1 part fresh raspberry, and I substituted almonds for pecans. This is a keeper.

Very disappointed.  I followed the recipe to the letter, but found that the brie didn't melt down as the picture shows. (I even put it in the oven 10 minutes longer). I tried a piece of it myself, and was unimpressed.

The flavors were good, you cant go wrong with Brie.  It wasnt a huge hit though.  I too used raspberry preserves.  I made it on a pizza stone and the inner part of the crust was pretty mushy.  Next time, I will do it on a pizza pan with the vented holes.

This got raves at our wine and cheese party.  I used the reduced fat crescent rolls (I know, I know. What's the point when you're then adding a half pound of brie...but it did reduce the trans fats at least!)  I also used raspberry chipotle preserves- mmmmm!  Sweet and spicy deliciousness!

Like other reviewers, I substituted seedless berry jam for the cranberry sauce.  I took this to a potluck, and everyone loved them.  Next time, I'll try using puff pastry or phyllo dough for a crispier crust.

This was fabulous!  I had homemade mixed berry jam that I used.  I'm NOT a brie fan but this was awesome.  Used it for a wine tasting that I had and it sold so fast I had to throw together another.  Prep quick, cook time quick and ready to go!

I'm crazy about both baked brie and cranberry sauce, so I had to try this recipe.  While it was easy to make, I was dissappointed with the crescent rolls' soft texture.  It just wasn't the right bread/crust for my liking.

This was great! We don't cook a lot but this was really easy and it tasted great! We finished the crust before adding the toppings and then turned down the temp. so that the cheese would melt but the crust wouldn't get any darker - it made for a nice and crispy crust. We also didnt have a pizza pan but a cookie sheet worked just as well. We'll definitely be making this again and again.

Boy, I wish I'd used crescent rolls instead of a pie dough, it was just too thin.  This is such a yummy recipe!  I bought raspberry jam, spread it on the dough (after baking dough for 5 or so minutes), then dropped the brie on, then thinly sliced fuji apples, then a little mozzarella.  Be sure if you use jam not to use too much, it masks the taste of the brie.  

Excellent, soooo yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

Really lovely appetizer. There were several people who balked at trying this, but once they did, they loved it.  It was simple to prepare and the pecans really make it special.

Great idea! I used raspberry preserves instead of cranberry sauce.  It was delicious.  I made it for a shower and it was gone in no time at all.  Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious. I made about half the recipe and put it in an 8x8 glass baking dish.  I am glad I did, the raspberry jelly was very runny.  Aside from the somewhat ugly look of it, it was very good and will make it again.  I may rub the crust with some garlic before adding the jelly and cheese.  I also used low fat crescent rolls.

This was really great... a big hit at our dinner party.  We left the skin on the brie, and used raspberry preserves (with seeds).  It was delicious!

I made this for a group meeting and it was the only thing that disappeared.  Very Yummy!  It did make a mess in the oven though, so I'm going to use a jellyroll pan next time.

I thought this was great.  I love brie, but I don't suggest trying a new brand of brie for this.  The one I bought was very, very bitter, but I could tell this would be a wonderful recipe with a less harsh brie.

This was very popular when I had company over.  I used slivered almonds instead of pecans as I had them on hand.  It was delish!  I did find the oven temperature a bit too high, so I used a lower temperature

I made this for movie night at our house and it was fabulous! I warmed up the last bit of it for breakfast the next morning and it was just as delicious as the night before. Great with or without pecans. And so easy!

This was good.  I used puff pastry, and seedless raspberry jam.  It didn't go over all that well at the party we attended.  I may not have used enough jam (I used about 1/2 the jar), or maybe I shouldn't have sliced the brie.  I don't know, just not as impressed as I had hoped to be over this one.

Great Appetizer and Easy to Make.  We read the reviews and also went with raspberry seedless jam/preserves versus cranberry.  Very delicious and a big hit.

Very good. I made this for a pizza party and was by far the best there and I'm sure it was the easiest. Everyone loved it and it was gone too fast.

I have served this twice and I was stunned by how people love it.  Using seedless raspberry jam in place of the cranberry sauce, this easy appetizer stole the thunder from some other, more time intensive appetizers.

I am not going to rate this recipe.  It would not be fair because we really don't care for the taste of brie cheese.  We did however enjoy eating ONE slice of this pizza. The crust was a bit soggy though.
