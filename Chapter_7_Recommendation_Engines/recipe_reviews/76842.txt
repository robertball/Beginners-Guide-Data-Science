I just made this recipe more or less.  For the sauce, I used non-fat yogurt, lemon juice, and curry powder.  I omitted the preserves as I didn't want a sweet flavor.  I used some lemon grass as well.  For the veggies, I used broccoli and asparagus.  I then added diced chicken to make a complete meal.  Yum!  Love the combination of lemon grass, curry, yogurt and lemon juice.  Will definitely make again.  I only gave it 4 stars because I did change the ingredients from the fruity sauce that this was intended to be.

Very similar to the base for Chicken and Broccoli casserole/Chicken Divan. Absolutely delicious!

I used this sauce to dress up frozen veggies for a really quick side.  I ran out of yogurt so I used sour cream and we just loved the fruity tangy curry pop this gave to plain frozen veggies.  We found it a bit flat the second night so best served fresh.
