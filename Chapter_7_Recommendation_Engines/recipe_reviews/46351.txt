I took lilacbuddacat's suggestion and used Absolut Vanilla vodka and homemade butter-maple syrup. It's quite the sweet shot. I wouldn't do more than one of these a night but it was interesting to try. Now I just have to get my husband to try it!

I'm surprised. It actually WORKS! I made it with Absolut vanilla and butter-maple syrup. My husband was skeptical but he actually liked it. Who'd a thunk?

Looks like my review of this has been removed! It was terrible. Not recommended.
