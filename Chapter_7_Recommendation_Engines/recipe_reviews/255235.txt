My family loved this dish. Full of flavor and textures. I have been wanting to make this for quite some time and was not disappointed. I added chocolate protein powder because that is what I had, but it worked well. I also baked in the oven rather than on a griddle, at 400 degrees for 15 minutes each side on parchment paper and they turned out great! Will become a breakfast staple for us since they are easy to heat up for a quick breakfast all week. Thank you!

These were the best pancakes i ever had.  They caught my eye cause im also a cracker barrel and trader joe guy.   I used to use box protein pancake mix from trader joes and top with Acai, berry mix by Dole,  i warm it in microwave and top the pancakes with it.  its like a warm berry topping, all natural sweetness.  i used to think i was eating the healthiest pancakes till i had these.  This added more protein with the nut and powder mix plus popping with awesome flavor.  Nice treat for after a good workout.  Thanks for sharing.  Just when you thought you were eating something healthy, this is much more healthy and fun to make.

These pancakes are delicious and full of great nutrition!!! I always use stevia sweetened Greek yogurt and my own blueberries and raspberries frozen from the summer harvest so this breakfast has only natural sugar. I will be making these pancakes often.

These were really good! I omitted the vanilla protein powder because I didn't have any. I've made them twice so far and will be making again. Just the right amount of sweetness!

I made these as written and personally I wasn't a huge fan but my husband and son liked them but said they were bland. I had texture issues as the pancakes were very moist. I did use the substitution as written for pumpkin pie spice and vanilla.
