This is a delicious and more visually appetizing dish when the thin mints are layered INSIDE the brownie. Pour half the batter in the pan layer the thin mints then top with remaining batter.

Good stuff! Doesn't get much easier than this and the end result was sooo delicious. The hardest part was waiting for the candies to cool before cutting (I stuck the pan in the fridge to speed up the process)! Seems like the biggest complaint from reviewers was that these weren't very pretty. To get that green and chocolate swirl color you need to use Andes Parfait mints not Creme de Menthe. The Parfait ones have much more green coloring than the Creme de Menthes. Thanks:)

I made these using the bagged andies mint baking pieces. Using half the bag. These are delicious but be sure and let them cool completely before trying to slice.

I got rave reviews for this and it was so simple to make! A couple hints: I popped the brownies back in the oven for 1-2 minutes to help melt the mints then just barely had to spread them. A few swirls and it looked great! And make sure you wait till the chocolate hardens back up before cutting. Yum!

The brownies taste great and are SO easy! However there was no stunning chocolate and green mint display. They were essentially brownies topped with Andes mints but you couldn't see the green.

Even though it was quick and easy it was a mess. I made this for a party and no one touched it because it looks so bad when you cut it. My kids made balls out of it afterwards and ate them.

Ijust made this recipe (after tasting an amazing batch a friend a school made) and it came out great. The frosting is swirled green and brown just like my friend's. I put the mints in the oven on top of the brownies for the last ten minutes and then spread them over the brownies with a spatula after I took the brownies out. Also for decoration I chopped up the extra mints and sprinkled them on top of the frosting when it was almost cool (so they would stick without melting). Hope that helps those of you who had problems with it. I highly recommend this recipe for school or parties!

This tasted good but didn't look pretty. I expected it to be swirled with green and black from the mints and it wasn't at all. But it was quick but I don't think I would make it again.

I made these last night and they were so yummy! The pan of brownies was eaten up by my family before the night was over. This is a very clever and simple idea to make something so tasty! No one could believe that I just melted chocolate mints on the top instead of making a complicated icing. I'll definately make this recipe over and over again. Thanks!

I used andies mint pieces like another reviewe.r (since that is what I had here) My kids seemed to really enjoy them. I turned my back and 3/4 of the pan was already gone.

My husband very much liked these but I can't say they are my favorite. VERY easy though.

These were very easy to make using a brownie mix. I used a combination of mint and semi-sweet chocolate chips instead of the mint candy. The chips swirled well and we all enjoyed these brownies. The chocolate-mint combination was perfect.

These are one of the EASIEST desserts to make. They are a no-brainer. I can't believe when people say they don't turn out right. Just make the brownies correctly and you can't go wrong.

The mints on top formed a hard crust so we had to eat them upside down. Also the brownie mix did not hold together well and fell apart when taking out of the baking pan which made it a good thing we were eating them upside down.

These brownies are delicious but when I have made them in the past I have crushed peppermint candies (the red and white swirled ones) to small/fine bits and sprinkled them over the top of the melted mint patties for a nice visual appeal and extra crunch!

Thin mints work great for this recipe and make for a nice presentation. I decided to experiment with Peppermint Oreo's and they were a huge hit as well. Mint and brownies pair well together especially during the holidays.
