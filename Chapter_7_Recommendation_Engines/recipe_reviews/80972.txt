Fantastic!  I forgot to put the parmesan cheese in the filling too, so I can imagine it's even better with it.  A little trick I learned when you are filling a chicken breast is to butterfly the chicken breast first and then pound it to flatten, you end up with a much bigger piece of meat to work with.  On the edges, pound it very thin, because when you are rolling and folding the edges in, the edges get very thick.

DELICIOUS! I made this for a group of 8 friends that get together weekly to cook and visit.  It was fun to make together - we pounded the chicken breasts thin, put the stuffing toward one end, and then just rolled the breasts around it and placed them seam side down (no need for toothpicks!). Everyone LOVED IT. Wouldn't change a thing.

C'est magnific- we absolutely loved this dish!  The only changes I made were using hot Italian turkey sausage, instead of pork, and 1/3 less fat cream cheese.  The recipe is a keeper!

SUPER! I have made this twice and it has come out great both times. There is no cream cheese in France, so I have been using St. Moret which works well. The second time I used swiss cheese because that was all I had and it was good too. I bet cheddar would be yummy..too bad I can't find it here =( Also, I only cooked mine for 30 minutes. Thanks for the post!

This one is great recipe which is fast and east to put together. I did alter this recipe to make it even better. I added mushrooms and spinach which I sauteed using olive oil. I also sauteed the italian sausage until barely brown; this speeds up the cooking process. To the stuffing mixture I added also about a 1/4 cup of mozzarella and about a teaspoon of minced garlic. Cooking the italian sausage ahead of time cut the cooking time. I only baked this in the oven 25-30 minutes. This recipe is a keeper.

My fiance made me this. It was fantastic! She followed the recipe to a tee. It was delicious. Almost as good as a stuffed mexican chicken I once had. I enjoyed it with hot sauce. 
Very good. I recomend it to all.

Very good and different.  The sausage mixture was a little rich and there was a ton of it, so next time I'll only make half.

We made this as part of the "Your Very Own French Bistro" menu.  It was really fantastic and made the evening.  The hot italian saugage we used had too much heat though, even for me.  Next time I am considering mild and perhaps adding a little crushed pepper to control the heat better.  Excellent.

This stuff was just amazing! My boyfriend loved the sausage stuffing for the chicken and, although it wouldnt all fit into the chicken breasts without oozing, he would not let me put any of it to waste! this is a visually delightful dish, especially as you are cutting it down the middle! I think I may have added a bit too much parmesan, it was a little salty in the middle. My fault for not using a measuring cup though! Also be SURE to use one of those meat pounding mallets, I have done this recipe once without the proper tools and it was 100x harder! It makes a world of a difference. This will be kept on my dinner rotation!

Was an okay recipe, but not worth the effort, for the end product.  For this much effort, I'll stick to chicken cordon bleu.

This is a great combination of everyone's favorite flavors, cooked in a fun way. It's important to flatten the chicken enough. I don't think I did, and it needed to cook longer than 45 minutes. I had extra filling, so I just put that in the dish along with the chicken, put bread crumbs on it, and baked it, too!

A curious recipe, but very tasty!  There seems to be too much sausage stuffing for only 2 chicken breasts, so I'd suggest either halving that part, or getting yourself some really big  breasts.

Very good.  This recipe is forgiving.  I forgot to use plastic wrap when pounding the first chicken breast, and so it tore pretty badly.  I had about 15 toothpicks holding it together, but the breadcrumb topping camouflaged so well you couldn't tell.  I will say that with the bechamel sauce it tasted slightly like biscuits and gravy.  Next time maybe I'll try a different sauce or just skip sauce altogether.

Delicious!  I debated about whether or not to do the Bechamel.  Went ahead and made'Bechamel Sauce' from this site.  Was glad I did, may have been too plain Jane without.  I had some leftover uncooked sausage so this recipe was perfect.  I used 4 good sized chicken breast pounded about a 1/2" thick and the filling yielded the perfect amount for the 4 breasts.

This was absolutely delicious! My whole family loved it. I used a bit less cream cheese than stated, just to cut back on calories, but I'm sure it's great with all the cream cheese, too.

Replaced Cream Cheese with Goat cheese, and added pine nutes and stuffed large chicken breasts (thin knife clears out a large pocket).  

Everyone loved it.

A number 1 triple star fantastic.  I forgot to put the Parmesan in with the cream cheese, silly me.  So I just put it over top the chicken before baking and it made a rather nice crisp crust!  So delicious!

Liked the flavor and the sauce that I made to go with this. A bit salty. I used mild Italian sausage and added some cayenne pepper.
