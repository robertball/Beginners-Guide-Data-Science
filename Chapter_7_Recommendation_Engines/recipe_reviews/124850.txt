How can you screw this one up? The bread is great, fast-rising, and no knead. The dough seems like it's so wet that it won't make, but it turns out with a good crust like an aged sourdough in just a couple of hours. For a more rustic look I have taken the halved ball and just put it on a cookie sheet, it forms a good loaf, not as flat as you would expect for as wet as the dough is.

Very easy to make! I even messed up and put the melted margarine IN the bread instead of brushing it on the top. Mine only took 35 minutes to bake. This made two free form loaves, one round and one long. Not sweet at all and the texture was chewy. This bread sliced very well and would make a great sandwich bread (no crumbs!). A big hit with the family, too. EDIT: I just made this again yesterday. This time I baked them in bread pans and brushed the butter on the tops before baking.....Made a more crunchy crust and I had crumbs this time. I think I prefer the free form loaves with no butter on top.Thanks for the recipe!

Another one of 'those' reviews since I modified the recipe so much that it's not even the same recipe! This was a HUGE HUGE hit and so easy that I had to review it, despite  all my modifications.  I followed the directions as written, but heavily modified the ingredients to make an herb and cheese bread.  These were my ingredients:  2 T (rather old) dry yeast 2 cups warm water (110 degrees to 115 degrees), divided 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 cups bread flour 1/2 c white whole wheat flour 2 teaspoons sea salt 1 tablespoon sugar 1 T EVOO - added to batter  2 t minced garlic 2 T simply tasteful spinach herb blend - added to batter  1 c finely shredded light cheddar cheese - added to batter  1 tablespoon EVOO - brushed on top 1 tablespoon poppy seeds - sprinkled on top

This is wonderful!  And so easy!  Try topping it with a mixture of 3 Tbs melted butter, 2 Tbs grated cheese (I use a parmesan, romano, asiago mix made by Kraft), 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp dried parsley.  Brush this on the loaves before the second rising and sprinkle with sesame seeds.  Excellent!

This is a really, really easy yeast bread. I proofed the yeast with 1 teaspoon of the sugar. I let it rise for 1 hr. each rising. I didn't use the poppy seeds. The dough is so sticky it seems it won't work, but it does. You can't really shape the loaves, I just kind of let it plop out into the pans (I used 2 round pryrex bowls.) The recipe makes 2 small loaves, certainly not 32 servings (!), more like 12 servings. The bread smells wonderful while baking, makes golden loaves with a nice crust, and a chewy center. It's almost a cross between a yeast bread and a quick bread in texture. Very tasty, a keeper recipe.

It doesn't get any easier than this.  I proofed my yeast then threw the rest of the ingredients into the bowl and let the mixer bring it all together.  I got interrupted by the phone, so it actually was kneaded for about 10 minutes, but I doubt that had any effect at all.  I baked one loaf right away and froze the rest of the dough for another day.  It baked up light, with a nice chewy crust and moist crumb.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe

Very easy bread to make, with great flavor.  Definately not a sweet bread, has more of a salty flavor.  Goes great with cheese and red wine.  A good bread to accompany meats and pasta.  Probably the easiest bread I've ever made.

This is a great, simple recipe!  I added a teaspoon each of a variety of Italian spices to the dough and sprinkled them over the top instead of using poppy seeds.  Fabulous.

Great bread!  The dough is very "wet" and I added about another 1/2 cup of flour before I read the other reviews commenting on this.  Even with the extra flour the bread turned out tasty.

So good, and easy! I wanted a crusty, chewy bread to serve with soup and this fits the bill. The fact that you don't have to knead it is a bonus. I can't wait to make it again.

This is really great bread! I usually bake once or twice a week, but was in a hurry and did not want to take the time to knead bread today- this was perfect. I made it as 2 rustic loaves, and loved it. It is a nice, flavorful bread, with a nice chewy crust. I will absolutely make this one many times!

If your bread doesn't coming out with a rise like your typical breads, don't worry. When mine came out of the oven looking the way it did I panicked because I thought I'd messed something up, but it tastes great and was chewy and not crumbly at all. Very good and easy bread recipe.

I tried this bread recipe just for fun, but didn't have the proper bowls to bake it in. I used two 9" cake pans instead. The bread turned out beautifully, but not very high because of the pans I used.  I decided to cut the whole thing in half through the middle, and make a huge sandwich with ham, salami, cheeses, lettuce, tomato, etc.  I cut it into 4 pieces and my guys loved the big sandwich! The homebaked bread made it extra good. I will make this simple and versatile recipe again, definitely.

Oh my gosh, I did not like this.  I doubt its the recipe's fault since it has such great reviews.....I can only conclude that i did something wrong although i can't figure out what it might have been.   I'm new to using a bread machine, i'll use that as my excuse.

YUM! Even with questionably old yeast, this turned out very yummy. Out of habit, I baked mine in loaf pans, and they came out about 2 inches thick (in case anyone is wondering). Probably my own error, but they stuck to the pans A LOT. Use waxed or parchment paper or else a generous butter/PAM/oil coating.

It was really simple, and my brother-in-law absolutely loves it. Instead of poppy seeds, I added some Italian seasonings and herbs [I made spaghetti with it] It was great all the same and nothing really went wrong, other than a small mess of flour. I also put it in a loaf pan instead of a casserole dish, and it worked out better that way. I did expect it to rise more, but I guess I'm just used to the fluffy breads my sister makes. Nevertheless, it was super good! I will definitely share this with more family and it will get made many more times!

Good recipe. I can't leaving kneading out :) but I didn't knead much. Felt weird putting in casserole dish, but I did. I didn't care for putting in bowl because it didn't hit all the edges, etc...silly I know, but I like bread in loaf pans or as French bread...so I made second time as baguettes, and was much happier. :) Very easy to make, oh and I omit poppy seeds as personal preference. Thank you!

Holy Cow! This was incredible! I've been making a lot of breads recently, the italian bread & honey whole wheat from this website mostly. This has been the best so far! I wanted to do half wheat and half white flour, but I just had 2/3 cup of wheat. Just that little bit added such a nice earthy sweetness! I do this when I make banana muffins, just a half cup of wheat flour makes such a subtle, sweet difference. I shaped one loaf as a baguette and the other as a round and baked them both on my pizza stone. Next time I'll use a pan so the bread can rise longer without fear of it falling off the edge of the stone! The bottoms were also soft, not crisp, so I'll play around with pans and cornmeal and maybe not use the bowl of steaming water in the oven like I usually do. Will report back! Also, I cut into this immediately and it tasted better without additional butter (I did brush butter on before baking). So good!

This was a super easy recipe to follow. I am new to break making, except for cornbread and biscuits. This was my first attempt to make this bread and it turned out great! My husband said that it is missing a little something something...I did omit the poppy seeds. I will make this bread again and again! It is awesome hot out of the oven with some butter and jam. I gave one of the loves to my neighbors and they said that it was really good. I think I may try  to make this in like a cupcake pan to make them like rolls. I will let y'all know how that goes!

This is one of those "Love, Hate" recipes. I bake bread fairly often. assemble ingredients, mix, knead.rise, knead, etc. I have made this bread 10 times! I am making it as I write this! What a simple, great recipe! That's the love part. I barely bake regular bread at all lately! that's the hate part. As others have suggested its a great hearty bread for stews and such. It will go great with the Lamb Irish Stew I have in the crockpot.
Thanks again!!

Good stuff!  I put one inside of a pie dish and it came out more crispy on the outside which went perfectly with my homemade pasta and marinara sauce dinner.  The other one I cooked inside of a pyrex bowl and it came out more moist; next time I think I will make one inside of a bread loaf pan so I can have it as sliced toast the next morning.

I am NOT skilled at baking yeast based breads, but this bread turned out incredibly delicious, even for me! So easy to make! I baked this so we could have bread with my beef stew, and my husband loved it.

This is a great recipe! We've stopped buying bread and just eat this.  I halve everything except for the yeast (we only need one loaf) and that works great.  The only changes I make is that I let it sit for over an hour on the first rise, and add a bit more water as it seems to give it a better hole structure. Delicious!

This bread was super easy and had a wonderful taste. I stuck to recipe exactly minus the seeds. I made it two days ago and am making it again today for Sunday dinner. I made the first loaf in a loaf pan and I put the second batch of dough on a  cookie tray and sprinkled with romano, garlic, and mozzarela. I made the mistake of keeping the second loaf in for as long as the first, but I'll not do that this time around. The "flat" loaf on the cookie tray makes excellent bread sticks!

This bread was wonderful and so easy to make! It has a lovely crunchy crust and isn't at all sweet. I baked one loaf in a 1.5 qt round casserole dish and the other in a large Pyrex bowl - both came out beautiful. I will be saving this recipe for use again and again!

This is a wonderful bread. Very simple to make. I make a lot of different types of bread and I am always looking for new bread recipes. This one is a keeper. My DH loved it, especially when I turned it into garlic toast. The only change I made was that I used half regular unbleached flour and half bread flour but that was only because I only had 2 cups reg. flour. I also cook for a sorority and I will be making this when school starts again. It will be a great recipe to use when I want to make bread that doesn't require a lot of attention and time. Thanks for sharing!

Wonderful bread!  Currently making my second batch.  The dough is very wet, but it comes out fantastic.  The melted butter on the top makes a nice flavour when baked.   This will definitely be in my bread rotation often!  Thanks!

Very yummy and best served right out of the oven.  I used and extra tablespoon of butter and mixed herbs on top instead of the poppy seeds.  This will definitely be my go to table bread recipe!

Well, it's bread... I thought it was tasteless, quite unfortunately. It's good enough to toast and then put bruschetta on (mostly due to the poppyseed flavor) but if I didn't have the bruschetta I would've not eaten it. Looks like I'll be on the hunt for another peasant bread recipe. :(

Some of the easiest bread I've ever made, though it is not the smoothest and prettiest since it is not kneaded.  It tastes very similar to the expensive 'artisan' peasant bread available in my local grocery store.  Just watch the time - the bread isn't ready in 1 hr. 5 min like it says at the top of the recipe; it takes about 2 1/2 hrs from beginning to end.  I usually use half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose flour.  Delicious!
