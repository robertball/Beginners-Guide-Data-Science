For all those who think part of the recipe is missing, its not.  You add the milk and sugar mixture to the chocolate in the bowl and beat it.  Its just like every other fudge recipe.  I  like the different types of chocolate in this recipe.  Be sure to use the highest quality chocolate you can afford.

My mom has made this fudge at Christmas for 30+ years.  This year I was planning to make it and was browsing recipes for comparison.  I was so suprised to find this recipe--the exact same one she gave me years ago!  It's wonderful and brings back so many childhood memories.  I remember she always used whole walnuts. She also put the whole recipe into one 9x13" pan so it was very thick.  She would line the pan with buttered foil, letting it hang over the edges of the pan, and lift the fudge out when it was cool and cut it into long bars.  
She wrapped the bars and kept them in the refrigerator for the whole holiday season, taking one out at a time to slice thinly for the cookie tray.

There is something missing in the instructions...After placing chocolate chips and bars in a bowl and scooping marshmallow creme into it, it is never mentioned what to do with it!  Please someone check the directions and make appropriate corrections.

Great fudge!  The kids wouldn't leave it alone.  I made the mistake of cooking the milk & sugar in a large pot instead of a medium one.  When the fudge hardened it was too dry.  I just crumbled the fudge into a glass bowl, added a little milk and heated it in the microwave until it melted.  Then I repoured it into my molds and it turned out beautifully.  Using quality chocolated really does make a difference.

my husband made a lot of fudge over the last 20 years. Three years ago, he found this one, and it is the only one we make now.  Amazing rich, chocolately taste.

I've never made fudge before, and I think this was a good recipe to start with.  It was easy and turned out great.  It made a lot more fudge than I thought it was going to be, but maybe that's because I didn't know what to expect.  Instead of evaporated milk, I just used some 2% and thought it tasted just as great.  It was melt in my mouth good.

I bake a lot, but have never made fudge before now.  This recipe was easy and the fudge turned out great.  My husband brought it to work with him (for 11 of his co-workers) and he said 3 or 4 of them told him it was the best fudge they had tasted.  I will definitely make this again.

I've made this recipe several times now, and everyone who has gotten some of the fudge rave about it and ask for the recipe!  It's so easy to make and always comes out great.  It's a good thing that it makes as much as it does!

This recipe called for a lot of different chocolate that I thought sounded wonderful. I found out that it was exspensive and a little dry. The recipe left out instructions which made it a guessing game.

This fudge is fantastic! Everyone here at Christmas said it was the best fudge they had ever ate. I'm a bit confused though. I followed the recipe as stated, but it only made one 9x13 pan. I had to have done something wrong, but for the life of me I can't figure out what. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I was warned not to lose it or else!

This was the Best!! Two pans one with foil and one plastic wrap. The foil looked dryed out but tasted great and the plastic had the great finished shine that said eat me. Used marshmallows and didn't have candy bar, so I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chips and the Toll House chips and one 4 oz box of German chocolate. Thats alot of  chocolate, but well worth every bite of it. People are asking if this is a family recipe or could they get it from me. Thanks for this fudge recipe

This stuff is incredibly rich!  I used only one pan because I was doing a lot of baking and was running out of pans... it came out really thick, but I will probably cut the pieces in  half once I put them out at church.

I made this fudge and took it to both my work places and took some to my family. It was such a hit! My aunt told me fudge was now my holiday responsibility and I even got a marriage proposal from one of my co-workers because of this recipe! It was really simple and fast.

I made this along with 2 other fudge recipes from this site. I was really excited for this recipe, but wasn't impressed. It is okay. Just not to die for - my grocery bill after buying everything to make this fudge did almost make me die however! ;-) I followed this recipe exactly - the directions are a little vague - but I figured it out. I wasn't sure what type of candy bar this was asking for - so I used hershey's milk chocolate. This does make a TON - I'm giving as gifts thankfully because I don't like it enough to eat it all!! By the way - the caramel peanut fudge from this site was my FAVORITE and I am sad to give it away!
UPDATE: I made this in one 9x13 pan and it was very thick - hard to cut - but worst of all it crumbled and wasn't very pretty to look at.

I made this recipe exact with no substitutions or changes.  I did not yield the same quantity.  I used one 9x13 pan with the fudge about 1 inch in height.  Very tasty but it did crumble a bit when I cut them.  I will probably not make these again and try a different recipe next year for the holidays.

This fudge flopped on me!  The sugar crystalized and it was ruined.  I followed everything on the directions  perfectly, but it just didn't seem to work for me.

This was my first time ever making fudge and despite my misgivings, it turned out quite well and was rather easy to make. The butter/milk mixture started to get gloopy and separate so I thought that the fudge would be grainy, but it set up very well and was smooth. Like another reviewer, I used only 1 pan instead of two, but it still makes a lot of fudge if you cut the squares small enough. My only complaint is that it is very, very sweet. I think that next time, I will combine unsweetened and semi-sweet chocolate instead of semi-sweet and German sweet bars. My friends really liked it, but it was too sweet for me.

A little involved with such a list of ingredients but if you need a lot of fudge (for the holidays, for instance), this is a good one.  Getting even amounts in the two pans turned out to be my biggest challenge.

This is the best and easiest chocolate fudge recipe I have ever made.  Everyone loves it and it doesn't last long.  The only change I made was I poured it in one 9x13 pan instead of two because I found it hard to separate and spread smoothly between two pans but it still tastes great.  Will definitely keep this recipe forever.

So rich and chocolately.  My son is a fudge gourmet and he gives this 10 stars!  I'm planning a batch for Valentines sharing.
