Great.  Not nearly as complicated as the recipe might suggest.  Pre-cubed the chicken and let it sit for half an hour with olive oil, salt, garlic powder, pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, and Italian herb mix - all to taste.  Started by sauteing the onion and bacon together.  Did not remove the onion and bacon, I just added the chicken to it.  After the chicken had started to cook and separate into cubes I added just enough chicken stock and about a teaspoon of tomato paste - to get all the tasty stuff off the bottom of the pan.  Once chicken was cooked I removed it to my serving platter.  I used the same frying pan, it had tasty bits stuck to the bottom again, and added the sun-dried tomato and pesto mix and spinach according to instruction.  I then added that to the chicken/bacon mixture.  Last I added about a 1/4 cup of a chianti and chicken stock mix to the pan to get the good stuff up, then poured that over the chicken as well.  I followed the rest of the directions, for the sauce, as the recipe says.  Took three pans, not six as the recipe implies.  Husband says he likes it, had seconds :-)  Enjoy.

This recipe was fantastic. I didn't make any substitutions, but I didn't add the bacon because I didn't have any. It was fabulous without it. It was so rich and creamy and full of flavor. It was a restaurant quality dish. Next time I make it I was thinking of adding some marinated artichoke hearts to it. My entire family loved it. My husband and I actually heated it up the next morning and ate it for breakfast it was that good.

We got three servings out of this recipe, which makes the fat content absurd (almost 200% DRV). If I can find an acceptable lower fat substitute for mascarpone, maybe I can salvage it. But as it stands, our arteries couldn't take another round.

Hubby's choice for his birthday dinner today.  Little bit of work, but definitely worth it.  He said this is a "gourmet meal," and we both really enjoyed it.  Added some shaved parmesan, but I think a good addition might be some toasted pine nuts on the top.  Landelah, thanks for a special meal this evening.

"It's a keeper!"  Just found it today and served it for Sunday family dinner.  I've never used mascarpone outside of dessert recipes.  All flavors melded together perfectly. I will try it for a dinner party next time.  Thank you.

I read thru the recipe and saw how many pans it needed.  I only used three.  I didn't have bacon but I did have cubed pancetta so I sautéed that in an 8 qt dutch oven, then added the onions to that.  When they were done I cooked the chicken (used boneless thighs instead) and then added everything else (up to making the sauce) right into that pot.  I used swiss chard from my garden instead of spinach.  I made the pasta and then added that to the chicken.  Kept the sauce separate at first because the chicken/pasta was wonderful on its own.  Gave everyone the option of putting the sauce on it if they wanted.  But the sauce was very good and in the end mixed everything together!  I will make this again.

I made 1/2 of the recipe for two.  It was alright. Flavour was good. For me it was too many pans for the finished product.  This will not be on my list to make again.

This was a lot of dirtying different pots for an okay recipe. It was a bit bland. Next time I think I'm going to add porcini and white mushrooms as well as some peas. Maybe white wine instead of the lemon juice.

This recipe is great.  If you're like me and don't care about  calories when making a good meal, read on.
When we made this, my girlfriend and I had been drinking for a while.  We got creative and instead of using olive oil we used the grease from cooking the bacon to saute the other items.  We also used cream cheese instead of mascarpone cheese.  This added some great flavor.  Healthy?  Hell no.  Delicious?  Absolutely!

This was very good, but very time intensive and used so many pans. Next time I will add more sun dried tomatoes as they were undetectable in the heavy sauce, and I will follow other reviewers advice about making it in fewer pans.  I  poured this into a 12 x 14 dish for serving so it would spread out a bit and you could get a bit of spinach/tomato mixture in every serving, it filled it up and we had 3/4 left after my husband and I both ate.

A lot of work, but worth it.  Great tasting.  Even a 6 years old kid approved.  Followed recipe exactly.  You can get by with only 12oz of pasta and may want to add a few ounces more of spinach.  Ended up using two skillets and two pans.  Recipe says it makes 8 servings.  More like 8 large servings.  I will be making this again.

This recipe takes a little bit of work chopping and a couple of pans but it is well worth the effort. I substituted shrimp for the chicken and bacon. Totally enjoyed.

This recipe gets 5 stars for taste.  I gave it 4 stars because of all the pans that are needed to prepare it.  The only change I made was to add a clove of minced garlic to the onion and bacon mixture, and a bit  more Parmesan cheese to the mascarpone mixture. ( We like things cheesy).  With all the pans I was using, I kept saying "this better be worth it" and it was!  My husband and son raved.  Better than most Italian restaurant meals.  Wish I knew how people prepared this with only 2 pans! Will definitely make again.  Wonderful dish for company, too.  Will not disappoint.

This recipe is just delicious, as is.  The two things I would add is that maybe 12 oz of pasta instead of 16, and the directions are a little more complicated than they need to be.  It all ends up in the same pot.

But a wonderful, wonderful meal.

This was excellent. I believe it was my first time cooking with mascarpone, which seems wonderfully versatile. The sauce tasted of a lemon-cream sauce but wasn’t too heavy at all. The bits of sun dried tomato and bacon provided unexpected bursts of flavor. I used all the ingredients called for but the amounts of some differed slightly. Used 8 slices of bacon as I had that many on hand, and just slightly over two pounds of chicken (thighs), which was plenty. I cooked the onion in just a bit of bacon grease rather than olive oil.

So good and not complicated. Used 3 pans.. one had chicken, bacon, and onion, one cooked pasta, and the third had everything else in it. Very flavorful and rich, just tons of ingredients.

I used cream cheese instead of marscapone and diced tomatoes with chilies. Also Added the bacon on top at the end to get those crunchy bites.! My girlfriend loved it! Great recipe.

Good recipe.... with  lot's of latitude to make changes to suit your own tastes.  I used linguini and omitted the basil pesto and let the sun dried tomato's shine through.  We liked this very much even the picky teenage grandchildren went back for seconds.
I particularly liked the lemon with the mascarpone.
I have never seen so many comments on how many pots and pans were used. I can suggest two things I have learned in my 75 years; Buy good pans so you will never have food stuck to hot spots and secondly, when you're finished with a pan immediately put it in the sink and fill with water.  I think best of all however is that my husband is no stranger in the kitchen he pitches in right behind me and washes up as I go along! :-)

This was delicious. The only changes I made where once the chicken was cooked i deglazed the pan with a little white wine because my marscapone sauce wasn’t quite ready and I didn’t want the chicken to dry out. I used whole wheat penne pasta because that’s what I had on hand and I mixed the spinach mixture with the chicken so my girls wouldn’t pick the spinach out ??. I also added a bit more seasoning to accommodate the taste buds if my cajun family.

Delicious!  Our whole family raved about it.  It was a bit complicated with so many steps and pans, etc. You might need a sou-chef like I have-a great hubby!

Delicious!  Definitely will be making it again.  I am not sure why reviewers complained about all the pots and pans.  I used one pot and one pan, just rinse or wipe the used one.  I fed a family of 4 including 2 teenage boys and still have leftovers.  I even cut back on the pasta some.  I did not put in the spinach because I am the only one in the house who likes it but other than that I didn't change anything and this is fabulous.  Very rich, a little goes a long way.

Tasty but rich.  Very filling and I wish I'd even used more spinach than I did.

I didn't have marscapone cheese so used creamed cottage cheese and cream cheese. Had no sundried tomatoes so roasted some cherry tomatoes in olive oil in oven. The recipe was time consuming but well worth the effort. It was delicious.

Great dish for company. I substituted cream cheese since I had no mascarpone. I highly recommend this.

This was a great recipe, the only change I made was I used orecchiette pasta instead of the bow tie.  It’s what I had on hand.  To minimize the pan usage I cooked the bacon,
Removed and then cooked the onion. Then added the  bacon pesto and tomatoes.  I had precooked my chicken and added that. The cheese mixture I added next, mixed it all together, with the pasta.
Was a very pretty presentation with the spinach (will add more spinach next time) tomatoes.  The pesto added great flavor.

I used a pound of bacon and added chopped parsnip with the onions since I had it. I think other vegetables could also be added with the onions to make it healthier. I substituted 1 pound of ground turkey for the chicken. I did not have sundries tomatoes. This is a delicious recipes and a great dish for dinner. My family devoured it and had seconds!

As the meal was made for two the proportions did not easily divide so I ended up with less tomatoes than I wanted but more cheese and pasta. Will definitely try this again with more tomatoes and bacon.  We both loved it though.

I'm always looking for new taste combos and this is one.  Mildly complex but worth it.  I followed PanFishWife's suggestions somewhat.  This is a keeper.

Delicious!. Cut back on lemon juice because my kids don't really like it. Didn't have sun dried tomatoes so I used tomato sauce and low fat milk. Came out great! Will make it again and follow recipe.
