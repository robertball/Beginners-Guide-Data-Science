Not a bad recipe. I substituted the milk and honey with orange juice. Then I left the bananas out. Also, the nutmeg was a tinge too strong so I left that out too. I found I didn't need to blend the mixture. MMMMMM nothing like orange juice! heheh
Seriously, what works well with this recipe is an ounce of Kaluah. Can you tell I've already had a glass?

Great for a quick and easy breakfast! I froze my banana and cut the milk back to one cup. I used 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon and added just a pinch of nutmeg. Overall, very good.

Did exactly as the recipe calls for and my kids loved it.  Son asked since it was made w/ milk could he have it w/ dinner.  (I said yes :0))  Lots of carbs, so it's great to have in the am. It'll keep them from snacking on junk food and it's healthy.

Good taste, just not smoothie consistency.  I only used about 1/2 cup soy milk and it was still too liquidy.  Maybe I'll add more banana or crushed ice next time. I also used cinnamon instead of nutmeg.

This was pretty good, I've never had much luck with homemade smoothies, and this turned out yummy.  It was an awful big serving for one, (and didn't refrigerate well) so I will cut the milk in 1/2 next time.  I've got a new breakfast knack!  Thanks Anna!!

This recipe was pretty good. I love banana, and I was looking for a good, healthy smoothie. This almost met my expectations. It wasn't cold enough and it tasted a little funny because it was a tad warm. A few ice cubes solved this problem. I am also not a very big fan of nutmeg, and so after it was done I added some cinnamon to override the nutmeg. The aftertaste wasn't great. I used maple syrup instead of the honey. Will try again, differently.

Yum!  This is simple and here is what it tastes like - eggnog.  (In my opinion.)  The nutmeg and honey are great.  Be warned, it is more or less the consistency of eggnog too...not what some people would call a smoothie (as others noted)...but I loved it.  You could add some ice (just a bit), freeze the banana, or add extra banana to thicken it.  Give it a go anyhow, you have about 4 ingredients to waste :-p

This was YUMMY! I made a double batch and used only 2 cups of milk instead of 3. Also, I used y Cinnomon Plus from Pampered Chef instead of the nutmeg. It turned out great!

This was good, however, I didn't add any honey, as the banana is certainly sweet enough. I cut down on the milk and added O.J. Feel free to put in any kind of fruit you want. Strawberries, peaches, blueberries or raspberries are a wonderful addition. What a quick and yummy way to get in so much nutrition!

I make this recipe all the time, although I have modified it a bit: I use 5 ice cubes, reduce the milk to 3/4 cup, and reduce the nutmeg to 1/8 tsp.  Delicious!

This had too much nutmeg for me - It added so much bitterness that I couldn't seem to get the mixture sweet enough, despite having very ripe bananas, putting in extra honey, and adding some confectioner's sugar as previous reviews suggested.

What a delicious and healthy dessert or snack!  Who needs ice cream?!?  You don't miss it!  I substituted some of the milk with orange/pineapple juice, omitted the nutmeg, and added some ice cubes.  The blender did all the work.  I don't particularly like to EAT bananas, but I LOVE them in a drink!

This was so great!  My husband whipped them up, and added about 1/8 cup powdered sugar....bananas were a little bitter...and it was perfect!  Will use again and again.  My 7 year old didn't like it much, but he's not fond of bananas.  Can't wait to have my girls try it...they love bananas!

Great.  It reminded me of the banana smoothies my mom used to make for me.  I added ice to thicken it a bit.  And I thought it was a little bitter so I added some vanilla.  The nutmeg was a bit strong so I'll add a tad less next time.  Maybe I'll have it  again for breakfast tomorrow :)

This was a great quick snack.  I made mine extra special with vanilla soy milk.  I highly recommend this to everyone.  It's so simple and versatile, you can add whatever fruit and spices to it.  Enjoy!!!

This was SO good!  I made a few changes, but not many.  I used 3/4 cup of soy milk, about a tsp of vanilla, and then the banana, honey and nutmeg. Blended it all together, then I added some ice cubes. When I tasted it, it blew my mind how much flavor was in it!  Great recipe.

I doubled this recipe as I had two bananas that were ripe and ready for this recipe.  I left out the nutmeg and added one cup of crushed ice (for the doubled recipe) and it was a hit!  I will be making this one again.  Super easy!

It was good as-is, but I wanted to add cinnamon and vanilla.  I liked it a lot more that way.  I also used almond milk.

Very tasty, and I personally liked the more drinkeable texture.  Well-balanced, and loved the simplicity that allowed the  drink to really shine.  This was a smoothie that is truly wholesome, not just masquerading as a healthy drink.

try using frozen bananas.  Freeze them when VERY RIPE (Lots of brown spots). Peal then cut into pieces first and freeze on a cookie sheet then move to a ziploc bag.  That way they are easy to access and blend well in the blender.  I make mine with just frozen ripe bananas and milk (and maybe some cardamom once in a while).  I use enough bananas so its thick like a milkshake.  So healthy, but you'd not even know it!

I am drinking this as I rate it and its SUPER -  I took earlier suggestions and froze the bananas;  only used  1 cup of Milk; add about 1 teaspoon cinnamon, maybe little more; and then threw in some wheat germ.  Sprinkled on top nutmeg and cinn.  too.  We love it.

My 16 month old LOVES this recipe.   He has it EVERY morning and drinks the whole recipe by himself.  Most of the time we don't add the nutmeg.  Thank goodness my 4 year old doesn't care!
It is an excellent substitute if you are trying to wean!

Made this and while i like the taste I plan on using frozen banana chucks next time so its texture is less runny and more like a milkshake.  I love that it uses easy and healthful ingredients.

For a thicker smoothie, cut your banana into chunks and throw it in the freezer the day before. The banana "ice cubes" blend nicely!

And if calories aren't an issue, sub. in some vanilla ice cream. ;-)

Very tasty. I threw in a little granola for some texture. The description said smoothie so I was expecting it to be thicker. I would have given more stars if it was thicker like a smoothie, but the taste is an AAA+++

I probably make more banana smoothies than anyone you have ever met.  I think this recipe tastes a whole lot better with ice.  The only other thing I changed was to use soy milk instead of milk.  This recipe was worth a try because I usually don't put nutmeg in my smoothies and I thought it tasted great with the banana. I will use this again.  Thanks!

It was great, but the fact that I could not taste the honey or sweetness caused me to add lots of sugar and lots of ice too, to make it colder.

Great way to use expiring bananas. I also add cinnamon and nutmeg (to taste), as well as a few ice cubes and, when available, fat-free whipped topping to give it a light, fluffy texture. Very good - thanks!

We didn't have any nutmeg so we used cinnamon. Also we added honey greek yogurt so it wouldn't be too thin and we added a bit of kale. Overall the smoothie was delicious. Next time we will add ice or we will freeze the banana to make it colder. :)

Tastes good, but a lot runnier than I was expecting. I guess I should have read the other reviews first. If I make this again, I'll use less milk.

I made this with only 1 cup milk and it was delicious.  I think with 1.5 cups it would be too thin and milky rather than thick and filling.  I also used pumpkin pie spice because I couldn't find my nutmeg.  This was delicious!  I'm sure it tastes amazing as written, but I made little variations to my taste.  My 2 and 5 year old scarfed this stuff.

Nothing overly special about this recipe... the nutmeg was a nice added touch but I thought it was a bit warm but that is easily fixed wtih a frozen banana or a few ice cubes.. quick and easy though... and tastes decent...

This recipe was pretty good, although I did alter it.  I used two frozen bananas, 1 1/2 tbsp honey and reduced the milk to 1 cup (i left the nutmeg the same).  The result was one deliciously thick, sweet banana smoothie/milkshake - tasted just like ice cream, but much healthier!

Quick drink to whip up to accompany the "Breakfast for Dinner". 

Kids were "eh" about it, but I liked it.
I added a little frozen yogurt to make it a little thicker.

I made this for my young son.We thought it was just OK. Next time will not add nutmeg because he did not care for the taste.Also I only used about a cup of milk .It calls for way to much milk

This was delicious.  Made it just as stated and I would not change a thing.  Our 3 year old gulped it down.  Always looking for other ways to incorporate fruit in the diet.  Thanks a bunch.

The original recipe looked like way too much milk, so I used 2/3 of a cup of milk, and I also added in a dash of cinnamon. The consistency with just 2/3 of a cup was more on the liquid side (which I like), so if you like thicker smoothies I'd suggest using maybe 1/2 a cup. 
This smoothie tasted amazing, the nutmeg really pulled it all together, and I would definitely make it again.

We added a bit of cinnamon and vanilla. About a 1/4tsp of cinnamon per banana and 1/8tsp of vanilla. I have to make batches for 6 kids and myself, so a 4 banana batch was just right

Loved this. Usually have a hard time finishing smoothies , but not this one. Substituted coconut almond milk for regular milk, and switched nutmeg for a drop of vanilla and a half teaspoon of cocoa powder (any chocolate syrup would do too). Also used two bananas instead of one (love bananas). This is one I'll cautiously make again and again (so i don't overdose :-)  )

Reminiscent of eggnog.  Next time I may replace 1/2 cup milk with ice, or just add ice, to chill it more, Or freeze the banana.  Second batch I made added 1/2 tsp cinnamon for a spicier flavor.

It is very good I added a scoop of protein & made it a protein shake.  Next time I'm gonna freeze my banana that's a good idea.

I loved this! I just found out I am pregnant so I should be drinking more milk and the banana helps with the nausea. I'm not a fan of thick banana drinks so the consistency was perfect. I used a pinch of cinnamon instead of the nutmeg to suit my personal preference. If you are pregnant make sure to use pasteurized honey. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy and inexpensive smoothie! I didn't have nutmeg, so I used cinnamon and it was tasty. Added some ice cubes to thicken. The 4yr old loved it. Great way to get the kids to eat healthy!

I thought this was runny and not enough banana flavor.  I added another banana and ice to thicken it up but it still wasn't what I was hoping for .

I used a frozen banana and 1 cup of milk to make it thicker. The first time I made this I kept the nutmeg amount the same but I found the flavour too strong so the second time I cut the nutmeg in half and it was so much better. I think I might add a little bit of sugar next time too just to sweeten it up a bit more, although I hesitate to make this recipe less healthy...

I only needed to use 1/2C of milk and it was still pretty thin.  Added some strawberries too and a little extra honey.  Some crushed ice helped keep it cold.  Still kind of bland.

This was so good! I used pumpkin pie spice because I had no nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice has nutmeg in it. I might use a little less milk next time for personal preferance. I used my immersion blender and this was done in seconds and I didn't have to take my blender apart to clean it! As the reviewer Karl Fish said this is also great with kahlua. Of course it's not as healthy that way! Thanks for a great and simple recipe!

Nutmeg makes a great twist...WE make LOTS of smoothies here.  For more of a "treat" when making smoothies, we use frozen fruit.  Freezing fresh bananas is easy, I just peel them, cut them up and pop them into a freezer bag (flat so they dont freeze together) and take a couple out for smoothies.  This would make this smoothie nice and thick.  

We also use VERY VANILLA silk soy milk, which is healthy, and sweet enough that you need not add any extra sweeteners.  My family doenst even like soy milk (besides me) and they'd never even know it was soy in my smoothies.

Also.....for added nutrition....adding a tablespoon or two of wheat germ makes for a great texture, and its yummy too!!!!
