We added some tomato sauce and this recipe turned out really well.  Particularly for those who don't do spicy foods well, or for young children who don't need spicy foods yet. We really enjoyed this chili.

Loved it and so did my family. The only changes I made was I seasoned my ground beef before cooking with salt, pepper, garlic salt, red pepper flakes, and paprika. I added sour cream, cheddar cheese, and chives to the final dish. It was delicious!!

Very good! I made a few basic changes. I seasoned my ground beef when cooking it, added half a can of broccoli and cheese soup, and threw in half a package of rotini pasta to the mix. Turned out very flavourful for me, like homemade Hamburger Helper! Easy to make and will definitely be a favourite recipe of mine.

This was ok for trying to make something fast for lunch.  Added extra seasonings, along with onion, garlic etc., but the flavors just didn't have time to blend in thirty minutes.  Thanks for the post.

Basic but quick and easy. Definitely  enhance it with your own seasonings and toppings. I also added tomato sauce, diced onion, cumin, green chiles.

Like the other reviews suggested, I used this recipe as a base for my own Chili.  I added ground red pepper, hot sauce, broccoli and cheese soup, and some spices. It stirred up quick and tastes great!

I added chopped onion and garlic to this and also provided cheese to sprinkle on top after it was served in a bowl.  Maybe I did something wrong, but I would have liked a thicker chili.  Also, it just wasn't spectacular.  Good, and I'd eat it again, but not something that is amazing.

Very fast and extremely easy with good results. Doubled the recipe to feed a larger crowd this evening. I used very lean ground beef, stewed tomatoes and my own taco seasoning and served it over pasta to make a "chili-mac" kind of thing and it went over very well. Served with corn bread and a salad and everyone was happy and satisfied. Great dinner for a busy day. Thanks for sharing.

True, this makes a good, quick chili as is, hence the 4*. But for me, what makes it a 5* recipe is subbing black beans for the kidney beans (juice and all) and---most importantly---throwing in a 15-oz. can of Bush's baked beans, which extends the meal and adds a nice hint of sweetness. You can also add 1/2-can of water if you like your chili a little thinner. This has been my go-to chili recipe for over 15 years, and everyone begs me for the recipe. (Lawry's is our personal favorite packaged seasoning.)

Great recipe! This was incredibly easy to make and inexpensive. I would have preferred to have bought organic, grass-fed, antiobiotic-free beef, but I didn't have the $. Instead of using pre-made chili seasoning mix, I just used my own mixture of cayenne pepper, cajun seasoning, salt, and pepper.  I'll be having it with homemade cornbread tomorrow night! And maybe some collard greens. Thanks!

This is a good chili for kids - mild with a lot of beans.  I personally do not like chili that has more beans then beef which this recipe does.

Very quick and easy. There wasn't enough liquid for us, so I added a 1/2 can of beef broth. Also, the diced tomatoes had green chiles and onions. Added a dollop of sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese  and served with cornbread. My son and I loved it. My husband liked it.

This was my first time making chili and I have to say, it was great. I did a little tweaking on it to make it my own and voila, it's chili! With just a shake or two of chipotle and some cayenne it is fit for my fire loving family.

All I can say is yes yes yes! I use turkey instead of ground meat and it always hits the spot.  A great dish to make after a long day at work when you want something quick and easy to make.

This was really good. I am a chili lover and I enjoyed the fact that it didn't take 3 hours to prepare and cook. Simple and delicious. Just add your own spices and voila! A yummy dinner for your family.

It was ok. It was very easy. Very quick to make. If I were to make it again I would probably add some peppers in it to bring out the flavor :)

Real basic recipe but good start to work from. I substituted the ground beef for hot italian sausage. It tasted great. I also added a lot of spices , garlic and onion. In the end it was quick to make and tasted great. I think without adding stuff though it would be quite bland.

I got this same recipe from a friend and have made it several times.  It always turns out great.  The only things I did a little different were I didn't drain the kidney beans...just dumped them in with the juice.  I also found a can of diced tomatoes chili ready which had chili seasonings and onions in it.  Since the tomatoes already had chili seasonings, I used a package of chili seasoning mix labled as "Original" rather than "Hot".  My daughter doesn't like chili that's real spicy and she loves this recipe.

this was alright. I know it looks bad in the photo. but it wasnt THAT terrible tasting. i just found it a little to "prepackaged" tasting and probably will not make it again. but then again what can you expect, it did come from a packet mostly.

I added extra can of beans and chilli powder. Can of tomato sauce, and a pinch of V8 juice (should have used Spicy V8). Turned out pretty good except a little too sweet. I will make it again, but try to unsweeten it next time.

You can find pretty much the same recipe on the back of that chili seasoning mix, so unoriginal.

This is a great starter recipe, but let's get real.  It's just the directions off the back of the chili seasoning package.

I had family come over at the last minute, and decided to make this recipe to feed everyone!!  We didn't expect much from it, but it tasted good and was very fast and VERY easy.  We filled everyone up and didn't have any complaints.  We added cheese and fritos chips and made cornbread at the same time - it was a great meal to feed lots of people quickly!!

Solid Chili. I would actually KEEP and cook with the packing water from both the kidney beans and tomatoes as this will prevent the dish from becoming too dry when using lean meats.

I made this as directed, but used Ground Turkey instead of Ground Beef.  My daughter and I loved it.  For her's, I sprinkled some Mexican blend shreaded cheese on top and melted for 30 seconds in the microwave.  She is not a tomato or bean fan, but she loved this, so I'm very happy!

Super easy to make, I used chili powder and added onions, garlic, salt and pepper to the mix, topping it with cheddar and sour cream.  Yum!

Needs additional seasoning...added 1T soy sauce, garlic salt to taste.  I think cooking meat with seasoning might help didn't see that - good quick chili recipe though!

This is very simple and easy to make recipe. I  substituted Johnsonville's ground sausage in place of the ground beef and I think that really made this super yummy! This recipe only uses 4 ingredients but you could always add more to it. I added some chopped onions and topped with some shredded cheese.  A good recipe to keep handy on those busy nights when you want a hot comforting meal to put on the table in hurry.

Really great chilli but needs a little something extra.
