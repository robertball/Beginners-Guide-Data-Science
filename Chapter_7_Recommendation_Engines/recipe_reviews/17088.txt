I am always asked to make this dip for office parties; the recipe I use also includes a layer of salsa on top of the hormel chili, but only one package of cream cheese. This is quick, easy, and delicious.

I have been doing this recipe for a few years now, ever since my friend did it at a party.  She used black beans, but I prefer chili.  A little variation I do on this, I add cut up green onions to the top and I bake it in the oven for about 20-25 mins on 325.  I think baking it makes it less greasy.  This is a great dip and everyone always loves it!!

I have made this dip for years.  I make mine with Hormel Chili WITH beans, I don't like it without the beans (tried it once cause I couldn't find my normal ingredient)....I also don't use that much cream cheese, 1 8oz block is plenty.  This dip looks nasty...lol...but it is always requested and now all my friends have it at their own parties...I have NEVER seen any leftovers.

I used a 7x11 baking dish and also baked in the oven at 325 for 20 minutes instead of using the microwave.  If you want something quick and easy and tastes good, this is a good dish to make!

I originally adopted this recipe from a friend of mine. The ingredients are similar, except we use 1 can of chili for every package of cream cheese.  We also add a jar of jalapeno peppers and a tsp cumin and chili pepper.
****A tip for tastier chips***  Typically instead of purchasing regular tortilla chips, I learned from a gf that you can achieve a restaurant style chip by purchasing tortilla shells (like burrito shells) at your supermarket. Make sure they are the Mexican version because regular ones will be crackly and very oily. Cut them in the desired size, and fry them in oil until lightly brown.

Very good! At first, I thought that cream cheese wouldn't be good in this, but it was perfect. Just like sour cream. Makes quit a bit! I used a 19 oz can of chili instead of the suggested 15 oz. And also used a 12 oz of shredded cheese instead of the 16 oz. Turned out perfect. Neext time, I'll add green onions and salsa. I will make this again.

People were scraping the sides of the crock pot for more - no kidding!  Night before, I cooked on stove 2 cans of Stag steak chili(with beans) incorporating the cream cheese until well mixed, took off the heat and added 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar cheese and put away.  Next day I put all in a 1 1/2 qt crock pot with a bit of water to keep it from getting to thick, topped with some more shredded cheese and green onion for garnish and served at with Frito scoops and blue corn tortilla chips.

When I made this recipe I was not sure how well I was going to like it.  At first I thought it was not good and not much was eaten.  I put it in the refrigerator and it has dissappeared.  I tried it again and it is much better the second day.

MMMMmmmm...We had this for dinner the other night =).  I will definately try the green onion/salsa suggestion as well as the baking - while the 5 minutes in the microwave was so tempting, the chili did get slightly greasy, and did cool down quickly.  Ate this with Torengos which were good.  While making this for dinner, we also made 2 small tupperwares of this for lunch the next day (with flour tortillas)- could NOT be easier!!!!!

Average...although me daughter liked this.  Personally, I did not like the canned chili in this recipe.  To try the recipe out I scaled down to 7 servings, added chopped pepperoni tomatoes after heating.  If I were to make this again, I would use my own chili.

I've been making this dip for years and it's a hit at every potluck or party.  My variation is to mix in thick & chunky salsa with the chili before spreading it over the cream cheese. You can adjust for your own taste/heat quotient.  Fritos Scoops are great for tasting every layer in one bite!  Leftovers are also great spooned into flour tortillas and microwaved!

I've also been making this recipe for years, and it's great!!! It's a huge hit with all my friends, coworkers, and family. We call it "macho nacho" dip! 
I use 1 cream cheese, 1 can chili no beans, and whatever mexican/cheddar shredded cheese I have, with unflavored tortilla chips. 
The low-fat cream cheese doesn't have quite as good of a texture, but it's not bad. 
I always do it in the oven - microwave doesn't get the cheese on top brown & bubbly! :-)
If making for people you know like beans, chili w/ beans is great, but for potlucks/parties, I've found most people do NOT like beans!

This recipe is easy and good, but I could literally feel myself getting fatter with every bite. Before it was finished, we had to cover it up so we couldn't see it.

I threw all the ingredients for this into my small "Little Dipper" crockpot early this morning, only using the chili I made last night (with black beans) instead of canned beans. I also used reduced fat cream cheese. My three men are already dipping into it and drooling over my countertop. Great weekend treat!

Loved it! Altered it a bit though--2 cans chili(1 w/beans, 1 w/o), and I used Mexican cheese.  I mixed the cream cheese with the chili and then stirred in one bag of the cheese.  Topped it with the other bag of cheese.  Delicious!

Love this dip and its great for get-togethers! I usually put mine in the oven at 250 for ten minutes or until the cheese is melted and the chili starts to bubble. I also use mozzarealla shredded cheese and serve with Frito's big scoops. There's never any left by the end of the night!

This was runny until I made my boyfriend go the store to get another can of chili. Once the second can was added, it wasn't bad. Also, I used the taco-blend cheese (and a little more of it) and added a can of diced green chiles for come kick. Now the taste got even better! Since I'm not a fan of those hormel canned chili, which is what I used, I might try this recipe again with my own leftover, homemade chili and see if there is even additional improvement. It's a good basic to start with though!

I received a similar recipe from a friend of mine.  The only difference is that she mixes salsa with the chili and sprinkles the top with jalapeno peppers.  It's sooooooo good!!!  We have a name for it, but I don't think it's appropriate to say what it is on this forum.  ;)  Try it, you'll love it!

Wonderful recipe, and quick to make. Because origionally the dip, I thought, was too thick, I added a bit of sour cream to make it easier to eat with chips. Wonderful recipe!

I have a co-worker who makes this recipe all the time for our office parties.  This is a delicious recipe.  I finally made it at home tonight but I also made white rice,black beans and tortilla chips on the side.  This made it feel more like a dinner rather than a snack.  We had a delicious, quick dinner.

Simple recipe to make. I alter the recipe just a little. I used leftover homemade chili from the freezer. I layered the chili first then cut the cream cheeze in chunks. Put in the oven 'til cream cheese started to melt a little. Stirred and then added shredded cheese on top. Placed in the oven for a few more minutes (tastes better in oven) wah-lah it's done. I've made it both ways with canned chili and homemade, if you are in a hurry canned is excellent, also. Homemade just adds a little zing to it. I like mine spicy so I add a little more seasoning to the canned, as to where my chili is already spiced up. Great any way you make it. I like using Scoopable chips.

Great to serve at a BBQ.  Like other reviewers I used Chili with beans---I just mashed it with a potato masher before adding.  Adding the diced green onions also adds a nice flavour.  I have no idea what FRITO SCOOPS are, so I served it with TOSTITO corn chips.  Yummy!

I have used this recipe on many occasions, though I generally use only 1 8-oz. package of cream cheese and only 8-10 ounces of the grated cheddar with the 15-oz. can of Chili without beans.  I serve it with white corn tortilla chips or scoops.  This is my preference, only because we always have large, family/friend get togethers, and there are tons of appetizers; so we all take smaller portions.  ALL of my Latino friends love it - no matter what country they're from, as do my American family members.  So that indication to me that THIS 5-star rating is not overdone -- as so many online ratings are!

I also have made this ever since my sister told me about it. We only use one block of cream cheese as well. It fits perfectly in a pie plate. And we use scoops chips because they make it easier to dig into the dip. Love this recipe!!!!

Good. I only had one 8oz package of cream cheese so this is all I used. I also jazzed it up by adding onion and garlic powder and chopped jalapenos. Topped the finish product with green onions.  This is good stuff.

This is delicious!  Hubby requests it all the time, especially during football season.  Instead of microwaving, I bake it for about 20 minutes at 300, and sometimes add chopped green onion if I have it.  We also prefer to eat it with Fritos Scoops...amazing!

Super easy recipe and great tasting.  I added a few chunks of salsa on top of the chili before melting the cheese to add some extra flavor.  Overall, a hit at the New Years party, especially with the guys!

Was okay, definitely not great. I'd half the cream cheese and cheddar. Much better consistency if the chili and cream cheese are blended together instead of layered. Other similar recipes call for a can of diced green chiles. This may jazz it up a bit.

Good, and we ate the whole pan. Although if I made this again. I would simply mix the cream cheese and chili together for a more blended flavor. Also, I halved the recipe, but I think you could 1/2 the cream cheese and use the whole amt of chili and still be ok. Used fritos scoops...yum!

I've made this before, but only half the cream cheese and baked in the oven.  I've also made it WITH beans, but unless you know your 'audience', I'd suggest without.  Some wouldn't touch it with the beans included!

I am making this again for football snacks this Sunday.  I think this is best made with your own leftover homemade chili then it is just as good the first day as the second day.  I also bake mine; I just like the cheese to get slightly browned.  I have made this with a Monterey Jack and cheddar mixture, very good.  Spreading a little sour cream over the chili before topping with cheese is also good.

This super fast chili cheese dip is the best!If you are tired of the old cheese and salsa, give this dip a try. I serve it with Fritos scoops. It disappears quickly so make sure you have plenty for second on hand.  YUM!YUM!

Nothing special except that it was easy to make.  We served it with fritos.  I modified slightly and used 1 (8oz) cream cheese and 1 (8oz) sharp cheddar.  It was then baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes covered with tin foil and 5 more minutes without.

It was like my sister in law made it.   I found her recipe without asking her.  However it was really good!!   We like it.    I thought the recipe had to much cheddar cheese 16oz was too much.   I'm glad I only used 8oz an maybe a little extra cheese an not the entire 16oz.   Otherwise it was great!!

So easy and so good!  I now keep these ingredients on hand in case we get a snack attack.  I have kept this dip warm in a crock pot before and that worked well, although you have to keep stirring as the cheese can become seprated and greasy.  I also add some chopped green onions on top for color.

I also prefer baking over microwave. It's a much more even heat, and the cream cheese melts into the chili... who wants clumps of cream cheese on the bottom?? And for a nice variation, put a layer of salsa over the chili before adding the cheese.

This was the easiest and best tasting dip. YUM. Everyone at the party tore it up. I saw someone suggested Frito scoops and they were so good with it. I will always make this for parties now.

This was ok, but nothing special.  Too much cheddar cheese and once it was melted it was very greasy.  It was kind of bland, and we probably won't make it again.

I used fat free refried beans in this recipe to cut down on the fat content.  It was good but I bet using the chili would add a lot more flavor.  I also put whole black beans on top since they're my favorite.  Will definitely use this recipe again!

So deceptive in it's simplicity, this dip is the favorite of my children.  It's just as great using refried beans in place of the chili.  In our house, Frito scoops are a MUST for this dip!

I wasn't so crazy about this but wow did the guys ever go for it.  I think this might of been better for me if I had mixed it all up instead of layering it.  And the cheese.......omg....I can't even imagine putting the whole 16 oz. of cheese on top of this....it made too much of a cheese crust and I only used 8 oz. of cheese.  If I made this again I might try mixing it all up.  Oh - I baked mine instead of microwaving it.  Thanks Kathy!

This was soooo easy to make. I took it to a cookout and the bowl was wiped out in minutes. I did add some sour cream to the cream cheese and salsa to spice it up. Definitely a keeper. Some people put the dip on their hotdogs and absolutely loved it. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was great.  Everyone loved it, about 25 people.  I made a few changes.  I only used 8 oz. cream cheese and 8 oz. colby jack cheese. I used turkey chili with beans. I also heated it on the stove.  It was just right, more cheeses would have been too much.

This is OK for a quick snack.  Would be somewhat better with a homemade chili, but I'm still not sure I'd make it again.

I use one package cream cheese, spread into bottom of 8x8 glass pan. Cover with a full tin of Stagg Dynamite Chili (with beans). Cover with grated cheese. Decorate the top with: chopped red peppers, green onions, black olives, pickled or raw jalapeños, your choice. Or none at all. Bake in oven at 350 for 20-30 minutes. It will disappear! A great dish to take to a happy hour or party.  Never fails! Been making it for years!

Like so many others, I have been making this for years. I use just 1 package of cream cheese. I also mix some sliced green and black olives into the chili before putting it on the cream cheese layer. I have tried both baking and microwaving this tasty dip and definitely prefer the baking method-325 degrees for 20-25 minutes. My family likes the "layered-effect, rather than mixing the chili and cream cheese together.

I like it.  I did receive some compliments.  But others said it had too much cream cheese.  I tend to agree.  Next time will use less cream cheese and add some seasoning.

only given 4 stars as some one says to use aluminum foil to make clean up easier.  If you do that you will start a fire in your microwave and possibly ruin the microwave.  To make a easier cleanup please use parchment instead of the aluminum foil.  You won't run the risk of a fire or ruining the microwave.  The recipe though is very tasty.

I bought the chili sauce instead of canned chili by mistake and it was still amazing!

I didn't exactly follow the recipe to the T.  However, I put the cream cheese on the bottom, layered with my own chili and topped with nacho cheese dip from this site.  The ingredient combo was perfect!!

First time I served it I followed the recipe exactly. It didn't taste to well and one couple thought it was baked beans. The next time I made it I mixed it all together and it was nearly gone.

Add a can green chilies and bake instead at *325 for 20 minutes. Then I'd give 5 stars.

This is an oldie but Goodie, I've made it for 20 yrs. hormel has 1/3  less fat than Wolf brand canned chili!
I like the idea of chopped green onions in the cream cheese.  I bake in 10" glass pie pan in oven 325 til all melts and serve with crackers.  Simple and always eaten up!

I have made a similar recipe to this for many years. It is excellant if you add a small can of diced green chillis spread between the cream cheese and chilli layer. Also add some chopped green onions on top. I always use Hormel chilli with no beans....(no substitutes)

This is really good. I use Monterey Jack Chesse instead of the Cheddar Cheese. Will definitely be making this quite a bit. Thanks for sharing your recipe.
