Added 20 oz crushed pineapple and the whole 8 oz whipped topping container as many sugested. I took this to a baby shower and as soon as i put it on the table i saw someone else had brought one also. I was a little dissapointed about that BUT as i saw more and more people going to my bowl over and over and saying "whatever this is, it's good!" i knew the bowl was going to be empty soon. When we cleaned up at the end of the shower , my bowl was in fact empty and the other lady's was almost full. I felt a little bad about that, but hey, if it's better what can you do? LOVE the nuts in it!

This is a good recipe that needs some modifications. To get the pineapple to pudding mix ration right, I make it with a 20 ounce can of fruit with two boxes of pudding, adding double the whipped cream. Sometimes it is good to add coconut as well.

Easy and so good!  I would add more pineapple than called for - I used a 20-oz. can of (unsweetened) pineapple chunks.  The second time I made this, I wanted to make it less soupy (adding all the juice was just too much liquid), so I drained the entire 20-oz. can of pineapple (chunks) into a measuring cup, then added 1/2 cup juice to the pudding.  Letting it sit overnight is key, as it will taste too much like unprepared pudding if you don't.  I used pecans instead of walnuts, and cut down on the amount (used 1/4 cup instead of 1/2), and would do that again.  I also used the entire 8-oz. tub of whipped topping.  Thanks for the recipe!

I changed it a bit, and it came out awesome, I had tons of requests at a baby shower for this recipe.  Here it is.....2 (3.4 oz) packages of instant pistachio pudding, 2 (20oz) cans of crushed pineapple, drained (1/4 cup reserved juice), 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, 1(16 oz) cool whip, thawed.  Fold all ingredients into the cool whip and chill for several hours.  Yum!!

Took to a potluck.  Changes:  20oz can of pineapple. Drained juice into large bowl, beat together with 4oz cream cheese and pudding mix.  Folded in whole container of French Vanilla CoolWhip.  Added pineapple, strawberries, mandarin oranges, marshmallows and pecans instead of walnuts.

This recipe calls for the juice, we hated this and it looked sloppy. The next time I made it I drained the pineapples a couple of times to make sure there was NO juice. It came out very fluffy and quite nice looking.

This is one of those homey recipes that FEELS like a family tradition, even if you've just tried it for the first time!  I prefer with finely chopped pecans, as walnuts can have a slightly bitter edge to them.  Super fluffy goodness in a spoon!!

I really enjoyed this salad.  It's a shame pistachio pudding isn't given as much publicity as other flavors because it makes for a wonderful dessert.  I added some cottage cheese to mine for extra texture and calcium.  You really can't taste it, but it was a nice addition.  I've made a recipe similar to this using peach gelatin in place of the pistachio and adding drained sliced peaches.  Ohhh so good!  Will make this again.  Thanks Jennifer.

A festive sweet treat! I made this with Thanksgiving dinner. It looked and tasted great. I added some fruit cocktail with cherries to give it more of a fruit presence and for the color of the cherries. It was super.

Okay, here's what you'll need to do to achieve the 5 star status I've given this one... DEFINITELY use a 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple, (I'm REALLY thinking the 8 oz. stated here is a misprint!)... also, be sure to use the entire 8 oz. container of Cool Whip rather than just half of it, (perhaps ANOTHER misprint???)... I wanted it to have a bit more substance, so I added a 15 oz. can of fruit cocktail, drained, and I'm really glad I did. Make sure to allow enough time for this to chill in the fridge before serving... I'd say at least 6 hours, but overnight would be even better. This is light and creamy & not overly sweet... a GREAT dessert for summertime!

This is an old recipe frequently brought to church potlucks and found in church cookbooks.  But someone at AllRecipes, please fix the ingredients!  You must use a 16-20 oz. can of crushed pineapple and an entire tub of Cool Whip.  Also, unless you really, really like the taste of pistacio pudding, only one (4 serving size) box is needed.  When made correctly, this is a refreshingly yummy dish; however, I'm giving the recipe as written 3 stars.

Made this twice.   As written, it was a 3 star dish. 
Made with the following changes recommended by my grandmother's original recipe it was 5 star.   When I served it, she begged me to use her recipe and not this one, so I obliged. 

1 small box INSTANT pistachio pudding - (do not make into pudding)  
1  20oz pineapple in juice, NOT SYRUP drain off juice by 50% 
1/2 cup chopped pistachios 
1 1/2 cups minature marshmallows. 
1-2 drops of green food coloring if desired 
1 - 8oz tub cool whip 

Mix all ingredients together, FOLD in cool whip last and refrigerate for at least 6-8 hours before serving.

LOVE this stuff! this recipe has been around for years. The only things I do differently is use a 20 ounce can of crushed pineapple and combine the juice with the dry pudding mix before adding the other ingredients to make sure it all dissolves. Oh yeah, I would just use the whole container of cool whip also to cut down on the richness and make it go farther at a buffet!!

I use sugar free pudding and sugar free cool whip for a diabetic friendly recipe.  The pineapple and marshmallows still have sugar in them, but it cuts the sugar by more than half!!

OH MY....THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE.  OF COURSE I ALWAYS DOUBLE IT TO MAKE ENOUGH TO LAST A COUPLE OF DAYS.  ONE BATCH IS NOT ENOUGH FOR MORE THAN TWO.  BUT MY FIANCE' LOVES THIS DESSERT.  I HAVE MADE A LOT OF DISHES FOR HIM FROM THIS SITE, BUT THIS IS BY FAR HIS FAVORITE.  YOU CAN ADD CHERRIES TO THIS RECIPE IF YOU LIKE THEM, GIVES THE DISH A LITTLE COLOR.

my mom made this every holiday and called it pistacio pudding. She didn't add nuts; however, I do endorse the addition of some type of finely chopped nuts. We also never added the marshmallows so for those who don't appreciate the added sweet, you won't notice the absence of those.  i would also support draining the crushed pineapple to avoid soupyness.  
The major difference in my mom's recipe would be the addition of minced maraschino cherries. For me this is a key ingredient. All in all...no holiday dinner is complete without this pudding/salad.

Like others, I used an entire 20oz of crushed pineapple, but I reserved a 1/2 a cup of pineapple juice first, then just dumped the rest in. I didn't use walnuts---pecans instead. And I used the whole 8oz of whipped cream. Yum!

I used a 20-ounce can of crushed pineapple (I drained as much liquid off as I could with the lid, which proved to be the PERFECT amount to leave out -- definitely don't need all that liquid!) and a full 8-ounce container of whipped topping. And it's awesome. I thought it would make more than it did. If you plan to take this to a potluck or party, definitely double -- if not triple -- the recipe!

This is a favorite in my family. I got the recipe from my grandma and have been making it for almost every holiday. When I forgot to bring it to Thanksgiving dinner last year there was an uproar lol. The only thing I do differently is drain the crushed pineapple. It comes out MUCH better that way. This is so easy, cheap and delicious... perfect for potlucks, family gatherings, etc.

Thought this was great.  Didn't use nut and in place used shredded coconut.  Next time, I'll use sugar free cool-whip and SF pudding to make it healthier.

This is a classic. I made it when my son had friends staying over. I used 2 packages of pistachio pudding, 20oz can of pineapple, and I used almost the entire carton of "lite" whipped topping. Next time I think I will add some sliced maraschino cherries. YUM.

Only a five star with changes of course. I LOVE this salad and bring back a lot of memories. Like others have said. Drain the fruits that you choose to put in. I used one box of pudding mix, a whole 8oz container of cream, 1 cup chopped walnuts, maybe about 2 cups of marshmallows, 20 can drained pineapple, half cup of coconut and a can of drained mandarins. This is sooo perfect and everyone loves it.

I love this recipe. Very easy to make, and it was a hit at a family potluck. I used the whole 8 ounce container of cool whip, and made two bowls of this. One with nuts, and the other without. The kids liked the one without the nuts. A very cool, light and refreshing side dish.

I absolutely adore this refreshing and sweet salad! I add a little spin to mine. I add mutsu or granny smith apples, about two,also I add red or black grapes. It adds a little more "health" to this already low calorie dish. I also substitute  sugar-free pistachio pudding. In my humble opinion, you can't taste the difference! YUMMY!!!

I have always loved this recipe.  I used 20 oz pinapple tidbits and 2 pistachio pudding boxes.  I also added 1/2 cup of sour cream to cut down on the sweetness.  Delish!

This recipe has been around for years. The recipe I use calls for a 20 oz. can of crushed pineapple and the full 8 oz container of cool whip. This needs to be prepared ahead of time and refrigerated for several hours to allow it  to set up. Very tasty!

this is great.  I'm not ashamed to admit loving something so exquisitely simple.  Use the whole tub of cool-whip and the whole 20oz of pineapple.  My gramma used to put a handful of slivered almonds in but you can omit the nuts and it still rocks.  Reminds me of 4th of July picnics!

I grew up on eating this salad, so I thought it fitting to make it for my kids, especially being the color that it is and that it is so close to St. 
Patrick's Day.  They didn't like it because of the coconut, but I enjoyed this trip back to my childhood.  It was just as great as I remember it.  I topped with some toasted coconut and, of course, a cherry on top.

my husband didn't like but he doesn't normally go for these whip cream fruity salads.  meanwhile a friend told me this was a regular at her family holiday dinners and i tried it and loved it.  good to note though it does NOT save well as leftovers.

My mother-in-law shared this recipe with me. She likes to use fruit cocktail, which I don't like.  I add pineapple tidbits & other fruit (tropical blend). Since she and my husband are diabetics, I use the sugar free pistachio pudding and omit the marshmallow.  But the very best change I made is using chopped pistachio nuts instead of walnuts or pecans. This really enhances the pistachio flavor!

I LOVE this recipe as it reminds me of our family Holiday dinners when I was growing up. I always add extra pineapple, and the whole tub of cool whip. I leave out the nuts since my husband is allergic to them. It's always best chilled overnight and it's always a hit at any function.

GREAT!!! Made it for Thankgiving and everyone ate it all up.  Very sweet though.  BUt delicious!! Next time  I will add less nuts.  
Note:  I have made this recipe several times this month.  If yours turns out a little to sweet, add a little more Cool Whip until you get the taste you want.  I always add more cool whip.  The first time I made it, it was too sweet, but I think I have perfected it.  Thanks!

One of our traditional family recipes - there are few fruit salads that are liked by so many generations in our family.  This one is by far our favorite, and a holiday meal isn't complete with out it.

Great recipe! The only thing I changed was that I ended up adding pineapple tidbits because I couldn't taste the crushed pineapple. I garnished with coconut, pecans, and a pineapple ring. Great recipe!

Awesome recipe. I've made it four times in the past six months and the ONLY changes I have made is to drain the pineapple and add more cool whip and mini marshmallows (just 'cause that's the way we like it).  I had to Double, then TRIPLE and then QUADRUPLE the recipe, because the first two times, not everybody got some.  It was gone too fast!! Everybody loves it and I'm requested to make it all the time now.  Oh yeah, it's INCREDIBLY easy to make!

I love this Salad! But i make it a little bit different. i use a whole container of cool whip and i added a small container of cottage cheese. It takes some of the sweetness away. My whole family prefers it with cottage cheese. It is soo good!

My gramma used to make a similar salad, as she was the queen of Jello salads! But I remember coconut in her's. And she would make it with lime jello sometimes. This was really tasty and a big hit at my Easter dinner.

I make this for all kinds of things, baby showers, holiday dinners. It's so easy to make and takes only a few minutes! Some are apprehensive to try it because of how it looks but they all do eventually and they love it. So many people have requested this recipe from me! The only thing I change about it is I use pecans instead of walnuts because they're sweeter.

My mother has made this for as long as I can remember.  Sooo good.  We use pecans and I think it's a way better compliment, but it's whatever you like and that's what's great about it!  Also, I don't like a lot of pineapple flavor so less is best in my book.

Good flavor, but it was kind of bland. I added more marshmallows because they are my favorite. It was good, but not great.

This is very yummy.  A nice refreshing dessert.  I used pecans instead of walnuts. Quick to make.

I 3x the recipe. I thought that 20 oz of crushed pineapple, instead of 24 oz, would be okay but it wasn't enough for my taste, might even want to add more than 24 next time. I used the 'extra creamy' cool whip and only used 1 tub vs. 1 1/2 tubs. I also put about half a package of cream cheese in.
Definitely a hit with the folks and the roommates.
But really, I made this salad because it's called WATERGATE SALAD. And thats badass. I did a little research and apparently it's called watergate salad because it was popularized around when all that Watergate stuff was going down.

This is a must have at all our Holiday Get togethers. I like to use sugar free-fat-free pudding mix and lite cool whip, I also like to use pecans in place of the walnuts.

This is so good I've brought it to many cookouts and potlucks and everyone loves it. It's really easy and inexpensive! I usually double the receipe so that it feeds lots of people and we get the leftovers! :) Definately make it ahead of time so that you can stick it in the fridge because that makes it taste even better!

When I first made this I used the 8 oz can of pineapple.  The mixture came out really thick, but I loved the strong pistachio taste.  Next I made it using a 20 oz can of pineapple.  But this made it too runny and it had WAY too much pineapple.  I'm not sure what I'll try next.  Maybe two 8 oz cans.

Also, I used chopped pistachios instead of walnuts.  YUM!!

This salad is wonderful, and very easy to make.  I made a few changes when I make it. I use a 20 oz. can of pineapple instead of 8 oz.  I also add a cup of shredded coconut for an extra texture in the salad.

I have used this recipe for years, but if you try adding cheesecake flavored cream cheese, in addition to all of the other ingredients, the taste is so good.  I have to be careful not to taste it, else there will be nothing left for the guests.

Used sugar free pudding mix and fat free cool whip.  No one knew the difference as it's still so sweet!  Save a bit of the ingredients to top on top for a pretty presentation.  A couple of cheeries on top would have added some nice color.  The whole thing of cool whip is mandatory.  Make it!

Very easy to make but a little heavy and rich - more Cool Whip might help.

My mom makes this every year & once I got married I had to get a copy from her to continue the tradition. When I was a kid I wouldn't go near it although my sister liked it. The only difference is I use a whole container of cool whip.

I was feeling nostalgic... looking for a recipe from my childhood that mom used to make for camping trips and  was happy to find here.  Mom didn't use the walnuts but I love 'em so I added them in.  I also stay away from whipped topping so I whipped up heavy whipping cream with a little sugar in place of the store bought container.  It was delicious and held its body/texture perfectly!  Great little trip down memory lane...

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a great addition to the meal. I did the 20 oz of crushed pineapple, drained, and a full 8 oz tub of whipped topping. I took the suggestion of adding a can of drained fruit cocktail, and I actually prefer it without. The flavor of the fruit cocktail didn't really meld well with the pineapple flavor, so save yourself the effort and make it without the fruit cocktail.

My grandmother always made this. we called it Grandma's Green Glop! But she used a box of lime Jello also. she mixed it with just one cup of hot water so it was very strong. She also added cool whip and crushed pineapple! AMAZING!

I did as many reviewers recommended, put a 20oz can of pineapple (tidbits) with juice and a whole 8oz container of whipped topping and it was a success. I made it 24hrs before the party and everybody liked it.  It was an awesome recipe and will be making it again and again.

I've been making this recipe for many years. I have also used 1 cup of whipping cream, whipped, in place of the Cool Whip. It makes it less sweet which my family likes better. This is one of my hubby's favorites!

I HAVE USED THIS RECIPE FOR YEARS AND EVERYONE LOVES IT.  SINCE IT IS GREEN, IT IS FUN TO USE MARICHINO CHERRIES CUT IN HALF AND MIXED IN THIS TIME OF YEAR.  RED AND GREEN, GET IT?

This is my favorite dessert salad. People asked me to bring this so often that I make this for all gatherings I attend now.  I have used crushed pineapple or pineapple tidbits, either works fine.  I use pecans instead of walnuts. Lastly, I use a whole container of cool whip.  The extra creamy cool whip is *really* good in this recipe.  

I make this without marshmallows for my veggie husband.  The flavor is good, but obviously the consistency is different.

This was really good. I think it would be better using more cool whip and pineapple as well as less marshmallows. But all in all, delicious recipe! Thanks :)

I love this recipe. This has been a family tradition for years. I am a texture person and don't like the walnuts or pistacchios in it, so I run the pudding mix through a sifter first to get all of them out. Love it!!

This has been a family favorite of ours for years; except I use about 1/2 bag of marshmallows, whole container of cool whip and I agree, pecans are better.  I love this stuff and always get lots of thumbs up when I make it.

The classic recipe has 2 exceptions- #1. A 20 oz. can of pineapple and #2. 1 cup of sour cream. My grandma used her mom's recipe and this tastes close but just not the same.

This salad is so easy to make and it tastes incredible. My son loves it, and it's also perfect for church potlucks and funerals. I always leave the nuts out.

I don't know why I love this, I just do! I don't like boxed pudding, marshmallows or cool whip, but put them together in this salad and I can't get enough of it! Made it to go with our St. Patrick's day meal, for no other reason than it was green, and it brought back memories! Thanks for the recipe!

I accidently made this not knowing it had a name. I made the regular fruit salad with cool whip (fruit cocktail, mandarin oranges, bananas, etc) and had a box of pistachio pudding that I decided to throw in & try it. I only used 1/2 of a small box & it gave it the perfect flavor (not too strong). It went great with all the fruit too. This is a great recipe that you can change up & add anything you want (including nuts, marshmallows, etc).

I have to admit, when I first read this recipe I was VERY hesitant on using it.  But, I needed something new to take to a picnic and this looked interesting enough.  This is VERY good!  It's light and refreshing and it couldn't be easier (or cheaper) to make.

I read most of the reviews and all the similar recipes and decided on this one. I did not use the marshmallows, we dont like them in this sort of dessert. I used a whole 20oz can of pineapple chunks(drained the juice and crushed them a bit)I added enough juice for consistancy. I added about 1/2 cup coconut, used fat free cool whip. I thought it was too sweet. I'd be tempted to try it with unsweetened whipping cream but then the fat content would be crazy.

I doubled this recipe, sort of....I used a 12-oz tub of cool whip, used 2 boxes of pudding mix, kept the nuts at 1/2 cup.  I doubled the marshmallows - but used one 15-oz can of crushed pineapple w/juice AND one 15-oz can of pineapple chunks w/ only a BIT of the juice from that one!   Gave a bit more to "chew" on - plus some more tang.    Thanks for the great recipe - it was too hot to bake a dessert - so really did the trick!!!!!!!

I have always enjoyed this nice and fluffy dessert. I know that some people add cottage cheese to this salad,but it is up to your own personal preference. I happen to love cottage cheese,so I usually make one dish with the cottage cheese added,and one dish without the cottage cheese. I find that if I choose to add cottage cheese,I puree it,before adding it to the salad,so it doesn't overwhelm the taste of the salad too much. This is an excellent summer dish,very nice and refreshing!!*SMILE* P.S. Everytime I make this dish,people are literally scraping the bowl clean!!

This is the recipe that got me started on making "fluffs", but of all the fluff recipes I've tried this one is still our favorite. There isn't a person in my family who doesn't enjoy this recipe. It is so yummy. Makes a wonderful late night snack.

Had no idea this would taste so good.  It was great and soooo so EASY to make. It looked a little funny (unless you are used to eating sea green colored food, but it was great. I left out a lot of the marshmellows just because they arent my favorite food and added extra nuts the third or fourth time I made it.

Very good holiday salad, it's been served for Thanksgiving and Christmas in my family ever since I can remember, and now I'm the one that makes it to bring to family holiday meals.

A family tradition. I use a 20 oz can of crushed pineapple and pecans instead of walnuts.  Great for the holidays.

Pretty good!  A little rich but that can be fixed by adding more cool whip.  I added chopped pistachios and it was very tasty!  Not sure how kid-friendly it is . . .my 4 month old is not ready for it yet!

Not too sweet if you use crushed pineapple in juice (instead of syrup), very light and refreshing.  Most kids seem to like it better without the nuts (and it lasts longer in the fridge that way too).  The recipe makes a lot, but people tend to eat a lot too, so it works out great.

I love watergate salad. And this is a great starter recipe. But I know what my family and I like so I altered it a little bit. I mixed together 2 packs of pistachio pudding jell-o mix, 8 oz container of whipped topping, 3/4 cup mini marshmallows, 1/2 cup crushed walnuts, 20 oz crushed pineapple can with juice, 1/2 cup of shredded coconut. After it set I garnished it with maraschino cherries. It was soooo good!

Made this with the following changes: 2 small boxes instant pistachio pudding mix, one 20 oz can of crushed pineapple  (drained), one cup chopped pecans, 2 cups miniature marshmallows, 16 oz whipped topping. I've been making this for years and everyone loves it! Gave 5 stars based on my changes.

I was wondering  why the pistachio  pudding  didn't have to be mixed with milk like pudding is usually done and then mixed with the rest of the ingredients?  It didn't look like much watergate salad after I doubled the recipe.  Still it was delicious

Perfect recipe for watergate salad, minus the juice. I have to drain it else I'd end up with a soupy mess. This recipe reminds me of trips to Shoney's with my grandma 20 years ago, thank you for bringing a little of that back to me!

This a very classic recipe but a nice customization is to make whip topping by using heavy cream, omitting the walnuts and adding in Mandarin Orange segments from those little Dole fruit cups

Really good version of ambrosia - never tried it with pudding before.  But am I the only one who didn't get where the 3.4 oz comes from?  Small boxes are 1 oz so large boxes must be double that?  I doubled the recipe so used 2 small boxes and doubled the whipped topping, and used 20 oz can of pineapple.
My son in law is allergic to nuts, even the small amount in pistachio pudding mix, so I used banana pudding instead and substituted coconut for the nuts.  It was mediocre right after making it, but once it chilled it was delish!  I'm sure coconut cream, french vanilla or white chocolate pudding mix would also work well.

This is a very good recipe.  I read the review of others and added 20 oz crushed drained pineapple instead of 8 oz.  Later I poured in the pineapple water little by little until I reached the right texture.  It is very easy to make and truly delicious. Thanks Jennifer for posting this recipe.

I'm not a huge "fluff" fan, but everyone loved it! DRAIN THE PINEAPPLE! USE PECANS! REFRIGERATE BEFORE SERVING! I garnished the top with some multi colored mini marshmallows!

We just call this "Green Stuff" in our family. However, we use one whole bag mini marshmallows, double the puddings, a whole 20 oz can of crushed pineapple, and 2 containers whipped topping. It makes a ton, but lasts for several days in the fridge.

I haven't had Watergate Salad for 20 years!  I remembered it, but had never prepared it myself (I was surprised there was no milk added), but this tasted just like I remembered!  YUMMY!

I make mine a little different... I drain the pineapple juice and put the nuts on the side incase someone doesnt want them. This recipe is also good with other fruit too... even the fruit cocktail mix. I learned about this recipe from my gramma and now I make it every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Some people dont want to try it because of the green color, but once they do they love it, lol.

I've been doing this great delight for years. I usually add the mini colored marshmellows some times to give it an extra fruity flavor. 

Before a big church function, picnic or any occasion, I usually make this the nite before to give the salad more time to set up and the flavors to meld together.

Excellent, I accidentally bought tidbits instead of crushed, but am glad I did, I drained all juice except for maybe a couple tablespoons until I thought it looked right and it wasn't soupy at all - yummy!

This is the best. I remember my grandmother making this when I was a child. I am so glad I have found the recipe, she never wrote it down. Now I can share some of my childhood favorites with my family. Thank you.

This is one of my favorite recipes! I tasted Watergate Salad years ago, since I am from the DC area, it was very popular at restaurants and delis in that area. I was very exited to find this recipe and made it for a pot-luck lunch at work during holiday time. Needless to say, EVERYONE wanted the recipe!
I prepared it as directe, but I think I may have increased the cool whip amount because it looked like it needed it and it still was great!

I also added two cans of fruit coctail, sans juice, to give the salad a little more color, flavor and texture.

This is an awesome summer salad!  I put in more crushed pineapple like others suggested (glad I did, otherwise it would have been too sweet) and I put in the whole container of cool whip.  It was a hit at an outdoor summer potluck.  Will certainly make this again!

This recipie turned out to be quit a success. This was my first time making Watergate Salad. I myself am not a fan, but my husband LOVES the stuff. Based off of his reveiw, it was a delicious whipped treat. I did alter the recipie a bit by adding the full 8 oz conatiner of the whipped topping. Instead of pecans, I used thinly chopped Almonds since neither one of us cares for walnuts or pecans. The only thing I would change next time is the amount of nuts. I used the 1/2 cup and he said it was way too much, besides that, great recipie.

My mother in law would make this for Christmas dinner, but never would tell me HOW she made it. I found this recipe by accident, and when I made it, I found that it's just like the "salad" she makes. Heh. Now I know. Thank you for posting this recipe.

Tastes great, but the recipe needs to be (at least) tripled in order to have enough to take to a party.  I also used more pineapple and whipped topping to make it a little less pistachio-y.

Great salad and always gets great reviews.  I used a 20oz can crushed pineapple, with juice and the whole container of Cool Whip.  This way you have a lot more for company.

I first got this recipe from my college cook in the 70s, brought it back home to California and everyone loved it.  I lost my own copy of the recipe and am always guessing on the quantities.  I was glad to find it here.

Great salad.  I used the reduced fat whipped topping and it turned out great.  I did not have any nut to put in my salad though.

Simple yet delicious. Very tasty and low-calorie (if you use sugar free pudding and lite 'cool whip' type topping and go easy on the nuts). The only problem is that it's not really filling, so you tend to eat a LOT of it!

Yes. I'm lactose intolerant and used almond milk to make the pudding. I used pecans instead of walnuts also. And yes I will be making it again.  A real family favorite this one!!!

This has become a family favorite.  The kids love it and always ask for it when they come home.  We leave out the walnuts due to allergies but still great.

Made the recipe as stated. It was the only thing made that had no leftovers. I make a lot of different sides. I went out of my way to buy the mini marshmallows which I don't really think add anything to the taste so when I make again I will probably omit them. It has already been requested for Christmas.

My family loves this! I don’t take anything else to family dinners now. A few things I found is that I usually have to double it to serve my family of 12 and let the whipped cream thaw before adding it or it will make it kind of runny.

Making notes from other reviewers  and will do the official update when I make it
Use a20 oz. can of crushed pineapple (drained),
Use the entire 8 oz. container of Cool Whip 
Add 1 can of fruit cocktail, drained, (stretch it out a bit) 
Make sure to allow enough time for this to chill in the fridge before serving... I'd say at least 6 hours, but overnight would be even better.

I have made this several times, and loved it! I always add more marshmallows and 8 oz of cool whip is not enough for me so I use the 16oz and use almost all of it. Let’s say about 14oz. I have also added extra pineapples and found I like that too. This is an awesome dish for any occasion!

Love these salads!
Used about 3/4 of tub of whipping cream but could have put whole thing in.
Used 19oz can of pineapple partly drained some juice in with pudding mix and used rest of can with recipe.
Will make again!

My family has been making this delicious concoction for years!  We call it simply pistachio pudding. Definitely double the whipped cream for sure. We also top it with canned mandarin oranges and maraschino cherries, I usually let the kids do this part and get a little creative. Makes it much more appealing if you are taking it somewhere.

I make this frequently but change it up with different pudding flavors so my family doesn’t get tired of it. One of our favorites is banana pudding and use half the pineapple amount and the other half strawberries. I’ve also used lemon pudding with the pineapple. I like the nuts but my family doesn’t so I leave them out and sprinkle a few on my serving. I always drain off at least half of the pineapple juice too.

This was a great dish! Needs a 20 oz. can of pineapple. I used pecans in place of walnuts. I also added cherries to the top for color.

Although this was as easy to make as I remembered, I had forgotten just how sweet it is.  A rounded serving spoon of this was more than any of us could eat.  Guess our taste buds have changed since the 1970-80s.

I make this salad with no changes, and it is delicious.  It also has a long shelf life.  I always make this salad when we travel with our fifth wheel because it's so convenient.  It also brings back fond memories of my Mom...this was one of her favorites!

I omitted the nuts and add maraschino cherries with the juice. Also add a few drops green food coloring to keep the color. Everyone loves this and is a must every Thanksgiving and Christmas.

I've made this a few times. Of course I make adjustments as I go - I tend to add more walnuts. I also halve maraschino cherries and mix them through the salad (not on this ingredient list). I've even added shredded coconut.It's a perfect addition.

I also changed it with the suggestions listed. 2 boxes of pistachio pudding,   2-20oz cans crushed pineapple drained., only adding enough juice to create a creamy consistency before adding 2- 8 oz of whip cream and enough marshmallows as desired.

This is a classic. I had forgotten about it until I came across this recipe. I used the entire 20oz can of pineapple and 8oz cool whip. I also over chopped and ended up with about a full cup of walnuts which I added but now think the original quantity would've been better. I also threw in a bit more marshmallows... Great classic! Thanks!

I have asked my family for years if anyone could remember  the "Green Smore" recipe Grandma made and no one could. 15 yrs later,I was describing the dish to a friend who told me it sounded like Watergate salad. So glad to have found this. Thank you for sharing!

This was my first time ever making a Watergate salad. It came out beautifully. And I doubled the recipe. I did not drain all of the pineapple juice into the salad and it was fluffy. Thank you for this delicious recipe!

Very good. I changed it a bit. I used mandarin oranges and homemade whipped cream(unsweetened) and did not put nuts. It was very good and not too sweet. The pistachio pudding is very sweet.  It was a hit! I had a little girl that is borderline diabetic so I did this so she could eat some. I know some people even put in coconut flakes. I don't But it's an idea.  Love reading the suggestions and changes. Love this site and your magazine is awesome!!!!!

Added double the whipped cream.  It was the only bowl that was emptied out among the 20 potluck dishes.  A few friends didn't even get to eat it, it was gone THAT fast!

This salad is so good and so easy.  I remember making it years ago.  I did use the whole eight ounce container of Cool Whip.  Almost everyone loves this and there are never any leftovers.  I'm glad I found your recipe Jennifer.

For this recipe I used 1 1/2 packages of the pudding mix,20 ounce can of crushed pineapple-in its own juice, in which I drained and saved the juice of the reserved juice I then used 3/4 cup of the pineapple juice. I also used 8 ounces of cool whip. DO NOT use the low fat or fat free cool whip, it just doesn't taste as good an makes it very watery. Every time I make this there is never any left. It is our favorite!

very easy to make and very good. My only mistake was looking at some of the other suggestions and adding a bag of frozen fruit such as strawberries blueberries and raspberries. Although it still tasted good it made the salad red! It didn't work well for my St Patricks dessert! But when I added a few green food coloring drops it made it more turquoise haha!

my chef in my culinary arts class handed out this recipe for us all to make. when I made it, I was totally blown away. it was totally awesome!! we made our own whipped topping, which is fairly easy to make. it is good with or without the nuts. I made it twice to see if the nuts had a difference. it doesn't, so if you or your family has a nut allergy, you can leave them out because they don't add anything but a little crunch to it. oh, and it is a nice dessert salad.

With the changes in the other reviews, this is a great recipe.  If you make it as written, the proportions are all wrong.  Delicious though and a great summer treat!

Used whole container of cool whip and used cherries instead of nuts and drained pineapple.
