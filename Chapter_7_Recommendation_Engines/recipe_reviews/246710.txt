I made this EXACTLY as written; therefore, I can accurately review the recipe AS WRITTEN.  It is surprisingly good considering how simple it is.  I suspect this will become the basis for a regular soup on our menu rotation.  I topped the soup with homemade croutons and grated Parmigiano Reggiano,  and I served with it a crusty bread and a dry white wine.  Best bread:  La Brea Bakery's Take and Bake Tuscan Loaf.     A great starting point.  I recommend you make it as written before you start improvising.  Have fun; there is a lot of room for experimentation.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had to change this up some only because I have a daughter with a dairy allergy and my other daughter is vegetarian. I used vegetable broth and coconut cream. I used three cans of white beans and added more broth. I used an immersion blender but left some beans and asparagus, tried to get most of rosemary blended. Great flavor and something different that was quick and easy. Oh, I used my slow cooker and just had it on low all day. Really a good recipe!

I must admit...weird recipes intrigue me. I would never have thought of putting white beans and asparagus together. But it works! I used Great Northern Beans and followed the recipe exactly. It creates a smooth and silky "cream of" soup so much better tasting and better for you than canned soup.
