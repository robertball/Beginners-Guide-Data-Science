I am switching to vegetarianism, which is a drastic change for me. This was the first recipe I made AND enjoyed!  I've made a batch every week for a month.  I simmered the onion and veggies without oil and used fresh tomatoes...love it, thanks!

This was delicious, and I would make it again in a heart beat. I used 4 cups vegetable bouillon (2 bouillon cubes / 4 cups water), cannellini beans and just added some fresh/frozen basil, as I didn't have any canned diced tomatoes with the basil included. It is a very hearty soup, with not a lot of liquid. You can always add more broth if you prefer it that way, but I enjoyed it just as is.

I wish this was a little more flavorful. I added uncooked macaroni and corn. My daughter who normally refuses soup ate two bowls though.

This comes together remarkably well, and with a few tweaks can be an amazingly tasty low sodium treat! I used unsalted beef stock, with an extra 1.5 cups to bring it to a consistency I like. Unsalted canned tomatoes and kidney beans,  and 2 Tbsp of coconut aminos (a low salt soy sauce substitute} instead of added salt. I also sliced only 1 carrot in thin slivers and made up for it with diced sweet yellow peppers. Delicious and only 39 sodium per cup!!

Edit: in the future instead of Italian seasoning I think I'll just use separate basil and oregano.

Great recipe.  I used the Instant Pot.  I should've gone with 13 minutes for cooking time.  I went with 15 and a quick release.  The potatoes were a little overcooked.

Very good and versatile enough if you'd like to add or subtract for your own preferences.  As others have mentioned, there wasn't enough broth.  I ended up doubling our broth, so then added another can or tomatoes and more herbs to keep the flavor balanced.  It's even better left-over!

The only change I will make to the recipe when I make it again, is adding additional veg broth.  I think 6 cups would be about right.

Always a good, quick minestroni. I add a small handful of parsley (subtle), sometimes chicken broth base, instead of vegetable, and occasionally a large turnip instead of potatoes. Also,  1/2  to one cup of rice macaroni or other favorite pasta. Spinach too instead of kale.

This was super good and easy!  I made this for my first "meatless Monday".  I think next time I might add a little cayenne for some zip.

Great soup! Used frozen spinach instead of kale and added some leftover garbanzo beans to the soup.
