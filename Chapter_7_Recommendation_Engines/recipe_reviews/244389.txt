This was yummy. I had multi colored quinoa so I used that. I also had some hard boiled eggs in fridge so I just used that and sprinkled it with th seasoning... I like my eggs with no runniness anyway. Will make again

For those complaining about the picture... I LIKE hard cooked eggs... the recipe states cook eggs to desired doneness.  If you want scrambled, or sunnyside or whatever,,, make the eggs the way YOU want it.  And if you don't like the picture, take one yourself and post it...

I felt the recipe was a good but just a touch bland. I used the recipe as a starter and added ingredients to suit my taste.  I made a quick pico de gallo  (tomatoes, onion, jalapeño, cilantro) and also added black beans to the mix.  I think this added a little more depth to the flavor and complemented the base ingredients nicely.

This is yummy and full of protein, a great way to start the day and not be hungry before lunch!  However, please do not post a picture of something that is different from the ingredients  or instructions.

Made as written it was very good without a bunch of stuff added. Honestly, try it the way its written its good. Sometimes the flavor of a dish is the combination of ingredients not the added seasoning.  I get so tired of reading reviews where a rating is given and they don't even come close to trying the original recipe. Especially when they change a bunch of ingredients and then rate it poorly. smh
I used tri color quinoa and experimented with cooking it in the microwave so I could cook that part while getting ready. I would love to post how but I havent perfected it yet. lol BTW burnt quinoa is as bad as burnt popcorn.....take it outside. haha    I added some salt to the cooking quinoa and to the egg and avocado. I have fresh blue eggs from my hens and avocado and feta are staples in my fridge. Quinoa is a nice alternative to the usual breakfast carb. I like the tri-color because it has different textures.

Wow, this was so good!  I had regular quinoa, so used that.  This is only the second time I've made quinoa, and I really enjoyed it in this recipe.  I cooked my eggs over-easy.  The combination of flavors was really tasty!  Thanks for sharing.

I have made this recipe twice, and I really loved it the second time. The first time I stuck to the recipe and also did my eggs over easy. The second time I scrambled the eggs with spinach and grape tomatoes, which I think is the way to go. A serving of this recipe is pretty small. The second time I made it for lunch and ate both servings.

This is a keeper. I can eat this every day.  Fast and simple i made enough quinoa and hard boiled eggs for a few days  to make a quick breakfast all week. i used hard boiled eggs  sliced and served on the side instead and just mixed the avacado chunks, quinoa and feta together, sprinkled with a little olive oil and great healthy protein breakfast

Excellent recipe  that's quick and healthy! To keep things healthier I used hard-boiled eggs instead of fried since I already had them on hand. I also happened to have leftover red quinoa already cooked, so this was perfect! The feta adds a nice touch. Yummy! Next time I will try scrambled and mix everything together.

This was awesome! I did make a few changes based on what I had and on some other reviewers' comments. I used red pepper and basil quinoa and fryed up some green peppers and spinach I had. I also used guacamole because I had that but didn't have any avocados. Finally, I put some hot sauce on it. It was great!

I'm always looking for new ways to eat a healthy breakfast. I liked this. I scrambled the eggs with spinach, mushrooms, and bell pepper inside. My Husband picked the feta out of it, but I liked it. I will make it again.

This combo over a bed of arugula drizzled with olive oil & vinegar makes a marvelous lunch meal! I use hard boiled eggs, as shown in the photo.

This was good for something different. It is the first time I tried the red version of quinoa and I liked it! I made my bowl with the eggs over easy.

I made this for breakfast this morning as a nice alternative to our standard eggs and toast. The hubby and I both enjoyed it. The only change I made was adding a second egg and a little more cheese. I will definitely be making this again!

Love, love, loved it! Used leftover wild rice for the grain. Also added diced tomato and used alderwood-smoked salt. Beautiful brunch item.

Great combination of ingredients and textures - my changes: eggs are hard-boiled (not cooked in skillet), cooled the quinoa before adding to the bowl, added Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute rather than salt / pepper.

Quite delicious! Such a versatile recipe. I used spicy pickled eggs and tofu (instead of feta). Leftovers make a great lunch on the go. Thank you for sharing.

We are low carb, so we removed the quinoa and added some MCT oil.   We replaced the feta with goat cheese and this is a real treat.
This is also good when the hard boiled egg is replaced with scrambled eggs.
Also good warm or cold and with a little diced lettuce or kale for a lunch item.
This recipe is a basis for many great meals and should be one of your staples if healthy eating is your aim.

I use hard boiled eggs and substitute Gorgonzola or reduced fat blue cheese for the feta. Adds more flavor. I make this for my lunch at work often. It sticks with you and gives you energy.

I made a few changes mostly out of preference, but I think without these changes it would be just as delicious.  I used light colored quinoa, it's what I had and I added a tiny bit of salt while it cooked.  I made my egg sunny side up and a little runny (I know the recipe says to make it this way, but the picture shows hard boiled....quite a bit of contention in reviews about this fact).  I added a little garlic powder on top of my egg (instead of season salt) as it cooked.  I added some lemon juice to my quinoa and I added the season salt to the quinoa (instead of on top of the egg) in my bowl and mixed before adding the other toppings.  I also added thinly sliced green onion to the top.  So, so good!

If I had served this just by the recipe, my hubby would have turned his nose up....thus the 4 stars.  After preparing it pretty much to recipe I added some chopped spinach and tomatoes, topped with EVO, lemon, truffle sea salt and pepper.  Mixed it all together and 'viola!'  he ate every bit.  As for me, I loved it!  P. S.  Just for the record...I did serve it with boiled egg.  Me and fried egg (no runny yoke for me, thank you) just don't jive.  I would never had tried this great recipe if it hadn't pictured the hard boiled egg.....just saying!

Great and easy breakfast, lunch or quick dinner for one.  I cook a batch of quinoa on the weekend and also hard boil several eggs.  This packs great in a travel bowl for breakfast break or lunch at the office. I don't like feta, but sometimes add a bit of chopped ham or leftover chicken...sautéed spinach...or even three-bean salad.  Dice the avocado on top and I sprinkle with Everything Bagel  seasoning or Penzeys Italian Dressing mix. Fastest bowl in the west with hard-cooked eggs.  Jeez Jan--lighten up!

Excellent breakfast! I as well added black beans and substituted Cotija for Feta cheese since I had that on hand. We feel so healthy and energized. In addition to this healthy bowl, we had fresh peaches and blueberries to complete a healthy morning.

This breakfast bowl will become a part of my choices.  It WAS easy to make.  I cooked the quinoa in a rice cooker.  The next time I have it, I'll try some salsa on it for more flavor and texture.  Thanks for this one!

I will double the amount of quinoa next time. I added a chicken boullion cube to flavor the quinoa, but it was too much salt for the amount of quinoa the recipe calls for; definitely double it. There simply wasn't enough quinoa for my hubby and I; otherwise, it was delicious AND healthy :)

I have never left a review for a recipe but with this one I felt like I had to. Let me begin by saying that this was one of the best breakfast bowls I have ever had. I stuck to the original recipe but added a few things. First,  I added about  3 Tbs of black beans. Then I added about a handful of blueberries and dried cranberry's. I also used hard boiled eggs, couldn't see frying an egg for this, it just didn't seem right. To top it off I added a heaping tablespoon wheat germ for a little bit of a nutty flavor. Delicious!
Next time I will add some raw mushrooms and perhaps some cherry tomatoes.

A different dish that tasted great and healthy too. I made it several times for the family and all enjoyed it. Served it for a light dinner though, not breakfast.

I used two avocadoes and extra feta. I substituted hard boiled eggs instead of the fried eggs (kinda like the photo on the recipe).  Also added a wee bit of lime juice. Excellent, although I went overboard on the feta and it was a bit too salty.I'll cut back on the feta next time.

I actually put everything on some greens and added halved grape tomatoes and some smoked salmon.  I was sated all day.  I would opt in the future to cook the quinoa in a pot on the stove vs a rice cooker.

I loved this breakfast bowl!  Even though I can't have cheese, I sprinkled Beau Monde seasoning on my eggs instead of salt & pepper to give it more oomph.  I also used multi colored quinoa because it's all I had on hand.  I would definitely make this again.

Really easy to make and very flavorful. Since I don't use feta cheese much, I opted to use vegan parmesan in its place, and it's a great taste. I made a huge batch of the quinoa so I can pull this together quickly in the mornings.

I added some dried parsley and still tasted good. I used hard boiled eggs instead of fried egg. Next round I will try fried egg or scrambled egg. Surprisingly, my 14 year old daughter liked it too. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Its a healthier breakfast option.

A fresh, healthy, vegetarian breaky. Highly recommended way to get your protein in. If you make the quinoa ahead of time its super easy to assemble in a flash in the morning.
