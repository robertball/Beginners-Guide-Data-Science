I have no idea how this is supposed to look, but I bet it's not like mine turned out.  I decided to take a photo anyway!  Despite the fact that I made numerous mistakes in making this, I must admit that the taste is very yummy.  Let me tell you how NOT to make this!  Do NOT try to crowd this pavlova into a 9x13 pan--at least not without adjusting the ingredients a little!  DO pay attention to the fact that the directions call for greasing the pan on the bottom BEFORE putting down the parchment as well as after!  There is a critical reason for that!  Do NOT use extra large eggs because I think it makes too much!  Now I think I'll have to buy a 10x15 jelly roll pan just to try to make this how it should be made!  It doesn't appear that the submitter of this recipe is currently active here, so maybe there won't be a gasp of horror when this photo appears!  :)  EDIT:  We decided that next time we would not add the almonds or cinnamon!  Those flavors just do not work well with lemon in our opinion.  I do believe that one problem I had with this was that the air was too humid when I made this!

great recipe!  I did not add the almonds or cinnamon.  A hit with adults and children alike.
