I made this recipe pretty nearly, but not quite.  I changed the 1/4 cup white sugar to Organic Coconut Palm Sugar and enhanced the sweetness with 1 T Stevia/1 T xylitol.  I also reduced the amount of lemon zest to 1 t. because I often find zest a bit bitter.  I also substituted unsweetened almond milk for the soy.  Soy is sometimes bitter; almond is smoother.

The dough was a little too moist before adding the stevia/xylitol, but was perfect after that.  It was easily worked and not sticky at all.  I cut mine into 8 wedges and separated them a little before baking in order to crisp all the sides.

The result was a dough that rose just slightly (puffy) to make a perfectly textured scone, lightly browned, but with a moist (but not too moist!) center.  I wasn't sure how my sweetening adjustment would work, but it was just right, not too sweet, not too much like bread.  They were like a lightly lemoned sweet bread.  Really, really good.

My calculations put a 1/8 wedge at around 160 calories without the glaze.  (They're so good, they don't need a glaze.)  I can't believe how much nutritional GOODNESS is packed in so few calories!

I will definitely be making this again.

I made this recipe today and we (my 2.5 year old son and I) loved it! The lemon in the glaze was a bit overwhelming so I added a splash of vanilla but other than that, I didn't change a thing. This recipe will definitely be a breakfast staple for us.

My kids loved these scones, and they are picky eaters!  The texture is a little more crunchy than the usual suspects,  due to the chia seeds and the flour.  Leave some honey on the table, in case the lemon overwhelms.  Wonderful!

So yummy! I was looking for a recipe that I could use some of my chia seeds in, and this one is just perfect for a breakfast treat or brunch. I just ground up some oats as the author suggested (extremely easy in just a normal food processor/blender) for the oat flour. Didn't have a fresh lemon, so I omitted the zest, but used plenty of lemon juice. Everything else I already had on hand, so this was very simple to make. I was worried that I had patted the dough out too thinly, but they still rose up and stayed very tender. Would definitely make again - and probably double the recipe!

I came across this recipe and surprisingly already every ingredient! Although, I did use Trader Joes Unbleached all purpose flour and orange zest instead of lemon. The combination of the Orange zest with the lemon juice was terrific! I'm cutting down on the sugar so I did forego the glaze- still yummy!!

Fantastic! I made these to take to a staff meeting and they were gone before the meeting was over. Loved the drizzle and lemon was sweet and tart. Chia was a great alternative to poppy seeds.

Easy and yummy. Used coconut milk instead of soy and no frosting. Ground the chia seeds in my coffee grinder first- really like the texture theyprovide. Am making again and it's only been 2 days.

I will say I'm not a baker nor a vegan so I was pleasantly surprised when these came out great on my first try!  I couldn't find oat flour at my grocery store so I subbed tapioca flour but followed the recipe exactly other than that.  The glaze really makes these - and it's so simple, I loved it.  I'd love to add blueberries or perhaps use orange juice next time because there will be a next time.
I did have to cook mine closer to 30 minutes but it was worth the wait.  These are awesome!

I like how this is a vegan scone. The only thing I'd probably change would be the liquid, maybe a bit more lemon or milk. This was definitely a dryer scone dough and it made about 9 for me. So, suggest just a bit more liquid and to eat this with homemade strawberry chia seed jam!!!

Delicious! The glaze made it for us. We made a double batch and they disappeared! I didn't have whole wheat flour so I used AP flour and they were still yummmmmy.

These were SOOOO good! I ground oats to make the oat flour, used doTerra lemon oil instead of zest (1-3 drops per teaspoon), and added blueberries. New favorite recipe!

The lemon lovers in my house have loved this from day one. Once I subbed the glaze sugar for maple sugar when I was out of icing sugar, everyone goes crazy for them. Maple+lemon, who knew? Easy, healthy & delicious. I also use homemade almond milk and like to throw in some of the almond meal as well. The recipe is flexible, just make sure it has enough moisture.

Even not being a fan of lemon, I saw this recipe and jumped on it because most of the base ingredients were right up my alley :).  I replaced the lemon and sweetness of the white sugar by blending 4 deglet dates in the NutriBullet and mixed in the chopped pieces into my overall mixture. In addition to chia seeds, I also threw in 1/2 tsp each of ground flax and hemp. As such I found I needed an additional tbsp of milk than recipe called for. In any case, the final product came out nice and crisp on the outside and chewy on the inner! Making tonight as well!

These were great! Super easy to make, even on the first try. I added poppyseeds to mine and left out the chia seeds and they were delicious.

First time I ever made a vegan scone. I didn't have soy milk, so I substituted cashew milk, and it turned out fine. The glaze made them so yummy. Best while still warm, in my opinion.

No. I made this for a friend who is a vegan. Not only did she love it, but my husband said it's one of his favorite scones!

I use almond milk instead of soy, because that's what I have. It works great. I also use Truvia baking blend sugar, as I can't have sugar. Both substitute perfectly.

I made this recipe as written, except I swapped out soy milk for almond milk because that’s what I had at home. The scones generally came out well, though they were a little bland. As a tip: you can cut down the frosting to half a cup of confectioner’s sugar as opposed to the full cup. Halfing the sugar still makes plenty of frosting.

These were amazing! I would make them into small bite size treats rather than a fun scone then you can enjoy them longer.
