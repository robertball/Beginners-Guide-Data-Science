Couldn't have been simpler, and was a great spin on a spinach side dish.  Excellent!!

Quick, easy, and tasty.  I used a LOT of garlic powder to get it to taste the way I wanted it to, so maybe minced fresh garlic would be a better choice for people who like a lot of flavor.  This is going to replace my normal, boring spinach at the dinner table from now on.

I prepare spinach like this routinely, sometimes with mushrooms, sometimes without, and always with fresh minced garlic.  This was the first time using shitake mushrooms, however, and I liked the firmer, more substantive texture and earthy flavor they contributed (even though they sort of look like slugs). Five to seven minutes is too long a cooking time - a few minutes should do it, just until the spinach wilts and retains its vibrant green color.

Only 4 stars since I added to it: I used fresh garlic, added a tsp or so of lemon juice, a dash of crushed red pepper and a dash or two of Worcestershire sauce to jazz it up.  It was very good.  My husband wrinkled up his nose at it until he tasted it, he thought he only liked canned spinach.  He had seconds.

This is so delicious! Don't be shy with the garlic powder, though.  I was not disappointed in the taste and I don't really even like shitake mushrooms.  The shitakes are an excellent ingredient in this recipe.  Highly recommended!

This was fast and easy. I used canned sliced button mushrooms and only a quarter of an onion. I had to add more olive oil though. I did sprinkle a bit of salt over the dish as it cooked. This was good but needed more flavor or something to pep it up. Thanks, we enjoyed this dish.

It's delicious. And yeah, definitely use frozen spinach; it's 1/10th the cost of "fresh" and really, I only consider something fresh if it's been picked the same day I use it. Bagged spinach has been sitting on a truck, then in a store for days if not a week or more, losing all it's nutrients.

Looking for a different way to use my shiitake mushrooms, I decided to try this recipe. It was so good, my bf loved it. I also tried adding squares of aubergine and it was soooo delicious!

I love this recipe!  Since my girls don't like mushrooms, I have replaced them with carrots sliced thin so they cook at the same rate as the onion.  I also added basil and oregano to give it more flavor... but not too much - you don't want to over-power the spinach.

Pretty good. Only change made was to use button mushrooms instead of shiitake as I don't like the woodsy flavor they have.

This should have been amazing, but i really botched it. Word to the wise: DO NOT substitute garlic powder with a haphazard improvisation of pepper, Mrs. Dash and crushed red pepper flakes. GROSS! Such a shame! Halfway into my preparations, i realized that i had left my shiitake mushrooms AND garlic powder at my boyfriend's house...what are the odds? well, my attempt to salvage the recipe stunk, but i definitely want to try it again!

A nice change of pace from the regular spinach dish. I added some parmesan for extra flavor.

While easy to prepare, this was lacking something. I added a lot of garlic powder but it still needed salt, pepper and then I finally added bacon. Won't be making again.

This is a really great and tasty way to get your dose of dark leafy greens, shiitake mushrooms, and garlic.  It's a family favorite side dish that goes GREAT with black bean garlic pork chops or sesame garlic chicken!  I do recommend the use of fresh chopped or pressed garlic in addition to garlic powder or salt to give it that extra flavor.

This was quite nice for a side dish (I had it with meatloaf). I made it as written, with maybe a little more shiitakes since I had some to us up. I got baby spinach in 6-ounce bags, so I just weighed out 10 ounces for this recipe. I didn't eat this with my fingers, for the full experience, but I enjoyed it. It's going into my recipe box.

I went heavy on the shiitake mushrooms and added a bit of salt, but otherwise prepared it as described.  Really yummy, easy, quick, and healthy.

Big fan of spinach here, but did not care for this dish.  Maybe with some seasonings other than garlic powder.  Won't try this one again.

We found this to be too bland for our tastes.  Maybe I should have used more garlic powder.

Delish way to eat some of the healthiest food around!  I added a little bit of left over carrot and green onion, used fresh spinach, and added red pepper flakes, minced garlic, worsterchester (sp) sauce, lemon juice, and basil for added flavor based on previous reviews. It’s got a nice little kick!

I cook spinach and mushrooms this way all the time. Instead of garlic powder I use fresh minced garlic and I add salt, pepper crushed red pepper flakes and a tbs of fresh squeezed lemon juice. Good basic recipe.

This was a good way to prepare spinach.
