I took this cake to a potluck. It was wonderful. I had a co-worker ask for the recipe right there. She went home and made it that night and told me the next day that it was GREAT. Two reviews in one.

I love the taste of chocolate together with cherry and this cake has them both. It's very very good and I'll be making it again. For those who don't know about sour milk called for in the recepe it can be made by adding 1 Tablespoon vinegar to one cup of milk (stir wait 15 minutes before using). A yummer.

I must have done something wrong but I followed it to a tee! This cake turned out to be a two inch frisbee I could rap with my knuckles the night before Valentine's Day. By the next day it had softened up but truly was tasteless. Sorry

I was looking to use up sour milk and this recipe seemed ideal as I had an old jar of maraschino cherries too. Had no yogurt so I substituted sour cream. This cake is moist not too sweet. I'd prefer more cherry flavor and I think I'll like it better with frosting. (I have a sweet tooth.) Doubled recipe made an 8x8 cake 24 mini-cupcakes and 12 regular cupcakes.
