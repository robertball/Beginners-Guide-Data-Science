USED A RICE COOKER!  i picked up forbidden black rice at Whole Foods bulk section! It's a little pricey. But it was super easy to make. I just threw all the ingredients into my tiger rice cooker and it came out great!!!!!!  I added a pinch of Himalayan sea salt too.  When it was done cooking, It looked like there was an excessive about of water/can coconut milk but I stirred it and it was fine. I doubled the recipe for a big gathering we were going to.  I just unplugged the rice cooker and took it with me and plugged it back in at our destination and kept it on warm.  I used the leftover can of coconut milk and mixed it with COCO Re'al (located in the liquor section of your grocer) for a topping.  You can make it as sweet as you like. I like mine less sweet.  You can also use COCO Lopez if your grocer has it.

I followed the directions exactly at first (although I couldn't find anything called coconut cream, but but a can of coconut milk in the fridge and then skimmed off the top 1/3c). I thought it needed to cook the whole 45 minutes to reduce the water. After it was cooked I added more sugar (probably w/the original 1/3  heaping 1/2c--but I like sweet). I also added, and regretted adding, just a bit of coconut extract. A couple pinches of salt, did seem like a good addition and made it taste more like a black rice pudding I got in a restaurant once.   The dessert is very rich--which is tasty, but I'd be curious to try making it with light coconut milk.

Quite authentic!  However I found I did not have to simmer for 45 min to get it cooked.  25 minutes was sufficient.  The black glutinous rice gives the pudding a lovely purple colour.

Absolutely delish, a gem of an authentic recipe. Thanks for sharing! It was simple, comforting, moorish, best of all, uses an ancient grain that's actually good for you (black glutinous rice is high in fiber + iron + vit E; anti-inflammatory; helps keep limbs warm). 

Agree with the other reviewers that 3C of water was excessive. For it to be more "pudding" than "porridge", try 3C minis 2 TBS of water :) It takes 30-35 mins to cook. 

I'll switch the rice ratio next time to 1/2C black rice + 1/3C white rice and maybe that will be 45 mins.

I serve mine with cinnamon & vanilla ice cream! Next time, I'd try it with coconut or red bean ice cream :D

As the Thai would say, "than hai im, na khrap / kha" which literally means "please eat and enjoy until you are full" (khrap for male; kha for female").

I cut back on the sugar to 1/4 cup and used unsweetened coconut cream. I will definitely make this again. One of the most flavorful rice dishes I have ever made. Coconut cream is the key ingredient.

This was a great recipe - the closest I found to what I could find in the restaurant. I followed a recommendation of another review and swapped the ratios of black to white rice. I like this recipe because it is made with water and flavored with coconut milk versus cooked in coconut milk. I did buy sweet black rice from the Asian market and used calrose for the white rice. Added a wee bit of Saigon cinnamon and forgot the vanilla - served up with some plums on the side and it was delicious. Thanks for sharing!

Reminds me of my favorite vegetarian Thai  restaurant. Yum! I put a good full fat can of coconut milk in the fridge and mix, for coconut cream. Per restaurant, I sprinkle coconut cream lightly with sea or kosher salt
