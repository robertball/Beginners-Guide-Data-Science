EXCELLENT!! While I was at a restraunt, I had this as an appetizer and HAD to get the receipe.  Finding this, I was thrilled to replicate my great "restraunt" meal.  Although slightly more fatty, I doubled the recipe and used regular mayo, a little extra Parmesan cheese (for lack of Asiago available), reg sour cream and added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup.  Served on thinly sliced garlic bread!!  WONDERFUL and my guests cleaned the bowl (keep in mind...I doubled the receipe all except the cream of mushroom soup!).  I think you could also add some shredded cooked chicken if desired.  Either way, everyone was satisfied and will be making again and again.  I am one happy customer! Thank you!

I am always looking for an easy to make 'hot' appetizer that tastes great. I found it all in this recipe. I prepared the dip recipe the day before my dinner party. And then when guests arrived heated up the dip and toasted the bread. Everyone begged for the recipe.

Great Recipe.  I didn't add the Tomato Sprinkles and bought little Garlic Breads to serve with them and it worked just fine.  It is fun, unique appetizer to bring to a party.  Will definitely serve again.

This dip didn't have much flavor and the flavor it did have was not good.  In addition, it didn't look very appetizing.  I won't be making it again.

And to think I almost skipped this one because I didn't know what sun dried tomato "sprinkles" were.  Thank goodness I didn't, because it was delicious.  I used finely chopped sun dried tomatoes, chopped the mushrooms instead of slicing, and added some extra asiago cheese.  The crostini were perfect the day of the party, made two days earlier and kept in an airtight bag.  I made the dip the day before the party and cooked it for more like 45 minutes because it was cold. This was the most requested recipe at the party, always the sign of a winner!

Absolutely mouth-watering!  This dip is SO good -- my guests were practically falling over themselves to get more of it!  No clue where one finds sun-dried tomato "sprinkles" -- my grocery store didn't seem to have a clue either, so I used regular sun-dried tomatoes, chopped them super-fine, and soaked them in water before adding them.  Diced the mushrooms, too (instead of slicing them), so that non-mushroom-lovers wouldn't be offended by sight.  :-)  As far as the crostini goes, it takes no time at all to make crostini and it looks SO much more elegant than crackers -- see "Golden Toast Rounds" on this site if you're not sure how to proceed on that one.  This is SOOOOO yummy!!!!!!!  Thank you!

Heaven on a crostini!!  The combination of tomatoes sprinkles, mushrooms and cheese were delicious!  Next time I will try the suggestion of adding garlic, roasted garlic would be wonderful!  By the way, I have yet to find tomato sprinkles, so I cut sun dried tomatoes into a little pieces.

Note added 3/5/08: Make sure to mix everything well, adding garlic makes it wonderful and roasted garlic, oh man!!!!  Cut the sundried tomatoes with kitchen scissors, but don't cut the pieces too small or too big.  Also, the last time I made this I found out that you can indeed add in too much cheese, I doubled the amount of cheese and it was too much, it made it into a stinky cheese disaster.

This was delicious!  Next time, though, I might skip the mushrooms and add artichokes instead.  The mushrooms really didn't add anything to it.  I also may try another suggestion and put fresh garlic in it.

A wonderful dip.  I substituted low fat cream cheese for the mayonaise and omitted the mushrooms.  I coated slices of fresh baguette with olive oil and balsalmic vinegar and broiled for 3 minutes at 400*F.

This was fabulous.  Had a hard time finding sun dried tomatoes but it was worth the hunt.  Have served this twice and both times the bowl has been scraped clean before the end of the meal.  Perfect medley of flavors.

Based on my guests' reactions when I served this dip as an Easter appetizer, I think I'll be making this over and over and over again.  They inhaled it!  Take the time to make the crostini - - it complemented the dip perfectly.  And I used sun dried tomatoes that I soaked in hot water to softened, then chopped very fine (I never heard of "sprinkles").  Oh, and I added some minced garlic too.  Can easily be made a day or two ahead.

I was able to pull this off in a snap!  I made the dip the night before, adding some cooked shredded chicken and sun-dried tomatoes, and assembled everything right before my guests arrive.  Couldn't be easier or tastier.

I felt this recipes had a little too much of a mayo taste and I could not find the sun dried tomato sprinkles and had to use bagged sun dried tomatoes which I cut up in pieces.  They didn't give much flavor and I really wish I could find the dried sprinkles.  I also served it with fresh pita bread and overall it had a good taste. I rarely had leftovers

Outstanding for any asiago cheese lover! Definitely worth the time to make the crostini too, with garlic, it gives it even more rich and pungent flavor. Got a ton of compliments at my holiday party and many requests for the recipe!

The mayo overwhelmed this dip. In fact that is all I could taste.  To rescue it I continued to add sour cream and asiago/parm cheese until it balanced out. It was better served cold.

Very good and easy to make.  I simply chopped sundried tomatoes to make "sprinkles."  A bit greasy after sitting for a while.  I added more asiago than the recipe called for!  You can never have enough cheese.  Will make again.

Wonderful!  I used sundried tomato pesto rather than bits and it gave it a wonderful flavor.  Served with breadsticks and corstini and was a hit.

This recipe is DELICIOUS.  I've made this a couple times now for different parties and it is always devoured!!  I add a clove of minced garlic and a few shakes of tobasco to heat it up a little.  I never measure the mushrooms, cheese or onions (I always add more).  It is easy and I will    make over and over.

Made this for a wine party to serve with mostly California cabs/mertiage.  Got lots of compliments and no leftovers.  Did not use the mushrooms or sundried tomatoes but used double the asiago cheese and 2 medium garlic cloves.  Served on toasted garlic bread.  Next time I'll only use 1 garlic clove (2 seemed too much), will use the sundried tomatoes (for color and flavor) and continue to omit the mushrooms (not a mushroom fan).  Good recipe!

I've made this dip a few times now and everytime it's been a big hit (i.e. there's not any left). I make the dip the night before to let the flavors blend.  I add a clove or two of garlic and use full fat mayo.  I also add, in addition to the 1/3 cup asiago, 1/3 cup parmesan. As others have mentioned, I can't find sun dried tomato sprinkles either, so I just finely chop whole sun dried tomatoes (not the oil packed).

Excellent dip.  I chopped the mushrooms instead of slicing and it produced a creamy dip that is easy to spread.  Also I couldn't find sun-dried tomato sprinkles, so I used sun-dried tomato pesto instead.   Created a pink color and brought in more seasoning than the original.  New Year's Eve crowd raved about the flavor.

I made this dip for the first time on Christmas.  My whole family loved it!  

I couldn't find sun dried tomato sprinkles either, so instead I used sun dried tomato pesto (about 2 tbsp.).  I just let it drain a little bit on a paper towel before adding it, so it wasn't too oily.  This seems easier than what some others did (finely chopping sun dried tomatoes and then soaking them in water), and the pesto already has a little bit of garlic flavor, so it was perfect!

Oh, I also eliminated the mushrooms, because my mom and sister don't like them and I added about another 1/2 cup of cheese.

Like I said, it was great, and I'm making it again for New Years!

I served mine with crackers, but I like the idea of serving it with garlic melba toast!

Fabulous!!  This has become one of my mainstays.  I have elminated some ingredients that I don't always have on hand for drop in guests, such as mushrooms and sundried tomato flakes, with results that were just as delicious.  I make this over and over.

My father loved it as is! My husband liked it alot too but wished I had used more tomato and maybe a little salt. I also used a combination of crimini, oyster and shitake mushrooms. Definately a keeper and I will have to use it for a get together.

Wow! I can't say enough good things about this dip. It is fabulous, I have already made it 3x in a week. My husband goes nuts over it. In fact I am making it again today for the Red Sox game (GO SOX!). I even added a little minced garlic and more cheese and smothered it on top of chicken breasts then added sauteed mushrooms and broiled them until nice and bubbly...it was so good.
I have never even added the sun-dried tomatoes or the low-fat/light, I have just used regular/whole ingredients.  It is a great compliment to bruschetta also. This is a keeper!

This is a very tasty dip and everyone at my dinner party agreed.  There weren't any leftovers, which is always a good sign!  I didn't have any sun-dried tomato sprinkles, and nor could I find any at the store, so I substituted finely chopped sun-dried tomatoes, reconstituted in water, instead.  This recipe is for keeps.

Wonderful dip!  I used a little more grated asiago and added grated parm just to add a little sharpness.  The quality of mayo is very important, I only use hellmans- if not the oil will seperate and the dip will be too oily.  I've learned that this is the case with any mayo-based dips.

awesome recipe, thanks!

This was a very good dip.  Far from your everyday appetizer.  I took it to a party and everyone loved it.  It was nice for the vegetarians, too.  I added a tsp. of minced garlic and 1 1/2 tsp. of Italian seasoning like another reviewer had mentioned.  I also added much more Asiago than the recipe called for.  I like the taste.  The mushrooms made it a little runny, but still was very good.  I doubled the recipe and still there were no leftovers.  I think that speaks for itself.

Fantastic!  I did opt out of the lowfat version and used regular mayo and sour cream however, chopped the mushrooms(crimini) and chopped 4 sun dried tomatoes after I soaked them for 20 minutes.

Everybody loved this dip - it's so easy to make and tasty, too!  The only thing I changed was I substituted sun-dried tomato pesto for the sun-dried tomato sprinkles (couldn't find them in any grocery store).  Turned out great anyway!  I served it with pre-packaged crostini toasts.  I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe, very tasty, except it is a little to greasy (probably because of the mayonaise). I read some suggestions to use as a sauce for ontop of chicken...yeah, didnt go so well. The dip ended up separating when cooked on top of chicken, probably because the watery juices separated the oily dip. Anyway, it was very yummy, but should stay as dip!

So good.  Three people asked me for the recipe.  I used garlic melba toast instead of makng the crostini because I was pressed for time.  I also had to use paremesan/romano/asiago cheese mix as I couldn't find asiago at the market. Really good and quick to make.

I found that this was a very good recipe to start from since I did change a few things. I left out the mushrooms and sundried tomatoes and added marinated artichokes, parmasean cheese and 2 cloves of garlic. I made this recipe twice doing it this way. The first time I baked it for about 15 minutes and I got "good" reviews. The second time I decided just to leave it cold and everyone loved it.

I doubled this recipie for a party. 1 cup of green onions was horible.  I'm surprised other reviews did not warn me.  i ended up having to triple the rest of the ingridents and adding much more cheese.  With the changes, it was wonderful.  The entire thing was gone.

This really really good, especially with toasted pita wedges. The second time I made it, I added some red pepper flakes and it was even better. Good the next day should you have any left over. (But don't count on it!)

This was terrific - a "non detrimental" holiday dip that I could serve to my friends who are watching their weight.  The dip is also good the next day, too - I made a double batch and left some of it back for the next day.  I used a tablespoon of sundried tomato pesto, because I couldn't find the sprinkles.

I made this for our weekly neighborhood 'happy hour'.  It was a hit and everyone felt ok eating because the recipe came from Cooking Light Magazine.  :)

This was good and everyone liked it...but boy was it expensive to make! I did make a few changes...used 1/2 cup chopped artichokes instead of 1/4 cup mushrooms, and added two cloves of garlic and lots of ground black pepper. I served this with Melba toast, which worked out great and is a lot faster than making your own crostini! I'd make this again, for a special occasion.

This dip is very tasty and was popular at a recent party.  I did leave out the sundried tomatoes (personal preference) but otherwise followed the recipe as is.  I cooked the mushrooms before adding them in hopes of reducing the chance the dip would be runny but it was still a little thin.  It was easy enough to scoop up with crackers so this was not a big deal.  I will make this one again - thanks!

This is absolutely fantastic! I made this for my daughter's birthday party for us "adults" & everyone asked for the recipe & said it was the best cheese dip they'd ever had! I wouldn't change a thing!

A wonderful hot dip. Add a little crushed garlic and take the time to make the toast. Uncork a bottle of Chianti and enjoy!

If you love Asiago cheese, as I do, you will absolutely love this dip.  It is wonderful and full of flavor.
