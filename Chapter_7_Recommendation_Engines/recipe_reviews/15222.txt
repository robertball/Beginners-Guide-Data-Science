THE KEY TO EASY MANICOTTI IS TO JUST BOIL THE PASTA TO HALF THE RECCOMENDED TIME ON THE PACKAGE- THEN PLACE COLD WATER OVER MANICOTTI.  WHEN COOLED, REMOVE FROM WATER AND STUFF WITH PASTRY BAG OR ZIP-LOCK BAG (WITH CORNER CUT).

WOW, WOW, and WOW!  I used ricotta instead of cottage, and I used mozerella/provolone mixture.  Put a lil onion and garlic in with the hamburger while cooking, and WOW!

Ricotta was used instead of cottage cheese.  Having no pastry bags, I stuffed a ziploc baggie with the filling and snipped off one corner.  Added the topping mozzerella at the last five minutes.  This dish was VERY well received!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I made only a couple of changes...substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese and mixed just a little bit of the spaghetti sauce in with the filling mixture.  Don't worry if someone doesn't like ricotta or cottage cheese...blended in, it only adds flavor.  My husband, that doesn't like ricotta or cottage cheese, didn't even notice that it was in there.  I see that many reviewers are commenting on the difficulty of stuffing the manicotti.  My grandmother always said that the best kitchen tool is your hands.  I found this to be especially true with this recipe.  Just hold the noodle in one hand and plug the end with your fingers and stuff it with the other - not rocket science!  You can get them really full this way too.  Make a full dish of this one - don't half the recipe because the leftovers are awesome!!!

This was really good, although I changed it a bit.  I added one package frozen spinach and accidentally put all of the cheese in the hamburger mixture.  Plus, I added more seasonings including parsley, oregano and Italian seasoning and two whole eggs.  I will make it this way again in the future, as it has enough veggies for me (spinach) yet enough meat for my husband.

Very tasty dish!  I added onions while I cooked the ground beef for a little extra flavor.  Anyone who is skeptical of using cottage cheese - don't be - it's better than ricotta, not as dry.  My mom has used that in lasagna for years, I prefer it.

This turned out very well for me.  For the most part I stuck to the recipe, but I did use ricotta instead of cottage cheese, and added 1 egg, garlic powder and onion powder to the cheese/beef mixture.  I used a ziploc bag to fill the tubes of manicotti, which I cooked only 5 minutes, then rinsed in cool water.  They were easier to fill that way, but it's important to fry out the burger (or sausage) and make sure there are no largish chunks of meat, because the finer you fry it out, the easier it will be to use a ziploc or pastry bag to fill the tubes.  The amount of cheese/beef mixture came out just about right for the manicotti.  I liked the amount of a 14 oz. jar of sauce, since I'm not such a great sauce fan, but I rinsed the jar with about 1/4 cup of water, which I added to the pan to make sure the manicotti finished cooking (it did).  I topped it with mozzarella and grated Parmigiano Reggiano, then covered it nice and tight with foil and baked it for about 45 minutes.  I didn't have any trouble with the cheese on top burning!  I guess my top tips are frying out the meat as fine as possible, lining the pan and covering it with non-stick foil, and after you fry out the meat, turn it into a colander and rinse it with cool water to cool off the meat and rinse off any fat.  (Don't forget to let it strain to get rid of the water.)  That way it won't be hot and melt any of the cheese, and the filling will be easy to handle.  It was delicious and there were no leftovers!

The best Manicotti I have made.  I didn't cook the pasta very long and found it was easier to stuff.  The only changes I made was added a little onion as I was browning the beef and salt and peppered it.

Tried this recipe for a large dinner party.  It was a HUGE hit.  A bit time consuming but definitely worth it.  I used Ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, and I spiced up the meat with onion & garlic while cooking it.  I'll be making this again for our Christmas Open House!

My husband doesn't like cheese (he says it leaves a bad taste, yeah, only if it's warm), but he likes ricotta, so I thought this would be a good recipe for him, although I did have to alter it some.  I skipped mixing the the mozzarella in with the meat, and added chopped fresh parsley, and 1/2 tsp. of thyme.  I actually was contiplating making the meat mixture as if I were making meatballs, I wish that I had & next time I will, as the mixture was sort of "loose", probably due to the loss of mozz. cheese.  Well next time I will use ricotta in place of the mozz. and just use a whole egg instead of 2 whites.  But this is a keeper, it tasted like ravioli.  Thanks Steph!

I don't like cottage cheese so we left that and the eggs out and added cheddar cheese instead.  My family had these gone in no time.

I followed this recipe close except I used whole eggs instead of the egg whites and seasoned the meat with garlic pepper. I would encourage everyone to spruce up the meat mixture to your liking. My kids LOVED this. It tastes like lasagna. Also, I took the tip from a reviewer on a different manicotti recipe and used it here. It WORKED and I WOULD NOT lie about it: Do NOT boil the manicotti first. You do NOT need to cook it first. It's easier to stuff it uncooked (I used a pastry bag). Put 1 cup of sauce on the bottom of 13x9 pan. Arrange stuffed manicotti on top of sauce. Add 3/4 cup of water to remaining sauce in the jar, put the lid on it and shake to mix. Pour over the top and sprinkle with cheese. Cover the pan TIGHTLY with foil and bake for 45 minutes. Carefully remove foil (watch out for hot steam), and continue baking for 15+ minutes until cheese is bubbly. The pasta will be cooked perfectly. I can't imagine precooking the pasta......it would be mushy. Don't be afraid of the cottage cheese. It has more flavor and isn't as dry as nasty ricotta:)

Very good! I took the advice of another reviewer and only cooked the pasta halfway.. made it very easy to stuff. I also added a little of the spaghetti sauce to the meat mixture to keep it moist. Will definatly be saving this one!

I used this filling for jumbo shells and thought it was fabulous! Instead of 2 egg whites I used 1 egg and added garlic salt. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I followed previous reviewers suggestions to smash the hamburger very fine and not to leave large chunks. I would strongly recommend this recipe.

I won't rate this recipe because I haven't tried it yet.  I make a similar recipe that includes a 16oz can of Spinach...  Just an option some may like to try.

This was my first time making a manicotti dish. Cooking the manicotti was the trickiest part. I didn't let the noodles even boil and only let it warm for five minutes. This recipe was very good. I doubled the shredded cheese because in my house there is no such thing as too much cheese. Next time I will take the advice of other reviewers and add some Italian seasonings to give it more pizazz. This is definitely a new favorite in my household!

Made this last night, it came out very yummy. I subbed ricotta for cottage cheese because thats what i had on hand. Overall i enjoyed the dish. i seasoned the meat with garlic, basil salt and pepper, didnt have any oregano. next time i think i will add some chopped onion when i cook the meat for additional flavor. it was easy to make, just took a while in the oven. nice dish if you're having a few people over,  i got 13 shells out of it. thanks!

I use sweet italian turkey sausage instead of beef and no boil barilla lasagne noodles. If you soak them in hot water for 5 minutes they are soft enough to fill and roll - it's way less messy than stuffing shells...

This dish was very easy to prepare. I made it as instructed but instead of 1 lb ground beef i used 1/2 lb beef and 1/2 lb ground Italian sausage and added onion and minced garlic! The combination of both meats were SO GOOD!! I will def save this one for later. Also I found that the cottage cheese was a little "loose" so i will try ricotta cheese the next time! Great recipe.

Very Good!  I did what other reviewers suggested and used onion and garlic with the meat, also substituted ricotta.  Most importantly, I used half ground beef, HALF MILD ITALIAN SAUSAGE, and it was delicious!

These were pretty good. My whole family enjoyed them. And I made them exactly as stated. I think with a few personal adjustments this could be a 5 star recipe.

My boyfriend and I made this "together" since we're in a long distance relationship and it was GREAT!  Both of our first times making it and it was good.  The only problem was stuffing them (a bit tedious, but worth it) and the noddles breaking.  I think another reviewer mentioned not cooking them all the way through to prevent them from breaking so that might be a good idea.  If you're a big fan of cheese, you might want to add a bit more also (which I'll do next time around because I just didn't think there was enough; but this was just a personal preference of mine).  Moy boyfriends' turned out good too according to him.

this was amazing, I also used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. I also found that just soaking the noodles in boiling water for 15 minutes and then running them under cold water made it easier for stuffing them. My whole family loved them, and there wasnt even any leftovers!!!

pretty good manicotti. I did make a few changes: used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and 1/2 cup more. I also added a few 1/2 tsp of some different seasonings. The reason I took off a star is because I did make changes. In addition I would also leave the mozzarella off of the top until about 5-10 mins before it is done. This way the cheese will be melted but not burned.

The taste was good, granted, but I followed the recipe exactly, and both my husband and I found the filling to be a bit dry.  I'm sure some of that was my poor stuffing skills, but there was an element of moisture lacking - I will add extra cottage cheese for that next time.

As writen, I have to give this a 4....maybe even a 3.5. I was specifically looking for a manicotti recipe that used cottage cheese since I'm not fond of ricotta. This was good base, but to really get that exceptional taste I'm looking for I will be doing a lot of tweaking. Right off the cuff, I added onion, garlic, and basil. These ingredients seemed to really be missing. Next time, I also plan to cut the beef in half. The biggest problem I had with the recipe is that it was too beefy. A little beef adds interest, a whole pound overwhelmed the flavor so that I could scarcely taste anything else. I also plan to add spinach and mushrooms just for fun. I think I can turn this into a 5 star recipe after a couple more tries.

While this was ok, I found it to resemble lasagne too much. I highly prefer cheese manicotti.
Huge tip.....if you make the stuffing ahead of time and throw it in the fridge for a few hours it is so easy to fill the pasta. I like using shells because they are so much easier to work with.
I used my own sauce, and added a lot of spices to the whole thing.

Filling the manicotti was challenging. One REALLY needs to have a pastry bag in order to speed things up.

Amazing! This was my first time making manicotti and it turned out fantabulously. Instead of boiling the manicotti, I boiled water, placed manicotti in, and took it off the stove to make it easier to stuff. I just stuffed it with my fingers; it was very easy. I also used mild Italian sausage in place of beef which gave it a nice flavor. All in all, a great recipe!

Turned out pretty good! I did add some mushrooms and spinach to the filling because I had some on hand that I needed to use up. A little difficult to stuff the shells, but other than that I liked it.

This is a huge hit! I added a few extra things, for one, a little sauce in with the meat towards the end along with garlic, minced onion, italian season vs Oregano (didn't have any) and the classic S&P. We're huge garlic lovers, and I add over seasonings to all my hamburger so what can I say. We also got the whole bottom spaghetti sauce, top alfredo from another recipe here, works perfectly here! I agree that the trick is to only cook the noodles until they are slightly cooked, they'll cook the rest of the way in the oven. Though I filled mine with a spoon, the pastry bags didn't work for me.

Delicious! I used Ricotta (didn't have cottage cheese on hand). But I know for a fact cottage cheese is wonderful in Italian dishes. This is a little time consuming, but can be made up in advance-which is a positive. Will add seasoning to the meat next time. Other than that, awesome!

This is a similar version that I grew up with - the cottage cheese is much lighter than Ricotta.  I used 1/2 lb of ground turkey and 1/2 lb pork sausage.  I cooked the meat with garlic, shallots and onion.  I make a homemade tomato sauce and a Bechemal  (5 TBL butter, 4 TBL all-purpose flour, 4 C milk, 2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp nutmeg) to go on top in order to enhance the dish.  Fresh parsley is a must.  The flavors are incredible.

I cut this recipe in half because I was just making it for two.  It is so easy and good!  

I used Italian seasoning instead of just oregano, and I used a whole egg instead of just egg white - it came out fine.

I also added a little bit of chopped up onion to the meat while I browned it.

Will definitely make this recipe again and again.

This recipe was great with a couple of changes. The hamburger sounded bland to me so I added a half packet of dry spaghetti sauce mix and it was perfect. I also used 2 whole eggs instead of the whites. 1 whole egg is plenty. If your shells split during boiling, like mine did, split them in half, fill them with the meat mixture and put them in the pan seam side down. This is definitely a keeper.

This is such an easy and wonderful recipe.  As my husband is an avid hunter, we used elk burger instead of beef burger.  I made this for my family for Valentine's Day, served it with garlic bread, a green salad and for dessert . . . Cream Puffs (from this site).  It was a perfect dinner!  Happy Cooking!

Pretty easy to follow, but as always stuffing the manicotti is just a pain!

The changes that I made were to season the ground beef. You can also substitute ground beef with chopped button mushrooms if you do not use red meat making sure to season the mushrooms with Italian seasoning  sauteed  in a little olive oil.  If you spray the foil lightly with your favorite oil, you do not have to worry about the cheese sticking. I use ricotta cheese in place of cottage cheese, because this is usually what I have on hand.  I also use jumbo shells for easy stuffing.

Good basic recipe but I needed to make some changes to make it more authentic.  Specifically:  Added one small chopped onion and 2 cloves minced garlic and sautéed with the meat; used whole milk ricotta instead of cottage cheese and subbed one whole egg for the whites; and added dried basil also to the meat mixture as well as a pinch of nutmeg when mixing into the cheeses.  Baked as directed.  They were delicious served with a green salad and garlic toast.

Very good recipe. I did add garlic powder and season salt to the meat mixture. And 1/2 a small onion finely diced and sautéed with the ground beef. Also didn't use egg whites. One side note. Before you put into the oven cover with foil or the manicotti will dry out on the edges. Uncover the last 15 minutes to let cheese brown. Filling would also be great in lasagna.

Great recipe... However, a little too heavy, so I customized - I used turkey and low fat ricotta and mozzarella. Served with a light side salad, and turned out great!

Trying to stuff this manicotti always is my downfall.  It tastes great even though the noodles are often torn for me. I love this recipe! I add Alpine Touch (only from Montana) and a bit of garlic.  I also add a bit more spaghetti sauce.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Made with one change - used mild italian sausage instead of ground beef...  Excellent!!!!  My guests had 3rds!  Will without a doubt be making again.  Great meal to serve when you're having company since you can make all of it ahead of time, clean up before they arrive and just put in the oven an hour before serving.

Followed recipe, just doubled. I did add onion per other recommendation, but still found it quite bland. was very surprised especially with all that cheese.  will try again as good meal for a group and have to feed 7 kids.

I made this thinking it would be more a more substantial meal, but after making it, I decided the amount of meat suggested overpowered everything else. I would cut down on the amount of meat and make it more of a cheese centered dish.

Great! I also had problems with the shells splitting, and I was careful not to overcook them. Next time I might do as was previously suggested and use large shells. Also seasoned the beef with garlic, onion and pepper and added a little sauce to the beef. DELICIOUS!!!

I used 1 whole egg instead of 2 egg whites (easier) and ricotta instead of cottage cheese.
SOOOO much easier to make than I had anticipated - I was pleasantly Surprised!
Turned out Wonderfully!  My 6 year old loved it along with the 'old man' :)

this dish is super easy to prepare in the morning refridgerate and cook later in the afternoon...I left out the oregano, used 1 whole egg and ricotta cheese, I also chopped up raw spinach and added to the cheese mixture (if you chop it small enough the kids just think it is from the garlic salt) anyway this makes a nice dish that is very similar to lasagna

I gave this one a 5 star because i couldnt give it a 10. The family loved this one (family being me my husband and my 2 yr. old) It was great the only thing i did was added fresh garlic and onion to the meat while it was browning. I took the advice of another review and used a ziplock to stuff the pasta great idea!! It did take two to do it though. I also didnt put the chesse on top until the last 5 minutes and i also added cheddar chesses to go with the mozerella. I loved this one and will def. do it again. Thanks for sharing

I used this filling for shells instead of manicotti and it was delicious! I added fresh garlic and italian seasoning to the meat which gave a nice flavour. The filling looks gross but once you top it with sauce and cheese it looks (and smells) yummy. I used Healthy Choice Garlic Lovers sauce with onions and that definitley finished it off perfectly. Had extra noodles and sauce that I froze for another time.

I thought manicotti was supposed to be cheese filled?  Oh well.  Tried this because I don't like cheese filled pasta...I like a little meat.  This was good.  I wanted a little more italian flavor with this so I would try to add some italian spices next time instead of just the oregano.  I liked the result and will make again.  Thanks for the post.

This was delicious! I seasoned the beef with some dried minced onion, garlic powder, a bit of salt, a pinch of sage, and Italian seasoning. I used both cups of mozarella in the filling instead and sprinkled a little parmesan on top. Did substitute 15 oz. ricotta for cottage cheese, and added a couple of Tbs of parsley along with the oregano to the cheese filling. I used 1 jar of Newman's own "sock it to me" marinara sauce for test purposes. My family loved this! 4.5 stars

Made this last night for my daugher's Italian boyfriend and I'm happy to say that this dish got very nice reviews from the gang. I used sausage instead of the beef and ricotta in lieu of the cottage cheese. Made my own sauce but couldn't use the pot I would have liked to because at the moment, it's full of Polident. Smells real pretty tho. Steph, hubby was especially pleased because he's not fond of the "cheese only" version of manicotti. Thanks so much!

I loved this recipe. I didn't use any meat. I had all the other ingredients on hand but instead of manicotti shells I used lasagna noodles and folded them over to make pockets! It worked great! Instead of tomato sauce (which I don't like) I cooked it plain and then topped with homemade alfredo sauce Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce. Turned out great!

This recipe was very good. I do think that the filling would have tasted better with spaghetti sauce in the beef mixture. I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese, but other than that used the listed ingredients. I only boiled the manicotti for 5 minutes before stuffing it.  We took the leftovers to family and they raved about it. Will probably fix this again. Thanks.

This was tasty, but I served two manicotti dishes for a special meal, and the other definitely won out (the "easy manicotti florentine" from this site).  It tastes fine, but it's not quite as interesting as some others.  Maybe with more spice...I did use onion, garlic, and fresh oregano, but I should have used more.

Pretty good, but I agree with other reviewers - spice it up! I think using sausage would be great instead of the hamburger. It's a good start to what could be a great meal.

Very nice. I have also varied it by changing the ground beef and using itailian sausage. Also for less mess you can replace manicotti with jumbo pasta shells. They are easier to fill.

GREAT recipe! I fixed it Christmas eve for company and it turned out fabulous.  One twist that I used: I added one package of pepperoni slices that I had put it my food processor - (ground it up like bacon bits). You might try it! Also be sure not to use too much sauce - just enough to cover them while leaving the ends poking out is enough. 

THANKS for sharing the recipe!

Very good recipe.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  I ran out of stuffing with 3 tubes left, so I would recommend being generous with the hamburger and cheese so you don't end up with extra shells.

Not much flavor - even though I used Italin sausage instead of hamburger.  Something is missing.

I have made this recipe as is and it was pretty good.  I do not cook my pasta before hand, I fill the noodles, put them in the pan and add a half a can of water over the noodles and sauce.  They're perfectly cooked when the dish is done.  This time I made it with part beef and part hot Italian sausage, it was good as well.

I made this and immediately made a couple changes. First I   use mild Italian sausage and because the sauce was already Italian I just added some onion peppers and mushrooms I like to oven fry some eggplant and Warm Italian bread with plenty of garlic and butter.

5 stars with changes. I  added a little hot Italian sausage to the beef. 2 whole eggs instead of just the whites. 3 Tbsp of tomatoe paste to the mix as well. I also added both minced onion and celery to the meat. Along with a clove of minced garlic. Like others, I half boiled my noodles. Sprinkled the top with a little grated parmesan with the mozzarella. Baked covered for an hour , remove cover and a quick broil to brown up the cheese.

next time I will be more sauce, it was a little dry.  tried both ricotta and cottage cheese.  ricotta held together better, but cottage cheese was creamer.  I also added spinach and loved it.

This is the first recipe I have used that the meat is cooked before filling the manicotti. It was very good. Although I did do a few tweaks of my own. Nothing major, made my own sauce and a little extra meat. I topped it with some shredded cheese and Parmesan. It was very tasty. I will add it to my cook often list!

I just finished eating this recipe. Excellent!!!  Will be making it this way from now on. Cheese and meat mixture is SO much better than sauce and meat mixture. I used 90% lean ground beef and ground turkey (50/50 mixture). Also, I used that Kraft shreaded mozz cheese with cream cheese in it.. EXCELLENT !!

Thank you for sharing this - we LOVE this recipe  - it has replaced lasagna at our house! I use the whole eggs (we love yolks), sub 1/4 beef for sausage, add a couple of tablespoons of fresh parsley, a medium onion sauteed, a Tb of each garlic and onion powder, and black pepper to the mixture --- tonight we tried the italian blend shredded cheese in lieu of mozzarella and it was a good switch. I also par boil the noodles based on the reviews & cover with tin foil until the last 15 min. Thank you again - you're a star for sharing this with the world!!

Sooooo good. Cottage cheese is a must as it is more moist than ricotta. If you made it with ricotta now make it again with the cottage cheese. I made homemade pasta lasagna sheets and used them for a manicotti roll-up. Much easier than stuffing tubes and makes the pasta delicate and light. Thank you for this incredibly tasty dish.

I am trying to start cooking more often, and don't really have a lot of experience with anything but the most basic dishes. This one looked a bit complicated for someone of my skill level, but I tried it anyway. I couldn't find manicotti shells, so I substituted cannelloni instead. Other than that everything went according to plan, and it turned out really well. I will definitely make this again.

Very nice results.  I filled the noodles uncooked. I topped it with a white sauce - like Alfredo sauce then covered that win tomato sauce and left it overnight. This added moisture and flavour

I have never made manicotti before so I looked at the tips and ratings first. I substituted ricotta cheese instead of the cottage cheese, added parm and jack cheese too. I loved it. thanks for the basic recipe! its a new fave in the house!

I used Italian sausage instead of ground beef. It was delicious. I think it could use more sauce than called for in the recipe, too. I'll probably double it, next time. Overall, I think this is a great recipe.

I made it and added garlic, black and red pepper to the beef, plus a bit more sauce than the recipe called for (for reheating). Turned out great and will make it again. Is there a reason I can't add the yolks?

I made just as in recipe, and it was delicious. I decided to stick with cottage cheese because I am not super fond of ricotta's grittiness, and I am so glad I did.  The only thing I would try different next time is to cook meat with onions &/or peppers.

I went with a few revisions after reading reviews.. first I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.. then I did as some others suggested and did NOT boil the noodles first, and also just used 1 whole egg instead of the egg whites.  I just used a plain "traditional" jar of spaghetti sauce.  I will try this again and use a different sauce, or add more herbs to a plain sauce.

I love this recipe, but stuff jumbo shells instead (way easier). My boyfriend and I prefer it with Alfredo sauce instead of tomato, never any leftovers!!

I haven't ever made manicotti before, but I made this one and another plain cheese recipe last night. Both were AMAZING and super simple to follow! The only thing I did different was sub ricotta for the cottage - not a fan of cottage cheese, and it is wonderful! Is a huge hit at my house and will be making it again!

This was a great recipe. The mixture is alot so I suggest that you make two dishes of it and freeze one for a later date. I would also recommend adding an extra cup of sauce for moisture. All in all it was very good and everyone enjoyed dinner tonight.

Yummy! I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. 
For the filling, I used the egg whites and cheeses with ground beef, mushrooms, red onions, and spinach. I also added minced garlic, onion powder, black pepper, chili powder, oregano and basil. I mixed my leftover "stuffing" with the remainder of the spaghetti sauce and poured it over the manicotti, baked for 40 min, then added shredded mozzarella and shredded parmesan in the final 8-10 min. 
It was beautiful and delicious! Will make again, probably for company.

I made this exactly as indicated and found the dish a little bland - too much meat and not enough flavor.  I like the idea of using sausage and/or spinach.  I'll probably use ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  The suggestion to boil the shells for half the time worked great.  They were easy to fill and finished cooking in the oven.  I'll definitely be tweating this one a little bit.

Easy to do with great results. You can adapt it to fit what you have in the cupboard/freezer. I sauted onion and garlic and used italian sausage. I did have to add more sauce.

This recipe was quite yummy.  I used a tsp. to fill the noodles.  A suggestion would be to take the noodles out of the pan after you drain them.  I left mine in, and the ones on the bottom stuck together, so they tore.  I used the filling to kind of "glue" them together, which worked out fine.  Overall, the experience and the taste was fantastic!  TY

This is a great base recipe. I added my own personal assortment of meat and vegies to the mix because I felt that it would be a little bland as is.

I have to give it 5 stars because the taste was great and it was easy to prepare. But I must  give myself 2 stars for cooking the shells.. ha ha they pretty much all broke. 
I added more seasonings and only 1 egg as someone else suggested.

This was the first time I've ever made manicotti and I love this recipe! I read all the reviews and tweaked here and there--used nearly a whole 12 oz. box of jumbo shells instead of manicotti tubes, didn't need to use a pastry bag just a spoon (maybe I did something wrong?), added spaghetti sauce to meat mixture...overall a hit! Only thing I'll do next time is have more sauce on hand--otherwise EXCELLENT, EASY and VERY TASTY RECIPE! :)

As I also made the easy manicotti florentine from this site, I had ricotta left over from that. So I subbed half ricotta for half the cottage cheese. I also added in garlic powder. Very enjoyable. Thanks.

Didn't find that this manicotti was very flavourful, but the filling was easy to prepare, so it's definitely a good base. Will try again, but will play with the seasoning next time.

We really liked this recipe but we substituted Italian sausage for the hamburger.  It turned out wonderful as well.
