We doubled the recipe & added 1 can black beans (drained & rinsed), 1 can of diced tomatoes, some diced onion, diced garlic, cilantro & about 1/2 c frozen corn. I mixed it all up, baked it until hot and bubbly & served it with 6-inch tortillas, fresh sliced avocado, sour cream, shredded cheese, salsa verde & fresh lime wedges. It kept it inexpensive, still & turned it into a complete vegetarian meal. Some taco seasoning (or enchilada sauce, fajita seasoning, or something of the like & some shredded chicken would be good additions too. Thanks for the simple, inexpensive starter recipe!
