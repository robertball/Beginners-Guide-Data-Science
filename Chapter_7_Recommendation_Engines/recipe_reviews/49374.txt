These are delicious! A few changes: I definitely needed to add a cup plus a dash more of breadcrumbs to get the whole thing to stick together... I'd recommend starting with 1/2 a cup and adding more slowly until you get a good texture for rolling the burgers. Also, I agree that the curry might have been a little much, and may try cutting some of it in favor of more cumin and maybe some paprika next time. However, the cooked mushrooms and scallions are a wonderful touch and the burgers were great! (Crumbling problems can be solved by rolling the balls very well between your hands before flattening them into burgers.) I served mine on a sesame whole grain bun with tahini and a big slice of tomato, and put some greens tossed with a little more tahini on the side. I'm definitely saving this recipe!

I loved this recipe!!  Since I'm not a fan of mushrooms, I eliminated them  added 2T. flour and about 1/4c. oats to fill out the mixture.  The texture was ideal for falafel, and was delicious served on whole wheat pita with sliced tomato and fat free sour cream.  Will definitely make again~

I think I would have liked this recipe even better if I would have left out the curry. It seemed to overpower the other flavors. I only used 2 tsp. 1 1/2 Tbls seemed like it would be too much. I served it on pita bread with yogurt sauce and veggies. My husband liked it too.

I tweaked this recipe a bit to make falafel balls.  I ground fresh croutons umbs in the fodo processor to get about 1 cup of bread crumbs, added the drained chickpeas and discarded all the liquid, one white onion, 6 cloves of garlic, a hand full of fresh parsley, salt, pepper, cumin and a dash of red pepper flakes and gave it a whir in the food processor until it formed a really dry mix then added 3 medium eggs- one at a time to get a cookie dough consistency.  I used my cookie scoop to make the balls and then rolle dthem in bread crumbs before giving them a dunk in the deep fryer.  Served with a cucumber, lemon and sour cream sauce.  They were a hit.

These were very tasty but they need a few minor changes. First, I would drain the chickpeas and reserve the liquid, then add a little at a time until you get the right consistency. I used the whole can and it was very loose. I added more bread crumbs to "firm" it up, but that made it taste too "bready." I didn't have any mushrooms when I made these so I substituted grated carrots. It was delicious and gave them a little more color. I will definitely make these again! Thanks, Jojo!

Very good. Took a lot of work for a novice like myself, but all in all worth it. I baked instead of fried to make it a little healthier, and served with spicy mustard. Yum!

These were delicious!  The only thing I changed was that I added 1/2 tsp. of a mediterannean spice blend instead of the curry powder.  Next time, I would also eliminate the water from the chick peas so the mixture would stick together better.  My husband loved it too, and I will definitely make it again!

This recipe is amazing! I had never made falafel from scratch until trying this out, and it exceeded my expectations. I didn't have cilantro or curry powder on hand so I left them out, but it was still great without them. I also broiled the patties in the oven with brushed on vegetable oil rather than frying. They got nice and crispy with less fat required! I then stuffed the patties in pita pockets with sliced cucumber, tomato, avocado, and fresh spinach with a lemon tahini dressing. DELICIOUS. I will definitely make this meal at least a few times a month from now on! Even my meat-loving husband loved this vegetarian recipe!

They were very yummy. 
I had to add more breadcrumbs and one more egg white to hold it all together.
And didn't add as much curry powder either.  I made small patties and served them with Tzatziki. Everyone loved them.

I tried it twice, in case I had messed up the recipe initially, but no. These babies crumbled like feta.

Also, the cooking process was a tad dangerous. Maybe a deep fryer would have worked better.

My husband and I really enjoyed these. Instead of making burgers, I rolled them into smaller balls to make falafel balls instead of burgers. We really liked them :)

Awesome!  Instead of keeping the juice in the chickpeas, I juiced a lemon and added some lemon rind, they were great!

I actually added a little more egg white to keep the batter together AND I added some minced up greek olives! Whoa, awesome! (not sure why one commenter said that it was dangerous frying food, but maybe they should get in the kitchen and try cooking a little more often. It gets less scary the more you learn ;-)

These are so yummy.  I made them with 2 cups dried chickepeas (soaked over night, boiled for 1.5 hours) and discarded all cooking water.  I added a little coriander seed (ground) and some chili pepper (not much).  I increased the amount of mushrooms, onion and breadcrumbs to get a cookie dough consistency.I used two whole eggs as I couldn't be bothered separating the yolk from the whites.  Unless you are watching your cholesterol, there is no need to separate out the eggs.
Instead of frying, I brushed the patties with a little olive oil and broiled for a few minutes until browned.  They turned out nice a crispy without too much oil.
We will definitely have these over and over again since my 15 month old son LOVES these. They are great with tzatziki and/or in a pita with lots of veggies (tomato, lettuce, olives...etc).  I am sure they'd be good as 'veggie burgers' too.

Really good.  We combined a couple of recipes.  We didn't have mushrooms, but they'd probably be really good.  Also, used 2x beans and no eggs.  Pan fried one side, then flipped and finished in the oven.  Even the kids enjoyed it.   Served on pitas w/ lettuce and Trader Joe's Tadziki sauce.

This was very good.  I had never had falafel before and was really glad I tried it.  I did take others advice and cut the curry down to 1/2 t.  I used 1 whole egg instead of 2 whites and it turned out great.  Will definitely make this again!

Pretty good.  I used eggbeaters and cumin/coriander/cayenne instead of curry.

Served it in whole wheat pita with yogurt sauce and raw onion.  Family liked the addition of mushrooms as a change from the usual falafel.

This recipe was a pleasant surprise.  I added an extra egg and half cup whole wheat flour and I kept the patties small and they held together.  What a great way to get gabanzo beans into your diet.

These turned out too mushy, even after I doubled the amount of bread crumbs.  Otherwise flavorful and very easy to prepare.

Very good. I left out the mushrooms because I did not have any at the house. I read all the comments about leaving out the curry powder. I would suggest a red curry powder instead of yellow. Very good although a little crumbly. I grilled them after frying in the skillet on the grill. This would be easier if they held together better. After looking at some other recipes a bit of flower might help with this.

These burgers are absolutely amazing, but only if you serve them with MAYO. Without mayo they are still good but with mayo they are great. Cheese is also good but not as necessary.  Also, you need more bread crumbs than the recipe suggests!

my daughter who is a vegetarian, realy liked these, but I also found them too sticky to handle after adding extra breadcrumbs.  I put my hands in flour before shaping them.  Will definitely have these again, without the curry.

These are unbelievable! I skipped the green onions and traded the mushrooms for some whole wheat flour to thicken it up. Served with some homemade tahini sauce in pitas and they're a huge hit!

Delicious recipe!  I added a little bit of cayenne pepper (about 1/4 tsp.), and only used 1 tablespoon of curry powder.  Also used some extra bread crumbs to help everything stick together.  Turned out perfectly!

This was great. My husband and I both loved it. I, like the other reviewers added more bread crumbs. Other than that, I follow it exactly. Try starting with 1/2 cup bread crumbs and slowly adding more until you get a cookie dough like texture. Then try frying 1 to see if it crumbles. If it does fall apart, you need more bread crumbs. Simply delicious!

2 stars only due to lack of flavor. They held together great, but the consistency was like pablum warmed through-did not get firm or crispy at all. They also tasted mostly like breadcrumbs. For future attempts will add-major cumin, salt, bell-pepper for flavor,tahini or (more)garlic and less breadcrumbs.

This was a great recipe.  I only used 1 tsp. of curry as others had suggested and that seemed like it was just the right amount.  I drained half of the liquid from the beans but I ended up having to add almost a quarter cup more bread crumbs to get the right consistency so next time I'm going to drain all of it.  So good...

These were also yummy.  The ideal consistency was really challenging.  Would add only the liquid from 1 can of garbanzo beans instead of both.

These were good. A nice healthy dish. They needed some sort of sauce to jazz them up- but other than that they were great. Because I don't like to fry things, I made patties, froze them, and then put them on a medium heat skillet frozen. They turned out perfectly crispy on the outside, just like if they were fried.

Great recipe!! Really easy too. As with the other raters, it definitely needs at least another cup of bread crumbs to hold everything together.  Ohterwise, I like it just the way it is.  I'm adding this to my favourite recipes book.  Thanks!!

Had to do a little tweaking to make this work... I reduced the amount of curry to about half a tablespoon. Had to add extra bread crumbs because the mixture was super gloppy. Next time I might leave out some of the chickpea liquid to try to compensate for that. Overall, very delicious and will make again!

Left out the curry, due to personal preference.  Served with Tzatziki Sauce (Yogurt and Cucumber Dip), also from this site.  Makes a great sammie!

These were delicious and very satisfying!  Our blended beans had a bit more liquid so we added more bread crumbs to help dry up the mix.  Used Garam Masala instead of straight up curry powder which was fantastic.  Next time I'd add even more bread crumbs as they stayed quite soft in the middle.  We doubled the recipe to get 8 patties and wound up with around 14 'burger' sized patties - but we're happy for the leftovers!

You need to drain the liquid from the garbanzo beans!  This was way too runny to form anything, and we had to increase the amount of bread crumbs and mushrooms to compensate for the excess liquid.  Taste was good though.

This was my first attempt at making falafel, and I found it to be a perfect recipe to start with. I, too, found that more bread crumbs were needed to make the patties hold shape, but they taste divine! I made the patties much smaller and refrigerated them so I could reheat them for my toddler's lunches, which worked very well.

This was really yummy and whipped up really quickly.  I drained the chickpeas, used a bit more garlic, along with about 1/2 cup of quick cooking oats and at least 1 cup of breadcrumbs to get it to a consistency that looked right. Made little "balls" with 2 spoons and deep friend them till golden.  They didn't quite get as crispy as I would have liked.  I served them in pitas with tzatziki.  Delish!

This was my first time making Falafel, and I will definitely make it again! I think I had too much liquid in my mixture so I needed to add extra crumbs. Next time, I'll just make sure less liquid goes into the garbanzo bean mixture.  My boyfriend and I ate our falafel in pita pockets with lettuce and tomatoes.  It made a healthy meal, nice to eat on the porch with, and definitely fun to make!

Very good! Batter wasn't easily "shape-able" so I just placed spoonfuls in the pan to begin the cooking process--and as they cooked they held their shape. I used "Nature's Own" garbanzo beans to cut back the amount of sodium in the recipe too.

Delicious! I added 1 Tb tahini to processor, and halved the curry, and it was perfect for me.FYI- everything went into the processor (breadcrumbs last) except onions and mushrooms, which I stirred in after every thing else was mixed.This recipe is a keeper.Thanks, Jojo!

Pretty much followed the recipe, but omitted the mushrooms (for my husband) and substituted 1/2 cup oats and 2 tbsp. flour as suggested by another review. I also only added some of the chickpea liquid. The burgers came out crisp on the outside, but the texture inside was a little too mushy and didn't remind me of a "real" falafel. With a little tweaking I think it could be better.

I loved the texture and flavor, but hated how messy they were.  I think perhaps next time I'll add less bread crumbs so that they stick together better.  I served them with a sour cream/lime juice dressing on whole wheat potato rolls.

I agree that this does not taste like real falafel.  It's not bad, just not very authentic.  I also had a hard time getting them to stick so more breadcrumbs were needed.  Won't make this again, it was not worth the work.

I did use only 1 1/2 tsp of curry (because I can't imagine using more than that in this recipe), and not only did they taste nothing like real falafel, but the consistency of the patties was just plain mushy.  i will never make this one again.
