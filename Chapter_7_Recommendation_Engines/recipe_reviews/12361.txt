I am going to give this a better rating cuz I could tell it WOULD have been great had I not slaughtered it.  Part of the reason I messed up though was my shopping list did not have some of the detail needed.  Because of this and for other reasons - I made some substitutions.  I also was not thinking and when the recipe called for preserves in the pot - I was (stupid me) thinking rasberries...not the jam! DUH!  ok..but despite some mashed rasberries that I layered with (and by the way - I think I liked that boo boo cuz it did not affect it much and then I was not jamming the topping into the rasberries so that it would stay put - it layered nicely.  (I will do that again (break up the rasberries a bit)  The other thing to consider is the cost of rasberries of that amount - I paid $15.00 for my rasberries at 2.99 a container that had a little over a cup.  Marie Calanders would have been less expensive!!!  This is also a lot of work.  But anyway..in the end - I could read through the lines and think..." This WOULD have been delicious but pricey!  I also used Cherry extract instead of the kirshwasser - I have no idea how different that made it - but like I said the flavor was good - so that item worked for me. Good luck...I will probably try it again!

Made this for my husband's birthday--beautiful, wish I'd taken a pic BEFORE adding the streusel:-)  Used raspberries and strawberries--went to Total Wine and bought a 99cent bottle of raspberry liquor instead of a $30 bottle of kirschwasser or framboise--great buy!!  Only utilized about 1/3 of the streusel, but saved the rest for over ice cream.  Kind of putzy, but well worth it--delicious!

Delicious! I added a bit of vanilla sugar and a dash of nutmeg to the streusel after it cooled and also used strawberries and blueberries. I'm going to try this with mini tarts next time.
