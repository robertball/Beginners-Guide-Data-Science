I made this for my husband last night and we both thought it was pretty good.  The topping needs a little bit more sugar and it may be good with a bit of rolled oats.  For those of you who don't like it so tart, but don't want to add more sugar, you can try a species of rhubarb called 'Strawberry' or 'Cherry.'  Most people have what's called 'Victoria.'  It's only red from the ground to about half-way up the stalk and is green for the rest.  The strawberry version is a dark red from the ground to the leaf.  The red version is much sweeter.  It is still rhubarb so it's still tart but not nearly as much as the 'Victoria.'

I doubled the recipe and used a 9 x 13 inch pan.  Even though the recipe was doubled, I could have used more rhubarb.  I used Splenda instead of sugar in the rhubarb itself.  It was very good tasting, but next time would like to tweak it a little and use more rhubarb and not so much cornstarch because it did become too dry.

This was fabulous!  My kids thought they hated rhubarb because it grows in the garden -- they cleaned their plates.  I topped it with ice cream while warm.  One thing to note -- the recipe summary says this cooks in a 9x13, but the actual recipe says a 9" square pan.  I used the 9" square and the ratios seemed perfect (topping to contents).  The topping was very good, too!  I will make it again and again.

The filling was great - I added some blueberries to the mixture too.  I didn't care for the topping - it was more cakey for my liking. If I make it again I would down size the pan to an 8 x 8 so you would get more filling with each bite.

This is a great summer dessert, especially served warm with vanilla ice cream.  Even my rhubarb-hating husband liked it!  Next time I might put a pinch (or two) more salt in the flour mixture.  I recommend using Penzey's Ceylon Cinnamon in this recipe, that particular unique cinnamon really enhances the flavor of the rhubarb filling.  It takes a good recipe for rhubarb to thrill me, and this one did it.

I made this in a ceramic pie plate that is a bit bigger than a deep dish pie plate and it was the perfect size.  I made mine with frozen rhubarb so I omited the water when cooking the fruit.  I pre-baked it before supper and then popped it back into the oven during supper so that it would be nice and hot for dessert.  Everyone loved it.

I would absolutely double this recipe if you're using a 13x9 pan.  In fact, next time I will triple the fruit portion and double the topping portion.  The whole family loved this...even the rhubarb haters!

This was fast...easy....and you need no special ingredients. It calls for what you already have in your kitchen cupboard. Basic is sometimes the best! I added about a 1/2 tablespoon extra of water as some folks commented it was dry. This was not dry...it set up to perfection. I did not decrease the baking powder (and I was happy I didn't). I think the "too much baking powder" comment some have made could be coming from the fact that rhubarb ALWAYS makes your teeth feel coated - kinda squeaky after eating it. It's just the nature of the beast. I did add about 3 drops of Mexican vanilla...because I bake nothing without it...lol

Almost as good as Grandma's! I've been looking for a good rhubarb cobbler recipe, and this was very tasty. The only thing is, like many other people said, there was too much topping in comparison to the filling. Next time, I'll make more filling (maybe even double it) I also added a few tablespoons more sugar to the filling mostly because the rhubarb is just coming out in the store, and I figured it might be tart. Good recipe overall.

I suggest that after the filling cools a bit to taste for sweetness. I used 2 cups of sugar since i doubled the recipe and it was very tart. I will try it again but with more sugar.

This recipe is very good! I change it up a bit by using 10 celery-sized stalks of rhubarb and a pound of fresh strawberries (chopped). I keep the amount of sugar the same, but add about a tablespoon more of cornstarch to the mix since I use more fruit than the recipe calls for. The biscuit topping is so tasty! I switch up sprinkling it with white sugar or brown sugar depending upon my mood. I've made this cobbler about 4 times, and it's always a hit!

Wonderful! It was gone in a day! Makes a good breakfast if you use whole wheat flour and cut down on the sugar with the rhubarb. Make sure to use a 9x13 pan not a 9x9 as the recipe states.

Doubled the filling, 9x13 pan, nutmeg in filling, cinnamon sprinkled on top. Yum Yum Yum!
Even better with ice cream or whipped cream. Good as a leftover too.

Rhubarb pie used to be my favorite fruit dessert...now it is rhubarb cobbler.  I made this recipe for the first time, sat down with a bowl of it to watch a movie and the next thing I know, I ate the WHOLE thing!  I had the most terrible upset stomach all night long, but I am making this again tonight.  I have alka seltzer standing by this time.  : )

I'm eating this right now at work (the day after I made it), with a cup of coffee.  Incredible combo - and tastes just as good the next day.  A great way to use up a garden full of rhubarb!

I brought this to a BBQ and everyone loved it! I got compliments and it was gone by the end of the night. We ate it with vanilla ice cream. The only change I made was cutting back on the cornstarch (I used 1 1/2 T) as other reviewers said. This is definitely a recipe I will be making again!

I thought it was very good..definately easy to make.  Mine came out a bit on the tart side but vanilla ice cream helped sweeten it up..yum!  My husband and son didn't like it as much as I did, which surprised me as they eat everything!  I will probably try it again...next time I'll add strawberries to the rhubarb.  Thanks for sharing!

This was our first time for cobbler.My husband and I both loved it.Super fast and delicious.Two days later I wanted to try peach cobbler. Since this one was so good I just used a large can of sliced peaches, reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup,added a bit of nutmeg with the cinnamon and followed the recipe from there.It was as good as the rhubarb.Thanks Jill!!

This was really good, but I would double the recipe. Both the rhubarb and the topping were very sparse in a 9x13 pan.

Excellent! I wasn't sure if the rhubarb would be sweetened enough or cooked enough after just 20 minutes, but it was PERFECT!

Excellent simple recipe.  I've made it several times now.  If you use strawberries, lower the amount of sugar.  If you use blueberries, you'll still need most of the sugar.  Also, you can cut the butter a bit and you can use milk without egg to dampen the dough.  Using the egg is pretty much a waste of egg and milk, because you only need about 2 or 3 tbs of the liquid.

Jill, your recipe is delicious!  The only thing I would say is that I also feel the next time I make it, I will probably make either 1 1/2 or 2 times the amount of filling.  I did also put it in a round casserole dish after reading the reviews.  It is a great rhubarb recipe.  Thank you for sharing it...:)

Thank you for sharing this recipe. It was absolutely delicious!!!! Next time, I plan to double (even triple) the filling portion.  My husband usually doesn't care for rhubarb, but he really loved this recipe. I can't wait to make it again!

Absolutely delicious...even my husband(who is not particularly crazy over rhubarb) loved it.  The only thing I did differently was baking it in a  9 X 9 pan.  It worked perfectly.  This recipe is a keeper for our family!

Yummo! Added a handful of strawberries because it is Spring. Also added a couple of drops of red food coloring to make the fruit a pretty color. Thanks for sharing Jill!!

This was good. I left the sugar amount the same in the rhubarb mixture, but increased the rhubarb to 5 cups.
I increased the sugar in the topping to about 1/2 cup. Turned out great!

Very delicious and easy to make.  I added a cup of blueberries and it was fantastic, but would be excellent with just the rhubarb.  Next time I might double the topping because I really liked the topping.

Awesome convertible recipe! I used blueberries instead, left over from last years' harvest in the freezer, and I used a deeper casserole dish than the recipe called for. DH will worship you for this; mine did.

So delicious! I added about a cup of strawberries and that helped cut the tartness of the rhubarb. I thought this was perfect and the crust was especially good. Only change was to add about 1 Tbsp of water to the fruit mix.

Mmmm...delicious!  I added a can of cherry pie filling over the rhubarb once it was in the baking dish and before the topping was dropped on, but otherwise followed the recipe.  It was simple and I can't wait to run home from work to have another helping after dinner tonight!

I doubled the cobbler part of the recipe after reading the other reviews because I wanted to use a 9 x 13 pan - Excellent - everyone loved it!!  I served it hot from the oven with ice cream, mmmm good!!! Great for feeding a bunch - I fed 7 and still had some left over for lunch the next day.

This is so good you really should double it, especially if you use a 13X9 pan. I am going to make this from now on instead of rhubarb pie so I don't have to deal with soggy crusts.  The cinnamon is a great touch!

I made this for a bruch with my parents. They loved it. I added some pepper to the fruit, and some ginger to the topping. I added some extra  butter to the topping and it came out a little dry.

I really like this.  Easy and a great way to use up fruit.  I really like the topping.  You could make it with any cut up fruit.  I tried it with peaches, strawberries and blueberries.  It was great.

This was a little dry my first attempt so next time I substituted instant tapioca (1Tbsp) for the cornstarch and increased sugar by 1tsp.  In addition I added 1/4 cup of dark raisin (Thompson's) which gave this a slightly different flavour and made it a bit thicker.

This was a very good recipe, although I found it a little bland. Might be better with ice cream.
I did add an extra tablespoon of water and cut the cornstarch to 1 1/2 Tbsp. as per others comments that it was dry. It turned out beautifully with just the right amount of moisture.
If serving with ice cream I would double the filling or cut the topping in half to balance the tart and calm influences.

This cobbler was very good.  I baked it in a 10 inch round casserole dish.  Next time I'll use
1 1/2 cups sugar since it was too tart and more cornstarch because it was too runny.  Good ratio of filling to topping.

I had never tried rhubarb before making this recipe, but it is now one of my favorites!  This recipe was easy to make and delicious.  I used a 8x8 baking dish as others had suggested because the filling does cook down a lot.  At first I thought it was a mistake when the recipe only called for 1 tablespoon water, but when the rhubarb cooks a lot of liquid cooks out.  I served this warm with vanilla ice cream and it was gone in 15 minutes.

Made tonight with left over strawberries that were very sweet.  I think I would add more sugar if it was just the rhubarb alone.  I think the recipe was corrected; don't use the 9 x 13 pan anymore.  I used a ceramic oval pan and didn't have to alter the recipe.  I might mix the cinnamon into the flour mixture next time as it was a little plain.  Other than that it was great for garden rhubarb.

The filling is definetely the best part about this cobbler. The crunchy part/dough on top stayed a little "wet" where it touched the filling- I don't know what it is that i did wrong....other than that, very good.

Very good, I added two peeled sliced apples, next time I will double the "fruit" ingredients as everyone said that was the best part.

slicing the rhubarb makes this a recipe that is not very kid friendly,also the use of the top of the stove is another reason.

I added a can of Cherry pie filling to the rhubarb and the filling to make it more as the amount of rhubarb I had was not quite 4 cups.  This worked well.  The topping could have been a little more too as it doesn't cover much.  Was very good tho and I'll certainly use again.

Other than the balance of filling to batter being out of proportion this looked very appealing coming out of the oven. Vibrant color, crusty golden topping – I couldn’t wait to dig in.  Unfortunately I was disappointed from the first mouthful.  First, there was not enough filling for the topping, though used a smaller pan size, 8x8." It could have used 1-1/2 times the filling ingredients.  Next, there was too much cinnamon.  Rather than a subtle hint of cinnamon, this was overbearing.  One half teaspoon would have been plenty (and should be mixed in with the cornstarch and sugar, not sprinkled over the filling in the dish which would sure be tricky!)  The topping tasted like a cracker, for lack of a better way of putting it. Not lightly sweet at all, and on the dry side. Seems to me more butter and more sugar were in order.  Finally, it could have been juicier, even coming straight from the oven (and I only baked this for 17 minutes).  I can only imagine how much more that will be emphasized as it stands. A little less cornstarch or a tad more water certainly would have alleviated this.  All and  all, this was a big disappointment.  So glad I made ice cream to serve with this.  It should help mitigate its flaws.

I used my own cherry rhubarb filling, but needed a topping, this was perfect and easy.  I added a splash of vanilla and some crushed walnuts and it came out great, husband wanted thirds.

I made this for my 93-year old mom who loves her rhubarb. I was too lazy to make a pie, so I tried this instead. And of course I had to taste it before I take it to her. :) 

I used half rhubarb and half strawberries and used ground flaxseeds in place of the egg. It's still warm and tastes perfect to me. Thanks for the recipe - my mom will love it!

I really enjoyed the simplicity of this recipe.  I went from picking the rhubarb to eating the cobbler in less than an hour.  I felt that it needed a bit of something else to balance it out.  The next time, I will try vanilla.  If that isn't it, then perhaps ginger.

This is delicious! I've made it several times and it is so easy to make. In addition to following the recipe, I've added apples and strawberries to the mix. I even made it using just a 1/4 cup of sugar on the fruit and it was still very good. This is heaven when warm and served with ice cream!

Made this last night and we loved it!  Turned out perfect in a 8x8 square pan.  Used a little more rhubarb than called for.  Make sure you use rhubarb that is red all the way up the stalk to the leaf for best flavor.

This recipe is fantastic.  Hope others enjoy it as much as I do!  The only comment I would like to point out is that the top says it's for a 9x13 pan and the recipe portion states 9inch square. Definately use the square pan or double the recipe.  I just pulled it out of the oven and can't leave it alone even though it's piping hot!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe! :)

This is the first rhubarb cobbler I could ever say was absolutely a five star dish. Doubled the rhubarb, but left the rest of the recipe as was and the whole family thought it was the best ever. Thank you so much for sharing!!!

This was my first experience with rhubarb and I will definitely use rhubarb again.  Thanks for the ever-so-easy recipe! The dish turned out great. I used an 8X8pan, 3 cups rhubarb and one cup strawberries. Everything else went unchanged except I omitted the 1T water to ensure that it wouldn't be 'runny' as some other reviewers complained. I don't see why you need water at all; just keep stirring and the rhubarb makes its own juice. I left it unrated because I am personally not a big fan of cobblers.

nice and tart. I did not have quite enough rhubarb so I added some blueberries. Probably would be good with a blend of rhubarb and strawberries or apples. As always I used whole wheat flour to increase the fibre. And I used vanilla sugar. very tasty!

Excellent!!!  I think I like it as well as Rhubarb pie and so much easier.  I did take someone elses suggestion and added a little cinnamon to the topping.  I didn't have any more rhubarb or I would have made more filling as many people suggested.  There was quite a bit of topping but it was still great!

It tasted a little like apple cobbler, but with the tartness of rhubarb.  Easier than rhubarb pie and tasted great warm with ice cream on top!  I'm sure I'll make it again.  My family all liked it.

Delicious!!! Add a bit more sugar, and the vanilla ice cream when it’s still hot makes it perfect.

Absolutely yummy! I did add some strawberries because I had some I needed to use. I also subbed xylitol for the sugar because my husband is diabetic. I added oatmeal to the topping just to give it more fiber. My husband loved it so much he asked for another one before the first one was even gone.

It was great, love the light fluffiness of cake on top. However, I would use twice as much rhubarb and adjust sugar next time as it was out of proportion.

The only thing I felt lacking in this recipe was the fruit to cake ratio.  Double the fruit and it would go from good to fantastic.

Really delicious! Not too sweet, still has a tangy rhubarb taste. I threw in some strawberries since they needed to be used & sprinkled the top with brown sugar & cinnamon. Thanks for the great recipe, I will definitely make it again!

I have had a rhubarb plant in my backyard for 7 years, but never did anything with it because I thought I hated rhubarb. Well actually, I hated someone else's rhubarb recipe. THIS rhubarb recipe is awesome. I made it exactly as given. Thank you for changing my mind about rhubarb!

Made this twice, as rhubarb is plentiful at local farmer's market this month. First time exactly as written, second time with a dash more cinnamon and some leftover strawberries added. Delicious both times.

Loved this cobbler.  I added a layer of fresh blueberries on top of the cooked rhubarb.  It was wonderful and I will make it again.  Exactly as I expected for a cobbler.

Easy and tasty. My kind of summer dessert!  I threw in a bunch of blueberries as I didn't quite have four cups of rhubarb. Turned out fine and was a pretty colour, but I really don't think this recipe can be messed up. I loved it.

I adjusted the rhubarb amount as advised by some reviews. I increased the rhubarb to 6 cups and sugar to 1 cup, a little more corn starch.  It turned out perfect.

This was really good - next time I would use even more fruit - there was a lot of (delicious) yummy cakey cobbler topping that could have used more fruit.  Also, probably b/c I used 1/2 strawberries, it was overly sweet even though I did reduce the sugar called for.  But definitely a keeper and we'll use it again and try different fruit, too!

I doubled this recipe as well.  I added canned peaches to the rhubarb.  YUM.  I also didn't have any milk so I used butter milk.  Worked well and was really great.  Going to bring it to our friends for a dessert.

This was excellent.  Easy enough and tasted great.  I did add 1 small box strawberry jello as part of the sugar.  I used bakers sugar for over the dough and used maybe 1/4 cup.  I used an 8x8 inch pan. It did take 30 minutes instead of 20 and thought the topping would be hard, but was extremely tender.  I will definitely make again.  Very good way to use rhubarb. Delicious!

I served this dish warm, with ice cream, and my kids really liked it. I doubled the recipe, per others' comments, and I used 1/2 strawberries and 1/2 rhubarb.  Using the strawberries seemed to produce more liquid, as it wasn't dry at all.  I would definitely make this again.

I think I over compensated with the sugar because I was afraid of the tartness everyone talked about.  My crust was a little thicker than I'd like. I added strawberries to the recipe which might account for the extra sweetness.  If I were to make it again, I think I'd leave out the strawberries so I could actually sample what the rhubarb taste like with no cover-up fruit. I used a round casserole dish. I think it will go great with my morning coffee :-)

I have made this for the family at least 10 times. The kids love it and so do I. love the filling, it's best hot with vanilla ice-cream. The crust though, could used more sugar. But over all, it's delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!

I absolutely love this dessert and it was so easy to make! I can't believe it!! I was short a bit on the rhubarb so I added some peeled and diced apples to make up the 4 cups of fruit. I love cinnamon so sprinkled lots in. It was just perfect... the sweetness, the amount of topping and the consistency of the rhubarb/apple was all perfect! Thank you for posting this one!

I used the basics of this recipe (actually the only thing I changed was that I used blueberries instead of rhubarb because the latter wasn't at the store during my last-minute Christmas shopping). It still turned out great though. Just sweet enough and the biscuit-like top made it special!

I used 1 package of remlinger farm rhubarb and just doubled everything else aside from sugar topping. I only used a total of 3 talbe spoons. I also cooked in 9x13 pan and it took about 30 minutes to cook. It may have taken longer because I had to go to town and buy milk when I went to mix the topping I noticed I was out so the filling had time to cool. We both loved this one. It would be good mixed with other fruit but if I have enough rhubarb I will make it this way.

This was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly. I baked it in an 9" round baking dish. It was my first time cooking with rhubarb so I chopped it up pretty small just in case the flavor was a little disagreeable I wouldn't get a chunk of it. It turns out we really liked it! The dough/bread part is really light and sweet. I think I'll be using it with my other cobblers.

Very Yummy!  We are health nuts, so we substituted soy for milk and honey for sugar.  We also used apple juice instead of water.  YUM!  Next time we will make it vegan and substitute the apple sauce for better and banana for egg.

My first attempt at making a cobbler.  It was a hit.  I added some green apples that need to be used up to the rhubarb. This will definitely be added to the family repertoire.

Easy and delicious.  I'd definitely double the filling next time, there wasn't enough in comparison to the amount of topping.  I used 2 c apples and 2 c rhubarb, because I hadn't picked enough rhubarb, and it was really good that way (used a few Tbsp sugar instead of the 3/4 c).  We had vanilla ice cream on top, too - I highly recommend adding that!

Oh man I LOVE rhubarb.  And I love cobblers.  So I was destined to like this recipe.  I did double the dough part of the recipe, but I only needed about 1.5 times the ammount in the original recipe.  yummmmm.

This is our new favorite rhubarb recipe.  I made it with egg replacer - the only change. Delicious!
