I was worried that this recipe would be more difficult than it actually was. This really was simple.  I only made one change and that was using evaporated milk in place of the heavy cream in the syrup only because I didn't have any. It didn't make any difference in the end result. What a great weekend treat. We loved it. I only wish I'd doubled it right from the get go, everyone wanted seconds!

This is a quick and tasty breakfast. I substituted buttermilk for the regular milk. We skipped the toppings, but would definitely try them in the future.

Quick. Easy. Tasty. I know this was all about the caramel sauce topping, but since I didn't have any I sauteed the bananas and used maple syrup in place of the caramel (and I skipped the cream). Making this again!
