What a lovely breakfast.  I cut the fat by a huge amount and used four egg whites instead of two whole eggs (1 egg has approximately 5g of fat, vs 1 egg white which has only about 0.2g fat).  I used frozen spinach which I cooked before adding to the egg mixture.  I used fresh chopped onions instead of onion powder, because I had them on hand so why not?  This is a very good basis for a spinach omelet, and you can easily tweak it to your own liking.  A great way to incorporate veggies into your diet.

Very good omelet that's god for you too! Instead of using onion powder I sauteed some onion and then added the spinach. I cooked that until it was wilted. I added a little milk to the eggs before adding them to the veggies and threw in a couple cherry tomatoes cut in half for a little color and flavor. I left out the nutmeg altogether. When it was all done I seasoned it with salt, pepper, and shredded Parmesan cheese. Great with whole grain toast!

Beautifuly delicious! I added a bit of milk and onion to the egg mixture, and actually used shredded mozarella cheese because I didn't have anythng else. WOW! My hubby loved them! For presentation, I sprinkled a bit of spinach and shredded cheese on top . I will be making these often!

Spinach omelets are one of my favorites and something I make for myself often, slightly varying what I put in them each time. On this occasion I sauteed chopped onion in butter, added the spinach and cooked just till wilted, added the eggs, cooked them until almost set,  then topped with the Parmesan (just a sprinkle), some  shredded Provolone and chopped tomatoes before folding the omelet over. Mushrooms also would be a great addition.  I'm familiar with the combination of nutmeg and spinach which is used often in Italian cooking, but I don't care for it so chose not to use it. (Even so, the amount called for seems like nutmeg overkill - it's flavor should be VERY subtle)  I omitted the onion powder as well.  I would suggest not using the full amount of Parmesan, at least to start, as 1-1/2 T. seems like an awful lot for just two eggs.  Similarly for the onion powder, which I wouldn't use at all, let alone 1/4 teaspoon.  Good start to a great spinach omelet with some modifications.

This IS awesome....I was a little skeptical about the nutmeg, but it turned out great!  I used egg beaters and also added a chopped roma tomato.  Ate it with a 1/2 whole wheat bagle.....Great way to start the day, thanks Holly!

I really enjoyed this recipe.  Four weeks into the south beach diet and the last thing I want is another egg, but this made breakfast very enjoyable.  I especially liked the touch of nutmeg!

Not bad!  I added chopped green onions, a tbs or so of milk, half a roma tomato and some garlic powder to the mix, and subbed mozzarella for parmesan, then topped it with a little cheddar at the end of cooking, and folded over omelet style.  It was quite good, and filling!

This is one of my favorite breakfasts.  I leave out the nutmeg (not a favorite of mine in savory dishes).  If I have leftover veggies from the night before (mushrooms, onion, etc) I add them sometimes.  I will try the Provolone cheese, as suggested by another reviewer soon too!

Excllent recipe. I also was skeptical about the nutmeg but it was perfect.  I used parmesan and provolone cheese and it was delicious. My whole family gobbled it up.

Awesome, the nutmet really does add an interesting hint of flavor and keeps it interesting.  I do prefer the more frittata approach to the folded omelet...it tastes more fully cooked.   I made this with probably twice as much spinach, give or take, because I love the green stuff.  I also added a splash of half and half to the egg mixture for a little additional fluffiness. I thought I'd rather have a gooey cheese, but the parmesan was actually just right, as it turned out!

Wow....who knew nutmeg could be incorporated into an omelet? and it is freaking fantastic! I used egg whites only as I had 4 leftover from a bread baking session, and added mushrooms because to me, when you have onions and spinach, mushrooms just HAVE to be invited to the party :) I too used chopped onion and sauted the veggies and then poured the eggs (whisked with S&P, nutmeg and a tich of milk) overtop.  Cooked on the stove until the bottom was set, then finished it under the broiler (no flipping required) - awesome breakfast and extremely low-carb using the egg whites. Thanks for the recipe! really is awesome with the nutmeg...:D

Baby Spinach Omelet Haiku: "Blissful eggy dish. Almost perfect as written. I'll make this again!" Only small changes that I made were to lightly-saute a little diced onion (instead of onion powder) in the skillet and tossing in the spinach to barely wilt before mixing all the eggs and seasoning together. Also, 1/8 tsp of nutmeg, while seemingly scant, really would over-power a 2 egg omelet, so I opted for a pinch. I might use 1/8 tsp. if I were making a 6+ egg quiche, but not for a small single portion omelet. My omelet didn't make an attractive "flip and fold", as much as it just wiggled into a crepe-like snake, but oh wow, appearances aside, this was insanely good. I typically over-stuff my omelets w/ every veggie that I can unearth, but this simple combination of spinach/parm/onion (and that whisper of nutmeg) is beyond heavenly.

Made this recipe just as it has been presented and found it to be a little bland. I believe that omletes are made on a whim, at least mines are, using whatever ingredients are on hand but with all egg dishes, assuring myself, that I never omit the  nutmeg, so I may offer a tip to budding chefs, unless you are absolutely sure that the ground nutmeg you are using is very fresh, then grind your own (invest in a nutmeg grinder). Nutmeg, starts to lose flavour within days of grinding, so for omlettes and certain other recipes I always use whole nuts and grate directly into the dish. For cakes and some sauces where ground nutmeg is called for, I grind it very fine in my nutmeg grinder. Note; there is a remarked difference between grated and ground. Same goes for Parmesan, grind it from the fresh block.

Don't fear the nutmeg!  It is a classic in steakhouse style creamed spinach and a natural here.  Be like Alton Brown and buy it whole and grate it with a microplane just when you use it.  Thank you HollyJune, I would not think of rewriting your recipe, it is perfect as is.  If I want to do something else, I'll submit a new recipe.

Mixed in chopped green onions and grated fresh Parmesan cheese. Yummy! Ladies, a great way to increase your Iron intake too. Make sure you eat with some Vit. C (e.g., OJ) for maximum iron absorption.

Yum! I added some sautéed mushrooms and onions and paired it with a fruit salad. I didn’t notice until later that I sort of misread the directions because I beat the eggs, added seasonings (and some milk), then made the omelet traditionally with the filling in the center. I’ll try it your way next time! Thanks, HollyJune, for a great recipe!

A great recipe, everything went together so perfectly.  I would try it the original way first, then make any changes you might find necessary (I won't make any).  Even my boyfriend, who doesn't care for spinach, gobbled his up.

No excuse for not eating breakfast with this easy recipe.  I fried it in one of those 11" flat griddle pans which is perfect.  Roll it up in a low carb tortila and you are off and running. 
Actually netmeg in spincach is very Italian and wonderful. I don't know why you couldn't make up a few of these and stack them on waxed paper for a few days in your frig. New definition to grab and run.

This is DELICIOUS. I used fresh chopped red onion instead of onion powder. I think it would have been good with tomato, so maybe next time. I'll make this again!

Followed the recipe to a "T".  My 4 year old son, with his mouth full, said, "YOU ARE AN EXCELLENT COOK, MOM!"  My 3 year old daughter waited till her plate was cleaned and said, "That was a Yummy dinner.  You are a great cook, Mom!" Hubby loved it too.  Not a bite left over anywhere. So, thanks a million for making me a star in my home! ?

Very easy and tastes so good.  I'm not a fan of nutmeg so I left it out.  You can sub feta cheese for the parmesan.  I've even added tomatoes and red pepper.  Great recipe to add in your favorites.

I thought this tasted pretty good. I used a well packed cup of spinach and sauteed it lightly in the pan with a tsp of vegetable oil and a minced garlic clove and then poured the ingredients over it. I added a good pinch of salt but no pepper. Mine definitely was not thick looking like the picture. It was more like a French omelet. I will more likely make this again with some fresh spinach. TY

Surprised at all the rave reviews for this recipe as presented. WAY too much spinach. Next time(and there will be a next time, as this does have potential) I will use half the spinach and saute it quickly to wilt before adding to eggs. Also substituted about a tsp. of fresh chopped scallion for the onion powder.

Glad I tried this as I was hesitant at first adding nutmeg.  I was really happy I did because it was DELILCIOUS!  I didn't have any spinach on hand so I used cucumber slices and it was also very tasty and had a bit of a crunch to it which I like!  Thanks for sharing this recipe with All Recipes!

Excellent omelette. I used 1/2c egg whites for each omelette and followed the directions otherwise. I did sprinkle a bit of cheddar cheese for a bit of gooey cheese in the center. Nice brunch with a salad.

this was really good!  And so easy.  It is a good jumping off place for add-ins.  I put chopped tomatoes on top after I cooked the omelet.

So good!  I wilted the spinach first, and sprinkled Monterey Jack cheese on top when the omelet was done, and it was wonderful!

I wanted to sneak some veggies in my morning and this was suprisingly good.  I made mine with one whole egg and one egg white to make it slightly healthier.  Although i can't speak for the nutmeg because i skipped that part.  Will def make again!

I love this recipe and of course, made a few mods anyway.

How is the sodium content so high?

Thank you!

This was excellent. I used three egg whites, I sauteed onions, fresh baby spinach and some cut up roma tomatoes, and then added the egg whites and some salt and pepper. It was extremely tasty and kept me full most of the day.  A new healthy start to the day.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I wanted to make the dish healthier so  I used 4 egg whites instead of 2 whole egg.  I also used feta cheese instead of parmesan.

I love spinach! I used 3 eggs (2 eggs plus one whites only) added a tab of butter cooked little minced leeks I had as leftover, threw in the bag of organic baby spinach, two small thinly sliced mushrooms. I added a roma tomato, cut up, then put eggs in. I did not add the nutmeg and onion powder, just salt and black pepper. I sprinkled just a little cheese on top and folded over to let everything set. A good way to start off my morning with a Spinach veggie omelet!

Really yummy .... and healthy too!  I added mushrooms and used diced onion instead of onion powder.  I have made it (and enjoyed it) several times already!  I used grated fresh nutmeg for the first time ever due to a reviewers comment.

This omelet was so good, and low calorie.  I wasn't sure how it would come out with the spinach, but it had great flavor.  I will definately be making this again!   I added a small amount of sharp cheddar inside and it was perfect!

This was really just 3 stars for me but I gave it 4.  It just had too much spinach in it for me but I wanted to be fair with my rating since if you are a spinach lover you would probably like it.

Quick, easy, and absolutely delicious. THANKS!

I did modify the recipe just a bit though. I added a little mozzarella, diced about a third of a roma tomato and about an eighth of a red onion (but still used just a pinch of onion powder), and left out the nutmeg. 

To keep the omelet from being too runny, I sauteed the tomatoes and onions separately and added them to the omelet just before I was ready to fold and flip it. 

Also, I highly recommend using a griddle. Not only is it easier to flip the omelet, but also I have also found it easier to control the heat (but it might just be that the degree settings makes more sense to me than my stove settings, 1-9).  

Set the griddle to 300 degrees, toss the onion and tomatoes on one side of the griddle first then prep and add your egg to the griddle. The tomatoes and onions will be ready to add to the omelet by the time you're ready to flip it. 

Once plated, I sprinkle dried parsley for presentation.

Though simple, this recipe changed my breakfasts forever!  I have always flipped my omelets and the trick of leaving it on to cook 3 minutes a side has not only made my omelets tastier but more attractive too.  Thanks!

Delish!  I was wary to try because of the nutmget, but it tastes great.  Used egg whites in place of one of the eggs and added a little bit of feta. Very yummy!!!

I had never tried spinach with nutmeg so when I found baby spinach at my grocery store (I live in a country where it is rarely available) I was excited to try this--very yummy. I must say that I skimped on the spinach because a cup seemed like too much but then wished I'd put more. I did wilt the spinach with some onion before mixing it in (no onion powder and I was afraid the spinach would not soften enough) and I did a 1 egg, 3 whites combination to cut the fat. Yummy!

These were so healthy and easy.  I do prefer them without the nutmeg though.  Next time I might try using cheddar cheese and salsa.  Mushrooms would be good in there, too.

So yummy!  Even my 2 & 5 year olds liked it, which is quite a feat.  I made this almost exactly according to the recipe, just added in some roma tomato.  This is one of those great recipes that you can customize and play around with and make your own.  The nutmeg added a really nice flavor, I really suggest at least trying it once before foregoing it.

YuM! I love spinach! I didn't use the Parmesan cheese or the nutmeg because I forgot the recipe at work. I did remember everything else though. I added a little garlic powder in with the onion powder. Beforehand, in the omelet pan I sauteed a few slices of baby Portobello mushrooms in a bit of margarine. I removed them from the pan, sprayed on a little cooking spray and began cooking the egg spinach mixture. Before folding the omelet, I added the mushrooms and a little cheddar jack cheese to the center and then folded.

I thought this was very good!!  I made it as the recipe stated with the exception of adding a few diced cherry tomatos to the mix, and I substituted fat free mozzarella for the parmesan cheese.  Served with a little hot sauce on the side.

This was . . . okay.  Hardly tasted the spinach (though that might not be a bad thing to some).  Easy on the pepper and the nutmeg.  This is a good idea, but not 5-star-worthy.

I followed this recipe exactly (only substituting thawed frozen spinach for the fresh since it was all I had).  It was my first time successfully making an omelet, so I was pretty proud of myself.  It came out nice and fluffy, and not runny in the middle (which I was afraid of). My only complaint was the flavor. The addition of nutmeg seemed a little strange to me, especially so much, but I went along with it.  I wasn't overly thrilled with the flavor. The nutmeg is so overpowering in this dish, and didn't really add a nice flavor to this omelet.  I will definitely make this again, since it's a great way to get more greens in your diet, but I'll leave out the nutmeg and maybe substitute my own spices next time.

I'm giving this omelet 5 Big stars not only because it was very tasty and quick and easy to make but because it looked so nice as I served it.  The eggs cooked so nicely with the spinach and mushrooms( I added some) I turned the heat down to prevent burning allowing the eggs to fully cook in the centre...added some shredded cheddar cheese and served it for dinner with garlic bread... Excellent...I'm thinking of making it again tomorrow...I got ooh's and awes from the family that it looked so nice... Thank you!

Sounded great...and worked out really well! The one crappy thing about this site is when people give their opinion about what should change about a recipe...don't look at these recipes/use them if you have your own recipe that you already enjoy. In fact, POST YOUR OWN RECIPE, then people can stumble upon it of their own free accord and decide whether or not your cooking decisions are "overkill" or need to be "omitted."

I loved this. I'm eating low-carb and really needed something different to do with eggs in the morning.  Spinach and nutmeg go so well together, I can't imagine skipping the nutmeg. I just used a medium skillet and filled it with fresh regular spinach, salted & peppered, covered, and let it wilt while I beat the eggs with the onion powder, nutmeg, parmesan and a splash of water for fluffiness, then poured over the wilted spinach. This is super quick, easy and very tasty. It will definitely be in my regular rotation, thanks!

This had good flavor (I left out the cheese), but I felt like something was missing (probably the cheese :P). But actually, it seemed kind of dry-maybe adding tomatoes or real onions would have helped?

This is a great baseline recipe.  I didn't have any Parmesan cheese so I used feta instead.  Since I used feta I subbed some garlic powder for the nutmeg and added some tomatoes to the mix.  It was delicious!  Thanks for such a great recipe to work with.

This was so quick to make and soooo delicious!  I love spinach in my omelet.  I used mozza cheese rather than parmesan b/c I already have too much cheese in my house and couldn't justify buying more.   I will try it with parmesan another time but in the mean time it was DELICIOUS with mozza.  Thanks for the recipe!

Nice recipe. I like my eggs a little fluffier, so I think next time I will add some milk. I didn't have onion powder, but did have onion. I sauteed them to a nice golden brown, then added them when I poured the omelet mix into the pan. Will def. make again, but may try some mushroom to give it a little more filling.

This is really easy. The only thing I did was measure the amount of spinach by weighing it on my scale and found that it was a LOT of spinach to egg, so modified and had only three gm of spinach, and then balanced with fruit. VERY YUMMY. I think though next time I may add some salsa and see if that makes it even better!

Good basic recipe.  Fix as is for earlier in the day.  Add more spices and vegetables if eating for brunch.

Really great flavor with the spinach and spices, though I omitted the nutmeg, not a fan. I also used fresh shaved parmesan instead of grated for a little more flavor.

Very good! May have decreased seasonings a bit and made into a scramble.

Thought this was a good omelet, but called for way too much nutmeg. A pinch would do it imo. I also decreased the amount of spinach, added a little minced garlic and accent seasoning. Minced onion might be good in place of powder too?

This is truly a delicious and filling omelet! I was a little skeptical about the nutmeg at first since I'm not very fond of it, but it turned out to make the dish quite unique and flavorful. However, instead of parmesan cheese I used mozzarella since it was the only cheese I had on hand, but I feel that it was just as good. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was a simple and tasty breakfast for one! I used four egg whites instead of two eggs and used a cup and a half of fresh baby spinach because I'm a big green fan ;}  Couldn't find the nutmeg (tragic because I was excited to taste the different flavor it would have given an omelet) so instead I used an Italian season grinder. Mmm!

green onions in stead of onion salt, Grape tomatoes and feta cheese on top. Some red skin potatoes and a half teaspoon of garlic cooked with the onions for ten minutes is an option

Wow!! This was the best omelet I have ever tasted! This was incredible! The nutmeg makes the dish; DO NOT LEAVE IT OUT! also, I cut the fat by using two egg whites instead of one egg.

This was a hit in our house! I threw in some leftover chopped-up chicken to add an extra protein boost, and it worked very well with the spinach and Parmesan flavors. This omelet could take many variations and add-ins and still be delicious!

Excellent flavor! I loved this. I really liked the nutmeg flavor with the eggs so I sprinkled quite a bit more on my plate. I didn't think I would even like the spinach and was expecting to be picking it out on my plate, but that didn't happen. In fact, I even liked it and will definitely make these again! Thanks for the great recipe!

I added some chives and mushrooms with the spinach but I didn't like the nutmeg that much, so the next time I made this I added Cayenne pepper. It was a prefect wake up morning breakfast. Tasted perfect together and I will definitely keep making it!

I added an egg white to this because the spinach seemed to overpower the egg while I was mixing it. This was my first successful omelet, which earned this recipe an extra star. I'm not a fan of spinach+egg, but this is still pretty good. I can understand why people like it so much.

By making this recipe, I was attempting a recipe that I had tried at a restaurant called ChezCora (very popular in Canada).  It was a spinach omelet inside a pancake, rolled and served with hollandaise sauce.  It was really good but pricey.  I am happy to say that this omelet is really similar.  But wow, the amount of spinach is way too much.  I used half a cup instead of 1.  I also added milk because i wanted it thinner since I was going to serve in in a pancake and SWISS cheese on top of the cooked omelet.  Two thumbs up for this recipe!

This was good.  I would double the spinich (I was afraid it would be too much! but I hardly tasted it.)  I followed the recipe and at the ended added some shredded cheddar/jack cheese and it was a great addition.  Next time I will add a little bit of sliced jalapeno and if I'm not in a hurry will saute some frest diced onion first too.

I tried this recipe out this morning, and it was a good enough dish. I'll probably make it again since it was easy (and healthier than a donut) but I think it needs just a touch more flavor.

I made this for new years day brunch. I changed the recipe a bit but it came out amazing. I sauteed onions, mushrooms and bell pepper, and wilted a bit of the spinach in that mixture. Then I created the egg mixture according to the recipe. I felt there wasn't enough egg mixture to accommodate the full amount of spinach. So I added 3 eggs instead of 2. Added a bit of unsalted butter to the pan and cooked omelette per directions. I added some cherry tomatoes on top and slice avocado. It was the best omelette I have every eaten and made on my own. This recipe has given me the confidence to stop wasting money paying for omelettes. Give it a try.

I used what I had on hand (frozen spinach, Romano cheese from a canister) and added a little plain, whole-fat yogurt. Served with buttered saltines, this was a great lunch for me and my baby.

I recently learned that coconut oil (which we were always told to stay away from) is actually good for you - the brain loves it!  Anyway, I used coconut oil to saute fresh chopped onions, then added baby spinach leaves just until they softened.  In a separate bowl, I whipped 2 eggs, added the Parmesan cheese and black pepper.  I poured the egg mixture over the spinach and allowed it to set, flipping it one time. Left out the nutmeg because I'm not a big fan of it. This was one of the BEST omelets I've ever had and will definitely be making it again.  
These were the BESTi

Simple and healthy breakfast. I ate this every morning for months! I do like to add some sliced olives to balance the plain eggs taste. And if you use large eggs, I recommend using 3.

I don't know HOW this ingredient combination is so awesome, but this was probably the best omelet I've ever made. I substituted egg whites and cooked some chopped onions for a couple minutes beforehand instead of using the onion powder. SOOO GOOD. It must be black magic, I tell you!

V. good recipe as it is, though I admit I didn't have any nutmeg so I can add nothing to the great nutmeg controversy.  I love spinach!--probably added double the Parmesan though, and more black pepper than most people. . .

This is an easy and delicious recipe. The nutmeg really is wonderful, don't skip it. I use eggbeaters to provide a low fat yet tasty meal.

Fast, low carb, delicious. I thought I was tired of eggs, but this recipe changed my mind. My 13 year old son liked it too. I sautéed onions and wilted the spinach in a bit of butter and olive oil, and used it as he filling, omitted the nutmeg and onion powder, sprinkled the parmesan cheese, coarsely ground salt and pepper on top. Beautiful presentation, healthy, delicious. Thank you so very much!

Loved this recipe, it's been a great base for several variations. Great with Swiss instead of parmesan.  My favorite is with Pecorino Romano for the cheese, does not need any salt as the cheese is salty enough and gives a great flavor. Love it, love it, love it!

I have been making spinach omelets for a good while. I start with one strip of thick cut bacon chopped in small pieces, sautee until brown remove from skillet, wipe oil from skilet leaving just enough to sautee the diced onion. Then just as with this recipe, mix all ingredients in a bowl. Pour in to skillet cook for 2 minutes flip and cook for 2 more minutes, I like my omelets moist. Great recipe but for me an egg without bacon in just plain naked.

I am sure this might be perfect as is but I love my veggies in my omelets and I cook for 2.  Here's what I did...  3 eggs beaten with 2 tbs milk, 1/3 cup onion and 1/3 cup grn or red pepper both chopped, 1 minced garlic clove, 1/2c chopped tomatoes, 1/2 c grated Swiss cheese.  Heated the fry pan with oil, saute all veggies til tender with salt, pepper and nutmeg. Split in half veggies, set aside veggies.  Spread veggies around fry pan.  Pour eggs over veggies and cook till nearly done.  Put reserved veggies over half eggs, then sprinkle Swiss cheese over veggies.  Fold over other half of omelet.  Cover and lower heat and cook til cheese melted and eggs completely done.  YUMMY

This was good - I had to use egg whites (3) and felt the amount of spinach was perhaps a tad bit heavy for my personal tastes.  I ended up simply scrambling as it was too difficult to make into an omelet.  I omitted the salt as I felt the parm cheese gave it enough saltiness, but I was left screaming for some kind of a sauce.  I ended up stuffing eggs into a whole wheat pita and (as I was out of salsa) squirted a tad bit of chili hot sauce ..... YUMMMMM! (well, as far as healthy food goes lol).

This was pretty good. I found it a little bland though, next time I will use garlic powder instead of onion powder. Three minutes per side was perfect for me.

so easy! i am also one that is afraid of making an omelet and never used nutmeg before...i used it(i don't use measuring tools) probably about 3 dashes of it, substituted the onion powder for garlic powder, mozzarella(had no parm) and it tasted awesome! i felt like adding a little spice so after it was done i put about 4 dashes of red pepper flakes, folded it in half, then put 2 tablespoons of mild salsa with some fresh ground black pepper on top. will make again and again!

I normally can't stand omelets, but this tasted like gourmet fare.  I loved the dash of nutmeg and Parmesan cheese.  I also added a scallion and a splash of milk, and I substituted garlic powder for the onion powder.  Will definitely make again.

Light and Delicious! Has Gourmet flavors. Perfect to serve for a bruncheon And because it cooks so quickly it makes the spinach very flavorful and not overcooked (wilted) with just the right amount of bite left to the spinach.  Note: 2 eggs is enough for a "not hungry" person - make with 3 eggs for a hungry person  Also light enough for someone who needs to eat who has an upset stomach!!

This was delicious! I love having omelettes in the morning or any meal. I usually have the same thing most of the time. Either bell peppers or mushrooms on the inside. I had carrots and spinach in my fridge, and I already had a carrot omelette before and wanted something new. I wasn`t sure how the spinach would taste; I know I can be overwhelmed by it when I make a salad, but it was perfect. I left out the nutmeg and grated some light babybel cheese and put that in the center of the egg. When the cheese melted, I folded over the egg. Wonderful combination! I had this with two pieces of whole wheat toast, an apple, and a small glass of skim milk for a well-balanced meal. Perfect way to start the day =D

This recipe is SO full of flavor, I couldn't believe it! I also added a couple tablespoons of skim milk, fresh ground pepper, a tiny dash of ground sea salt, and Cholula(the hot sauce with the wooden cap).  That's a favorite of mine in many egg dishes.  I added some sauteed onion once, but the dish was so good without, I don't even bother any more.  I also didn't think that a whole cup of spinach was necessary.  I just grab a handful of leaves and tear them up.  Delicious!

Delicious! I made this as scrambled eggs instead of an omelet. I love the slight nutmeg taste... it is different but very yummy.

Yummy, my husband made this for me and he is not usually the best cook. The directions were easy to follow, and the result was wonderful. The only thing that he did was add provolone before folding the omelet over and served with whole wheat toast. Wonderful way to start your day.
Thanks!

This was really quite tasty. The only thing I would change next time would be the cheese. I think I would prefer something a little 'gooey' in there instead of the grated parmesan. I did use garlic powder instad of onion powder (personal preference). Thanks!

YUM.  Easy easy easy.  And yeah the nutmeg is a great touch.  Instead of onion powder I sauteed a garlic clove in the pan before adding the rest of the stuff.

I have been making these for a while now.  I skip the nutmeg (not a favorite) and substitute Cavendar's Greek Seasoning, I also add some crumbled Tomato/Basil Feta cheese.  So incredibly yummy!!!!

Update... very very good. I made myself put the nutmeg in and it was fantastic. I made as directed using every ingredient as written and measured everything out precisely. I will make again and again. Hubby said it wasn’t hearty enough so next time I have to add bell pepper, onion, ham and feta cheese to his. That’s his request.

I used a bit of smoked olive oil and used Fresh shredded Romano instead of Parmesan. That sprinkle of nutmeg was a nice addition. Next time I’d serve sliced tomatoes with it or grape tomatoes if off-season

I added an egg, omitted the nutmeg and I used one slice of pepperjack cheese (crumbled). Very yummy. I also chopped the spinach beforehand.

I tried this recipe because it didn't have any milk in it.  I'm lactose intolerant and can only have some hard cheeses but no milk.  I made this and added some mushrooms and shredded parmesan.  I also used white ground pepper instead of black and it was very delicious.

This was a great BASIC recipe - I loved the fact that the spinach & cheese were spread throughout the eggs instead of just in the middle.  I was afraid to use the nutmeg and used only a sprinkling of the onion powder.

The nutmeg definitely gives it a peculiar, yet enjoyable, flavor.  Only thing I did different was cook it in olive oil and butter.  I think I'd like to try it again.

I made this recipe as is and I think is good. However I believe that the ratio of spinach is a bit off. You could easily add an additional egg or reduce the amount of spinach. I mention this because even though spinach shrinks while cooking, I noticed that it was still a bit too much for the amount of egg. I also used shopped yellow onions about 2 tbsps. instead of the onion powder. I sautéed the onions before adding the egg mixture. It was great.

Made a variation of this. Instead of parmesan, I used mozzarella . For the eggs, I used egg whites, since it is healthier and reduces the amount of fat in the eggs. I loved this recipe and definitely recommend.

I used sharp cheddar instead of parm, because that’s what we prefer. Also used about 1/4 cup of finely chopped onion instead of onion powder. It was yummy :)

Next time I will probably use 3 eggs instead of 2 because it was a lot of ingredients for only two eggs.

I was looking for something different to make for breakfast and I had all the ingredients. I made it exactly as written and thought it was ok. I would have preferred it made with sautéed onions (instead of powder) and spinach as a filling for the omelet and topped with cheese, instead of all mixed together. I used a little less nutmeg than called for and thought that amount was perfect.

I sauteed some mushrooms in butter and added them to the egg mixture. I also added a few dashes of chili pepper flakes. This was very good. I tend to disagree with the  reviewer who states that the amount of nutmeg is 'overkill'. How would she know it is too much when she totally omitted the nutmeg?  The recipe should be rated as written not rated on an assumption. The amount of nutmeg is perfect. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was good. Unlike some reviewers, I did not find the spices overpowering. I served with cocktail tomatoes on the side. I didn't measure a cup for the spinach--just threw in as much as I wanted (a lot!).

This was really good. I cut the Parmesan in half but regretting it after making it because I couldn't really taste it so next time I'm definitely sticking to the full amount. I wasn't too crazy about the nutmeg, didn't feel like it did anything good to the spinach, so leaving it out next time. I also added 2 tbsp of whole milk because I like my omelettes light and fluffy. I fried the omelette in a small amount of butter because I don't think cooking spray is healthy (chemicals). Other than that this omelette came out amazing! Definitely making my spinach omelette this way from now on.

My husband and son thought this had a good flavor but had a dry aftertaste.  My husband suggests adding american cheese.  My son suggests a little less spinach.  I did saute the spinach a little before I added it to the egg mixture.  I personally loved it!

Made this this morning, it was really good! I cooked it with .5 tbsp of butter instead of  cooking spray.

Also halved the onion powder and put 1/8 tsp garlic powder. I think this would be even better with feta instead of parmesan!

Will make it again.  Am not a big fan of omelets, but loved this one.  Did not have nutmeg nor onion powder, so added a pinch of garlic powder, and about an ounce of feta cheese.

I sauteed garlic and red onions in butter and added them to the mixture before cooking the omelet. Then, just before plating, I added sliced avocado and halved grape tomatoes. Divine!

Added ham bits, black olives, onion instead of onion powder, and Roma tomato. Just a dash of nutmeg.  Saved some of Parmesan for top. Topped with salsa.

so yummy! ended up only using a half cup of spinach, 3 eggs, and used garlic salt and mozzarella cheese in place of the onion powder and parmesan cheese and stuffed the inside with mozzarella cheese. i was a little skeptical of the nutmeg but actually made it taste so good! next time ill have to try it with just egg whites instead of full eggs and see if it tastes just as good!

I've made this twice already in the past week! So delicious, filling and easy to throw together. I usually only use one egg for an omelet, so I halve the recipe, and it turned out just great. I sprinkled the parmesan on after it was plated, not into the mixture. Thanks for a keeper of a recipe, HOLLYJUNE!

Only change was to add chopped portobella mushrooms.  I do think that freshly grated nutmeg and parmesean are important to really optimize.  One of the best recipes I have found on this site (and I use this site a LOT!).  Thank you for sharing!

Mmmmm good, I just finished eating this. I had some minced onion to use up in my fridge so I sauteed a couple tablespoons in butter and then threw in and just wilted a couple handfuls of baby spinach. I dashed the nutmeg into my egg mix and poured that over the spinach mixture in the pan. Covered with lid and cooked until done. I loved the subtle nutmeg flavor in this omelette, I also topped with some great fresh tomato slices. Perfect breakfast.

Quite tasty and simple to do.  I will do again, but will play with the ingredients somewhat - first thing I will try is using real onions.

Wow! that was the easiest omelet I ever made. Used garlic powder instead of onion, no nutmeg since I don't have any, added a tsp of milk, more cheese and tomatoes. It was great! Will definitely use it again.

It was pretty good. I didn't really follow the recipe; I took the advice of other cooks. I omitted the nutmeg. I didn't have any fresh onion so I used frozen seasoning blend (red & green bell pepper, onion, a  little celery) instead. I sautéed the veggies & wilted the spinach. I added marble jack cheese to my eggs (as we didn't have any parmesan), & then poured the eggs into my veggie mixture. My omelet-making skills aren't the best, so my omelet was pretty ugly, but it tasted pretty good to be so good for me. I'll have to try this one again! :)

This was an excellent omelet for one trying to limit meat in their diet.  I sauteed some onion while wilting the spinach then added one beaten egg combined with one eggwhite.  Else I made it as directed. The nutmeg was a great touch.  Since I was making it the night before I did not use tomato as some of the other reviewers suggested, but served the omelet with tomato on the side.  Delicious! Eggs are the perfect food! Thanks for this recipe.

This is a very good quick and yummy recipe that can be personalized to one's own taste.  I omitted nutmeg and onion and instead added minced garlic and lemon pepper.  I also used cheddar cheese instead of Parmesan.  Next time I think that I will add in green pepper and sauteed onions.  Thanks for this recipe!

I was out of nutmeg, so I substituted pumpkin pie spice (nutmeg/clove/ginger/cinnamon) and it was delicious.  Subtle enough that if I hadn't made it, I'd be wondering what that mystery ingredient that makes the dish "pop" was!

A filling breakfast or lunch with the healthy addition of spinach. I used 1 egg and 2 egg whites. Next time, I will tear the spinach smaller and make sure it is loosely packed in the measuring cup. This is a great base recipe to which could be added mushrooms, peppers, and onions.

Really good - I made as directed except I used only 1 T of Parmesan. I didn't like the nutmeg, though. Next time I'll take that out and do the full amount of cheese. Also - I did the math and I think the nutrition information is too low. Enjoy!!

I didn't have fresh baby spinach so I cooked some frozen spinach to add to the egg mixture. I used 1 egg and 2 egg whites and I cooked the omelet in a little bit of real butter instead of cooking spray. Amazing! I can't wait to make for my son.

This is a great way to sneak some healthy foods and bring a wonderful mixture of green and yellow to the breakfast table.  I really didn't taste the spinach and it was not really crunchy - had more of a mild spicy flavor with a hint of cheese.

Yum!  I could eat this every morning.  Definitely add the nutmeg - it adds a very interesting flavor.  I didn't have parmesan so I used cheddar.

I love this omelet! It's a good quick omelette in the morning. It keeps me full for the first few classes. Sometimes I forget the onion powder and it still tastes perfect.

Good... perhaps use as base?  Perhaps use some Ementhal cheese to kick it up.

Wow this is by far the most delicious omelet I've ever had. It's super simple, and the ingredients are ones I always have on hand. The nutmeg adds the perfect something extra kind of flavor to it that really brings out the best of the eggs and spinach.

Used a mix of shredded cheddar/jack cheese instead, and it went just fine!  This was awesome.  Also, just did a scramble instead of even attempting the omelet.

As other people suggested, I used four egg whites to cut down on fat & cholesterol, and I threw in pre-chopped garlic that you buy in a jar (I'm busy! Haha.) and a bit of seasoning salt. Delicious and healthy way to start my day, and to be honest, I've made this for lunch and dinner, too, when I've been swamped with work!

This was excellent as is.  But we like a little more spice around our house, so when I made the second one, I subbed fresh green onion for the onion powder.  Also added a dash of fines herbs and topped with some provolone cheese.  Delish!!

I was looking for an easy dinner and had all these ingredients on hand. I used 2 egg whites to replace one of the eggs and thawed some frozen spinach. Anyway it's really good! I'll totally make this again :)

My 17 year old son found the recipe (he loves to cook but REALLY loves to eat) and made it for himself...he loved it so much he made another 10 minutes later...this is a keeper, easy enough for a teen to throw together and quick to boot.

This omelet is DELICIOUS!!  I've made it with real eggs and with egg substitute.  The real eggs were a little fluffier, but the taste was the same.  And as skeptical as I was of the nutmeg....I've made it two days in a row now! YUMMY!!!

This was so good!  I didn't have onion powder so i used the flesh/juice from a green onion.  Very tasty!  Would have taken a picture, but the smell was so good I gobbled it up quickly...

Just made this for breakfast and I loved it. Added a bit more cheese (shredded, not grated). Came together quickly and was very tasty, not to mention pretty as well.

Wonderfully quick and flavorful.  I doubled the recipe (kept the nutmeg at 1/8t though).  I haven't mastered flipping an omelet yet, so this turned out more like flattened scrambled eggs...but neither of us complained!
