So easy and delicious.  We live down here in south Texas on the border and I use Mexican vanilla in all of my baked dishes.  Mexican vanilla has a slight spiciness to it (which is why I believe this recipe calls for cinnamon - Mexican vanilla almost has a cinnamon-y taste to it).  That being said, I used Mexican vanilla instead of regular and it was perfect.  I do not remove mine from the pan but poke holes in the top and pour on the milk liberally - it always leaves a bit of milk in the bottom of the pan as each piece is removed.  This is how we like it down here :)  Can't beat this easy recipe!  P.S.  After chilling overnight we topped it with real whipped cream and garnished with chocolate curls.

I love this recipe. I did cut the milk amounts in half because we don't like a soggy cake and I added 1/2 teaspoon coconut extract to the milks. I also use Betty Crocker Chocolate fudge cake mix and Dutch cocoa. I have a friend who orders this cake often and her and her family just love it.

This recipe was delicious!. I am an Hispanic person and in my country we used to eat tres leches cake. I wanted to make this kind of cake for a friend of mine for her birthday and I knew that she love chocolate. when I found this recipe I made it without thinking much. She loved it a lot! and her family too. My husband and I don't care much of chocolate but this cake was very good that I can make it again :) . But i didn't use cinnamon because we don't use that ingredient for tres leches cake in my country and I don't think it goes well with that cake.

I made this for a party and it was surprisingly good. I wasn't really sure about the cinnamon, and I'm still not convinced that I liked the cinnamon in it, but my friends said that they thought it added a unique flavor that made it great, so I'll take their word on it. However, next time I'll try it without the cinnamon just to see how I like it.

Very delicious room temp or cold. Made for a church small group and everyone loved. Oh the only change I had to make, I had no evaporate milk so used the only other milk I had, 2%. Will have to try again some time with the evap milk.

This came out looking nothing like the picture (my husband joked I should call it "Ugly Cake"), but it was delicious. I do wish it looked a bit prettier since we do eat with our eyes first... but it was really a tasty cake. Great for potlucks or (nearly) last minute needs.
