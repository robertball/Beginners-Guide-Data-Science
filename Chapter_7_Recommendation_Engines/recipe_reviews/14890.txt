Made this for hubby and after adding an some sour mix it was great! 1 ounce = 2 tablespoons so: 1/4 cup whiskey to 1/4 sour mix. We used calorie free sugar free sour mix (Baja Bob's) and it came out very good. We will definitely make this again. Like in a few minutes.

I'm new here. I bought Holland House Whiskey Sour Mix and this recipe beats it all together. Love the way it goes together. I will try all as soon as I can.

Super easy to make at home for pennies they charge big bucks at bars and restaurants for these. Can also use this recipe and sub Amaretto. Hubby loves these!

This was a staple in our house in the late '60s. Very easy. We use Daily's Sweet & Sour Mix. And very important use a shaker and ice when mixing the ingredients.

I've used this recipe for 30 years and my whole family looks at this as our "vacation drink".

I'd hardly call this a recipe... premixed sour and whiskey. Is the family recipe for stroganoff a box of Hamburger Helper? Kidding aside if you're in a hurry and just want to pour something it'll get the job done.

Used Fresca instead of sour mix it tastes much less processed.
