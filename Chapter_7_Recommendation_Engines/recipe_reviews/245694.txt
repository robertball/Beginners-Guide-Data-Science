This was great, my kids loved it too! A few tips: I drizzled a little oil into the panko crumbs along with the salt and mixed it through, for a nice golden brown finish. Also instead of flipping I put a rack on the very bottem and the very top of my oven and just switched it halfway through. Worked like a charm! And as someone else said I needed extra panko crumbs too.

The recipe came out well. I was surprised how well it went because the recipe asked for it to be baked. I think tempura at Japanese restaurants tend to be fried. Excuse me if that's incorrect.

The recipe I made can feed a total of 27 pieces divided by 9 for each batch.

Would recommend to those who crave Japanese tempura. It is also a vegetarian dish so it's good for vegetarians.

My veggies (onion, broccoli, potatoes and cauliflower) started getting burned on the outside in 5 minutes so I turned down the temperature gradually to 400F, and total cooking ended up being about 30 mins. I also sprinkled veggies with oil half way through baking. The dish turned out to be a bit too dry to my liking, and took too long to bread every piece of veggie.

Didn't work at all. Despite the pan being well-greased, the tempura batter stuck to the baking sheets. It turned out pretty gross.

I left the sweet potatoes out because we do not like them but other than that I made as written. These take some time to prep so plan ahead. I'll admit that I wish I would have dropped them in the deep fryer to get a more overall even brown but then that would have defeated the purpose of them being more healthy. The onions brown up the fastest so keep a close eye on them. The one problem I did find with this recipe is that you are going to need a lot more Panko than the recipe calls for so plan for that too. Overall I was happy with the way they turned out but to be honest,  I will drop them in the deep fryer instead of baking the next time I make this.
