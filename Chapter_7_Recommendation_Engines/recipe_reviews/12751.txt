I used frozen imitation crabmeat and Kraft fat-free mayo.  I also add the stems to the mix.  These are delicious!  I love stuffed mushrooms so any time I can try them a different way I am up for it.  Suggestion:  Bake leftover mix and serve with crackers.  Very delish!

These were very tasty and very easy! I made these with Portobello mushrooms and served them as an entree. I added some red bell pepper. I didn't have any savory so I didn't include that but I did add a pinch of lemon pepper. I will make just the stuffing again and serve it by itself as a salad or on slices of French bread.

Made these for New Year's Eve... They were GREAT!  Best (and easiest) stuffed mushrooms I've made. I didn't have savory, so I substituted garlic (garlic goes with everything!) and I added a 1/2 c. shredded cheddar as another reviewer said. I'm excited to make these again, for the Super Bowl!

I love mushrooms but was a little dissappointed with these. Also they definitely have to be served right away b/c they are better hot.

THE BEST!!  I did not have savory so I just used a bit more thyme and I also added garlic - this was a hit!!  My hubby asks for these all the time.  I just made a big batch of the stuffing, used what I needed at the time and froze the rest in seperate portions.  When ever I wanted more, pop out the freezer and there you go!

Loved them!  Made them for a shower after a trial one with another recipie from this site.  THis one won hands down.  
I added about a third cup of the chopped stems.  I also used a parmesean/romano blend.  THey were perfectly spiced.
To solve the waterety problem, I put the mushrooms on paper towels before putting them on a serving platter.
Overall- delicious!

Very good and easy to make recipe.  I substitued the mayonaise with Ranch dressing, but in the future would actually substitute them both for some melted butter.  Also, we topped some with shredded Parmesean cheese and some others with Swiss Cheese and we preferred the Swiss Cheese topped ones better.  But it was an excellent base recipe and overall we were completely happy with it!!!

My boyfriend and I thought that these mushrooms were better than any we've had out at restaurants.  I added about 1/2 cup of grated sharp cheddar cheese to the filling, and before baking, I put a little of the grated cheese on top of the mushrooms.  The cheese seemed to give them an extra kick of flavor.

I love this recipe!  My dad had his own recipe for many years but when he had these he asked me to send it to him so he could make them for his company party.  The only change that Iâ€™ve made is to omit the green onions.  I serve them on a platter of romaine lettuce leaves with small wedges of lemon.  The best!!

Delicious!  I tried making these with cream cheese and mayo.  Mayo wins, hands down.  Use some sharp cheddar cheese and garlic salt to add more flavor.  I also used the small muffin pans for each mushroom - it keeps them separated and eay to fill.  With the amount of filling, I always seem to fill 24 mushrooms so aim for that instead of a pound of mushrooms.

I made this recipe based on other reviews and what I had on hand. First I didn't have savory or green onion so I used garlic and I used imitation crabmeat.  I also accidentally added the parmasean cheese to the mix and also added queso fresco. Then I stuffed portabello mushrooms with fresh spinach, the crab  mix and then put sliced mozzarella and drizzled  olive oil on top. It came out so delicious and rich. Next time I might use tomatoes in the mix and make  it with small mushrooms for appetizers at my next  party.

I used this recipe as a base and had six very large portobello mushrooms. I removed the stems and chopped them up along with a yellow bell pepper and four cloves of garlic. I had 6 slices of (thin) pre-cooked bacon that I zapped in the micro for a minute till crispy and then sauteed the vegetables together. Added in 8 ounces of crab, 1/2 cup of parmesan/romano cheese, 1/3 cup mayo (oilve oil based), 4-5 green onions and put in a full teaspoon of thyme, oregano and a half of savory. Got about a half cup of filling for each shroom and baked for 15 minutes at 375 (20 minutes would have been better). 

Nutritional content? Each one is 173 calories, 9.3 g fat (2.1 sat), 53.7 cholesterol, 406.5 sodium, 6.8 g carb (1.7 g fiber), 13.8 g protein. 

The bacon I use is the pre-cooked stuff from Sam's (it's the one of two things I get at that store. Each slice is 17.5 calories, but it's really thin). Enjoy!

I made a batch of 40 of these mushrooms for a party and they were gone in 15 minutes, maybe less. They were a HUGE hit. Everyone loved them and wanted the recipe. I follwed the recipe exactly. I will be using this time and time again... starting again with this weekend. Thanks for a great recipe!

These were very good. Instead of 7 oz of crab, I went to a fish market and bought 10 oz of fresh crab meat. That cured any "too wet" problem others were concerned about. I also cooked them five minutes longer, adding some shredded cheese to the top for those last few minutes. Very nice.

I made these for my dad's 60th birthday party and someone asked which restaurant they came from!  These are great and easy!  I live in Seattle, so I was able to get some great fresh crab meat from Pike Place Market.  The only change I made was to use about 9-10 oz of crab meat because I wanted more crab flavor than anything else.  My brother-in-law was eating the filling out of the bowl!  Will definitely be making this again.

Sorry, I was really disappointed in this one. Mushrooms were still raw and filling had no taste.

This was my first time ever making crab stuffed mushroom and it turned out so good!  I could only find 6 oz. cans of crab, so I ended up using two of those and it was just enough for the amount of mushrooms I had.  I had two 10 oz. pkgs. of gourmet stuffing mushrooms.  I ended up baking them for about 20 min. and then I broiled them for about 3 min. to brown the tops a little.   Everybody loved them!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

I'm sorry, I think these sound so good and I LOVE crab stuffed mushrooms....however, these turned out terrible.  I made them as written and there was no taste...I even tried adding ingredients after and it was still lifeless.  I will not be making this recipe again.

This recipe is perfect as it is.   It's no harder than mixing up tuna for a sandwich.   I have served these many times - always with rave reviews.     It's also pretty adaptable as far as oven temperature goes - if you've got something else roasting/baking.   I've also used this unbaked as a spread for crackers or filling for celery sticks.    Two notes:  I always use fresh dungeness crab meat and "real" parmesan (imported parmesan reggiano).  The quality of the ingredients makes all the difference in the world.

I made these for my birthday party this past weekend. They were an absolute hit. I did not have savory and did not substitute it, but did use fresh herbs instead of dried, the taste was amazing. My friends have discriminating taste and I knew they would be great judges, they loved it.  Easy to make and I will be doing these again!

Delicious! I left out the savory because I did not have any. I doubled the recipe and used 1 package each of imitation crab and imitation lobster (its what I had).
*Update* I wanted to make this again, but I wanted to incorporate the filling into a more substantiating meal. I made the filling and chopped up the mushrooms to add to it and I added the paprika to the mix. I rolled it all into a puff pastry sheet and baked it, and it was amazing!

These are tasty and a nice appetiser for a crowd.  Next time I will use fresh lump crab not canned crab.  I think that would improve the texture.

this was a wonderful appetizer for our Father's Day Dinner. I must caution you though to make sure you rinse and drain the crab really well, if not you get a soggy stuffing. Thank goodness we gave this a "trial run" before we served this to guests! Draining the crab thoroughly made all the difference. I will be using this again!

Savory is a spice that is difficult to find, use a blend of dry thyme and dry sage (ground fine) 2/3 thyme and 1/3 sage blened well. This is what my mother used for savory. There is a group of spices known as savory and two of the best know are summer and winter. Just use the thyme and sage blend and you will enjoy the flavor of this recipe. Leave the 1/4 teaspoon of tyme out of the recipe as the tyme in the savory will be enough for the recipe.

This recipe is ok as a starting-off point, but left alone I didn't care for it at all. I added fresh italian parsley, lemon pepper, a little cayenne pepper, fresh lemon juice (about 1/2 a lemon), sharp cheddar and mozzarella cheeses, onion salt, and a little cream to the crab mixture. It definitely tasted a lot better after I doctored it up. I think next time I will just go with a cream cheese and crab mixture, because I believe it would taste better. Lesson learned! If you were to add just one ingredient to the original recipe list, it should be some fresh lemon juice to brighten it up a little bit.

This mushrooms were sooooo yummy. The best crab stuffed mushrooms i have ever tasted so far. I made to baking dishes of them and all i got out of them were 5 mushrooms. All the others my fiance was shuffling down as crazy. He agreed that these were the best crab stuffed mushrooms he ever had. Thanks so much for the recipe. And to all the others that are reading the reviews this is an absolutely keeper and so easy to make.

Everyone loved these at our Christmas party. I normally make stuffed mushrooms filled with cream cheese filling but thought this would be a nice change. I think I like these better and we will definitely be having them again. Due to the size of my mushrooms, I found I had to bake them longer than 15 minutes. Think I added another 5-10 minutes to get the right tenderness.

These were so good.  I brought them to a family dinner for an appetizer, even the kids who didn't like crab or onions - devoured them!  :D  The combination just has such great flavor..

I make htese for my wife who loves stuffed mushrooms. They are quite easy to make. The key is the green onions. They seem to add a flavor that makes these complete. I sometimes add bread crumbs to the mix if it seems to wet. Easy to overdo it with the mayo.

This dish was deliciou and surprisingly easy to make, and it was a big hit at my New Year's party. Just be careful when scooping out the mushrooms-- they can be delicate and some of mine fell apart!

Best recipe for stuffed mushrooms I've found!! My 5 year old daughter and I had a great time making them together and they were delicious!!! Wish we would've made more because they were gone in 15 minutes!! We did tweet the recipe just a little. We chopped the mushroom stems and added them to the filling. We also added cream cheese. Soooooo good!!! We are making them again tomorrow :)

I'd give this 3.5 stars if i could ... it was certainly good, but with some doctoring it could be terrific.  I made these almost exactly as written (my parmesan on top was a little scant, and I forgot the paprika).  Overall, I thought they ware good, but they were slightly undercooked (and my mushrooms were pretty small!), they were a little watery, and the onions were a tad too prominent.  When I make them again -- and I will! -- I'll add some lemon juice, cut back on the onion a bit, and possibly add some bread crumbs or crushed bread stuffing to absorb some of the moisture.  I'd also be really interested to try subbing cream cheese instead of the mayo.  All that said, these are fairly tasty, easy, fast, and taste more caloric and indulgent than they are.

These came out great but made some slight modifications. I needed a lot of stuffing and like less mayo so I doubled the amount of crab and used about 1/4 of mayo. Did not have savory so I used garlic powder as some suggested. I also added about 1/4 cup of breadcrumb (probably will add more of this next time) as well as half of squeezed fresh lemon. Before baking I topped it with the parmesan and paprika but also added breadcrumb to give it a bit of crunch at the end. Came out delicious.

This was my first attempt at stuffed mushrooms and it came out amazing! I omitted the green onions and substituted garlic powder for the savory.  I also added a sprinkle of lemon pepper, a little less then 1/4  cup of grated sharp cheddar cheese to the mix, brushed them with melted butter, and added both parm and cheddar to the top before popping them in the oven.  I sprung for the more expensive fresh backfin crab meat too.  Everyone raved about them all night!!! Def recommend if you're into delicious food!

I have never been able to order crab stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer in a restaurant because they always bring to much for one person and my wife has never liked any that she has tasted until I made these, Now, she prepares them for us at home and loves them.

this recipe was great, but i changed a lot of it. i make stuffed mushrooms alot. instead of mayo I used cream cheese. I also sauteed the mushroom stems in olive oil and lots of garlic. Then I added all the other ingredients as written. I brought these to a party this weekend, they were the first dish gone, and everyone wanted more! There is no way to mess these up!

These were a hit at my New Years party.  You need to eat them quickly after they come out of the oven.  Unfortunately they become cold quickly.  It looks like you spend a lot of time on them.

Very good....I found this recipe after my friend served imitation crabmeat-stuffed mushrooms at a party, and these are worlds better.  The stem, gill, and base removal process is quite lengthy, but some grocery stores sell mushroom caps ready for stuffing, and those make this recipe super-easy.  Definitely making again for guests!

My girlfriend said this was the absolute best she had ever tasted. I thought that these mushrooms were better than any I've had out at any restaurant. They take a little time to prepare, but are definitely worth it!  I'll make them again and again. I would HIGHLY recommended this recipe.

I don't even like mushrooms, but I made this for my roommates and they both loved it!  I thought that cleaning out all the mushroom gills was just about impossible (although it was my first time - so maybe it was just me), but other than that the recipe was really easy.  I would definitely make this for a dinner party appetizer.

These were ok.  I used portebello mushrooms.  I think this would be good as a cold dip for crackers.  I would however use 1/4 cup of each: mayo and FRESH parmesan rather than 1/3 cup as I find it masked a bit of the crab taste.  The green onions add a nice taste to it.  I will be making this as a cold dip, but not as a mushroom stuffing.

WAY too much onion and mayo.  Also needs longer cooking time as we were eating near raw mushrooms

I did not have green onion, so used onion powder instead. also added bread crumbs to this recipe. Also after stuffing mushrooms I added some panko bread crumbs on top for a nice crisp coating

I had to bake them for over 35 minutes. The stuffing was still only lukewarm, but the mushrooms were cooked. It's probably not a good idea to refridgerate the stuffing for a long period of time. As far as taste is concerned, it was alittle bland.

Delicious!!!  I made these as the appetizer for my anniversary dinner and we both loved them!  Will definitely make again.  Something so easy shouldn't taste so good.  They were even better when the longer I refrigerated the filling.  After I stuffed the mushrooms, then refrigerated them until dinner.  Fabulous!  Highly recommended.

I tried this recipe but  I added minced onion, minced green peppers and garlic.    If you don't want soggy mushrooms - bake the mushrooms cap side down on a baking sheet for 15 minutes in a 300 degree oven   Remove from cookie sheet and place on a paper towel.   Let them drain.   Then  when most the water has drained, fill them with the stuffing and proceed with the recipe.   Soggy stuffed mushrooms aren't very appetizing.

I've made this twice. The first time it seemed to be missing something but was close to being what I wanted. 

I added 2 cloves of garlic, 1 teaspoon paprika, 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil and 3 tablespoons of cream cheese. Baked 350 until mushrooms are nicely done, about 25min. I found this to be much more flavourful.

I used Phillips Lump Crab and organic mushrooms.  It needs something to give it some zing.  Maybe a bit of sirachha or tabasco sauce.  If I wasn't gluten intolerant, I would have added some italian bread crumbs for some crunch.   I would use it as a start of a good recipe and add additional ingredients.

I wound up mixing the parmesan and the paprika in with the stuffing, and then sprinkled some extra paprika on top. I also substituted sage instead of savory and only used 1/4 yellow onion since I didn't have any green onions and we try not to use too much onion anymore and they turned out AMAZING! I will definitely make this again, the same way I made them tonight! Big hit!

I made this recipe with baby bella mushrooms, which I think may have required more cooking time than this recipe suggested.  I also think I should've added breadcrumbs either in the stuffing or as a topping. Maybe some time under the broiler would've been good?  They were  good but not quite the taste I was looking for.

I could not find savory at my grocery store (Publix) I substituted tarragon, based on my spice chart. the cooked mushrooms were bland and definitely missing something. I lied the fact that this recipe included crab and was "diet friendly". However, with the expense of crab meat & lack of flavor, I would not do again.

A big disappointment! Maybe it needed more mayo, or SOMETHING but it just didn't have any flavor! I added garlic powder, and I used Asiago cheese instead of Parmesan. Maybe it needed to be refrigerated for a longer time to let the flavors meld, or maybe it needed to be in the oven longer... this one has stumped me.

Wasn't bad, but the parmesan cheese alone made it hard to chew and sort of bland. I'm going to replace the mayo with cream cheese next time and add in a soft cheese.

I really liked this recipe, the only things I changed were to omit the green onions and add the stems to the mixture...next time I will add some salt as well.  Overall a really good, easy recipe that I will definitely use again.  I will add that the nutrition data is off on this recipe, way less calories than 167 per serving.

I actually made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving.  It was such a hit!  Even my over-judgemental mother-in-law loved them.

Perhaps it's just because I'm a terrible cook, or maybe it was my substitutions, but unfortunately these came out terrible for me. I hate wasting food, so please don't make the same mistake I did! I used Miracle Whip instead of the mayo, and I substituted rosemary since I didn't have any savory. I hope you have more success following the recipe exactly! I'm sure that it would have turned out better.

I made this as an appetizet for the superbowl party it was a hit.  I used the smaller sized mushrooms and the turned out great. I added some garlic and used montery jack cheese for the topping instead of the parmsean.

This was very easy to put together which I did ahead of time prior to baking at the end. The only thing I had to change was the amount of crab meat, as I could only find 6 ounce cans of the meat so I just used 2 cans verses the one and the rest worked out just fine! They were a BIG hit and I really liked them a lot. Thank you for sharing.

I prepared this dish for my family and friends for our Christmas Eve family tradition of snack foods, drink and fun.  It was a huge hit.  I was asked several times for the recipe.  This will become a regular dish for my family.

This is one of the best stuffed mushroom recipes I've ever tried.  I altered it slightly by adding more paprika as well as dried chopped onion and it was wonderful.  With all the other stuffed mushroom recipes I have used before with crab, this is the only one I could find where you could still distinctly taste the crab after it was baked.

Made this recipe as part of a Mother's Day meal.  My whole family loved it and my dad requested it as part of his father's day meal.  Weeks later he has just reminded me that I have to make it for father's day.  I added fresh garlic but otherwise kept the recipe as is.  Delicious!

This was so easy..SO delicious!  It was very similar to a dish I had in a restaurant.  I left out the savory and thyme (didn't have either one) but I added minced garlic, and when I put all of them in the pan, I sprayed the tops with spray butter.  Absolutely great recipe!  My husband and kids didn't try them, but I didn't mind...I made them for a Superbowl get-together and my friend and I loved them!

I didn't like this recipe.  Too strong a flavor of savory, that didn't compliment the crabmeat.  I love mushrooms and crabmeat, but the tastes in this recipe did not blend together well at all.

Not very flavorful.  I used fresh shredded parmesan instead of grated, and it made the top too crunchy.  Needs to be eaten very quickly after you take them out of the oven.

I love this recipe! Everytime I have a party, someone requests it. Even people who think they don't like seafood or mushrooms like this recipe!

Will definently make again.  Rather than using small mushrooms, I used the large caps approximately 5 inches across.  I used claw crab meat rather than imitation, makes a world of difference.  Was served as the main course.  When using the large caps be sure to choose ones that are very thick.  Otherwise they lose body.  The thick ones cut like a steak with a crab stuffing topping.  We did not use any of the bread crumbs.  We aim for a very low carb diet.

so easy to make- I used shrimp instead of the crabmeat (needed that for the crab dip I'm also making!) I also added shredded mozzarella cheese to the filling, then sprinkled on top at the last 8 or 9 minutes. Can't wait to make these again!

Cut a VERY THIN  FLAT LAYER of the top off the mushroom, then they don't roll around while you're stuffing and cooking. I made them in the air fryer, 360 for 9 minutes. I used baby bellas. I added sweet peppers and a little Worcestershire sauce, and skipped the savory because I don't have it. Next time I would use provolone or mozzarella to top with rather than the parmesan. Very good with some slight changes.

Very disappointed in how these tasted (average at best and weird spices for crab) and there wasn't enough creamy texture. I also agree with others that more cooking time is needed, because the mushrooms were raw.

We did not like these at all.  Something about the flavor....it was missing something and we felt the oregano taste was strong.  Would have been better made with cream cheese and breadcrumbs as others have said,

I really feel bad leaving a bad review in general, but in my opinion these are absolutely terrible. I am a home cooked meal - meat and potato kind of girl cooking with butter, all the seasonings, cheese, cream, etc. Typically I make stuffed mushrooms that are cream cheese-based versus mayo. I just canâ€™t wrap my head around why the reviews are so great here. Iâ€™ll stick with my recipes.

Excellent base recipe. I added a bit of powdered mustard to make the stuffing more deviled. I topped each filled mushroom with a small square of mozzarella and sprinkled shaved Parmesan on top. They browned beautiful fully and tasted fantastic!  Will make again!

I used grated parm and topped with shaved parm. I also used garlic, yellow onion, garlic and a dash of cumin and cayenne pepper. Would have been better with green onion. Will definitely make it again.

They got gobbled up at a Christmas party yesterday.  Several people wanted the recipe.  Sorry,  no pics.  Could not find the "savory" seasoning at Whole Foods.  I added a little bit or Bosari instead.

I make these regularly, and they are delicious.   When I didn't have savory, I substituted sage, and they turned out fine.  Also once I didn't have green onions, so I substituted a smaller amount of red onion.   Everyone who has tried them LOVES them, and they never stay on the plate for long!

Very tasty! Not a lot of work either! I used 4 jumbo white mushrooms, so the cooking time was 25 - 30 minutes.  I used 1 can of canned crabmeat. Also, instead of the individual spices i just used the Costco brand Italian seasoning.  Due to their size I served these to be eaten with a knife and fork - which seemed to make eating this yummy appetizer even more enjoyable!

These are fantastic as a main dish. Just add a Caesar or other side salad. I couldn't get savory, so I subbed Old Bay Seasoning. I will definitely make this yummy recipe again!

4.5/5 these guys are the perfect appetizer. So quick and easy too! I take the poor mans approach and use artificial crab and baby prawns instead. I also will sautee some shrimp in butter with garlic salt and pepper to pop on top when they are done! 
Very popular and gluten free too! Thanks!

Was very disappointed; I followed recipe exactly except that I didn't have any scallions, so I omitted.  I did use PINK crab from a can, which I never tried before.  Mushrooms did not seem very tender and the filling was just mediocre.  Maybe expectations were just too high, but I really did not like them.

I very much liked these, unfortunately my husband refused to try it because he hates crab so I don't have a second opinion. I agree with others that there isn't a strong crab taste (so know that ahead of time) but I did use canned crab. I added red bell pepper, a little lemon pepper, the stems, and paprika into the filling. I will definitely make again with a better quality crab.

They were dry and tasted odd.  There are much better crab-stuffed mushroom recipes out there.  I should have read the reviews, instead of simply relying on the star rating.

Fantastic, so delicious! Like some other reviewers, I also used garlic instead of savoury, included some extra grated old white cheddar in the mix instead of the extra parmesan (still sprinkled parmesan on the tops, of course) and I did, in fact, grease the baking dish with some butter. Also used fresh-packed immitation crabmeat. They were easy to make came out beautifully, and so yummy. A big hit with me and my guests. I will certainly be making these again, both when entertaining and for my own personal dinner. I also reheated the leftover filling the next day to make a wrap with some fresh spinach for my lunch and it was excellent.

These sounded so easy and the recipe itself appealed to all of my Christmas guests. I made the recipe as written and was disappointed. We didn't eat half of them. Maybe next time I want to make a recipe like this, I will try using fresh crab meat (certainly more work) and add some panko. Sorry, these just weren't good.

I made this  for Thanksgiving this year. Very easy recipe. My mushrooms created a watery soup underneath. I was told to back the mushrooms for3-5 minutes to dry them out before stuffing them. I'll try this next time. They came out pretty bitter. It may have been the parm. cheese I chose. Next time I want to add a sweeter cheese like swiss with the parm.

These were awesome!  I used light mayo, less onion, extra savory. They got rave reviews from my guests.  I used lump crab.  The filling would make a great cold crab salad.

These weren't quite what we were looking for...they were ok, but my husband felt they needed a breading of some sort. Still searching for the "PERFECT" recipe.

I used stuffing mushrooms and not button mushrooms. After the 15 minutes was up, I felt that my mushrooms were not quite done and that they needed something to hold the mixture together.  So, I put a quarter slice of provolone on the top and put them back into the oven.  Although I had problems (which may be related to the size of my mushrooms);the flavor was good.

We used imitation crab and that was too sugary for me. Also didn't like the mayo. husband liked them but think i will try this once more using cream cheese instead of mayo and fresh crab meat.

This was okay, though my husband liked it better than I did.  The flavor was pretty bland, and they needed longer than 15 minutes to cook.

This recipe was a hit at Thanksgiving!  Everyone couldn't get over how flavorful it was.  Then I made them again for a Christmas Party and the people I made them for used the leftovers in their eggwhite omletes.  Sounds crazy but it was delicious. Thank you!!!!

I didn't use all the spices listed and I did add some Tastefully Simple Bacon Bacon seaonsoning.  The moisture of the stuffing was perfect. Not too dry and not runny at all.  These were the best stuffed mushrooms I have made.

These mushrooms are pretty easy to make - as discussed above, just a little time consuming to scoop out the stems to create the cups.  I did not really like them very much - just a little boring.  However, I made them for Xmas and everyone enjoyed them.

My boyfriend said this was the absolute best appetizer he had ever tasted. My only complaint is that it takes alot of time and is difficult to hollow out the mushrooms. But it is worth it and I will be making these again.

This recipe is so wonderful- all my guests loved it and I couldn't eat enough of them! Highly recommend- my fussy 2 year old wouldn't give it a chance, that's why my kid friendly rating is low- I'll bet he'll love it later on in life!

Easy to make for a novice (like me), but they were not as tasty as I expected.  Maybe would be better with a different cheese substituted for the parmesan.

I did not care for this recipe. I drained the crab really well and only wiped the mushrooms with a damp cloth and it was still too watery. The filling did not have a very good flavor at all, we threw away most of them. I will not make this again.

I LOVE these mushrooms!  They take a little time to prepare, but are definitely worth it!  We do not celebrate an anniversary, New Year's, or any other special occasion in my house without these!  They are a huge hit.  I've made them again and again.
