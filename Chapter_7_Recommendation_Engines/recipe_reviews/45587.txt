HUGE hit.  Huge. Unequivocally the star of the show.  This dessert brought grown men to their knees.   Never mind dinner,  I could have served this and this alone and I think everyone would have been happy. Hubs had requested I make an ice cream dessert for our Memorial Day cook-out and I was less than enthusiastic. None of the recipes really tripped my trigger, but I finally settled on this one, I guess because it called for something homemade and not processed - the fudge.  Sure, you could take the easy way out and use a jarred fudge sauce but this was so easy to make it's not really worth it to take the shortcut.  I wasn't expecting much from this dessert. After all, it's basically just a hot fudge sundae, right?  WRONG.  This stuff is good - awesome good. Just a few cookie crumbs, some ice cream, fudge, peanuts and some whipped topping, but man, put them all together and you've got a dessert that everyone loved and that truly made a dinner get-together finale memorable.  None of us knew what a Buster Bar was, but all agreed this was "D good."  This was the first, but not nearly the last, time I'll be making this.  I followed the recipe exactly, but thought the dessert would look a little naked with just the Cool Whip topping (curious, too, that the Cool Whip didn't even offend me in this dessert!) so I sprinkled it with more Oreo cookie crumbs.  (One other bonus - the crust actually comes out of the pan intact!)

This is very tasty. My guests loved it! One tip, buy 1/2 gallon box of ice cream, open the package completely and simply slice the ice cream into 1 inch thick pieces and lay them over your crust.  No softening of the ice cream required! Which means you can spread your fudge sauce immediately! Makes the entire assembly process much faster. Enjoy!

Wow! This is absolutely amazing! I will tell you what I did with this recipe...I made the fudge sauce as directed and it was out of this world amazing! I made my own homemade vanilla ice cream instead of using store-bought. I then cut the rest of the recipe down to fit in a springform pan. The fudge sauce in the recipe alone is a keeper. Don't forget the spanish roasted peanuts! I found Planter's Roasted Spanish Peanuts w/Sea Salt at my local grocery store. I was also able to spread out each layer on top of another without having the freeze into between.

This was an excellent frozen dessert. Guests at my dessert buffet gobbled it down quickly. For their more complex palates, I used Starbucks Cappucino Ice cream rather than vanilla. I also had a dab of coconut and some toasted pecans that I placed in the food processor with the butter and chocolate cookie wafers. This addition added a nice texture to the crust. Thanks Michelle.

Review of item as written: Needed a make-ahead option for hosting a dinner in a location with limited facilities. This dessert is very durable for transport & of course, being frozen, keeps well. Made it twice now with good results both times. 

Divergences, suggestions: Make sauce first, allow to cool. Soften ice cream, layer on crust, press chopped nut layer in while soft. Put in freezer until hard-set, then spread fudge sauce over top & sprinkle with any additional nuts as desired. (This prevents layers blending/rising/etc.) Subbing sweetened condensed milk for the evap + sugar works & eliminates the boiling process. A brownie or cookie base is a nice alternative to the crumb crust. Additional chopped peanuts on top of the fudge layer are pretty. Other flavor combos to consider are caramel/cashew, butterscotch/pecan, chocolate/pretzel, marshmallow/walnut instead of fudge/peanut. Alternative ice cream flavors can also introduce variety. Good recipe as presented, tremendous capacity for variation as well.

This is like a pumped up version of a peanut buster parfait from DQ!  I made this for my son's 3rd birthday, and I am still getting requests for this recipe!

Just like Dairy Queen peanut buster parfait.  Now, that I know how to make the chocolate icing, will be switching it up to butterscotch and peanut butter flavour.  

And freezes very well and can last along time in the freezer - no need to rush through this dessert - can save some for next week.

While I haven't eaten this as a whole, I tasted each of the components and it's going to be amazing! (I made it for a dessert menu special at work and couldn't cut into it quite yet.) The fudge sauce is KILLER!! Paired with a tasty oreo crust and delicious vanilla bean ice cream, how could this not be an awesome treat?! I used dry roasted nuts since I didn't have Spanish nuts on hand, and I think it will work, though I know Spanish peanuts is more traditional for this Dairy Queen dessert replica. A great treat for a hot summer day! This fudge sauce is a keeper!

Five stars for ease and rave reviews from family and guests. Next time, I might add more chocolate chips to make the fudge sauce "fudgier." It wasn't as fudgey as I had  hoped it would be. Otherwise, it was very good and everyone really liked it.

This was wonderful!  The recipe is spot on for amounts, although I would have eaten more of the fudge sauce had I put it in there!  I agree with another reviewer-it's nice that the crust actually comes out of the pan.  My husband said, I really wish you wouldn't have made this-I'm going to eat it all!  This was a great treat and I will be making it many, many more times.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  (And adding to my waistline!)  ; )

WARNING! You'll want to make one of these just for you to consume all by yourself! The fudge part tastes EXACTLY like what you'll find at your local DQ, I could drink it!! Thanks so much!

I wanted to cut down the calories and size for the 2 of us; so used one ready-made Oreo crust and Hershey's fudge sauce and about half the amount of other ingredients. Easy and good! The ready made crust comes with a lid that you can invert and put on top which makes it so easy to store the dessert in the freezer or take to a dinner party!

A hit - complete with an awesome wow factor (despite my slight technical issue with serving the dessert ;) ) Very easy to prepare, and I followed the recipe completely. Also, I used Cool Whip and had no issues with taste or flavour what so ever. It behaved very well and complimented the dessert well. The peanuts work beautifully as well (sort of like a hidden surprise!!). Next time, for the fudge sauce, I'd like to sub the evaporated milk for condensed milk and adjust the sugar accordingly coz I'm not so fond of evaporated milk. Also, next time I want to be sure to 'completely' crush the oreo biscuits and perhaps add less butter to avoid the situation I had with getting the base out of the pan (which I must confess was my fault completely :) ). Thank you ROCHELE_99 you've given me an aboslutely wonderful dessert to mesmerize people with for years to come! :)

Everyone gave it rave reviews! I used Bryer's ice cream because it had the least ingredients and when you are eating something this decadent you have to watch all of those ingreds! ;) Should have made homemade whipped cream if I was truly concerned. All that aside... it was delish!

OH YUM! I didn't realize that I was out of evaporated milk, so I had to use 2%, which worked out great. Also, I subbed chocolate ice cream for the vanilla b/c I'm not a fan. I think I may have used more nuts than called for as well. This was simple to put together, but it seemed like it took forever b/c of the wait between each layer...it was worth the extra time. Hubby raved over this! Will def make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Wow!  I made this for a potluck this weekend and I was the star!  I even used low fat evaporated milk and fat free cool whip.  This did not adversely affect the taste at all... Not a bite remained and I have many requests for the recipe.

This tastes just like the original! I didn't have any cookies so I used chocolate graham wafer crumbs, mixed with margarine and a little bit of sugar for the bottom. The taste just didn't fit, I'm sure it would've been fine without them.

WOW! We have alot of birthdays in a row so I decided to try this in lieu of a birthday cake. It was a huge hit. If you love Dairy Queen's Buster Bars or Peanut Buster Parfaits this is for you! I'd give it more than 5 stars if possible, my kids loved it and it was so much more refreshing than boring birthday cake! Thanks a bunch, will be making this again for sure!

I got this recipe from my sister-in-law, & have been making this same dessert for about 20 years. It originally came from a small paperback
Pillsbury cookbook. It is requested all the time for our cook-outs and
special parties. It's a keeper, everyone loves it.

I crushed the oreos in a Ziploc bag with the other crust ingredients- thought it would be faster and easier but the crust turned out too clumpy since it is frozen- next time I will def crush in a food processor.  I used Prairie Farms Vanilla ice cream that came in a rectangle box so I could cut through it and lay big slices down on the crust and then just easily smooth it out- worked great but next time I will use a bit less ice cream as this layer seemed too thick.  I might also try a basic vanilla/fudge ice cream- not anything too busy as the dessert doesn't need much extra.  The fudge and peanuts on top were delicious.  This filled my 9X13 dish to the top so I could not add cool whip to it.  I put the cool whip on each serving but after the 1st night we decided it really doesn't need the cool whip.

Delish!  I made this for my husband for Father's Day and left off the whipped topping layer, as he isn't a huge fan.  That way he could add it later if he wanted, which he didn't (but I did!).  It is AMAZING good.  Next time I will make a half recipe in an 8x8, because I might seriously eat most of the pan.  And that will not be good.

I thought this was good but not great.  Everyone really liked it, but I think I must have done something wrong.  Maybe I added too much butter to my Oreos or something but my cookie crust got so hard and would not come out of the pan!  Even after letting it sit out for a bit to soften up.  Any suggestions on this problem would be great!  I also think I would reduce the amount of ice cream -- but that's just a personal preference.  The fudge is wonderful and it combined with the peanuts is awesome!  I didn't even add the whipped cream because I didn't think it really needed it.  I will make again but may try adding less butter to my crust.  I used light margarine so that may have been part of the problem.

Great dessert recipe!  I didn't have the cookie crust, so I pounded some chocolate cheerios, and they worked great.  I think cookies would work well too, so use what you have.  The fudge sauce is runny--not firm--until frozen, so don't let that throw you off - if you used regular fudge, it will be too hard when frozen.  I skipped the whipped topping because I thought it had enough going on, and I used regular peanut crumbs.  Fabulous - try it.

I thought this recipe was just OK.  I'm not a huge nut fan to begin with, so I would cut the peanuts by a 1/3 or 1/2 on top.  The hot fudge topping is delicious.  I think if I were to do it over again, I would make 1 1/2 times the hot fudge of what the recipe calls for.  However, I think there's better desserts out there.  I'll try something else next time.

This is one of those "to die for" recipes.  I made this for a family get together and it was such a big hit, my grandson requested this for his graduation open house.  And once again, another phenomenal hit.  Everyone was asking for the recipe. Thanks Rochele_99 for this awesome recipe.

I use hot fudge topping instead of making one. And I leave the oreos a little chunky rather than crushed and sprinkle some on top. Also slicing the box ice cream. My kids and grandkids favorite!

I made this dessert over the weekend and I always try to lighten up the fat and calories when I can. I used 1 can fat free evaporated milk and used light frozen whipped cream. I also used 1/2 can of a 12 oz Emerald  Brand Toffee Almonds crushed on half of the dessert and no spanish peanuts. I did stick with premium Vanilla Bean ice cream, 1.5 quarts. Everyone raved about it and I will definitely make it again! Thank you Rochele for sharing!

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used cocktail peanuts instead of Spanish (didn't want the red skins). I thought, given the amounts of ingredients, that it would last forever...nope. This dessert is phenomenal, so make it when you are planning to splurge. Neither myself, nor my family could stay out of the freezer! Enough said. :)

Great and easy dessert.  I  used two Oreo pie crusts.  This way we left one in the freezer until we needed it.  I also used sweetened condensed milk and decease the amount of confectioners sugar.  This one is a keeper. Thanks Rochele**99

Excellent! I made this for Easter and everyone loved it. It tasted very similar to a DQ Peanut Buster Parfait, which was always one of my favorites. I agree with other reviewers that it could have been a little fudgier. I didn't put Cool Whip on top, because I didn't think it was necessary and wouldn't be appetizing frozen. I'm sure I'll make this again, especially in the summer.

Made this for my mother-in-law for her birthday this week. Her favorite dessert is a buster bar at Dairy Queen. This dessert tasted like a buster bar. My husband said it reminded him of an ice cream Twix bar. I will definitely be making this recipe again. It has been saved in my recipe box for sure.

This was a fantastic alternative to a birthday treat in lieu of turning on the oven on a hot day...  I made half with peanuts and half with pecans since I always get my Peanut Buster Parfait made with pecans instead.  This was delicious and simple.  Can't wait to "mix it up" by using other flavored oreos, ice cream, carmel sauce, etc.

Made as stated with 2 exceptions: I only had an 80z container of whipped topping and I used bittersweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate for the fudge. All because its what I had on hand, didn't feel like running to the store. No matter, because its great! One of the rare times when my husband and son ate more of a dessert than me! This is one to make for a family get-together, all ages would love it.

Unbelievable. So good, and keeps well in freezer. Perfect summer dessert. I always hate figuring out the measurements- so it’s about 1.5 of your normal ice cream containers. I pack of Oreos. Enjoy!!!

I've been making this exact recipe for 20 years. It was originally in a Taste of Home cookbook.  The part that really favors the buster bar is the fudge sauce.  It's a lot of stirring, but totally worth it.  This is a dessert that people remember and request because it is very good.

Made this for a women's group- big hit.  Family gobbled it up as well.  Made whipped topping from scratch.  The bottom crust is difficult to spoon, even after time for softening.  I wonder if using a margarine with the cookie crumbles would work better.

Ok 
1. make the crust using softened butter and do not push down too much as it becomes VERY hard.  
2. make ATLEAST twice the sauce….it's fantastic!!!  I'd put at least 1.5 the amount in the recipe next time..
3. I think cool whip looks nice but doesn't taste as good as real!
4. save back a bit of oreo crunch for the topping.
5. last time I make this in two 9X9 pans and used a cookie rack between to freeze.

Can anyone tell me if you include the vanilla filling in the sandwhich cookies when you crush them.? And are the peanuts used in this recipe salted?  I made it without the vanilla filling and used unsalted peanuts.  It came out really well.  I was just curious.  Thanks.

I was expecting it to tast like a peanut buster parfait or a buster bar from Dairy Queen.  It did not.  The flavor was just ok.

Extremely rich and wonderful.  A small slice is very filling!  I thought the fudge sauce was very runny, but it tasted fantastic.  Perhaps I should've boiled it longer than 8 minutes?  Loved the idea of cutting the box of ice cream open and cutting slices to place on the crust!  An 8 oz. container of whipped cream was plenty to cover the peanuts and fudge layer.  My 9x13 was full to the brim!  I did crush some more oreos to decorate the top.  It was an impressive end to our Easter dinner!

Very easy to make and whole family love it!  Used only 1/2 amount of peanuts because daughter not fond of nuts but glad I did because there was plenty. Husband hoped everyone liked it so we could have it again :)

Yummy!

When I was a teenager I worked at a Dairy Queen, in th4e days when all the frozen things like Buster Bars and Dilly Bars were made by hand at the store.  (Now they're made at a factory and shipped to the stores)

Boy, if I had a dollar for every Buster Bar I made!
