I made this pie to take to my in-laws home for Easter. They usually give me a hard time about the desserts I bring, but not this time. They ate every morsel and asked if I would make it the next time we have another dinner. I used a ready-made, frozen Mrs. Smith deep-dish shortbread crust. The only change I made was using Splenda rather than regular sugar. I don't belive it altered the flavor or texture in any way. This recipe makes enough for 2 pies however there really isn't enough filling for 2 deep-dish pies. Next time I make this I will make the filling as the recipe directs however I will make an additional half recipe to fill the pie shells. I also served it with Cool Whip. Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful pie recipe. It's a new "forever favorite."

This pie was a hit at Christmas with the relatives. As others have warned, don't use the deep dish pie shells. This recipe makes enough filling for the regular size pie crusts.

The pineapple tasted good but the cream cheese layer had almost no flaver. The filling also wasn't enough to fill two 9 in pies.

We made this with a graham cracker crust and topped it with whipped cream and sprinkled the walnuts on top of that.

It was our "dish to pass" at a pig roast yesterday and was a huge hit!  We're taking the second pie to a cookout today along with copies of the recipe.

I have made this recipe twice so far and will make it many times more I am sure.The first time I didnt want to make two of these pies.Easier than cutting the filling recipe in half I made the whole thing thinking I could use the extra atop ice cream or pound cake.I did however cut the topping recipe in half.This worked out very well because there would not have been enough filling for 2 pies.My pie pan is not deep so the whole filling recipe and half the topping made a nice full pie.I didn´t have walnuts so when it came out of the oven I topped it with toasted coconut.I used my husbands family as taste testers and it was a big success,everyone loved it. The second time I made this pie I pushed a dozen cherries down into the filling before adding the cheese topping.This gave it some extra colour and a little twist to the flavor.Delicious!

Well I don't know about everyone else but I used the full recipe in one 9 inch pie shell. It filled it to about 1/2 inch from the top of the shell. This is my second time making this recipe and both times I was able to use all the ingredients in one pie. I did not 1/2 it or make less than what the recipe says. At any rate very easy to make and absolutely delicious!!!!

This pie is so yummy and so easy!  I didn't have crushed pineapple, so I whizzed pineapple chunks in the blender; and I let the filling reduce and thicken quite a bit, so there was enough for only one pie.  I will use less milk next time for the topping, as there was a bit too much topping for one pie, but not enough for two.  I sprinkled shredded coconut on top with pecans and it was really nice.

I made this exactly as directed, it was okay the first day...but it was INCREDIBLE the next day. You really should make this a day before and try your very best not to sneak any until it sets in the fridge for 24 hours, it's worth the wait! I'm saving this recipe, THANK YOU!

This recipe was passed down to me by my grandmother - and is perfect for any holiday celebration.  Definitely worth the time and effort to make it. We sprinkle ground walnuts or pecans on top - optional, of course.

This is a pie recipe from my family. My granny used to make this pie, it was always so delicious. I began making as a holiday pie years ago after she passed. I have taken it to church functions as well as friends & other extended family. It is always a hit. Everyone wants to know who made it or how to make it. Joe P who submitted it & I are cousins. Most delish pie you will ever taste. Our granny was 100 % Italian & definitely knew what she was doing in the kitchen.

I halved this recipe to make just one pie.  There was still way too much pineapple filling.  In my opinion there should be more of the cream cheese layer.  I think next time I'll do more of the cream cheese mix and blend it with the pineapple layer. I also used part splenda to make it healthier.  My family liked it, but I can improve it.

I made this with fresh pineapple.. Use 2 cups of pineapple I had pulsed in the blender till it looked like crushed pineapple and added 5 ounces of pineapple juice. I also added an extra table spoon of corn starch as it was a bit too runny... I also wanted a bit more tropical so instead of milk I yes pineapple juice and topped  with roasted coconut.. Also cut all the sugar in half as we don't like really sweet things. I also used a deep dish pie pan and there was just enough for one pie.

I thought the flavor of this pie was wonderful!  I did not try the cream cheese mixture by itself, but didn't think it was flavorless.  I agree with another reviewer that the filling wasn't enough for a deep dish pie.  I put half of the pineapple mixture in each crust and then when I went to add the cream cheese mixture, realized that it wasn't enough, so I put the whole batch of cream cheese mixture in one pie.  Next time I make this, I will put a whole batch of both the pineapple mixture and the cream cheese mixture into one 9 inch deep dish pie.  I would probably try to layer the pineapple mixture, then cream cheese then pineapple and top with cream cheese.  It is definitely WAY better the second day too, so do make this the day before and allow plenty of time to chill before serving.  My co-workers LOVED IT!  The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because I believe the measurements are off for the fillings.

I made this for my husband who loves cheesecake and pineapple.  He loved it. I thought that it would have been easier to make a cheesecake and spoon pineapple sauce over it...

I would call this a tart due to its flat appearance.  It's taste is excellent.  Next time I won't split the ingredients between two pie shells.  I will use it for just the one pie.  Great tasting pie!!

Gave five stars because even tho I didn’t do it quite right, was still pretty awesome. Hubby couldn’t get enough. So the changes: didn’t have cornstarch, so tried gelatin (didn’t work). Also, added some cinnamon and ginger to the pineapple and used Splenda-type sugar sub. Went into a ready-made chocolate crust. So, pineapple layer wasn’t proper constistancy, but flavor was nice fruity custard (with chocolate!), very much yum. Will definitely make again (with the cornstarch next time).

I was disappointed that it wasn't more flavorful. Perhaps the pie crust I used (ordinary butter) was what took away from the overall flavor.
I will try it again with a graham crust and see if it enhances the flavored more.

My mother used to make this pie when I was a child.  It was one of my favorites.  I have made it over the years and decided to make it for Easter this year.  Instead of following the instructions completely, I added an extra egg, and folded the pineapple filling into the cream cheese mixture and I used a 10" deep dish pie shell.  I baked it by the original temperatures and time but shut the oven off and left the pie in the over for an additional hour without opening the oven door.  The end result was move flavorful but more like a cheesecake in a crust rather than a pie filling.  I  think next time I will reduce the amount of sugar in the cream cheese mixture to 1/4 C. and reduce the salt to 1/4 tsp.  It seemed a bit to salty to my taste .
