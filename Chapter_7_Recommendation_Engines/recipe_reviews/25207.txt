Very healthful (little oil or sugar) but lacking a moist, "muffiny" flavor.

This is a delicious recipe. I did change it a little bit though, I used half whole wheat flour and half white, and instead of just blueberries I used a frozen field berry mix, (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries) It turned out increadibly moist and stayed soft for quite awhile. Absolutly wonderful recipe

These are good, but I don't add the vanilla.  I learned from another recipe that adding vanilla with orange substantially detracts from the orange flavor. I increased sugar to 1/3c (but with homegrown berries, increase wasn't really necessary), upped oil to 3T (due to reviews.  'Think 2T would be fine) & sprinkled a little panko on before baking 'cause I'm a wild thing.  ;D  This made twelve regular size muffins that were just a little short so maybe eleven is a better number.

No flavor to these what so ever, my boyfriend and I made them together and we (like other reviewers suggested) Used 1/3 cup sugar instead of 1/4, used a lot of orange zest and even used mixed berries instead of just the blueberries. They were still ridiculously bland and not one bit flavorful. Also, we made these in cupcake cups and half of the muffin stuck to the cup itself. Will not make again.

These are good for low-fat muffins. After looking at some of the reviews, I modified the recipe a bit...used white whole wheat flour, added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, and upped the sugar to 1/3 cup. Still not overly sweet, so may try a streusel topping on them next time.

These are good, but a little bland. I even added some orange zest, but still didn't have a lot of orange flavor. They seemed to be lacking spice, but were very moist.

I made this recipe according to recipe only using freshly squeezed orange juice. My oldest son, who is quickly becoming a little mini Chef Ramsay, helped me make these. He found them to be a little dry but both boys ate them up. I think next time, I might use half wheat flour. The amount of blueberries asked for was perfect.
