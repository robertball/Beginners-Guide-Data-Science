This is really good.  I served it on Father's day as an apppetizer and I had to print out the recipe for everyone!  Instead of making it into a ball form, I used a small bundt pan to shape it.  I spooned the strawberry preserves into the hole in the center.  Made for a very pretty presentation.  Give it a try!

I made this for a retirement party and it was a big hit.  Instead of strawberry preserves I used raspberry jam.

This is very simple, and a little bit different than your typical cheese ball. The flavors really do meld well together.

Too salty and still not sure if I will serve it a the party I made it for.  After tasting, I wanted to throw it away but a few mins later I wanted more...so who knows.  I ate a few crackers more and seem to sort of like it...we'll see what the party people say....
