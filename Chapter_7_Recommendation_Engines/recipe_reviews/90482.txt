Bacon has always been a staple in my green beans, but from now on I'll add Worcestershire and brown sugar.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I tripled the amount of green beans since it was for a picnic.  However, I only doubled the bacon, and used only one onion for the whole dish (I thought this was plenty of both, as I didn't want to overpower the beans).  Increasing the water for more beans probably was not necessary, as the time it takes to boil off 2 cups of water is about the right amount of time for the beans to get tender.  Stirring often will ensure all the beans get their fair share of time in the water.  I used a little over 3 cups but wish I hadn't, because there was too much liquid left over and I ended up pouring some of that wonderful sauce down the drain.  

I was concerned about the amount of Worcestershire in the recipe, but the brown sugar really toned it down and gave the dish a very good flavor.  Just a hint of sweetness was a nice compliment to the saltiness of the bacon and the bite in the Worcestershire.  The recipe was a hit - everyone wanted to know what that unique flavor was.

I made a few changes which made my family rave!  Many mentioned that they thought it was bland and too soft, and I think that is because some of us like green beans more crisp tender.  If you use only 1 cup water, only 3T. brown sugar, and 1/4 c. worcestershire sauce, it only takes 20- 30 minutes on medium heat (and partially covered) for the sauce to cook down.  It was great!

First, let me say that the flavor of this dish is MAGNIFICENT.  But, I had a few problems.  I followed the recipe exactly, and my liquid never evaporated.  Next time, I will only add one cup of water.  Also, I'm not crazy about soggy bacon.  I will also remove the bacon after it crisps and put it back in at the end.  The flavor should still be there if you saute the onion and garlic in the bacon grease.  Maybe then I can give the recipe 5 stars because the flavor is definitely there.

I have made this dish so many times I could now do it with my eyes closed.  My family and freinds love it.  In an attempt to save money I use canned green beans (drained) and just let everything simmer until most of the liquid is evaporated.  It is just as good as using fresh green beans and a heck of a lot easier.

I really enjoyed this recipe, although I did make changes after reading several reviews: used 1 large onion, 1 cup of chicken broth instead of water, 3 tbsp brown sugar and 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce.  I simmered on low for 30 minutes and they turned out just how I like them: not crunchy and not mushy.  Delicious!  This will now be a regular dinner side dish.

Loved it Loved it!!!  I cut the recipe in half (didn't have that many fresh green beans). Fried the bacon crispy, then removed it; then I finished following the recipe . I added the bacon about 2 minutes before serving just to have it "smothered" also. This is an excellent alternative to just plain green beans. Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing :)

Have made this dish twice already.  Did not change a thing.  Have used both canned and frozen green beans, and it was good both ways.  Even the picker eaters in my family love this recipe.  Will definitely make over and over again. Thanks for sharing.

This was a really good change from your average green bean dishes. The first time I made it using the brown sugar and it was perfect. Then I realized that by omitting the sugar and cutting down on the Worcestershire sauce, this could be a very tasty low-carb dish. So that's how I make it now for my self. If I were to make it for anyone else or bring it to a potluck I would definitely bring the sugar back!

I would give this a better rating with a few changes.  maybe 1/4 cup worcestershire, 2 Tbl. sugar and 3/4 cups of water, if you like your beans crisper...

The bacon came out pretty gross and the green beans were cooked in so much bacon grease. Next time I make this I will cook the bacon first and crispy. That's how we like it. I will save some drippings to cook the green beans in and then sprinkle the bacon on top once the green beans are done cooking.

I made this tonight as a sidedish for a tuna casserole.  My family loved it so much they went back for seconds. Because of the other reviews, I made a few adjustments.  I used only one cup water, 1/4 of a lrg onion and 1/4 cup brown sugar and wor. sauce each.  It still came out too sweet in the end I put lots of salt and pepper to taste and it came out perfect. Thanks

MY LIQUID DIDN'T ABSORB ALL THE WAY, I ADDED A SMALL AMOUNT OF FLOUR TO TAKE CARE OF THAT PROBLEM. NEXT TIME I'LL USE 1 ONION AND MORE GREEN BEANS.I FLAVOR WAS VERY UNIQUE.

Tried this recipe out for a pre-Thanksgiving recipe testing dinner. None of us were crazy about them.  I prefer canned green beans, but wanted to give fresh a try.  I didn't get that "green" flavor that I dislike about fresh beans at least.  But I didn't really care for the sweetness of this dish.  Everyone else voted to keep the Campbell's green bean casserole for The Day... I'll keep searching for another green bean dish!

I didnt use as much bacon or Worcestershire sauce as this recipe called for and it still had way too much of each.  Everything smelled great until I added the last 4 ingredients.  Next time I'll try with a small amount of w sauce and less bacon.

This was a big hit.  And the two cups of water was too much even when I almost doubled the recipe, so a cup should suffice for normal serving size.  I'm going to try it next with a bit of finely chopped red bell pepper added for the last few minutes of simmering.

I don't have a large skillet, so I removed the bacon and then added in step two, with the water. This recipe just made my week! We had it over rice, and then I snuck some more before going to bed. I am going downstairs to finish it shortly. Oh and I didn't let all of the water evaporate so I could use the sauce on the rice--very good!

Excellent with minor adjustments.  I would decrease the bacon to 1/2 lb unless you like bacon a lot.  I decreased the Worcestershire and brown sugar to 1/4 cup each and it was still plenty sweet.  If you don't like sweet then decrease the sugar further.

The only thing i did different was use thick, peppered bacon.  It was absolutely delicious and was the first dish polished off..

I started out to make recipe as written; however I did make a few changes. I only used one medium onion and I doubled the brown sugar. Served it as part of our Easter dinner. It was well received. When I make again, I will be sure to drain some drippings from bacon before adding water to pan.

I drained the bacon fat and used 1 spoon of butter instead. Cook the onions with garlic and added the bacon later. LOOOVED IT

These were made for our Christmas dinner and they went quick. I used bacon ends and sautéed the onions and the bacon together before adding the rest of the ingredients. I didn't use as much brown sugar as called for and it still was pretty sweet. I love the added flavor it gave. We love this as our green bean side dish and make it a lot but it with these ingredients. Will make again for sure. Thank you for the recipe.

I make a similar dish and use chicken broth instead of Worcestershire and water. It's always a hit and frequent Thanksgiving Day guest. I don't use as much liquid as this recipe calls for, and as other reviewers have mentioned.

Its tasty but too sweet and tasted too much like W. sauce. Will stick with "Smothered Green Beans" recipe off AR or decrease the sugar and W. sauce next time.

Loved this combination.  Tastes great and smells so good while cooking.  I didn't have enough bacon on hand so needed to add a little bacon grease to saute the onions.

These were o.k. I don't think I would make these again and nobody else liked the either.
