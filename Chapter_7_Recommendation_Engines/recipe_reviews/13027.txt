I tried this with company.It was great. Makes a lot. I’ve made bf. stw. all my life but it was always bland. Spic it up and it's still spicy bland stew.  The secret is the rosemary. Unlikely, but you don’t taste it too much and it is a perfect compliment to the stew flavors. Glad there's no celery. Never liked it. Used canned corn and green beans. Added a big onion cut up in chunks. Beef stew without onions is unthinkable! Left out the rice. Made some on the side so people could spoon their stew on top of it. Made this all in the microwave. Not a big timesaver. Browned the meat and pre-cooked the carrots, potatoes and onions before “stewing” it. Cook on high for about 20 mins. Then simmer, covered, on a medium setting for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally, to get the meat tender. Gravy was thinner than I like. Stirred in about 3 Tbsp. of cornstarch dissolved in hot water to thicken. Like it dark brown so I added a tsp. more of the browning sauce. Also added about 2 tsp. of Accent (msg) and 1/3 cup of dry sherry.  Some folks thought they needed to salt it more.  The colorful vegetables make it appetizing looking for ordinary stew. I’ll make my beef stew like this again and again.

This is a great stew recipe! I did make some changes. I put seasoning salt and garlic powder in the flour before I covered the beef. Instead of 6 cups of water I used 3 cups beef broth and 3 cups water. I didn’t have any fresh vegetables so I used 2 cans of mixed vegetables and 1 can of whole carnal corn. I really like rice so I used 1 whole cup. Every thing else I did just as the recipe said. Tasted Amazing!! Thanks for sharing!!

This stew had a great texture but not much flavor.  The meat was incredibly tender but I had to add a lot of seasonings to give it any flavor at all.  OK start for a recipe but it needs work.

This was pretty good, although not great. My 6 yr old son loved it and asked for seconds. I felt it was a little too thick, but I will tweek it and make it again. Thank you

It was a good recipe although I prefer long grain and not instant rice in this recipe.  Instant would be quicker but I prefer the taste of long grain rice.

I use this recipe time and time again for my family, they all love it. The only thing I do is to omit the spices and instead add a package of McCormick Beef Stew seasoning mix...saves time and gives just the right flavor. Serve it with a dollop of sour cream on top...soooo yummy! Many friends have requested this recipe - thank you very much for posting it - it is one of my staples!

This recipe gets 3 stars because as written there is too much veggies to water and it did not thicken (with original amount of water) in my crock pot. So I decided to play with it ,and found with 2 more cups of water and some cornstarch to thicken it this became more of a  stew  that we are used too.Next time I will add some garlic and a bit more rosemary.

This stew was good, but not fabulous. I guess that there are a couple of things that I would change. I would probably add some red wine to add more depth to the flavors. I would recommend either using a sprig of rosemary or wrapping the herbs in a bouquet garni so that the dried rosemary leaves aren't floating in the soup. But a decent basic recipe.

Just tried this and as my first attempt at beef stew, it was delicious! But I did make the following changes: used 3 cups of water and 2 cans of beef broth, I seasoned the meat with seasoning salt, Accent, and black pepper before browning it, threw in a packet of McCormick beef stew seasoning. After letting it simmer for an hour, I added in about 1/2 of a chopped onion, and if you want a nice thick, hearty broth add in about 4 tbspn of thickening (flour + cold water) after adding in the potatoes and other veggies. You won't need any more flavoring than this! And the meat will be nice and tender. The other thing I did is cooked the rice on the side and served the stew on top of the rice. My hubby and kids went for 2nds and so did I!

Great base for a stew, very easy to personalize! I had peas instead of green beans and used sweet potato. I also added onion and garlic powder. Tasted delicious!

I always add onion (sometimes pearl onions) and worstechire sauce, among some other things.  I get creative to add flavor to this.  Pretty good on its own, but I'd rather have more flavor.

This Beef Stew was very good however I made a few adjustments. Nice and hearty on a cold day. I added one can of beef broth and reduced the water by that much. Also add one small onion (Chopped) as well as added a clove of garlic while it was simmering. I would prepare it again the same way.

This recipe was very good!  I made a few changes.  I added parsnip, 2 bay leaves.  I substituted 1 can of whole kernel corn (undrained) and a can of green beans (drained).  I will make this again.

I thought it was good. It was a little bland, so I added some spices. I wasn't sure what brown sauce is, so maybe that is where the flavor is suppose to come from? Overall, I would suggest trying it. It's a great base and you can get creative with it.

I did not like this at all.  It looked so good too but there was just no flavor and for me, I don't want to have to keep adding stuff to a recipe.  I don't really enjoy cooking so I want a recipe that is going to be good and not me having to add things to it to make it good.  The beef really was nice and tender but it wasn't enough to save this stew.  We ended up getting a pizza instead =(

Used canned veggies and this still tasted great!  I didn't have browning sauce nor could I find it at the store, but it was still great without.  I also didn't add the rice to keep a little healthier.  I did add a couple of bay leaves and thyme.

this was a great stew i did a few changes nothing major but overrall amazing  my kids loved it!!! All i did was cut half a white onion and caramalized it then added the meat with it. While it was cooking i added Werstischire sauce and a beef bouillon. Test the salt being that there was a lot of water it ends up washing away the flavor thats when i continued to add some spices and some more salt to taste of course! mine came out not too salty with a punch of flavor i was happy....thanks for this recepie
