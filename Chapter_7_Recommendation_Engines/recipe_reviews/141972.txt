Really good and easy.  I used butter flavor shortening, and brushed w/ melted butter when they came out of the oven.  If you don't have self-rising flour, add 1 1/2t of baking powder and 1/4 to 1/2t salt to each cup of all purpose flour.

OMG! These biscuits are incredible! They're so easy to make and they come out light, moist, and fluffy. Plus they rise nice and high - what more could you want from a buttermilk biscuit! I used butter-flavored shortening and didn't change a thing. I left the dough in the fridge for only 6 hours as I didn't have the luxury of overnight and they still turned out perfect.  I brushed the tops with melted butter during the last five minutes of baking and WOW what a great biscuit!

Best Recipe Ever!!!  Be sure to use self rising flour in the dough, but use all purpose flour to roll out your biscuits on.   Be careful not to twist your biscuit cutter or they will not rise well;  push straight down and lift up.  Also, lay biscuits on baking sheet slightly touching each other.

Finally the biscuit I was looking for! They were fluffy, flaky and yummy. So easy to pull out in the morning roll out the dough and bake.  I did not have  rising flour so I added 6 teaspoons of baking powder to my flour and 2 teaspoons of Kosher salt to the flour. I also brushed the biscuits with melted butter before I put them in the oven. I placed the biscuits slightly touching.

Was there an oversight on the overnight biscuits?  Should there not be some baking powder added in there somewhere?  I made these & was most careful to follow instructions exactly since I was really looking forward to them.  But they came out flat & uncooked, even after an extra 10 minutes in the oven.

Best biscuits I've ever made at home, and my kidlet is always asking me to make them.  I love being able to start these the night before and let them rest.  I don't keep self-rising flour around, so following another user's tip, I added 2 tbsp baking powder and 1 tbsp salt to the flour.  They turned out perfect - high and light, and melts-in-your-mouth.  Note that the dough is really sticky when you dump it out of the bowl.  Also, remember not to twist the biscuit cutter when you make the circles if you want high biscuits. Changes: I like these better with butter-flavor shortening, just a personal preference.  Also, I've subbed up to 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat pastry flour for a nutritional boost, and it did not affect the recipe.  Dumped in a tbsp of garlic powder & a mix of herbs one time for herbed garlic biscuits, and that was a very yummy change-up.  Thanks for posting this recipe, it's my new standard.  EDIT: made them last night but forgot the buttermilk - used just plain 'ole almond milk.  They still rose as good as the Bisquick ones do, and tasted great.  These are truly foolproof.

This is a great recipe. I used butter flavored shortening and good quality flour(White Lilly)and the biscuits were fluffy and were not crumbly at all. I left them in the fridge for about 12 hours. I have never made biscuits from scratch and these biscuits could have passed for "Grannies Old Recipe". I used to bake pound cakes years ago in a country restaurant and I found that using a quality name brand flour is super important. I think that the flour I used in this recipe was a key to the success of my first try. I highly reccommend the butter flavored shortening as well. If you follow the recipe, you can't miss with Teena's OSB Biscuits!!

Great recipe!  My family loved them and my husband thought they were as good or better than what most restaurants serve. I followed the recipe but was only able to give them 7 hours in the fridge. They were tender, flavorful and got higher than I expected. We served them with beef stew and they were a hit. Next time we will have them for breakfast with sausage gravy. Yum!

These were tasty biscuits!  I substituted half of the shortening with butter, but kept everything else the same.  I also just cut mine into squares with a pizza cutter.  They rise super high this way!  Delicious!

This is the first time I have made roll-out biscuits, and they turned out great!  I made the dough in the morning and put it in the fridge all day then baked them for dinner that night. Thanks for the tip on not turning the glass when cutting them out.  And thanks to the reviewer who gave the baking soda/salt measurements when using all-purpose flour instead of self-rising.  I used them (with the higher salt as my husband likes his salt) and they worked great.  Like one other person I found that I had to add a little more flour to the dough, but that was no big deal.

Biscuits have always been my downfall. I have tried a bazillion different recipes, and THIS is the ONE! Easy, and they come out PERFECT. I love that I can throw them together the night before then just bake them. I am not a morning person, so these are great. I made them for the first time today and DH requested them again for tomorrow. Great recipe, thanx!

These are soo good and light and fluffy!  They taste like something you get at a restaurant!  They are so easy to make and with a few ingredients!  I will be making these again!  I made them the night before, so they would be ready for breakfast.  I even rolled & cut them out and arranged into my pan and covered with plastic wrap and set in fridge overnight.  

         Ok, I didn't have self-rising flour, so i did this (1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. salt= that makes 1 cup of slf-rising flour). 
      I also, didn't have buttermilk and just used 1 TBL of vinegar in a measuring cup and filled the rest with milk and let it sit for 10 minutes.  I did use 1 stick cold butter instead of shortening.  Then added 1 tsp. of vanilla.  I was able to get 11 biscuits.  These came out so good and I love them!

                   UPDATE:  I made these again and used 1/2 cup of shortening and they were very fluffy and delicious!  I did add 1 tsp vanilla and rolled them out and got 14 biscuits.  I rolled them out about 1/2 in thickness instead of 1 inch.  They rose fine and were not oversized.    I love these biscuits!  They are so easy and so yummy!

Use butter flavored shortening...and add a little extra sugar.  Absolutely fantastic biscuits, the whole fam and my bf love these.  Honey butter is a wonderful accompaniment... 1/3 c. honey to one stick is the best ratio in my opinion.  YUM!

This is one recipe that I would give more stars to if I could...they are that good! I loved that the dough was made the night before, because it makes life easier the next day. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I used the 'self-rising flour' substitute recipe from here, as I do not keep that on hand. I got 16 of the most tender, delicious, beautifully risen homemade biscuits. I was actually proud of myself at how well these turned out, lol! This will be my new go-to biscuit recpe from now on! Thanks for sharing. :)

I had to make my own 'buttermilk' by adding 2Tbsp of vinegar to my whole milk.  Then I let it sit on the counter while I gathered the ingredients.  This morning I was able to bake the lovely biscuits while I made the sausage gravy.  My husband loved them!  Making food yourself is not only more satisfying than opening a can, it's better for you and the environment.  Thanks for the recipe, it reminded me of wonderful summers in Alabama with my grandparents.  Gran made light and fluffy biscuits EVERY morning.  It's wonderful to wake up to the warm aromas of a cooking breakfast.  Maybe it will help me wake up my teenagers!

I forgot to mention I got 18 biscuits out of this recipe, I rolled them out to about 1/2inch and they were cut about the size of a sausage patty.  Next time I will make them a little thicker and bigger for gravy.

Finally, a biscuit recipe I can make and have rise!! This is very good. 

Self rising flour is called for in the recipe and it will not turn out at all if you don't use it. I like Lilly.

These are good.  The biscuits turn out soft with a moist inside.  I subbed a couple tablespoons butter for some of the shortening for flavor and flakiness.  I've been making biscuits for 35 years, and these are some of the easiest and certainly most convenient.  I still prefer my usual recipe when I want flaky biscuits, but these are great when I want softer biscuits.  They get 5 stars for the ease and the taste!  NOTE to anyone making this recipe...you cannot use all-purpose flour unless you add your leavening ingredients and make your own self-rising flour!

Fabulous!!! I made these with the modifications for regular flour. I've actually made them twice. We loved them the first time, but the second time brushed them with melted butter and viola! Just like KFC!!! (and the second time I only had them in the fridge for about four hours) My new go to recipe!

I am pretty sure I reviewed this already, but I couldn't find my review, so I'm reviewing again!  This Buttermilk biscuit recipe is amazing!  I have made them a few times now.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I used a buttermilk substitute - 2 TBSP white vinegar + enough milk to equal 2 cups.  I also added a pinch of salt to the recipe.  This recipe made 18 biscuits for me, however I didn't have a 2" biscuit cutter and used a cup.  My dough may not of been rolled 1" thick either.  I baked 4 biscuits immediately after I allowed the dough to rest.  Then I wrapped the remainder dough in saran wrap and placed in the fridge for about 6-7 hours.  I cut my biscuits and took out about 6 and froze those and baked the rest.  In my opinion, whether baked immediately or after allowing to sit in fridge, they were amazing.  The frozen ones were still good, but not as amazing as the fresh, they seemed a little dense.  I put them on a cookie sheet frozen, used a preheated oven at 400 and baked until browned, about 24 minutes.   This will be my Buttermilk Biscuit recipe from now on!

Thanks to the user who included the substitution for all-purpose flour (add 2 Tablespoons baking powder, 1 T salt). I made sure not to wiggle the cutter and these biscuits doubled in height! I would keep them 2-inches in diameter. I cut out 12 2-inch biscuits and still had extra dough so I just cut out 3-inch biscuits. Those big ones doubled in height and fell over half-way through cooking. But big or little, these taste wonderful and are super easy!

Really happy with this recipe. Biscuits are a little dense but very tasty. The first time I made them I made the dough too flat and they came out small, the second time I made sure the raw biscuits were good thick and it came out much better. Enjoying my leftover turkey breast on these leftover biscuits from Thanksgiving!!

I have been trying to make buttermilk biscuits like this since I left the South over 10 year ago and even with an altitude of 7200 feet these worked great.  With a little sausage and homemade apple butter I could just as easily be at my grandmother's for Saturday morning breakfast!

hmmmm, im going to give this a three star because I was disappointed that it didn't rise as high as I hoped. It was good and I was happy with the simple ingredients. I found that the dough was a bit sticky when I was kneading it in the beginning. I dont know if this is the way it should be but I followed the recipe as is.   As per others suggetions I will try it with butter flavored shortening the next time to see how that is. Other than that, it didnt taste floury at all which I was happy about.

Allow dough to come to room temp (30 min or more) before cutting biscuits or putting in oven.   I cut the recipe in half, and added 1 cup of whole wheat flour (I used Gold Medal brand Whole Wheat flour but I prefer the finer texture of King Arthur brand Whole Wheat flour instead).  I omitted the sugar, used butter instead of shortening. I didn't have a sifter so I used a strainer instead and moved the flour through in a bouncing motion, a sifter is better but a wire mesh strainer will do the job in a pinch (if you have two you could layer them on top of each other for a finer strain).  Happy baking!

Excellent biscuits.  For those complaining of an oversight on the recipe...please note that the recipe calls for "SELF RISING" flour, and not All Purpose.  Self rising flour has baking soda and salt already added in.  If you don't have self rising, a simple recipe is 1 Cup of all purpose flour, 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt equals one cup of self rising flour.  Obviously you would quadruple that for this particular recipe as it calls for four cups of self rising flour.  Thanks for the delicious, easy recipe, LAGIRL!

This is a great recipe! I used bread flour with 6 tsp. baking powder and 2 tsp. sea salt. I also used butter instead of shortening. I baked half of the batch right away and they were delecious! (The refridgerated ones were even better).

I am a biscuit lover who for the life of me has never been able to make a biscuit. Until tonight, these are awesome! Like others I do not keep self rising flour on hand so I mixed up the self rising flour from AR, works great! I also used butter flavor crisco sticks and made my own buttermilk, I do 1 Tbsp. vinegar to 1 cup whole milk. I refrigerated the dough for 4 hrs. These were mile high, flaky and moist, just pure yum! A huge hit with the hubby and son, which is a plus! No need to look further for a great biscuit recipe, I have found my go to with this one, thanks so much!

This recipe is missing ingredients- it was a big flop.  I made the dough with my 6 year old son, and we were both disappointed when the biscuits didn't grow, and were raw inside...  I'm going to try "fluffy Biscuits" next with Nancy Horsburgh's recipe-

Only 5 hrs of resting and 3 grandkids all clammering to help cut & roll out - flour here / flour there - and they still tasted absolutely fantastic.  My new favorite biscuit recipe.  I can't wait to see how they turn out once I have a change to make them in peace and quiet lol

I have tried so many biscuit recipes, searching for the ultimate, and this is the only recipe I have found, so far, that doesn't have a floury taste.  They were so good not only in flavor, but also in texture.  My biscuit recipe search stops here!

I made these the other day for sausage, gravy, and biscuits, but honestly we couldn't stop eating them in time for the gravy to finish cooking. I didnt have two cups of buttermilk so I used one cup of buttermilk and one cup of skim milk with some melted butter in it. I must say this is the first time i have made biscuits successfully and my family LOVES them. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is an awesome reciepe! Making it the day before made breakfast a breeze.  I am going to freeze the unused dough to make fast school morning breakfasts.  I followed another members suggestion to add kosher salt, a tsp was all that was needed and it gave the biscuit extra flavor, I used parchment paper on the baking pan and they turned out perfectly.  Thanks so much for this reciepe, it is a keeper.

Works out perfect everytime.  I have made them and used the dough right away with great results as well.  The flavor is more fully developed overnight, however.

These biscuits really plumped up! I added some baking powder as others suggested, and used milk that was one day beyond it's expiration date. The result was a fluffy, flavorful biscuit. These biscuits were delicious!

This recipe is amazing.  I was afraid I'd over kneaded the dough too much, but they turned out great.  I think the sugar gives it a little different taste than I'm used to, but they're very good as is.  I think I might try leaving it out the next time I make them.

I found these biscuits to be very light fluffy and tastey, the Buttermilk and a nice touch.    My problem is with the cooking temperature- They did not have time to brown on top before the bottoms were over-cooked.  I will lower the temp to 415* next time to see if that helps. I also will try brushing the tops with butter on a few to see if that helps them brown faster.  Great biscuits !

finally! ive been determined to make bicuits like my grandma used to make. I live abroad with no access to biscuit mixes or store bought biscuits so miss them terribly . I have had some failures with other recipes but finally success with this one. i halved the recipe to try it the first time and followed the ingredients exactly . handle the dough as little as possible and follow the suggestion of not twisting the glass when u cut them . id like them to be a big " higher" but the texture is superb and the flavor delicious. cant wait to try them again. may try cutting them and freezing them so I can just take them from the freezer to bake when desired!

Very Good although I prefer a other recipe on this site. Didn't rise like I was expecting thought they should go higher than what they did-not sure what I did wrong, had a good can of baking powder.

I did not have self- rising flour only all-purpose flour. So for each cup of all-purpose flour, I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. The biscuits turned out wonderfu.l

I followed this recipe to the letter and these biscuits turned out very well.  My son really enjoyed them. We had these for Sunday breakfast and even reheated them on Monday and Tuesday for breakfast.  Very good....

These were really good. It was my first try with buttermilk biscuits. I did have to add more flour because it was too sticky to knead, but other than that they turned out great!

Biscuits came out fairly well. They were not the best ive ever had, but i'll continue to tweak the recipe untill I get exactly what it is that im looking for. This was my first time making biscuits from scratch, and I think that it was an okay starter recipe.

Make sure you use self-rising flour (as the recipe states) and not all purpose flour.  Self-rising already has the baking powder and salt added.

These were the best, most fluffy and tasty biscuits I have ever made, even though I didn't have buttermilk.  I think the sugar must have increased the rise.  I made 1-1/2 recipes, using 2 cups whole milk, 1 cup heavy cream and 3 tbsp. white vinegar.  I did have to add an extra cup of flour (total of 7 cups) and I added 1 tsp of baking powder and 1/2 tsp of salt.  I cooked 4 biscuits for supper tonight and have 3 cake pans full in the refrigerator for tomorrow morning to take to a breakfast at work.

I have no idea why everyone says this is good. The dough is too wet to knead (all it did was stick to my hands and the kneading surface) and adding enough flour to do so makes the biscuits inedible. What am I doing wrong?!

Made my own self rising flour and added a bit more baking powder. (oops)
It was GREAT biscuit recipe considering mine turn into hockey pucks with every other recipe.
I ended up using half and half considering I had no milk on hand.
The only thing I would change for my taste (again this is a spectacular recipe) is use a 1/2 butter and half shortening 
 for the fat. I think it could us a bit more sugar and that may have something to do with the extra baking powder I used. 
But they turned out light and not super dense!! And for anyone that suffers from this, this would be a perfect way to go!
Thank you Teena!

I've made a few biscuit recipes, and this is the best. They rose really high, and I liked the convenience of making the dough ahead of time. The taste and texture were excellent. In the past I've made all-butter biscuit recipes; I think the shortening in this recipe might be the key.

These were tasty, fluffy, and easy to make. A suggestion:  after you roll them out in the morning, fold in half and gently roll out 2 more times for maximum height after baking. When you pull together your scraps, do the same. The air in the layers gives extra height to the biscuits. Also, it is good to have them slightly touching in the pan and to bake them a for the longer time to be sure the centers are done. I baked mine with spelt flour and white flour, adding baking powder, soda and Salt since they were not self rising, and used half shortening and half butter.

Cook Celia, self-rising flour already has the baking powder in it.  These are very good.  I made them for my daughter-in-law's graduation breakfast.  Everybody loved them.

Thanks so much for this recipe!  Finally a biscuit that I can make!  I have a large Oster toaster oven; so the temp was reduced to 375 degrees.  Made it with sour milk, chilled shortening and the homemade self rising flour recipe from this website.  

 The chilled shortening was cut into small pieces from the cup and incorporated.  After stirring, the dough is very loose and has a lumpy batter appearance.  I scooped it out onto the floured surface and began sprinkling small amounts of AP flour on the dough as it was folded onto itself about 20 times.  The dough looked similar to yeast roll dough.  I sprayed the container with Pam and chilled overnight.  A half recipe worked well and produced about 6 square biscuits and one large round one from scraps.

We did not have self-rising  flour, therefore I followed recipe and added baking powder and salt.  This did not work for me, the biscuits were flat and tasteless.

The crumb of these biscuits was closed because it calls for the shortening to be cut in much too finely. The end result was stodgy and butter had a difficult time penetrating  it. The flavor was rather bland compared to biscuits made with butter. I did find it very convenient to make the night before though, and they rose just fine in the oven.

Finally a perfect biscuit! I always struggle w biscuits for some reason but I nailed these. In the morning the dough was VERY easy to work with and baked up into big fat fluffy biscuits, perfect w sausage gravy (and butter & honey). These were still good the next day. I used the last few for breadcrumbs and made meatballs out of it and they were fantastic.

I was a bit anxious about this recipe.  I live in a humid climate and had to add more flour during the kneading process than most probably would.  Trust!  They came out amazingly! For something where you can do half of the work the night before these are unbeatable.  For those who had trouble, be sure you're using unexpired SELF-RISING flour; the baking powder in it still has to be active.

How great are these southern biscuits! I made my own self rising flour and I used buttermilk powder and water since I always keep that on hand. (but not always have buttermilk).
They are so delightful. I am going to serve with at Thanksgiving with ham! Yum!

As a first time biscuit maker I have a question. When the directions state "Wrap in plastic wrap and refridgerate overnight" do you place them in a bowl and then cover the bowl in plastic wrap or literally wrap the ball of dough fully in plastic wrap? How does the dough rise if it is wrapped fully in plastic wrap?

These were ok, but not as good as the buttermilk biscuits I grew up with. They rose beautifully but there just wasn't much taste to them. They would probabaly be pretty good with honey or something sweet on them, but just with butter they were a little lackluster. I think if I make them again I will leave them in the oven a little longer, too. They were a little on the doughy side.

These are the best biscuits I ever made! Kudos to Tina. Fluffy and flaky and tender - yum! I did make one slight change - instead of shortening, I used half lard and half butter. Excellent!

These are so much like my Grandmother's biscuits.  I did not change a thing on your recipe.  The tip about not twisting, and letting them set a bit before putting in oven the cutter was great!  I've always twisted, but did not this time, and they rised higher.

These are probably the best homamade biscuits that I've ever made, and I even screwed up and put in WAY to much baking powder! (I didn't have self rising flour, so I used the recipe that reviewer ADRI122 left) Very good biscuits! This will be my new go to recipe :)

Wow!  These were the best biscuits that I have ever made.  The rose really well in the oven and went great with the sausage gravy I made!

I really liked these, but my husband and his family thought that they tasted bitter. I'm not sure why since there isn't any baking powder in them. I guess they weren't sweet enough for their tastes. :0(

I made these for an office function, though I have never tasted them, and they were a GIGANTIC hit!  Thank you so much for posting!  You made me look like a total rock star!  I did finally have one a few hours later and they were great even cold.  Going to make a batch with some garlic and cheese in it.  No modifications needed and thanks to the person that posted how to make regular flour self rising!

While they rose very high which is good, they weren't the best. Fairly bland. However, I had to use buttermilk substitute. I'll try these again but I think I'll use butter flavored shortening as one reviewer suggested and I'll get some real buttermilk. Also, makes more than what it says. I adjusted the recipe to make 12, I used a glass to cut out the biscuits and the mouth is 3 1/2 inches and it made 13. If you were using a two inch cutter, you would have a lot more biscuits than you were expecting. I rolled mine fairly thick too. I'm trying to find a recipe (or create one) that mimicks the buttermilk biscuits at the Loveless Cafe in Tennessee. These don't even TOUCH those biscuits. Better than others I've tried. But still just OK.

I had some buttermilk that I needed to use up when I found this recipe. It is FABULOUS and SO easy! I loved being able to make the dough last night, then just roll out, cut and bake this morning. They are fantastic! Thanks for a great recipe. It's a keeper for sure!

This recipe is the best! My son loves buttermilk biscuits said these are his new favorite. It is great being able to make the dough the night before, I used a baking stone to bake them on and they turned out perfect! Excellant with sausage gravy too:)

Saw this recipe at 5:50 this morning and I had to try it.  Sausage biscuits and gravy was on the menu for dinner so I gave them a try.  They were amazing, the guys loved them!!!

These are as stated - light and a perfect texture.   Cook Celia had trouble and questioned why there was no baking powder - self-raising flour has the baking powder already in the mix. You can't use all purpose.  Good luck the next time because they do work.
