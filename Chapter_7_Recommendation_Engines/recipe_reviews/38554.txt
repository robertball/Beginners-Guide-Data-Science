I have to wonder if Muse tried this recipe before he submitted it, or if there's an error printed because there is no way this bacon will cook in 8 minutes! More like 15 for me and I only used about a fourth of a package! I took half a pound of bacon, cut them in half widthwise, and used half of those. I then decreased the amount of sugar. I also found it easier to coat the bacon slices in a ziploc bag. I highly recommend wrapping your baking sheet with aluminum foil because this gets so sticky and messy.Also, don't cool the bacon on paper towels because I found out the hard way that the bacon will stick to the paper. But in the end this tasted absolutely fantastic. It's very important to let the bacon cool a bit because it will crisp up more.

Great way to serve bacon.  I make a change though, instead of cinnamon, we shake on a bit of dry yellow mustard.  This gives the bacon a tangy zip that works well with the sugar's sweetness.  We use the broiling pan, lining both the inside and outside with foil.  Cut a few small slits in the foil on the top pan, so the grease drains to the bottom.

REALLY TASTY, Thank you Muse.  I changed things just a little bit. After coating the bacon I twisted it as suggested by another reader. I also cooked the bacon for 10 minutes at 400 instead of the recommended 375. After 5 minutes I turned the bacon over.  After cooking,I drained the bacon and then refrigerated (covered and on paper towels). The next day when company came, I zapped the bacon in the microwave to take the chill out.  Absolutely wonderful. Thank you

I cooked it at 400 degrees, I coated it in a ziploc, twisted it & cooked it on a wire rack over a foil-lined baking sheet.I served this for Mother Day brunch w/ Swiss Cheese Souffles, Simple Scones, Melon Fruit Bowl & Party Mimosas (all from allrecipes). Thansk for your contribution to a wonderful brunch...my guests were delighted.

A good presentation for this recipe is to twist the bacon a few times when arranging it in the pan.  It will stay in that corkscrew shape after cooking.  Watch carefully at the end of cooking so that the sugar doesn't burn.  Delicious!

Oh my goodness this is sooo good...
I tried this several different ways,I love to experiment in the kitchen, so I tried about eight pieces all different. Four I used brown sugar and four I decided to try dipped in honey. I tried the same things for both the honey and brown sugar: on one piece the cinnamon, on the second piece was mustard powder as another reviewer suggested, third was hot pepper (going for the sweet and spicy idea) and then the fourth was just the sugar/honey, nothing else.
The honey bacon was ok but not great, had kind of a burnt flavor, plus it didn't stick/caramelize as well as the brown sugar.
The pieces that were plain, and the ones with mustard and with hot pepper were all good, but the cinnamon/brown sugar mixture was by far the best, with the hot pepper coming in second. But you have to make sure you add enough cinnamon, otherwise you won't taste it. You also have to cook the bacon long enough that the sugar starts to caramelize.
One final note: I did mine with thick cut bacon. While this was good, it did take a while to cook and didn't get as crispy as I would have liked. I know a lot of people are having trouble getting their bacon to cook, because of the syrup consistency of the sugar...the cooling rack is a good idea as well as using a thinner cut bacon. Just make sure you cook it until dark brown. When you lift the bacon up you'll see strings where the sugar has almost hardened,
DELICIOUS!

This recipe was a big hit at a brunch I gave.  My only suggestion is that the bacon must be cooked for at least 10 minutes to be fully cooked.  I will be making this recipe again!

As if bacon wasn't good enough already and now this... sweet and smoky bacon. Yumm! I cooked this at 400* as recommended on my package of bacon for 15 minutes and it was well done. I had trouble with the edges getting too crispy. Definitely use the foil as the sugar carmelizes and makes a really sticky mess on the pan. The bacon tended to get stuck at the edges and didn't want to release from the pan. I couldn't really tell the cinnamon was there because the sugar was strong. Very good, Thanks!

I make this with blueberry pancakes....everybody loves it. I didn't have anything in the house but Splenda blend brown suger and that gave this an even better flavor. I bake it at 425 until it starts to brown...I watch it carefully...2 slices could be done, you take those out turn your back for 2 minutes and the rest are toast....! So, I always cover everything in foil, spray the foil and "drain" on wax paper. I don't turn mine either. I have to hide plates of this in the cabinets if I'm making a lot - the kids won't let it cool. This is best served when cooled - otherwise you will burn your mouth - this is essentially caramel and its like lava. My girlfriend sprinkles hers with cayenne pepper, cuts it up and serves it as an appetizer with toothpicks in it at parties. Hope you enjoy!

I just know this bacon would  have been delicious ..... if I had not BURNED it.  MY bad.... After 8 minutes and still not crispy enough for my liking, I decided to turn on the broiler "for just a minute"  Next thing you know the house is filled with smoke!  I will make this again and pay closer attention.   ;)

Tough, chewy, and much too sweet. AND I had a sticky pan to clean. I rate it 2 stars because it sparked a better idea. Cook bacon as you usually do until crisp, then lightly drizzle it with a brown sugar/cinnamon sauce. Much better!

This was a great way to change up bacon.  I loved the sweet salty combo.  I can't wait to try it with the mustard powder like  crfisch suggested.  I was baking something else and put this in a 350 oven and left it in for about 15 minutes.  It crisped up as it cooled.  It was cooked perfect!  I can't wait to make it again.  Thanks Muse!

Where has this recipe been hiding all my life?  Needless to say we loved it. I prepare the bacon as directed but increasing the cooking time to 15 minutes.  To make clean up easier I place the bacon on a cooling rack that has been sprayed with with Pam. Next I put the cooking rack on a foil lined cookie sheet.

I first saw this recipe in the Sweet Potato Queens first book; the author calls it "pig candy".  I've made it, but without the cinnamon mentioned here; I will have to try that.  One thing that helps me is to cook the bacon on a rack, rather than directly on the pan.  It still takes more than 8 minutes, but is definitely worth the wait.  It can be allowed to cool on the rack, and with less mess. It can also be chilled and eaten later, that is--if there is any left over.  Pretty dang decadent, in an unsophisticated way!!!

I saw Paula Deen do this years ago and tried it!  Delicious!! If you are having trouble with the bacon being limp, try putting a cooling rack inside the pan, so that the heat circulates all around the bacon. It will get super crisp!  Also, the fat drips away!  I don't care for cinnamon, but love the idea of the pepper or cayenne! I will definitely try the Blue Agave...that sounds awesome!! We don't eat bacon often, but this is our favorite!!  It's a guilty pleasure:)

As others suggested, definitely a higher heat and a longer cook time. But the recipe? Good god I love pig!! Coat it in sugar and well... I'm just hoping there's a 12 step group to get me through this binge!!

This is good but I really wasn't keen on the cinnamon.  I prefer using bacon that has been laid out on cookie sheets and drizzled with good maple syrup and cracked black pepper the baked to crispness...MMMM

I have never left a review before, but couldnt wait to review THIS one!!!  all I can say my family said was "AWESOME MOM".  I didnt get a peice, so have to go on my family's  taste buds.  It just vanished.  I did make a mistake tho, I always buy the THICK cut.  as i re-read the directions, it was supposed to be the thin sliced bacon.  I just fried it first, slathered it as well as I could, it was hot, and placed in on a Pam sprayed pan.  cooking time was only about 15 mins at most, as I was cooking other things in the oven too, so wasnt watching the time.  My family of 9, was quite pleased!!  will definately do it again!

Delicious flavor - but I could not get the results of the bacon being safely cooked with the times listed in this recipe.  I had my oven at 400 degrees and had them in for a total of 14 minutes and they were still not cooked to a safe level.  I decided to fry up the rest of the package - and then threw the sugared ones in that had already been partially baked.  I was able to drain them on a paper towel.  The flavor was wonderful - but would like to try them without the extra fat I had to fry them in.  I will try again eventually - but will use a deep roasting pan with handles and a metal wire cooling rack within - so I can easily get it in and out of the oven.  Also - looks like I will have to bake them for much longer.....but I can't recommend this recipe because I don't think the bacon is cooked to a safe temperature as written.  I will also use my convection setting to see if that helps.

I cut the bacon into 1-2 inch pieces, dip each piece into maple syrup, and THEN into the brown sugar mixture.  I also use nutmeg in place of cinnamon, and add a pinch of cayenne pepper for that awesome mix of sweet and hot that my family loves.  This is our favorite Super Bowl snack.

Good Bacon but I would use crunched up tin foil to line the baking sheet (it helps with clean up) also you can mix the cinnamon and brown sugar in a plastic quart bag to help with clean up....I rolled the bacon up while still hot with a fork and added chocolate on top and it was awesome....:)

After reading some of the reviews and finding some concern if the bacon is thoroughly cooked or not I wanted to come on here and say that I think the bacon is cooked just enough and it's the syrupiness that keeps the bacon from getting the desired texture, but then I noticed the pic submitted by Muse and see that the bacon is charred a bit.  I think I'll be leaving my bacon in a little bit longer.  :)

I have made this at the holidays for years.  We always knew this as Pig Candy.  I add a little paprika to the sugar.  Gives it a little kick and cuts the sweet as well.  My extended family loves it and asks for it every year at Christmas and New Years parties.  Trouble is once you start making it you will be in the kitchen all night.  It disappears as soon as you put it on the plate.  Thanks for sharing Muse.

The way I made it, it came out a bit safe for our tastes. Next time I will use less sugar, more cinnamon and foil on the pan. Hope to upgrae this to a four star once I do that :)

OMGosh!! Made two pounds and it was a hit!!!  It was difficult determining cook time but prep was easy. Next time I will drain off the fat as the bacon is baking to see if it helps with cook time and crispiness (8 minutes definitely not -needs longer.)-I used the twist method mentioned in another review and it worked great.

This was not my idea of bacon.  It was sticky, way too sweet and tough.  I'll stay with the natural flavor.

When my family eats bacon (usually camping or Father's Day) this is how we make it, always a hit and others think we are genius'.  We pan fry the bacon until almost done, then sprinkle the top with brown sugar, let the sugar melt and done. Yummy!!  I don't believe I've ever used more than 1/2 c brown sugar for 1 lb - sounds like a lot of sugar!?  I haven't tried adding cinnamon, excited to try that this summer!! Thanks!

One reviewer noted the difficulty draining the bacon on paper towels.This idea helps. I put the bacon on a baking sheet lined with foil. Then sprinkled the brown sugar and cinnamon ONLY on the TOP side of the bacon. When it gets done you can then lift the bacon off and onto paper towels to drain. Make sure its the underneath side of the bacon that DID NOT get the sugar and cinnamon. That way you get rid of some of the fat and grease and still tastes just as yummy!!! And also I didn't measure anything . I just sprinkled ingredients on and coooked til my desired doneness. B/C of changes I made, I will give 4 stars.

Couldn't get the crispness that I expected.  The flavor was great, especially after I sprinkled it with cracked pepper.  I wonder if the oven temperature as well as the amount of fat on the bacon contributed to the lack of crispness.  Jeanie Bean

The only thing I disagree with in this recipe is the 8 minutes cooking time. I used thick sliced bacon and had to cook it 20 minutes (kept flipping every 4-5 minutes). Even at that I probably could have cooked it a few more minutes longer... but I was afraid the sugar would burn.

I loved this recipe.  The salty, smoky flavor of bacon with the sweetness of the brown sugar and cinnamon was great.  Definitely will make this again.

I turned the oven up to 400F and just kept an eye on it. The sweeter flavor is a good change, but the big thing I noticed is the texture. It's not crumbly, just more chewy. I did try adding the dry mustard as someone mentioned, but didn't notice any big flavor change. Pretty good!

Absolutely delicious!  As per other reviews, I baked at 400 degrees for 11 minutes.  USE TIN FOIL!
Made this again and this time I placed bacon on tin foiled pan, sprinkled with brown sugar on both sides, baked 6 minutes on one side and 5 minutes on other side. Sometimes I use cinnamon, sometimes I don't.

it was good but i prefer cooking on stove top. If you choose to do it this way, cook bacon without sugar until half-way cooked. Once half cooked, sprinkle brown sugar evenly over your bacon. (this recipe calls for too much sugar, cut it in half) Cook until crispy and enjoy.

Cooked the bacon for 10 - 12 minutes and instead of the cinnamon I added cayenne pepper. Sweet and spicy with the salt in the bacon is fantastic!

I've made this several times now and it always turns out great - no changes to the recipe.  I use light brown sugar and thick cut bacon and have no trouble with it, other than it sometimes needs a smidge more time to cook.  I do cut my bacon in half lengthwise - easier to fit into the pan and makes more treats.  :-)

In order to cut down a bit on cleanup, I have found that lining a roasting pan first with foil, then putting down a Silpat silicone mat helps (especially if you want to try rolling the bacon into twists to keep more of that sugary goodness inside).  
However, my favorite way to make this is by using my el-cheapo Ikea roasting pan with the wire rack inside.  I line the roasting pan with 2 sheets of foil, running the foil an inch or two up each of the sides of the pan.  I cook the bacon, then remove it to cool on freezer paper.   Let the pan sit for a good 10 - 15 minutes, then pull the rack out.  The sugar that's collected pools, then hardens, at the feet of the rack and pulls the foil out with it.  Pull the foil off, throw it out, toss the rack into the dishwasher and give the pan a quick swipe with a dishrag.   Easy cleanup.  :-)

I followed the directions exactly, except I baked at 400 and it still took 15 minutes.  I covered the pan with parchment paper, which worked really well.  I'm wasn't too crazy about the cinnamon though, and next time I will put less or try another reviewers suggest to use ground mustard powder instead.

There is no way this can cook in 8 minutes.  Definitely need to line pan with foil because it makes a royal mess of the baking pan.  It is quite tasty and is great with fried apples--but a lot of work and mess to get to the finished product

Our personal preferances & modifications: no cinnamon, use thick/extra-thick sliced bacon, & broil a few minutes at the end for better results.  This still isn't like what we get at our favorite Bed&Breakfast but it's sufficient for a little extra breakfast treat in between visits.

We didn't like this at all.  The bacon was very limp, under cooked and chewy tasting.  Maybe if you cooked the bacon first and then baked it in the sauce for a little while it would improve.  I won't try this again.
