What an excellent recipe!  I ended up changing it a bit though.  Here are my modifications:
1. First, I cooked garlic, shallots, mushrooms with the spinach.
2. Then I added feta cheese to the spinach mix.  If you add feta, remember to cut back a little on the amount of salt you put on the salmon because the feta is salty.
3. I used sun-dried tomatoes in oil.
4. I gave up on putting slits in the fillets.  Instead, I took two large but fairly flat salmon fillets, placed one on the bottom, put the spinach mix in the middle, and put the other fillet on top (thin end on top of the thick end).  I took string and tied the two fillets together, making a salmon parcel.  Due to the thickness of the parcel, I had to cook it longer in the oven.

As one reviewer already mentioned, the spinach really goes well with the salmon (for reasons only known to iron chefs).  Adding mushrooms will enhance the spinach even more.

Very tasty, my boyfriend loved it.  I made a few modifications...added extra pesto and sundried tomatoes, a few chopped mushrooms, and a little bit of feta, and used walnuts instead of pine nuts.  I also found that it took closer to 15 minutes for the salmon to cook through.  When I make this again I'll saute the spinach mixture before stuffing the salmon.  Even after baking the stuffing mixture didn't wilt...it was still sort of crunchy, and I felt like there was a salad stuffed inside my salmon.  I think it would also be a lot easier to stuff if the spinach was wilted beforehand. Taste was fantastic though.

This was absolutely delicious.  A drizzle of extra virgin olive oil over the top of the salmon filets before cooking makes it perfect.  Would make it over and over again!

AWESOME, but not just in fish.  Used it in salmon last night, excluding the pine nuts and adding some pesto to the top of the salmon.  Yummy!  Tonight, I took the suggestion to try the leftover amount in a boneless, skinless chicken breast (seasoned with sea salt, pepper, rosemary and poultry seasoning) and am now putting it on my list of personal favorites!  And it's so pretty, too!

As for slits:  I cut a "V" into the top of the filet, scooped out the excess salmon, and filled with the spinach/pesto mixture.  For added flavor, I sprinkled gorgonzola cheese on the top of the filets about 5 mins. before they were done.  
Fabulous dish & wonderful presentation!
I'll make again and again.
(p.s. The leftover salmon (cut from the filets, could be cooked and used the next day to make Red Pepper & Salmon Pasta - another 5* keeper!)

I really only used this recipe as a base, but what I ended up with was delicious. I used homemade pesto, made with just fresh basil, garlic, olive oil, and sea salt; I omitted the pine nuts; and I brushed the salmon with a shallot and dijon vinaigrette. Also, I didn't measure anything, I just mixed everything up till it tasted right. The flavors complemented each other beautifully. My only complaint is I wish I could have fit more stuffing into the salmon, because it tasted so good!

Delicious recipe - I didn't have sun dried tomatoes, so I used fresh and it came out wonderful. I liked that it only took a few minutes to prepare, too.

I made this the other day and it turned out great.  I added a little feta cheese, and extra sundried tomatoes packed in oil.  I used about a 2 1/2 lb filet, cooked the spinach, then mixed everything together.  I lined my baking dish with parchment paper, layed the mixture out on the parchment in a nice neat pile about the length of the filet, and layed the filet on top.  After it was done, I sliced the salmon in equal sized filets and carfully scooped each onto the serving platter (flipped over), so the spinach mixture ends up on top.  It turned out beautiful, and tasty!!  Thank you for the great recipe.

It was pretty good. The natural flavor of salmon was brought out by the spinach and pesto, though overall the flavor lacks punch. Instead of cutting slits in the salmon, I cut a slit clear through the side and stuffed the spinach so as to make a sort of salmon sandwich. If you do this though, don't use the broiler as the bottom layer of salmon will undercook; instead I would cook it in a regular oven setting at 400 for 15 or so minutes. Also I would add a bit of pesto on the top of the salmon, and use sundried tomatoes packed in oil for a bit more flavor.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I used sun-dried tomatoes that were soaked in oil and thought they worked great.  they gave the salmon a really good texture and next time i'll definetly add more of them.

This was good.  My husband suggested adding fresh cilantro for a little kick.  I will try that next time.

Excellent flavor and EASY to prepare although I found the amount of stuffing in this recipe was enough for 2 lb of salmon.

This recipe was great.  I used fresh baby spinach that I blanched first instead of frozen spinach though, gave it a brighter color and taste. I only prepared two fillets for myself and my husband and then the next day used the leftover spinach stuffing mixture to stuff two skinless, boneless chicken breasts.  After I stuffed the chicken breasts I sprinkled them with salt, pepper and olive oil, sauteed them on both sides in an ovenproof skilled then into a 350 degree oven for about 30 minutes.  Came out very good as well.

My first recipe from this website, fun (and a little messy!) to make, and it was delicious.  I added more pesto, and used marinated sun-dried tomatoes, because they didn't get quite soft enough during cooking.

I don't eat fish, but I made this for my boyfriend, and he rated it a 4.  I started by putting a little EVOO in a saute pan, and added some garlic.  Then I added the pesto and the oil packed sundried tomatoes.  Then I added the spinach and let it cook down.  It probably took about 10 minutes.  Then I put salt and pepper on the salmon, spooned the spinach mixture over the fillets, and baked as specified.  It smelled great, was very easy, and looked fantastic.  Definitely will make again!!

This is really an excellent recipe. I used a whole salmon filet, a 10 oz package of frozen chopped spinach, and put the spinach mixture on top (to save time for a weeknight meal). Not quite as pretty that way, but still absolutely delicious. My kids love it too, and it's an easy way to get them to eat veggies. Thanks so much for the great recipe!

Very good.  Impressed with how fast and tasty it was.  Added extra pesto, sun-dried tomatos, used soy nuts and drizzled EVOO on before baking.  Took longer than listed time, and seemed like a lot of filling, but still an excellent recipe.

I loved this recipe! Thought the flavor was excelent. I did however have to change a few things due to the contents of my frig. I cut thinly, half an onion and sauted it with 3 cloves of garlic. When that was finished, I added the spinach and then some roasted peppers as i did not have pesto or tomatoes. In the baking dish, instead of using cooking spray, added a few drops of olive oil and a splash of white wine, mixed it together and added the salmon and spinach filling. The salmon took longer than expected...about 20 minutes and at the end, i realized that where i had placed the spinach, it was not cooking through so i had to remove the spinach, let it cook a little longer and then put it back together on the plate....all in all a good staple recipe.

Fantastic recipe!  I wasn't able to cut a slit into the salmon successfully (I'll work on that next time), so I just topped the salmon with the mixture.  I made the pesto sauce, added the spinach and sundried tomatoes (packed in oil) to the pesto, then poured it on the salmon and broiled it. I left out the pine nuts and I don't think the dish lacked anything because of it.

Wonderful recipe, I use sundried tomatoes packed in oil instead of the dry packed, gave the "stuffing" a really nice flavor. One caution the fillets I used were very thick and took much longer to cook than the 8-10 minutes closer to 25 minutes. This is also good cold on sesame crackers would make a great appetizer.

This was pretty good. My fillets were very small and thin so I sauteed the spinach with some garlic and then stirred in the rest of the ingredients and seasoned the mixture with salt and pepper before I stuffed it into the salmon, which I also seasoned with salt and pepper and topped with a little shredded parmesan cheese.

I had no tomatoes on hand at all, so I cut up some red pepper in small rough squares, still fantastic!
To stuff the fillets, I found it a lot easier to stuff little by little and stretch the fish over the stuffing. I got so much spinach in that way! No left overs.

Excellent recipe! It's so delicious I used chopped walnuts instead of pine nuts because I didn't have them.  I also used the same stuffing for chicken and added feta. It was soooo good.

I was "hired" by my roomie to make this for his date, and until now didn't actually find the real recipe! I've fast tracked it and made this for several years with interestingly the same additions, as I see in the comments! Parmesan instead of feta if I lack the latter, a little lemon in the spinach, and forget slitting the salmon I say! I have a reliable marinade consisting of shallots/onions sauteed in butter, add white wine, dashes of tabasco, lemon, garlic, fresh ginger, s & p, tarragon, ... You're foodies! I'm sure you can figure out the proportions! I usually wing it depending on what I have. Boil it all, let it cool, marinate the fillets, and they will only take about 5 minutes to poach in the same marinade, as the lemon will have helped the process. I leave the skin in the pan and lay the fillet on top of the spinach and it's beautiful.  Thank you for this great recipe!

This is an absolutely wonderful and easy recipe.  Only thing I did different was to wilt the spinach before adding the remaining ingredients.  For my own taste I felt I needed a sauce to compliment this dish.  I used a very light cream cheese sauce with chopped chives sprinkled over top.  This is a divine recipe, probably my favorite of all salmon recipes and it is so easy to prepare.

We were very pleased with this salmon recipe. I did ballpark the mixture. I made my own pesto and used fresh spinach and tomatoes instead of sun-dried simply because that is what I had on hand. It was excellent as is, but I probably will try some variations like I've read in these reviews like adding garlic and mushroom to the mix, and olive oil on top to name a couple.

I really liked this with the added mushrooms, onions, garlic and feta cheese.  Next time I would add more feta cheese.

This was amazing.  My boyfriend is still talking about it!!!  I made some modifications but same basic concept.  Cooked the spinach a bit before hand, just to make sure it wasn't too crunchy.  Toasted the pine nuts and instead of sun dried tomatoes AND pesto, I just used a sun dried tomato pesto.  Also put a bit of olive oil on top, and when it was done cooking squeezed some fresh lemon juice on top, I think when you are cooking a fatty fish like salmon a little acid is always a good thing.  But like I said before, this was awesome!

I cook onions and garlic till lightly brown then set aside. Next, I cook down the spinach with some salt and pepper then toss in the onion and garlic mix at the end. Stuff the fish with ricotta or goat cheese and the spinach mixture. After stuffing the meat, sear and brown both sides first and then bake it. Trust me; it's worth the extra step. This is great with chicken breast or any other meaty fish.

I also had the problem of the spinach not cooking all the way, other than that it was great. I would recommend cooking the spinach partially first.

I thought this recipe was very good, but needed more of the ingredients listed.  I sauteed the spinach in about a teaspoon of oil and added the pesto, pine nuts and sun dried tomatoes to that, so it was warm when I stuffed the salmon.  I also added a clove of garlic and sauteed that with the spinach mixture, but I think it still needed another clove or two.  I also threw in some feta to the stuffing.  We liked it, but it was a little bland.  I added to the leftovers, and this made it superb.  I sauteed a couple more sun dried tomatoes with about another tablespoon of pine nuts, another clove of garlic and about a tablespoon more of pesto and put this on top and threw on some shredded parmesan before heating in the microwave, and the leftovers were superb!  I will definately make this again, but will be adding more of everything.

This was really good and so easy to make. I think it took a total of 30 minutes. I didn't have any sundried tomato or pine nuts, so I didn't use them. I sauteed a bit of chopped onion, garlic, mushrooms, chopped almonds and then added fresh spinach and a bit of salt, then added the pesto to this. I cooked the salmon about 15 minutes. Also added a bit of pesto to the top of each piece, as someone else suggested.

We didn't add the pine nuts or sundried tomatos, I thought this was redundant since the pesto we bought already had both and it saved a lot of money. But this was easy and excellent!

Just wonderful. had this for dinner last night and it was so easy. I cut all the way through the salmon and stuffed the filling inside and on the top. I didn't really track my measurements of things, but instead of pesto I just added some fresh frozen basil puree, and I used walnuts instead of pine nuts. I also used the tomatoes in oil as I had a big jar of them in the fridge.  This is one of my very favorite salmon recipes from this site.

I've made salmon with pesto many times before - this version with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes is yummy! It's lighter and tastes great. I split the salmon, but also put the remaining filling on top, and we didn't use any pine nuts.

Has an overpowering spinach flavor. Its a good idea to chop the sun-dried tomatoes in a small food processor to enhance their flavor throughout the spinach mixture. The pine nuts didn't seem to add much more than a slight crunch to the dish. I will make this again, but I will have to tweak it a bit for my taste.

I made the recipe with everything except for the pine nuts. Another person had mentioned to put the extra spinach on top of the salmon. I of course put it on while broiling it. This led to some of the spinach to burn. Luckily the rest of the recipe survived and was cooked to perfection. The ten minutes in the broiler was the perfect amount of time. I would definetly make this again but will not put the extra spinach on top of the salmon. Instead I'll probably use it as a salad which tastes great on its own.
 
Cheers,
Tyler

Healthy eating never tasted so good! I prepared this for dinner and my husband, teenaged daughter, sister and I loved it!  I used almonds instead of pine nuts (only because the store was out) and sprinkled lemon juice over the salmon after baking.  I followed the recipe as is and didn't experience any problems as some others have mentioned.  The time mentioned for baking was pretty much exact (my filets weren't very thick) and the spinach mixture was heated/cooked just enough to maintain the nutrients and taste.  My sister-in-law has already asked me for the recipe. This one is definitely a keeper!

I was a bit dissapointed with this receipe but I can't quite put my finger on why.  I had problems with the salmon tearing so most of the stuffing I just piled on top.  I used frozen spinach.  I may make this again but not in the near future.

I'm planning on making this again, but I'll either cook the spinach first, or use frozen spinach (thawed first and drained) for the stuffing. I'll also add some cheese, like Laughing Cow Light Garlic & Herb, or herby goat's cheese to counteract the dryness. The stuffing was overly bitter from roasting. So definitely give it a head start on the stove ahead of time or your salmon will be overdone before your spinach gets cooked.  (Or at least that's what I experienced).Overall, a good recipe, but not a great one.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because I didnt feel like the salmon was anything to rave about, just salmon and Im not a huge fan of cooked salmon however the stuffing was really good. I have actually been eating the stuffing like a salad and it is really good. I add a few extra sun dried tomatoes. Also the salmon needed to cook for longer than ten minutes.

I LOVE salmon!  I omitted the pesto and pine nuts (due to availability in my house).  I used the oil from the jar the sun-dried tomatoes came in to drizzle over the salmon before baking.  I had to increase the baking time though, 10 minutes was not enough.  Haven't met a Salmon I didn't like yet!

This salmon turned out to be the shizzy.  I modded it a lil' bit though: Mix in some herb goat cheese with the pesto and sun dried tomatoes.  Then, like another reviewer said, drizzled some olive oil on top and bottom before baking it.  Also, I cooked the spinach a little bit before stuffing, however, I don't think that is entirely necessary... Overall, very good will def. make that again.

What a great recipe. I did not stuff because my salmon was to thin. I cooked the salmon and then added the mixture to the top and put back in the oven to warm it all together. I added mushrooms, about triple the pesto, double the Sun dried tomato's and added a healthy serving of garlic. Even my son who "hates" salmon ate it with no complaints.

This is my favorite allrecipes.com recipe so far! I've made this a few times now and my husband and I both LOVE it! It's really easy to make, and it's just so darned good. I'll make this over and over again.

Very very good - but incredibly rich, I could only eat 1/2 my piece and I have a pretty good appetite!

Fantastic! My husband doesn't really like fish, and he had two servings of it! I'll definatly keep this one. Very flavourful and perfectly salty.

I'm not a big fan of salmon but this is delicious. I did saute the spinich, pesto, and (oil packed) sun dried tomatoes in a skillet with olive oil and minced garlic. The fillets were too thin to split so I just piled it on top, dolloped more pesto down the length of the fillet, sealed in heavy duty foil  (left open on the sides to let the smoky taste get in) and grilled for 20 minutes. Ummm Ummm GOOD!!

Pretty Good.  I left out the pesto (personal preference), and added extra sun-dried tomatoes.  It looked nice also.

This recipe was delicious.  I used almond slivers instead and it gave a nice crunchiness to it.  Also cooked the spinach first.

This was ok/good enough.  I think I prefer having salmon with seasoning only - the "old fashioned way".  But it still wasn't too bad.  I don't think I'll make it again.  The salmon took a lot longer to cook than stated in this recipe.

Awesome recipe & so easy to make! I didn't put in any nuts, but I added some fresh mozzarella to the stuffing mixture and it turned out wonderfully. Definitely a keeper.

Very nice... added fried onions on top of salmon... the filling had to much pesto for my taste though
