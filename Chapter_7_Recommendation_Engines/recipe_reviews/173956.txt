Awsome! We soaked the pheasant in buttermilk overnight to get rid of the gamey taste. Very good super bowl appetizer!

These are amazing!  I usually am not a big fan of game bird, but these are unbelievable!  We used pickled jalapenos (Mrs Renfros)  Amazing!  Highly recomended!

My husband just went on his annual pheasant hunting trip.  I threw this recipe in his bag, as it looked easy for a non-multitasking man.  He called me and said they were great, and were a huge hit with the guys.  They made them two nights in a row.  I can't wait to try them myself.  Thanks!!

Wow, these are great.  My husband hunts but I hate eating pheasant so we usually give it away.  This is the best pheasant dish I've had.  I took it to a NYE party and people really loved them!  I live in MN so grilling is tough in the winter...  I just baked them and they turned out perfect!

I loved this one, but husband though it was very spicy. I can do one of two things: Ignore him or put smaller pieces of jalepeno on each piece. Haven't decided yet....  Seriously, save this one, its worth it.

Took this to a christmas party and went over well, but I did do something a little different. Since my crew and I do not like things really hot and this was on the hot side. I added some teriyaki sauce to the poppers once they were cooked. It had a great flavor and still had enough heat.

This is the most I have ever enjoyed eating pheasant in my life.  I am not a big wild game person but these were amazing.  We have made them several times for family and friends and they are always well liked.  They are easy to make, in fact my 9 year old daughter has the recipe memorized.  She actually calls them "lizzy poppers" after whoever put the recipe up.  They are delicious and can be made in a snap...a definite 5 star appetizer.

These were surprisingly good.  We had to make a slight alteration as we only had 2 pheasant, so we threw in some grouse...kind of crazy, but the grouse was better.  It stayed tender and juicy while the pheasant was a bit drier.  Good recipe - we'll make it again.

This is a great recipe.  However I've added cream cheese in the mix and it really is outstanding with this addition.

Our family makes these all the time!! We maranate the pheasant over night in italian dressing, put them together and just through them under the broiler for about 5 minutes. This insures that the pheasant isn't over cooked and we like our bacon a little on the rare side. We don't have a family event without them!!

These were great! I am making them again tomorrow, my pheasant is soaking in milk to remove the gamey taste as we speak. Im thinking of making shish kabobs out of them this time for a meal instead of an appetizer. Also going to try the broiler as the grill is put away for the winter.

The best, and one of the easiest, pheasant recipe of all time. Just got back from a hunting trip and searched for a recipe. This was a huge hit with the entire family. Will use this time and time again. Thank You!!

This is great!  My neighbor always brings a similar appetizer to neighborhood parties, but made with duck.  This was a great hit at Thanksgiving.

I just made these yesterday for a Wild Game dinner, and they were a HUGE hit! They were the first to go off of the tables! I followed the recipe exactly and according to everyone's reviews at the dinner, there's no need to change a thing. Thanks!

We also brush it with some teriyaki sauce before grilling, which is awesome.  And you can make it with duck also.  Even people who "hate duck" will eat it.  Works well broiled in the oven too.

We first tasted this at our friends and have since made it many times.  It is always a huge hit and looks impressive.  It has great flavor and the jalapeno is not hot!  However we use fresh jalapenos not canned and make sure you use gloves when you cut the jalapenos or you will burn your hands.

We ate these as kabobs for the main meal so I diluted the jalapeno juice with water because I was afraid they would be too hot.  But, they weren't hot at all.  Next time I will use the full jalapeno juice.  My son, who totally refused to eat pheasant, agreed to try one after seeing them come off the grill and loved them.  He even "shotgunned" the leftovers for the next day.  I can't wait to try these again.

These are so good!  Be sure to use jarred jalopenos, not the canned ones for nachos.  We learned the hard way that those are way to big and much hotter!

All I can say is that I wish they had more stars for me to give!  These little things are amazing.  I also live in South Dakota and struggle with what to do with all of the pheasant that my husband brings home.  I found this recipe and not only is it very easy but these things are delicious!  I have made them a couple of different times now and they are a family favorite.  They have been a hit with anyone that I have ever served them too.  I have given out this recipe probably 15 times at least.  I recommend that everyone try these!  Even if you think that you don't like pheasant....you will love these. Trust me!  They are addicting.

I finally found a way to cook pheasant that I like, and come back for more.   I spread a little cream cheese on the end before eating to push the poppers into the "next dimension."  Pheasant season is over, so we'll have to make due with chicken poppers until next year.

Made this exactly as written and it was great! Served it to friends who aren't pheasant hunters or eaters and they loved it. I will definitely make this again!

Great the best way to make pheasant. I add a like Worcester sauce and brown sugar on them. Quality of bacon really makes  it better, I like the neater bacon.

Add a little piece of cheese (of your preference). If you want to, a pinch of garlic can also add some extra flavor to the bites. I make these every fall during pheasant season! One of the benefits of living in South Dakota! Next time I'm going to make these in my smoker, instead of the usual grill. I'll try to remember to update this comment with how it turned out!

These are so great! We've made them many times and they are always a huge hit. We can't ever make enough of them!

Be careful to get the bacon fully cooked!
