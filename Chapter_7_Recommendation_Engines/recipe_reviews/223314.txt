I used 3 tbsp smoked paprika instead of the liquid smoke because I didn t have any. I also added another 1/2 cup of ketchup to thicken it up a bit. Pretty good flavor.

I made it just like the recipe and its got a mighty kick. I love the flavor but a bit to spicy for some of the family. I would probably cut back on the chili powder and red pepper. Increase the molasses and brown sugar for a more sweeter kick. This will be my basis for many testing rounds!

Liked this barbecue sauce a lot. It was sticky and tangy but not overly sweet. Matter-of-fact not sweet enough. If I make it again I will add more brown sugar. Good basic recipe.
