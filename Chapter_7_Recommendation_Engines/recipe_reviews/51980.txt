Boy this brings back childhood memories! This sandwich reminds me of my late Grandpa Tom so I just had to make it.  He always planted  tomatoes in his garden and used to make this for me when I was a kid. We never used lettuce and always topped it with salt, pepper and plenty of mayo. He'd enjoy his with an ice cold beer and I'd enjoy mine with a tall glass of Kool Aid. This definitely is the classic gardener's relaxing meal as the submitter states. Sometimes the simplest things in life are the best.

I have always made this! And I love it! I only do one thing different. I use mayo instead of the butter. Very yummy! And very quick to make!

Well there's nothing better on a hot summer day. But I have to say, a tomato sandwich without MAYO might as well stay home. I give you credit for listing a common gardner's summertime treat! YUMMY.

I usually don't toast the bread, but do add lots of mao, salt and pepper. In addition, I always sliced a hard boiled egg on top.A slice or two of bacon never hurts.

This is absolutely divine! Not only is it good with tomatoes, something I don't even like all that much, but it's also wonderful if you omit the tomatoes altogether and substitute them with sliced bell peppers, (color of your choice), and just a bit of mustard along with the butter on the toasted bread, and a thick slab of swiss cheese. It's wonderful on a warm night, watching the sunset in swirling gold with an enormous jar of sweet tea between you and a loved one.  Thanks so much. t.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars if it had used mayo instead of butter!  My daddy used to make these for me as a kid and he called them toast and tomato's.  My all-time favorite sandwich!

The simplest sandwich is so true!  Many smiles here for the reminder in all the recipes we search for and try, often the "yummiest" is the simple one from our past.  :O)  Prepared as suggested or stripped down to just buttered white bead, fresh from the garden tomato, salt and pepper and you can't go wrong.  Course, for added zip, toast and miracle whip will hit the spot ... and leave you wishing you had just one more half.  Thanks for stirring up the memories!

I've eaten this sandwich my whole life.  I do use sharp cheddar cheese instead and add pickle.  I usually hate it when people give a recipe five stars but then say they make a bunch of modifications.  However, since I was born and raised and still live in Kansas, I figured it would be okay in this instance!  :)

This is a good simple sandwich. I have been making a similar one for years but use whole wheat bread plus a few thin slices of red onion.   Lots of possibilities here.   Thanks - it is nice that something so simple can be good.

Don't knock it until you've tried it.  This little beauty is as tasty as they come, especially when using fresh garden tomatoes. Be sure to slice your tomato thick.  I like mine at about 3/4 of an inch.

My grandmother used to make these for me 60 years ago, and always with mayo. Hers was homemade. I now fix them on homemade bread from my bread machine. It's the "Best Bread for Your Bread Machine" recipe, but I substitute some whole wheat flour for white, and add minced garlic, rosemary and bsil. YUM

In the interest of reducing our calories/fat intake, my hubby & I have found that replacing the mayo or butter with a "sandwich sliced dill pickle" works wonders.  Now that (with pepper jack cheese) makes a PERFECT tomato sandwich!! Try it before you turn up your nose ;)

Huge summer treat for us in this house. I use whole grain bread, mayonnaise instead of butter and sharp cheddar instead of American cheese. Grandma always taught me to salt the thick slices of tomato and set them to drain a little on paper towels before making your sandwich. Toasted bread is absolutely necessary for us.

I love, love, love a toasted tomato sandwich on rye toast. Try it with real butter instead of the mayo or Miracle Whip, it is REALLY good, yummy rich taste, that lets the garden fresh taste of the tomatoes shine through. And I love it when people submit recipes that are so basic and easy that most of us don't think to submit them. But for newby/young cooks this might just be the recipe that tweaks their interest and gets them started on a lifetime of checking "allrecipes" for wonderful recipes to try! Thank you so much for submitting, it's the simple things in life that are the best!

An old time favorite! A great way to use up some of those tomatoes out of the garden. I do prefer using mayo over the butter, though.

My fiance and I loved it. I added some dressing (sun-dried tomato and ranch) and used cheddar cheese. I didn't have lettuce, didn't use butter and used whole wheat french bread. This is my number one favorite lunch to eat at school! Thanks for the amazing recipe!

After reading the reviews and the recipe I was interested whether the butter really made a difference in the taste of the sandwich.  It did not.  I only had wheat bread and cheddar cheese so that is what I used.  Instead of using mayo, it would really enhance the flavor the the sandwich to use ranch dressing.

Toasted bread of any kind, thick slices of Michigan tomatoes, salt, pepper and miracle whip or mayol  YUM YUM.   I grew up on these sandwiches every summer when we wanted a snack but didn't have much food in the house.  We had a famil of 11 children, so that was often.

5 stars but has to be with Mayo. All the reviews talk about Mayo! Even better is with Multigrain bread lightly toasted.  I like to use the round Multigrain Sandwich Thins lightly toasted, mayo and a nice big Beef Steak Tomato slice. It fits perfect on the Sandwich Thins. Add a little salt and pepper and any cheese you like...and if you don't have any cheese, just skip it....it's a yummy Tomato Sandwich!

Made this for a snack at work, and it was so easy and sooo good. I used garden fresh tomatoes from a friend at work!

So much better with a slice of Swiss cheese, I dislike processed American cheese, just tastes like wax nor is 2% cheese really cheese.  I agree with all that added mayo, it is a must.  You also need good bread.

I feel silly for having high hopes for this recipe.  I know how to read ingredients and I'm not sure why I thought they would magically turn into something special.  Which, um, they didn't.  But, I appreciate the posting, and for the reminder that a tomato sandwich was my mother's favorite food in the world.  (She a great cook, and may she rest in peace.)  Thanks!

I laughed when I saw this recipe; I've been eating these for years. I've always called these the "World's Finest Sandwich". They are really only superb if you have fresh, homegrown tomatoes. I don't usually toast my bread, but I can see the benefit. As I am a Weight Watchers member and points conscious, I use Hellman's mayo made with olive oil, 2% cheddar or pepper jack cheese, and whole grain bread. Very little difference in flavor.

This sandwich is great any time, but especially this time of year, when the tomatoes are coming fresh from the garden! We have been enjoying these for years. Sometimes I add lettuce, but usually not. Hubby likes his just as is, with the butter, but I like mine with mayo instead. Either way this is a simple, ecomonic and tasty sandwich! :)

this is a great sandwich. I grew up on tomato sanwiches. We made them on untoasted bread. Instead of thick slices we used layers of thin slices of tomato to get more juice and used mayo no butter, no lettuce, no cheese. Stripped down and fantastic. Isn't it wonderful that such a simple thing can be made so many ways to please every taste?

One of my all-time favorite, refreshing summer sandwiches since I was a kid growing up in London!  My Mum just added sliced fresh cucumbers to round out the flavor and to add just a little crunch!  Delicious!

Pure Heaven.  Kansas tomatoes are hard to beat - throw some bacon and mayo on them and they are IMPOSSIBLE to beat! We can't toast the bread fast enough.

This sandwich is the exact sandwich I made 30 plus years ago – the night before I went into labor.  It brings back so many memories.  Thank you for publishing it.  It was wickedly delish that night. Because I had been on bed rest for almost two months and was able, finally, get up and do things for myself.  I snuck out of bed after everyone was asleep and made this sandwich with a vine ripe Kansas City tomato from our garden. Eight hours later, I actually lied and told the nurses I hadn’t had anything to eat since supper!! I have never told anyone about this until today! :-D

Toast two slices of wheat bread, top with a thick slice of tomato, then a slice of pepperjack cheese.  Place under broiler to melt cheese a bit, top with lettuce.  Add mayonnaise to top sliceof bread, put sandwich together and enjoy - with that glass of iced tea. Both ways delicious!

I actually made it in a pita with provolone cheese... put in some italian seasoning too! I toasted the entire thing in my sandwich toaster until cheese melted and the flavor reminded me of those tomato cheese pizzas! totally easy and yummy.

This sandwich is good but I have to say that usually make mine with toasted white bread, 2 slices of american cheese and I use Miracle Whip with mine instead of butter and it's the best! I also do not add lettuce or salt. Just my preference. Yummy.

I make these sandwiches all the time. I swap mayo for the butter and sharp cheddar for the american cheese. I normally add a slice or two of bacon also. They're a perfect summertime lunch.

There is nothing better than a tomato sandwich for lunch, and this was delicious.  I used low-cal oatmeal bread and omitted the butter.  The romaine lettuce leaf was perfect.  A quick sandwich that I know I will be enjoying again.

i've made this sandwich for years! Best with mayonnaise, good bread like sourdough, colby-jack or aged provolone cheese, and ONION! A summer classic and so easy! Only four stars because I think my changes make it five stars.

This is summer on a plate.  I always use butter, please no mayo!  I have also started to use the new sandwich thin buns.  Yum!  Probably don't need a recipe for this but it is a good reminder of one more way to eat those delicious fresh tomatoes.

I think this should be called the All-American sandwich!  Just needs mayo and it would be perfect!  Toasted or untoasted, white or wheat bread, with or without cheese...with fresh summer tomatoes, still warm from the garden sun, YUM!!  Something to dream about all winter long!

This sandwich with a couple tweeks, takes me back to my childhood summer days and I have to have several during the tomato season now.  I use fresh wheat bread, not toasted with lots of miracle whip and salt and pepper.  Soooo yummy! thanks for the memories!

Followed a reviewers suggestion and used mayo instead of butter. Also added onion and used provolone cheese instead of American. Loved it!! Will definitely make it again.

YUM!!!!  This was so good!  I used homemade bread and real cheddar cheese (hate the fake stuff).  I thought it would taste weird because I usually put salad dressing instead of butter and I never toast the bread, but this is the way I'm going to eat tomato sandwiches from now on.

Hey, this is a Pennsylvania born tomato sandwich!  The tomato gotta be a beefsteak, cut at least 3/8" thick with one slice out of the tomato's middle to cover the bread!  Forget the cheese and cover with mayo or sandwich spread!

Followed recipe exactly.  Toasted with the butter makes it really yummy.

I love these sandwiches.  Except I usually use mayo instead of butter and don't toast the bread but have when the mood stricks.  My husband thinks I am weird but this just proves I am not!

I make these all the time.  It is great both toasted or non, however rather than butter (and the much suggested mayo) I use calorie wise ranch dressing for a bit of flavour!

Okay, a lot of reviewers have said use mayo instead of butter...here is the difference:  if you don't have garden fresh beefsteak tomatoes, then you better use mayo or ranch dressing. But if your tomatoes are fresh picked, thick sliced, lightly salted beefy tomatoes, it doesn't matter what you put on the bread...it will be the BEST sandwich ever!
