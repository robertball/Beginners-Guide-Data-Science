Good recipe, but if you're craving real tiramisu, THIS IS NOT THE RECIPE FOR YOU!  I made some substitutions that I think made it taste a little better - it is a yummy recipe, but just not what I was expecting.  I used ladyfingers instead of vanilla wafers, real coffee instead of Maxwell House (sorry Maxwell lover), and next time I'd use coffee liquer instead. I also used real whipped cream rather than Cool Whip.  Overall, tasted yummy but more of a trifle than Tiramisu.
