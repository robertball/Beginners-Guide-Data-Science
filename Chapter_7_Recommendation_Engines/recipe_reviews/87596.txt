Great recipe, made a few changes though. I added a cup or so of diced cucumber, as well as a couple cups of broccoli, I poured the hot pasta water over the broccoli to steam... rinsed all in cold water to keep from overcooking pasta and broccoli.  Also I added quite a bit less oregano and added in a few TBS of balsamic vinegar to increase the flavor, overall great recipe and delicious summer salad~

Leaving town again so it's time to clean out the fridge again too, which Hub's staff always appreciates. This salad did a good job of clearing out the vegetable crisper - I added all ingredients to taste and came up with a winner.  I appreciate this recipe for the fact it doesn't call for bottled Italian dressing which makes this salad better than those right from the start.  I used fresh garlic rather than the jarred and added black olives as well as orange and yellow bell peppers. I also gave it a splash of white wine vinegar.  Finally, I wanted something a little smaller than rigatoni so I chose to use penne pasta instead.  This is such a great combination of flavors - the olive oil, cheeses and fresh herbs realy make this salad exceptionally good.  I think it would be impossible for this to turn out badly.

VERY tasty! I tool this to a BBQ and everyone LOVED it!!   I made it as written and added the juice of one lemon, and a quarter cup of balsamic vinegar. Next time I will also add extra garlic. It was very tasty, but in my opinion needed the lemon and vinegar as without it I found it a tad bit bland.

Great way to use a lot of vegetables.  I included the peppers and tomatoes and added zucchini, cucumbers and a little carrot for color with tri-color bowtie pasta.  It really soaked up the olive oil, so add a little more before serving.  Great left overs too!

Delicious.  My husband loved it, and he usually isnt a huge fan of pasta salads.  I didnt put quite as much bell pepper, and oregano to taste.  Will make this again.

Loved this one - Family & friends demand this one for BBQ's and lunch when they are around. I did add extra garlic & doubled all the other add-ins (eg: cheeses, cherry tomato etc) to give more body & flavour but hey it is a wiiner.

This is good, but it needs a little something to add a zip. I splashed some balsalmic vinegar to taste and that made all the difference.

I was happy with how this recipe turned out.  I substituted Italian seasoning for the oregano and didn't use as much as stated - just until it was covered well.  I also used orange, green and red bell peppers for extra color.

Great basic recipe!  Gave it 4 stars because I felt it really needed vinegar. I added balsamic. Made this last-minute with what I had on hand.  I had lots fresh basil and roma tomatoes from the garden.  I also tossed in some carrots and black olives.  Used parmesan and shredded mozzarella as I didn't have Asiago. Great way to use just about any veggies you have on hand!

I added 1 shredded zucchini, mozzarella also shredded instead of the cheese listed. I used much less oil and left out the parsley. It came out really good we will take it to a beach picnic.

Absolutely delicious and light pasta salad. I used about half the recommended amount of each cheese and didn't miss it at all.

Using fresh herbs is what caught my attention with this recipe. I did feel after a taste test that it needed some vinegar, so added in a few generous shakes of white wine vinegar, much better. I grated the cheeses and they were a wonderful addition. I do think some onion and black olives would really take this over the top. Great salad and we enjoyed it.
