I grabbed this recipe a few months ago and make it at least once or twice a month. I was looking for something close to what is served at the wonderful Chinese restaurant my husband and I have been going to on date night since our first date and this is pretty close!  :-) 

I use two chicken breasts cut into very small pieces (instead of the pork), coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and increase the sauce proportions (1.5 to double depending on the size of the chicken breasts). 

Chef Rita hit it -- the blistering of the beans is the key and the sauce is super yummy. It's a huge hit any time I make this!

This is a GREAT dish!  I adjusted a few ingredients to my taste.  I used 6 cloves of garlic I minced(not minced from a jar, ever), 4 green onions, an additional tsp. fresh ginger, and a 1/2 tsp of dry crushed red pepper...also I used twice the amount of soy sauce(low sodium).  I prepared the ingredients beforehand and put them each in a small bowl and first time I made the spicy beans  served them over brown rice....if you want the"sauce" to be "soupier", add a bit more water....I forgot that I also added a tsp of sugar as well!  LOVE this...might try it next time with ground turkey or chicken!!!  Definitely a main dish...but key is ONLY fresh spices and good quality ingredients...garlic chili pastes come in a huge variety at a higher end grocery...don't have to shop at a specialty Asian store.

This has been sitting in my box for a long time.  This is a very good and easy to make recipe.  Next time I'm going to up the spices just a bit and maybe add some hoisen sauce.  I will make this again and this would be a good busy dinner night meal.  I served over brown rice.  The other thing that is great about this recipe is that it didn't require me to buy any additional spice ingredients.  Thanks for sharing.

Even though this wasn't exactly the recipe I wanted, it was excellent! Frying the beans in oil first made them crunchy and juicy. My husband and 14 year-old son loved it!I made this as a side dish, so there was too much pork. Thanks!

This is amazing.  Restaurant quality.  (I doubled the amount of pork though, and used a full pound.)

Delicious and pretty easy.  Make sure you use fresh green beans, I tried thawed frozen ones and they didn't get crisp.  Great spicy asian flavor.

Great recipe, for added asian flavor try a tsp. or two of sesame oil added to your veg. oil.  Fast and easy, and delicious.  Always a hit with my family. Peeled diced eggplant can be substituted for the green beans, or added along with them--tastes super, just increase the sauce.

It is pretty easy to make but all I taste is the spiciness, next time will have to use less chili sauce and up the other flavors.

I read some of the reviews before cooking and was worried about the amount of heat...but 2 Tbsp was almost not enough!  It had a great flavor, loved the crispy beans!  The only change I made was increased the chicken broth to 1 cup and mixed the corn starch with the broth as well.  This made for a little bit of a saucier dish that we served over fried rice!  We would make this again!!!

I cut hot sauce in half and used chicken (coated in corn starch to keep it most). It was fantastic! Ate with rice cauliflower for low carb.  (For my kids I would use a quarter of it.)

We loved it!  Very fragrant and flavorful.  The only thing we didn't do is fry the beans, instead, we blanched them.  I had to adjust the hear level because of our daughter. Also, we found it a little salty, so either cut down the soy sauce or use low sodium soy sauce.

The sauce was tasty but didn't really go well with the green beans.

Delicious.  Used 1 Tbsp of chili sauce and that was plenty for us.
