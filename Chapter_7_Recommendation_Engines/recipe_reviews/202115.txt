Loved it, thanks for the great idea! I used lemon dill starkist tuna and roasted pine nut hummus. I didn't need to add anything else, it was delicious.

THe red pepper hummus is an inspired idea.  I liked Darlene's additions, too and will use them when I make this filling again.  I'm always on the lookout for new ideas for the good ol' tasty tuna sandwich.  Thanks Darlene and thanks for the recipe.

This was great! I love how healthy this is without tasting like it is. The only change I made was using dried herbs because I didn't have any fresh. I will definitely make this again. I served it in pitas with green bell pepper slices and it was one of my favorite lunches I have taken to work. Thanks for sharing- I would never have thought to use hummus with tuna!

It's as good as regular tuna salad. Possibly better. Certainly better if I'd followed the submitter's recommendation in the description to serve it with melted Cheddar on top, which I did get the go-ahead from the husband to try it that way next time :) Thanks for the recipe--I LOATHE mayonnaise and had been wishing for a way to eat tuna, as it's such an easy & inexpensive way to get a serving of fish in! (Made with 2 tbsp. of "Authentic Kicked-Up Syrian Hummus" from this site.)

I think I just died and gone to heaven. I almost want to cry tears of happiness because of this recipe. I'm allergic to mayonnaise and don't even like it to begin with, and I've been eating my sandwiches with mustard for years. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE mustard, but the hummus adds that "creamy" consistency a true tuna sandwich should possess. THANK YOU SO MUCH, "A Turtle in the Kitchen!" You have made more than my day.

This is a GREAT alternative your typical mayo-ridden tuna. I used regular hummus since I didn't have any of the red pepper hummus.  It was still fantastic! The spices give the tuna a great Mediterranean flavor.  This is by far the best non-mayo tuna recipe I've ever tried!  Thanks!!!

I doubled this recipe bc I was hungry.  I made my own hummus from the Easy Hummus recipe on here, so I didn't have roasted red pepper hummus.  Instead, I diced fresh red peppers and celery to put in.  We don't eat raw onions, so I left those out and made a tuna melt out of this.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was absolutely great.   Didn't have the pepper so I added some diced celery.  Nice flavor and much more healthy than using mayo.  Thanks

Maybe it is just me, but I think the tuna was too dry with only 2 tbsp hummus-- so I practically quadrupled it.  My chili pepper was of poor quality-- which I wasn't aware of until I started preparing everything.  Next time I will be using marinated/canned chili pepper instead.  Thanks for the recipe!

I make this wonderful recipe a couple of times a week. The only thing I change is to omit the chili pepper and use a few shakes of Trader Joe's 21 seasoning salute. Then I pile the filling on a whole grain sandwich thin and melt muenster cheese on top under the broiler. This is my favorite way to enjoy tuna.

Fantastic twist on a classic!  I used roasted garlic hummus as that was all I had, added some chopped celery and used half a diced jalapeno as I didn't have a green chile.  I wasn't too keen on the sound of the rosemary, so opted just for oregano, which was dried as I didn't have fresh.  Super yummy...great idea, never would have thought of this.  This will likely be my go to for my tuna sandwiches now, hubby and I both loved it!

This was really simple and yummy.  I only had garlic hummus and a green pepper, whole grain bread.  Good and healthy. Crunchy with the pepper. Awesome!  This recipe is a keeper!!!

Well, I have to admit, I was very skeptical about this recipe.  While I like all the ingredients individually, I couldn't imagine them together.  But I liked it!  And a bonus is that it is 3 PointsPlus per serving on my Weight Watchers eating plan.

Excellent substitution for mayo. Pleasantly surprised, though I used plain hummus. I disliked it when I ate it out of the bowl, but on bread with mustard it was awesome.

This was really tasty! I made it as written and was really pleasantly surprised at how well the flavors blended - there wasn't one flavor that was overpowering. I did make this the night before I ate it, so maybe that helped the flavors all blend. Will definitely be making it again!

What a great idea!  I used a can of tuna, red pepper hummus, diced celery, diced roma tomato, oregano, and pepper.  I drained the tuna and it seemed a little dry so I added the middle of the tomato.  I ate it with Sesame Tarragon crackers made by back to nature.  Totally works!

Wow, this was absolutely amazing.  I've always wanted to eat tuna salad, but never could because I cannot stand mayo... Maybe not the flavor, I'm not sure.  Just the concept of mayo makes me sick.    This is an absolute gem.  I made this without modifications except I had to use dried versions of the herbs instead of fresh.  I will be making this on a regular basis as it is a very healthy option for me and easy to take to work.

We were out of mayo, but wanted tuna salad for sandwiches - after trying this recipe, I will NEVER use mayo again in my tuna salad!  The only changes I made (completely out of necessity because we were missing some ingredients) were using white onion instead of red, basil instead of rosemary and celery instead of peppers.  I also had some capers on hand that I threw in.  We served it on 12 grain bread, open-face with a slice of tomato and cheddar, melted in the toaster.  Thanks so much for this healthy, filling and tasty recipe!

I love it.  You can substitute the red pepper hummus with chipotle hummus. It gives it more bite.

It was excellent. I'd do 3 tbs of hummus next time because it wasn't a very strong taste. I left out the onion and peppers as I didn't have any. So healthy and so quick and easy to make! My 9yr old wanted seconds.

This was so good!  I would have never thought to put oregano and rosemary in tuna, but I absolutely loved it! Of course, I did make a few minor changes....I used Hummus III from AllRecipes.com (lemony and delicious); dried oregano since I didn't have fresh; Mezzetta hot chili peppers with a splash of the brine; a little bit of mayo because it was kind of dry; and a dash of lemon pepper. I served it open faced on a toasted Rosemary & Olive Oil Foldit Flatbread, with spring mix on top.  A very adaptable recipe for personal tastes and what you have on hand. I will definitely be making this again!

I used shallot instead of onion and toasted the pita in the toaster over after I filled it which gave a nice crunch. I hate mayo and have eaten DRY tuna salads up until now, never again! I made an arugula and spring green salad tossed in handmade tahini and lemon dressing and topped with pine nuts to complete the meal

I loved this!! It might sound strange but I added Dijon mustard, celery, green peppers, curry powder, apples and walnuts to this - skipped the rosemary- and it turned out amazing!Worked really well combining ingredients from other recipes to this one. Great no-mayo base recipe!

Great alternative for mayonnaise. This was a healthy, light recipe.

This is an awesome recipe!  It was so refreshing and not at all heavy like regular tuna salad can be.  Even my 18 month-old loved it!

Super yummy! I added some green bell pepper instead of the chile pepper because I didn't have any. I also used garlic hummus instead of red pepper because that's what I had just bought at Lakewinds. It gave it just the right amount of garlic flavor. Very good on a dense piece of whole rye bread. Yummy!

Very good.  I like the hummus substitute for mayo a lot.  Great flavor, nice texture and healthy.

delicious! I never thought of mixing hummus with tuna...I had just made some homemade hummus and had the fresh herbs on hand - so tasty and healthy! I did skip the chile pepper and added a little celery for crunch.
