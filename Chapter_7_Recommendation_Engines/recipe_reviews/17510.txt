Excellent!  I used cranberries instead of blueberries and deleted the streusel.

One of the best muffins I've ever tasted.  Very sweet, though, so be ready for dessert.

These muffins weren't that great. They turned out heavy and dry, better as paperweights.  The next day they were hard as rocks.  They were pretty bland tasting as well. Won't make these again.

I felt this recipe was just ok.  I did make two changes.  I used chocolate chips instead of white chocolate chips and I used 2 cups of blueberries and only 1 cup of chips, due to all the comments about the white chocolate flavor overpowering the blueberries.  Oh, and I left the drizzle off the top, I agree that the streusel topping was enough - besides there was barely room in the muffin cups for another topping.  

Overall I felt the chocolate chips overwhelmed the flavor of the blueberries too.  However, my husband loved the muffins.

The batter was very sticky and a little hard to get into the cups.  Still the muffins were very good.  I would make them again with all blueberries.

There wasn't much of a blueberry flavor with all of the white chocolate.  Skipped the extra on top too.  My kids didn't eat them, but everyone at work thought they were great.

These are a nice variation of traditional Blueberry muffins.  But they are much sweeter than the original recipe.  Almost more of a dessert than a breakfast item.  The topping (white chips melted) was a messy task.  I will omit that step next time.

A good, rich muffin that those with a sweet tooth would love. However, i found that the white chocolate (even though i reduced the amount to half) tended to obscure the lovely blueberry muffin taste.

Excellent! Easy! I changed the recipe to 12 servings, recipe calls for 18 wish I would have made more. Two thumbs up from my 8 year old.
My husband loved them also. Will make again.

Delicious muffins!
I baked them twice, both times scaled to 12 servings, which made 6 jumbo-sized muffins. I omitted the melted white chocolate each time.
The first time I tried them (as is), the white chocolate chips overwhelmed the blueberries.

The second time (the rating is for the second time), I used only 1/2 cup white chocolate chips, and upped the blueberries to 1 1/2 cup (almost a pint). I also added in a chopped peach with the blueberries. this was the perfect balance of fruity and chocolately flavors for me. 

A shortcut to the streudal topping: Cut in cold butter to the flour/sugar mix (not with the rest of the liquide ingrediants). Set aside 1/2 a cup of the sugar/flour/butter mixture before adding the liquid ingrediants to the rest. Add an additional 1-2 tablespoons of cold butter, and sprinkle on top of muffins before putting in the oven.

This is really one of the best muffin recipes ever! I stumbled over it one time when I had loads of white chocolate chips and looked for new ways to use them. I like the recipe just the way it is, preferring fresh blueberries over the frozen kind, though. The modifications I just read in the other reviews sound good, too. I might try them. Yum yum. Wherever I bring these muffins people go crazy and I have to give out the recipe. I especially like the whiff of cinnamon in the streusel topping!They're just unbelievably good, try them!

These muffins are good but not great.  I omitted the glaze and streudel.  I used 1/2 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. white sugar.  Finally, I increased the blueberries to 2 c. and decreased the chips to 1 c.  The recipe fully filled 12 regular muffin cups, and they were light and fluffy.

These are the first "from scratch" muffins I have ever made.  They are delicious.  My husband even loves them.  I just gave up Chocolate Chocolate Chip muffins from the store because they have so much fat in them.  Hopefully these have less than 24 grams each.

I was surprised how much I liked these, although my kids were only so-so.  I was going to make regular blueberry muffins and saw this recipe and decided to give it a try.  Like many reviewers I cut down on the white chocolate, added only 1 cup, and didn't drizzle any on the top (would have been overkill).  I also substituted brown sugar for granulated sugar in the streusel - personal preference.  They were very moist and light.  The key is not to over mix your batter.  Gently mix your wet ingred. into your dry ingred., just until incorporated, then fold in chocolate and blueberries.  Sorry Nestle, I don't like your white chocolate morsels, instead chopped a bar of another brand that I prefer.

I modified this recipe, left off the streusel topping.....used one cup of blueberries, one cup of raspberries, and one cup of white chocolate morsels. I also left out the lemon peel. Absolutely LOVED these. They were soft and moist. They stayed soft and moist the next day, as well. Very nice flavour.

Dangerously good!  These muffins are more like a desert than a breakfast dish.  I skipped the melted white chocolate on top, they were already rich enough.  The light cake-like texture was wonderful.  Definately a must try for everyone!

These muffins were absolutely delicious!  I cut back the chips to 1 cup and decided not to drizzle any chocolate on top.  Also, I baked 6 jumbo muffins instead of 18.  A winner!

Very Tasty!!  I liked them when they were cooled just as much as warmed.  I highly recommend this recipe!

These are wonderful but I did cut back on the number of white choc. chips (thanks to the person who suggested this).  I would also highly recommend using muffin cups, as I had a lot of trouble getting the little buggers out of the pan.  That didn't hurt the taste however!!

These muffins were delicious, especially when served warm.
