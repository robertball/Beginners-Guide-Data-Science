This reminded me of a recipe I sometimes prepare on special occasions.  I added garlic, 1/4 cup minced onion, 1/4 grated parmesan cheese, some crushed rosemary and doubled the mushrooms.  One hour before serving I also added a 14oz can of quarted artichoke hearts.  Served over rice, it was delicious.

Pretty good!  I took note that other reviewers complained of it having too strong a wine flavor, or being too tangy, and with that in mind, I took the lid off the crockpot for the last half hour and turned it on high.  I think this allowed more of the alcohol to evaporate, and the resulting dish was milder than previous tastings during cooking. (It also thickened the sauce nicely.) The chicken was very tender, perfect!  I'd add more mushrooms next time.

WOW!  This turned out fantastic!  My husband is not a  huge chicken fan, but all I heard during dinner was Mmmmmmm, this is great!  I used frozen chicken breasts, substituted whole fresh mushrooms for the canned, and used white zinfandel wine (all we had in the house).  Definitely season the chicken with salt, pepper and paprika, still needed a little salt, but then we like things very well seasoned.  I served it over angel hair pasta, with garlic green beans.  Try this!

Don't usually like canned soup based recipes, but this was quite good.  I did brown the chicken and fresh mushrooms first, then deglazed the pan with the wine/chicken broth (I used broth).  Added some onion salt, and season salt & pepper.  Used the paprika on top at serving to add color.  Also used the mushroom soup w/ roasted garlic.  Served with rice & glazed carrots.  Whole family enjoyed it.

Thank you Judith for this wonderful, simple, easy and oh so tasty recipe.  My hubby just loved it and my picky eaters loved it as well.  We served it over  buttered/parsley noodles and it was a winner!  The only thing I did different was my chicken breasts were frozen(I forgot to take them out and thaw them) I placed them in the crock frozen and they cooked up just wonderful with no extra time needed to the cooking time.

My family raved about this chicken!  I substituted chicken broth for the wine, as we do not drink.  I served it over egg noodles. The chicken was tender enough to cut with a fork.  My kids had seconds and thirds.

Easy basic recipe, but one that needs some tweaking to achieve a fuller flavor.  Have made it several times and will continue to use the following method; browned the chicken in olive oil using a mixture of flour, garlic, seasoning salt, paprika, and onion powder to provide a richness to the sauce.  I believe this enhances the flavor that so many reviews find lacking. Used the Golden Mushroom soup mix with golden sherry in place of the wine (as that's all I had on hand) and poured over the layer of chicken and thinly sliced portabella mushrooms. Reduced the cooking time to accommodate browning the chicken.  Served over noodles for an easy, low stress dinner.  Perfect for the working mom!  Thanks Judith for the submission!  UPDATE:  Just 2 of us for dinner vs the whole "herd" so I had plenty of leftovers.  Had a "hmmmm"  moment and thought this might be good as chicken and dumplings.  So the next night I added chicken stock to the remaining gravy, made herb dumplings found on this site, brought the gravy and chicken to a slow rolling boil and added the dumplings to cook.  I can't even begin to tell you what a great use of leftovers this was.  Absolutely outstanding!

I made this for dinner one night when my two in-laws were visiting.  We all absolutely loved it.  I did a few things differently, such as, I used Campbells Cream of Mushroom With Roasted Garlic soup; added one cup of chicken broth to crock pot; I used 7 chicken thighs (skin removed) and browned them in some olive oil and garlic before placing them in the crock pot, and when I placed the chicken in the crock pot, I put thin slices of onion atop each of them.  I also added about 1/4 cup of cooking sherry.  I cooked it on "low" for 7 hours, but for the last half hour or so, I removed the cover and turned setting to "high".  I served the chicken and gravy over noodles.  The chicken was falling off the bone!  A truly excellent dish.

To make this an all in one dinner, I layered the chicken (which I chunked into bite sized pieces) in the bottom of my crockpot with half of a sliced onion, 4 ounces of chopped FRESH mushrooms, then covered it with the cream of mushroom soup and the white wine. Right before dinner, I stirred in 1 1/2 cups cooked broccoli, 2 cups cooked elbow macaroni, the sour cream and a good amount of fresh ground pepper. I didn't need the flour as the starch from the pasta thickened it up nicely. I'll make this again but I would add spices the second time around as it was a little bland. I would also double the mushrooms.

Absolutely delicious with a few additions. I put sliced onions on top of the chicken and a clove of minced garlic in the sauce. An hour before serving add a cup of frozen peas.

We were a little disappointed in this recipe. It was very quick to prepare aside from the normal time in the cooker and the chicken had the perfect consistency, but it had a funny taste. We enjoy dishes with wine in them and creamy sauces, however, this dish had a very sour taste to it. It wasn't a taste of the wine and our sour cream wasn't bad, but the combination in the slow cooker made an almost unbearably sour taste. Our daughter wouldn't even eat it complaining of the acrid taste.

This was outstanding!  Both my husband and I just loved it!  It was extremely easy to make and I even used frozen chicken breasts.  I reduced the sour cream to a 1/4 cup because we are not big fans of sour cream but even the 1/4 cup gave it an incredibly rich flavor.  I also used about 3/4 tsp. paprika which gave it a nice kick (we like spicy food).  We will definitely be making this one again and I will be passing this recipe on!  Thanks for a wonderful dish!  5 Stars!!

I followed this recipe exactly and was just a little disappointed that the sauce came out runny.  It pours over the chicken very thick, but does not hold the consistency.  I will make again, possibly with less wine and more flour to help thicken it up.  The taste was very good.  We served it over whole grain noodles.

I seldom use canned soup in anything, but I love this dish!  I use the roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup, fresh mushrooms sauteed in butter, 1/2 a cup or so of chopped onion and I quickly brown the chicken breasts (cooks faster if you do this).  Clean up is easier if you whisk all the sauce ingredients together in the crock pot and simply add the chicken. Garnish after plating with chopped fresh herbs (I use chives, thyme, or tarragon) and a sprinkle of paprika to improve the bland appearance.    Save the left over sauce!  I mix it with browned hamburger, some frozen peas and carrots and chopped fresh dill.  Serve over mashed potatoes for a super quick and delicious Shepard's Pie.

I have used this recipe for years, but discovered several years ago that it tastes better when you use Golden Cream of Mushroom soup instead of the plain mushroom soup.

Sour cream, milk, and cream cheese should NEVER be added until the last 30 minutes of cooking in a slow cooker. Otherwise, it curdles> I add the sour cream at the end.

This was a tasty quick-to-combine recipe the whole family enjoyed (incl. kids ages 18 mos, 7 & 11 yrs).  I lightened up the sauce by using 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup & light sour cream.  It appeared to separate a little after simmering, but took another reviewers suggestion and removed the lid for the last hour before eating and it thickened nicely.  Either way, the taste was very good.  We didn't find it too tangy or that the wine taste was too strong, only change I would make would be fresh mushrooms next time.  Served alongside mashed potatoes & green beans, usng the extra sauce as a gravy.  Will definitely make again!

This dish turned out great, but probably because of the changes I made.  I added about four ounces of cream cheese and YUMMY, it was so creamy and delicious after I tasted it with the cream cheese than when I taste-tested it beforehand!  I also added about 1/4 cup of Parmesan, a little garlic, some sun-dried tomatoes (mostly for color) and about 1 tablespoon of Orrington Farms chicken seasoning.  I didn't add the entire amount of white wine ... more like 1/4th cup than 1/2 cup.  I cut up the chicken into large chunks instead of putting the entire chicken breasts into the pot and served it over buttered noodles.  It was a hit!  The cream cheese made it go from good to WOW!!!

Made this as written and we both enjoyed it. You don't need a knife with this chicken. It was easily cut with a fork, tender and moist. I started this off with frozen breasts and left it on LOW for just a little bit over 7 hours. Will do this again!

A very tasty way to slow cook chicken! This was my first meal prepared in my new slow cooker, and I'm glad I chose it. I did follow some of the other reviews, and only cooked it for 6 hours. That seemed to be perfect. I also browned the chicken after seasoning it and added 3 cloves of fresh garlic. I used low fat sour cream (and cut it down to 1/2 cup) and that worked just fine. The sauce was great over rice as well.

Found this recipe in a freezer book I'm borrowing from the library. Followed the first reviewer's advice except I didn't add artichoke hearts or onions (but did add onion powder). The original recipe in the book uses fresh mushrooms and adds all of the ingredients together in a freezer bag (combining the sour cream and flour separately and then adding it to the bag) so I made two freezer meals of this and then made this in the crock pot for today. I lessened the wine to 1/3 of a cup and used frozen breasts. Thanks! It was really good and probably the best freezer meal I made!

This recipe is a favorite in my house.  Most of the time I am not organized enough to remember to use our slow cooker so we just cook it for an hour in the oven at 350.  We have tried it with white wine, but cooking sherry taste much better to us.  We double the liquid to have more sauce.  Sometimes I forget the flour and the sauce is really runny but that is the way my kids like it.

I didn't think the sauce was very tasty.  I expected a creamier sauce using the mushroom soup, but it really wasn't liquidy or creamy at all, just kind of sat atop the chicken. I don't think I'd make the same way again, not without significant changes at least.

Really delicious and easy.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and added 1/2 onion and 2 cloves of garlic.  The chicken only took about 4 hours to cook on low, so you may not want to let this cook away all day.

Having eaten in Paris and being a big fan of French cooking, my husband and I loved this recipe!  My daughter didn't appreciate the wine but then she does not like wine at the best of times.  For easy preparation and cooking this recipe is great.  I think next time I might try lightly browning the chicken first, as everything looked the same colour (chicken, sauce and rice), the only contrast being the vegetables.  But overall, trés fantastique!

Sorry, this recipe was a disappointment to us.  I found this recipe to be lacking in flavor, even after adding a bit of sherry, parmesan, and extra mushrooms.  The gravy looked curdled but I fixed that by whisking it smooth.  I really wanted to like this after reading all the flattering reviews, but would not make this again.

Surprisingly good considering that I don't like canned crm soup in my slow cooker recipes. I also added garlic powder, italian seasoniing & some Frenche's onions sprinkled on top. Cooked chx brst from frozen about 5.5 hrs on high.  Served over egg noodles... could have used a bit more sauce. Yummm!!!

I used a can of all natural low sodium cream of mushroom soup, a mix of sauteed fresh mushrooms, onion, fresh rosemary, and seasoned the chicken breasts liberally with freshly ground white pepper.  Served with a baked sweet potato and roasted brussel sprouts it was an easy and delicious busy day meal that I would make again.

While it was super easy to make, the convenience does not make up for the taste.  Also, it looks pretty gross.  I typically like to follow a recipe as-is first, and then determine what I can change about it to make it better.  In this case, I should have stuck to my gut and loaded it up with spices.  Way too tart, and the consistency of the sauce is completely unappetizing.  Not going to bother making it again.

The chicken breast came out really tender cooked on Low for 5-6 hours.  Even hubby who doesn't like my slow cooker chicken recipes because chicken turns out dry liked this one.

I did have to add a 1/4 cup parmesan cheese to this to make it to our liking.  When I tasted it 5 hours into cooking I thought it was really good because I love sour cream but also really bland.  The fresh parmesan did the trick.

Btw, I doubled the sauce because we love sauce around here.  Used sherry instead of white wine and that was excellent.  Did not double the sherry though, just added a dash more.  

Five stars with the addition of Parmesan cheese!

This was extremely bland.  I couldn't even eat it.  My husband ate his plate, but only after he covered it in bbq sauce.  The only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because the chicken came out really tender, and we were able to use it to make tostadas the next night.

As other reviewers said, I used chicken broth instead of wine (didn't have any) and only 1/2 cup sour cream.  I also browned the chicken before cooking, using more paprika.  It made the sauce a little orange, but we all loved it. The sour cream made it exceptionally rich.  Next time I'll use less.  This is a keeper!!!

This was delicious.  I am glad that I was home all day because this did need to be stirred up a bit.  It did start to look a little funny after a few hours undisturbed.  This is completely worth it.  Made egg noodles for the extra sauce and even added some provel cheese.  Turned out great.  Thanks for the post.

I was very excited to try this recipe!  Unfortunately, it was quite disappointing.  It was very bland.  We had to add tons of salt to give it any flavor at all.  The chicken was very tender, but the soupy mixture did nothing for us.  I don't plan to try this recipe again.

This came out like garbage.  6-8 hours was definately too long - as it disintegrated my chicken.  This prob would not be bad in the oven - but not especially suitable for the slow cooker.

Fabulous just the way it is.  I used 2 skinless/boneless breasts and 4 small skinless/boneless thighs. They were frozen when I put them in the slow cooker on low for 7 hours.  When it was almost done (one hour to go) I added artichoke hearts halved and increased temp to High.  The chicken  was done to perfection, the sauce was great and my husband loves it.  Said, "Let's have this again next week".  He normally is not too happy with chicken except fried.

Followed the recipe exactly.  As others have said, there was a funny taste to this that I could not quite place.  It was bland on top of that as well.  Will not be making this again.  Sorry.

Made this for a friend and my boyfriend, both with very different tastes in food. They both loved it, raving with their mouths full etc. I was worried it would taste too 'cream of mushroom soupy'; as my Grandmother would over do the 'cream of' soups in her cooking. But it really turns into a nice creamy sauce. I made it exactly as written and honestly it does not need a thing, except maybe salt and pepper to taste once it hits the plate. I think next time I make it, I will throw extra mushrooms in because I love mushrooms, and maybe a pinch of garlic powder, but it's not bland, even though it sounds seasonless. Try it. =)

Made exactly as directed, and tasted good! Even better next day, actually. Needed to mix up the sauce a bit after cooking, but it was tastey! Don't need to season chicken with salt, there's enough in there already with other ingredients. Good over mash, but I'm sure rice or with a side of veg would be great, too. Chicken was very tender.  Thanks for sharing & enjoy!

This recipe was delicious and super easy to make.  After reading the comments I sprinkled Goya Adobo seasoning and 1 t herbs de provance on the chicken and added 2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard to the sauce.  I also sprinkled the chicken with Locatelli Romano cheese while I held in the oven waiting for my family to arrive home.

Comments on the wine taste may be caused by the wine used.  I used a Bin 65 Chardonay (from COSTCO 2 bottles under $7.00) and the wine flavor was mild but quite tasty.  I follow the old adage, only use a wine for cooking that you would enjoy drinking!

I served this dish with German Spaetzle noodles, Cuban Bread, and Broccoli that I had roasted in the oven, so I am re-naming my version Slow Cooker Chicken Parisienne Internationál.

The wine accompanying the meal was a Pinot Grigio.

Followed others' advice and added garlic, parmesan, art. hearts and left uncovered for last hour.  Used frozen chicken breasts.  Everyone loved it and it presented well- I added enough paprika to color it and threw in a little chipotle pepper seasoning at the end.  Added leftovers to elbow mac and served as a casserole, which was even better!  Thanks!

I thought this recipe very tasty.  I cooked it a bit long so the chicken was a tiny bit dry but that was my fault.  Thoroughly enjoyed this chicken.   Spoon the chicken and sauce over noodles and it is great with a salad.    I think I may try and add some chopped celery next time, as I enjoy celery with my chicken.

Followed the recipe, using fresh mushrooms but not adding them or sour cream mixture until last hour of cooking.  Tasted fine, but very bland.  Even adding salt, pepper, garlic, season-salt, paprika, thyme... Still very lackluster.  Used a slightly tart Pinot Grigio, will try a more mellow Chardonay in the future for better wine flavor.

This was excellent served over mashed potatoes. I left out the mushrooms just so the kids would eat it. I used frozen chicken breasts and they were cooked through with no extra time added and very tender.

I thought this was a good base recipe..I think the ease of this recipe is that you can adjust the flavor to your own tastes..I added in fresh mushrooms, more wine =), garlic and onion. I knew from reading this it would not satisfy my garlic loving taste buds but I liked the overall ease of it. Add whichever spices you like in this..rosemary, thyme, garlic, onion or a drop of worchestire..thanks for a good base recipe =)

Boy, am I glad I waited a day to rate this!  When I made this yesterday, it tasted like boiled chicken to me, but after sitting in a fridge for one night, it tastes pretty good!  I cooked it for 6 hours (in a 7 qt slow cooker) and by the time it was done I could not pick it up with the fork because it was falling apart.  So tender!  But I would definitely let it sit overnight - it makes such a difference!

We loved this.  It was a perfect Sunday dinner for a wet and windy evening.

I followed the tips suggested previously.  I browned the chicken breasts after marinating them in oil, dried basil, paprika, garlic powder and thyme.

When making the sour cream mixture, I used low fat sour cream and added a tablespoon of chicken stock powder.  

I also used fresh mushrooms.  They softened nicely during the slow cooking process.

I was so surprised that the chicken was so tender,  I often have trouble making skinless chicken breast stay tender.

We served this with blanched sugar snap peas and brown rice.

Delicious!  Can substitute a soy product (eg, Tofutti Sour Supreme) for the sour cream.

This was very simple to make a my children & husband loved it!  The kids asked me to make it again this week.  I didn't even have canned mushrooms & it still was great.  For those that stated it was too bland, just season the chicken more to your liking prior to cooking.  Served the chicken with rice & green beans.

This recipe is GREAT! I did add a bit of garlic and onion powder, and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  My family loves it and there are never any leftovers.

Unfortunatly, I did not really like this recipe. I thought it lacked flavour and basically had the taste of a piece of chicken with a can of cream of mushroom, nothing else. I guess for someone who is used to foods with lots of spice and garlic, this was really bland in comparison.

I see that many people really enjoyed this dish.  However we found it to be just O.K.  I took some advise from past reviews and added garlic and onions.  I did use sliced fresh mushrooms, as opposed to canned, which turned out well.  But the overall dish just wasn't fabulous. I would not serve this at a dinner party.  But it was ok for just us family.  IF I make this again, I will use chicken thighs for better consistency and flavor.  I served this over buttered pasta with fresh parsley.  But I would suggest white rice.  Garlic bread did pair nicely.

Wonderful, and so easy.  I made this for company, served over aromatic rice with fresh rolls and a green salad.  It was delicious and everyone had at least two servings!

A good recipe that I will make again.  Kids loved the mushroom sauce on their rice.  Next time I will add some garlic and/or onion to give it a little more flavor.  I used 4 chicken breasts and and there was enough sauce for everyone's chicken and the rice I made to go with it.  If using 6 breasts, I might try doubling the sauce.  Next time I will try it with pasta.

Next time I make this, I'll scale back the amount of wine -- my husband and I liked the taste, but my mother commented that it had a strong wine flavor.  I think reducing the wine will also help thicken the sauce, although I may also try a smidge more flour as a thickening agent as well!  Very good, though, with egg noodles and asparagus!

This was delicious!  The broth/sauce over a bed of rice with the chicken made a delicious and hearty meal.  I added garlic as well.  My children ages 14 and 8 loved it.  My older daughter came home wet and tired from a cross country meet. She immediately upon entering the house said "That is what dinner  is supposed to smell  like!"..... this is a phrase every mother wants to hear lol

This is very good!  The only change I made to the recipe was to use twice as many mushrooms because we like them.  I might even use more next time...or use more of a variety of veggies.  This is definitely a keeper recipe!

This was a great meal. These are the alterations I made.   Used "healthy request" mushroom soup and used real mushrooms rather than canned.    I did not cook the 6-8 hours as it did not need it.  I would make again.

LOVE THIS. It is my go-to chicken and rice recipe. Sometimes I leave out the can of mushrooms since I'm not a huge fan of them but it turns out great anyway. My original recipe, which I got from my mother in law, says not to add the sour cream and flour until 30 minutes before serving. Good stuff!

My Guy loved this dish..I did spice it up a little more based on some of the other ratings..It was a little soupy...so I did take the  top off of the slow cooker for the last hour and turned it  to high..added frozen peas the last half hour (cooked it a total of 5.5 hrs)...will make this again..thanks

Wow! I am always looking for crockpot chicken recipes that cook 8hours and this one is fabulous. When I went to make it I decided to double the sauce (I have a lap band and nosed food moist). Of course I had only bought enough ingredients for it as written. I had enough sour cream and white wine, but ended up mixing the Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic with a can of Golden Mushroom. The chicken was fall apart moist and the sauce was heavenly.

This tastes better than it looks.  As for smells, my house stinks from mushrooms, again the taste makes up for it!  Next time I would add diced sweet ham and diced potatos and/ or string beans.  I served this over pasta.  Good dish if you can get over the look.

This was excellent.  I read the reviews before I made it for the first time and did change things a bit.  I doubled the sauce recipe and I used cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic and fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  I also added a 14 oz can of artichoke hearts the last hour of cooking.  I used more seasonings then just the salt, pepper and paprika.  I used garlic powder, onion powder and fresh chopped basil.  You can really use any kind of seasonings that you like.  I served it over egg noodles.  My family enjoyed it too and we all agreed that I should definitely make it again.

We really liked this. I served this over basmati rice with a mixed vege and it was excellent. I used 8oz. fresh sliced mushrooms and cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom. Very easy to make and fills the house with a wonderful aroma throughout the day. Thanks!

Easy to prepare, but I also found this a little bland.  I would probably make it again but would add some garlic, onion and additional herbs.

This was good, but as noted elswhere, somewhat bland. Also, I think the cooking time is a bit long.  I will try it again and give it a bit of zip.

although I am not one for cream-soup based anything,prefer food w/more flavor and zing, and DH hates white-livered food, I had a can of f.f. cream mushroom soup that had been in the cupboard forever, and didn't want to heat up the house.  Used 4 bone-in skinned breasts, used sherry in lieu of wine, and forwent the flour.  Had f.f. sour cream and used that.  With the addition of 3 cloves garlic, fresh chopped parsley,tbsp. of chicken soup base, and 1 large onion cut into larger chunks, this did have a pretty good taste.  I used lots of paprika to disguise the white-livered appearance.  Put it in the crock last night on low and done this morning.  It smelled very appealing so hubby did try some for lunch.  If I can get him to eat anything like this, I'm doing good.  Inexpensive dish to prepare w/much ease.  Just add some extras and you have a meal.  Cooked some egg noodles to serve over.  Bone-in chicken was very tender and juicy.

I added a little minced onion & garlic powder.  Also didn't add the sour cream and flour until the last 1/2 hour of cooking time.  Very good served with egg noodles.

So easy!  I used frozen chicken breast that I didn't bother to thaw.  I followed advice and turned heat on high for last hour with top off to cook off alcohol.  Next time I will use lots and lots of fresh mushrooms, garlic & maybe onion.  Served over whole wheat spaghetti.

This tastes like a dish from a four-star luxury restaurant!  We adored it!  We used skinless, boneless chicken thighs and seasoned with Emeril's Original Essence mix instead of paprika.  The chicken melted like butter in our mouths.  This is going into permenent 2 week rotation at our house.  Thank you so much for sharing!

This turned out very well, the only thing I did different, I added some garlic. The kids ate it up! I cooked this on a night I worked, and hubby served it, and there were no leftovers! This is a great recipe for us, as hubby can make it too! Will definately make this again!

My daughters comment was "The sauce is a little tangy."  She loved the flavors in this dish and the way the chicken fell appart was terrific.  I may try this with bone in chicken breast in the future, with the skin removed, to cut down on cost because the chicken was so tender.

Admittedly, I tried this recipe using nonfat sour cream, but it just seemed to lack something.  The chicken had a strange consistency - tender, but almost gritty.  It was creamy and the mushrooms were good, but it wasn't great.

If you like beef stroganoff, you'll like this.
Be careful not to overcook the chicken, though.
I cooked mine for 6 hours on low and that was plenty.  My husband and I loved it served over wide egg noodles!

Never used a slow cooker before... it was GREAT!  Used Condensed Cream of Mushroom with Roasted Garlic Soup and added one Tablespoon of Vermouth.  Would probably cook for 5-6 hours instead of 6-8.  Great Flavors!!

I read most of the reviews and took some key suggestions, added rosemary, thyme and a full cup of white wine, added more mushrooms (used fresh). Its not visually appealing, but it tastes great!  I'm adding broccoli and orzo pasta to make it a meal.  My only gripe, it was done on low in 4 hours. I had super huge chicken breasts so I only used 3, maybe that's why.  Supper is done at 2pm. :/ Hopefully, it doesn't get gross on the warm setting for 2 hours. :(

This turned out really good!  I read some comments and seasoned the chicken more to my liking by adding a little cayenne powder, basil, garlic powder, minced garlic, and onion powder.  I also used the golden mushroom soup.  I sauteed cut up chicken in bite size pieces then added the wine, mushrooms, and soup.  I cooked on stove top.  I added the sour cream mixed with flour last.  Everyone loved it except my one son who does not like mushrooms.  My husband and I got seconds, yum :)

We were disappointed.  I expected a thicker sauce since flour is an ingredient in the sauce.  The sauce also had a taste that can only be described as "off putting".  The chicken also turned out dry.  Will not be making this again.

This was incredible! The leftovers were even better. I followed the recipe exactly except I left out the mushrooms. I added a lot of extra paprika, but it didn't need any extra salt. I also used Trader Joe's condensed portabella mushroom soup, which cut out the MSG (found in Campbell's). I will make this again and again! Great over whole wheat egg noodles.

I liked this, but I used less chicken, added garlic,  8oz FRESH mushrooms, and some chopped spinach for flavor and color. suggestion: using fresh mushrooms = a little more flour. I used 1/3 c. and it turned out well.

This was an excellent recipe for a very busy day and night.  It cooked while I picked a close friend up from the airport.  He has eaten all over the world so I hoped he would enjoy this.  I used 8 chix thighs, 32oz. fresh mushrooms (we love them), and doubled the rest needed for sauce so we'd have plenty to serve over wheat pasta.  Since Chardonay was a recommended wine - I used it in the recipe. It rocked for children (who eat everything) and adults alike!  Our guest liked it so much, we had large bowl left over and he insisted on eating it for lunch the next day.  Thanks, Judith!  I forgot to add the flour because of the flurry of activity around my house and it wasn't the end of the world.  The sauce had more liquid because of the fresh mushrooms and no flour, but over pasta ... it was perfect.

OMG!!! This is wonderful! I made it tonight and never would have thought it was going to be this good. My husband, who never brags on my cooking much, just could'nt stop. He said it was the best he ever had. And  there was a creamy "gravy" in the slow cooker after cooking it so I put it over the mashed potatoes that I also served with it, along with green beans. Thanks so much for the recipe. Will make again and again. Wonderful dish for company too!

A little bland, so add some additional pepper.  But still a good dish with enough sauce to pour over rice.

I added rosemary, onion and a can of cream of chicken, and used only 1/4 wine. I served it over buttered angel hair noodles. There were no leftovers!

This was ok. I added cheddar cheese and some broccli to add some flavor but it still came out a little bland.

Assembled and cooked recipe as written but used fresh chicken tenders and a carton of fresh mushrooms.  Chicken was tender and sauce was delicious; served over egg noodles.  Easy, economical and now a new family favorite.

This was awesome!  I brought my slow cooker out of hibernation and I am now a believer!  I used chicken thighs on the bone and boneless chicken tenders and the chicken on the bone was definitely the winner.   The chicken literally fell off the bone with a spoon, it was so tender and succulent.  Love the gravy, too!  It tastes like a stroganoff and with only half a cup of white wine, I didn't notice a strong wine taste at all.   I am thinking that I just might have to substitute the egg noodles for mashed potatoes and the chicken for a small turkey and make this for Thanksgiving!  Also, I used low-fat sour cream and fat-free cream of 'shroom soup and it was still extremely flavorful with a few shakes of onion and garlic powder.   Outstanding recipe!

We liked this one. I added fresh mushrooms and reduced the sour cream b/c i didn't want it to taste like strogonoff. added a little bit of Worcestershire sauce. This is a good basic recipe to work with if you like to improvise. my only critique is that it lacks color and visual appeal. but tasty.

I liked the basis for the recipe, but found it lacking in some flavor levels and presentation; it's clearly the trade-off for simplicity (which is so great with this recipe!).   This recipe is a great base from which to build some experiments upon!  I substituted an additional 1/4 C of flour and 1/2 C of buttermilk for the sour cream (this one, honestly, was not wanting to have to run to the store...), replaced the canned mushrooms (deviation from the traditional, but adds texture and color, and the condensed mushroom brings the same mushroom taste in) with 2/3 C rough chopped broccoli florets, an additional clove of garlic and teaspoon of fresh ground black pepper, a dash of chili powder (little kicker), and added some rough chopped parsley sprinkled over the whole thing right before putting the lid on.   As an additional alternative, I also pocketed the chicken and stuffed it with a slice of Swiss cheese and used toothpicks to keep it shut, kind of a la cordon bleu. Turned out FANTASTIC.

We've been making this recipe for years and absolutely love it! I don't usually rate recipes but when I saw this recipe only had four stars, I decided to add my two cents :) The only change we make is to use fresh sauteed mushrooms rather than canned mushrooms. It's comfort food at it's best....especially in the fall.

I love things that are quick and easy. This recipe is that and some. the only changes I did was I used 1 Tbsp. of minced garlic and cooking sherry instead of white wine I believe it added more depth and I used bone-in chicken thighs. This was very tasty I will be added this to my quick and easy go-tos!!

I didn't have cream of mushrooms, but I did have one of cream of mushrooms with roasted garlic.  I used this, and it was Great!  My husband (who doesn't really like anything with cream of mushrooms) loved it!

This was exactly the slow cooker recipe I've been looking for for years-but I did a couple things differently because of what I had on hand and I think it made it even better. I used cooking sherry instead of white wine and I also used less sour cream than it called for. Will make often!

oh dear. kinda disappointing. I even sauteed the chicken with onions and garlic on the stovetop before putting everything into the slow cooker. Used double cans of Cream of Mushroom with Garlic. Texture was not the problem - the chicken was fall-off-the-bone-tender, but the general flavor was just bland.  Reminds me of bland stroganoff. I served it over egg noodles.  Not enough flavor to this dish for me to want to make it again.

Delicious! I have been looking for a simple recipe for a dish I had at a little Paris bistro.  I used chicken thighs because I didn't have breasts.  I also doubled the sauce ingredients because we love sauce.  I used 1 cup of sauvignon blanc, 1 can of cream of mushrooom (I only had one) and one can of cream of chicken, about 1.5 pounds of fresh sliced mushrooms, and added a tablespoon of dried tarragon and a teaspoon of dried thyme.  I served it over a bed of steamed, nutty brown rice.  So good!  So easy!

My hubby LOVED this meal. I, however, wasn't sure about it. I NEVER cook with alcohol and had to buy white cooking wine and I'm not sure if I liked it. But because my husband loved it, I'll probably make it again (especially since I have a bottle of white cooking wine to use up).

This is very easy and good, but next time I will add some garlic and maybe some more seasoning.  I will also add 1/2 as much flour.  I will make this again with these adjustments.

This is ok, the wine kind of gave it a twang. Next time I might sub wine for chicken stock. Also the flour/sour cream mixture turned into little  balls instead of fully disolving.

Tried this the other night for a family dinner and everyone agreed this meal was only okay.  At the suggestion of others we turned the heat up on the slow cooker and took off the cover for about a half hour.  I also seasoned the chicken with some Tony Chachere's seasoning and added in some basil and thyme.  The flavor was good and slightly similar to another recipe on this site Chicken Danielle which is a bit more time consuming but far superior in taste to this.

I have made this recipe, only once, but will definitely make it again!  The only thing that I did differently is to brown the chicken real good first, and added 1 cup of white wine instead of 1/2 cup.  It was a real family pleaser!  Two thumbs up!!

I can't get over how easy this was, and really pretty good.  I threw 2 very big frozen chicken breasts in the pot in the morning with the other stuff, and when I got home ten hours later it was so tender it was falling apart. Served over rice.  I added some chicken broth and it was too runny, so ended up putting more corn starch in it.  I didn't have any canned mushrooms, and didn't know what would happen if I added fresh, so I sauteed some fresh mushrooms after I got home and added them for the last half hour of cooking.  The wine was a little overpowering, I would probably reduce next time 1/4 cup wine and 1/4 cup chicken broth maybe?

Wonderful chicken!  Even my 7 y/o gave it a mmmm not too bad.  The wine was a little overpowering however, next time I think I'll cut it in half.  I mad a few changes based on other reviews.  I added sliced garlic, fresh mushrooms, sliced onion rings and used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom.  Will definately try again.

This was a decent recipe for the slow cooker.  I might try to use boneless/skinless chicken thighs the next time because the breast meat was a bit dry.  I had leftovers and it did taste better the next day after I shredded the meat and let it soak in the sauce.  Per another reviewer, I sprinkled the chicken with some Emeril's Original Essence and ground pepper.  Went great with a side of mashed potatoes.

This was my first attempt at using the slow cooker, and it was a smashing success! Following advice of other reviewers, I added 1 chopped onion, some garlic cloves and a bay leaf. Also I used fresh mushrooms. And finished it on high with the cover off. I had to work late so it ended up being on low for about 12 hours and the consistency and flavor were great. I can see using this as my slow-cooker base recipe, varying the flavors and ingredients a little bit each time.

I really liked this, but I did make a few changes.  I used Golden Mushroom soup instead, added a chopped onion and two cloves of minced garlic.  I put in the crockpot around 10 this morning and at 3 I took the cover off because it tasted wine-y (I used "Two-Buck Chuck" Chardonnay).  Then at 4 I took the chicken out and shredded it-- it was really moist and tasted great then-- and put it back in the pot.  I just reheated everything and then served over brown rice.  It makes a ton this way and no left over sauce as it's all together-- this made 8 cups!  Letting some of the wine cook off in the last hour is key I think.  Really good consistency with the shredded chicken-- before I shredded it the sauce was a little thin.  The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star is because I don't think we would have liked it with the cream of mushroom and we did have to add a bit of stuff.

Simple, easy to do, and hard to screw up.  i added a few fresh herbs, and a couple of slugs of sherry, and served over wide egg noodles.

This is so good and so easy!!!!!  I couldn't believe the flavor!  I added fresh mushrooms, instead of canned (like the flavor better) and followed everything else exactly as written.  A+  This will be made in our house several times a month....GUARANTEED!

No one in my family cared for this.  It had the consistency of wall paper paste and tasted about the same.  We're pretty picky eaters though and it was my first attempt to cook something in a slow cooker.  I added baby portabello mushrooms and fresh chopped garlic to give it a little extra something.  Still lacked in the flavor department. It did make the house smell good.

My husband and I enjoyed it, but found it had a strong wine taste and not enough spices. I added red peppers and more spices, but still missing something... It was definitely easy to make and I'll try it again, though.

Slow Cooker Chicken Parisienne Haiku: "A cinch to make this. Pour it in and turn it on. Final dish - okay!" I made this recipe exactly as directed and I will say that my 8 yo and 15 mo both loved it - especially the sauce spooned over their egg noodles. I agree w/ the review that it had an unusual sour taste, but not due to sour cream. Sometime about those particular creamy ingredients sitting in the slow cooker for that long just took on a flavor that didn't quite agree w/ me. I will make this again, but adapt it for the stovetop or oven instead I think. Thanks for the recipe!!

This could be a very good dish with a little tweaking.  I felt that it was somewhat bland, as written, and if I make again, will add at least garlic.  The sauce didn't thicken at all, and remained runny.  The dish had an ok flavor, but nothing spectacular or anything to make it pop.

Absolutely delicious and super easy to prepare! A really convenient dish to make when busy, but tastes just as good as a fussy, delicate recipe that makes you stand by the stove for hours! Definitely making this a regular dinner dish.

This has been a family favorite of our for years. My mom used to make it when I was a little girl and she would host formal family parties and everyone loved it then...and now 30 years later my family still loves it.  I do make some changes. I use both chicken breast and chicken thighs. I add a pinch of sage to my chicken dry rub seasoning. After I season the chicken I dip them in flour and sear the outside (skin down) in a pan of olive oil until the skin is golden brown. In the pan with the chicken drippings I saute a half of onion, 4 minced garlic cloves and use some of the wine to get up all the bits and add this to my crockpot with the chicken and a can of mixed veggies.  I then proceed with the recipe as usual. This is very good and filling. Serve with hot rice and top with a sprig of parsley. A definite crowd pleaser

Unfortunately we didn't like this even with some of the hints of other reviewers.  Was very bland but will admit was pretty good for a leftover quick lunch.  I won't be adding it to the recipe box though.

This was really good - but even better, the kids asked to take the leftovers for lunch!!! My husband had two bowls and the kids really liked it - so this is a five-star recipe.  Easy to throw together and ready after football practice.

Simply wonderful! My husband, who tends to like spicy, tomato-based sauces, loved it. I did what others advised and uncovered the slow cooker and set it to HIGH for the last half hour of cooking to allow the alcohol evaporate. I served over buttered egg noodles with parsley and steamed broccoli with a few squirts of fresh lemon juice.

Great Recipe. I have making this for years only thing different is I don't use the flour. I also make it in the oven instead of the slow cooker I cook it the oven for about 30 minutes at 350 degrees.

This was the first recipe I made in my new (to me) slow cooker a month ago.  I made it as is, but added about 5 ounces of frozen artichoke hearts, because I love them with chicken and mushrooms.  In the slow cooker, they dissolved into the sauce and made it awesome.

This was good, but I definitely will try adding a bit more wine to keep it more moist.

This is good but it needs more seasoning than it calls for - such as garlic & onion powder. I'll try it again but I'll add more to it.

I followed another comments advice and added rosemary.  I wouldn't do that next time.  It gives it a taste that my husband and I didn't especially like.  However, it did smell delicious.  I also sub. chicken broth for the wine.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is one that will stay in the supper rotation. I made this a couple of days ago and Hubby is still talking about how good it was. Some have said it was bland....you have to season to taste...it is a subtle flavor, but oh so good and worth doing again.

Really good and easy recipe.  I used chicken wings instead of breast as I do not particularly like white meat.  The sauce was wonderful.  Served with mashed potatoes and fresh sauteed green beans...will definitely make agian!

This is DEFINITELY a company recipe.  My daughter served it last night to company and everyone raved over it.  She works, so she put it in the crockpot and served it over wild rice.
It was delicious and will be among my favorite recipes.

Tasty, though a tiny bit blander than I expected--it didn't taste quite as good as it smelled.  Perhaps next time I'll add more garlic and seasoning.  Very good over noodles.

I really like the fact that this is a very easy recipe to make.  The chicken is very tender, but it was a little bland.  I will definently make it again and try to add a little flavor to it.

I was very excited to try this dish, but I don't know what happened, as I followed this recipe to a "t" - except I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and added a little garlic as per suggestions from other reviewers. It wasn't creamy, and was very bland. I let it boil off a little bit towards the end, but I still wound up with a watery and oily mess served over egg noodles that my boyfriend barely choked down and I had to add more salt to my plate than I ever would to any food to get it to taste like something. Sorry, but I was disappointed.

EDIT: Well, I'll say this is a recipe that gets better with time. I had the leftovers the next day and they were better, and four days later, it actually is creamy, and not so bad. I'd give it an extra half star for staying power, except I can't give half ratings. Maybe I'll try this again.

I thought this was very good, but my husband didn't care for it at all.  (Therefore we'll give it a 3 - I'd give it a 5, he'd give it a 1.)  It sort of reminded me of Betty Crocker's recipe for Turkey Tettrazini.  We used sherry instead of wine and halved the sour cream, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I'd make it again although only when he's out of town!  :-)

This was delicious. My husband is not a huge fan of slow-cooker food but I just didn't have the time so I made this recipe. He loved it! I served the chicken with extra paprika over eggnoodles. I will make this again!

Pretty good.  I shared it with a co-worker of mine and she absolutely enjoyed it.  This is my first time cooking anything in a slow cooker that calls for chicken and I was very surprised at how it turned out.  Some tips that I could have kept in mind:  Don't over season and add too much oregano if you plan to do so...it does make the flavor of the sauce a little weird - there is something missing from this too, almost a little bland - maybe adding some Emeril seasoning and salt would have added more spice...but overall it was pretty darn good.  I would definitely make again for my boyfriend and I.  Thanks for sharing.

The chicken was definitely tender, and the flavor was alright. We all ate it fairly well, and it's a simple dinner (which is a big plus), but it wasn't spectacular. I was a little worried about it later in the day because it looked like the sour cream had curdled, but I suppose that's just the way it looked after not being stirred for a few hours. Decent recipe.

I tried this with sliced onion and quartered apples, but the taste was "off". Maybe next time will use cream cheese instead of sour cream.Additional spices help.

The chicken was very moist, however we didn't care for the flavor of the sauce.  I think it was the white wine that overpowered it (will omit the wine if I make it again).  I used golden mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom & used fresh mushrooms.

This chicken was great, the sauce was delicious. I sprinkled the chicken with some garlic powder and seasoning salt along with the pepper and paprika since other reviewers said it was a bit bland. It came out really tasty. I added onions instead of mushrooms and served over egg noodles.

The chicken came out very moist and the sauce had a nice consistency to go with rice or noodles.  I just felt it was very bland and needs something to give it some spicing up.  I tried sprinkling some cajun seasonings in at the beginning, but it wasn't enough.  I'll try it again though, it is worth playing with.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I used fresh mushrooms, also, and I shredded the chicken in the crock pot.  The bonus is that the next day, I added the leftovers and the cooked rice to some chicken broth, and I had a very filling and very good soup.

Yum.  The flavor of the sauce is similar to something my mother makes.  I love the fact that I can just throw it all in a slow cooker!  I served over rice.

I have been making this dish for almost 50 years in the oven. I tried it in the crock pot for the first time today. I added onion, garlic, and used chicken broth instead of wine. I served over steamed white rice. I love this dish and now I have one more "crock meal".  
You can also mix it up with any creamed soup. Try cream of chicken, broccoli, potato, whatever. Also, you can add frozen peas, or broccoli. Like all recipes, make it your own.

One of our favorite recipes.  I use chicken tenders and cook on high for 2.5 - 3 hrs. Definitely salt & pepper and be generous with the paprika.  With 30 minutes left, add the sour cream (mixed well with 1-2 T. of flour and 1-2 T. of juice from crockpot).  Also just discovered Campbell's Cream of Cremini & Shitake Mushroom Soup, and also canned Cremini mushrooms....those made a big difference!  I've used fresh mushrooms in the past and we do like that, too. Prefer this over white rice instead of noodles.

I found this recipe in a slow cooker cookbook.  It is slightly different from this one.  The chicken breasts are cut up first and the sour cream is not added until the last 30 minutes. Also you can also use cream of chicken soup instead.  No flour ...although it is possible to have to add it at the end.  It is a tasty recipe..really good over noodles.

This was delicious and so easy to make. I made it in 7 hours with my crockpot with one chicken breast.  It was so filling. I have no tweaks to add to it. I've used Birdseye Tuscan Blend rice to accompany the meal.

This was simple and great. I used sliced fresh mushrooms (don't like the texture of canned!) and garlic salt instead of regular, and served over rice. I loved how quickly it came together!

I like the recipe for it's base and very easy crockpot meal.  I however took Crystal S. suggestion and added seasonings and 1st prepped in a fryin pan  "...browned the chicken in olive oil using a mixture of flour, garlic, seasoning salt, paprika, and onion powder..."  I then moved the chicken to the crock pot and used the wine to deglaze the frying pan and then combined soup and sour cream and stirred in slowly to the wine.  Then poured this over the chicken. At the end of 7 hours I took the lid off and increased the heat as suggested.  This was delicious served on egg noodles and my 9 year old had 3 servings and my picky 11 yr old helped himself to seconds!  The husband asked that I put this on meal rotation!    Since I was out of mushrooms I will add them next time.

This is a delicately flavored dish.  I had my doubts because salt, pepper, and paprika didn't seem like enough seasoning.I'm glad I made the recipe as written. The white wine and sour cream blend nicely with the mushroom soup to make a delicious sauce! I used chicken thighs instead of breasts. The meat was tender and juicy. I would serve this to company, and I'll definitely make it again.

This is a great recipe for a cold, rainy day! Just put it on and forget it. I use fresh mushrooms instead of canned and I usually add instant rice a few minutes before serving it (although you could use noodles). My husband loves this and takes leftovers to work with him.

I made this recipe tonight with minimal substitutions/ additions and it turned out great! As other reviewers suggested I doubled the amount of mushrooms (fresh) and used Golden Mushroom Soup. I also added 1/2 of a small diced onion and a glove of garlic. I cooked for about 5 1/2 hours on low and then turned it in high and removed the lid for the last 30-45 min. I served it over egg noodles and broccoli. Delicious! Next time I think I'll try rice and green peas!

Fixed as written. The first words out of my husband's mouth when he took his first bite was, "This is really good chicken!". The sauce was quite runny, even though I turned the temperature to high for 1/2 hour. I poured the sauce over brown rice and the flavor was wonderful. Will keep in my Favorite file!

Gross, I dont know what I did wrong, but it was bland beyond comparison. I will admit we are not much of soup/casserole eaters. Usually our foods are lighter in taste and calories.

This was very yummy.  I might try it over noodles next time, as it had a lot of sauce which would make it nice.

Sauce was delicious, but chicken was dry.  Would recommend cooking 6 hours, not 8.  Will definately make this again.

This chicken dish is extraordinary in
flavour and texture,I served with
roasted and green vegetables,it was
superb! Fit for a king,even though it 
was my husband,a friend and I we
enjoyed the dish as if it had been prepared by a chef.

Family loved it - might have been better with fresh mushrooms
