I will definitely make this chili when the temperature drops.  However, no msg for people with high blood pressure.

Very good chili. I left out the MSG because I don't use it. I forgot to add the parsley but It was still very good. It is very unfair of someone to rate this recipe and give it 1 star when they haven't even made it.  I would give it 10 stars if I could just to even out the overall rating.
