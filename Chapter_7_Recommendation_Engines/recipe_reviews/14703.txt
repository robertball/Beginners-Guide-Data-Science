I had planned on making these asparagus medallions exactly like the recipe stated. However when I got to the grocery store they were out of the Cream of Asparagus soup. I substituted Cream of Broccoli. I seasoned 4 boneless pork chops with an all purpose greek seasoning and then browned them in olive oil. When they were nice and brown I deglazed the pan with 1/4 cup of white wine. To this I added a small can of portabello mushroom chunks and a 1/4 cup of chicken broth and reduced it down slightly. I then added the Cream of Broccoli soup covered and simmered for about 20 minutes. The pork was tender and the gravy was wonderful on mashed potatoes.

My kids hate everything but they liked this. It was quick and easy. I had no cream of asparagus so I used cream of mushroom and it was great. A keeper!

I found this dish easy to prepare and cook. Cook it with White rice and fresh Aspargus and you have a really healthy meal that tastes realy good. My boyfriend really enjoyed it.

This was unique despite simple ingredients I seasoned the pork (loin chops in my case) with salt and pepper and simmered for about 45-50min longer than recommended but I used really low heat. Make sure you get the soup on all sides of the meat I just had it on top and it was still good but I plan to do so next time. Excellent with brown rice.

This was very good. I used Cream of Mushroom instead and did this all in a pan not the oven. I used a little butter with minced garlic and sealed my pork by cooking on med/high heat on each side for a few minutes. Poured the cream of mushroom in used about half a cup of apple cider and sliced a few apples to cook with the sauce. It was excellent topped over rice.

Very good! I used Cream of Celery since I didn't have Cream of Asparagus. I served over white rice with a side of asparagus. Will definitely make again.

Yum! Very good nice and tender. I would not advise serving this with asparagus on the side.It would be too much. I cut the recipe in half but otherwise made no other changes. I served this with seasoned rice. Thanks for the recipe.

This was GREAT I also cooked the pork with worchestire sauce. The whole family including a two and a very picky seven year old LOVED it!! My seven year old was shocked to find out that he ate asparagus. This was for sure one of the best recipes I have ever made from this site.

An easy recipe indeed tasty too! I followed some of the advice from the other reviews and seasoned the chops with season salt pepper & worchester sauce then browned the chops with some olive oil & butter..... gr8 recipe but i'd leave it to simmer a little longer than 30mins (maybe 45-50mins) as i still found the meat to be not as soft as it could be. Will definitely make this dish again. I served the chops with garlic mash & sauteed button mushrooms - yummy!

A bit of meat and a can of soup does not a recipe make. This one cries out for some seasonings worchestershire sauce some sauteed onions and mushrooms even some sauteed asparagus tips would add some much needed ingredients. Don't add extra salt however. Plenty in the soup.

Very good. The store did not have pork medallions on hand so I ended buying a pork tenderloin and cutting it in slices and pounding it thinner. This worked well and was so tender. (The butcher helped me with that one) Served with white rice and green beans.

Not bad but a little boring. Needs a little more seasoning on the pork or maybe onions.

This recipe was super simple and delicious. Will make again. I added a splash of Worcestershire sauce for flavor when I sauteed the meat.

This was just o.k. It was definitely a fast recipe but something about taking a nice piece of pork and throwing some cream of whatever soup over the top just doesn't seem right. Probably won't make again. Sorry

Great recipe! VERY easy to make! One comment though I made it with asparagus on the side and it was a bit too much asparagus...BUT the rice was a terrific side dish with this. I will definately make this again!

Super easy to make. Did still need a little something more like some herbs or garlic. Great to use as a base for a dish and I will make again with some additions.

My teenagers actually liked this! I didn't tell them about the asparagus. The meat was so tender and full of flavor. I might try it with sometime with mushroom soup which was mentioned or cream of chicken. A great easy way to prepare pork.
