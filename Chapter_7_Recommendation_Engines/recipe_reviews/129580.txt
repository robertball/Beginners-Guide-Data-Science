Thank you for sharing your fantastic recipe.  The finished product is just what I hoped for!  

I cooked the bread for 2 or 3 minutes longer than suggested, but I just moved to a new apartment and haven't got a feel for the new oven yet.

My problem was getting the rye meal!  I finally decided to chop up rye berries!  Other than that, the bread was easy to make!  The taste and texture were great! This goes real well with a hearty soup.  We will be making this again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I really like this recipe. I added a tiny bit of rye seasonings However I noticed that some were puzzled concerning rye meal or pumpernickel flour. This can be purchased online from www.kingarthurflour.com. Their flours are fabulous! They  also sell all sorts of baking tools & seasonings. I keep my flours in the freezer. You need to go online & look at their site. Also if you have any problems or baking questions, they have a free chat line and a baker will chat with you to help you.
