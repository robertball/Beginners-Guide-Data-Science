This is an excellent base recipe, but it lacks flavor and the ratio of ingredients should be adjusted.  Eight cups of water does not provide enough broth (at least if you're expected a result similar to standard chicken noodle soup recipes.)  Prepared as directed (and adding two more cups of water, there was far too much pasta and too little broth.  After we ate this and discovered how bland the broth was, I dressed up the leftovers with a can of chicken broth, onion salt, poultry seasoning and dried parsley flakes.  I think future enhancements I would make would be to rub the uncooked chicken with seasonings, because the cooked chicken didn't have much flavor, either.  I would also use about 2 cans of chicken broth (perhaps seasoned broth) in place of some of the water.

I think this would be good in the slow cooker, simmering on low all day and adding the carrots and pasta at the very end.

Fantastic! I made the recipe (almost) faithfully the first time, and it was very good. However, I did make a few changes the second time around that made the soup even better.  First, much as I love rosemary, I did cut back by about half.  I also added closer to 12 c. of water, and threw in about 2 tsp. of solid chicken soup base for extra flavor.  Didn't have any penne on hand, so I used multi-colored rotini (which was great and added color and texture to the soup). Finally, I urge you to consider using boneless thigh meat in this recipe--soooo good! Not only does it offer a complex, gamey flavor, it's cheaper than buying breast meat! :)

Save yourself the trouble by not attempting it...especially at the prescribed levels of rosemary...much, much, much too strong!

This was the first time I have ever tried making any kind of soup(other than canned), and I can't begin to tell you how upset I got after making this recipe! And yes, I followed the recipe word for word! I guess I should say that I have only been cooking(other than frozen dinners) for about 6 months.
The recipe sounded just fine, however, after the first part of the recipe was boiled for one hour, I realized that I was in trouble. There was little to no liquid left in my pan. I still added the penne pasta, oil, and carrots anyway, as described in step two of the recipe, figuring that it was just my own lack of faith in my cooking skills that wasn't right.
Well, needless to say, after the pasta soaked up what little remaining broth there was, I was left with a thick mess of ingredients and no "soup"!
I have sworn that I will never try another soup recipe ever.

This was a wonderful and easy recipe.  I did make just a few changes.  I used 9 cups of water and 9 chicken  boulons for flavoring.  I wanted to end up with 8 cups for the soup and figured that I would probably lose one during cooking.  I used 4 chicken thighs and some chicken tenderloin. I love rosemary, so I didn't think that the taste was too strong.  It was just perfect for me.  I didn't use thyme, just rosemary.  Be sure and put the lid on the pot while you are cooking your soup for an hour and to turn down the heat to simmer, or you will lose too much of your liquid.  While the pasta was cooking for about 9 minutes I took out the chicken, cut it into small pieces and returned it to the soup. I served the soup with garlic bread.  The flavor was wonderful.  My husband loved it.  Will become a regular dish in our house. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Good base recipe but like everyone else did I had to add about 4 more cups of water and I used egg noodles instead of penne. I also added some spices including poultry seasoning and a little celery salt. I think next time I will cook the chicken breasts whole and take them out at the end to shred them and put them back in the pot with the noodles and the carrots.

I loved this recipe.  I followed all the main ingridients but also made some changes.  I added celery and more water (about 4 more cups). Since I added more water I also increased the amount of rosemary, thyme, garlic and onions (not by much though).  I only used 1/2 a box of penne. I didn't use the 2 TBSP of oil I only added 1/2 TBSP of oil. I also added the juice of 1 sour orange. If you don't have sour orange you can substitute it with lime (to your taste).  This recipe is great because it is healthy and all the ingridients used are without any preservatives and good for the body. I loved it!

Sooo yummy! I agree with everyone about cutting back on the rosemary, 1 1/2 tablespoons should be more than sufficient. My mom is allergic to wheat so anytime we make soup with noodles we'll always serve wheat noodles and rice noodles on the side. Now, even when I'm not cooking for her, it's my favorite thing to do! No more overcooked noodles yay! would be very good with celery. I also buy a rotisserie chicken precooked anytime I have chicken noodle, it's always much more moist

I tried this recipe and it was not very good, I used left over roasted rosemary whole chicken from the night before. The spices gave it a bland taste, with the absence of the chicken noodle soup flavor. I tried adding chicken stock but it was too late to save the dish.

The rosemary IS a bit strong. I would use 1T instead. I substituted celery and chicken broth for the chicken. It was quite tasty!

My grandmother used to make wonderful chicken & noodles and since she passed away I have never been able to get it quite right.... but thanks to you I FINALLY got it!!! With a little tweaking this tastes just like hers did! Some changes I made: 7 C water, 2 C chicken broth, omitted the carrots, used extra wide egg noodles, and cut back on the rosemary and added some Italian seasoning. Also had to add a bunch of salt (and I am not a salt fan at all). I'm giving you 5 stars because without you it would have taken me much longer to nail her recipe... thanks so much!

This was really good but the water measurement is WAY off. I had to add 2 cups of chicken broth and 2 cups of water after boiling the chicken in order to add the penne. I left out the oil and I used green onion instead of white. Next time I will double the amount of garlic.

Making this right now and the whole house smells amazing. Only changes I made was adding chicken bouillon cubes for flavor... Also would have rather used egg noodles than Penne but I did not have either so used bow tie noodles. I know its going to taste great! despite some lesser rateings.

There was a lot of changes to be made to this. I initially followed the 2 tbs of rosemary only to find I had to fish out most of it after the first bite. I did folow the others advise and add more water. The hour of boiling was a lil excessive. So I cut down the cooking time drastically. I also waited till the very end to add the noodles, I don't care for my noodles to be mushy. 20 mins of cooking noodles makes a mush. I prefer my chicken to be a little browned. So before I put the chicken into the pot I put some olive oil and a light dusting of sugar in a pan and seered both sides of the chicken in that. It gives the chicken a nice brown color and an extra flavor to the soup.

I ended up having to tweak this recipe a lot.  I used 12 cups of chicken bouillon, 1/2 cup of butter, and different seasonings.  I also used wide egg noodles instead of penne.

I thought this recipe was fantastic, but I made some changes: double the water, half the noodles (and I used egg noodles, as is traditional with this kind of soup, not penne pasta), add some chicken bullion for flavor.  I also cooked my chicken for only 35 minutes before taking it out and shredding it, added the carrots ahead of the noodles, and then boiled the noodles in the soup according to the directions on the package of noodles before adding the shredded chicken back in and boiling it for another couple of minutes.  In the long run, this turned out to be an excellent dish.  I happen to like rosemary, so I thought that proportion was correct.  One more tip: this is also good with some celery (added a few minutes after the carrots).  Enjoy!

Used tarragon and basil instead of thyme and red onion instead of white.... i think that was fine.
I listened to the other reviews...bland....not enough water.... and I compensated. But it was still bland and not enough water :( !
More salt and pepper help, post cooking time. I would add even more chicken stock, bullion, or what have you to make it worth your time. And the directions, while blissfully simple, don't advise any very literal people to reduce the soup to a simmer and cover for the hour and 20 of cook time. Jazz it up people, and it will be palatable.

First, unless you really love Rosemary, this recipe is not for you. And if you love Rosemary, use fresh, not dried!! I've never heard of chicken soup with boneless skinless chicken before.. Seems like this should be altered to be just a chicken and noodles dish, not soup. It's bland because there is no chicken skin/bone. Also, adding oil?? No way. This could be a good base recipe if you use the right chicken, spices, and NO OIL! also, add water about half way through. I'd cook it a lot longer too.

I used a can of chicken broth, then added enough water to make 12 cups (I don't know how the original author cooked all that chicken plus a whole pound of pasta in just 8 cups of water!). I also used only 1T of rosemary and only 12 oz. of pasta (egg noodles instead of penne). I used 1c. frozen onion and a bag of frozen carrots (no chopping!), and they turned out just fine. Next time I will add even more liquid, because it wasn't "soupy" enough, but still delicious. My daughter is a little on the picky side, and she inhaled this. Awesome base recipe!

I used 6 cups low sodium chicken broth and 2 cups water. After bringing to a boil, I added 1 large, boneless, skinless chicken breast with 1 fresh sprig of rosemary, half a chopped onion, 1 tsp thyme, 1 tsp freeze-dried lemongrass, 1/2 tsp each garlic powder, sea salt and fresh ground pepper.  I turned it down to barely simmer for an hour.  After removing the chicken breast, I added 3 medium, sliced carrots and returned it to the boil for 10 minutes.  Then, I added a single portion of linguine broken into quarters and boiled for another 20 minutes on medium. Lastly, I added the chopped chicken breast. This became a delicious, fragrant, homey soup. Yum!!!!

This recipe had mixed results for me. I made it exactly as written, using chicken breasts for the meat, and canola oil for the vegetable oil.
But I was skeptical of 8 cups of water sufficing for boiling for 1 hour and 20 minutes, so I had the pot on a very low boil, or maybe simmer. Even then, the soup wound up extra chunky. Worse, I thought that what liquid remained, was weak and not very flavorful - I would have added 1 or more bouillon cubes, had I known. Worse yet, when I had leftovers the next day, almost all of the liquid had been absorbed (presumably into the pasta).
The chicken/veggies/pasta/spices tasted nice, per se, for a simple chicken soup, but I thought the addition of a whole pound of pasta was overkill. Not to mention penne being pretty unusual in a "chicken soup". Overall, this recipe just didn't work very well for me.

To me, this is really more of a chicken and noodles than a soup.  As such, it felt more like it needed noodles, not pasta.  So we used a 12oz package of extra wide noodles and cooked for around 10 minutes.   Other changes were to add another clove of garlic, a shake of poultry seasoning, a bay leaf, seasoned salt, butter instead of oil, and a fair amount of pepper.  With those changes, it was a whole pot of goodness.  Add some crackers or a chunk of bread, and you're good to go.  I do think that you could get more flavor by using more from the chicken than just the breast meat, but it was still a nice meal.

My family loves this recipe. This last time I made it I did not have thyme so I searched for a substitute and found a recommendation that tarragon is a good sub on chicken. I also added 2 more cups of water, added a tablespoon of broth mix, and added a half bag of frozen peas. the last time I made this I had some left over to bring to work the next day. this time they devoured it!
