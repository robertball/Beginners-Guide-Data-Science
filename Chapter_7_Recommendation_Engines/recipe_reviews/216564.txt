This was DELICIOUS!!!! Meatballs were super tender spices were perfect, nice and savory. Gravy was very good (I'm going to try less sour cream next time but I like a meatier gravy) I made the gravy with the dripping like it called for but I used the pan I fried meatballs in earlier which had even more drippy goodness in it. I served the meatballs over rice but I might try noodles sometime. A word of caution, try to pace yourself while eating these it's easy to inhale a couple dozen and these deserve to be savored!

This dish was perfect. I wanted to try it as my grandmother used to make Swedeish Meatballs at Christmas times as well. The flavor is perfect and the gravy outstanding. Thank you for helping me create the same memories with my children. Thank you for sharing the recipe. The entire family loved it and my children will usally avoid anything with onions. They went back for seconds on this fabulous dish.

This is oh so good. I did a search online for the Swedish Name version. Tried some. This is by far the tastiest! After everything was done, I put in slow cooker on warm. Added noodles way al dente. When we were ready to eat, every taste blended wonderfully.

I usually hate it when when people rate recipes that they don't follow, but I'm guilty this time.  I skipped the meatballs and used beef stew meat.  Browned it off and threw it in the crockpot with all of your spices (including the optionals).  When the meat was tender, I thickend the sauce, added the sour cream and served over fresh pasta. Absolutely delicious!  I guess my version could be called Swedish stroganoff?  Very good recipe.  I will make the meat balls next time to honor your family tradition.

Definitely 5 stars!!!  I was hesitant to use what Americans call "baking spices" with meat but I'm so glad I tried this (including the ginger).  The spices are perfectly blended and very subtle. I served it over egg noodles which works great with the gravy & meatballs. I would be very proud to serve this to dinner guests.  The only change I made was to use 1/2 lb ground beef & 1/2 lb ground pork instead of the 2/3 & 1/3 ratio in the recipe (just for practicality -- I will be making this again soon!)

Nice tender meatball. I had my grandmothers swedish meatball in mind when I tried this.....but this doesn't have enough seasoning for my taste. Otherwise, lovely and simple but I would zap up the nutmeg and allspice a tiny bit. My grandmother used to put a tiny bit of the allspice in the gravy too. I also served this with tiny yellow potatoes, lingonberries and carrots and brussel sprouts. Very nice combo. Thanks for sharing this tasty recipe Nom Nom Nom :)

Hubs and I really enjoyed this tonight but I have to agree with the "most  helpful" reviewer - this was a tad too "sour creamy," so if I had it to do over again, I, too, would like a meatier gravy and reduce the amount of sour cream.  Also, looking at the mix of ingredients it seemed to me that it would produce a really  "wet" mixture.  I decided to hold off adding the chicken broth and I'm glad I did as the texture and consistency was just right without it.  Had I used it, I'm afraid it might have been too loose, making it more difficult to form the meatballs.  I did add the optional ginger.  Glad I did that too.  I formed the mixture into approximately 1" meatballs, and these required  only about 18 minutes in the oven at 400 degrees.   I used butter in place of the drippings for the roux.  The sour cream was different for me - I generally use heavy cream.  Wasn't sure I would like it as much, but not to worry, other than there being a little too much of it, we liked it nearly as well as we do when made with cream.  All and all, a good recipe - just needs some tweaking, I think, to perfect it to suit individual tastes and preferences.

I only made the meatballs from this recipe, not the gravy.  I also used groung turkey rather than beef & pork.  That said, it's the spices that really make this recipe.  I was afraid the meatballs would taste "odd" using spices usully reserved for baked goods, but it's actually really good.  After baking the meatballs, I put them in a covered casserole with a can of cream of chicken & a can of cream of mushroom soup with some milk to make a gravy.  I baked them for about 40 minutes & then served over egg noodles.  Yum!

Yuuuummmm!    This was so good - it vaguely reminds me of the Swedish meatballs my mother used to make whenever there was a party.   I didn't have time for "day-old" bread, so I lightly toasted two slices and crumbled those with the cream.  Also,  I used a bit more meat (closer to 1 lb. of beef, 1/2 lb. of pork) but otherwise everything else was the same.   I recommend using all the spices incl. the brown sugar and ginger.   They blend beautifully and the taste is subtle and delicious.   Great recipe; thanks to NomNomNom for posting!

I made this recipe to serve 50 people and it was a huge hit! I recived many compliments and several people wanted the recipe. I made it using the optional ingredients; the only thing I did differently was to substitute onion powder for the sauteed onions and I skipped the pan browning and baked the meatballs (over 350 of them!) in the oven until they were done. This is a wonderful recipe.

We thought these were fabulous!  I lightly toasted the bread before crumbling it, and the chunky breadcrumbs soaked in cream gave the meatballs a wonderful texture and flavor.  I wouldn't change a thing about the meatballs, including using the optional spices (I did use all ground beef, as this was what I had on hand).  For the gravy, I thought 1/2 container of sour cream was a bit too much.  I'd recommend adding 1/4 container, then adding to taste after that, as you can always add more, but you can't take away.  Really a terrific recipe that I'm sure we'll be enjoying many more times to come!

I followed recipe exactly like written... 
 I thought it was over the top sweet, almost like eating a cupcake. I think there were errors in cooking time, it took me well over 2 hours to make this and I am not an amatuer cook. I also think that if you try this recipe, do not add the sour cream to the simmered sauce unless you temper the sour cream or it can curdle. I'm sorry but very disapointed in this recipe. I only gave it a two star beccause the meatball was tender and moist which is always nice. Just thought too much went into this

I tripled the recipe thinking it sounded wonderful and that we would have some left overs to freeze or take for lunches. WRONG not even a single meatball left and as for the gravy well there is about a tablespoon left.  This was delicious and we will make again and again.  Thank you for sharing.

Delish! I used regular milk instead of cream, and I left out the sour cream, and they were still fantastic. I also used 1 cup panko breadcrumbs, as I don't usually have white bread in my house. My mother used a package mix to make these when I was young, and the spices are right on, but this is much better.

Making the meatballs is labor intensive, but so much better than the Costco variety. I made extra meatballs and froze the leftovers. 
For another meal, I made mushroom gravy. I sautéed 6 oz sliced mushrooms in 2 Tablespoons butter for about 3-4 minutes over med-med/high heat. The heat should be high enough to make the mushrooms expel their liquid, but not burn.  I added 1 Tablespoon flour, and cooked on low for a minute or two. I added 1/2-3/4 cup chicken broth instead of beef broth (which I didn't have) to form a roux. I cooked this on low, allowing it to thicken, then seasoned it with salt and pepper to taste, 1/8 tsp paprika and 1/8 tsp allspice. I added the meatballs 1/4 cup sour cream and let this simmer for just a few minutes. I served it with ligonberry sauce over spaetzle.   My husband LOVED it this way!  He didn't care for it the first time around with the simpler beef broth.

Awesome recipe! Made it to a "t" and it turned out fantastic, my whole family loved it. I don't understand the reasoning of the couple of reviewers who mentioned that "baking spices don't belong in a meatball recipe". Did you happen to read that this is a SWEDISH meatball? Don't dismiss a culture's traditional food just because you aren't open-minded enough to try something new. Besides, the majority of reviewers gave this recipe a resounding almost 5-star rating: that should really tell you something!

These were very good. Well worth the time and effort put into them. I did not have allspice on hand so I added a little cinnamon instead to the nutmeg and they were very good. I did not have beef broth-- used chicken instead and still delicious. I like it when recipes like this can be flexible. My family loved it! Thanks for your authentic recipe! I asked a real Swede for her recipe and I knew it was not real when it had cream of mushroom soup in it. This is the REAL DEAL!

I LOVE meatballs. This is a great recipe for authentic Swedish meatballs. I made one change though. We don't eat ground beef in my house so I used ground bison. The bison gave these meatballs a more robust flavor which the sauce accented very nicely. 
We have a saying in my house whenever I try a new recipe on my family... " that's a keeper". And this recipe is truly a keeper. Thanks !

This is one of my favorite recipes on this site, and i've tried A LOT! I didn't change a thing, although i do use the same pan i browned the meatballs in to make the gravy, that way you get all the wonderful flavor and less clean up! WIN-WIN! I served it over some homemade egg noodles and it was insanely delicious, my one year old gobbles this up! Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!!!

This is the 2nd time I have made swedish meatballs (I tend to play around with recipies to make them "mine") and couldn't find the last recipe I used. I AM SO GLAD I DIDN'T! This is by far the best I have tasted and by even looking at the recipe it is about the same as what I changed in the last one too! For everyone who is worried about the taste, give it a shot! The only change I made was to use 1/2 hamburger 1/4 pork sausage and 1/4 mild spiced sausage (we lie a little kick in our meat dishes though) It as DELICIOUS!

These meatballs are so tasty and moist, they are wonderful and I strongly suggest using the optional seasonings, it really adds to the flavor. This is the best Swedish Meatball recipe I have tried. I will use these meatballs in other dishes as well.

I rarely write reviews for anything, but this one was just too good not to rate. It turned out perfect. I served them over egg noodles to make more of a meal of it. The only change next time is I'll make a double batch!

This recipe is amazing.  I too was a little nervous of using baking spices but this is what makes the recipe.  My 4 year old doesn't like meat, or meat balls of any sort and told me tonight that this was the happiest her tummy has ever been.  And my 2 year old who is on a food strike finished his and then sat on my lap and finished mine!

First time making (and eating) Swedish Meatballs.  My hunny's favorite & he assured me they were good.  Followed the recipe as written with the brown sugar (didn't taste sweet) but did triple it as I was too lazy to divide up the meat.  When the kids ASK if there will be leftovers for dinner tomorrow, it's a good thing.

oh my yummy yum yum! I also made these with ground turkey, cut the nutmeg in half. They melted in your mouth. I didnt have beef broth so I used chicken broth and added 1/4 cup heavy creme to the gravy. Then when the balls were done, I put them directly into the gravy. right before serving, I folded in the sour creme. served over egg noodles they were divine.

Very good!  I made a few changes due to what I had on hand and saved a trip to the grocery store.  I used milk instead of cream, all chicken broth instead of beef broth, all ground beef.   I also cut back the  sour cream to aprox. 2 large dallops; we like the beefy taste.    The flavors was suble but I'd love to try this with the pork/beef mix next time!  Thx :)

This was amazing.  I have a secret.  My meat mixture was too wet/loose.  But, when I went for some breadcrumbs, I was out.  I thought, Hmmmm I have graham cracker crumbs.  Since I reduced the brown sugar per the reviews, I thought, why not?  I loved it!  Other than that I followed the recipe with  slight tweaks to proportions.  Raves all around.

I was really excited about trying this recipe, but the end result was not what I expected.  The meatball itself turns out great, as does the gravy, but it's the flavor that I don't care for.  If I were to take out the ginger, allspice and nutmeg I would have loved this recipe, but with those spices it just has a very odd flavor in my opinion.

The bread crumb mixture can be quite lumpy. I mixed bread crumbs and the cream about a minute before mixing in (solidifies otherwise!) and came out even better.

Excellent meatballs, very moist and flavorful. I made these just like the recipe stated except I put the meatballs in the crockpot instead of the oven. I let them cook for about 3 hours and they were perfect. I was suspicious of using the spices (allspice and nutmeg) that the recipe called for but I didn't notice them later. I served it over egg noodles. Most delicious!

best meatball recipe on this site...followed the recipe, as far as ingredients but not preparation. I was in a hurry and mixed everything together including grated raw onion instead of sauteing them. Happy to report I had great success. I did add an additional 1/4 tsp of allspice to the gravy to give it that subtle interesting flavor. Served with rice and watched it disappear off of everyone's plates.

Wonderful.  Made exactly as written.  Wasn't sure if it called for 4 or 8 ounces of sour cream....directions a bit confusing.  I went with 4 ounces and it was spot on.

THESE MEATBALLS ARE GOOD, BUT I PREFER A LITTLE MORE FLAVOR, SO I DOUBLED THE SPICES THE SECOND TIME I MADE THEM. I ALSO ADDED SOME NUTMEG AND ALLSPICE TO THE GRAVY.YUM! SERVED OVER NO-YOKES WITH STEAMED ASPARAGUS ON THE SIDE.

Delicious. We absolutely loved it. This is more than just plain meatballs. Although the 40 minutes cooking is too much. I did a little over 20 and they were great.

My husband has been bugging me to make Swedish Meatballs for literally years haha. He has this childhood memory of them. So I made these and they were AMAZING! The meatballs were soft and moist, the seasoning divine! The gravy was the icing on the cake, the sour cream completely changes it and makes it into something magical! I made this with egg noodles, within 10 minutes there were two meatballs left and a groaning husband. Thanks so much for sharing this!

I made the Swedish meatballs recipe and I didn't care for all the spices in it. It looked good but the flavor needed to be toned down. I will not make this recipe again.

This turned out fantastic! The meatballs were moist and the gravy was smooth and creamy.  I too was hesitant about using all of the different spices but it wasn't over powering or too sweet.  I served this with egg noodles and my husband loved it! I will definitely be serving this to family and friends.

Very good. Followed the recipe as recommended. The only thing I did different was I did not add the brown sugar. My son came back the next night to see if I had any leftovers. A couple of meatballs left for him to nosh on.

I've made these twice now, once exactly as written, and I'm thinking it still needs tweaking. I left out the onions altogether the second time, and I added some allspice to the sauce, but it still isn't quite what I'd like it to be. I do think I added too much salt to the sauce though... I used angel hair pasta as well, and I do like that. Egg noodles makes it too much like stroganoff for me (what with the sour cream in the sauce). I keep wondering if heavy cream would be a better replacement for the sour cream? I think the spices might need upped as well - they are really delicious with the beef/pork blend (and I just made them 1/2 pound each). I intend to keep playing with this recipe until I get it right!

I made this without the optional ingredients.  IT WAS PHENOMENAL!!!  The meatballs are fantastic.  The gravy was great, though I will probably use a little less sour cream next time.  Once it was finished, we split it into individual serving containers and froze it (without the noodles, so we could take them for lunches at work.  My husband hates frozen meals, and he hates leftovers, but he can't get enough of these.  I just make fresh noodles the night before, and it's a perfect lunch!

Excellent.  Great with wide egg noodles.  I would suggest being generous with the sauce when making it if you are serving over noodles--the noodles soak it up really fast.

PERFECT!!!  This is one of those reviews though that didn't do the recipe as written.  Allergies and not enough time. Substituted goat milk kefir for cream and sour cream and cooked all on stove top instead of baking.  FAMILY loved it!!!  Spices are especially yummy.

This was really good. Had to use half and half instead of sour cream and heavy cream and some whole wheat bread instead of white because that is all I had.  It was really good with the exception of the meatballs falling apart, but I think it was because the bread I used was a bit denser so it didn't bind well because of that.

This was great - my husband doesn't like swedish meatballs, so I was looking forward to eating all the leftovers myself, but he loved them.  So much for that plan - I had to share.

I would use more beef broth than two cups. It's better to have extra liquid as it is absorbed by the noodles. Other than that, it was great. I love the spices and would probably add more next time.

About a year ago, I made this exactly as written, but had to purchase the meats since we are hunters and usually only have venison present. This recipe was so delicious that I had to try it with venison, so the second time around, I used 2lbs of venison and replaced the cream with buttermilk (this eliminates any "gamey" taste from the venison). This recipe came out even better with the venison and buttermilk, in my family's opinion. I've read the reviews that say they would use less sour cream, but honestly, some of us loved that sour cream taste and some of us would have preferred it with a little less.... so it is really a personal taste kind of thing. I'm making this again tonight and plan to put sour cream on the table and allow people to add however much they prefer ;)

So good! Read the reviews before hand and used less sour cream in the end and it turned out amazing. Didn’t use ginger, as I didn’t have any and I used ground turkey meat instead. I can only compare them to IKEA meatballs and those pre-package seasonings at the store, but honestly, these are by far the best Swedish Meatballs I’ve ever had! Definitely adding this to my recipes to use again and again! I put them over Amish Egg noodles which were good, but I think I’d like this better with mashed potatoes, so next time we’ll try that route. Great Recipe!

I made this exactly as directed and I’m a good cook. The meatball mixture did not hold its shape and the “meatballs” were impossible to sauté. I added some breadcrumbs to the remaining mixture. It helped the texture a bit, but not enough. It’s Christmas Eve and my husband is on his way to Papa Murphy’s.

I will definitely Namur it again.  The meatballs were very sweet so I would not use the brown sugar. Also make a larger roux as I like a lot of gravy.

We loved it!  I had to make a few modifications but they turned out fabulous.  My changes: used all ground beef; forgot to add the egg (oops), used 1/4 c of heavy cream & 1/4 c. of almond milk; didn't have time to sauté up the onion so I used dried onion instead; and lastly, substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream!  Left out the brown sugar.  And the whole family had seconds.  Next time I'll need to double the recipe.

I loved this recipe! It tasted exactly how I was hoping it would. I made enough to have it over noodles one night and over yellow rice a couple days later (I personally liked it with rice a little better). I followed the recipe very closely, which is odd for me. The only changes: using saltines instead of bread (and omitting the added salt), adding a little cream and extra sautéed onion to the sauce just because I had them on hand, and because it was optional, I left out the brown sugar. The one snag I ran into while preparing the meatballs was that it was difficult to roll the balls, add them to the skillet, and keep turning them all at the same time. I had to call in a helper for that. I also may have undercooked the meatballs in the skillet. The recipe said to sauté them for five minutes, and I may have pulled them too quickly. They were still delicious. Oh! And it’s unclear from the recipe which pan drippings to use. I used both, and the sauce was excellent!

These were spectacular! My family and friends devoured them! I grew up eating Swedish meatballs at holidays, but this was by far the best recipe.

I did make a couple of changes
(1) I only used ground beef. - my family does not like ground pork.
(2) I sauteed fresh mushrooms in butter with salt and added it to the gravy as we served, as my family prefers mushrooms with their meatballs.

I did it with some alterations to cut calories. 2 parts nonfat greek yogurt with 1 part skim milk instead of heavy cream, low calorie bread, ground turkey over beef and pork, and greek yogurt again instead of sour cream. The meatballs were fantastic. Flavorful, cooked, and moist. Unfortunately, as turkey is low in fat, not many pan drippings were left, so the gravy wasn’t as flavorful. Not sure how to go about fixing that without using the traditional more fatty meats. I’ll probably make this again like this, but not bother with the gravy portion.

The meatballs were way too soft and there wasn’t enough gravy to go around. Two stars are for flavor, which was perfect. Next time I’ll make my own meatballs and use the spices from this recipe.

Well, I am a long time lurker of this fabulous site but this recipe was so dang good it compelled me to make an actual account and write an actual review. Never made swedish meatballs before but you better believe they will be made again and again in my home! So rich, so savory...so much love for this recipe! So, I must say I was out of brown sugar and had to sub in white sugar. I also was a little short on sour cream and had closer to maybe half of what the recipe asked for

Very good.  The meat mixture was a little too salty.  Don't let the bread crumbs sit more than a minute in the cream or it will be rock solid; I had to use a food processor to mix it together to avoid bread lumps.  Otherwise, it was very tasty. I will make it again.

tasted like shepherd's pie to me, though i followed the recipe, sauce tastes too much like canned mushroom soup. next day added sauteed onion & cremini mushrooms to leftovers which surprisingly helped. i'm not an expert on sweedish meatballs so dont know what they were supposed to taste like.

It's good, but not the best I've ever had. The meatballs are very good - I used panko breadcrumbs instead of bread, and added a bit of worcheschire sauce to the meat as I saw that in another recipe.  That part was great, but the sauce needs something - I'm not sure what. It's VERY rich so you may want to tweak it a bit. Personally I'd cut down on the sour cream next time. It definitely needs the sour cream, but less might be better. or perhaps light sour cream?
Next time I'm also going to top with fresh parsley, and probably add some  sautéed mushrooms too.

Sorry Nom Nom, but I disagree... this was NOT worth the effort. The taste was ok, but between the time it took plus the amount of pans, dishes, & bowls used for this recipe, it was just too much for me.

NO changes. It's wonderful, difficult to screw up. Can be doubled and tripled as needed. I served it with homemade spaetzle.  A matter of taste? I sprinkled the spices a bit more generously and sometimes people like extra sauce, so i increase the related liquid ingredients by 25% or 50%.

This recipe is outstanding!  I make it repeatedly and all the meatballs disappear.  Try to keep them small, double the sauce, cook some buttered egg noodles and get some lingonberry garnish.  Yeah, it takes forever to roll them up small.  Oil your hands, watch TV.

This recipe is an absolute joke!  I made it twice and followed exactly both times, and each time the meatballs fell apart. (The second time shouldn't have happened, but I didn't recognize it as the same one that failed the first time). The mixture is way too wet and mushy, and they do not hold together AT ALL.  I suggest using dry bread crumbs or less cream, although for some reason it was too mushy before I even added the cream soaked bread.  My guess is that it has something to do with the cooked onions, try putting them in raw.  Or better yet, dont waste your time or money on this recipe!  Needless to say, i was left with a pan of sloppy ground hamburger and a sink full of dirty dishes (one bowl to soak the bread, one bowl to mix the slop together, one pan to fry the onions, one pan to fry the meatballs, not to mention the utensils.  No idea why this has such a high rating.

First let me say if you know your family doesn't like a certain spice.... don't use it, and if your gravy is too thin for your taste.... by all means add some more flour.  I made this EXACTLY  only I doubled the recipe.  I even put in the brown sugar and ginger which made me very very nervous because others commented on how sweet it was (like a cupcake).  Mine was on the saltier side with the chicken broth it was baked in, but not too salty.  Anyway, I thought the flavors were unique, which was exactly what I wanted as this was being served with pappardelle pasta, and greek style string beans.  I did not want a regular Italian style meatball, which is pretty much what you have without allspice, nutmeg and ginger  I also tried a tip from another comment of adding the sour cream a little at a time and did it to our taste.  Loved it!  Thank you!

Excellent!  I added some cardamom with the ginger, allspice, and nutmeg.  Super yummy and rich!  I think the game changer is soaking the bread crumbs in the cream.

Excellent recipe! Substituted plain Greek yogurt for the sour cream, and omitted the brown sugar. Otherwise followed the recipe as written. Meatballs were moist and full of flavor. Gravy was delicious. My in laws, who are Swedish, and think the best Swedish meatballs come from IKEA, now appreciate truly exceptional moist, savory, Swedish meatballs as they should be made! This will become a regular part of our family fare.

Follwed recipe as directed except someone used my beef broth and had to use what I had which was a couple packs of brown gravy. After it was done I put the meatballs in the gravy on low until noodles were ready. A keeper!

So delicious! Saves us trips to IKEA (and my husband says they're better than the ones at IKEA anyways). My mother-in-law can't eat wheat, so I substituted the bread crumbs with some mashed taters. Turned out perfect! Very filling.

I noticed the meatballs are significantly sweeter when made with bread crumbs. So if you find they're too sweet, try the potato thing.

The pan sauce was a little bland; it needs its own shot of the nutmeg/allspice/ginger seasonings.

I made it exactly according to the recipe, and it was delicious.  My only change for next time would be to add something to spice up the gravy because it was a tad bland.  I would definitely make it again.

Was looking for something other than the Lipton Soup Swedish meatballs that I've made forever.  Followed exactly aside from upsizing the recipe using 2lbs beef and 1lb ground lamb and I deglazed the pan with some cab wine.   Awesome! And a big hit that will go into the regular rotation...  One other thing, I didn't cover meatballs in oven with foil, so they browned better.

I'd give it zero stars if possible. I followed the recipe as directed. The first batch, the balls fell apart even though I very carefully turned them. There is far too much moisture in the ingredients. The second batch, I added half a can of bread crumbs but it wasn't enough. It tastes bad too. No dinner tonight.  I grew up on Swedish meatballs. This isn't it.

These were absolutely fantastic! So good, that I registered on the site just so I could comment! I doubled the recipe and did and even 50/50 of the pork and beef. They came out phenomenal! Not many leftovers! I would suggest adding the sour cream to taste depending on how you like your gravy.

These were tasty. Perhaps my spices were old, but I didn't feel like I used enough. Once I put the sauce over everything, the meatballs lost their flavor. I will say that the meatballs were good on their own without the sauce.

Very good! Meatballs were excellent. Tasty sauce but not quite thick enough. I would add another Tbsp. of flour to the recipe. Recommend not firmly packing the brown sugar, just measure loose.

I was getting a little tired of the usual rotation (you know how it is). So I did a little searching to find a recipe for something that I've never made before and I came across this recipe.  
     I loved it, my husband loved it and even my 1.5 year old loved it. 
     I didn't  change the recipe any but I will admit that I'm not one to be too concerned with accuracy when measuring out ingredients, especially spices.  
     I served it over egg noodles and it reminded me of a beef stroganoff with a different flavor and a different type of meat.  I would recommend this recipe.

Good flavor -- even better the next day. A little work-intensive for me, but I tend to gravitate toward recipes with minimal prep for everyday meals. Still, a good meal for a cold winter's night.

Delicious! Only deviation was to use equal parts beef and pork.  Meatballs were delightfully tender and the gravy was oh so comforting.  Will use a tad bit less sour cream next time but otherwise a perfect recipe.  Thanks!

Delicious, one of our family favorites. Tastes just like what the church ladies made. Skip the brown sugar, or the gravy will be too sweet.

These are unbelievably delicious and I believe the combination of QUALITY ground beef and ground pork is the trick.  Guests could not get enough.  I always use Greek yogurt in place of sour cream because I always have it on hand.

Absolutely delicious! Like many previous reviewers, I too, was skeptical about the spices, but I followed the recipe closely (which is odd for me), and used the optional spices. I deviated slightly by using 1c panko and all lean ground beef (what I had on hand). Instead of all chicken broth, I did use 1/2 beef and chicken base (Better Than Bouillion brand). The meatballs turned out perfectly! The gravy, however, I tweaked a bit by adding the same spices used in the meat mixture (including the brown sugar). I also used a cornstarch slurry to thicken to the consistency I wanted.  After removing it from the heat, I briskly whisked in about 1/8c sour cream, tasting as I went. Perfect!! Husband asked me to definitely make again, and I wholeheartedly agree. It will absolutely remain on our fall/winter dinner rotation.

This dish is very good. I made it exactly as written except my meat came out to be 1.10 lb, and it yielded 20 meatballs. I think next time i will up the spices a little, as others have mentioned. I enjoyed the flavor, but I personally would like to take it up a notch. I also will brown the meatballs a little longer than 5 mins. as I felt like they were so tender, they could easily fall apart when tossing with noodles. I served it over a 12oz. bag of egg noodles, and the sauce came out to be the perfect amount for that. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

The meatballs were far too sweet for my palate.  However, my son loved them.  The only way I thought I would be able to eat was if I made an extremely rich sauce.  I did:  1 6 oz. container of plain yogurt, 2 c. half and half, 1/2 c. water and 2 Knorr Beef Stock concentrates.  The sauce was wonderfully rich.  I still could not eat the meatballs, BUT, my son has eaten nearly all of it!  I will make it again. . .for him.

I think these are the best Meatballs I've ever made. Recipe, was kinda disorganized and hard to follow so I suggest you read threw it and sort which ingredients go in the meatballs and which are for the sauce. It was a constant back and forth figuring out what goes where. Other than that, it was amazingly good! I made my meatballs the night before and put them in the fridge to make thing go a little faster the day I cooked.

This was amazing!  I followed the recipe, except for one thing.  I am low-carb dieting, so I substituted a little Diet Dr Pepper for the brown sugar. (like an ounce or two)  I also used Healthy Life bread, instead of regular white.
My husband is not usually very vocal when he likes something, but he was raving about this one.  He loved it, and told me, "I'll fight you for the last 4 meatballs." :)
I served it without any kind of starch.  Instead, I sautéed some zucchini and onions with a little butter and tomato vinegar.  Those were stellar, too!  Overall, a really GREAT meal. :)

Omg. Omg. Omg. Absolutely DELISHHHHHHH. I admit I was nervous making these with the spices. The way I make Swedish meatballs is not authentic but we all liked it. But I wanted to try a real authentic recipe. This is it!!! Followed to a tee except doubled it and didn't have ground ginger on hand (thought I did). If I had it, I would've used it. Anyway, came out totally outstanding. My family ate these up like the gavones that they are when they like a dish. A total keeper in my house. Will be adding to rotation. We loved this recipe. Thank you nom nom nom!!! Wonderful!

This was a hit.  The whole family proclaimed this a keeper.  Only a couple of changes...  I used all ground beef, (.that's all I had ) reduced the brown sugar to a teaspoon and I added 1/8 tsp of allspice to the gravy, because many reviews said it was bland. Next time, I'm doubling this recipe!

I did not like the meatballs.  They were to soft.  I could barely keep them together as they  were sauteing, plus I thought they were bland.  The sauce was pretty good though!

I doubled this recipe for Christmas dinner and kids and adults, enjoyed it alike.  I varied from the recipe only slightly, choosing not to add nutmeg or brown sugar and added only a dash of ginger.  The flavor from the spices is so slight, you would never know it was in there, if you hadn't read the recipe.  Maybe adding all the spices along with the brown sugar makes for the odd sweetness other reviewers have posted about?  If you're concerned with those flavors, leave them out all together or go conservative.  I don't think it would take away from the dish.  

In the description of this recipe, the author mentions putting this in the crock pot but gives no further instructions.  So, I winged it.  I prepared as above, placed meatballs in the crock pot, covered with gravy, and placed in the refrigerator overnight.  Christmas morning, I put it on low for 4 hours.  I didn't add the sour cream until about 15 minutes before serving just because I forgot to add it... and I served it over egg noodles.

My husband made this with ground venison and only used a 1/3 of a container (all we had left). It was fantastic! Our picky kids had multiple helpings. Definitely a guest-worthy meal! Thank you!

Delicious!!  I haven't been able to find a recipe as good as this in years. The meatballs are so tender & tasty, love the taste of the spices, just perfect.  This is the one I'll be keeping!!  I did however make a couple changes to the recipe,I substituded Philidelphia Cream Cheese for the cream in the meatballs, omitted the ginger & brown sugar.  I also added fresh mushrooms to the gravy.

Very good. The boys in this household couldn't get enough. Had one teenager who even took them cold with his school lunch. Easy to put together and the gravy was easy too. Not too time consuming just a little but most great old fashion dishes are. Will make over and over.

Delicious. Used ground turkey because I had it in the freezer. I would reduce the seasoning a tad next time. Very strong. The gravy was excellent. I used Swanson's new beef broth "flavor booster" (very concentrated), added about 8 oz of mushrooms (wanting to add a veg to the dinner and taking this cue from stroganoff) and served over "no yolks" "egg" noodles, which taste the same to me! Only regret is that I didn't have lingonberries on hand! Will plan better next time! Also served with Danish sweet and sour red cabbage. Yum.

These were awesome and actually tasted like swedish meatballs! The only problem I had was this: the sour cream, when added, didn't completely integrate with the rest of the gravy. I had little white specs in my gravy. It still tasted delicious and I'm not particularly picky about presentation for family meals, so I'll definitely make this again. It was truly excellent over some boiled rice :)

This is the real thing. You can adjust spices and serving options to your own tastes,however, as a  base recipe this one is as good as it gets. I have not tasted better and it reminds me of my days as a child. Congrats, you nailed this one.

Overall a good meatball recipe, but WAY heavy on the onions. I only used 1/2 of an onion and it was still too much. I had a hard time keeping the meatballs together because of all the onions. Plus, they didn't digest very well (if you get my drift). Use only 1/4 of an onion, finely diced, add some veggies, serve over egg noodles, and it's a great family meal.

Incredible recipe. Thank you for posting this. I only had chicken stock on hand and used that. Still turned out amazing. The meatballs were incredible. I used rice instead of noodles. My fiancé loved it too.

Delicious, I made this meal last night; it rivals Ilea’s Swedish meatballs.  Although the prep time, for me, was longer, I still had the meal completed in 2 ½ hrs. I served it on buttered egg noodles, baked red potatoes and a dollop of red raspberry preserves.

This was a pretty good...unusual to cook swedish meatballs (not svenska kottbullar, but svensk köttbullar - "svenska" means Swedish language; kött, or koett, is "meat" and bullar is "balls") in chicken broth, so I ommitted this step and just baked them. Also replaced the cream with milk for making the meatballs.  Otherwise quite decent! Not sure if I will make it again except for special occasions since the meat itself costs more than a kg of pre-made ones at the store here haha.

I think I used the wrong kind of bread because I wasn’t able to make meatballs. It was more like clumps of tasty ground meat.. but the flavor was amazing and I’ll be making this again!

I made this recipe with my mother-in-law for Christmas dinner and it was fantastic! My husband is a very picky eater and he loved it! We used oatmeal instead of bread crumbs because that is what my mother-in-law preferred and we omitted the ginger. My picky eater husband does not like sour cream so we omitted that in the gravy. It all turned out fabulous!

My Grandmother was from Sweden and made the best Swedish meatballs, ever!  I couldn't locate the old recipe, and this looked like the closest.  (I figured with a name like Svenska, I couldn't go wrong!)  They were just as delicious as my Grandmother's!  Thank you!!!!  I think they key is the bread soaked in cream.    The gravy was also quite good.  (Adding mushrooms to the gravy is a nice touch, if you feel so inclined!)

This Italian  lady  who makes meatballs by the ten-pound tubful was absolutely stunned by the family's reaction!  I made these using the recipe, including the optional ingredients and they were wonderful.  I wouldn't dare to tell my grandma, though.

Loved the flavors, huge hit with my family. Next time I will just bake these meatballs first in the oven, instead of browning on the stove. Then move to the step with the sauce.

I used only beef for the meatballs, and left out the allspice. For the gravy I used chicken broth and sprinkled in a touch of paprika. We paired the dish with wilted spinach and it was a perfect addition. My husband was blown away. This will be a family recipe for years!

Review is for the *Meatballs Only*

Adjustments I made: 
Used only fresh ground beef.  No pork.
No sugar.  No ginger.

I used store bought plain bread crumbs instead of stale crumbled bread. 

Meatballs were added into gravy to finish cooking rather than placed in oven so no chicken broth was needed. 

The meatballs were so moist and tender but they did not fall apart after chilling for an hour before cooking them. I'll use this recipe and vary the seasonings for different meatball recipes, too (I'm imagining kofta seasonings for pita sandwiches, italian seasonings for spaghetti, etc).  Very delicious meatballs.

We did have Swedish meatballs for dinner but I used a more traditional gravy recipe.  The recipe as is seemed to be more of a bare bones meatballs stroganoff recipe than anything else.

DELICIOUS!  Followed the recipe exactly with exception of amount of sour cream in sauce.  I read reviews before making and halved the amount.  I like a meatier sauce and would next time reduce the sour cream to 1/4 cup.  Fantastic recipe and even picky kid loves.  Served over egg noodles.

Absolutely wonderful. I made a triple batch. The meatballs were absolutely amazing even without sauce.  The sauce was so much better the second day. Suggest making a day prior then heating in a crock pot the day you want it.

I made this recipe EXACTLY as written. Now I have never like meatballs, but these are the best I have ever had, and my boyfriend loves them and has asked for them again next week. They freeze well if you decide to double  the recipe and you definitely should. Try the recipe as is before tweaking it you will be pleasantly surprised!

I didn't have ground pork, so I used a pound of ground beef.  I didn't have chicken broth, so I used all beef broth. 
These were excellent over fettuccine.  My family loved this dish, we'll definitely make it again.

Absolutely delicious!! We used the meatballs for spaghetti and they tasted incredible. Looking forward to using with the brown sauce. I tripled the recipe and froze the extras. Happy to have found a great recipe for meatballs for my growing boys to eat as a healthy lunch or after school snack.

Pretty tasty, with a flavour very reminiscent of tourtière. And just like meat pie, very rich, so don’t eat too much at once. I will be making these again, probably at Christmas.

This recipe is very very good. I have always been intimidated to make homemade meatballs. These are so easy. I used the spices except I was out of ginger (darn it) The spices made these meatballs over the top delicious . It doesn’t call for a lot of salt, but for some reason these tasted on the salty side. Next time, and there will be a next time I will omit the salt. We served these over noodles. I will double the gravy next time, as it was sooo good. Thank you for sharing.

Just absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe as is with all optional ingredients except I used 2% milk in lieu of cream. I doubled the recipe and correct, there are very few leftover!! Definitely making these from now on when I can allocate the time

I love this meatball recipe.  The only thing I did differently was the gravy. I used my store brand’s (Meijer) country gravy packet mix.  The meatballs and this gravy are so good together. I served it on whipped potatoes. My go to comfort food recipe.

Except for using a 50/50 beef/pork ratio, I made the meatballs just as directed (I did leave out the optional sugar). They were amazing. Even the picky kid ate five. Pretty sure we took years off our lives, but it was worth it.

These were really good, but a lot of work! I did quadruple the recipe for a large family gathering, so that added to my work. I missed the direction on the size (1 1/2 T), so mine were huge (more like 4-5 T). They still cooked up great and were a hit.

I figured I would like this recipe, but I did not expect to love it! I wasn't sure about all those spice combinations...but I followed it, including the optional spices. The taste was amazing! Very flavorful and savory. I used a combination of ground beef, pork, and turkey. I also used bread crumbs instead of the white bread. I didn't bother with frying the meatballs, I used a 1 ounce scoop and placed them on a baking sheet and baked them for 35 minutes or so. The meat ball was so moist and soft. It had great texture and flavor. My family really enjoyed this for dinner.

Great recipe. Mix was very wet and hard to keep together while browning. Wished I had made more soaked bread to add as needed. However, they sere so moist and tender. Yum! Also the only meatballs I've found that comes close to my Swedish grandmother's. Thanks.

I did make changes! But used the meatball recipe all in. I did bake on 375 for 15 minutes. My gravy was a large can of mushroom soup -and 8 oz of heavy cream. And beef broth.! Added allspice and nutmeg for ore flavor. My adult kids loved it. A+ all the way around!

Meatballs were great. I included the optional brown sugar and ginger and that made them a little sweeter than the ones I remember my grandma making. Next time, I will omit those 2 optional ingredients and try it not as sweet. Very delicious meatball and the gravy was easy to make (and for some reason I’m scared of gravy) and tasty.

This recipe took well over 2 hours to make from start to finish. It's labor-intensive and by the time dinner was ready to eat, I was exhausted and there wasn't a single flat area in the kitchen that wasn't covered with dirty pots, pans, and dishes. 

The meatballs and sauce were good ... but certainly not good enough to warrant all the time and effort that went into making them.

Legitimately food crack. Not sure I've ever tasted anything so delicious in my life. I could have easily eaten batches of the meatballs just by themselves. I used turkey to cut calories and thought chicken broth for the gravy might compliment that but I think beef broth would have actually tasted better. Tossed some white wine vinegar in the gravy for some extra flavor as well, not that it really needed any. We had some left over red onion so I used that instead of yellow, which I highly recommend the sweetness of the onion compliments this recipe wonderfully. Despite all of my modifications this recipe is still great as-is which is why I'm still rating it highly, I just thought my changes were still worth noting if anyone ever wants to change things up!

Ouch! Prepared as directed. Unfortunately, not a fan at all.  Not sure which spice pushed me over the edge, ginger, all spice, or nutmeg. I really wanted to like this recipe, as I'm always looking for the perfect flavor; but so disappointed. As i love the "Best Ever Meatloaf" recipe here on this website, I think next time I make meatballs, I'm going to use that recipe.

Meat mixture was a bit loose, so I added another slice of crumbled, toasted bread.   I added the optional ginger.  I use very fresh spices so the flavor and fragrance are strong, which I prefer.  Just keep in mind if your spices are ancient, that is, several years old, etc., you won't get the same results.  Also, you have to vary the oven temp, depending on ovens and how long you brown them.  Convection oven only took 20 minutes.  In the end, less is more if you want a soft meatball, go for a little pink as they keep cooking while they sit.  I  put the meatballs in the dish with the sauce and  heated up on the stove before transferring to a serving dish.  My family likes it better without the sour cream .  I also make a variety of these where I add red wine and reduce to cook out the alcohol.  Just takes a little practice to get them the way you like.

I will definitely be making this again. It was delicious and while I was hoping for a taste like the Banquet meals I wasn't disappointed despite it not tasting the same.

I followed the recipe but added organic pea shoots because I didn't have any parsley. I fried the meatballs in a little butter then removed them and then deglazed the pan with one  envelope of Bovril and water added a little cornstarch to thicken then took it off the heat and added the cream 1/2 and 1/2 and placed the meatballs in a casserole dish and poured the sauce over to let it stand overnight ,I plan to serve with egg noodles (german style. it was easy and the gravey taste's delicious.

2/24/19:  Really good, but it has a very mild flavor.  I might try to bump up the spice next time.  I served this with egg noodles, but I might make mashed potatoes next time.  Also, I used breadcrumbs instead of bread, and letting it sit with the cream longer than 10 minutes made it super hard.  Don't let the bread crumbs sit with the cream until I'm ready to add it to the rest of the mix.

I made it for the very first time at 65, and I am so pleased I did. My family liked it a lot and they are very picky eaters. I increased the allspice because I love it and added 2 beef bouillon cubes to the gravy and it turned out wonderful and I was worried because I don't have a very good track record with gravy.  Oh, I did have enough meatballs for another dinner as I increased the beef and added pork so I froze them right from the pan and will try to make gravy for them the next time from scratch. Loved the recipe. Thank you Nom Nom.

Excellent! Meat balls are very tender and great flavor. Have made twice, the second time I added chopped mushrooms & made a 50/50 mixture of sausage & hamburger. The first time I added some ground turkey burger to hamburger. Just a little variation.

I made s couple changes.  Used bread crumbs from a can and added more beef broth make more gravy.  Once the meatballs were done in the oven, I put them in the pan if gravy.  Btw I also used the same skillet to make the gravy that I used to cook the meatballs.

These were so great! I used ground pork and turkey(we don’t buy beef) The sauce and meatballs are so good. I was using several different recipes to get the Swedish meatball dish I wanted. This is so much better. It is more work than my usual bake and then add them to a sauce, but it is sooooo worth it.

I loved this.  I had to make one substitution because on Super Bowl Day, I didn't have sour cream.  Really?  Who does that?  So, I used a half cup of full-fat greek yogurt.  I really didn't notice any harm from this so yippee!  I served this with gravy and lingonberry sauce on the side for toothpick served meatballs for game day.

I agree with a previous reviewer, the prep time is off, however, I knew that so started earlier.  I minced the onion very fine and nuked with a tablespoon of butter in the microwave for about 2 minutes.  I did not use the brown sugar, didn't seem right to me.  Other than that I followed the receipe except I made the gravy in the same pan I browned the meatballs in, saved on cleaning another pan.  We loved it!   Served it with mashed potatoes and oven roasted fresh brussel sprouts.  I almost forgot, as per another reviewer, I added a pinch of allspice to the gravy, YUM.

Who knew that adding nutmeg to meatballs would be a world of difference? I sure didn't, but I have been adding nutmeg to them ever since. This is an easy recipe that's tastes delicious. I use it now whenever I make Swedish Meatballs, never forgetting the nutmeg. 

I have discovered though that I like just the plain breadcrumbs instead of using slices of old bread, just a personal preference.

I made this with ground turkey  (since we do not eat beef or pork) and included the optional ginger.  The other deviation, is that rather than transfer the meatballs to another dish, I baked them in the pan in which they were browned to provide additional depth to the drippings. For the gravy, I made a butter rue and then added the cooking liquid along with chicken broth and sour cream.  My husband and I loved the dish.  It was excellent!

My mom has made this for years. When she passed no one knew what her recipe. Found this recipe and just tweaked the meatballs a bit. Followed the recipe but then added some Lawerys season salt, milk and salt and they were so flavorful!!  Then made it again a week later.

I didn't like the nutmeg in the meatballs, seemed like a little too much. Also the bread & cream mixture turned out way too hard, needed more cream.

My meatballs fell apart, they were too soggy but maybe it was because I used ground turkey. They tasted good though.

This was AMAZING!!! I only used ground beef because we didn't have ground pork that wasn't Italian (that would not compliment this dish at all). I added 2 cloves of garlic to the onions when I sauteed and only added a pinch of nutmeg instead of 1/4 tsp. They were a huge hit with my boyfriend and 4 yr old son. I will definitely be making them again!

Best dang Swedish meatball I've ever made!  Made exactly as written (including the optional ingredients).

The sauce/gravy, I did make some changes:  I used about 3X's more chicken stock to braise the meatballs and then strained and added it to the gravy.  It had collected a lot of flavor from the meatballs and deepened the flavor of the gravy.

Served this for New Year's dinner along with traditional lingonberry jam, mashed potatoes and oven roasted brussel sprouts.  Too yummy for words.  Thank you for another "go-to" recipe.  I wish I'd taken a picture because they were picture perfect.

I can tell that this recipe is perfect, but since I cheated and purchased premixed meatball mix at a Scandinavian market in Minneapolis, I can't really give it a 5.  I used all the cooking directions, and my meatballs turned out round, tasty, and good enough to leave the family wishing they had room for more!

Delicious! We tweaked the recipe, added a bit more of all the spices and fresh cilantro, and made a fennel and garlic based white sauce. We also used a veggie based broth instead of meat broth in the sauce, and added yogurt instead of sour cream. It really intensified the flavors. We also did not soak the breadcrumbs in milk. We served it with a green apple fennel salad with roasted squash.

I can't tell you how many times I've made Swedish Meatballs. (A LOT OF TIMES!) but this one is the best!  Loved it so much. My family gobbled it up and asked if it was a different recipe. The only thing I did different was I used chicken broth for the entire sauce, only because I didn't have beef broth on hand.  made xtra xtra gravy because my family loves their meatballs with lots of sauce. 

If you have any doubts, please don't hesitate. This one is REAL GOOD!

I didn't use the nutmeg or brown sugar, but made everything according to recipe.  I doubled it to make for a family dinner.  Very moist and delicious.  Loved it. Served over egg noodles.  If making again, would make more sauce as there was not enough sauce for the noodles.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent meatball recipe. Every other time I’ve made meatballs they’ve fallen apart but these kept their shape when Cooking. Also, tasted great! Lots of flavor. May try this recipe sometime as a meatloaf, to cut out a lot of the work.

I never make my Swedish meatballs any other way. I do put extra bread from a baguette and dry it in the oven if it isn't day old or slightly stale. I always make extra sauce and put them over egg noodles and I also double the recipe because I take my time making them and they are devine.

Love love love this recipe. The meatballs were so tender and full of flavor. The gravy was outstanding. I added a little white wine to the gravy and included drippings from fry pan. The entire family enjoyed this recipe. It’s a keeper.

These are super tasty with the seasoning combo but I love a spicy kick so I used the spicy Jimmy Dean sausage in place of regular ground pork...YUM YUM!  I did double the gravy as nobody likes a dry noodle!

Delicious!! Tripled the recipe to feed my husband and 3 teenage grandsons.  They all raved about it.  I used a little less sour cream as suggested by several reviewers.  It was so good that we’ve decided it will be on the menu for Christmas Eve dinner this year.

This is a great Swedish meatball recipe. The only change I made is to use half beef broth and half canned beef consume diluted as directed, when making the gravy. Gives a richer gravy. The meatballs come out fabulous.

This recipe is as authentic Swedish meatball as they come.  Only difference in how I was taught was to add coffee.  This recipe takes a little experience to make. Also, The meatballs need to cook slowly and not be turned until they have been cooked through partially or they will fall apart.   If your meatball mixture is mushy to begin with, then adjust it by adding more bread crumbs or add liquid a little at a time.  Easy.  Also, you can use yogurt instead of sour cream.  I use 1/2 and 1/2 or buttermilk.   Don't blame the recipe if it fails.  Blame the cook.

I've done this recipe many times in bulk batches, and it's always been terrific. Using freshly ground or grated whole spices will make a big difference (especially whole dried ginger, if you've never tried it!) and truly impress your dinner guests. The amount of sour cream in the sauce can certainly be reduced for those who feel it's too much, but super-low-fat creams should be avoided.
And though it's not authentic, I like to use panko for bread crumbs and add a tablespoon or two of ground mushrooms to the sauce.

My meatballs were delicious.  They were cooked in the oven on a heat resistant rack over a baking sheet pan.  I used both heavy cream and a small amount of sour cream for the gravy. It was a hit.

I tripled the recipe.  Except for adding additional allspice and nutmeg to the meatballs and sprinkling some in the sauce I followed the recipe. Wound up with about 90 meatballs, great easy dish for a family dinner.

So delicious! I used milk instead of heavy cream and 2 TBSP of dried minced onions instead of fresh, and it turned out great. The flavor of the spices blend together really well. I think this is my new favorite dish.

I did not add pork. The family loved it! They are hard to please. It needs a caution on salt levels as it can get close to too salty if you salt your potatoes. I usually add 1 tsp of salt to about 7 medium potatoes.

Just what I remember from my Swedish Covenant Church potluck days.  I wondered if I would ever find this flavor again!  The only changes I made were necessary due to what I had on hand.  I did not cook the onions first, because my husband likes them raw (I know - they cooked anyway - but I love him).  I used 1 can of consomme and water to make the two cups of beef broth.  I found the mixture very soft -but the consistency when finished was perfect.  Thank you!!!
Will make these again and again, I am sure!!!

Really loved the meatballs but the gravy was lacking something for me.

I followed the directions exactly and these were awesome.  The gravy was creamy and the meatballs moist.  My husband loved them and my sister in law went back for seconds (which she never does)  Will be making these again soon!

The kids LOVED it (the 7-year-old had a second helping)!  My husband and I liked it very much.  The meatballs seemed a bit too loose as I was rolling them, but they turned out beautifully - only needed 30 minutes in the oven.

Followed  recipe to a “T” and it was good, but not as flavorful as anticipated. Don’t discard pan drippings after cooking meatballs in skillet, save them for the sauce! Severed over egg noodles and OK but left me longing for more flavor.

My family really enjoyed these meatballs and the gravy is very tasty! I only used 1 piece of bread, 2 tbsps of 5% cream, omitted the salt and sugar, used 1/8 tsp each nutmeg and allspice for the meat mixture. My #50 scoop made 18 meatballs. I used beef broth for cooking the meatballs. I also sauteed some mushrooms and garlic then added the pan drippings and flour to make the roux. I used a heaping tbsp of sour cream as that was creamy enough for us. I added more flour to thicken the gravy a bit more and added some pepper to taste.

This is my favorite recipe! I always triple the recipe. I have seen some people say they leave out the chicken stock but I feel it helps keep the meatballs moist while they are baking. Even though I triple the recipe, I don't triple the chicken stock. I also always use the "optional" ingredients. Made this for my Swedish husband on our first date, he loves them!

Excellent and authentic, pretty identical to my Grandma's recipe. I double everything and use freshly grated nutmeg and I grate my onions and add them to the raw meat mixture saving a cooking step.  I also brown the meatballs in my cast iron pan or Dutch oven, deglaze pan with 1 can chicken broth, add meatballs back, cover and bake 40 min @ 350. Remove meatballs and make gravy in the same pan with all the juices and fond from the pan.  They are traditionally served with mashed potatoes and lingonberries but I usually do egg noodles or pappardelle pasta.

Yum! This brought me back to my childhood when my Nana Olsen would make these for my brother and me. She had no recipe to follow and would just whip these up for us. I watched her make these so I knew this recipe was close to her meatball recipe.
Thank you for bringing back a wonderful childhood memory! These were delicious. I skipped placing them in chicken broth and the oven for 40 mins. I put them in the oven while I made the gravy and they were done.

Very tasty, I plan on making a bunch more and freezing them to use when I make spaghetti.  I did add a half a teaspoon of cayenne to spice it up a bit more.

I was worried about the meat being too loose/wet as I was forming the meatballs but I just went with it.  These were fantastic!!  I will make them again (and again)!

Best Swedish meatballs I’ve ever had! Thank you for the recipe. 
I changed a couple of things based on what I had on hand. I used a 50/50 blend of beef and pork, milk instead of cream, multigrain instead of white bread, and beef instead of chicken broth. These received rave reviews from the family. Will definitely make them again!

My husband made this tonight. He made the recipe as is and said he wouldn't change anything. A few things to mention...he said the meatballs were a bit soft and hard to handle before cooked. I recommend trying to mix the meat up a bit early and leave it in the 'frig for an hour to firm up a bit for easier handling. The recipe was a bit confusing in the statement of "1/2 (8 ounce) container of sour cream". We took the "8 ounce" to mean the size of the container and used 4 ounces (1/2 cup) and it was perfect. I can see though, where someone might mistake this to mean the amount to use is 8 ounces. Could be where all the reviews saying 'there was too much sour cream' are coming from. It really should be written more clearly.

These were SO SO good!!  I didn’t have Allspice so that’s the only thing I didn’t use!  Also, I used dried onion flakes instead of fresh onion so it didn’t over power the flavor for my kids’ sake!  The texture turned out so tender. The bread and heavy cream are the secret to the texture. Don’t change that part!! I used Bob Evans original sausage with the ground beef. Seriously delicious!!  My kids loved them!!

I doubled this recipe and used 1lb each of pork and ground elk (this made enough meatballs for a family of 4 to eat twice, and two kids to take some for lunch one day) I left out the optional items and it was awesome. Some of the best gravy I have ever tasted. Kids were fighting over who was going to get to take meatballs for lunch, and everyone said I should make it once a week.

This was delicious! I had to use only ground beef as that was all I had and these meatballs were still very tender, because of the panade (bread and milk mixture). I had to add a little more flour to thicken, but the gravy was delicious! I was lazy and instead of browning the meatballs in a skillet I tried roasting them in the oven at 425 first, but next time I will brown in the skillet.

Friggin AMAZING!  My husband wouldn’t even talk during dinner because he was too busy eating.  I totally messed up & switched where you are supposed to use sour cream and heavy cream but it was ok.  Also I don’t know how to make the gravy without having balls of flour so I scooped those out so it wouldn’t be lumpy.  I’m almost positive I just don’t know how to whisk things in correctly though.  My toddler was not a fan but I think he just didn’t like the onion in the meatballs.  I would think you could omit those and they would still be delicious.

Absolutely loved this recipe! I made it a few weeks ago. I have tried a few different recipes and this was by far the best. I only made the meatballs with this recipe, not the gravy. The gravy I used is further down in the review. I omitted the onions since I’m not a fan, and used a 1/2 pork 1/2 beef mixture instead of what the recipe calls for. I also used half a cup of ready bread crumbs instead of 2 slices of day old bread. I used all the spices in this recipe. For the gravy, I used the McCormick Swedish Meatball seasoning and sauce (but only the sauce pouch) and put about 1/2 of the pan drippings into the gravy as it was simmering. Delicious! Served over egg noodles. I’m now in the process of making it again for dinner tonight!

These were delicious! Only change is next time I'll reduce the salt, they were a bit too salty. I serve them with Concord grape jelly.

Perfect, perfect, PERFECT. These taste exactly like what I want when I want Swedish meatballs. The meatballs were perfectly tender and the sauce was like velvet. These are worth every second of the cook time.

This was delicious.  Being Italian background, we are used to those types of flavors.  I wanted to branch out and try something different.   I didn't put the brown sugar in and added about 1/2 of the amount of spices it called for; I was bit apprehensive about a strong nutmeg or allspice flavor in the meatballs.  Otherwise, followed the recipe as written.  Meatballs were very tender, actually falling apart in skillet while browning.   But who cares, meatballs and sauce were savory and yummy.  Served over spaetzle.   Will definitely make again!!

I love this recipe just as it is written. However, my son loves meatballs, so when I make this I do try to make it a little healthier by using wheat bread, milk in place of cream, and I add about a quarter cup shredded zucchini to the meat mixture (I sauté it with the onions). When I make the sauce I add chopped browned mushrooms.  It still tastes great.

Excellent meatballs.  The white bread crumbles that absorbed the heavy cream made the dish. Before, I'd always used milk. The cream with bread really makes the difference. Next time I make it,  I may double the bread and cream. Served over noodles with petite peas. Yum!

I've made these dozens of times, both as written or using all beef when I have no pork on hand. Marvelous either way. I've tripled for guests, I've fed my exceptionally picky kids - I have yet to find someone who doesn't enjoy these. Simple to make, I love that they finish cooking in the oven. We usually serve over egg noodles. Awesome recipe!

This was pretty good and I would make it again. A little too much on the sweet spices, I think, and I didn't even add the brown sugar. I did add the ginger but I doubt that had much impact since it was only 1/8 tsp. I put mine over egg noodles. Looking forward to leftovers!

I doubled the recipe using 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound ground pork.  Although the spices seemed strange for savory meatballs, I used all the spices with the exception of allspice as I didn't have it. I only used 1/2 of the brown sugar.  I also didn't have 'day old bread', so I used Panko bread crumbs instead (1 cup x2 for doubled recipe).  I soaked the crumbs in the cream, but then they were lumpy.  Next time I'll add the cream to the meat and sprinkle the meat with the bread crumbs--no soaking.  I  tempered my sour cream with some of the gravy before adding it to the gravy.  I had difficulty getting the gravy to thicken, so also had to add a cornstarch slurry (about 3-4 teaspoons)  to get it to thicken.  I used unsalted beef broth, so added some beef base to add more beef flavor and salt to the gravy.  Even though I ran into some problems with the original recipe, I'm glad I stuck with it, because my son & husband RAVED about the results.  The meatballs & gravy were delicious!  Since I ended up using the same pan that I browned the meatballs to make the gravy, some of the spices crept into the gravy which we really liked.  It was labor-intensive, and took closer to 2 hours to make, but the overall meal was definitely 5-star!

This recipe is so amazing! Meatballs are kind of a pain for a work night so I decided to give swedish meatloaf a whirl. Best idea ever. I followed the measurements exactly but instead of making meatballs and browning in a saucepan, I put the mixture in a loaf pan, baked for 45 minutes with foil, 15 minutes without foil, and then 4 minutes with my oven set to broil. I told my husband this is my new favorite meal. The flavor is beyond amazing!!

This is a very tasty alternative to  Italian style meatballs. I find that making the meatballs is more hassle than its worth so I buy them pre-made. I have used beef, turkey and venison, all with great results. Instead of having the lovely spices in the meatballs, I mix it with the flour for the gravy, which I make in the skillet I've browned the meatballs in. Other than those changes I make it as per the recipe, thanks for sharing it!!!

Really liked this recipe, but will make a few changes next time:  will use 1 tsp of sugar, not 1 Tbsp - just too sweet for me.  I also will use 1 1/2 cup of beef broth - It was very thin gravy and was way too much anyway.  And finally, as others have mentioned, half the sour cream.  I may also cut back on the cream - my meat mixture was pretty sticky and hard to form meatballs.  Flavor overall was great and reminded me of Grandma's dinners.

I HAVE MADE THESE MEATBALLS A NUMBER OF TIMES. THE MEATBALLS ARE YUMMY. I PERSONALLY DO NOT LIKE THE GRAVY AS WRITTEN; I OMIT THE SOUR CREAM NOW, AFTER I TRIED IT WITH THE SOUR CREAM  AND DIDN'T LIKE IT AT ALL.

I will definitely make it again because the meatballs were delicious, even though I didn't have any pork. I didn't plan far enough ahead, so I didn't have beef broth, either, so I had to use cream of mushroom soup. That about killed me to do, but I was desperate. Despite that, this is a really good recipe, and I'm going to make it again SOON.

Absolutely wonderful dinner that my entire family loved! I've  made it several times with the optional brown sugar and ginger, used an organic beef broth with less sodium than most, about 3 oz of sour cream, and served it over egg noodles. I also recommend doubling the recipe, making it ahead of time, and serving the next day. Truly heavenly!

Great recipe! Definitely authentic! 
I did adjust 2 things:
1. Squeeze the milk/cream out of the bread crumbs a bit to get a firmer meatball.
2. Add a 1/4 tsp. of each of the spices (that are used in the meatballs) in the sauce.  
My family loved this recipe and event the little ones ate it with gusto! Thank  you for sharing!

Gravy needs salt. I used 2 tbls of butter.  Still had to thicken with a little corn starch.

Fantastic recipe! I usually tweak, but didn't do many adjustments on this one because it was so good. I doubled the salt and halved the sour cream. I was a little skeptical about adding the assorted baking-type spices, but went for it and am SO glad I did. GREAT ADDITION. Will definitely make this again.

Great recipe! Made a double batch but it still disappeared. I used Ritz crackers for the breading as it was the only thing I had on hand. Used all chicken stock as I personally think it tastes better. Next time I'm going to try to just cook the meatballs on the stove so a step can be eliminated.

Instead of using partial pork in the recipe I used all beef and it still turned out incredible! There are quite a few steps but it is delicious!

Made this last night for my book club. We had read a Swedish book so I figured this would go with the theme perfectly. They were delicious and very well received. The only change I made was to use  panko  instead of the bread.  I also added some freshly grated nutmeg to the sauce.  If you use the panko, do not let it sit with the cream for 10 minutes. It will be way too hard and will not blend in nicely with the other ingredients when it is time to mix it all together. I learned that the hard way but they still came out great. Served the meatballs over buttered noodles with toasted bread crumbs. Yummy!  Thank for a delicious recipe and I look forward to making it again.

I made it with turkey as it was what I had on hand.  I would like to try it again with the beef/ pork that is called for.  I think that  would have made the gravy pop.   My turkey didn't leave enough drippings to sufficiently flavor the gravy.   WIll make this again.

These meatballs are perfect. I used only ground beef and doubled the sauce; other than that, stuck to the recipe. These are the Swedish meatballs for me!

Edited to add: I usually just use half and half, rather than cream, and it's just as good. I make these pretty frequently, and still say these are the very best Swedish meatballs.

I made it per directions adding the optional ingredients. 
I don't eat pork, so the meat was 1/2 beef, 1/2 turkey. The flavoring was perfect and mild- not too over the top. I might try adding 1/4 tsp clove like my mother's recipe next time. This was extremely delicious to me- and i'm not a big meat eater. I read the reviews- do not be afraid to add the brown sugar or the ginger- I used light brown (what I had in the cabinet) and dried ground ginger. I couldn't even detect any overpowering sweetness or spiciness. I also added a dash of all the spices into the gravy.
I made tiny balls and cooked as directed. It came out very tender and super tasty. I will definitely make again for special occasions. I will serve them Christmas eve with the Lingonberries I found in my local grocer- which is surprisingly Delicious and a perfect accompaniment.  I can't wait to see how it goes over at our party! Thanks! Great recipe!

This is, as other reviewers have noted, a delicious "comfort-food" recipe that pleases almost everyone.  I did not find it too sweet or difficult to assemble.  I stuck with all the ingredients as written-- one step I omitted was browning the meatballs on the stovetop.  Any meatball recipe can be made in the oven and will brown them nicely if you give the pan a shake midway during baking.  I baked them for 25 min at 400 and they were perfectly tender.  I then poured the rendered fat into my pan on the stovetop to make the sauce, which was delicious.  Do not skip on the allspice and nutmeg-- they are awesome with the sour cream!  Will make again!

These meatballs had an amazing flavor!  I used Breadcrumbs instead of bread and added them as well as the cream to the meat mixture.  I just kind of guessed as to how much breadcrumbs to add. The meatballs were very mushy and delicate, but very wonderful.  I thought the sauce was okay .  I think that next time, I will try beef stock, and either add some worceshteshire sauce or sherry to take the sauce up a notch.  These meatballs had an amazing Flavor!

These are great! Made these per directions first and then I made a few changes, not to the recipe for the meatballs, but to cooking and gravy (I left out sugar and  keep in all spices, including ginger). I kept meatballs in pan on stove and cooked them in a small amount of stock (I've used beef and chicken). When fully cooked (maybe 15 minutes), I removed the meatballs and made the gravy. I added on sour cream in slowly, because we thought it was a bit too thick and creamy. Oh, also used toasted bread instead of day old.

So delicious! I took a tip from other reviewers and used all the optional ingredients even though I was skeptical, and cut down on the sour cream (used 1/4 of a 8oz container instead of 1/2), and added a pinch of allspice into the gravy as well. Served it over egg noodles- amazing!! I also misread the directions and put the beef broth and the drippings together too soon, so I ended up making the roux with 3 Tbsp butter, and who knows that might have even made the gravy more delicious! This one is a keeper!

So delicious! I've lost track of the number of times I've made this, it's become a favourite in my family, people get sad if I don't make it often enough. I usually make it in huge batches, so it takes a lot longer than an hour and 25 minutes to make it, but it's worth the effort for sure! We like to serve this over spätzle at big family events.
You can easily make it gluten-free by using gluten-free bread for the breadcrumbs (thaw then toast to a nice crispiness, then crumble), substituting corn starch for thickening the gravy, and serving over veggies instead of noodles (or you can just use gluten-free noodles or make the spätzle with gluten free flour, no one will be the wiser!).

I made this exactly as the recipe was.  Used all the optional items too.  Fresh ground pork loin and ground chuck roast rather than store bought burger.  Absolutely fabulous!  Will definitely make these again.  They will be part of our regular lineup!

I have made this dish at least 10 times now.  My 8 year old and 12 year old boys love them! This has evolved each time I have made them and I think I found what works for me. Here are the changes I have made:
1.    Use bread crumbs or panko crumbs instead.
2.	I always increase the meat ratio and seasonings because they go so fast!
3.	Add fresh minced garlic and ginger.
4.	Chef Paul’s  beef gravy works good for this dish with egg noodles.

I just make the meatballs with this recipe and use the ikea sauce packets. They’re amazing. I usually triple the recipe because I can only get ground pork by the lb, but they freeze well so it’s not a big deal. I don’t typically triple the spices, I just double them because I like it a little more bland.

This recipe was amazing!!! My mom used to make this with pre packaged seasoning (she calls it her cheater Swedish meatballs). My boyfriend and I made it tonight and added the meatballs and egg noodles to the sauce right before serving. And some sour cream. He's usually the cook so it's pretty cool I could make something tasty for once!

These are awesome!! I made it exactly as the recipe instructed. I was a bit worried at first because the meat mixture seemed very wet but the turned out fantastic! I do think I will cut back just a bit on the sour cream but this will be put in my recipe rotation!

Really good. Ate it with bread for lunch. Ate with egg noodles for dinner. I scaled to 18 servings to make 86 meatballs. Only had 4 cups beef broth (needed 6 cups). So I used that and 4 cups chicken broth (needed 3/4 cup). I really like the sauce.

This was sooo good. Really outstanding. I don't think any is going to make it to become leftovers. I made a few substitutions because I made this spur of the moment and didn't want to shop. So all ground beef because I had no pork, all chicken broth because I had no beef broth, and about 2/3 plain yogurt because I didn't have enough sour cream. Still wonderful.

This is a wonderful recipe! The dish tasted authentic and the meatballs were deliciously moist. The blend of spices was just right and rather subtle (I omitted the ginger). It wasn't too sweet either, as I substituted the brown sugar with grape molasses.
This has already become a family favourite.

This was very good. Here's what I changed. I used ground elk burger instead of beef.  I toasted my bread instead of using day old. It was great when I tasted it on the meat balls, burst of flavor from the cream!!!  I did not add the ginger root or brown sugar. I would have even noticed if it wasn't there as this was wonderful anyway!!  My family loved it and I'll definitely make it again.

Perfection! Who knew the key to delicious and moist meatballs was to soak the bread crumbs in cream?! Here I thought my cream of mushroom soup sauce for my Swedish meatballs was already as good as it gets, but this recipe brings them to a whole new level. It's perfect the way it is, the only change I made was that mine were done perfectly at 30 minutes, and taking them out a little early kept them at a nice medium, and that way they don't overcook if you have leftovers and reheat them. Yum yum yum! Sometimes I double the recipe Andy use half of these meatballs for the Swedish version and I use the other half for spaghetti and meatballs! Tastes great both ways!

This was the best Swedish meatballs I have ever done. I only changed 2 things, I use all ground beef only because I didn't have any pork. I also didn't have heavy whipping cream, so I did 50/50 whole milk and butter milk, worked out great.  Thank you for the receive!

Seems like a lot of work, when reading the instructions, but it actually is not bad at all. I used dry crumbs (2/3 cup in lieu of 2 slices bread), 50-50 proportion of beef and pork, and half-and-half cream because that's what I had. The meatballs were perfect to make (not messy like other recipes I have tried) and the cooked texture was moist and tender. My kids really liked this dish--will definitely make again. Note: The stated amounts make A LOT of gravy.

I made these as an appetizer for a party and they were amazing.  I didn't even make the gravy or put any on top, they were so flavorful and savory on their own.   I followed the recommendations and used 1/4 package sour cream instead of 1/2, perfect.   I did have a problem with them crumbling while I was trying to turn them in the pan so I added more breadcrumbs to the mixture, not sure if I had done something wrong while preparing them.

Made this just as directed and loved it! It is labor-intensive so I made a double-batch and then froze some of the meatballs for later use. Making the gravy after the fact works just fine. Definitely a keeper. It compares very favorably with my Swedish husband's family recipe??

I used ground turkey instead of ground beef because I needed to use it up. the lean meat required extra butter in the pan. The meatballs fell apart a little bit but everyone loved it just as well. I also did not add the brown sugar but next time I will try the recipe as written.

The only change was -- I had the grass fed ground beef but no pork..and wanted to make it..So I did..
Finally -- I achieved the taste and texture I have been looking for since a young girl.. The combination of spices seem strange but boy do they work!  Tried, in vain, for too many years.. This recipe is great!   (the only trouble I had was getting the mixture into a ball shape. The meat was so moist. Once it started to brown it did stick together although a little flattened. )

We all loved these, but next time I might omit the nutmeg as I find it overwhelming.  Also, I didn't have any sour cream on hand. So  I made the gravy with cream instead.  Turned out delicious.

The mixture was too wet and did not hold together well. There wasn’t enough sauce.  I would recommend doubling the sauce.  Otherwise, they tasted good and my family enjoyed them.  I used low sodium broth and they were still a little salty for my taste.  I only had 4 oz of sour cream and it was plenty.

I made these for a potluck last week and they were delicious.They were devoured in fact.
Only problem I had was a bit to much cream for the bread and the meatballs were very soft so they were more like wedges than balls.
I had some Mexican Crema which is thinner and less tart than regular so I used that instead.
I browned the meatballs and made the gravy then put it all in the slow cooker to finish; that worked very well.
Less sugar next time as I had to be very careful not to burn them.
I'm making them again tomorrow so I can have some for myself. Out of the whole batch I got only three and one of those was a test before I left home.

This is a little labor intensive to make, but well worth the results.  I followed the recipe  exactly. My family loved it!!  My son said it is his new favorite food. We had no leftovers..I used egg noodles and mixed the meatballs, brown gravy and noodles in a large casserole dish to serve. Excellent!!!

The real deal!!  Added a pinch of nutmeg to the gravy in addition to the salt and pepper and needed more than 3 tbs flour to thicken gravy.

Soooooo gooooood! I only changed a few things and these were absolutely delicious! Instead of dried white bread, I used a half a cup of pork flavored stuffing mix. I didn't use nutmeg or ginger or brown sugar because I didn't have any but they were still amazing. I added mushrooms to my gravy and I forgot to add sour cream. Super delicious and a new family favorite. I made homemade egg noodles to go with.

I adjusted the recipe a little because I used frozen meatballs. But overall pretty good!

It turned out ok, but the meatballs are very sticky and fall apart easily when browning them!

AMAZING!!!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  The meatballs were great!  I will be using them in other recipes, for sure.  And the gravy was soooo good!  I did use more drippings, flour, beef broth and sour cream so I'd have enough gravy to coat the fettucine I made to go with it.  I will be making this many more times.

really solid recipe, will make again. Salt level was just right. The rue didn't take as much flour as the recipe called for, so just add as needed otherwise the gravy will  be too thick.

This turned out well despite some minor errors I made when following the instructions. I would have given it 5 stars had I done everything right. The meatballs were delicious but my gravy was a bit runny. I did notice the nutmeg flavor in my first bite but still very flavorful and tasty. I will definitely make this again.

I made it , but added 1/4 of a finely  minced apple and  1/4 cup of cruces pinnacle to the onions while sautéing, after they were finished I put them in a crock pot with the gravy. I added 1/2 teaspoon of dill and stirred in 1/4 cup of heavy cream and 1 teaspoon of sherry. Okay. Now this was awesome acording to our guests! I liked it too!

Love this recipe! The only changes I made were the use of chicken as the sole ground meat and only one heaping teaspoon of sour cream. I will try with both meats another time but I had chicken to use up tonight. I also made the gravy in the pan I sautéed the onions in.

This recipe is great - tasty and easy to make.  I tripled the recipe and needed to add more spices to achieve that savory flavor of Swedish meatballs, also added parsley.  Will bring to Christmas Eve party!!

I made these for our Christmas party - a double batch and they disappeared. I changed a few things to match our palates and the resources of my spice drawer. I used panko instead of breadcrumbs. I did use a tablespoon of brown sugar and ours were not noticeably sweet. I didn't have any allspice.   
Also, I used a small cookie scoop to measure them, then gave them a gentle roll. I lined a couple of jelly roll pans with foil and sprayed with Pam.  I baked each pan, shifting shelves every 20 mins, for about 1:15 minutes at 350 degrees. I did not pan fry them - I've tried that before. When I worked at an Italian Restaurant we always baked ours. After they cooled I put them into a pan and refrigerated them for a couple of days. I made a sauce with broth.

I thought it was a little heavy on the allspice, but otherwise, delicious. I'll cut that in half next time. I agree with other reviewers that the chicken stock was not needed.

Very nice recipe.  Easy to make.  I did not add brown sugar and felt it was a tiny bit sweet from the nutmeg perhaps. I will make this again and I'll double the gravy/sauce part of the recipe and serve it over noodles.

I have never ever known anyone to add sugar to meatballs. I  am Swedish (O.K. 1/4 Sami) and grew up in Sweden, and nobody in my family or friends of, used sugar in meatballs or any meat dishes. Sugar belongs with cakes and cookies and salt with meats and vegetables is what my mother always said.

Really nice favors. I baked the meatballs on a cookie sheet rather than braising. Had no allspice so I substituted some cardamom and cinnamon which was super. Everyone loved it!

I rate this recipe five stars. I halved the sugar but everything else was exact. The flavor allspice nutmeg and ginger was subtle but very flavorful. I was afraid it would be overpowering but it wasnt. Perfect. My family loved it will definitely make again.

Instead of white bread I used a cup of garlic herb bread crumbs, 1lb pork sausage, .5lbs ground beef and doubled all other ingredients. Then served our over wide home style noodles.

I was going to cheat and buy remade meatballs - Im telling you that would have been a mistake - they are in the crockpot now for a football get-together and tried one.  I backed off the allspice and nutmeg a bit since I burned other dinners by adding the suggested amount.  Fantastic recipe - thanks for posting!

I made this gluten-free by substituting gluten free bread for regular, substituting potato starch for flour, and substituting gluten free noodles for regular. This was time consuming but definitely worth it! We'll be adding this to the Sunday dinner rotation for sure! Even the non-gluten free folks loved it!

These are excellent. We forgot to add the sour cream, but the gravy makes this dish and the meatballs tasted wonderful without the sour cream. If you leave out the sour cream, the recipe is very adaptable. You could add barbecue sauce, asian sauce or any other type of sauce when you serve the leftovers.

This was delicious!!! My family loved this and my 5 year old said, "this is DELISH!". My husband couldn't stop eating. My 12 year old who doesn't like meatballs actually loved them!! I didn't change the recipe except for using onion powder instead of onion.

I used 1.6 lbs of ground chuck, and 1 lb of ground pork. I kept the seasoning measurement the same, but didn't include the brown sugar or ginger. The gravy was half beef broth, half chicken stock, and pan drippings. I added salt and pepper to taste along with parsley,  and thickened it with a roux that really made it turn out nicely. Served over wide egg noodles. It was a total hit. I will make this again.

What a great savory comfort food for everyone. Even the kids loved it! Pretty easy to prepare for such a hearty dish. Gravy was lite brown, but could of been a little thicker for my taste. Meatballs were very tender, juicy and had just the right amount of spice. I served meatballs and gravy over egg noodles cooked separately.  Would definitely make again or recommend. Would be a great dish to surprise Mom or Dad with!

Followed recipe exactly, I'd use just a little less allspice but it is very good!

I used oatmeal instead of the day old bread. And we didn't have ground cloves or allspice, but I put in cinnamon. This is so good! We had a can of Swedish Style Sauce from GFS and used that instead of making the gravy. Served over egg noodles. Delicious!! Will definitely make again.

I used just beef as I had no pork on hand, still delicious! Spices blended perfectly, and the gravy was delicious. Husband, 5 year and 2 year old stamp of approval. Will definitely make again!!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  The meatballs have such a hearty flavor!  The gravy for the meatballs compliments them well!   I served mine with buttered, garlicky noodles (the boyfriend is not a fan of white rice).  I will certainly be making this recipe more often!

No kidding.  This is am amazing recipe.  I make a big batch and freeze in vacuum bags with some of the sauce (no sour cream).  It freezes really, really well.  Yum.

This was a HUGE hit with my whole family!!!!  My kiddos kept asking for more!  Had a little bump with the cream and bread crumbs, but I can tweak that next time. There will be a next time!  This is a keeper :)

Wonderful balance of slight sweetness, mixed with warm spice undertones of flavor. Easy to assemble and I actually made this in under 1 1/2 hours. I will definitely make this recipe again. My husband loved it too.

Amazing! Hubby gobbled them all up with me in one sitting. These would be great to serve as an appetizer at a party as well, but we made it into main dish with some noodles to pour everything over.

I am a 50-50 Norwegian-Swede split, so Swedish Meatballs are near and dear to my cultural "heart, " although I had never made them before. I decided to rectify that for Christmas dinner. These were SO good! Loved the spice mix. I am even considering adding some cardamom next time. And there will definitely be a next time. Also really liked the tang that the sour cream lends. Not sure how authentic that ingredient is, but it certainly was tasty. The Hubbs concurs, too, which is always a plus. He says they were even amazing without the gravy. Thanks for a great recipe!

This is Awesome, plain and simple. The gravy was a bit thick for my taste, so I added all the beef broth and a splash of half and half.  The meatballs were so tender, even before I baked them.  I will definitely cook this again. (I already saved it to my recipe box.)

One of my all-time favorite recipes! Mostly I make it for special occasions but if I make a large batch I use the leftovers for meal prep by freezing single serving trays with the meatballs and gravy over noodles and my kids love them for quick microwave meals. It freezes perfectly! It’s a challenge to have leftovers, though, because the family loves these so much that they go back for seconds every time.

My husband asked me to make Swedish meatballs, and this was the first one I tried, because of the excellent reviews. I made them exactly as written, with the exception of the optional brown sugar. (I didn't have any!) The meatballs were tender, tasty, and easy to prepare. The sauce was delicious!! We served them over egg noodles. My husband asked for the leftovers for lunch! I'll be making these again!

It was good, the only change I did - not add sour cream. If I will cook it again, I would prepare the souse before and let the meat balls be baked in it.

Delicious! My very picky family inhaled these.... I was kind of wishing for left overs, but there were none! I made it with all pork just because I didn't have any beef in the freezer. My hubby said these are as good as the ones at Ikea (and we all love those!)

Doubled the recipe for my son the meatball monger.... that was a sage decision. ....  two 22 year old boys (son and friend ).... everything gone in one sitting.....  when I asked if they were good, I just got a few nods as they kept shoveling them in....  I think they liked them

My daughter was craving meatballs from a certain furniture store, so I decided to give these a try. My husband and daughter both feel these need to be on our regular recipe rotation. I did use turkey instead of the specified meats, and skim milk instead of cream; otherwise the recipe was unaltered. I served it with garlic parsley potatoes.

This recipe was fantastic! I used only beef and used garlic salt instead of regular. I didn't have allspice so I used cloves instead. I also used all chicken broth, added a small pinch of nutmeg and ground cayenne to the gravy, 4 TBS flour and only a few tablespoons of sour cream. I am so pleasantly surprised that these turned out so delicious!
Definitely will be making these for an upcoming Halloween party! Thank you so much NomNomNom for the recipe :)

Great recipe! It's my first time making meatballs and I have learned I need to cut off the crusts of the sliced bread. I used regular milk to soak the bread and it was fine. Definitely fry the meatballs in a non-stick skillet or it won't stay together. The drippings from the baking dish are magnificent for gravy, I added a little milk (Lactaid) after adding the flour and beef broth instead of the sour cream for my lactose intolerant partner, but I think sour cream would have tasted more authentic.

My picky kids even loved these and ate all their dinner!!  Only thing I did different was I only used ground turkey.  I made noodles to go with them and it was amazing.  My husband was calling them Amazing turkey balls all night.  My pickiest kid asked if we could have them forever she loved them so much.

After baking, my meatballs were still formed, but had a "moist" texture to them. I think I had 1); too much cream in my bread crumbs (I used 4 slices of days old sliced French bread), or 2); not enough meat to egg ratio. I doubled my recipe too, which may also have been another factor. Otherwise, the flavour was FANTASTIC! I will definitely make this again, with some adjustments.
P.S. I served my meatballs over whole wheat stroganoff noodles, as an alternative to rice.

This is the first time I've made this and it was a 10 all the way around! The meatballs were perfect ( I used all ground beef because that's what I had) and the gravy was amazing! I made mashed potatoes and I have a couple of very happy men around here! I will be making this again for sure!!!

Doubled the recipe in order to have for next day lunches.  Baked most of the meatballs but fried up about 6 in the pan to have drippings (much easier and less mess).  Used "Better than Bouillon" for the broths.  Might add freshly fried mushrooms to the gravy next time.  Served over noodles... simply delish!!  Had so much to eat that I had to hit the couch after supper.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Very good recipe.  There are a lot of steps to this meatball, but make sure you follow them because the end result is really worth it.  I did make some slight changes I only had ground beef on hand and used that.  Next I will use ground pork too, I am sure that could only make them better.  I didn't add the ginger which was optional and used 1/4 cup of sour cream.  This is a keeper, but for a weekend or holiday meal when you have more time to prepare.

I tried this for lunch on my somewhat picky children. Most raved about it, and I loved it.  My teen said it's the first time he liked the meat even more than the sauce.

Amazing! The only thing I did differently was cut the sour cream to about 1/2 cup and added some soy and worcestershire sauce to the sauce part just to add a little more flavor.

This was delicious!  I actually stuck pretty close to the recipe, which is unusual for me.  The only changes I made were to use whole milk instead of cream and pre-made caramelized onions instead of cooking a minced onion.  The meatballs turned out a bit wet; I had to squeeze out the excess moisture before frying.  I also needed more than 1 Tbsp of butter to brown them.  Next time I'll reduce the milk/cream to 1/4 cup and I think it'll be perfect.  I served this with half a bag of egg noodles and the proportions were right on.  Definitely a keeper!  Oh, and I used all of the optional ingredients.  Delicious!

Love this recipe and I've been using it for a while now! I was wary of the spices at first but now I'd never make this without them. I use a bit less sour cream because I found it too strong the first time around. I also find the baking instruction to be pretty flexible. If I don't have the time, I just pour the chicken or beef broth in the pan, cover it and let them finish cooking. Easy!

My husband & I went to Scandinavia for our honeymoon last year, and have been looking for a recipe for the meatballs we loved while over there.  This comes very close...we LOVE the sweet/savory spices in these!  Adapted a little based on what we had on hand--dry onion flakes, a little bread crumbs instead of bread, used a little seltzer in the meatballs (got that from another recipe here), and used a little cream in the gravy.  Ate them with lingonberries that we brought back with us.  Awesome!

Excellent flavor! Kids asked for repeat! 5 stars for meatballs. I used all ground turkey for health reasons. Turkey is soft which makes browning in pan difficult...they fall apart when turning. Instead, I placed on baking sheet and browned in oven, then followed the rest of the instructions for the meatballs. Reasons for 4 starts is the gravy...too much flour taste.

This was absolutely delish. I followed to a tee and then put in crockpot to keep warm. Only thing was that it seemed there wasn't enough gravy so I am going to double the chicken/beef broth next time. Other than that, it was an amazing Valentine's dinner and the boyfriend couldn't stop raving! Thanks! :o)

This recipe is amazing. My bf had never had Swedish meatballs and now he's obsessed. Even better when topped with mushrooms during the final 10 min or so in the over. Perfect and tasty meal. One of our regular favorites now

Very Yummy!  Used a little over a lb. of burger and a tube of regular breakfast sausage (basically double the meat)...added all the optional seasonings (not optional in our opinion if you want the true Swedish meatball flavor) and added them to the gravy as well.  Meatballs are melt in your mouth tender -- Sooo good.

It was pretty time consuming, but WONDERFUL! It was a nice meal to make on a cold, pre-Christmas evening. Delicious, and thank you!

This was very tasty. I didn't have chicken broth so I used all beef broth and it still turned out nice. Thank you, I will be using this recipe for a long time!

I just made this last night and while the flavor was excellent I found that the meat balls were really soupy prior to baking them.  I had to add three more pieces of bread just to make them stay in a ball shape.  Next time I make this I'll decrease the cream and increase the bread- that's the only reason I give this 4 stars.

This recipe was a hit.  My son, who had had a craving for Swedish meatballs, said the meatballs were light and savory.  Once the meatballs are in the oven, the rest of the prep for this is quite easy. Wish I had made the meatballs a bit smaller, but my arthritic hands couldn't.   I agree with another poster who said to add a bit of nutmeg and allspice to the gravy.  I also added salt and pepper after that.  Will definitely make again.

This was so delicious and easy to make. I have been craving the Swedish meatballs from Ikea and these blew them out of the water. The meatballs were so tender, even my finicky teen ate them and asked for more - SHOCKER - I served them with egg noodles and the gravy worked perfectly with them. Can't wait to have leftovers tomorrow. :)

Kind of crumbly but great flavor. My whole family ate these up but I struggled to keep them together in the pan. Not sure what the problem was.

wow yummy!  I used ground turkey for the meat.  I also used Panko crumbs (about 1 cup worth).  Served with brown rice instead of noodles. Turned out amazing!  Followed the spices exactly.  There are no drippings from ground turkey but the gravy still turned out good.  Second night even better.

Really good recipe...my family and friends all enjoy, even my fiancé who doesn't even typically like Swedish meatballs.
