Instead of crushed ice I used one very large frozen banana. I also used one packet Truvia instead of white sugar and nonfat milk. My oldest son and I split this smoothie for breakfast this morning. Both he and I thought that this is a great flavored smoothie--adding the banana made it even better imo. The issue we had was the flax seed. It gave it a weird texture that made it.......unappealing putting it nicely. I'd like to try this again and possibly omit the flax seed. I think that's really the only thing we didn't like about it everything else about this smoothie was great.

This is so good! I fantasize about this smoothie when I've run out of coconut milk and can't make it. I need to stock up so that that doesn't happen anymore. Thanks for sharing.

I wish I could give this more than 3 stars. I was able to drink most of it but it had a gritty texture especially toward the bottom that was a bit off-putting. I did finely grind my flax seeds. The taste was okay but the nutmeg (I used freshly ground) was a bit overpowering.

I was excited to finally try this recipe as it has been in my recipe box for a long time... But I was a little disappointed! I only had about a cup of ice on hand but I'm sure that didn't affect the recipe that much. I used freshly ground nutmeg maybe about 1/4 teaspoon and it was just right. I think the cinnamon could be reduced to half a teaspoon too. I'm thinking that 2 tablespoons of honey and omitting the sugar would be better. Make sure to finely ground your flax or it will be gritty. I don't mind the texture though. This might be good with some fruit... While writing this review I remembered that I had some bananas in the freezer. Poured the remainder of my glass back in the blender with the rest and added a banana. With this addition you could cut out the sugar and leave the honey as is depending on how ripe the banana is. Also the coconut flavour weakens this way... The coconut milk should be increased to 3/4 cup to a cup and the milk decreased to 1/3 cup to 1/2 cup. Next time I will make sure to use the full amount of ice and test out my tweaks then it will be a 4 or 5 for sure.

I didn't think that ecopolitan approved of sugar so I am surprised at this addition and wonder if it wouldn't be as good without that?
