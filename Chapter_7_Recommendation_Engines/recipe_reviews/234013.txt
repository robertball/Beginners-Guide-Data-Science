I did cook the potatoes in their skins but did peel them after they where cooked. (The family doesn't like russet skins in potato salad.) For us, russets make the best potato salad because they do sort of fall apart unlike red skinned potatoes, which adds to the creaminess.  I don't usually put red peppers in potato salad but it was a nice addition. (Black olives would be good too.) I would suggest using good judgement on the amount of onion, one very small onion would be fine but if you have a really large onion, adjust accordingly.   Thanks for a solid recipe, Emily.

This is good! My red pepper (unknowingly) went bad, so I subbed yellow pepper. Also, I used yukon gold potatoes, as that is all I had on hand. I did not need the added hot water, but did add a bit more mayo. I like the different flavors and textures in this. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I followed the recipe to the letter. It was awesome! We do an international food gathering and so far the Canadian has been the best!. A mouthful of all sorts of different flavors.

Excellent classic Potato and egg Salad. I loved it! Will make it again and again. I excluded the dill.

Good, but not as good as My version of the Best Potato Salad.
