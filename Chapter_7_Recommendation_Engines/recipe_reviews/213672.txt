This was just ok for us.  Fairly easy to make but not as good as we were expecting

Delicious!I would recommend to add more raspberry.  Great summer dessert! Makes a cute patriotic flag when you double the recipe.

AWESOME! Very light and delicious! We really enjoyed this dessert. I used fat free cool whip and sugar free preserves. I followed the recipe otherwise.

Wonderful WOW desert! Next time I would put more of the rasberry preserves inside as it just wasn't enough to taste.

This turned out really good. I didn't have any lemon zest so I added 2 tsp. of lemon juice to the cream cheese mixture. For fruit I used raspberries, stawberries and blueberries. I also used low fat Nilla Wafers and Sugar Free cool whip.

Delicious, and I used low-fat Nilla Wafers too!  Def a great dessert which makes up pretty quickly (minus the "firm" time).
