These are very tasty! I did add a few things. I sprayed the baking dish with some butter flavored cooking spray. I added 1 small chopped onion and some garlic powder. The potatoes didn't stick to the bottom of the dish at all. This recipe is a keeper!

Delicious! I used olive oil rather than butter. The potatoes' texture was the perfect combination of tender-crispy. Thank you Linda!

Very simple and very good recipe for oven roasted potatoes. This is perfect for when you want to pair it with a dish that already has a lot of flavor and you don't want your side dish to compete. I used some red potatoes that I cut into quarters. To cut down on calories and fat, I sprayed the bottom of baking dish with butter flavored PAM and used a bit of olive oil sparingly. I added just a bit of garlic and onion powders to the paprika, salt and pepper. I baked mine in the oven at 425 for 25 minutes tured them and baked for another 15 minutes. These turned out nice and crispy!

Good and simple - to jumpstart things after I cut them up I threw them in the microwave a few minutes before I cooked them.  I too added garlic salt and if I wasn't feeding my kids I would've added a dash of cayenne!

The taste was great but I also found that they took alot longer. They stuck to the pan so I think I will try some other suggestions and not use butter next time.

wow soooo good! I was making roasted chicken and was looking for a good potato recipe to go with it. Man did I hit a jack pot with this one! I did add a tbsp more butter (big butter lover) and about a tbsp of fresh chopped garlic. It was a big hit at our house and will become a regular!

Very good! Next time I will try coating them lightly in some olive oil instead of butter, so that they don't stick to the bottom of the pan as much. Otherwise, they were delicious!

These were so yummy.  I am a HORRIBLE cook but even I could make these... and I didn't mess them up!  I added the garlic powder as someone suggested. I couldn't stop eatting them.

These potatoes made a real splash on the dinner plate – crispy with a golden brown sheen, they tasted just as good as they looked.  I stirred the paprika, salt and pepper right into the melted butter and poured that golden stuff all over the potatoes, gave them a good toss and roasted them at 425 degrees for 40 minutes, turning them once (which also worked out perfectly since I was also roasting a pork tenderloin at the same temperature).  The higher temperature was a guarantee they’d be crispy and delicious.  While extra seasonings or herbs could be an option, none are necessary as these certainly are not wanting for flavor.  This is just an excellent way to prepare potatoes, with a big pay-off for very little effort.

I really enjoyed these potatoes and so did my picky kids. I usually try to follow the recipe exactly, but I had to make a couple of changes based on what was in the house. I used olive oil instead of butter because we were out, and I added some garlic powder and italian seasoning.

We loved these little potato gems.  Was slightly worried about the amount of paprka, which resulted in a very orange color, but it gave the potatoes a nice flavor.  Would for sure make again!

Very nice flavor, and easy.  I didn't have uncooked potatoes, but leftover canned white potatoes, so I just used those.  I was heavy on the paprika since I really like it.  I thought they could use something else--maybe some minced or powdered garlic or powdered onions, but not bad.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe and the potatoes were dry & some weren't cooked all the way through even after 60 minutes.  Not very flavorful, either.  Will not make again.

My mom used to make this, but in the microwave.  I love that it cooks at 350 so you can stick it in the oven with most dinners.  I did add a sprinkle of garlic powder & onion powder & did half butter / half oil.  Delicious!

A solid starter recipe that you can cater to complement whatever main dish you're serving. I eliminating the paprika and loaded up on garlic powder, dried thyme, and a few sprigs of fresh rosemary. Made my kitchen smell delicious, and went very nicely alongside steak.

I loved these potatoes. I had them with baked pork chops. It is a very forgiving recipe as I baked them the same as the chops at 400 degrees for 50 minutes and they came out tender and perfect! It is a wonderful and easy side dish that I will definitely use often.Thank You for sharing!

Very good; I didn't give 5 stars because of my  changes.  I didn't peel them, added some canola oil with the butter which I think helped them to crisp along with the heat turned up to 425 for 45 min.; turned them over half way through! :)

This recipe was so simple to make. The flavor was amazing. I was worried about them sticking so I used a pyrex cake pan and greased the bottom with a little oil. I also added a bit of garlic as we are huge garlic fans. They were excellent and I will definately make them again.

I thought these potatoes were great!  And incredibly easy.  I used olive oil instead of butter  (just eyeballed it until they looked coated) and added in some garlic powder.  I also diced a half of a large onion.  I cooked the dish for an hour at 350, then had to bump up the temp to 400 and cooked them for another 10-15 minutes.  Next time I think I will dice the potatoes smaller (bite size) so each bite has the yummy seasoning mixture.  This recipe was a great way to use up some potatoes!

Quick and easy.  I cooked the potatoes in the microwave for a few minutes before cutting them.  Also added a little garlic powder to them.  They were yummy with ranch dressing.

My husband raved about these! Mixed in wedges of vidalia onion.  Omitted butter, and used just enough olive oil spray to lightly coat potatoes and onions.  Added just a dash of garlic powder.  Served with grilled fish that also had paprika seasoning.

This was good. I microwaved the potatoes for several minutes to speed up the oven part as I had another dish cooking and wanted them to come out at the same time. I only added a sprinkle of onion powder. This did end up needing more salt. Very simple and tasty too.

I added a tsp of season salt and a little bit of crushed rosemary. I did have a little problem with some of the potatoes sticking, but they were so yummy that we were scraping the stuck bits off of the pan. I'll try pan spray next time, and there will definitely be a next time! YUM!

This is a very simple and easy recipe!  I like that it doesn't call for too many seasonings, but I think anyone could easily use a variety of seasonings of their preference.  I made this as a breakfast side dish using only one potato.  As other reviewers have suggested, I sprayed my pan with a non-stick cooking spray first.  I adjusted the seasonings to my taste, and it came out great with the perfect texture; slightly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Will make again!

I made these potatoes last night to go with a marinated pork roast. My husband and I loved them! They were quick, easy and convenient to put in the oven with the roast. Thanks Linda for a great recipe that I will be using again and again!

I gave this a 4 due to my inability to tell the difference between a tablespoon and a teaspoon. I used 2 tablespoons of paprika by accident. Luckily it didnt mess this recipe up. I also added onion powder and minced garlic. Super yummy!!!

I enjoyed these potatoes and added garlic powder and a bit of cayenne pepper as others suggested.  I also substituted seasoned salt for regular salt.  Next time, I might add minced garlic and some finely chopped onion to give the potatoes even more flavor.

Good stuff.  The changes I made were 1) cook potatoes (diced but left skin on) for a few minutes in microwave, 2) baked in a 425 oven for 45 minutes (my chicken was cooking in a 425, oven). 3) baked in buttered pyrex dish rather than in a baking pan, and 4) added chopped chives.  I gave this recipe 5 stars as this recipe gave me the tools to make according to my families taste.  Also it can be baked  at various temps to accomodate the protein that you are cooking.  Thanks.

I cut mine a little smaller so they would cook with my filleted boneless/skinless breast pieces.  I liberally covered them with garlic/onion powder salt and pepper, and tossed them in some veggie oil.  They stuck a little bit, but weren't too hard to get off--and they had the crunchy roasted feeling/taste all over, which is what I was aiming for.

Needed more garlic for us, but that is a taste thing.  We also thought they were better with EVOO not Butter.

delicious. i didn't have enough time to rely solely on the oven. baked 40 minutes. nuked them 10 minutes, stirring every 2 or 3. they were a little spicy for my kids with all the paprika, and they needed more salt. honestly, i think they tasted like curly fries from arby's! and i love those!

Tried last night with my family; all of us really liked it. Super easy and tasty.  A little heavy on the pepper side & might scale back amount of pepper called for.  Went well as a side with ham & green beans

These potatoes were a nice change. I sprayed my pan with cooking spray and didn't have any problem with them sticking. The paprika taste was good, but they needed just a touch of something else. Maybe more salt for my taste. I will defanitly be making these again.

These were great! Perfect with burgers cooked on the grill. I followed the other reviewer and melted the butter in the dish first. I used the microwave instead of the oven though. I just sprinkled a tad of salt, but not much since I used salted butter and used pepper! They were great! Tasted as good as fried potatoes, but easier!

Maybe I did something wrong, but these potatoes came out horribly. After 1.5 hours, they still weren't cooked all the way. I thought maybe my over was broken, but I used another thermostat and it said 350.

I used Olive oil instead of Butter, cut into smaller pieces, and cooked for 60 minutes. I sprayed the pan with olive oil using a Misto and then also poured 2 tbs on top and tossed. Came out perfect. They did stick just a little at first but I let them cool for 5 minutes and they came out of the pan fine.

What's not to like about this?!  It's simple and easy and yummy!  I had one russet I needed to use up and some reds so I used both.  Worked out fine.  I love easy to throw together side dishes like this.  Thanks!

I just started making these and they're amazing! I added just a dash of zesty seasoning salt as well as a dash of onion salt to perk up the flavour a bit more. Wonderful and simple recipe, I love it.

These are easy and quick to make. I cooked them for 10 minutes in the microwave prior to baking as suggested previously. I also cut the salt to one-half teaspoon. Any of your favorite spices could be added--but none are needed. They are delicious the way they are!

Wow, this was the best recipe I have ever tried for oven roasted potatoes!!  Me and my family couldn't get enough of them.  I did not change a thing except I used Yukon Gold Potatoes.  I plan on using the Yukon Gold over the baked when I make this again.  (and again!)

My husband and daughter loved these so I'm giving this a 4 for them. I thought they were too soggy and a could have used garlic or seasoning salt, which I will try next time.

Made this for the first time...loved them and so did everyone else. Used gold potatoes and added all the extra seasonings that were suggested by so many. They were just as  tasty the next day as leftovers.

These were very spicy and delicious.  I used a little more paprika because we love spicy foods, and they turned out fantastic!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I have been searching for an oven roasted potato recipe for a few years that didn't call for a packet of onion soup.  :)  This is our new favorite!  Thanks.  The only addition I made was some minced dried onion.  Excellent!

Yummy...added a little cayenne for a kick.  I cut mine into smaller pieces and still found it took 45 minutes.

These oven roasted potatoes were okay, but nothing special. I used both butter and olive oil for some additional flavor. As for the seasonings, I think the same result would have been achieved by just using seasoning salt.

This was good but nothing special- just average. I just eye-balled the ingredients and im sure i used more than what the recipe called for but even then it needed something more. Average rating for an average recipe.

These potatoes were really good. I have a picky eater in the family and he even ate them, not only ate them but liked them too!!! I didn't use paparika because I didn't have any on hand but i used salt pepper and some chicken rub seasoning and a dash of fresh cilantro and they were great! They stuck to the bottom of the pan a little bit but they were so good! Thanks for a recipe I shall be using in the future!

This is a nice basic roasted potato recipe. For a bit of a kick, add minced garlic, onion powder and curry powder. Olive oil is a great substitute for margarine.

These potatoes were so simple to make and were great.  I did add a little garlic powder and used coarse ground pepper. I cooked them for an hour and they turned out so tender but not mushy.  These are a great side dish when you want something just a little different.  My husband absolutely loved them and will make again soon I'm sure.

Sometimes simple is the best! This recipe proves it. Well, I did add a bit of garlic powder, but I do that with everything but Apple Pie. (smiles)
Thanks, Linda!
