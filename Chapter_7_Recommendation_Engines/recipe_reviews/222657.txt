Nice recipe! The only addition I made was a small can of tomato paste for color and some extra flavor. I also let it simmer for about 20 minutes longer than instructed so it condensed down to a thicker consistency, and served it over jasmine rice. Really tasty.

Very interesting combination of ingredients that nicely compliment each other.  The timings and the measurements are just about right, and if you want a crispier dish you can shorten the times especially on the lentil cooking.  Instead of the soup broth, I used coconut milk, which made it more curry like.  Boiled some rice, and had a nice hearty meal.

This recipe is okay, but it is most definitely missing something...the flavors do not taste balanced to me. There seems to be too much garam masala, it definitely needs salt, and even then it is just okay. For a similar, but far superior recipe, try the Sweet Potato, Carrot, Apple, and Red Lentil Soup on allrecipes.

I am the recipe author and I will add these notes...  This recipe makes more of a stew than a soup.  If you want a thinner soup then add more broth & spices and leave the other ingredients 'as is'.  Also the cooking time will depend on what kind of lentils you use. Red lentils cook very quickly while brown lentils need to be boiled for a while.  If you use red then add the sweet potatoes at the same time as the lentils. If using brown ones then cook first until almost tender then add the sweet potatoes and continue cooking until they are tender. I will mention that garam masala can vary greatly in flavor & heat.  Adjust it (and the salt) to your liking at the end of the cooking. I almost always add a bit more salt at the end even if I've used a regular sodium broth, and I stir in another 1/2 tsp garam masala as well to make sure the flavor is to my liking..  You can also use any other veggies you like - carrots, potatoes -- use what you have on hand.  Make it your own!  I like to top with a dollop of mango chutney  for sweetness and a swirl of plain yogurt to really bring home the essence of Indian flavors.  This dish is loaded with power foods, plus it's easy & delicious. Enjoy!

I read a lot of the reviews beforehand and like one other cook, I felt it was missing something so I modified it mid way thru cook time.

It was VERY good with these additions:
Scaled to 10 servings:
Omit spinach
I omitted "red pepper flakes" and used 1/2 tsp ground red pepper from the Indian store.
1 T ground coriander
2 cinnamon bark (about 2" each) from Indian store (remove before serving)
1 T curry powder
3-4 Tablespoons sugar at the end (this may be a little sweet for others, I suggest using 2 T and add to taste)
Little bit of salt
I blended a few ladles full of cooked lentils and added back to the soup for some thickness.

The Lentils will have a crunch, they are not overcooked or mushy when you follow cook times on recipe.  I really liked it this way.  My vegan friend and non vegan husband liked it.  

I froze what we wont eat in the next 2 days, it doesn't contain anything that will curdle so I suspect the freeze wont hurt it a bit.  It is definitely better the next day after the flavors meld.

This is a yummy Indian inspired dish.  It's great for us here in Tanzania because all the ingredients are readily available (including the red pepper flakes I carried over from the US!). Love the flavor, however, if you want a soup, you'll have to add liquid as there is not enough broth left after cooking the lentils and sweet potatoes.  We happily eat it as a side dish of veggies.  We use swiss chard that we grow ourselves as we don't have any luck with spinach. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe, the only thing I'll change when I make it again is I would shorten the lentil cooking time, because red lentils are so small they don't need 15 minutes on top of the 15 for the other ingredients.

Wonderfully delicious! As a vegan, this hit the spot! On a side note, this soup needs more liquid to be considered a "soup".  I added a 12 oz can of light coconut milk, a diced and peeled granny smith apple, and a small serano chille with seeds removed and minced instead of the red pepper flakes. IT was out of this world!!!!

This tasted great..and the house smells so good now... and I love the combination of spices. I made the following changes with some ideas from another recipe on this site: I used 3 sweet potatoes, I added three chopped carrots, and one chopped apple. I omitted the spinach and red pepper flakes. I added  1 tsp of cinnamon. I used chicken broth because that was what I had on hand, and I added about 1 1/2 more cups of water. I left it chunky like a stew. I would probably serve it with jasmine rice.

This is one of my favorite go to recipes. Lots of nutritious vegetables, lentils and spices. I double the spices because we love spice and today I added some parsley and cilantro because I had a lot of it and wanted to use it up. Delicious recipe, many thanks to the cook!

This is comfort food - I'm not vegan, so that part doesn't really register on my radar.  What matters here is the balance of spices.  Lovely recipe, thank you for sharing!

Are you kidding me? I had no idea what I was making when I started.  The flavor this has is truly amazing.  I loved the combination of earthy lentils and sweet potatoes with the rich flavor in the spices.  I used chicken broth because that is what I had on hand.  I used Red Lentils so I added the sweet potatoes immediately instead of waiting.  I had forgotten to add salt before I ate the first bowl - it barely needed it given the amazing flavor.  I am SO going to make this again!!

Made this for Sunday dinner and it turned out great. I ended up changing the steps in making it after reading the recipe author’s suggestions in the reviews. After adding the veggie broth, I added and cooked the sweet potatoes for 5 mins, then added red lentils and cooked for another 5 mins. Next, I added the spinach for another 3-4mins. Doing it this way prevented over cooking the lentils. I will try this with black lentils next to switch it up. Would recommend to switch things up for dinner.

Very good, easy and spicy.  Maybe a bit to spicy for some members of my family.  Might leave out the red pepper flakes for them next time. ;-)

it was pretty good as is but i had to tweak it a bit. Added some garlic powder, a whole lot of salt and lemon juice from one lemon just to make it less heavy and more balanced. Also threw in some bayleaves and let them zimmer with the potatoes.

I liked this recipe.  At first it seemed like it was missing something, but the longer it sat in the refrigerator for a few days, the better it got.  If I would cook this one again, I think I would cut down a bit on the garlic & onions.  I love lots of each but out of of respect for my co-workers {smile}.  I would recommend this, but finding that missing spice or two would be helpful.  There are some recommendations from other cooks, which might be helpful.

I used home made vegetable broth because store bought has too much sodium.  I used 3 potatoes instead of 2.  Next time might use a bit of coconut milk!!

This soup was delicious!  I only made a few changes: 1) I used French lentils; 2) I only used 2 large garlic cloves (the equivalent of 3-4 smaller cloves); 3) I added 2 cups of water; 4) I added the sweet potatoes and cooked them for a few minutes before adding the lentils, broth and water.  I highly recommend trying this soup.

I didn't have veg broth. One person commented on tomato paste for extra flavor. So I substituted 1 can chopped tomatoes, 1 carrot and water in my Vitamix to make 4 cups of the broth. Still was a wee bit bland so I added some Trader Joes Everyday Seasoning to it.

Great, easy recipe with ingredients from the cupboard. Since I can't leave well enough alone, I added 1/8 tsp allspice, a large handful of golden raisins, and 2 tbs nutritional yeast with water since I wanted more liquid and had used all my veg broth. I used fresh cilantro leaves instead of spinach because that was what I had on hand. Served with a dollop of Greek yogurt, but it didn't need it. Thanks for the recipe.

I loved this recipe. I'm not vegetarian, so I added some cubed beef (browned first before adding the onion) and I accidentally picked up a yam instead of a sweet potato (laugh, go on), but it was great. Definitely making this again.

I didn't have any spinach or masala and only ground red pepper and only 2 cloves of garlic (was a grocery week), so on a whim I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and about 1/2 teaspoon of curry. My 4 year old ate 3 bowls of it and my picky sister asked for the recipe, even my meat at every meal husband loved it, but I agree with other posters, its better if served with something a little crunchy like polenta croutons or some toasted baguette.

Great for when what you have on hand is sweet potatoes and spinach, since we always stock lentils and broth. This made a hearty, tasty dinner that I felt really happy about feeding my family. I could NOT find the garam masala in the pantry, so I threw in some curry powder. Timing on recipe was perfect.

This was really good, and very simple to make.  I followed the recipe exactly and the lentils were a little underdone for my taste, but I will definitely make this again.  The sweet potato was a really nice addition!

Rich in flavor - a winner!  I doubled it (including the spices) the first time I made it.  Added a pinch of cinnamon too.  Tasted remarkably close to the soup enjoyed in an ethnic restaurant.

I am eating this soup right now and it is amazing. I used clubhouse indian masala spice and added pepper and garlic powder and carrots as well. awesome recipe! I doubled it so that I would have lots of leftovers to freeze and its a great healthy dinner that was super easy to make. Thanks!
