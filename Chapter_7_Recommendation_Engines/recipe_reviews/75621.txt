This stuff is pretty good!  I used regular onion instead of green onion, and zucchini relish instead of pickle relish.  I'm glad the recipe reminded me to seed the Chipotle peppers.  It would have been miserably hot had I forgotten!

Wow! I was looking for a spicey spread/dip for my honey - ain't no such thing as too much heat for him. This fit the bill.
He's one of those who dips his french fries into mayo and I thought this would give a nice kick. First, I seeded the Chipotles (as called for), but when he said it could use more heat, I added a bit more and left the seeds in.
Results - wicked hot, really flavorful and this stuff now resides in my 'frig ALL the time. Thanks for posting it.

I had the best fish tacos almost 10 years ago and have never had a really good one since. I knew it was in the sauce, but I didn't have any idea what was in the it. This is the sauce. There is nothing better to go with fish tacos. I'm so happy to have the recipe now.

Good but needed a hefty squeeze of lime juice.  After that, perfect!  Thanks!

Did not care for this.  Everyone preferred the sauce that came with the Quick and Easy Fish Tacos recipe from this site.  This was too spicy for us  and too much mayo.  I think it needs sour cream in addition to the mayo.

I am making fish tacos for dinner. I almost always make a sauce like this but usually just use sugar in loo of relish. Well, let me tell you What!! This Rocks!! I even dragged a chip through it as I was headed out the back door, WOW!! Tastes GREAT!! BTW, I used the whole can of chilies for about 1/2 cup of mayo. It is a tad spicy, mmmmm just the way I Like it!!   Perfect!  Thanks Jenifer,

Awesome sauce! Just what I was looking for for my fish tacos. I did not seed the chipotles, as I love spicy foods.

Loved this!  Replace half the mayo with plain fat free greek yogurt and thinned with some milk to create the perfect dressing for my fish taco salad

I served this instead of tarter sauce when serving fried snapper.
