Great fun to make, and sweet and delicious.  I made it with a group of friends and we all had fun.  I'd suggest a heaping teaspoon of peanut butter and Nutella (chocolate hazelnut spread), that was plenty sweet enough.

Sorry, we didn't like this.  I was very disappointed because we love peanut butter and nutella.  Thought we would truly like this...and didn't.  Thanks anyway for the post.

I made these with some friends and we didn't like them very much. The kids wouldn't even eat them. I did make some with just nutella and they weren't bad. They also made us want lots and lots of water. Sorry but will not make this again.

The nutella and peanut butter had to be melted slightly so that it was easier to work with, but it made a very good snack.

I didn't like these. I love chocolate and peanut butter... but not these. I made this for a cooking club and I took one bite and threw them out.

Pretty good. Obviously very rich. Be prepared-phyllo dough is very hard to work with so be patient!
