This dish was exceptional!  Followed directions precisely, except I doubled apples, and we are not drinkers so I used apple juice instead of wine.  Also, I didn't know whether to cover or not, so I covered first half and uncovered last half.  An absolute keeper...A++++!!!!

This is amazing!  I happened to have only Empire apples, and I increased it to 1 1/2 apples.  In addition, I only had Chardonnay, which I think worked out well since the dish is a little on the sweet side anyway.  Served this with long-grain brown rice and green beans.  The sauce spooned over the rice flavored it wonderfully.  I will definitely make this again!

Perfect for entertaining!  I used a 4lb pork loin roast with 5 gala apples.  I used 2 cups of apple butter instead of apple jelly,  2 onions, 1 1/2 cups reisling wine, 5 tablespoons balsamic vinegar.  Baked in Convection oven at CONV ROAST 325 degrees for       
1 1/2 hours.  Covered for first hour.  Uncover rest of time.  Take out when you get an internal temp of 160 degrees.  Let sit 10 minutes.  So many compliments!!!  Served with balsmati rice, spinach salad and rolls.

Very good!!  I made this using a 1 lb. 2 oz. pork tenderloin.  I cut the wine (chardonnay), jelly and balsamic vinegar in half and thought that was still plenty of sauce.  I had a little trouble mixing the jelly and balsamic until “smooth,” but heating it slightly in the microwave remedied that.  The sauce is thin and sweet, but not too sweet, and very good drizzled over the pork and apples.  I didn’t peel my apples, but next time I would.  The skins didn’t get quite as soft as I would have liked.

So good - Used a Honeycrisp instead of Gala and used Chardoney (sp? not a wine drinker) instead of Riesling because that is what my mom had on hand... EXCELLENT! Can't wait for left overs tonight!!

This was delicious and easy!  I only had a little apple jelly, so ended up using a mixture of apple jelly, apricot preserves and cherry preserves.  I was worried it would be too sweet, but it came out perfect.  Tender and delicious.  My husband Loved it.  Also, used Chardonnay (it's what I had on hand).  This is definitely going in the rotation!

This was the best pork tenderloin I've ever had. I think there are a couple of reasons why this recipe succeeds. 1. The pork is taking a liquid bath throughout the entire cooking process, making it some of the moistest meat I've ever had.  Moreover it retains its juicyness in the leftover phase and is even better if left with the original pan juices. 2. The apple components are a natural pairing for pork.  Though the apples serve as more of a garnish, the apple jelly includes more liquid component and adds sweetness to an already savory pork. It pained my grandmother to admit that this recipe was better than my other grandmother's. Doesn't that make it worth it?

This recipe is great!  Every time I make it, it is gone.  I made a couple of minor changes. Added dried cranberries in with the apples and added mushrooms to the veggies. Also I don't bother to brown it as I usually use a loin and make it for a crowd.  To do this I buy a large loin and increase th veggies put it all in a turkey roaster pour the apple mixture and the balsamic vinegar mixture over it all and turn the oven on to 250 and leave it for a few hours. I have found this works great if you can't be home all day to cook, add some rolls and a salad and you have a wonderful dinner.

DELICIOUS!!!  Great dish for impressing company! I doubled the ingredients for the sauce (because I'm always worried there won't be enough) but you could just stick with the amounts called for in the recipe and have more than enough to spoon over the meat. --Made it for my mother-in-law and she was totally "wowed"!!

This was very good, served to company and everyone raved! Did this all in oven proof fry pan, followed recipe but browned pork and removed to platter sauteed onion and apple added 3/4 cup Riesling reduced slightly then added jelly balsamic mixture to pan and reduced by more then half and put pork back in pan, spooned some of reduction on top, parsley on top and cooked according to recipe served with Au gratin potatoes. I am sure this will be a favorite!

I was so excited to try this after reading the reviews but I'm sorry to say my family and I were dissapointed. Just very bland, didn't care for the apples at all, just not a lot of flavor.

This is one of the best of pork tenderloin recipes! We loved it! It's very tasty! Absolutely recommend!!! Only one change: we used quince jelly instead of apple jelly as we had that one at home. Thanks for this recipe! :)

-Changed olive oil to either coconut oil or peanut oil. Trying to brown meat with olive oil is foolish.  -Reduced jelly to half a cup. That was plenty for a 1.25 lb roast  With those changes, it turned out quite good!

Easy recipe.  I will make it again, but double or triple the apples and glaze.  I added a little cinnamon and brown sugar.  Great Fall dish!

I made it as the recipe stated and it was delicious.  Next time I will add a little corn starch to the apple and onion mixture because it was a bit thin.  But this was truly a great recipe.... Recommended!

Tried this for dinner tonight and everyone loved it! And I used a pork roast instead of the tenderloin and had to double the recipe since the roast was 3 lbs.(also I peeled the apples they came out very tender could go either peeled or unpeeled next time) there was plenty of sauce and I thickened it up on the stove top with some cornstarch. Definitely a keeper will make this again it was really tasty.. my family doesn't eat pork a lot so we'll be making this again  since there was no left-overs. Very good!

Excellent recipe.  I made it as written except that in trying to get everything done quickly, I added the wine to the apple jelly instead of the pan.  So I put the balsamic vinegar in the pan and added the jelly/wine mixture to get all the brown bits up. I served it with fresh picked green beans and rice.
One reviewer said she/he got tired of the balsamic vinegar taste but I have to say the whole mixture melds so well I was never aware of the specific taste.  I'll do this up again for company anytime.

Wow...this was great!  I used apricot preserves because it was what I had and it was wonderful.  The only advice I would give others is to make sure to salt and pepper to your taste.  This really felt like a fancy meal and it's just an everyday Thursday.  I will definately be making this again!  Thanks for the recipe.

We liked this. The pork was tender and tasty and the apples were just starting to soften at 30 minutes in the oven. I prepared it as described and I would agree with other reviewers that less jelly would make sense. I also wondered if it would work well with center cut pork chops in a saute pan on a lower heat to reduce the liquid to a thicker sauce.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipes, however I did make a few changes. I used a roast instead of a tenderloin. I browned it in a tablespoon of olive oil and butter. I cooked it until the internal temperature was 165 degrees which increased the cooking time. But the meat was very tender and moist.  Also, I reduced the the apple jelly to 3/4 cup. After removing from the oven I let the roast rest on a cutting board and added corn starch to the apple and onion sauce to thicken it some.

This is my favorite thing I've made from this website so far!  My husband also loved it and he is a very picky eater!  I only made minor changes like cutting up the pork loin into smaller chunks.  I also couldn't get the apple jelly and balsamic vinegar to be lump free but it didn't seem to make a difference.  I served over some rice and we loved it!

I made this last night for my husband and we both LOVED it!  The directions were easy to follow, and I made it exactly as it called for - it's so good!  I'll definitely make this again.

Amazing!!   Everyone loved it.  Tips: double the apples and sauce mixture.  This is also great over chicken.

I made this exactly to the recipe, no substitutions.  It was great and I wouldn't change a thing.  I have trouble finding apple jelly once in awhile and have used honey and apple juice or apple butter but it's best with the apple jelly.  Perfect combo of pork, onion and apple!

I was really hesitant to make this as I usually don't care for balsamic vinegar in cooked food. I am so glad that I did, it was amazing!!! I tried to keep as close as possible to the written recipe. I didn't have gala so I went with two red delicious and used crabapple jelly because that's what I had. I pulled the roast out at 30 minutes and it was a perfect 145. I have to say that this is one of the best pork tenderloin recipes that I have made. Loved, loved this dish. If your sitting on the fence about this one, don't wait. It's that good. Thanks for sharing your recipe!!!

Great!  I often use pork tenderloin and need new ideas.  This one worked as written and allowed for messing around in the kitchen preparing the rest of our Sunday family meal.  I make crabapple jelly (which always goes well with pork) and this worked for the apple jelly ingredient requirement.  Only problem - NO leftovers!!!

Delicious and super easy.  I used 1.5 pork tenderloin and peeled the apple.  There was a lot of sauce and it was rather thin but it surprisingly got all eaten.  Served with mashed potatoes.

This was wonderful! I didn't have the jelly, so I used honey, cinnamon, and a touch of clove whisked with the vinegar. Very good.

I doubled the recipe and should have tripled it since it went so quickly and I like my dishes to last at least three days with a family of four. People were eating it twice a day! I LOVED the apple gravy and added a lot more apples like people suggested. I only needed half the glaze the recipe required, so I saved the rest for next time around. I'm making it again this week!

Very very Good! I served with diced oven baked red potatoes, Corn and Cherry Pie!  Our company couldn't get enough. I did make the following changes: used more chopped apples, used apple juice to replace wine. Did not have balsamic vinegar so I used Red wine vinegar. My husband said, this is diffinately something I will want again real soon!  ME TO!

This has to be one of the best pork tenderloin recipes I've ever made.  I made thisdish exactly as written. The roast came out melt-in-your-mouth tender. I used A really high-quality basalmic vinegar which blended perfectly with the apples. I'm glad I controlled myself and now have leftovers. I threw some small Yukon potatoes in the dish to roast. They were spectacular as well. Next time I may throw some carrots or rutabaga in. Love it.

Great flavour and the most moist pork tenderloin I've tried. Couldn't find apple jelly so used apple butter - could have used more of the sauce so will make more next time.  I baked at 375 vice 350 and still needed 60 minutes to get to "just pink". A keeper!

The only thing I changed was replaced wine with apple juice.[Cant eat anything with wine in it} Made this for the first time for Easter dinner. Everyone seemed to like it.  Was easy to make and presented very well.  Will definitely make again.

Followed the directions and a few inputs from other reviews. This was an exceptional dish, especially the left overs. I paired with rice and roasted veggies (squash, zucchini, red potatoes, garlic, pearl onions, and rosemary). The sauce was very runny, so put the juices in a pan with about 1 tbsp of cornstarch. Fantastic meal.

So I'm not a foodie, but this recipe looked good so I gave it a try ~~ delicious!!!  I pretty much stuck to the recipe.  I found a cheap jar of apple jelly at the local grocery store in the jelly aisle (some people have struggled to find it) , used Chardonnay 'cuz I had it around, and added cornstarch to the drippings to thicken into gravy -- that is a MUST!!!  The apples and the gravy provide the flavor for the meal??.  I will be making this again -- and it would be a great dish for a small dinner party!

We adored this! It is the best pork tenderloin recipe, the apples were perfect compliment to the pork which was so very tender. I served it with brown rice and a veggie stirfry, the sauce is yummy on the rice.

I love this recipe.  I have already made it 3 or 4 times so I finally decided to leave a review.  I always follow everyone's advice and add more apples. It is also difficult to find apple jelly where I live (Austria) so I have substituted cranberry jelly instead. Also, I  have used a few different kinds of wine and they all turned out great.  Today I used a fairly dry wine but sweetened it with a little pear juice that I had in the fridge. Delish!   Be sure to check the cooking times for the meat. Of course different size roasts need more time, so make sure to cook according to weight. Happy Eating!

Meat was tender and sauce was tasty. One thing was did not make 5 star was meat itself was a bit tasteless. But it was awesome with tasty sauce. I used 1 cup of apple butter instead of apple jelly and used apple cider instead of apple juice. Still came out awesome!!!

I cooked this for tonight's dinner, and it is FABULOUS!! I made a few changes, based on what I had on hand to work with, not because I am one who totally rewrites a recipe! I used a pork roast tenderloin and two Gala apples. Not being a big parsley fan, I thought thyme would work nicely with the pork so added that. There was no wine on hand, and we don't drink apple juice, so what I did was mix an individual serving packet of apple cider! We had no apple jelly either, but I found a jar of fig jam and mixed it with apple cider vinegar rather than balsamic vinegar. I served it with long grain & wild rice, along with green beans & mushrooms. This is a seriously wonderful dish! The pork was so tender, no dinner knife was needed. It is comfort food at its best, and I thought, as I was savoring each bite, that this would be so nice for Thanksgiving for someone who wants to deviate from the traditional turkey meal. Please give it a try!

I loved this recipe.  The pork wasn't dry, and the sauce just was the bomb!  Definitely one of my favorite pork recipes from now on.

Made this wonderful dish last night and thoroughly enjoyed it more than I have enjoyed a new recipe in a long time.
Thank you for sharing.  I didn't change one thing.

Awesome..is the word to describe this!  Made it today, and will definitely make again! I used Chardonnay like others did, and it was perfect.  I think any white wine would do. If you haven't tried this yet, you need to!

We used white grape juice instead of the wine and it worked great. Good recipe! Glaze was a little thin.

This was excellent! Easy to make and delicious. Yummo! The pork came out tender and juicy. My only changes were: I seasoned the pork before I browned it in the pan, I used dried parsley instead of fresh, and I didn't use the wine. This is a keeper!

OMG! This was a delicious meal.  I had mashed potatos with it.  I also followed other reviews and used chardonnay wine and 3 apples. When tenderloin was done took sauce and used hand mixer to make into a smooth gravy.  Even the kids enjoyed.  Will definately make again.

This was amazing and impressed my very picky MIL!  I did use chardonnay b/c that's what I had.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly and it was really great.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks Hyakurin!

To make this even easier and faster, use the same oven-proof skillet start to finish and a higher heat.  Instead of transferring the cooked onions, apples and reduced liquid to a separate baking dish, just add the tenderloins back into the same oven-proof pan. Spoon the sauce over them and put into 450 degree oven for 15-25 minutes until thermometer reads appropriate temp. Oven length will depend on how long you browned the meat so how cooked they already are.  Served over rice.

This is delicious, and the best pork tenderloin I ever have made! I didn't change a thing. I wouldn't have thought of using Riesling, but it is just right for the pork and apples.

Loved the flavor and tenderness of the pork.  The glaze is delicious.  I added diced potatoes (because my Irish family loves potatoes) with the onion apple mix, and I subbed apple cider for wine.  My family loved it. Next time I may double the glaze to cover the veggies too.

Browned the meat in canola oil instead of olive oil. Other than that change, followed recipe.  The meat itself didn't have much flavor and the sauce was very watery. Over all needs a few changes.

I served this at a small family dinner party, and everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe as written except that I doubled the sauce recipe.  Instead of coating the meat with the jelly/balsalmic mixture, I put half of the wine,and the jelly/balsalmic in the pan with the pan with the apples and onions.  Then I reduced that by a quarter, added the rest of the wine, and reduced it by a quarter again.  After the second reduction, I poured the mixture over the roast and baked it.  I gavve it 4 stars because it took longer to bake than the instructions called for, and despite being cooked through, the meat was not as tender as I would have liked.  Next time, I think I bake the tenderloin low and slow until tender, then add the sauce and bake at 350 until the glaze is bubbly.  Still, despite the meat being less than tender, my guests raved about it.  This recipe made me look like a hero.  Can't ask for more than that.  Thanks for sharing it!

Wonderful, my husband finished it in one sitting!  Had a pork sirloin vs the loin.  Also no wine so used 1/3 sweet cider and the rest sherry to make the 1/2 cup.  Otherwise, just followed the recipe!  Then thickened sauce a bit with cornstarch. Yummy.

This is delicious! I didn't have apple jelly, so I used applesauce, and only as much as I had, which was about 1/2 cup. And, I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used dried. I had a Pink Lady apple on hand, so I used that, too. Given those substitutions, I think the keys to success with this recipe are the browning, generous amounts of salt and pepper, wine and balsamic vinegar.  Those added the most flavor and kept the meat moist. Will definitely make again!

I didn't have any apple jelly on hand but I did have apple butter. I also used Chardonnay wine. Although my husband said it was good, he also said that I don't need to make it again. What a mixed message is that!?! Anyways, I may try it one more time hopefully with the jelly. I checked both my local Jewel and Marianos and couldn't find apple jelly. Hmm. If I can't find any, I'll try again with the apple butter but will add a tablespoon of brown sugar. The pork was tender but to me the flavor was slightly lacking and not very sweet as other reviewers stated. Also, my pork wasn't swimming in hardly any liquid as others stated. I had to double check the amount of liquid added to make sure I didn't miss the correct measurement.

I followed the directions exactly...except for 2 minor changes.  I used  a Honey Crisp apple and I used Pinot Grigio wine because that's what I had on hand.  This was the most amazing port roast I have ever made and I have never really cared that much for pork...until now!  My guests loved it and my family loved it!  I will definitely be making this again!

This was really good!  The only changes I made were using Chardonnay instead of Riesling wine and increasing the chopped parsley to 4 tsp instead of 2.  That should have been insignificant as far as taste, but 2 tsp was not enough to spread on both sides of the tenderloin.  As mentioned in other reviews, I peeled the apples, and I reduced and thickened the sauce on the stove top after removing the cooked apples.  I agree with others, too, that less sauce would have been sufficient.  The meat was tender, moist and the sauce very tasty.   My husband and I had the pork with seasoned broccoli and black eyed peas since it was January 1!  This is definitely good enough for company and will be made again.

A really good dish. While visiting my brother I made it for a dinner party of  9. Just doubled the recipe. My sister-in-law made it  2 weeks later. I did reduce the apple, onion and wine mixture for a few minutes. My only problem was finding a store that had apple jelly.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. Next time I may tweak it a little, probably some extra parsley and another half an apple. But definitely a really lovely recipe, and is going to get added to the regular rotation.

This is an amazing recipe!  Just made it yesterday for company and it was a big hit.  I prefer more apples and cut down just slightly on the apple jelly.  Serve it with cornbread and roasted butternut squash - you will be a star!

This was quite possibly the best dish I have ever made.  At least lately anyway!  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was easy but just enough ingredients to make it oh, so special!  I served it with homemade cranberry sauce and roasted cauliflower.   I cook a lot but rarely eat my food.  There is something about it that after I've handled it, I taste it but it doesn't usually appeal to me to sit down and eat it but not so this time.  My whole family loved it and we had no leftovers.  My husband said it was "fancy" and greatly enjoyed a Monday night dinner that was divine.  You can't go wrong with this one if you like pork (which we prefer to red meat).

This was delicious!  I made this last night for my husband and daughter (who hates pork) and they both raved about it.  I had two tenderloins ( 2.62 lbs total)  so I doubled the ingredients, except for the jelly and balsamic vinegar glaze.  The glaze was enough for the two, as other reviewers said they had plenty leftover from one tenderloin.  I would even triple or quadruple the amount of apples and add a little more onion since they were a big hit, as well.  I used chardonnay wine based on others reviews, and am glad I did since it tasted sweet enough .  I followed the directions and it came out perfectly after 45 minutes.  I may try to thicken the juices next time, since it was thin, but overall I was very satisfied!

I liked this recipe, but it needs a little work.  I seasoned the meat before  cooking with salt, pepper and a little garlic powder, I would suggest seasoning it earlier in the day.  Also the sauce was runny, so next time  I'll add a little cornstarch to thicken it up. I didn't get a lot of vinegar taste that a lot of people complained about, but I think the acidic taste with the sweetness of the other ingredients would be good, so next time I'll reserve some of the vinegar to add at the end.  All in all a good recipe, but with a little tweaking this could be really  tasty.  I will definitely be making it again.

I'd use 3 apples next time. Be sure to cut them into fairly good size chunks because they bake down to almost nothing. It was good, but with only 1 apple, it was pretty much just a piece of pork in juice.

So very good. Just made it following the recipe as shown. The only difference was I couldn't find plain apple jelly anywhere so I used what I did find which was Apple jalapeño jelly. It was delicious. Can't wait to make it again!

I made this for a dinner party. Everyone loved it. As suggested by others, I doubled the sauce ingredients and used chardonnay instead of liebermilch. Sauce was perfect that way. Just be careful not to overcook the meat.

The loin itself came out moist but not really flavorful and the abundant apple/wine/onion moisture reminiscent of watery applesauce. On the whole it was disappointing.

This was FABULOUS!!!  I didn't have any white wine available so I substituted apple juice.  Pork was nice and juicy and the flavors were just wonderful together.  Definitely recommend this one!  Teenager told me it was the best pork I ever made!!

Made this last night for dinner and it was a hit with the family. It was an easy dish to execute.  One cooking step I changed was to salt & pepper the tenderloin before searing. I also used the advice of another to heat the jelly/vinegar mixture to help it blend without lumps. Like others, I used 2 apples & a touch more onion & finally used chardonnay as it's what I had on hand. I served it with steamed asparagus & a baked potato. I'll definitely make it again. I could also see experimenting in making it into a one dish meal by adding carrots & yukon gold potatoes. :)

Followed the recipe and it turned out very good.   Tastes like a meal you would be happy with in a nice restaurant.   Made with over roasted potatoes and tomato salad.  Pairs well with glass of Reisling.

I used a small tenderloin roast (same weight recommended)instead of just a tenderloin.  I browned it in olive oil then followed the rest of the directions. Baked it uncovered in a French baking dish. The pork itself was one of the most tender roasts I have ever tasted.  The flavor was delicious, but I will work with the recipe to get rid of the sweetness.  Didn't like that at all.

I had to use apple butter because I couldn't find apple jelly in any of  the stores I shop at.  I mixed it with the vinegar and only put on half the amount and it was still way too sweet. Didn't like the apples at all.  Maybe better uncooked as they got mushy. I did not get an overwhelming balsamic taste as many described.  Could have just used a couple tablespoons of the apple butter/Balsalmic and one apple max (I doubled the apples like some folks suggested).  I also used chardonnay as I had a bottle open.

I cooked it to the suggested 145 and let it sit for 10 minutes.  Juicy, moist and delicious after I scraped the toppings off.

Terrific flavor.  Cooked in my Ninja 4 in 1.  Followed recipe except used apple  juice instead of wine.  Sauce was consistency of molasses, thinned with  more juice before serving.  Next time I'll double the apple juice at the outset.  Probably an adjustment unique to Ninja 4 in 1.

This was exceptional!  I made it exactly as stated just added a little garlic to the onion/apples.   The pork was tender, with a great flavor!  Even the kids loved it!  A new "got to."

I made it with a white blend, candy apple jelly, honey crisp apple and it turned out great!  I would serve it with a savory cous-cous if you don't want a sweet meal.  We loved it but like pork tenderloin any way it is prepared.

I didn't want to go to the store, so I had three modifications.

I used Chardonnay instead of Riesling.  I used apple butter instead of apple jelly.  I only had a red onion on hand, not a sweet one.  

Despite this, the dish came out absolutely fantastic and I will certainly make this again with all the proper ingredients to see if it is an improvement.  Though I have to say, I think the red onion gave it more kick than a sweet one.

I served with roasted sweet potatoes and brussel sprouts.

Yummy! I made a few changes. I used one and a half Honeycrisp apples peeled. Used 1/4 cup apricot brandy instead of wine. I used one cup of apple jelly which was too much. I browned the roast; sauteed the onions with apples: added the jelly, brandy and 1/4 teas of pumpkin pie spice in the pan. I was apprehensive about the balsamic vinegar so I added just a splash which was perfect. If you can, try to reduce the sauce, but you don't have to. Added the sauce on top of pork and put in oven (covered) at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Pork was a bit over done. Next time will reduce oven temp to 325 degrees.

I will make this again and again.... It was very delicous. I used apple juice instead of the wine, I added 3 cloves of minced garlic and I did not have the apple jelly.  Next time I will add that as well.  the dish was wonderful on rice.

I try to always follow the recipe exactly the first time. Then I make changes if it warrants. I couldn't find apple jelly so i had to use apple mint jelly. Otherwise, it was great just as they show. I served it with stuffing adding apples to the stuffing and maple roasted carrots.   Really tasty. Good the next day too.

The recipe was as good as it sounded. I didn't change any of the ingredients but did use less of them except the Apple.I thought I had a pork tenderloin out but it was boneless ribs. Just as good and will make again.

I was surprised how good this was! I was worried my husband wouldn't like it - he's a pizza/hamburger/hot dog kinda guy - but he loved it! ( Except for the apples, but I ate all of those.) It was very juicy and flavorful. I used Chardonnay instead of Riesling, a Granny Smith apple instead of gala, and I baked it covered for the first 30 minutes and uncovered for the last 15 minutes. I fully expected to have leftovers, but we polished the whole thing off. I will definitely make this again.

I didn't have Balsamic Vinegar so I used Apple Cider Vinegar instead and it was very delicious. My husband particularly enjoyed it. I baked sweet potatoes and steamed some whole green beans to accompany the pork with apples, nice presentation as well as tasty 
We were so hungry I forgot to take any pictures,
maybe  next time ;)!

I doubled the recipe, and put it in the crock pot after browning the pork in the skillet. I also added some minced garlic. After four hours on high, the pork was falling apart tender. The "juice" was both sweet and savory. I had my teenaged grandsons over for the weekend, and everyone loved this dish. I added some rice to the leftovers and we had a second meal.

Everyone enjoyed it. I would have given it 5 stars, but I seldom do that. It seems to be versatile recipe. We used red pepper jelly because that it is what we had and it worked great. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe, Hyakurin!

I didn't have the wine so used applejack and I used 2 apples.  The pork was very tender and the sauce was good.  I think it would be even better the 2nd day.

I was disappointed with this dish.  I used applesauce instead of the apple jelly and I overcooked it a bit but I did not care for the flavor of the apple onion mixture.  I won't be making this again.

Yum!  This dish is so good and so easy.  After reading reviews, I opted to increase gala apples to 2 and I used chardonnay in place of riesling (we're not riesling drinkers and I didn't want to have to buy something just to make one dish).  I sautéed the pork tenderloins (I used two) in a pan sprayed with nonstick cooking spray in place of olive oil.  Once they were browned, I transferred them to a dish sprayed with non-stick cooking spray and added 1 tablespoon of butter to the pan to sauté my onions and apples.  I added the jelly, which melted it, and wine and reduced it for 5 minutes to thicken the mixture up a little.  At the end, I added the balsamic vinegar.  I baked mine about 45 minutes.  After letting it rest for about 10 minutes, I sliced it in the baking dish so it would soak up that wonderful sauce.  Very delicious!  Served with roasted sweet potatoes and steamed broccoli and my family loved it.  I will make this again and again.  Next time, I'll probably reduce the apple jelly to 1/2 or 2/3 cup.  Otherwise, we really enjoyed it.

I am new at this cooking thing,  but this was delicious.   Used apple juice,  instead of the wine as one lady suggested.  

We used the sauce as a dip, and put a piece of meat, Apple,  a little dip in the sauce.   Really good.

I really wanted to like this.  We love pork as well as the rest of the ingredients but we found it too sweet (didn't think that was possible for me though) and the pork was just not flavorful.  Sorry to say I won't be making this again.

Guests all liked it.  I made as per instructions except for adding a teaspoon of allspice to the apple-onion mixture.  I thought the sauce was a bit too runny, next time I will reduce wine to a quarter of a cup.  Will make again..

i was so excited to try this but was left hugely disappointed. firstly it was so bland. the sauce on itself was great but it did not help tie in the whole dish together. also 30 mins is too long to cook tenderloin mine was still a little pink inside but it was already too well done for my preference. i would suggest reducing the cook time in the oven for anyone who wants to try this dish out!

Excellent & easy. I used hard Apple cider instead of wine and apple butter instead of jelly, only because it's what I had on hand. You could use apricot jelly too. Very adaptable , great Fall or Winter meal! Thank you!

This was very good! Made a few changes. Used 1.75 lbs. boneless loin chops, used 4 small, peeled and chopped Gala apples and one LG. onion chopped. I used 1.5 C. White Moscato wine to deglaze the Apple/onion mix. And for sauce I used 1 C dark Apple butter, 1/2 C. Apple jelly, 1/4 C. champagne jelly and 1/4 C. fig preserves with a spice mix stirred in, along with only 2 T. dark balsamic vinegar, of garlic salt, allspice, cinnamon and good dash of sage. I seasoned chops while Browning with kosher salt, garlic salt and cracked mixed pepper. Laid approx. 6 T. chopped fresh parsley on chops before adding the rest. This is very forgiving recipe with which you can get creative and use up small amounts of jellies you have on hand as well as wine. I hoped it would not turn out to sweet and it s wasn't at all. It was perfect, the sage, garlic and allspice brought a very ethnic German/Bavarian flavor to the dish, adding just the right amount of complexity. Go easy on the dried, rubbed sage, I actually used only around 1/3 of a teaspoon for this large amount of sauce. Only change I would make next time would be to thicken sauce a bit after baking is done. Covered the chops 30 min then uncovered for 15 more. Served over buttered Spaetzle noodles sprinkled with poppyseeds and a side of my own carrot/Rutabaga mash. This was really a fabulous, exotic take on great comfort food.

Made this the other night, and even though I didn't use the exact ingredients, it was still delicious. One of the best recipes I have made in awhile. Firstly, I used a marinated  tenderloin (not heavily seasoned), which is kind of foolproof. I also used 5 small apples (not sure what kind because they came from my neighbor's tree), organic raspberry jelly , white balsamic vinegar and white cooking wine. This was what I had on hand and not because I was attempting to alter the recipe. I also omitted the salt since the marinated tenderloins are inherently salty. 

I followed the directions exactly, including the cooking time , even though the temperature was lower than the cooking instructions on the tenderloin package. I was concerned that it might be too sweet, but it was just right, and surprisingly yummy. Despite the difference in temperature recommendations, this was cooked perfectly. I wanted to make a stuffing, but ran short on time, so I served it with rice and roasted Brussels sprouts. We ate and enjoyed every last Mother Lovin' drop, and I would absolutely make this again. Great dish for Fall weather!

I did add a little cayenne pepper (not in the recipe but I am in New Orleans), everything else was done according to the recipe.  My husband said "if you ate this in a fine restaurant in the French Quarter, you would recommend this dish to anyone."  Wow, I served it with baked macs and the gravy/sauce it made was amazing.  Do not cooked it past 145.  Enjoy.  If you have anything left, its good the next day too.

I rubbed the pork with Tony's seasoning, garlic power, salt, pepper, and sugar. I let it sit in refrigerator for 3 hours. Then blackened in iron skillet. 
After cooking (as directed) I added a cup of chicken broth to the juices with a teaspoon of corn starch in it.  This made a tasty thickened gravy. Super meal!

Overall, it's good, but a bit too sweet and my sauce was quite liquid, I prefer it thicker. Will try it again but with some changes, probably will just use puréed apples instead of jelly.

mmmmm....this was so delicious and a definite make-again! I couldn't find apple jelly so used apricot jam instead. Also only made half the balsamic/jelly mixture and found it was enough. Really good and really easy! Just used an oven-proof skillet and made everything in that one pan; Just set aside the pork to make the sauce and spread the jelly mixture on before adding it back in to  the pan to finish in the oven. I take my tenderloin out at about 137-140 degrees and rest it about 10 minutes so it rises to about 145 degrees. I found it only took about 15 minutes in the oven after searing at the same temperature listed but my tenderloin was only about a pound. Thank you for posting this recipe, it is good enough for company but simple enough for a regular weeknight dinner!

Made this following the recipe exactly.  Had a good tenderloin cut, not that vacu-sealed tiny tenderloin from the grocery store.  I think that makes a big difference.  My wife thought it was a little heavy on the onion, but I think I'll just use some Oso sweet onions instead of a vidalia next time.  I made a double batch of this because the butcher shop I go to double packs them.  I did them both at the same time.  Two pans for everything.  Probably add more parsley next time as well.

The apples and onions add a wonderful flavour to the tenderloin.  I did not have apple jelly on hand, so I substituted it with an apple compote, which had a strong cinnamon flavour.   Apple sauce or other fruit bases could be used with this dish.  It's a keeper for me!

I just cooked this for the first time. It's delicious. I was a little skeptical about the apple jelly, fearing that the dish would be too sweet. But it wasn't; there's a nice balance. The wine and the balsamic vinegar offset the sweetness of the jelly to make a wonderful combination of flavors. My instincts told me that rosemary would be a nice addition, so I added a teaspoon of dried rosemary. Could have added another teaspoon. Will definitely make this again.

Outstanding dish!!!  Hubby and teenager gave it rave reviews...the pork comes out very tender and moist.  I made some adjustments based on reviews I'd read in advance...added more apples (peeled), used apple cider as well as white wine , pinch of cinnamon/nutmeg and added some dried cranberries.  I also used most of the juices to make a thicker gravy when it came time to serve.  Leftovers for sandwiches tomorrow :)

This pork is delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and cooked it for about 45-55 mins. It was so tender with a slightly sweet taste. If you like sauce for rice, you may want to double the jelly, etc. I also made Cola Sauerkraut (by Drew the Cop on this site) and it was awesome. We loved this dinner so much, we made it again 3 days later :)

Nov. 10, 2014.   I have wanted to try this recipe for awhile, however, had hard time finding the Apple Jelly! Finally found at Winco in Tualatin.  I used two tenderloins and doubled the recipe.  Boy, am I glad I did.  Mike husband raved about it and is very happy we will be having it again.  Served with Green salad and Brown and Wild rice dish with onions and mushrooms.  The sauce from the pork was wonderful on the rice.  Very easy to put together.  Cooking time was 30 min.  Covered for about 10 min.  Perfection??Cathie

Made this tonight and will make it again because everyone loved it! Perfect meal on chilly Fall/Winter days. The only variations I made were using Honeycrisp apples (and double the quantity) and Apricot preserves instead of Apply Jelly.

I, too, was looking forward to making this recipe based on the other reviews.  It was good but with a tweak or two, I could give it five stars.  First of all, I followed the recipe exactly.  My problem with the recipe is that it was too sweet and my family typically loves things on the sweet side.  I'm wondering if a change to Chardonnay or other dry white wine would make much of a difference?  Also, the glaze mixture made plenty and could probably be cut in half.  The apple/onion/wine combo was delicious on its own.  Perhaps adding another savory element would tame down the sweetness of the sauce a bit . . . Maybe sage or Worcestershire?  I will try this again with modifications and re-post.

My wife made this last night. It was wonderful. The sauce was delicious. Next time we might reduce the sauce a bit, but that would be somewhat of a difficult process as we wouldn't want the apples to turn to mush.

We loved this recipe.  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and doubled the apples.  I also browned the tenderloins in coconut oil, baked this in a convention oven on roast and covered it the first hour.  The next time, I'll seer the tenderloins on the grill so I can keep the mess and smoke outside.  I doubled the tendonloins and quadrupled the other ingredients. We like lots of sauce. I didn't have any Reisling so I used Chardonnay.  The grocery store was out of Apple jelly so I used Apple Cranberry Chutney. Since I have not made this recipe before, I don't have a basis for comparison, but we loved the flavor and the meat was tender. Next time I make this recipe, I'll make a Chutney Chardonnay reduction before adding it to the onions and apples.  We thought the onion Apple combo was wonderful. I would have never thought of that. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.  This is a keeper!

I doubled the recipe but only used 1/3 cup of jelly & 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar - it just says to brush it the once and there's still a bunch of it left... it came out really tender!  Reactions to the apple/onion mixture were mixed.  I really liked it!

I made this in the slow cooker. Left the apples a bit firm when sautéing and then put it all in the slow cooker on low for 6 hrs,  Took out the meat and cranked up the heat.  Yummo.

Made this today, oh, my, it is wonderful. I only had crab-apple jelly and rose wine, but it was so delicious.  I added a little extra apples, and I have enough left for another meal.  I served it with baked acorn squash and garlic mashed potatoes.

I had a problem finding a baking dish appropriate to fit a long round tenderloin. I ended up using a bread loaf tin and cutting the tenderloin in half crosswise.  Then the amount of onion/Apple/Reisling mix and the Apple jelly/balsamic mix worked out to be the perfect amount nearly covering the tenderloin. I too had to microwave the jelly mix to get it to blend. Final result was a fabulous tasting roast.

I made this last night and my husband loved it. I only changed two things, minced onion seasoning instead of a raw onion and I use melbac wine instead of riesling. I thought I had riesling and was 3/4 the way into the recipe and realized I didn't. Turned out GREAT!! We actually saved the leftover apples and are going to warm them up tonight for desert with vanilla ice cream. I will be making this again, it is super easy! One note, only cut what you want as it dries out quickly.

Made this recipe last night for the first time for guests.  I used two large Jonagold apples so there would be enough to serve as a side dish.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written. Very good - my guests enjoyed it very much. Served it with haricots verts and a crusty french bread. Will make again.

Didn't have apple jelly on hand so used what I had which was a little pear, some blackberry wine, and some strawberry jalepeno.  Substituted white zif for the riesling wine, and used dried parsley.
Increased the olive oil a little also.  Delicious.

Delicious, moist and tender.  Everyone loved the sauce as well.  I did have to cook my tenderloin twice as long as the recipe called for and bumping the temperature to broil for the last 10 minutes to get the pink out of the middle but I believe it was because I had a short fat tenderloin, rather than a long skinny one.

This was a hit with my family.  Very moist and I did peel the apple.

There was too much balsamic vinegar for my and my family's taste.  The way the recipe read the jelly/vinegar mixture would stick to the meat and it was so watery that I poured it over the meat and it didn't really stick to the pork very well.  I was really excited to try this recipe but it fell very short of my expectations.

Was amazing!  Used apple jelly with jalapeno's and added a kick to it.

This is good but can be a little bit bland. I served the pork and apple relish over quinoa, and liked the combination. Next time, I would add another apple to the mix and perhaps more onion. All in all, definitely worth making again!

Like many others I was hesitant to make this dish based on the ingredients.  My husband loved it, and so did I.  I ended up adding a more coarsely chopped vidalia onion, and I added an extra apple (Braeburn).  Next time I think I will add more wine to the broth/glaze-- but I omited the apple butter and balsamic, which def made it drier.  We loved it this way, but will make sure to try it with the ab and bv.

This was so delicious. However, I found that I didn't need as much apple jelly and balsamic vinegar than the recipe called for. I'm going to make this frequently from now on.

Cooking time is way off. More like an hour (or close to it).  Also, I was not a fan of the apple jelly in this recipe. I think in the future I will leave that out. All the other flavors were great, though.
