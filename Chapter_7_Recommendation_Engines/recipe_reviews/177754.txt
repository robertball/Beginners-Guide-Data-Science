With my changes it was definitely a 5 star and everyone at the table had seconds and raved about the salad! I did not marinate the shrimp in interest of time. After boiling the shrimp in water to cook them, I sauteed them with the onion, red pepper, garlic, lime juice, and about 1 tablespoon of oil just until the red pepper and onion were tender. I added the cilantro and a sprinkle of fresh grated Parmesan cheese. I tossed everything with romaine and the tomatoes and more lime juice. I garnished with lime wedges and more Parmesan. It was excellent!

This was pretty awful.  The dressing was too runny and it had almost no flavor.

I was good but the sauce was a little runny for a dressing more like water.

It was OK. Not a lot of flavor, and just kind of boring.

Although the recipe didn't specify, I don't think the cooking liquid was intended to be used as a "dressing" for this salad. The flavors actually sound yummy.
