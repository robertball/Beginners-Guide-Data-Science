Yum! Made this last night and followed the directions except I did not strain the sauce, I left in all the pieces of shallot and garlic. Served with mashed potatoes and poured the sauce on them also. My picky husband and son loved it!

The tenderloin came out wonderful, but the sauce was just ok but others at the dinner party liked it. The sauce took longer than the time stated to thicken.

I thought it was a wonderful dish! We had aspargus on the side and we added cranberry juice and real cranberries in the sauce and it was delicious. I would suggest putting real cranberries into the sauce because it looks more homemade that way and it taste far better. :) Enjoy!

I dd this sauce for a Christmas roast and it was excellent.  As others have stated, it needs more time.  I reduced my sauce at least 45 minutes at a fairly rolling boil.  I then added a T. of flour mixed with water to finish it.  The sauce is easy and forgiving but I don't know if I would have liked it without straining.  Visually, the glossy, deep red color, really dresses up the plate.

I made this for Christmas dinner, and it was the best!  I doubled the recipe on the sauce because I had a 4lb tenderloin.  It took close to an hour to thicken and well worth the wait.  Everybody raved about it! I will make this again.

We love this dish!  When making the sauce, I also toss in a handful of sweetened dried cranberries.

I made exactly as written....this was very good and very easy to make. I did not care for the sauce by itself but it does compliment the meat well. I used merlot and cranberry juice for the sauce so it has a strong craberry taste...if you do not care for that kind of flavor you may not like the sauce..I may also try a lighter red wine next time. Like others i ended up using a little cornstarch to thicken and it still came out good. Will make again

This review is for the sauce. I made pork tenderloin instead of beef last night, and served this sauce with it. It was fabulous. I didn't bother with the straining, since I'd minced the ingredients up fine. It was divine! Like others, I wasn't patient enough for it to reduce down all the way, so I thickened it with a bit of cornstarch.

Incredible sauce! I'm serving it with pork tenderloin tonight & I just finished the reduction. 

It has a deep fruit taste and the fresh thyme, garlic & shallots are the perfect balance. I didn't have cranberry juice but I did have a 12 oz jar of cranberry sauce ... worked like a charm. I also used vegetable stock since I'm serving it with pork not beef.

Strained it with cheesecloth & will add a handful of dried cranberries when I reheat it to serve with the pork.
