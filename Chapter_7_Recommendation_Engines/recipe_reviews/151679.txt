I really liked this recipe and it was perfect for using up leftover pot roast. I actually sauteed the mushrooms and onions, added the soup and dijon mustard and heated it all up then stirred in the bite sized pieces of already cooked chuck roast to serve. Next time, I would use a little less dijon than the recipe called for since the taste is very powerful, but I thought this was great for a potluck at church when served over rice. Thanks so much for an inexpensive and easy recipe!

Great dish! Easy to make and very tasty! I added a couple of cloves of garlic (chopped) and a can of green peas when cooking the veggies. Also, I didn't have a can of cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of mushroom soup mix that comes in an envelope, but instead of adding water to the soup mix I added whole milk, which made for a thicker consistency. Also, instead of the water as recommended in the recipe, I added whole milk again. For those wondering if they should add any salt to the beef when browning it, I recommend not adding any salt to it since the soup mix (whether it be by the can or the envelope) has plenty of salt to begin with.

Not bad. The beef pieces came out a bit tough as I heated the soup through. Next time I'll cook the beef medium rare and throw it in towards the end. Or leave the meat on the side and use the soup mix as a sauce over. Maybe serve it with a side of mashed potatoes.

my husband is a very picky eater and he couldn't tell there was dijon mustard in it. (otherwise he wouldn't even have taken a bite) he asked for second, you can't get better than that!

What a time saver recipe!  I recommend cutting the beef into desired bite sizes and mixing liquids together until well blended before adding to the chunkier meat and veggies mixture.  We served over egg noodles and loved every bite!

I loved it.  I am a beef stroganoff kind of girl and this was similar.  The dijon mustard added a new flavor!  Will be in my recipe box forsure!

This was good; mustard taste was not overwhelming, but it was strong. I'll make this again, but I may 1/2 the reccomended mustard. I liked serving this over rice.

For my review, it was easy and good.  I used 1/2 tbsp. less dijon than it called for, and it was plenty of mustard taste.  My 9 year old did not like the mushroom soup, so she cooked herself something else.  I guess I won't be using this recipe for another 9 years.  Oh well.

Neither my husband nor I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was very plain and needed more seasonings.  Next time I'd try to spice it up!

This recipe was excellent and very easy to make.  From the previous reviews, I had used about 1.5 tb of the Dijon since I am really not a mustard lover.  I served over brown rice and couldn't get enough.

Used cream of celery (that's all I had) and added a dash of Worcestershire sauce. Very quick and easy.

None of us (family of 5) really cared for this recipe... if I ever make it again in the future, I may try something besides dijon, maybe soy sauce or worchestershire?

We loved it. I doubled it, but I would suggest if you do, don't double the dijon.

Very easy and tasty! Mine was a slight variation: I used ground beef and about 1/2 cup milk instead of the water. The Dijon is  a great addition and you would never guess the sauce is basically just a can of soup.

This was a good homestyle meal.  I used egg noodles instead of rice and it turned out similar to beef stroganoff.  I will make again.

Simply delicious and fast! I didn't add any water, I just used the juices from the meat. I also added garlic to the meat as it cooked and used a can of Cream of Mushroom with Garlic (we love garlic in our meals). Other than that, I didn't change anything!

This has been a favorite in our house for quite sometime..When I first started making is I used the sirloin tip, but since have switched to stew meat and cut them down to smaller bites,and cook over low heat witha couple of cans of mushrooms, garlic, and seasoning salt, and the onions so pieces are tender and flavorable. I usually try to double the sauce part so it is like a suace for the rice. I do put soy sauce on the table. My picky eaters seem to do pretty good with it.  So I think its a keeper in this household

We didn't have dijon mustard on hand so we just used regular mustard, and it still turned out tasting really well. I also substituted the rice for egg noodles... I feel like that really made the dish :D

Excellent weeknight meal!  I used a ground grainy mustard in place of Dijon, and served it over buttered noodles...very comforting dish!

I rated this recipe 3 stars, because it did not have much flavor.  If someone can come up with other things to spice it up with please rate and give some tips.  It definitely has potential, not any of the other tips helped.  As with all the other recipes I always look at the reviews before making the dish.  This one missed the mark and our kids also gave it 3 stars.  First time I've ever had to give less that 5.

Wonderful!  The only changes I made was to use Zatarain's Creole mustard and I used more like 1/2 to 3/4 cups of water.  The creole mustard gave it a nice kick!
