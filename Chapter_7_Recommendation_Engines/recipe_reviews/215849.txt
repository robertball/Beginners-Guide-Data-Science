Simply delicious! This is very easy to throw together and perfect for a hearty weeknight meal. So if your're in the mood for Italian but think you don't have the time - think again. I added 1/2 lb. of sausage to the ground beef and onion along with some fresh minced garlic. And, to the sauce I added a little red wine and some Italian seasoning to give a bit of a flavor boost. The sour cream was a nice change from the usual ricotta cheese and I just eyeballed the other cheeses when layering. I covered it and baked it a little longer than 30 minutes leaving it uncovered for the last 10 minutes. Great with garlic bread and a salad!

very good with a few changes.  First I used sausage instead of ground beef.  Beef tends to be a bit bland for my tastes.  Then I sauted garlic, basil, oregano, rosemary, and a dash of cayenne pepper with the onion.  Otherwise kept it the same.  My 4 star rating is without the changes, 5 stars with them.  Very cheesy and flavorful that the whole family enjoyed.  Thanks for the basic recipe Colleen!

I followed this recipe exactly, and ended up making it again only two or three days later.  Absolutely delicious, I wouldn't change a thing!

Was a  "hit" with the family.  It is simple to make and quite tasty.  I added a little more cheese because everything tastes better with more cheese :). I also used penne pasta instead of ziti.

Very very tasty dish.  I used ground chicken instead of beef, added fresh chopped garlic with the onion and chicken, and omitted the provolone because I can't get that cheese in Belgium.

Very tasty. I used ground sausage instead of ground beef for a bit more flavor and it turned out awesome. For a healthier version use ground turkey sausage!!

This would have been amazing if I would have stuck to the recipe and used ground beef. I made the mistake of using hot italian sausage.

Omg! This was so good. My husband loved it. I did make some changes. I used turkey sausage, added a 3.5 oz jar of basil pesto to the sauce mix, and used ricotta instead of sour cream. So much flavor!

Was going to give this only three stars because, while good, it didn't really stand out. Just realized, however, that I only used one jar of pasta sauce and it really calls for two jars--missed it because recipe only references quantity in ounces, not jars. Maybe with 2 jars of sauce it would have been outstanding.

If you want a better tasting, more cost efficiant recipe. Skip the sour cream & provolone. Use 15-16 ounces of Ricotta instead. Also, rather than buying the mozzarella and parmesan seperately...try using the pre-packaged shredded italian mixture. Usually it comes with mozzeralla/parmesan. Stick with a traditional spaghetti sauce instead of the Classico. That way your baked ziti isn't tainted too much by the bold flavors in the Classico sauces. These traditional sauces are usually a little less expensive than the Classico anyway. After boiling the pasta...drain then mix pasta, ricotta and 1 egg together. The egg works well as a binder and makes the ricotta much fluffier and tastes great. Start layering with the sauce mixture first, that way you don't have to grease the pan.

Just took this out of the oven and it is fantastic!  I added two cloves of minced fresh garlic, Italian seasoning, parsley and garlic powder to the sauce mixture.  Also used the entire 8 oz. of both provolone and mozzarella cheeses.  Might try again with ricotta as I love it, but it's great as is.  So easy too and makes a ton!

This was really good. I used a package of dried sauce mix and made as directed, also I used dried minced onion and garlic and cooked them in with the meat and added a sprinkle of salt and coarse ground pepper. It was almost like lasagna except with ziti pasta. It is worth fixing again. Thumbs up from everyone at the table tonight, thanks!

This was awesome. I made this with Johnsonville ground Italian Sausage in place of the beef. Also added in an extra onion, some fresh garlic and used fresh marinara sauce. Superb!

Loved it!  Used Penne vs Ziti, and all Mozzarella since that's what I had on hand.  Great recipe - quantity is fantastic as I fed myself, the DH (Darling Husband) and three teenagers two bowls each and still had half the dish left over!  After reading the other reviews, I would be interested to try zucchini, pesto, ricotta, other spices, garlic etc., but I would make this again as is in a heartbeat.  Thanks for a keeper and a new family favorite!

Good basic recipe.  I made three primary changes:  (1) made my own sauce with canned crushed tomatoes, homemade chicken broth, tomato paste, onion, lots of garlic, basil, italian spices and my secret ingredient - shredded carrot - which sweetens the sauce. (2)  Used a leftover pork tenderloin which I gently sauteed/reheated in the freshly made sauce, &  (3) used Ricotta Cheese instead of sourcream.  Oh and I used a lot more Provolone & Mozarella than this recipe recommends.  The end result was rich, creamy and delicious.

This is a great recipe but I found a few adjustments made all the difference the second time I made it and it was healthier! :)
substitute 1 lb whole wheat penne, 48 oz of sauce (52 is too much!), 8 oz Sargento sliced provolone, 1 pkg of shredded Italian Cheese Blend instead of the mozzarella. I also added minced garlic to the meat/onion mixture for extra flavor.
This is a great dish paired with an all greens and oil/vin salad!

The whole family LOVED this but no one more than me!!!  By far the best baked ziti I've ever had.  I will probably never try another recipe.  :)

I pretty much followed the recipe except for the sauce.  I just used traditional sauce (I think it was Aldi brand) and added basil and garlic from the garden.  Yummy!

I made a half-recipe of this baked ziti for the 2 of us, and it was delicious. I couldn't stop eating it right from the pan after it came out of the oven.

I substituted fresh mozzarella (leftover from another recipe), thinly sliced, for the shredded mozzarella and layered the sliced mozzarella with the sour cream instead of the sliced provolone. Instead, I put the sliced provolone on top with the Parmesan.

Wonderful! I actually omitted meat altogether--extremely flavorful and easy to make!  Company loved it.  I really like the addition of sour cream instead of ricotta, added a rich flavor imo.  Will definately save and make again!

This recipe was delicious.  I used ground turkey breast instead of the ground beef.  I know that ground turkey breast has a tendency to be dry, so I added a tablespoon or so of water when it was just about browned/whitened.

This was not horrible, just not something I would make again. It did not have enough meat and sauce.  Also, the provolone and sour cream was kinda strange.

My husband is a big pasta fan. We both loved this recipe the first time I made it and if you look at more reviews it's very versitile! I will use a bigger pan than a 9x13 from now on. It was a tight sqeeze. I also took another member's suggestion and mixed some sauce with the bottom layer of pasta and it turned out great: smooth and creamy, not dry. I will definately make this again.

Great recipe. Husband hates ricotta cheese, so it was nice to have an alternative with baked ziti. Followed recipe except added a few spices to beef/sauce mixture. Other then that, exactly the same. Both my boys liked it and commented that it was good. Both picky eaters, especially my son. Will definitely make again.

This recipe is fantastic and was definately a crowd pleaser in my home. I'm Puerto Rican and tend to cook with a lot of flavor and spice. This wasn't bland at all... the only thing I added as many others have suggested is about 8 - 10 cloves of Garlic. I also sprinkled some salt & Pepper in the ground beef as it was browning. Otherwise, perfecto!

Very good, and very easy!  The sour cream is an interesting twist.  I followed the recipe exactly, and while we have leftovers, we won't mind enjoying it a few more times this week!  This would be a great potluck dish.

I cooked mine with a vodka sauce and substituted plain yogurt for sour cream with a dash of brown sugar for a more creamy taste....delicious!!!!

I substituted mozzarella cheese with pepper jack cheese, I wanted to try something different but not too crazy, it's so good it gives it a nice kick, I minus the provolone cheese and for the sour cream I added some milk to make it more creamy.

Like most, I use sausage and garlic as well.  I've made this recipe several times and it always disappears.

Excellent!  very scalable too - I doubled it for a big pre-race pasta dinner.
The only change I made was in the layering.  I mixed the sauce and pasta together, layered in pay, then added the sour cream (so it could ooze together), THEN the provolone.  

For extra meatyness - I topped with 12 golf-ball size meatballs before baking.  That was a little extreme...but enjoyed by everyone!

(I used Classico Four cheese and Classico Sweet tomato & basil)

I took a chance and baked not one but two of these baked zitis for my son's birthday party without making it and ever tasting it beforehand. I am so glad I did because this ziti was delicious!! I followed the recipe completely except for using a different brand of sauce and adding a teaspoon of sugar to the sauce as I like it to have a sweet flavor.  It was a hit at the party everyone kept commenting on how delicious it was.  I will definitely use this recipe again!
