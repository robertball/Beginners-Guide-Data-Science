This is just an old fashioned soft-boiled egg, but it's a new way of cooking it for me.  After the water came to a boil, I would just reduce the heat, and cook for 3 minutes.  Some times it worked, others not so much.  I think this is a fool-proof way to get perfectly cooked soft-boiled eggs once you get the time right.  I used large eggs right out of the fridge, brought the water to  boil, took the pan off of the stove and set the timer for 3 minutes (recipe says 2-4).  They cooked just a bit too long for us, so the next time I'll set it for 2 minutes/45 seconds.  As odd as this may sound, I thought cutting the toast into strips was genius, making them just perfect for dipping (just never thought about doing that).  This will be my go-to way of cooking soft-boiled eggs in the future.
