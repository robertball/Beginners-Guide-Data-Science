I cut the amount of sugar back by half and made my own pumpkin pie spice. I think the submitter might have made a mistake with the amount of pumpkin pie spice--instead of two tablespoons, I used two teaspoons.  These muffins turned out perfectly sweet, moist, chewy and very cold-weather happy food. EXCELLENT with a hot cup of coffee or cocoa. Four and a half stars.

These are great!  Just a couple of things to note.  I used a large cookie scoop for the batter and I only got 24 muffins out of it.  And just a helpful note, I used 1/4 t of cinnamon sugar on the top of each muffin and I thought it was just about right.

Next time I would probably make a struesel to put on top and maybe add some vanilla to the batter.  Regarding the previous review, I don't think the spice amount is a mistake.  I used the amount as written and they aren't over spiced at all.  They're very moist, but not mushy, and I think they'll be a big hit at work.  They'd be great with a cream cheese frosting as well :)

These just came out of the oven and smell wonderful and taste even better.  I used the full amount of spice in the dry mixture, cut the sugar by 1/2 a cup because I added about a cup and a third of chocolate chips, used egg beaters and replaced half of the oil with unsweetened applesauce.  I will not replace the oil again because the cupcakes really stuck to the muffin papers.  Texture wise, it was spot on though.  Not the fault of the recipe - I should have known with such a small amount of oil not to change it.  But that is my fault, not the recipe.  Oh, I made my own self rising flour (used the self raising flour recipe on this site) and it worked just fine. My muffin tins must be bigger than the submitter because I only got 22 muffins out of this recipe. The pumpkin flavor was balanced beautifully in this recipe and the addition of the chocolate chips enhanced the flavor even more.  We'll definitely have again!

Living in Canada we have all-purpose flour, so I had to add 2 tsp baking soda and 1/2 tsp baking powder. The spices are not a mistake, even though I made these today at the daycare I work for and due to cinnamon allergies I replace it with 1/2 quantity of cloves, they were beautiful and moist.added a few chocolate chips.

Love these! Followed the recipe, except for making up my own batch of pumpkin spice and these came out perfect! I also got 2 dozen like the other reviewers.

These were amazing! Light and fluffy. The only change I made was cutting back 1/2 cup of sugar in exchange for chocolate chips. Spices are NOT a mistake, I probably could have added more. Like another reviewer I used a large cookie scoop (love uniformity!) and got 24 muffins. My husband told me they were his favorite of all the pumpkin muffins I've made and I bake a lot.

This makes a tasty muffin. I used all purpose flour with 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, and 1 tsp salt. I also added 1 cup of raisins and a cup of chopped pecans.

Quick and good!  I did make changes based on what I had in my pantry.  I didn't have pumpkin, I had pumpkin pie mix.  It has sugar and spices, so I tasted and decided to add only one cup of sugar, but added a little more spice.  I also added chocolate chips.  We like very much!  Very mosit! I used a 1/3 cup scoop and made 24 muffins.

Unbelievably good. Was looking for a recipe to use the puree left from carving my Halloween pumpkin, about 2 cups--no reason to waste it, right? Wow. The only thing I changed was the seasoning amounts. I don't know if it was or was not a mistake, but 2 tablespoons of the pumpkin pie spice would have overwhelmed my personal tastebuds! I made my own pumpkin pie spice mix and used 2 teaspoons, as one reviewer mentioned previously; I thought that was perfect. I could still taste the flavor of my fresh pumpkin (again, wow), not just spices. Enhancing rather than dominating the flavor profile. Plan to freeze these (I got 18 muffins), as I have one more pumpkin to carve, and I will make another batch. Loved them!

These muffins are great! Used the whole amount of spice and it was perfect. I also reduced the sugar to 2 cups and they were still plenty sweet.  The recipe made 18 muffins and took  about 3 extra minutes to cook. Made a second time and subbed in garam masala  for the pie spice. They were great too, so if you want a change, give it a try. Still has all those "fall" flavors,  with a little different kick.

I make these all the time during the fall for my kids. They’re great! They’re always moist and sweet. Though, i don’t put the full 2 & 1/2 cups of sugar. I only use 2 cups.  Also, I’m only able to get about 20 muffins out of the recipe.

Loved this!  Got about 24 big muffins out of the batch. Before baking, we took a third and stuffed em with cranberries, and another third with chocolate chips. Delicious.

Btw I made a booboo and used all purpose, so we fixed it with 1 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp salt per cup of flour. They rose up just fine.

I will be making these a lot! I didn’t have pumpkin pie spice, so I guessed and used 2 tsp cloves, 1 tsp ginger, and 2 Tbsp plus 1 tsp cinnamon. I also subbed dark brown sugar for half the white sugar. They came out moist and flavorful and basically  delicious. I am told they’re even better with peanut butter on top.

This is a great recipe. The muffins come out light and fluffy. My 1st grader ate 3 in one sitting. The only thing I changed was I added more cinnamon, 2 tbs of vanilla and pumpkin pie spice
