Salt, yes it definitely needs salt. I add a French onion soup mix package in order to add the flavor that one typically gets from a more traditional pot roast from the faun (brown yumminess on the bottom of the pan from searing the meat first)long with an onion, cinnamon stick and celery stocks. Really wish I would have backed off on the cloves though.

The marinade needs salt and something else, though not sure what exactly the something else is. Maybe red pepper? There also should be onion in with the potatoes and carrots. I think those few changes would take it from so so to tasty.

Tough and bland. Recipe doesn't mention to save the cider marinade or to add it to the crockpot for cooking with the roast.  I tried a second time, adding ½ cup marinade to roast along with what others have suggested (salt, pepper, garlic, thyme & worchester sauce). Made it a little better but won't be using this recipe again.

My family really enjoyed this meal. I used spiced apple cider to add some additional flavor. Also added celery and onions.

This was ok.  It reminded us of the spices you would use for a ham.  maybe we'll  try that. Won't be making it again. I even added salt and cumin.

I made this. We were all excited about it as it sounds so delicious. But it wasn’t anything special at all. And to top it off, the glaze boiled over and ruined the finish in my glass top stove. So be careful.

This receipt was not what I hoped it would be. The vinegar overtook all flavors. I will not make it again.

This is honestly the worse pot roast Ever. My perpetually hungry husband who gobbles down everything I set before him said "Sorry honey ... but ... Please don't make this again".

I made this to take to a friend who can't eat anything with onions or hot spices.  I made a couple minor changes based on the other reviews.  Before marinating, I pierced the roast all over with a large 2-pronged meat fork.  I added a little salt to the marinade and marinated for 48 hours.  Since we live at a high altitude (6500 feet), I cooked it on high for half the time and then switched to low.  Of course, I let it rest for about 15 minutes before slicing for the juices to distribute.
It was surprisingly tasty even to my husband's and my palate which are used to much more spices in the cooking.  Our friend loved it and my husband asked me to make it again, giving it a 4 rating.

I really enjoyed mine but it's definitely missing something and I can't quite figure out what it is. I modified the recipe slightly. I added onions like another reviewer said. I also added a shallot. Not sure if this made much of a difference to be honest. I marinated for 24 hrs. I think it really needs 48 hours to really soak in the apple cider. My beef tasted slightly like apple but not as much as I would have liked. I also cooked in a slow cooker on high for about 5 hrs and then on low for about 2. The veggies definitely took on more of an apple cider flavor which was good. I hope more people try this and play with the recipe to find out how to perfect it. It's so close.

Good not great.  I ended up adding the whole package of gravy mix to add flavor.  The vegetables were not done, so skip that and make them separately.
