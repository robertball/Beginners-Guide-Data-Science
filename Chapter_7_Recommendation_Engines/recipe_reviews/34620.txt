This salad was excellent.  I made it because it sounded very healthy and tasty.  I did not use quite as much barley as the recipe states.  I used 3/4 c. barley and prepared it as directed on the box.  The rest of it I did just as the recipe says, but at the end I thought it needed a little something so I added about 1 teaspoon of Lawry's Season Salt.  It seemed to bring out the other flavors even more.  I made this for a family picnic and everyone seemed to like it.  The lemon gives it a nice tangy flavor, perfect for a hot day.

This was tasty -- made it for a potluck, where I was looking for something that wasn't Yet Another Pasta Salad.  I'm giving it 3 stars, but it could get to 4 with a little tweaking.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, though I was a little loose and sloppy with measurements.  I felt the thyme was a little overly present, and the onions could have been rather more present.  The lemon juice / olive oil dressing is mild but nicely balanced, but in general I felt like I was just wanting a little *more* of something, and the sweetness of the barley was a little pushy.  Possibly a little garlic?  Or replace the green onions with shallots?  Or leeks?  I'm also thinking a little bit of a tart crumbly cheese -- like a feta or sour goat cheese, or something in that world -- might be a nice addition.  If you haven't cooked with barley before -- I'd only done so once -- be aware that barley is a VERY sweet grain, even sweeter than wheat.  So feel free to use strongly flavored savory elements with it to balance out the sweetness.

I really enjoyed this salad. I made a few minor changes - I leftout the raw peppers since they bother me and added edamame and diced tomatoes and some red pepper flakes. I used some frozen roasted corn that I got at Trader Joe's and also added in some roasted garlic I had made.

Excellent!  Very fresh tasting.  I added lots of fresh parsley at the end and we all LOVED it here.  My son and I are big shrimp fans and I'm always on the lookout for tasty recipes so thanks!

I made only a few small changes, I used half the amount of corn called for and half the amount of green onions and upped the lemon juice in the dressing slightly due to personal tastes.  My husband and I loved it.

I wasn't quite sure if this was supposed to be served hot or cold.  I rinsed the barley in cold water before I tossed in the other ingredients.  I added some fresh lemon thyme.  I liked the taste and texture, but it didn't go over well with the husband and kids.

This recipe is quite tasty. I used "veggie shrimp" that I bought at Whole Foods because I'm a vegetarian. I added a hint of sugar, although it's just as tasty without. This is a light and healthy meal, side, or snack for a hot summer day.

I served this warm with lemon-garlic Mahi Mahi for dinner. I didn't put any shrimp in it. It was good and a nice change from rice or noodles. I also ate the leftovers cold the next day. The main change I made was to saute the bell pepper and onions in a little water to get the main crunch out of them--I don't really like raw bell pepper.

Sooo good! I loved the chewiness of the barley and the over-all mix of flavors.  I made this recipe farely close to as written only I used about twice as much lemon juice, because I love the citrus flavor. I even used fresh thyme, but I would recommend using less thyme than listed. I put in the small thyme leaves and felt like I was biting into a Christmas tree when I would get an entire leaf. Chop it finely! But next time I will use less thyme and try using dried thyme to see how the flavor compares. Over-all I loved the unique combination of textures and flavors!

I also didn't know if it should be hot or cold, so I put the barley in a large bowl, waited until it was more warm than hot, and then added the rest of the ingredients and the dressing (Instead of fresh thyme I used a little less than a half a teaspoon of dried thyme).

It was a little bland for my taste, but I did like the combination of flavours and textures. Next time I make this,  I will for sure double the lemon juice and perhaps marinate the shrimp in the dressing beforehand. 

I did like that you can get everything else ready while the barley is simmering.

Excellent! Based on the suggestions from others, I went easy on the thyme. I used a very little bit of dried thyme which I crushed fine before adding it to the salad. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. My husband’s unsolicited comment: “Don’t lose this recipe!”

I thought the mix of crab with the veggies was really good, but I have discovered that cold chewy barely just isn't a replacement for pasta.  For us the dressing was too acidic to be palatable and lacked the flavor boost this salad really needed.

I was too hungry to wait for my barley to cool, so I decided to make this recipe hot. I threw all the ingredients in my rice cooker except for the lemon juice, olive oil, and shrimp. I added some garlic and powdered corn soup mix, and pressed "cook." Forty-five minutes later, my meal was done! I tossed in the cooked shrimp, added a little salt and pepper, and enjoyed an awesome meal. I didn't end up needing to add the Olive oil or lemon juice; the lemon zest was perfect.
