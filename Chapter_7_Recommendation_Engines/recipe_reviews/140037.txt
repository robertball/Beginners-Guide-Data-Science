You are actually not suppose drain the water out of the ravioli! It is suppose to be like creamy soup! So I would say use one ladle of the water and as little or as much yogurt as you would like. Sorry it got left out!

I have never eaten Turkish food before, but am always game to try something new.  Maybe it is an acquired taste, but this was not to my liking.

If you make the yogurt/garlic mixture a few hours ahead and leave it in the fridge it's tastier.  I also mix the mint into the yogurt.  My mother-in-law uses a bit of tomato sauce heated in olive oil instead of the butter/paprika.  I've had it both ways and prefer the tomato sauce/olive oil more.    Ravioli is a good substitute but real Manti makes a difference.  Living in Turkey we can get all different kinds and they are delicious.  If you have the opportunity to get the original, try it.

I'm sure real manti would be even better, but this is a quick, easy and delicious way to fix frozen beef ravioli.  I only used 6 oz. of yogurt because that's the size the whole milk brand I found comes in.  It was plenty to give the pasta a nice coating.
Update:  I've now been to Turkey and had real manti...where I was they did drain them.  Manti are really tiny, but the ravioli are a fair substitute, taste-wise.  I still think this is a great recipe. Thanks again, Dana!

I didn't like this at all. I thought it sounded similar to a dish I had in a turkish restaurant and loved but it tasted nothing like it.

When we tried it, it was a little bland, so we added more paprika, salt and pepper at the table.  Once it was a little spicer, it had a great flavor!  Very easy, would make it again.

Very easy. I left the water off the ravioli and just spooned the yogurt(i heated it first) on it thick then the butter. I made my own ravioli with crab, cheese tomato and pesto, so the yogurt was perfect to soften the ravioli spices.

I've been missing authentic manti since I moved back to the US from Turkey a few years ago! My cooking skills are limited, but this recipe tasted spot on and was super easy to make.

Here were the changes I made: 
- I used lowfat plain yogurt (to cut some calories) and mixed the dried mint leaves in with the yogurt instead of the ravioli.  
- I kept some of the water from the ravioli so the yogurt was creamier.  
- I added cayenne and a half teaspoon of tomato sauce to the butter/paprika mix
- I also used half the butter and used chicken broth for the other half to make it a bit healthier.
- I'll try frying the ravioli next time, this is also a common option in restaurants in Turkey!

Afiyet olsun!

This recipe is extraordinary and so easy.  I made a few changes.  I used fresh mint instead of dried and put a sprig in the pasta water and two teaspoons, chopped, into the Greek yogurt.  I cut the butter in half to 2 tablespoons.  It is delightfully garlicky, which I love.  Highly recommend it.
