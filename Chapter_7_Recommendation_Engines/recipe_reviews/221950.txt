Just made this for dinner tonight.  Delicious!  I wasn't prepared to make it, so had to do some substitutions.  (White onions for green onions, more soy sauce for the fish sauce)  Even with the substitutions, this spicy dish was superb served over brown rice.

Really good! I omitted the water after a first try because it's a lot easier to reduce the sauce. I like to use Thai chili sauce instead of Jalapenos because I always have it on hand, that way I can really slam it together if I get the urge.

WOW, this is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!! My thighs were pretty big, so I cut my pieces a bit smaller. The flavors here are perfect! This could not have been easier to make, but it really seems like you spent some time in the kitchen. Served this over jasmine rice. I will be making this over and over, which is not gonna be good for my waistline, lol...SOOOO GOOD, and definitly worthy of more than 5 stars~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Chef John, I'd like to meet you some day and give you a big ol' hug!  I love the way you cook.  I made this for my boys and everyone was amazed by how good it was.  And for such a simple dish, it had a really complex flavor that knocked all our socks off!
The recipe is versatile enough to accommodate what you have on hand, or for your personal tastes.  I didn't have fish sauce, so I substituted with about a teaspoon of anchovy paste in 1/3 cup soy sauce.  The fresh jalapeno didn't appeal to me, so instead, I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes.  The key ingredients for the sauce are the soy/fish sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, garlic and ginger.  If you start there and add/subtract what you like/don't like, this will always be a hit.
For those of you who had trouble getting the sauce to thicken; this dish must be cooked on high heat for the entire cooking time in order to achieve the right caramelization on the chicken and to get the sauce to reduce.  I used the entire amount of water called for and my reduction took between 10-15 minutes.  The sauce will bubble and foam.  That's ok.  That's what you're looking for to get it to reduce.  Don't be afraid of how hard it boils.  Let it do what it do!!!
DO NOT USE BREAST MEAT!  Boneless, skinless thighs can withstand the high temperatures required to make this dish.  Breast meat will dry out way before your sauce is properly reduced.
Fantastic with a side of steamed broccoli with a bit of the sauce drizzled over it.  YUM!!

This was so good.  I really can't say enough good things about it. Only made 3 changes, I used oyster sauce instead of fish (just what I had) no cilantro no one likes it, and no jalapeno (didn't have any)!  I will make this again!

4 1/2 Stars- but I'll round up! Seriously one of the best Asian Chicken recipes I've ever made. The chicken was a perfect combination of sweet and spicy, the 1/2 star I took off was because I found the recipe a bit too salty.  I'm sure this will probably vary depending on the brands of soy/fish sauce you use.  I would start light on both then add if needed.  I made half a recipe for my boyfriend and I with a side of sesame green beans and brown rice. I was worried it wouldn't be enough food as I only had 3 chicken thighs, but it was perfect, if not too much food.  I had no troubles with the liquid ratio, but I did have a big pan with not much meat (and a gas stove). I would tend to think that maybe the people who are having trouble may be overcrowding the pan.  All in all this is a wow-worthy recipe, definitely suitable for company. I'll be making this again!

(I thought) I followed the recipe exactly and it took an hour for the sauce to reduce!  We eventually ate and everyone loved it (or maybe everyone was just starving).  I will try it again and omit the water.  I cooked it in a wok...maybe that was my problem /:

I am ONLY reviewing the sauce because I went in a different direction with my chicken. I used rotisserie chicken thighs and French cut green beans and almonds. I made the sauce exactly as written and just reduced it down, then added my chicken, green beans and almonds to heat through. Served over brown Jasmine rice with egg rolls on the side. The sauce is *wonderful* and would be good on just about any Asian-inspired sauce you chose to use it in. I will definitely make this again, maybe even as written sometime! But I dunno, my version is going to be hard to beat. :-)

Very good. So easy and tastes so good. I cut the chicken into smaller pieces and finished off the dish under the broiler.  (My skillet is oven proof.)  This recipe is a keeper.

I've made this recipe twice now and really like it.  The other reviewers are correct - the added water makes the caramelization process take forever. Therefore if you add the full amount of water, cut your chicken in larger pieces so you won't overcook.  Watch the jalapenos because the second time I got some that were extra spicy from the international market (even with seeds removed) and we almost couldn't eat it.

I did everything exactly as indicated in the recipe and it blew me away. This dish was tasty and looked great on the plate served over white rice. I'll be making it again and again! Thanks again, Chef John!

Delish! Didn't have dark brown sugar, so I used light brown sugar and added a little molasses. Next time, and there will be a next time, I'm adding a little red pepper flakes to give it some heat.

Hi this is the first recipe I've ever rated, and I'm a fairly decent cook, but I have to say that this came out restaurant quality.  I didn't have fish sauce so I just substituted for soy sauce, I also didn't have jalepenos so I added quite a few hits of Siracha sauce and one pinch of red pepper flakes to give it a kick.  I also didn't have chicken thighs so I grilled up some boneless-skinless chicken breasts, sliced them when cooked and tossed them in the sauce after it had been reduced.  If you start the chicken on the grill at the same time as the sauce and rice you should have no problem for the length of time other users commented about the sauce reducing, and then everything finishes at the same time.  I did cut up some green onion after I took the chicken dressed in the sauce off the heat, and finished with some toasted sesame seeds. Yum! I couldn't believe how easy this was to make given how fantastic the sauce comes out.  I will be making this one again and again!  THANKS so much for sharing!

So very tasty!  I've made the recipe to the T, as well with a few modifications and it always turns out fantastic. To ensure the sauce comes out nice and thick in a timely fashion, I drain the liquid from cooking chicken in the pan before I add the 1/3 c sauce. Then I whisk some cornstarch into the remaining sauce. The salt in the various sauces can add up so I use low sodium soy sauce. When I've not had fish sauce I've used Pad Thai sauce. When the chicken is done cooking, I've put it on a cookie sheet and let it sit under the boiler for a few minutes, which further caramelizes it & gives a little bit of a crispier texture. I usually serve with Basmatti rice.

This was really good.  Hubby, who hates sweet main dishes, said "Don't lose this recipe.  It tastes like the stuff from the Thai restaurant."  The balance of sweet, salty, spicy was perfect.  After reading all the reviews I did cut the water down to 1 tablespoon but otherwise did not change a thing.  The cooking times were just right.  The sauce was a golden, sticky, spicy and delicious!

My first Chef John's recipe ever.. This was a little time consuming for me.. I bought 3.5lbs of chicken and had a lot of trimming to do. I doubled the recipe for I was feeding 7 ppl. Turns out I didn't need all that sauce. Didn't have fish sauce or peanuts, but still flavorful. It went over a bed of brown rice. I will make this again!

Oh wow, this was fantastic!! I'm eating, no, savoring the leftovers for lunch right now. I used oyster sauce instead of fish and regular brown sugar vs. dark. I skipped the green onions and added red pepper flakes, used minced garlic instead of cloves and ground ginger instead of fresh. Served with the Easy Bok Choy recipe from this site and white rice. This is a definite keeper, thanks Chef John!!!!

Delicious! Fabulous!! Only substitution I made was cutting up chicken breasts instead of using thighs because it was what I had. The breast chunks were a little tough, so don't overcook, but the sauce was amazing. Excellent recipe, Chef John!!

Great dish! Flavorful and quick. Used regular brown sugar as I did not have the dark. Did not have the fish sauce or the peanuts but it did not matter. Will be cooking this again!

Chef John is my favorite recipe source and I always enjoy his recipes.  This recipe was very good, but a bit salty for my taste.  I used 3 Crabs fish sauce.=

This was the bomb! And so easy!! Chef John doesn't recommend breast meat but that was what I had. So, I made the sauce, removed 1/3 cup to caramelize when cooking the chicken and reduced the rest before starting the chicken. Adding the already reduced sauce cut down on cook time so the breast meat remained moist. Don't forget the peanuts & scallions! They make an already amazing dish even better. I did use fresh flatleaf parsley instead of cilantro. Thanks, Chef John, great dish!

Another fantastic, no-hassle recipe by Chef John. Made exactly as written. When making this again, we might tweak the brown sugar mixture to slightly tone down the sweet & salty tastes but it’s already close to perfection. Watch the video as it provides a few helpful tips, especially about caramelizing the chicken. Chef John’s creative artistry, user friendly recipes, and instructional videos can make just about anyone a great cook if able to follow his simple instructions. Chef John, your contributions are widely admired.

Yum! And quickly joining the ranks as a favorite stand-by dinner. Follow the recipe exactly, it's wonderful. This was the first time I used fish sauce. When I opened the bottle, and smelled it I was very hesitant, thinking I was about to destroy my food. But I buckled down, trusted Chef John, and  it was totally worth it. Its a keeper.   Btw-if you can't get the chicken to caramelize you may need a wider, shallower pan. Luck.

First I marinaded bone-in chicken thighs in the sauce for a few hours, then removed the chicken from the marinade, dredged the pieces in a mix of flour and New Mexico red chile powder, then pan fried in olive oil until browned on both sides. I then added shitake mushrooms and the remaining marinade, then let it come to a boil for about 10 minutes. I then added bok choy and napa cabbage and simmered. I then removed a little of the sauce from the pan and spooned it into a measuring cup, mixed in some potato starch as a thickener, and added mirin wine to the chicken and vegetable mixture and let it cook down. I then added the thickened sauce and some cooked rice noodles, allowing the flavors to meld over low heat for another 10 minutes or so. Incredibly delicious!

Another winner from Chef John :-)  And another recipe where the list of ingredients is wrong :-(  In the video, he makes a point of saying 1t of Soy Sauce because the Fish Sauce makes it sufficiently salty.  The ingredients say 1T of Soy Sauce.  Glad he pointed it out in the video - saved me from overly salty dinner.  Chef John is absolutely wonderful and we love his all his recipes.  Once again suggesting however that he consider having someone proof read the posted recipes for him.

This was the best recipe I have tried from this place in a long time.  I used the ingredients exactly as specified, except, believe it or not, my Kroger was out of jalapenos. I used some Anaheim peppers but of course they are not as hot, so I added a little red pepper flake.

As others have said, watch the video before you make this and you will get some good tips and a feeling for what the chicken should look like in the first step.  Make sure you use plenty of heat on the stove.  It took me a little more than 12 minutes to get it caramelized.   You are looking for a mahogany color and caramel starting to stick to the pan, with most of the liquid gone.  

Served over brown rice.  Will definitely make again.  The video warns you not to substitute chicken breasts as they tend to dry out.  I'm glad I went with the thighs as directed.  Very moist and flavorful.

Very important to carmelize the chicken, it seriously changes the texture  and flavor of the entire dish.

DELICIOUS!!! I made it for my roommates and they loved it! I followed the recipe exactly (minus the peanuts and fish sauce 'cause I didn't have any) and it turned out great! 
***WARNING: This is a somewhat-difficult and long recipe to make if you are using fresh items and are following the recipe exactly. Be prepared to be cooking for 1 1/2 hours. With that said, IT IS SOOOOO WORTH IT!***

Here are some recommendations when cooking:

1) FISH SAUCE SUBSTITUTE: .25 cup soy sauce + 1 tablespoon Worcestershire Sauce + 1 tablespoon fresh squeezed lime/lemon juice

***NOTE*** Nothing bets the funky flavour of real fish sauce. The substitute is an alternative, not a exact replacement for its flavour.

2) STEP 3: There is alot of sauce here. Use only 1/4 of sauce (AND NO MORE THAN THAT!!!) to caramelize the chicken, and put the remaining 3/4 in a saucepan to boil at the same time. Once the chicken begins caramelized, pour a ladle-full from the saucepan onto the chicken, wait until sauce has thickened until desired, and repeat until all sauce from the saucepan is gone. 

3) FRESH CILANTRO IS CLUTCH TO THIS RECIPE! It really cuts through the flavour and gives you a fresh palate for the next bite. I suggest you cut the whole leaves in half before garnishing.

4) Serve on white rice ONLY!!! I would explain it if I could, but I can't. You must use white rice for this meal. Nothing else works as well.

5) WATCH THE VIDEO FOR THIS RECIPE!!! It really helps when cooking.

Bon appetit!

Made this tonight and followed the recipe to a T.  OMG it was out of this world.  The sweet, tangy, spicy, and salty flavors were perfectly blended.  All of the well-chosen Asian ingredients give this recipe a professional flare. I will definitely be making this again.

We didn't have cilantro or green onions.  I had to sub pecans for the peanuts and it was still good. I was worried the jalapeno wouldn't really match the other flavours and I think it added just the right kick!  I did find it very sweet so I may cut the sugar to 1/2 cup next time.
I will make this again very soon. So glad to have this recipe.

Just fantastic!  Pretty easy, and amazingly good.
Trying my second time tonight-- last time, the sauce was a little runny, so I'll cut down on the water.

i didn't have any jalapenos, cilantro, or peanuts so i just made the sauce with the ginger and garlic. it was a little too sweet and it took longer than 20 to make even with my stove on high to get the liquid to thicken, even with added a little of the sauce first to thicken. But, it was still good just a little to sweet, maybe i just needed the spicy to balance the sweetness.

WOW - I followed the recipe as written and thought this dish was AWESOME.  I cant wait to have company to show this off to.  I think that the fish sauce and jalepenos are necessary to make this dish taste right.  The fish sauce is easy to come by ($2.99 at my regular grocery) and even tho I didnt eat the jalepenos, they made the sauce just the right amount of spicy. 

Thanks Chef John

awesome!  just made this using the 6 serving list and this is excellent. Just as Chef John detailed in his video....easy to make too. I cut up chicken, onions, jalapenos earlier in the day to save some time but it's really not that involved anyway. 
I even used low salt peanuts and low sodium soy sauce just to keep salt content as low as possible and served over rice.

A keeper.

Need to flour the chicken, as well as add to sauce at the end-makes for a thicker sauce.  Have been making a recipe pretty close to this one & it has NEVER failed me.  It was the 1st dish I cooked my boyfriend for dinner, & he saw what a great cook I was.  Soon to be married after 8 years!!! Restaurant quality!!!!!

Wow! How delicious is this! Chef Jon knocks it out of the park with this one. Before it's all cooked and combined there's an off smell about all those ingredients in one place. However when cooking and you finally add the dry ingredients it all really comes together and the smell is amazing! Just make this. It's worth it.

Holy Smoke. This is stunning, amazing, hot and spicy. So pleasurable. Followed the advice to eliminate water. Substituted powdered cayenne for jalapenos only because I thought had some...and didn't. After helping myself to a plate I served it up in a baking dish on brown rice. My husband thinks if it's in a casserole dish it must be something his mother shared with me. HAHA.

Made exactly as written, and this was delicious! I served the caramel chicken over rice.  Everyone in my family enjoyed this, so I believe it was well balanced in sweet, salt, and spice areas.  Those having trouble with liquid absorption, you must keep your pan on "high" heat through the cooking process and add the liquid two different times, as noted in the directions.  I cooked this in my extra large cast iron skillet and it caramelized exactly as suggested. Look forward to making again, thanks Chef John!

Thanks Chef John for another simple and delicious chicken recipe. This is easy to make, inexpensive,  and good enough for company. Make a little extra because it is even better reheated the next day for lunch. I'd make it more often but it is high in calories, so we save it for special meals.

My six-year old ate it, but it was way too salty for me.  I didn't have peanuts, so I used slivered almonds and sprinkled more in after I realized how salty the chicken was.  I'd adjust the fish sauce/tamari measurements and add unsalted peanuts or cashews plus green beans or something veg next time.  I had roasted romanesco and it went well with the dish when I mixed it in to cut the saltiness of the chicken.

Chef John is the best!  I love all his recipes, but this one stands out as spectacular.  It's so easy, and the flavors are marvelously complex and rich.  We practically licked our plates.  I did not, and would not, change a single thing.  This blows away any of those syrups full of junk in a bottle.  Thank you Chef John.

I always try a recipe the first time by following the directions exactly, which is what I did here. Only left out the peanuts as they seemed stale when I pulled them out of the pantry. This was fantastic and truly restaurant quality. I loved it and my gourmet-in-in-the-making ten year old was raving about it. He said it smelled wonderful while cooking, said it looked great before he tried it, and then followed that with a Woohoo and requests for seconds and thirds. If that is not a win.... Don't know what is. Even hubby who hates ethnic dishes of all kind and usually answers in the negative when I ask "should I make this again" said it's ok. At my house this is the best I can expect for a new recipe. Next time doubling the quantity to have leftovers for lunch. Do watch the video, and if you like a mix of sweet and salty with a bit of spice, go for it. Some of the commenters who left negative reviews said it was sweet... Well, look at the ingredients! And as far as salt goes, I use a low sodium tamari instead of regular soy sauce in all my recipes, and it is great.

Beautiful flavours, A few changes helped. Cooked chicken in all brown sugar mixture until done , removed chicken and thickened sauce with 2 teaspoons of cornflour in 50ml of water. Then added final spices and returned chicken.

This recipe is delicious!  My husband and two boys loved it and gave it two thumbs up :)  My 3-year-old said it was better than macaroni and cheese ... that's quite a compliment :)

Watch the video!  It helped me make the dish perfectly.  I didn't add the water, per other reviewer's suggestion and it turned out great. I think the water would have made it take forever to reduce.

well, i watched the video before making, but maybe i shouldn't have.  i started cooking the chicken; added a third of the sauce as mentioned.  the chicken gave off so much water (and i used organic if that makes a difference) that i wound up spooning out a ton of water, along with the sauce.  had to do that a couple of times.  so, after the pan was sufficiently dry, i added the rest of the sauce.  it took about another 10 - 15 mins for the sauce to thicken and brown the chicken. i didn't have or add peanuts or the green onions.  i had to use 'rooster sauce' for the heat.  we all liked it so i may make it again.

My sister made this when I was there for a visit.  It was so amazingly delicious!  The only change she made was to reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup.  She served it over brown rice.  I had the left overs for lunch the next day, and they were fabulous!

We didn't use the fish sauce, jalapeno, or cilantro, and I substituted some dried chives for green onions since we aren't fans of uncooked onions anyway. I added a can of cubed pineapple to make it more similar to my favorite Chinese restaurant dish, and it was great.

This was really good.  I would use 3 peppers instead of 2 but it all depends on how spicy you like your food:)  I would probably only use half of what's called for water.  I added some more brown sugar to thicken the sauce.  I also kept the peanuts until the very end and used them as garnish along with the cilantro.  It was crunchy, sweet and spicy.  

I took precooked and cooled rice and fried it in a pan with sesame oil, lemon grass paste and green onions.  It was the perfect match! Super easy recipe and tastes amazing! - Jason

I made this last night and here are a couple of things I learned:
1)It’s pretty delicious.

2)Definitely watch the video first- Chef John gives the reassurance that you cannot really burn this but you can quit too soon.  The difference between the point I started to get nervous (hot bubbling molten lava)  and 2 minutes more on high heat was a DELICIOUS caramel crunch. IF you wimp out too soon won’t have the mahogany color and deep flavor you want. (per video)

3)Don’t put too much sauce in with the chicken- I added a touch too much and it took a while to get to kind of the dyrish syrup stage and caramelize the chicken.  

4)Add all the jalapeño.  I only added one (and we like spicy) and for our taste the dish can handle all the  heat- as it’s really the  sweet, salty and spicy that  makes this exceptional. 

5) Make extra and freeze it. This should freeze wonderfully- and easy enough to reheat and add the fresh ingredients at the end.

Thank you Chef John!!  My family loved this.  I tasted it before I served it and I thought it was to sweet, but once you put it over rice, the rice cuts the sweetness. I'm a baker so I packed the brown sugar, next time I won't and see what the family says. This recipe is easy and packs lots of compliments.

Loved it!  Used sweet peppers instead of jalapenos, hot peppers are not allowed here.  I did have more liquid than I thought I would, as the juices from the chicken were more than the 1/3 cup of brown sugar mixture that I added, but I just cooked it longer until it finally got down to syrup consistency.  That added a good 25 minutes to the cooking time.  It was a little too salty, next time I'll use unsalted peanuts.

All in all it was good but a bit too salty for me. Maybe less fish sauce. I know the cilantro is garnish but I did enjoy eating it with the chicken to offset the salt and add a nice fresh taste.

I followed it exactly, including having the 1/3 cup of water. I had no problems with it reducing as other reviewers had. It is a super easy recipe and definitely, definitely, definitely cook this on HIGH. Don't reduce the temperature at all until you get the consistency of the sauce that you want. Watch the video, it is extremely helpful as well.

Loved it! Excellent recipe! Served over jasmine rice. Made as directed, didn't really "caramelize" but nonetheless delicious and easy to make. I might double the sauce next time to have some extra to serve over the rice. The jalapeño peppers added the spicy kick that we love. Will definitely make again!!!

Used oyster sauce instead of fish sauce, 1 1/2tsp of chilli flakes instead of jalepenos, white onions instead of green onions (added in the beginning).  For more flavor add a little more garlic, ginger and soy sauce.

Really good as written. I did have an issue with reducing the sauce...my error. I doubled the recipe and tried to cook it all in a wok. Too crowded. Had to drain the chicken several times to remove natural juices, remove 1/2 the chicken and cook in two shallow pans... then no problem. I let my 8 and 10 year olds watch the video and cook the second time we had it. Its that easy. Also husband and I did low carb it by serving over shredded cabbage and topping with bean sprouts. Next time over califlower rice. This is a keeper

What an amazing recipe. Might be the best chicken I've ever made. In fact, it's only 8am and I'm craving it right now! A lot of reviewers said they couldn't get the chicken to caramelize, so here's the secret: you have to cook it a long time before you add the sauce. More than 6-7 minutes. (If you use thighs, overcooking won't be a problem. Chicken breasts won't do well with this recipe.) Cook until the chicken is seared a dark brown and the sauce sticks to the bottom of the pan. I didn't have jalapeño so I added a little red pepper, but not too much as I have a 6 yr old. I also took other reviewers' advice and didn't add water. All four of my kids loved this recipe as much as I did.

Great recipe: easy to make, great flavor! I will make this over and over.  I had a few subs just based on what I had on hand (soy for fish sauce, sriracha for jalepenos and a spoon of peanut butter for peanuts). I omitted the water like some other readers as well. I also added some sliced sweet red pepper  with the chicken.  I imagine you could make a little extra sauce and add a whole bunch of veggies and it would be fabulous.

I was very excited to try this recipe.  We love Asian foods of all variety and this looked and sounded great.  I'm clearly in the minority on this one, but we found this to be very sweet.  Too sweet.  I followed the recipe faithfully.  After the first few bites, I chopped another bunch of green onion and tossed that in. That helped but not enough.  We still found the sweetness to be overpowering, almost cloying.  Perhaps adding something like broccoli would help cut that, but as it is we won't be repeating this recipe.

I made this and both Hubby and 2 year old loved it! I did leave out the jalapenos, because I didn't have any, but in the future would add probably 1  even with the baby eating it.  
I served it with coconut rice and sauteed cabbage, that was a great suggestion!!  
In reading the reviews and  because I used 10 big thighs rather than 8 it did take a lot longer for the chicken to cook and the sauce to thicken... Seriously, I thought some of the thighs were breasts.. except they had plenty of flavor, which breasts don't

This will go into regular rotation, as it was easy, the sauce cooked up beautifully and the peanut cilantro topping was so pretty that  really wanted to take pictures.  I did chop the cilantro and stir it in a bit rather than simply leave it on top...same with the peanuts. 5 stars!

This was really good.  I watched the video since some people mentioned that it was helpful in getting the sauce to come out right.  I didn't have fish sauce so subbed oyster sauce.  Instead of jalapenos, I sliced two bell peppers (going for kid friendly).  At the end, I added a bit of Thai chili sauce for spice (to the dishes of the people in the family who like some kick to it) since I'd skipped the jalapenos.  Will definitely make again.

Based on the reviews on this recipe, I took a chance and made it for company without a test run.  Chef John did not let me down!  Rave reviews.  I was asked for the recipe, which I was quite happy to share!   :o)  I discovered that Chef John has many recipes on here, so I will definitely be finding more "new favorites".  My husband even said to me: "Thank you for finding that recipe....it's delicious!  Definitely a keeper."  Thank you, Chef!

This recipe was pretty good!...but I got tired of eating it later on since I used to eat something similar to this. My sister loved it and was jealous of my cooking. I didn't had rice vinegar so I didn't use any substitution for that. As for dark brown sugar, I didn't had any so I used white sugar with 3 tiny drops of honey. I finished cooking the chicken in 6 minutes in a heavy skillet. Oh I used 1 chicken breast instead of chicken thighs. Also I used a variety nuts that I got from Costco and then I crushed them up in a sandwich bag. 

P.S. I did two servings of this instead of 4.

Oh my heavens, this is good!  A new family favorite.  I served it with SILVREZS Asian Coconut Rice, which is also amazing and a new family favorite.

Thank you for sharing your recipes Chef John.  I look forward to trying your other recipes.

Loved this dish.  I really like spicey food so next time I make it I will add 1 or 2 more jalapenos.   This will be added to my regular rotation.

If there were 10 stars I'd give it that.  This is excellent!  It's easy to prepare, easy to cook and tastes like it took much longer.  I served this with couscous, but next time I think Jasmine rice would be better.  

I can see making this once every couple of months.  The dear ones just loved this.

This was really good. I had to make a couple of minor substitutions (cilantro paste in the final cooking stages - which was delightful, and Thai garlic/chili sauce rather than jalepenos. I did cut back one clove of garlic in the sauce due to the garlic/chili sauce addition). It was seriously yummy, and would be so open to other creative additions, like mango and peppers to create a stir-fry.

Made this tonight for dinner and it was good.  I may make it again, but the liquid was like water and never thickened.  Quite frankly I have to wonder how such a watery marinade would miraculously thicken so I added a couple of tablespoons of arrowroot that did the trick.  To me it's like other chicken stir-fry type dishes I make.  My husband liked it a lot.  It was good, but not a wow for us.

Super crazy easy and really good flavor! I added a tablespoon of tapioca starch after adding the remaining sauce to the chicken, and the sauce thickened beautifully. The peanuts and green onions add a great texture to it, too.

Wonderful dish!  It took me awhile to caramelize it so next time I will dry the chicken off so it takes less time to reduce.

I followed the directions on the video to the letter.  I noticed the written instructions were not the same as the video's.  In the video he did not give a time duration on when the mixture will reduce, which took me about 20 minutes to reduce.  This also gives the chicken time to cook through and give it a little color, so don't omit the water like others have been suggesting.  Give this dish about 45 minutes to complete start to finish.

This was my first time cooking with fish sauce - just a heads up, it smells bad!  But apparently it tastes good, because this recipe is great.   I added a bit of sriracha sauce to the mix, and I think next time I'm going to add more ginger.  I'm trying to recreate Pei Wei's old caramel chicken recipe, and I've found the technique.  Now it's just refining the ingredients!

It came out OK, tasted good, but I almost burned it and the chicken was doner than I like.  I don't like cooking on high heat - I'll use a lower temp next time.

A tad sweet but really good. Cooked the chicken with all the sauce at once. Took maybe 1/2 hour to carmelize on high in a large cast iron skillet.

Fantastic! Doubled everything, used more garlic and threw in 3 multi-colored peppers in during that last step so they can cook in the sauce for 3 minutes. Served over white rice... and I like to put a few carrot chips on top for more color and vegetables. Very, very good. Made twice now and will make again!

We loved this dish.
The sauce didn't thicken that much so I added a little corn starch which did the trick. It was very good.  I wonder if there's anyway to cut down on the brown sugar and/or add a sugar substitute?

I love to cook stir fry and this is one of my new favorite dishes.  I cut back on the Jalapeño for the GF.  Didn't think of eleminating the water so I used corn starch to help thicken the sauce toward the end.  Also cut the chicken into bite size.  Excellent dish.

why change perfection - this is SO AWESOME - family request - just follow directions and as chef John says - HAVE NO FEAR - it does take courage to set heat as high as it requires - but - just do it !  oh yea - OMIT WATER - and it WILL cook faster and better.

Awesome. pretty much just followed the directions down the page and got an amazing main dish for four at the end. Really easy to make, and very satisfying. Served them with Chef John's five-spice carrots and rice.

So good! Followed the recipe and video, except left out the water. Make sure the burner heat is on high to caramelize. Restaurant quality!

My only tip is don’t be shy about bringing up the heat at the end to carmelize the sauce quickly. Otherwise the slow heat will overlook the chix.

This was delicious! I only used half of the fish sauce because I don't care for it and it was just right.  I also added 1/2 tsp. Crushed red pepper flakes.  Served over rice.  Definitely a keeper.

Oh... my... GOODness! Seriously! Try this! A definite keeper. Try it as it is the first time. I’m usually someone who tweaks new recipes to fit what I THINK will be more to my liking the first time around, but this one, I tried out true to form and it was just delicious.  Thank you, Chef John!

Filipino/Asian fish sauce is too strong for this recipe. I also scaled back  the brown sugar and added carrot slices and in the past have added vegetables.

If you're familiar with FIlipino cuisine, I would say that this comes out like our cured breakfast pork dish, tocino.

After making this a few times, I've changed the recipe. I cook the chicken in a little sauce first, remove it, and set it aside. I then add the veggies and let that cook down before adding the chicken. I sometimes add carrots, ginger (almost always), or diced tomatoes (at the end) and I make about 50% more sauce.  It's in our monthly rotation.

The sauce took forever to reduce. I was busy doing other stuff while it cooked. And I had to time the other stuff bc it was my daughter's school work and they do have to have a time on it. Took over an hour. But the sauce was yummy.

Every time I make a new Chef John dish, I say I have a new favorite and this recipe no exception. I made it exactly as directed (make sure to watch the video for both more detailed instruction and for Chef John’s humor). My husband and I try not to eat carbs at dinner time, but per chef’s recommendation, we ate it with sticky white rice and it was delicious! I might add another jalapeño or some chili paste next time because we like spicy food. Definitely a keeper!

Fantastic flavor in the end.  First time I made it, it would not thicken in the carmelization process, so I tweeked recipe to include cornstarch.  Second time, I definitely decreased fish
sauce to 1/4 c as it was too salty.  AND I decided to watch the video on advice of one of the reviewers, and it varies from recipe instructions in a detrimental way.  Third time was a charm, extremely fantastic palette of flavors.  Of course rice, and  baked veggies as side. MMMMMM

This recipe was a hit for the entire household, even the teenage boy who eats cereal for supper if it's not in his usual wheelhouse.  The sauce took longer to turn syrupy than the recipe states. I took the chicken out for awhile until the sauce cooked down and then put the chicken back in. Will  make again!

5 Stars!! We love this recipe, watch chef Johns video for great tips and tricks! I make this on a regular basis..and it’s my old mans favorite! I always go by recipe as written but...This week I was out of rice vinegar and didn’t realize it till I was cooking so I substituted with apple cider vinegar and it was great too. Hope this helps! Thanks Chef John!

Make sure you use chicken THIGHS.  I made the mistake of using breast,  and in order to get the sauce "carmelized" I had to cook it longer and the chicken breast was overcooked.  In hindsight I should have pulled the chicken out to finish the sauce.  Agree that it could use a little less fish sauce.

Chef John never disappoints! This was so delicious and my whole family loved this recipe, two pans, left the jalapenos and green onions out for the kids, all in for the adults. Because the sauce wasn't reducing, I added a little cornstarch.

Amazing!  Great combination of flavours, goes perfect with rice. Even the picky Japanese in our house love this, it is one of my comfort food recipes. Watch the video, I found it very helpful and understood the recipe much better. Thanks Chef John! Another one of you’re recipes is a hit in our house

I needed to make some changes based on what I had.  I used 1/4 cup of soy because I didn't have fish sauce.  I also didn't have fresh ginger or cilantro, so I used dried for both.  It was amazing!  My whole family loved it.  I made it with rice and "savory baby bok choy from this website.

This is a very versatile Wednesday night recipe when time is short, weather is hot, and you don't want takeout!  It has nice flavor even without the peppers.  I added sautéed sweet onion and baby Bella mushrooms, but carrots work well.  Also suggest a half teaspoon of white pepper.  A definite keeper!  Thanks Chef!

I'm not a picky guy. I love all foods. I made this exactly the way it said to make it and it was horrible. No one that tried it liked it :( extremely fishy not so much caramel. Should be called fishy chicken

Loved the flavor, but couldn't get the sauce to thicken up. Probably something I did on my end.  The store was out of skinless, boneless thighs so I used chicken breasts.  Next time, I would cut down the brown sugar a bit and add the second jalapeno.   Mine were really big, so I only added one.

This is delicious! I made it exactly to the recipe.

My pet peeve on here is when people say they made the recipe, and then add their changes. So no, you didn't make the recipe. You made your version of the recipe. 

That said I will make this again, but I'm going to use only one jalapeno. It's good with two, don't get me wrong but just for my personal taste, one pepper will do.

This was soooooooo good! Before this I hadn't had much luck making this type of dish. This turned out amazing! I could eat it everyday. The sauce is perfect and the jalapeños add a nice heat and flavor. Also I think the fish sauce is a must. Fish sauce can be intimidating but it really completes certain dishes. I did use chicken breasts and it turned out fine. I cut them into large chunks and was careful not to overcook them, so I didn't have a problem with them being dry. I also didn't have any problems getting the sauce to reduce. I served this over white rice with broccoli on the side and it was definitely one of my favorite things I have ever cooked!

I used half of the meat but it came out with pretty complex flavor. I have a folder of things that my wife wants a repeat of and this was one of them.

This was absolutely delicious. I didn't have jalapeno peppers so used dried pepper flakes, otherwise followed directions exactly. I think it is worth watching the video for tips on how to get the chicken to caramelize. I served it with noodles but next time will follow Chef John's suggestion to use rice, it would soak up the sauce better!.

This came out great! As usual, I didn't exactly follow the recipe. I didn't have fish sauce, so I just used rice vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger. Per another reviewer's comment, I didn't add the water. I lazily added all of the sauce to the partially cooked chicken. It took about 20 minutes on high before the sauce started to thicken, but the taste was perfect. Served it with brown rice and veggies. Yum!

This is fantastic.  A restaurant quality dish.  Against my low-carb conscious, I used the brown sugar as prepared as directed.  I like Hot and this was HOT, so beware if using the jalepenos.  I sliced as suggested, but in future I may dice up to more evenly distribute the heat through out the dish.  Make sure to watch the vidieo. The carmelization  process is key.

Very good!  Not hard.  Used only one jalapeño and popped it in with the green onions for a little cooking down the bite.  But I could have used the second one easily and should next time.  Served with stir fried baby bok choy. Good dinner!  Served 4

I made this several times now and there are never leftovers.  I usually double the recipe.  One recommendation...  The reduction of the initial sauce does take exceedingly long.  To avoid overcoming the chicken, remove the chicken after the recommended time and reduce just the sauce.  It will reduce much quicker and Carmelites nicely.  Once reduced, return the chicken to the reduction and proceed as directed.  Chef John's recipe's are always fantastic!

It added great flavor to the chicken.  I'm diabetic though, so I used Splenda instead of regular sugar, and I cut back the amount a bit.  Still good, will make it again.

Really good flavor!  My sauce ended up pretty thin though. It was fine until I added the chicken, then it got liquidy. But we enjoyed it anyway.

This recipe has made it onto to the list of foods everyone in my family will eat.  

I made the recipe exactly as written the first time.  It was still pretty good, but I made a few tweaks to suit our tastes.

I decreased the fish sauce to 1/4 cup.
Omitted the water.
1 tsp of sriracha in place of the jalapeno.

Great and very easy meal. The hardest part, as usual, was cutting up the chicken! Other than that, it was a breeze. I probably added a little too much brown sugar, so I'll reduce that next time. Great dish, enjoyed by all.

This recipe is awesome!  I have picky eaters at my house (unfortunately), but this recipe pleased the whole family. I didn't have peanuts or jalapeños, I used peanut butter and red pepper, also left out the oil. Best of all, it was so easy to make. This will definitely go into the meal rotation. Thanks for a great recipe chef John!!

Tasted Great! Smelled awful making it!!!!!!! I was scared to try it, and my family  was no less scared, and worried about what I was feeding them! The smell permeated the whole house, and lingered after too, which is too bad because it really did taste amazing! So, might need to make this only in summer with the doors wide open, or make it a couple of days ahead a time to let the smell disperse before eating to not feel turned off by it before eating. Would make a great dinner for guests, but don't cook it while their there! I'm assuming the smell was from the fish sauce, but wow!!!

Okay, so the title of this recipe threw me off a bit, but it was intriguing, so I decided to give it a try. I have cooked using small amounts of fish sauce before, and while the smell has always kind of nauseated me, I haven't really been able to taste it in the end result. This was not the case for this recipe. I found the fish sauce to be overwhelming and the sauce to be too sweet and too salty. I followed the directions as written and had even added the water. The chicken itself had great flavor, so it wasn't so bad with less sauce and more rice. We won't be trying this one again (and I will definitely be wary of any recipe that uses more than a small amount of fish sauce!)

This recipe is delicious! Watch Chef John's video first, then follow the recipe closely. Make sure you cook it on High temp. I have a gas stove and never cook on high, I'm scared to do that... but it works wonderfully in this recipe. The only change I made was cleaning the thighs. I couldn't quarter them, family would lose it. I clean everything and clear it of all skin, fat, etc... so the result is a bowl of nothing but thigh meat. This was so good... really a good recipe.

Made exactly as directed.  I wasn't overly thrilled about it but hubby liked it a lot so could have just been an off night for me.  I thought it was a little fish saucy/vinegary for me. But will make it again because thighs are cheap and easy to prepare.

The sauce is amazing! As mentioned in the recipe and video, do not omit the fresh/minced/chopped ginger and fish sauce. I will say that the timing listed was a bit off for me - it took me quite a bit to get that initial liquid to brown. Be sure to use high heat or else you'll be waiting forever. Remember, you can't really overdo chicken thighs because of their fat content. Will definitely make again!

This is amazing!  Based on the other reviews, I took the time to watch the video and made the recipe exactly as written.   It is delicious and comes together quickly.  It can definitely be a midweek meal.  I don't normally like dark meat, but even I liked chicken thighs this way.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was delicious. I enjoyed making it and I love anything with fish sauce in it. It is a bit salty I have to admit but that is easily rectified. I think next time I'll take a 1/4 of the fish sauce out and replace it with water.  Like other members commented on, the first 1/3 cup of the sauce didn't become syrupy until about 10 or so minutes in.  It was very well balanced even tho a tad salty. I'm definitely making this again and I can't wait to try Chef John's other recipes!

Delicious recipe!  I had to substitute more soy sauce and vinegar and added Old Bay seasoning in place of the fish sauce.  Used chicken breast instead of thighs, and I didn't use cilantro for my garnish, just the green onions.  Only advice is to make sure your prepared and watch the sauce once it is all poured into the pan.  I took my eyes off of it while I was getting my kids chicken cut and my sauce reduced way too much, had to make extra after that.

Definitely a keeper.  My family loved this recipe and made it with Chef John's Garlic and Ginger Bok Choy.  Perfect together!   We made only 2 changes.  We added a red bell pepper and omitted the jalapeno.  The bell pepper was great, but the next time we make it we will add the jalapeno.

Vert good.  Made it as called for except did not add water. It still required thickening but was excellent.

no changes made.  User error perhaps
yes I will try again.

the sauce did not do what it was supposed to do. I ended up with a burnt matter of a mess. I had to throw it out..

NOW, given that it did taste pretty good minus the burnt. I will try this again on a lower heat maybe. I have never ever had a problem with a recipe from this cook. So I am seriously thinking user error

One of best chicken dishes ever! I did use red pepper flakes instead of jalapeno - but really that was just a visual difference.
I used garlic paste - per Chef John's video.  I also poured about 1/2 sauce in with chicken and reduced it down till nothing in the pan - it was all caramelized on the chicken and then added the rest. It cooked down very fast after that and fresh green onions on at the very end makes a wonderful statement in flavor.  Don't skimp on them.  I also took advice and kept the pan on high heat.  We served with roasted garlic cauliflower so did not miss the rice at all.  I can't wait to have left overs and will keep these ingredients on hand to make any time.  It will impress your guests!

Made for dinner tonight using 6 boneless/skinless chicken thighs. Per other reviewers suggestions, omitted water, used 1/2  apple cider vinegar and 1/2 rice vinegar(still 1/3 cup total),  reduced brown sugar to 1/2 cup and oil to 2 Tblsp, plus added good pinch of red pepper flakes and half a chopped Vidalia onion as part of the marinade.  Marinated approx. 2 hours in fridge.  Reserved 3/4 of marinade to reduce on stove(adding rest to baking dish), and later spooned on top of roasted chicken.  Due to food allergies, had to omit peanuts and jalapenos but still was DELISH!!   Family loved it....served with cauliflower fried rice(minus the pork) from this site.  So tasty!!

I love this recipe!  I get the jumbo pack of chicken thighs and make them all at once with this recipe so that the leftovers keep me fed for days.  I always forget the cilantro, peanuts, scallions, though they would make the dish even better and are all pretty typical SE Asian garnishes for this type of dish.  I use the Three Crabs brand of fish sauce--it's the best!  Though I have always used the method in the video, next time I will try pulling the chicken when I'm ready to reduce the sauce to see if the chicken comes out a little more tender that way.

Loved the flavour! Was worried when I could only smell fish sauce as it was frying... but it all worked out deliciously! I didn't have jalapeños, green onion, or peanuts. I added a tablespoon or two of red chilli flakes to make up for the missing spice. Awesome recipe! Will have to make again!

Amazing! Be patient with the sauce and as others have pointed out, do not use breast meat. The chicken thighs were tender and juicy after spending quite some time in that boiling sauce waiting for it to reduce.

This was delicious. I did not have green onion so I substituted with green bell pepper other than that I followed the recipe. I see some had problem in reducing the sauce, and this would not be a problem if this was cooked on high heat.  I will make this again !

I loooved this recipe!! My 7-year old son said it was his favorite food.  I didn't have any green or regular onions, cilantro and fresh ginger on hand, instead I used powered ginger. I also used a little extra soy sauce, added a dash of Sriracha sauce, some crushed red pepper and omitted the jalapeños, didn't want it spicy. It was so delicious and so easy to make, I will make this many times again!!

This was amazing! I followed the recipe to  T except for the jalapeno (which I am not a big fan of) instead I used 1/2 tbsp. of chili paste and added it to the brown sugar mixture. Even my super picky niece who lives with me loved it and I will definitely be making it over and over again!

Followed recipe as written - very good!  Not too salty, not too spicy, not too sweet!  But make sure to follow measurements as written, otherwise flavor can become unbalanced very quickly.  After adding the final sauce liquid - I cooked the chicken for toooo long and it got very sticky and gummy!  There was no longer any 'sauce' to use over the rice!  But it was still very good!  Will make again - but will make sure not to simmer toooo long!

Made (almost) exactly as instructed. Omitted garlic because my dad's allergic. :( Also used cashews instead of peanuts because I already had them and figured they're often used in Asian cooking as well.
Was delicious! I served it over white rice as suggested and made a simple side of sesame broccoli and bell peppers to counter the heaps of flavor from the chicken.
Only bummer is that my jalapenos weren't spicy!! Not sure why they were, but I will try dried chili peppers next time.
I also suggest watching the video. 
Might try cutting down the sugar a bit next time and adding in that garlic if dad's not eating! :)

I have, literally, made this at least a dozen times.  Follow the directions and watch the video and make it exactly as stated, at least  the first time.  Normally, I adjust something, but Chef John scores again!!!  My 2, 7, and 9 year old children will all devour it!  Caramelization of the chicken is key.  Make sure the chicken caramelizes before adding the sauce.

Used bone-in, skin-on thighs for more moisture. Browned them first on both sides on high heat, without adding salt, for 8 to 10 minutes  before  cooking the garlic, ginger and bird chilis in the rendered chicken fat over low heat. Added back the chicken and 1/3 of the brown sugar and liquids mixture and cooked 5 min skin side down. Continued recipe as shown.



Substituted 3 Thai bird chilis instead of jalapenos.Amazing!

Really good dish. I found it a little salty and heavy on the fish sauce, so I'll cut a bit the soy and fish sauce next time. I didn't do jalapeños because I'm not a fan but it was still really good may add some red chili next time. I also used a little corn starch because my sauce wasn't reducing. Will make again.

I reduced the sauce first. Added chicken when it started to get syrupy. Finished dish when I added the last of the sauce.

This is a delicious dish.  I did watch the video, as suggested by another member, and found it helpful for cooking a successful dish. Great flavors!  I added a few drops of chili oil and hot seasame oil to my pan for an added kick of spice.

This is really good!!! I only made a few tiny changes: used canned jalapeños, powdered ginger because the tiny grocery store didn't have ginger root, omitted the peanuts, and oyster sauce rather than fish sauce. I served over white rice and some steamed broccoli, at the suggestion of another reviewer. I will make again! The times for how long to cook the sauce and chicken were helpful and mostly right on.

I’ve made this several times in the past year and we love it. It does take some time for the sauce to thicken up so I might reduce the water.

So good. I had a couple of friends over and one of them is quite a snob about her south-east Asian dishes, but she really liked it.  One of those dishes that make you feel good about what you have cooked. The flavor was wonderful. I did put a little less fish sauce then called for. I worried about the saltiness of it. 
Thanks Chef John for making us feel comfortable in the kitchen. You truly inspire!

This was delicious! I only had the bone in skin on thighs, so I took off the skin before cooking.  I followed the recipe exactly and added some sliced peppers and mushrooms to make it a full meal. My husband and I devoured it!  If you're a fan of sauce I would double the recipe so you have extra to serve on your rice and veggies.

This dish is excellent and easy! I cut the chicken up smaller, and served over jasmine rice with a side of steamed broccoli that we all ended up just mixing into the caramel chicken. My picky partner who loves authentic Asian dishes, absolutely loved this. It's in the dinner rotation now. Thank you!

Well the chicken was not caramelized at all and the sauce was not thick, even after 20 minutes on very high heat. Too much fish sauce too.

This definitely had that "wow" factor, and is now in our family cookbook!

I'm not a big fan of chicken thighs, but I always make a recipe exactly the first time as a baseline. I couldn't believe how delicious they were - it's true that they hold moisture better than the breasts would.

I may have poured too much of the liquid into the pan because it seemed to take forever to boil down and caramelize, but eventually it did. The end result was absolutely delicious and this will be in the rotation for sure!

One note: Our daughter-in-law is Vietnamese and she has proven time and again that the quality of the fish sauce matters! We used Viet Huong "Three Crabs" brand from the Asian supermarket - it tends to be just a tad sweeter than other brands. You can use the supermarket fish sauce if you aren't close to an Asian market, but the taste will be slightly different.

I thought this was very good.  Just as good as something you'd get in a restaurant.  I gave it 4 stars mainly because it's just a very rich dish.  Between the chicken thighs and flavorful sauce, it was almost too much.  Definitely need rice or something bland to pair this with.

Unlike the video...the recipe didn't say to simmer when you pour in the rest of the sauce, so our sauce was overcooked. :( It seems like it would be a good dish if it didn't taste burnt. UPDATE: Made twice more and it is good. I don't like fish flavor or I'd give it a 5. My fiance loves it and asked for it a second night in a row.

Excellent!  My picky family ate every bit of it!  Some of my family members are allergic to fish so I omitted the fish sauce (which I know would really kick the taste up a notch) but it still tasted awesome.  My husband wouldn't stop raving how good it was and how it tastes like restaurant quality.  The only thing I would do differently is to reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup...it was a tad too sweet for our taste buds.  I also added carrots, onions, and bell peppers so that the kids will eat their vegetables and they did.  Overall, this recipe is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing this, Chef John.

This was super awesome. I accidentally used Seasoned Rice Vinegar and while I will definitely  get unseasoned for next time it worked out ok (a tad too salty) Also used powdered ginger because I was out of the other and it was still 5 stars- although I can't wait to make it right next time!

Couldn't have asked for an easier recipe tonight. It being Monday and all. Very simple. I added mushrooms and bean sprouts to mine making it a little more on the stir-fry side. I took away some of the peanuts and used only one jalapeño. I was serving it to my 5 year old who loved it! I put mine over a bed of rice. Delicious!!

Excellent!!! I did not have jalapeno's so I used about a tablespoon of Sriracha in the sauce and used cashews instead of peanuts. Quartering the thighs gives this a really nice texture. Thank you!!!!

Excellent Asian dish. Add sesame seeds. Peanuts are a must!

PHenomenal.  Halved the recipe and cut the chicken into small pieces, not quarters-- but otherwise followed it exactly.  I practically licked my plate.  I read other reviews that said it was too salty or fishy and am glad I disregarded them because I didn't find it to be off in any way.  I could have it again tomorrow.

Followed the recipe and thought it was just OK. My only omission was the jalapenos because I don't like them, so I don't think it would have improved the recipe (for me). I was expecting this dish to be more sweet, but it was very very salty and definitely fishy.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauce did reduce as expected, but for me, this just wasn't a 'WOW' recipe.

This is sinfully good. I could eat the entire batch by myself. I change nothing, and I follow the directions. Mostly. The only thing that is different for me is the time it takes to get the chicken and 1/3 cup sauce to brown. It usually takes me more time, about ten minutes. It's totally worth the time, though, just keep it on high heat until it browns - it'll get there!

This recipe is a love/hate relationship.  First off and most important, watch the video!!  There are valube tips on the technique of making this dish.  I cooked this on high the ENTIRE time and did not burn it.  Don't be afraid to use high like the recipe calls for.  As long as your flipping or stirring frequently, you are not going to burn it.  Also, the cooking time is off on the recipe, at least for me it was.  Took twice as long to reduce and caramelize, about 15-20 minutes.  The flavor of the dish is like teriyaki.  I personally didn't think it was too sweet, like other reviewers mentioned.

However, I too agree that this dish is too salty, hence the missing stars.  It was almost too salty for me to eat the first night I made it.  Others in my family did not think so, though.  The leftovers on the other hand were just fine.  The saltiness diminished overnight in the fridge.  I might have to find a different fish sauce to use or adjust the recipe to my taste.

Overall, though, I will be making this dish over and over again because my family and I loved it.  Best recipe I've found on Allrecipes in a long time.

I just made this tonight and it's good and easy. I think next time I will add more than 1/3 cup to thicken. This sauce really keeps the chicken moist. I will definitely make it again soon

OMG! This recipe was fantastic.  For some reason, my sauce didn't carmalize (maybe because I accidently used light brown sugar, it was definitely cook error), but it still came out amazing.  It was like a restaurant meal!

Wow! I wasn't sure what to expect, but before adding the jalapenos/onions/peanuts, it tasted exactly like chicken teriyaki from those Japanese places at the mall!

Very delicious, but slightly too sweet for me.  Next time I will cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. I used Kirkland frozen chicken breast tenders and they came out great, not dry at all. The only other substitute was using 1 Tablespoon of Sriracha instead of the Jalapeños (which I didn't have on hand). At the end I threw in some steamed matchstick sliced carrots and snow peas and then served over jasmine rice. Thank you for a great recipe!

Turns out delicious. Don't be scared to use high heat to reduce the sauce initially otherwise it will take forever to caramelize it.I started out at medium and it took about 12 minutes to reduce even after turning it up to high after a few minutes.

This was incredibly salty, thanks to the fish sauce. Unfortunately, it was the only flavor. I hesitate to recommend this recipe, unless there is a way to remedy it.

Amazing flavors! Super fast! Super easy! BUT PLEASE DO NOT ADD THE 1/3 CUP WATER!!!!!! The chicken will be dry and rubbery by the time the sauce reduces.  Ruined an otherwise great recipe.

I scaled this WAY down because I had just a few leftover thighs from a value-pak and wanted to try something new. Very tasty...I liked the way the sauce carmelized at the end. The addition of peanuts and scallions really makes it. I like a little more sauce, so the next time I would double or triple it. Thanks for the recipe!

So good! The husband loved it so much the first time I made it that he's asked me to make it three times since. The first time I made this, my only variations were to use light brown sugar instead of dark, and I doubled the soy sauce in lieu of the fish sauce because I didn't have any. The second and third times I made it, I did the same thing as the first but used chicken breast tenderloins and cut down cooking time. Not nearly as good, but still delicious. The fourth time, I forgot the jalapeño at the store so I used a pinch of cayenne pepper. Equally great!

Fantastic! A treat meal for sure based on the sugar and salt included but really delicious so it's worth it! I skipped the water based on other suggestions and served it with sushi rice. I don't think the name caramel chicken gives a real indication of what this recipe makes, I liken it to the teriyaki chicken available at bento bowl shops.

This is great, not surprising since Chef John's recipes usually are.  I made substitutions based on what I had-oyster sauce, apple cider vinegar, and added some mushrooms and assorted bell peppers.  Also left out jalapenos and peanuts because my 9 month old was dining with us.  Thanks for sharing!

My 6 year old said " mommy, this is the best thing you've ever made". My husband's eyebrows raised in delight with his first bite. My 4 year old, after tasting it, didn't complain as loudly as usual about eating his dinner. So this will be a do-over for sure. Although with 3/4 a cup of sugar, probably not as often as my family would like.

This recipe is AMAZING!   I just can't leave it alone once it is made.   This is now our go-to recipe for when we have company over.  

Note - to get the full flavor out of this, you really need to boil down the liquid ("reduce").  The max flavor comes when the chicken is just starting to burn a little...

Chef John - thank you!

Excellent recipe, came out as good or better than anything I have ever ordered at PF Changs.  To those of you you having issues reducing the liquid (or who find there is too much water) note that most chicken in grocery stores is or was frozen at some point.  I find meats that were frozen tend to "shed" more moisture when you cook them.  I left the water out of this recipe as others have but noticed when cooking my chicken that there was a lot of moisture that had escaped (easily 1/3 cup in the bottom of the pan).  I also found it easier to just reduce the sauce in a separate sauce pan (so not to overcook the chicken).  So I think next time I will just brown the chicken in one pan and then reduce the sauce in another and pour it over the chicken to simmer.  Note (probably like some of you) I have temperature controlled glass top burners on my oven which make it difficult to get that quick/high heat you need to reduce things.  I imagine folks with gas burners have no problem reducing the sauce.  Excellent recipe - it will be over a thousand 4.5-5 star ratings in no time!

This was very good at the time that you make it.  Do not plan on leftovers.  It loses it's yumminess the next day.  Probably because I put it away with the rice.  Definitely watch the video and then make it.  Soooo yummy!

This was way too salty for my family's liking.  The flavor has potential, but the saltiness is too overpowering.  Not sure if I want to try to modify and make again.

Really great!!!  Followed the recipe and watched the video which was very helpful.  The only changes I made were.....made more sauce because  I steamed red/green pepper and broccoli in separate pot and added to the mix at the end. Didn't use jalapeno but sprinkled in red pepper flakes for a little heat.  Served over basmati rice.  I think the next time I will add a little corn starch to the remaining sauce so it thickens a bit more.  Great recipe!!!

We enjoyed this but I did feel the fish sauce was a little overwhelming in taste & smell so I'll reduce it next time. I only added jalapenos to half cuz some of us are spice wimps. Good stuff!

I followed the directions exactly but my chicken was a soupy mess after 10 minutes. I drained all of that off and just put a little more sauce in to caramelize. That worked and then I put the rest of the sauce in. My family liked it but I thought the flavor was off - just no wow factor and it had a weird flavor. Maybe it was the fish sauce?

I used chicken legs since they were on sale, and the sauce did take longer to reduce, but the prolonged time just meant the chicken could really absorb that wonderful flavor.  I may decrease the water next time as mentioned by someone else.  I did omit the peanuts only because I didn't have any on hand. Very good recipe.

I followed this recipe but had to be a little creative. I used thin cut boneless skinless chicken (Trader Joes) and instead of actual chilies I used siracha. I also had to add vegetables (asian stir fry mix from Trader Joes). I found that for the thin cut boneless skinless chicken 2 pieces suffice but with vegetables in the mix change the quantity to 3. It turned out amazing! I am a college student so this worked perfectly since it became 3-4 meals for me!

Good flavor, but it was TOO spicy.  Next time I'll cut back on the jalapenos some.  This was similar to Pei Wei's dish, but it could use some tweaking.  Try it once at least, you won't be disappointed.

Followed the sauce exactly and my daughter thought it had a nice balance of sweet and salty.  Whoa, a kid telling me that? lol.  I thought otherwise.  It's a bit on the salty side.  The pungent jalapeños is a must in this dish.  Seed it out if you don't want it spicy.

I used 3 large chicken breasts cut in small chunks instead of the thighs.  This was pretty good, if a bit on the salty side. Tasted like something you would get at a chinese restaurant. Served over brown rice and everyone ate it up!

We've made this 2 times this week! It is very easy & forgiving. Made a couple of changes, no jalapeño (have a 4 year old), and used Bragg's in leu of fish sauce (didn't have any)  omitted additional soy sauce. First time stuck other wise quite strictly (used chicken tenderloins, oops, bought wrong chicken) and was a huge hit! A-fore mentioned 4-year-old LOVED it (very picky with meat)!  So tonight had extra pork chop, so... Didn't measure except brown sugar, and used left over red onion instead of green onion, and extra garlic & fresh ginger& it came together quickly with little fuss! A definite favorite at our house, maybe we'll get brave and get some jalapeños too.

This recipe is wonderful. I didn't have any rice vinegar, so used white wine vinegar instead, but other than that, followed the recipe faithfully. The chicken was sweet, but you could taste all the individual ingredients and the peanuts added another texture to  the dish. I shall be making this again. Thanks

This was fabulous.  I made very minor changes - increased soy sauce to equal fish sauce - used seeded Serrano peppers rather than jalapeno (personal preference) - skipped cilantro and substituted with uncooked sliced scallions - addition - boiled broccoli for 2 - 3 minutes, drained and mixed in the sauce last minute or so.  I also tried different nuts - cashews were good and toasted pecans were wonderful.  Finally I did use cubes of chicken breast one time - I preferred that but hubby preferred the thighs.  I always say I hate people that change the recipe and then rate based on changes but I feel my changes were minor and the "spirit of the recipe" was not changed.  This has become one of our favorite meals.

This dish caused cravings!  Sooooo good! More work than I anticipated, but I think that is because I had to make my own fish sauce as I couldn't find it in the store. Plus I think I put too much of the brown sugar mixture in at first, causing me to spend extra time reducing it. I will cook this many times over. Lovely recipe popping with flavor! A winner; certainly good enough for guests!!!

AMAZING! My entire family loved this meal. I was quite simply stunned that something so delicious came out of my kitchen! The only change I made was to skip the jalepenos because I didn't think my children would like them.

Husband was not too fond of it but I loved it! Perhaps if I cut down on the sugar, use fish sauce which I could not find here in the Caribbean and add some vegetables husband may change his mind.  Will definitely try again.

My family loved this recipe and I will be making it again. I used Jasmine rice, as suggested by another rater, and the taste was wonderful. 
It was very sweet, however, so next time I may add less brown sugar. 
My mother asked for the recipe as it is, so she also loved it!
Overall just a great dish to do again!

I made this the other day, and it was absolutely delicious!!! I didn't have some of the ingredients, so I had to improvise.  I did not have fish oil so I added more soy sauce. I did not have jalapenos or green onion, so left that out.  To add spice I added a TBS of korean hot paste.  My husband said I can make this dish anytime I want to =) ( I did serve over korean white rice ).

I bought some chicken thighs from the store and didn't know what to do with them.  I searched and found this recipe.  I changed it a bit since I didn't have fish sauce.  I added a bit more ginger and some Worcestershire Sauce.  I also added a little more water to compensate for the difference in liquid.  Right before I added the jalapeno mixture, I turned the heat up like i wanted to glaze the meat.  this helped to reduce the liquid.  This recipe was wonderful.  Everyone cleared their plates and I can't wait to make it again.

I followed this almost to a T.  The only change I made was reducing the water to 1/4 cup.  Also garnished with the greens from the green onions.  One trick when making this, don't necessarily adhere to the approx cook times to get the sauce to the syrup stage.  It depends on your pan and the heat of your stove on high.  I used a heavy skillet, took 15 mins. First stage and 10 minutes 2nd stage.  I will definitely make this again"

I made this last night for dinner. Its full of flavor, contrasting flavors. You get some sweet, some salty, some heat from the peppers. Nice contrast of textures as well with the peanuts giving a nice crunch. Great recipe for us home cooks who try to channel Chefs like John! thanks .

This recipe was awesome.  I did not change a thing. I have made so many recipes from this wonderful site but this is the only one I felt I had to comment on.  The one thing that was off for me was the cooking time to get the chicken carmelized.  Took me about 10 minutes or so.  Can't wait to make again.

AMAZING! I did a few changes, I did 2 parts soy/1 part lemon juice for the fish sauce, only half the amount of ginger, and added some corn starch to help thicken the sauce. Next time Im just going to skip the water instead of adding corn starch

I really wanted to love this recipe but I just couldn't.  It was so sweet I could hardly eat it and my hubby hated it.  I had to thicken the sauce with cornstarch because it wouldn't thicken on its own. I'm gonna use this as a base recipe and make my own adjustments.  First Chef John recipe to disappoint.

This was amazing!!!  I wanted to rate it 10 stars!  I followed the recipe exactly (after watching the video) and served it over brown rice.  My husband and I forced ourselves to stop eating it, so that we would have leftovers.  This is my new favorite chicken dish!

Very yummy and the whole family (with the exception of the 1-year-old, but who can count that?) really enjoyed.  A bit sweet for us, next time would definitely add less sugar.  This was not a labor-intensive dish, but I made it so.  We are extremely picky about our meat, no fat, no veins, etc.  And chicken thighs make for a LOT of trimming.  To make it slightly easier, I cooked the thighs in the oil first, then removed them, trimmed and chopped, and put back in the skillet.  All the while I had the sauce boiling down in a sauce pan (FORGOT the no water tip, argh!).  When I was done with the trimming, I added the sauce into the skillet with the trimmed chicken and boiled it all down for about 10 minutes.  Doubtless if I'd not added the water this would have been caramel-y and gooey, as it was it was just saucy, but very tasty.  In the future, since I did not really cook the chicken and the sauce together, I would go back to our standard chicken breasts, cooked quickly and the separately boiled sauce thrown in last.  Thighs are just too much work in this house!

This had good flavor, but the chicken breast pieces got way overcooked while waiting for the sauce to reduce/caramelize. My fault for not reading the reviews first! Next time I will use the chicken thighs or make the sauce separately from the chicken.

My wife generally doesn't like anything sweet in foods other than desserts so I made this last night with a bit of trepidation.  But sure enough she loved it and so did I.  I think it's the balance between sweet & salty that made it so good.  Thanks again Chef John!

Really good.  I used a wok, counter to popular belief that it wouldn't carmelize quickly.

I've made this twice.  Both times it was delicious - first time my husband thought it was a little salty so the second time I cut back on the fish sauce a little bit and that seemed to make it perfect for him.

WOW. Made this on a whim using what we had on hand- bone-in thighs and no cilantro or green onions, which I am really looking forward to trying next time. We also had to do without the jalapenos as my two sons are totally heat-phobic... it was still SO good! I can't wait to make this again for the grownups, the right way, and maybe with some red thai chile simmering in the sauce as well!

Loved this dish - very easy and you get restaurant quality asian food in very little time. I only had a 10" sauté pan to work with and so it took about 25 minutes to reduce the initial bit of sauce, but as Chef John points out the chicken thighs are fine with that - I was simply patient and waited for some nice caramelization. My dinner guests just kept saying "Mmmm" with every bite. What more can a cook ask for?

Easy to cook, excellent flavor, wonderful texture for the sauce.  It was my first time working with fish sauce so I was not prepared for the aroma that boiled off.   Next time I'll skip the fish sauce and add more soy sauce instead.

This was amazing! I followed the recipe as stated, except I omitted the water and used chicken breasts instead of thighs. Admittedly, the meat was a little dry, but the sauce more than made up for it.  I thought the sauce had just the right amount of spice and sweetness for my taste. Will make again for sure!

My family will not eat spicy food so I had to leave out the jalapeño but it was still delicious.  Will definitely make this again.

super yummy and easy! Did not have fish sauce, used oyster sauce instead. Also used bone in chicken thighs just browned them first and adjusted the cooking time. Will be making again!!!!

Apart from buying the ingredients, this was a fairly quick and easy meal. And very tasty! It went well with peas and basmati rice.
Unfortunately I couldnt get the sauce to reduce at all, in spite of following the recipe. I'll probably try it again without the water, as other reviewers have suggested.
Even so, for an unusual and hassle-free meal, five stars.

Since I do not know how to edit or delete my previous review so I am writing it again. On the review some had a trouble reducing the sauce so I think I reduced the sauce too much. I was in a haste and did not watch a video. But after watching pics and videos, I noticed that I made mistakes! I would try it again but my kids probably are not thrilled of me attempting this again...

This is a great dish!  Tasty and easy to prepare.  Do have all ingredients ready to add before you start, however, as things go pretty quickly.  (I had no trouble getting the sauce to caramelize as did golfprochriss.)  If you plan on a side vegetable, get that going, too, so you won't have to hold the chicken; sauce will continue to thicken, and you'll want every drop snuggling in with your jasmine rice. Make this tonight!

Yes, this is a quick and flavorful recipe.  I put it on top of some steamed rice with some steamed broccoli and it was great.  The sauce is pretty powerful.  One thing I noticed was when adding the first third of sauce to coat the chicken it seemed watered down and took a long time to cook down to a thicker sauce.  Next time I will try draining the broth from the chicken after cooking it a bit and see if that helps.. Or adding less sauce at first.  Great recipe and I'm going to make it again tonight.

Wow!  This is an AWESOME chicken recipe!  I followed this one exactly.  Next time I would definitely use low sodium soy sauce.  I didn't realize how salty fish sauce is, so that's my only minor complaint.  Also, it took at least half an hour of cooking the chicken and the sauce on med-high heat to get it properly caramelized, not 6-7 minutes.  This is probably due to the fact that I have an electric stove.  I'm sure it would caramelized faster if you have gas.
Definitely restaurant quality and I'm looking forward to making some other recipes by Chef John

i LOVED this dish!  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it didn't turn out as expected.  From the description, I was expecting a glaze-y type sauce, something like the sauce on General Tso's or sesame chicken.  It didn't happen that way for me.  Instead, I had a pretty thin sauce, so I mixed equal parts corn starch and water and added it to the dish before I mixed in the peanuts and jalepenos.  It was still REALLY good!  Not sure what I did wrong the first time, but I will definitely make this again anyway!

Absolutely delicious!  I made it as written except I skipped the cilantro and I used only one jalapeno because I thought two would be too spicy.  Next time I will use two.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was WONDERFUL!!! The combination was amazing.  I substituted soy sauce and worchestershire for fish sauce.  My boyfriend said it was the best chicken and rice dish he's ever had...even at Pei Wei!

This was very good. Next time, I think I'll leave the water out as I needed to add cornstarch to thicken it up. Without the water, I think it would have been just right.

Excellent dish. Made this tonight and the family loved it. I will definitely make this again. I also had to use corn starch to thicken the sauce, otherwise it was very very good.

This turned out FABULOUS and I didn't have the fish sauce or ginger. I used red wine vinegar and worchester sauce instead. I used bone in thighs so i cooked it for close to 30 minutes. The kids even ate it!

This dish is amazing. The flavors work perfectly together. I will be making this again and again. I did not use or substitute for the fish sauce due to allergies but the recipe still shone.

This was delicious!  I didn't have green onions & left out the peanuts but kept everything else the same.  I used jalapenos from the jar and served over rice.  I might add some broccoli next time to get my veggies in.  This was quick & easy to put together.  It's going in my top recipes.
