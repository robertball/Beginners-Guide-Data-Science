Well, I would give this recipe a 3 as it is written.  I followed the directions exactly and when I asked my guest what they thought they all said, “Well, it tastes like watermelon.”  Not really what I was looking for, but I had to agree with them.  I was willing to drink it, but I didn’t want seconds.  Then I tried adding 7 Up, a suggestion that someone else made and I had to give it a big wonderful 5!  The 7 Up made the difference!  With that help, I couldn’t get enough!  YUM!

I like this a lot! Although I had to sweeten it a lot more for my tastes. I used about tablespoon of honey and two to three tablespoons sugar.

Well done tho.

Instead of using ice cubes, I blended in frozen strawberries with the watermelon.  Didn't add any honey or sweetener, but did add a small amount of 7Up.  Delish!

Good idea for turning extra watermelon into a cool summer's drink. 
 
I added ginger ale and 1 tsp of sugar to give it a little kick.

I used sugar instead of honey and put them in the freezer right for forty-five minutes before serving and they were great. Made me wish that the evening had been much hotter, they were so refreshing.

I took Sheila's advice and used frozen strawberries instead of the ice. What a fabulous idea! It worked so nicely and it was absolutely delish. Very refreshing and appreciated after a hard work out. Thank you "Ilovscream!"

Served this yesterday for neighborhood BBQ. I followed suggetions of others as far as using some 7-up. I also added a few pinches of suger rather than a full cup. I left some larger pieces of ise in tact since it was 102 degrees in Vegas Yesterday. Came out beautifully. Few adults were able to get a taste 'cause the kids just went nutzo over it! Thanks

I love watermelon but not water it down, so, I didn't put too much ice in mine. I tried the Freska in mine and loved it. I didn't use the honey, watermelon was already sweet. Might try what another viewer tried...Tequilla!

My son was requesting some type of drink with the watermelon I bought. I decided on this one. Not quite sure how to fairly rate this...it turned out pretty well, but I didn't really measure...just added to the blender as it buzzed along. Maybe added too much honey, it was very dominate. Added some sugar, too. Everyone drank it except the son who requested it because of the honey taste. Maybe I'll try some lemon-lime soda next time.

Nice idea for left over watermelon! I added some lemonade, nice refreshing treat. You could also freeze this into ice cubes for other summer drinks or popcicles for the kids.

To cool down and stick with a diet this is your drink. Except, I used a juicer to juice the watermelon. My blender is a really old 1996 version.

Delish! Had a watermelon in the fridge uncut for a few weeks, cut it open today but it wasnt as crisp as I like....so, off I went in search of a slushy recipe.   This one is simple and delicious. I prefer honey to sugar in almost all cases so no argument there, and I didnt even measure the ice and watermelon I just dumped it all in the blender =)  Its hot here today and this is super! Thanks for this simple and great recipe. Next time I might try with 7-up because that sounds interesting but this was really good ^^

Yummy - and a great way to use up watermelon that's a little over-ripe.  I omitted the honey and it was sweet enough on it's own.  My kids loved it!

This is super delicious! My son and I love watermelon. I thought I would try it with a ripe melon that needed used quickly. The honey adds a subtle sweetness and brings out the melon flavor.  Plus, I felt good giving it to my son, so nutritious.

Nice recipe but no way do these quantities make four servings! This managed about 1/2 pint - enough for one person.

I would make this again if I had extra watermelon.  I used 7-up this time but I think I might prefer the honey.

I had a watermelon that really wasn't sweet enough for eating. I hated to just throw it away, so I decided to try a drink with it. This works! I used Splenda instead of the honey because I am on Weight Watchers and this counts as 0 PointsPlus for me to have a cool, refreshing drink.

My mom makes a modified version. She adds rose syrup instead of honey and that gives it a nice kick that's popular with our guests! Add enough so it doesn't get diluted from the ice.

What a great way to use up the leftover watermelon from this weekend's bbq!  Made as directed, topped with a little whipped cream and served with a straw.  A big hit with and without the frozen strawberries.

Interesting recipe, although, it did taste a bit like plain crushed watermelons. If you add a bit of sugar, it helps. Also, we added minced mint leaves which was great but adding that reminded us too much of "chilled watermelon soup".

After reading other reviews, I made a change or two and LOVED the result. I added 1 cup Sugar Free Strawberry Lemonade that was sitting in the fridge, and plopped in 4-5 frozen strawberries. I didn't add but a few ice cubes because I really don't like thick beverages, so this is more like a pulpy punch.  This is a good recipe for leftover watermelon that is sitting in the fridge!!

Wasn't too fond of the texture at first so I blended it again with 1/2 Cup of StrawberryBanana Crystal Light and it came out quite tasty!

I made but froze some watermelon chunks & used instead of ice or strawberries. I made adult & kid versions adding vodka for adults & plain for kids. Big hit! I added the lime juice also & used sugar not honey. Very good & so simple. Gosh you could do it with any fruit. My next experiment will be with honeydew. Woohoo!

Instead of the written 6 ice cubes, I put 10 but didn't crush it thoroughly , and then added an additional couple (not crushed) ice cubes after it was finished. Also, instead of honey, I used 1/2 tsp of sugar. After the changes, it tasted like what I'd call ACTUAL slushy, not watered down watermelon juice.

I had some frozen watermelon chunks to use up. I made it as written except I used the frozen watermelon instead of ice cubes. It was SO good! I do want to try it with some Sprite, though. It felt like a treat, but is low calorie! Thank you!

Its a little flavorless so I added sugar,lemon juice and whipped cream but very refreshing.
