I used everything it called for but added 2 extra Tablespoons of brown sugar and topped with shredded cheddar cheese. I cooked it 20 minutes and stirred the mixture and topped with more cheese. Returned to the oven and baked another 25 minutes. It turned out wonderful!!!

I didn't use the brown sugar or salt but it tasted wonderful!  Our tomatoes are not turning red this year but they look lovely so this was the perfect recipe for them.  Thanks!

Way too salty. Might be better with no salt added, less soy sauce, and served with rice or noodles.

As always, I never rate a recipe unless I make it as written, at least the first time. Made this exactly as written. This one has me stumped. The recipe doesn't call for cheese, but there's cheese in the picture. Baked it in a 2 quart casserole as instructed. Celery wasn't done. That said, even with crunchy celery it had a wonderful and very unique flavor. Instead of casserole, it totally looked like soup. Green tomato soup! Even so, flavor was awesome. In an effort to try to make it into a "casserole " I added some pasta and cooked it in a pan on top of the stove. Pasta absorbed most of the excess liquid and the celery softened up too. I'd for sure make this again. There's NO WAY to describe the blend of flavors. I'm just perplexed HOW to serve it. Is it a side dish, a soup, what! With addition of pasta it did make a side dish. It's VERY unique and very good! I'll  make it again.

I thought this was a really interesting recipe.  I've never had green tomatoes before.  I added green peppers and substituted regular onion for  the green onions in it. Didn't add the salt since the soy sauce is salty enough as it is.  

I think if I make this again, I might add some mushrooms to it and maybe serve it over rice.

Followed Crystal B's version, but added shredded mozzarella and pecorino romano and needed to cook longer. Used low sodium soy and omitted the salt. Great tasting!!

This recipe was another good way to use my green tomatoes.  For the amount of green tomatoes I had, I decided to use 1/2 the soy sauce mixture, and it came out just right - not too juicy as many reviewers commented.  Half way through the baking time, I sprinkled with ~1/2 c shredded cheddar cheese  and ~1/2 cup panko breading  This gave a nice, crunchy topping. I didn't have celery or green onions, so substituted green pepper and yellow onion.  I think any mix of mild flavored vegetables would work well for this recipe.

Excellent tangy flavor, without being too spicy. We added a cup of shredded mexican blend cheese on top which made it extra special. Will definitely save this for next Fall when we are overloaded with green tomatoes due to frost/freeze.

This was tasty but really soupy and not anything like a casserole. (All the liquid comes out of the tomatoes.) I loaded it w/ cheese as well, but it didn't melt well, I'm assuming from all the acid in the tomatoes. (Left out the cilantro; I hate how slimy it gets when cooked and it seemed as if it would overpower the other tasty ingredients.) I also threw in some large cherry toms for a bit of  color.

That said, I wounded up using it as a base for the Green Tomato & Bacon Soup on this site, and for THAT it was fantastic! Made for a super-tasty, chunky stew that we are crazy about!

I combined this with recipe for tempeh bake. Used alot more green tomatos, fresh parsley instead of cilantro,  used sherry wine vinegar instead of apple cider, instead of green onions I  added mushrooms, shallots, green peppers, garlic, and used cayenne instead of pepper flakes.  Came out GREAT!!

Great versatile recipe.  Good to add veggies that you need to good sooner than later.  I had it over rice, I love pasta, so that is next.  .... next time I think I might try thickening the sauce with cornstarch.  Thanks for the recipe and thinking out of the box!!!

Great side dish for pork or chicken.  Followed the other ratings and added less salt, more brown sugar and cheese.  It needed more cooking time to make the green tomatoes less crunchy.  Also great the next day.  Turned sceptics into believers.

I'm another person who joined to rate a good recipe. I made this with white onion since I had no green. I  left out the cilantro, which I don't care for, and the salt since it calls for soy sauce. I am leary of using red pepper flakes lest it be too spicey but it was delicious.

Might be better with half the bread crumbs (or less).  The crumbs overwhelmed the taste of the tomatoes and cheese.
