This was pretty good. I made it into a pie and used a graham cracker crust. It definately needs to be slightly frozen though. Not quite as good when it thaws out and becomes soft.

I also made this into a pie using a purchased chocolate graham pie crust. My family loved it. There were no leftovers. I froze for about 3 hours and then moved it to the refrigerator about 45 minutes before cutting into it. Got a lot of compliments on it and felt a little sheepish about that considering just how easy this is. I omitted the strawberry jam.
