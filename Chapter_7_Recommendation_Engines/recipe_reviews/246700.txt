Very tasty beans. The ham flavor really sets this apart from other recipes. I had already soaked my beans overnight, and, even though I doubled the recipe, I still used my pressure cooker for 15 minutes. The beans were cooked just right, not overcooked-meaning they were soft enough to eat, but intact and held up to the saut√©ing at the end. I drained the liquid before adding the oil and garlic, but reserved it for future recipes. I ended up freezing the leftovers as these would be good as a side on their own or even as an addition to other recipes. Thank you for sharing this with us.
