Kudos to Amanda! This is a beautifully tasty salad. My entire family, from the youngest grandchild to the most senior, loved this salad. The only thing I did was add about 1/4 - 1/3 cup (loosely packed) fresh chopped cilantro and there wasn't even a teaspoonful of this salad left. Thanks, Mom, for submitting this recipe.
P.S. I wish I had snapped a photo, because it was also visually beautiful. (I also used red quinoa.)

I liked it but made some of the substitutions suggested. I used almonds instead of sunflower seeds. For this reason I think it lacks the saltiness needed. Next time I will add salted nuts or cook the quinoa in chicken broth. Either one will add the needed salt in my opinion. I liked this recipe and I will make it again.

Could use a little more dressing flavor. Try adding more vinegar or dressing next time.
