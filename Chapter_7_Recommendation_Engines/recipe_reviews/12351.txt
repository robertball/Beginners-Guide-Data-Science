Absolutely delicious.  I used chocolate ice cream.  To avoid deep frying, bake tortillas coated with spray oil in a soup bowl for 12 minutes at 375 F.

Delicious Crowd Pleaser for the finale to a Mexican Meal.  I tried it with apples and it was fantastic.

Wow! I was really impressed with this recipe.  It was very challenging but it was worth it. The only thing missing was a little whipped cream at the end and it was fantastic!  I recommend this to anyone who is a crowd pleaser.

This is a DELICIOUS recipe! I didn't expect it to be this good, but it turned out awesome! My husband loved it too, even though he is not a dessert lover. The only change I made was that I used apples instead of pears, and I sprinkled the tortillas with cinnamon sugar before adding the apples. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

I opted to bake instead of fry the tortillas. Basted with butter then sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, only did the outside, will do both sides next time.  I was inattentive and that, along  with my my moodily hot oven, resulted in shells that got a bit dark and overdone but this was still a nice and different treat.  I used chocolate ice cream, scooped, rolled in the nut mix, then put them back in the freezer till ready to serve. The little bit of that mix leftover got dumped on top. Drizzled with a bit of Hershey's  Special Dark syrup because I wanted something chocolate with it but was too lazy to make the ganache I really wanted.

This dessert was very good! My only issue was keeping the ice cream from melting as I rolled it in the nuts.

I made only Pear part and it was heavenly good! We ate it with pecan ice cream... Used the pears from our pear tree :)
UPDATE: 
Made it again with store bought pears and it wasn't the same :( The pears weren't soft, I think that's the problem.

Too sweet and tortillas got tough.  OK served with shortbread cookies.   Probably not worth making again.

Amazing. I was confused where to put the honey so I just put a few squirts in with the pears and then in the shells like it suggests. The bowl was a challenge but we figured it out  using a one cup measuring cup, two chip clips and some tongs was worth the struggle.

Whipped cream on top really finishes it off.

The pears came out really amazing and the idea was great, however the tortillas didn't work for me.  I gave up and ended up serving the ice cream in a regular bowl.  But amazing taste with all the rest of the ingredients.  Will make again.
