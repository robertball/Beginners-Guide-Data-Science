This is a keeper!  One of the best recipes I have made in a long, long time.  Perfect as is - no changes are needed at all.  Make sure your scallops are really dry - season them well and into a screaming hot pan.  Don't move them until you flip them.  You want to get them good and crispy on the outside.  So delicious!  Try them - you won't regret making this recipe!  Enjoy!

This is a great recipe....but i experimented with the vinegar. I did one sauce with the rice vinegar per rec. I did another sauce with Trader Joe's Orange muscat champagne vinegar. The Orange muscat vinegar won hands down. Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe Chef John!!! I added 1 clove of garlic, red onion about a tsp., a shake of dried basil, black pepper and a tsp. of agave sweetener.  The direction for cooking them was perfect.  I used unsalted butter and olive oil in the pan.  This vinaigrette would also be good on a salad.  This is why I love Allrecipes, you get so many wonderful ideas.

This was AMAZING! I prepared this for our 31st wedding anniversary dinner tonight for the two of us. I used Bab's (below) additions and substituted a Tangerine flavored balsamic vinegar for the rice one and  1 oz. of jar jalapenos drained, to save time on a fresh one. I served the seared fresh scallops with chilled sliced avocado wedges and orange sections with the dressing drizzled over generously. On the side , baked asagio cheese asparagus and tomatoes, with soft warm garlic bread to soak up the remaining vinaigrette! Hubby gave me a 5 STAR rating! It was well worth the high cost for fresh dry scallops!

Following the recipe exactly provided us with a delightful dinner!  The vinaigrette was a delicious companion to the delicate scallops and oranges.  This recipe perfectly illustrates why John is a chef and I am a cook:  I simply carried out what the chef designed.  I would never have thought of this combination of flavors, but I am certainly glad he did!

I don't review enough of the recipes I steal. This one knocked my socks off.  Tweaked just a bit (2 cloves of garlic and double the dijon, but the rest was as written).  It is subtle and wonderful.  My wife and I decided the perfect sides would be a nice alfredo pasta and some green beans with pine nuts and a bit of lemon zest.  Restaurant quality.

I am so excited about the outcome of this recipe. Fantastic. The flavors explode in your mouth. I live on the shore so I was lucky enough to get scallops fresh off the boat! Make sure you dry your scallops before seasoning. Also don't season ahead of time as the scallops will dry out. Season right before the scallops hit the hot pan. I did strain the vinaigrette. Excellent! Thank You Chef John

Delicious!  The vinaigrette was nice and light and allowed the flavor of the sea scallops to shine (even my grocery store frozen dry sea scallops...all that was available in landlocked-middleofnowhere-PA).  The only change I made was to sub yellow mustard for dijon per personal preference.  Mr. LTH is a bit of sissypants when it comes to heat, so I was concerned w/the jalap vinaigrette and cayenne, but neither really added any significant heat (in fact, next time, I think I'll keep a bit of the membrane and/or seeds from the jalaps for a bit more heat).  I'd never pan seared scallops before and, per usual, Chef John's directions were succinct and spot on.  THANK YOU for an awesome recipe, Chef John!

This was awesome.  I did not change a single thing and it is a 5 star recipe as is.  Truly took less than 20 minutes from start (prep) to finish (eating).  I included sliced avocado with the oranges as per a previous review and it was delicious!!!!  Thank you Chef John.

I made this using jumbo shrimp and it was delicious. I took the advice of the too vinegar tasting folks and used some orange juice with the rice vinegar. and used 1.5 jalapeños and a tomatillo. My husband and I decided to keep this recipe.

I thought this was great.  The only changes I would make is using 2 Jalapeno peppers and less rice vinegar.

Family loved it. Used this an inspiration for scallops & pasta.I used a 5T less than 1/4 c rice vinegar but added 5T lime juice to make 1/4c. Added 1 more fresh jalapeno & minced garlic.  Then breaded the scallops w/Italian bread crumbs, garlic powder, pepper, salt & parmesean cheese. Breaded & sauteed in pan w/ EVOO & butter 2-3min/side.  Meanwhile cooked my pasta-set aside.  In pan added this vinaigrette recipe to jar of Alfredo sauce; added garlic, basil, parsley, oregano, parmesean cheese & a little milk to mix.  Added pasta & still a little tart.  As scallops cooked added to pasta & added scallop pan scrapings to pasta (oil/bread crumbs cut the tartness).  We like spice so a dash of red pepper flakes to kick it up. Served w/garlic bread & salad. Good even w/ frozen scallops.

I tasted the Vinegrette before adding to the scallops - glad I did because the vinegar flavor was too overpowering for my likging.So I improvised and mixed up another vinegrette subbing fresh squeezed lemon for the rice wine vinegar and added a few flakes of crushed red pepper.

Hubby actually gave this one a 5, but it was a little strong in the vinegar flavor for me.  I think we will tweak it a bit to our personal tastes, but we liked it a lot and will definitely be doing it again!  We had to use canned green chilis instead of a jalapeno, and chili powder instead of cayenne pepper, but it was still delicious!

Nice change of pace from my normal scallop recipes.  Best of course with really good oranges, or you can omit the oranges in my opinion.

Will definitely make this again.  the orange segments give it a nice zing.  Not spicy for those who may think the jalapano would heat it up.

My husband showed me the video version of this recipe (which was fun to watch with Chef John). I knew it would be a keeper, so I went out today to buy scallops and test it out. It was every bit as delicious as we expected and was so simple to prepare, yet gave such an elegant presentation. I enjoyed the sauce - not too much kick - just enough. I would be a traditionalist with this sauce and not make any changes - I liked it the way it was. Perfection!

So easy. This is one of the best scallop recipes I have ever tried. Yum! I did cut back to just one orange though and that was plenty. Definitely a keeper.

Used bay scallops as they were on sale. Dusted them with the cayenne pepper prior to cooking.  Added 1/2 orange to dressing - turned out great.  Served over rice and used the extra dressing on a green salad (made just enough scallops for two).

Loved it! Thanks for the tutorial for searing the scallops, it worked out nicely. I followed the recipe but forgot to get an orange. I sliced some mango instead and we enjoyed it. May try and add mango to the puree next time.

This was sooooo yummy!  I made the mistake of underestimating the heat of the jalapeno that I used, so I didn't use enough.  I also cooked the scallops a little longer than what was recommended (family  requirements---not me).  This is very delicious and will be made numerous times in this household!  Thanks once again, Chef John!  YUM!

This was amazingly easy to make and excellent to eat. My husband liked it as well.  The jalapeño sauce is not biting hot - important for me - but if you want to kick up the heat more, you can do so by the amount of cayenne you add to your scallops.  The only thing I would change is to use just one orange instead of two (for the two of us).  But the oranges were a great compliment to the meal.

These were a nice change from just plain seared scallops. I enjoyed how the orange segments added a nice sweetness to balance the cayenne on the scallops. I did have quite a bit of the vinaigrette left over, so I'd cut that back next time and just do it by eye. A little drizzle is really all you need. Nice recipe overall.

Delicious!!  Have made it two times. Second time added a second jalapeño and more cayenne pepper.  The spicy pairs so well with a bite of orange at the same time- sweet and spicy. I left out the vegetable oil 2nd time and cooked scallops in olive oil and a pat of butter which gave them a delicious flavor. 2nd time made vinagarette ahead of time and placed it in the fridge for a few hours and it made it a little thicker which I liked better. Made a side of jasmine rice, baked parmesan  asparagus with a arugula tangerine avocado jalapeño salad. Made it for 6 people and all raved about it!

Love Scallops! A fun fresh twist to other scallop recipes. I use Grape Seed oil for sautéing them - a higher heat oil / no taste.

This was really good.  I made a complete meal with it.  Noodles, red peppers, snow peas, avocado, and orange slices, all tossed with the jalapeño sauce. Served with the scallops on top.  My husband said it was so good he almost licked the plate.

Great Recipe!  I only added juice of 1 clementine to the vinaigrette and a couple of the pieces of the the clementine to the food processor to add a little bit more citrus flavor!  Went great with Scallops and Shrimp (added that too).

Excellent recipe! I did not use orange segments but that was just fine. I used left over vinaigrette for a pasta salad the next day. It was incredibly delicious. Marinated tomatoes overnight in vinaigrette and then added lots of veggies to cellentani pasta. OMG!! THANK YOU JOHN!!

Really tasty.  I did add a small clove of garlic and a teaspoon coconut palm sugar (kind of like brown sugar).  My husband and I really enjoyed the recipe along with a spinach and purple onion salad.  The dressing was great over both.

This recipe was easy and delicious. I left half the seeds in the jalapeño because I like a little bit of heat.  Also I saw on the comments that someone else used avocado as well to accompany the scallops and oranges.  It was an excellent balance of flavors and I will definitely make again! Thanks!

I made these the other day and we loved them. Made as written except I added some Thai basil because I have too much of it growing in garden. It added a nice flavor to the dish. I will make these again soon. Definitely a keeper here. Thanks Chef John!

Excellent! There are many delicious oils and vinegars that are infused with flavor, available at olive oil shops.  In the sauce, I used a blood orange infused olive oil.  I seared the scallops on high heat using grapeseed oil. Easy, tasty recipe I will make again.

This is a beautiful dish with delicious flavors (and it's incredibly fast and easy to make.)  I paired mine with Thai sticky rice and seared zucchini rounds.  Dinner was served in under 30 minutes.  I will make this one again and again.  Thank you for sharing, Chef John!!

Oh My Oh MY!!! Absolutely delicious. The recipe as written is to perfection. The sauce is out of this world. Don't be frightened by the jalapeño  what so ever. We grow both the mild and the traditional hot. I used the mild, but would  use the hot jalapeño , that you find in your local grocery store the next time. Loved It. Quick and Easy to boot.
Thank You for Sharing.

This dish was exceptional.  We made it for friends and used a cast iron skillet on the grill burner.  Applause all around.  We did kick up the heat a little though as we all enjoy spicy.  Will definitely make again.

Totally easy and quick! Delicious scallops. The jalapeño sauce was too runny. I wanted some to adhere to the scallops for color and flavor. Next time I'll increase the Dijon and reduce the vinegar and oil. And Hope it's not too hot.

Delicious! Made this for an appetizer at a dinner party for eight. I doubled the recipe but really didn't need to double the vinaigrette because there was plenty.  I plated the scallops on a bed of fresh organic spring mix lettuce and pea shoots then did the orange segment garnish and vinaigrette.  I got rave reviews!!

Loved the recipe as is.  Elegant presentation and very simple to make.  The vinaigrette went very well with everything.  I was very cautious with the cayenne pepper as I did not want it too hot, and just a light sprinkle on each side of the scallop was perfect. BONUS:  Very healthy, low fat meal served with side salad and roasted asparagus.

This recipe is incredible!   And so easy!  I had to substitute a green bell pepper because my jalepeno pepper mysteriously disappeared.  It was DELISH!

Superb! The vinaigrette is so flavorful. I think it would go nicely with other proteins too and maybe even add an orange slice to the vinaigrette to add a little sweetness. I am definitely going to be making this again. Thank you, Chef John.

Honestly, when I was making this, I thought, "Why am I making this?  This is just going to be scallops with oranges thrown on top & dressing over it."

I have to say that I love it.  What a simple recipe for such nice flavor.  It's even a bit elegant, in my opinion.  Enjoyed.

Scallops were good but the sauce turned into a green vinegar sauce, nothing else. If you don't like the taste of vinegar, stay away from this one.

This is my go-to scallops recipe. I make it exactly as written, and eat the scallops over a salad of greens; usually a mix of arugula, spinach and cilantro. The vinaigrette makes a perfect dressing for the salad. It's sweet, spicy, healthy perfection. Thanks Chef John!

The only change I made was to serve it over a spring mix salad including baby greens and spinach. My scallops were fresh and dry pack but, despite rinsing well, had some grit which detracted from the taste.

Excellent. The sauce elevates this dish. I was skeptical of the oranges, but it works really well. I might use blood oranges in the future. I would even consider an extra jalapeno.

I made it for my Dad and his girlfriend (who had never had scallops before). They both loved it. I had a slight problem with the sauce proportions because I miscalculated the heat of my peppers. But after some playing it was good. Added some fresh garlic and served with mashed red potatoes.

5 star restaurant quality exactly as written. Can’t wait to make it for dinner guests or for a party. My pan was quite large, and I did need a little more oil to keep the scallops from sticking.

I followed the recipe to a tea except I had Cutie oranges in the house so used slices of them instead of a navel orange.  They are easy to peel and we both felt they had the same effect.  I used only a partial jalapeno  for fear of the heat and it was perfect.

Easy to follow instructions.  I used a smoothie mixer instead of taking out the blender- less to clean up.  

Excellent Valentine's dinner,  I had a little rice and spinach on the side---- husband loved it!    I will be making it again.

This was so good.  I adjusted the vinaigrette a bit. I used 2 large jalapenos, 2 cloves of garlic, and went half white wine vinegar, and half lime juice. Didn't bother with the orange segments. Will be making this again, many times, hubby loved it!

GREAT vinegarette!  I used a blood orange and habanero instead of jalapeno to add a little sweet to the heat - it was fabulous!  This vinegarette would be delicious on anything - seafood (of course), fresh fruit, any meat, pasta, really anything :) Yum yum yum!

This was delicious! Only changes I made were to sub diced chili pepper (jalapeno too hot for me), and use honey mustard (to cut the tart vinegar a bit). Also added 1/4 tsp of spicy taco seasoning mix. Didn't have an orange, but did have a grapefruit, so added a little zest from it, then supremed the sections and added as a garnish, splashing a tiny bit of the juice into the dressing.  Wonderful!

The vinaigrette was the best thing ever. I recommend it for the scallops and any shellfish or even roast meats or poultry.

Used a can of mandarin oranges. Vinegarette was too tarte so added 2 slices of the orange and some juice from can till got flavor I liked. I seared scallops with my shrimp and added garlic powder to them in addition the cayenne and salt. Instead of pasta a lot of people paired with dish I served with Parmesan garlic mashed potatoes (no veggie with For first time in my life) and it was divine. Quick and simple- kept vinegarette in my ninja and pulsed it For last time just after plating the seafood so it was frothy. Can not wait to make again! Right blend of spicy and sweet. Thanks Chef John for the inspiration to a great meal!

I don't give five stars to many recipes, but when I saw that Baking Nana liked it, I knew it would be good. AND, I have confidence in Chef John - he has never led me astray. This recipe is an absolute winner. We loved it. Three of us gobbled 15 scallops and I didn't think about taking a picture until they were all gone.  Only one change: Instead of a full quarter cup of rice vinegar, I used half rice vinegar and half lemon juice. The rest I did exactly as Chef John recommended,  including the orange sections, which highlighted the scallops perfectly. I doubt I'll ever cook scallops any other way now - they were the best ever. Thanks again, Chef John.

Very easy to make and we'll make it again. My scallops were too "wet" and they didn't brown well in the pan so need to make sure they are dry so they brown nicely. The vinaigrette could have been thicker - it was a bit runny.

Very quick and simple recipe. Scallops are more filling than you'd think. Vinaigrette was delicious!

Would recommend adding more spice or leaving jalapeño membranes in if you'd like a spicier vinaigrette

This was very tasty and I would make it again.  I did not have any oranges so I used peaches and grilled them- it complemented the vinaigrette very well.

OMG this is a GREAT and simple recipe, thank you Chef John! My rendition I seared 8 XL scallops over a Himalayan salt block at extreme high heat. I added sautéed tomatoes at the end of the sear to infuse. I backed off the Dijon by 1 heaping tablespoon.  (overpowers the vinaigrette for my taste)

Chef John never disappoints!  I made this recipe without changes and it was great.  My husband loved the scallops.  I used some of the dressing and put over boneless chicken and baked (I don't eat seafood).  We both enjoyed our meals.  Next time I am in Trader Joe's, I will look for the orange balsamic as recommended by a previous reviewer.

Very tasty, and easy to make.  I might have preferred it to be slightly spicer, but I am sure with minor tweaks I can make that happen next time.

It was very good. I liked the vinaigrette sauce on the side.  I used 1/2 jalapeño pepper (seeds and membranes removed).  Sear the scallops on high heat or they will not be seared brown &  caramelize.  Used canned mandarin oranges on the side, would be good without.

I made as written but used another's suggestion to trade the rice wine vinegar for the Trader Joes one.  I would have preferred a little less Dijon taste but thought it was pretty good.

This was super easy and a really nice fresh flavor. Can see where you can easily spice things up if you'd prefer with jalapeños and or cayenne. But was perfect just as the recipe states.  Poured sauce over rice and served with broccoli.  Will DEFINITELY be making this again!

Scallops were fantastic but the dressing was just ok. I like vinegar and I thought it was too vinegary. The orange went surprisingly well with the scallop and vinaigrette, but next time I'd tweak the vinaigrette more to my tastes.

Really nice dish! Great change-up from the grilled fish I normally barb-a-que. Only difference is, I added a little of the juice from the orange into the jalapeno vinaigrette.

TEN THUMBS DOWN!!!!! I literally couldn't eat this meal. The only positive in this recipe is the combination of the jalepeno and the orange. So if you can come up with a better way to combine those 2 ingredients, I think you'll have a lot more success.

This was very good I like others thought the vinaigrette was a little vinagry and needed more spice so I added a medium deveined serrono pepper.
