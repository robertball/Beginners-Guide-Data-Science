I loved the quinoa as a meat substitute, but the recipe itself could definitely use more spices. It tasted heavy on the tomato and too bland

The flavor was good and it was simple to make. My 3 meat loving boys all ate it without a pause. You could easily add ground beef if you HAD to have meat. I could stand it a little spicier but that's a personal choice and easy to adjust to your own liking with some red pepper flakes or a Serrano.  Thanks, ill make this again.

I have made this recipe twice and enjoyed it very much, thank you for posting it.  As for the spices, everyone should spice to taste.

I added a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and doubled the beans.  My carnivorous family loved the vegetarian twist.  Using quinoa is a great substitute for ground meat.  Next time I'm going to add bell peppers and maybe some roasted corn.

It was much too saucy and too bland for our tastes. I upped the chili powder and cumin and added black pepper, cayenne pepper and oregano. I stirred some shredded cheese into it before serving, which helped with the overly tomato flavor. I think a green pepper would add some color and flavor as well. It's OK as a base recipe for us. It's the first time I've tried quinoa in chili, and it gave me a good idea what to do next time.

This is my new favorite "go-to" meal for my family!  We have tried other meatless chili recipes, and none came close to this one in flavor, texture or nutrition!  I doubled the recipe so I could share with friends and have leftovers.  Love it!
