I don't care for sweet pickles. Its only getting 2 stars because it was super easy but I wish i would have known they were sweet pickles. 
I was even questioning the 4 cups of sugar but figured it must be there to tone down the tart and salty. Next time I will listen to myself...
It was my first time making and canning pickles. It was easy to do but I will have to find a sour pickle recipe.

WAY too sweet for me, personally, my 2y/o and 3y/o eat them almost as fast as I can make them. I omit the turmeric, and use half distilled white vinegar and half apple cider vinegar. Great way to get through the explosion of cucumbers I'm experiencing in the garden. Thanks, Mandy007!
