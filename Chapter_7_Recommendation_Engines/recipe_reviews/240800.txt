Hi all, thank you for the reviews!  Some of you opted to cover the cabbage, that's a great idea.  I do love it charred but if it is too charred for you, you may want to alter the oven temp, since we all know everybody's oven is different!  I love the variations you are contributing as well, thanks so much!

Perfect! Baked at 425*, tented with foil, for 20 minutes and then removed and continued to roast for 20 more minutes. Excellent with our red beans and rice dinner. Thank you!

Roasted Cabbage Haiku: "A great recipe, but execution needs work. Should've been covered." Peering at the more recent reviews, I see folks mentioning that they covered their cabbage partially, which I guess I should've done b/c the texture of ours was mooshy in parts, and burnt in others. Absolutely adored the idea behind it and plan on doing it again, as we eat cabbage frequently and are always delighted to try new methods of preparing it.

This recipe is delicious.  I used bacon grease instead of oil and it added extra flavor.  I cut the cabbage in thick slices and my family loved the little extra burnt edges.  Will definitely make again.

Excellent recipe.  Used 425 degree.... added a little butter to the bottom of pan with the olive oil and left uncovered for the first 20 minutes.  I added grated cheese and covered for the last 20 minutes.... really delicious. Then the next time I mixed sour cream and grated cheese and a little milk and added this for the last 20 minutes for a cream cabbage. I will never boil cabbage again.... best recipe ever.

Awesome! I used olive oil cooking spray to evenly distribute the oil better. Great flavor and I LOVED the sweet/roasted/charred taste. I've never had/made roasted cabbage before, but I will be making it more often from now on~YUM!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

I am thinking it needs to be covered for the first 15 minutes, flipped, and baked for remainder of time uncovered.  No?  I found myself having to add more oil.  I am willing to make this recipe again.  I like the idea of baking wedges of cabbage, that is new for me.  And my family thought it was neat, lol.  It had great flavor too.  I think the firmness threw everyone off but I actually enjoyed that the most.  I just don't think it has to be THAT firm.  That is why I suggested covering for the first half of the baking time.

I followed the other reviews and tented the cabbage for the first 15 minutes, and then flipped and roasted without cover. Delicious and easy!

Tried this tonight.  I read the reviews first so based on that I used olive oil spray instead of brushing it on the cabbage.  I also tented with foil for the first 20 minutes.  I also used other seasoning as I have small children and didn't think they could do the pepper flakes.  It was awesome!!!! I also made with the pepper flakes for my hubby.  He loved it!!!! This will be in the vegetable rotation from now on!!!!

Lightly brushed with bacon grease instead of olive oil Used JD's Cheddar bacon salt, fresh ground black pepper, crushed red pepper flakes and garlic powder to taste. Roasted at 450° for 20 minutes loosely covered with foil then removed foil and roasted 10 minutes more on the same side. Flipped over all wedges and roasted an additional 10 minutes on opposite side. I made a whole cabbage cut into 8 wedges. I was still able to achieve some deep browning but avoided the char. The end result was deliciously bacon-flavored and definitely will do this way again! Sorry, no picture because the family woofed it down too fast!

Might add celery seed and perhaps a dash of balsamic vinegar and serve with some small dumplings and a nice slice of corned beef.

I had a large head of cabbage to use, found this recipe and followed it exactly as written.  When I ate the first wedge, I decided the lemon wasn't for me.  Next I tried a bit of apple cider vinegar which also wasn't "it".  Finally ate plain and really liked it!  Next time I'm going to use bacon grease or butter rather than oil and will bake a little longer in order to get more of the charred cabbage.  LOVE IT!!

I was surprised we liked this as much as we did.  I followed the other reviewers' suggestion of covering it for the first fifteen minutes and it came out beautifully.

This recipe is EXCELLENT.  I cut in half inch slices , or slabs if you will, rather than wedges.  Cooks more evenly.

Yum!  I've read some of the reviews and however you choose to alter the recipe this is a winner!  I love cabbage and was looking for ways to use the rest of the head of cabbage when I finished with making cole slaw.  This was great!  I'm going to try tenting it but not because this wasn't delish already...just a different way.

Thanks.

Baked at 425, tented with foil for the first 20 minutes and then roasted uncovered for 20 more minutes.  Used 3/4 T garlic infused olive oil for 1/2 small head of cabbage.  Seasoned with Penzey's Fox Point seasoning and  crushed red pepper.

I love when I find a new recipe for an old favorite. I love green cabbage and never thought to prepare it like this before. I did throw in some garlic cloves, rosemary and thyme sprigs from our garden and then sprinkled it with goat cheese after the lemon....OMG so amazing. Thank you so much for sharing this amazing recipe. We will be making this forever in our home. The best!

Loved this recipe! Perfection. I made it according to the directions; I did not use foil as so many suggested. I brushed olive oil on all sides. The charred tops is the best part of the dish.....so delicious! My family loves it, too! It's so easy and healthy. I loved the red pepper flakes which really spiced up an otherwise usual dish.

Love this recipe!!!  This is so easy.  Follow the directions & keep an eye on the color of it in the oven.  If it is getting dark on the edges too soon, cover with foil, your oven may run a bit hot.  And the addition of red pepper flakes was awesome, hubby & I love spicy.  This will be a low calorie go to for me forever.  Thanks!!

This was so delicious I ate all of it. Of course I tented it like so many people said to. Actually I sealed the foil around the pan. I also added time because my oven had not gotten to temperature. When I pulled it out of the oven and removed the foil. Wow was it cooked. Very charred on the edges (crispy black) and the bottom was caramelized. I probably could have eaten it at this point, but still turned them and put it back in the oven for another 15 minutes. I ended up eating the entire pan, including the core, with my fingers, by myself, standing in my kitchen working on a project.

I added two pictures so you could see the whole plate and the Cabbage Steak as well.  I cut mine into steaks and also did a pan of Roasted Peppers and Onions, as well as Rice on the side.  Made a delicious Vegetarian dinner! Just have to season to your own taste.  Remember you can always add more but you cannot take away.

Very good. I cooked in oven with some Chicken at 375 for 20 min each side and found it to be crunchy, nice flavor, and very satisfying.

I followed the top reviewer's suggestion of lowering temp to 425, cooking 20 min w/foil tent, remove foil and cook another 20 min. Even at the lower temp, some of the outsides of the cabbage were getting too scorched after the foil was removed. I had to take this out of the oven before the second 20 min. This may have worked better keeping the foil on. Nice flavor, and I'd make again.

What a surprise.  I'd never thought of roasting cabbage.  It tastes a little bit like roasted brussels sprouts, which I love.  I will make this again as written.

Not bad. The inside wasn't soft at all, maybe try spreading the cabbage out when it's in the oven? The darker green outer leaves were the most flavorful. Next time i'll just chop up the whole thing and lay it out on a baking sheet.

Excellent cabbage, if you've a cabbage lover this will quickly   become your favorite, if your a cabbage hater, this will definitely change your mind!  I used very little red pepper as per our personal taste otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written, thanks for the recipe!

Not a fan. The texture was mooshy and the lime/lemon was overpowering. Recommend covering the cabbage while cooking and 86 the lime/lemon.

Loved it!  Next time I would follow the directions to ale the cabbage in wedges and leave the core in so the pieces don’t come apart so easily. I removed the core and cut the cabbage into steaks. I also took the advice of others and foil tented thecabbage for the first half of cooking. Last half of the time I flipped the cabbage steaks to their other side and continued roasting uncovered. My oven is a bit slow so I gave them about 25 minutes per side. There were some very crisp and charred pieces which didn’t look pretty but were absolutely delicious! I will definitely make this again!

I made this with carrots, white onion, russet & red potatoes, 
& celery and seasoned with an Italian olive oil mixed by husband, kosher salt, garlic powder, garlic salt, black pepper and basil. I added the soft vegetables after the potatoes and carrots roasted for about 20 minutes at 400°. All was done within 25 minutes and it was delicious!!

Instead of adding olive oil, I placed  (4-5) slices of bacon on top of the cabbage...something my my mom used to do.  After reading reviews, I covered the  cabbage in foil for the first 15 minutes.  At the 15 minute mark, I took off the  foil, but did not flip the cabbage. It was a hit!

Absolutely love this!  I went heavy the olive oil and garlic pepper.  Baked on 425 *, uncovered for 25 minutes, flipped over, added bacon bits, baked for another 25 minutes. I had a problem cutting my wedges small, so I expected to bake longer. 
 My family loved it.

Great side dish -- put in the oven and let it go while you prepare main dish. The lack of measurements encouraged me to "go with my gut," using the recipe as a guide. Turned out great!

Will do again.  Leaving out 1 lemon, and perhaps adding some crunch such as small strips of carrots, maybe small covering of diced red bell pepper.   Definitely a good dish to experiment with.  Healthy, too.

Oh my gosh! This is fabulous. I didn’t cover. 15 minutes each side @ 420 degrees. I also threw some nutmeg in the spice mix. Served with beans and rice as another reviewer suggested and I’m on my guilt free second serving.  Thank you for posting this new (for me) way to cook cabbage.

Made these changes to the Roasted Cabbage receive a fantastic healthy way to eat cabbage. 
Added additional seasoning Mrs Dash  with garlic (blue cap) vinegar, sugar, and Dill.  I used coconut oil 
I added the salt and sugar into a pan of warming coconut oil. Then added the remaking seasonings and brush on the cabbage wedges Bake at 425 for 15 turn over base with coconut oil and bake for 15 more minutes.

Followed the recipe and LOVED it! the only thing I will change for next time is to pull apart the cabbage so the spices and oil get into the center better. Also I honestly preferred the charred bits more so will do away with the foil that others suggested.
Thank you for a tasty healthy option for dinner.

I tried this recipe tonight, the cooking time is way off the mark, whether its 425° or 450°. I tented for the first 20 minutes, then another 20 minutes without foil. still took another 20 minutes, and required cutting up the quarters to get it to cook.

It was fine.  If you are huge cabbage fan this is probably a good recipe.  I had some cabbage I wanted to use up so I tried this.  Its good, but I probably wouldn't buy cabbage just for this recipe.

Thankful to have another cabbage recipe---and this one is very flavorful.  Since I didn't have garlic powder, I put in garlic pepper and added Ranch dressing powder as well.  Everything else stayed the same.  I put toothpicks in the wedges to help hold them together and put  foil over them for the entire time.  Some parts still needed a good knife to get through some of the ribs, but the rest was tender.  Served with Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kebobs on this site.  Husband enjoyed something a bit different and it's low-carb, if you count carbs.

Used cayenne pepper because I didn't have any red pepper flakes. The cabbage came out soft in some places, hard in some places and charred in others, but that could be because I cut it wrong. Will make again.

Tried this recipe and it turned out very tasty and delicious.  I plan on using my grill the next time I make this recipe. Used paprika since my family is not into the hot peppers.  I like Crystal hot sauce and think this may add some zip to the cabbage.

YES !!!  I will make this again.  My husband and myself loved the cabbage cooked this way.  It was delicious.  We both love cabbage anyway, but this was really good.  The red pepper flakes gave it a little pop that was great.

Had a large head of cabbage. Cut it into 8 good-sized wedges then brushed w/bacon grease as others suggested (oh so good!) and seasoned w/seasoned salt & garlic powder (didn't do the pepper flakes or lemon). Tented w/foil and baked @425 first 20 mins then removed and baked 15 mins more. My family fought over this! This will become a regular for sure!!!

I used chipotle powder instead of red pepper flakes. It turned out great! This is a nice recipe to experiment with, roasting with curry mixtures, etc. Great job! 
PS: I forgot to say I mixed the spices wit the olive oil and then brushed it on. I thought it might help carry them into the cabbage leaves better, but probably there's no difference!

Cut cabbage in even steak sizes. Sprayed with olive oil spray. Put spices as directed except did not have garlic powder. I liked the red pepper flakes kick. Put peeled shaving of ginger on top. Threw in baby carrots and whole garlic cloves.  Roasted it at 425 degrees for 20 minutes turn then 20 minutes more. Wonderful! Served this with two poached eggs on a cabbage steak.

The red pepper flakes give a nice kick. I changed it up a bit. Used ghee, instead of olive oil and roasted the wedges on parchment.  I'll definitely make again, such an easy recipe.

I made the covered variation of this recipe. After reading the reviews I took a little bit from one and a little bit from the others. I used bacon grease on the bottom of the baking sheet and rolled the 4 quarters to cover in the bacon grease. I then sprinkled with Roasted Garlic, Red Pepper Flakes and NOOCH (nutritional yeast) which took the place of the cheese. Then I sprayed a light coating of olive oil over everything which sent the seasoning down into the cabbage. After 20 minutes I flipped the quarters and added a bit more NOOCH (I’m a cheesy freak) and continued baking for the additional 20 minutes to get it charred. I have made this twice now but I didn’t have the full 40 minutes the first time so I halved the quarters and reduced the baking time to a total of 20 minutes. Both times this recipe has left me wanting more!

Spiced just right, this is the perfect way to use up any cabbage leftover after making coleslaw.

Had friends over. We all loved this! I followed exactly. No need to tent this. We thought the charred edges were the tastiest part!

I  made this & we loved it!   Prefer this to cabbage in a stew or soup!   I added bacon to it, which was delish!!!   Cut bacon into small pieces & topped the cabbage w it & cooked it for the duration of the time..    Liked the crispy charred parts too.  (Think I cooked it at 400 by mistake, which seemed great actually).    Yum!   Will definitely make this again and not just on Nee Years day!   :)

A simple way to eat more cabbage. We love cabbage, so this was perfect. We used the spray olive oil and substituted fresh ground black pepper. This will be a regular dish.

I've grown to love cabbage and this was quite good.  So easy and healthy.  I used a bit more than a "dash" of the seasonings and opted to sprinkle a scant amount of soy sauce, or Bragg's onto the wedges.  I really believe 2 whole lemons is overkill, thus 4, not 5 stars.  Will make again for sure, (with just a little squeeze of lemon, maybe)!

Very tasty.  I added sliced onion and a slice of bacon chopped up.  Also generous sprinkling of lemon pepper.   Tented for 3/4 of cooking time and cooked about 40  mins.   Very good.

Love this simple and delicious recipe! I too tent the cabbage for the first side, remove foil, flip, and continue cooking for remainder. I cook both sides for 20-25 minutes, just watching for doneness. Additionally, I use coconut oil, but only because I use CO for everything.

The cabbage became somewhat chewy.  I will stick to the pan-fried cabbage preparation.

Try the skillet ham, cabbage and potatoes on this site.

I just made this recipe, and as one of the other said I think that the next time I try this I will cover it for the first 15 minutes. I used a very small head of cabbage and I didn't want to cut entirely in half so I sliced a wedge out of it and next time I would cut it in half and then cut the wedge as my wedge fell apart. I will try this one again.

This was terrific! The only changes I made was melted butter instead of oil. Super tasty. I used the same temperature but shortened the second side cook time by 5 minutes. My husband who wrinkled his nose when I told him what we were having, was brave enough to try it and then gobbled it down and said don't change a thing??

5 stars for a tasty healthy side dish recipe.  If you like roasted or grilled veggies, this is one you should try.  My cabbage came out a bit al dente which is how we prefer our grilled/roasted vegetables - not super soft but with a bit of "bite".  Ovens cook differently so, know your oven and roast/keep your eye on your cabbage accordingly. : ) Cooked as instructed.  Seasoned with a bit of salt, pepper, garlic powder, pinches of cayenne due to lack of chile flakes.  Served with grilled chicken and steak.  Perfect!  Didn't have to take up room on the grill.  : )  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was so easy and the perfect complement to kielbasa! Lemon is crucial for bringing out the flavors and spices. My boyfriend loved it - says "TOP 5"! We used seasoning mentioned and additionally flavored ours specifically for our individual tastes: he likes hot/spicy and dusted his with ghost pepper seasoning; I used garlic salt in lieu of salt and cumin. We did not need to flip and they turned out fine @ 425 for 15 mins.

Ugh. Did not care for this at all. I cooked it for the specified 30 minutes and seasoned it as directed. It was crunchy/tough/chewy and oh so boring tasting (except for my burning mouth thanks to the red pepper flakes). I love cabbage in other recipes. :(

DISCLAIMER: I may have cooked it at 425 as opposed to the 450 degrees. Maybe the extra heat would have made a difference in the texture but I'm not sure it would have helped the flavor.

The cabbage was crunchy so if you want it softer it will take twice as long to cook.It was very tasty and I will make it again with a roast. I added more oil  as well.

Perfect. I didn't tent. The crispy bits are the best part. Don't worry about timing, just roast until edges get black and flip. It'll all depend on how thick you slice the cabbage. I sliced mine pretty thin and roasted for 15mins then flipped for 5.

This was not a popular recipe at our table.  I gave it two stars but the rest of the family would give it one.  I would only try this recipe if your family loves cabbage.  Our cabbage didn't cook evenly with parts charred and other parts super crunchy.

Oh wow!! I have never roasted cabbage before and came across this recipe on a search for something with cabbage aside from Cole slaw. I loved this!! It was very tender and delicious. I covered the cabbage with tin foil (per other reviews) & roasted it at 425 for 40 minutes (last 15 minutes uncovered) turning it half way. When seasoning the cabbage drizzle some olive oil and seasonings into the inside of the cabbage by gently separating the leafs while managing to keep the cabbage together. Will definitely be making this again as it was a quick easy and healthy alternative for cabbage.

This is carmelized vegetable heaven! The first time I made it, I forgot the lemon juice at the end, but it was still delicious. The second time I had some baby carrots I needed to use up, and they were just as tasty as the cabbage. This recipe might be my new fave go-to for roasting vegetables.

This was simply awful.  Made it exactly as written and not only was it too spicy but it was cooked unevenly, some parts were cooked others were not.  I'll go back to boiled or braised thanks. Won't be repeating this one ever again.

Very tasty; however, I did change the technique a bit. Spooned some leftover breakfast sausage grease from this morning in the bottom of a glass casserole, laid the wedges inside, spooned a bit more grease on top, didn't have much, so then sprayed some cooking spray on top.  Just seasoned the one side of the cabbage and didn't bother with any flipping.  Baked at 425 degrees for 20 minutes with some foil laid on top, and then removed and baked another 20 minutes.  Came out perfect--just the right amount of char and tenderness.  The flavor was fantastic!  Will definitely make again.

I sliced the cabbage into thin wedges. As others suggested, I only used olive oil spray. I added garlic powder, caraway seeds, and a few red pepper flakes. I also tented for 20 minutes at 425 and turned cabbage over, uncovered, and cooked for 20 more minutes. Then I added  few sprinkles of Hawaiian sea salt. I normally fry cabbage in butter and always feel so guilty! Now I have an awesome alternative. I could have eaten the entire dish before serving it!

I've never thought about roasting cabbage. I used an air fryer and it was delicious! I did not take notes on how long or what temp. I just like roasted veggies that get a little caramelized, little brown on the edges. Not soggy and mushy. The lemon was a little surprise. A dab of butter always helps when served too.

Roasted cabbage was fantastic! It really did taste good. I'm used to overcooked, watery, limp cabbage with my corned beef. I sure like cabbage now! I followed the recipe exactly as written and appreciated the added comment to try and get as much of the core on sections you cut. It does make some of them stay together better. Friends and family want this recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly. The two outer leaves were tasty, being a bit charred, but the rest didn't really seem to cook? Maybe I did something wrong. Nobody ate them though... :( Won't be making again. ... unless maybe you cover them and then cook them a bit longer?

I made as stated and really liked it a lot, although the outer leaf was a little too done for us.  I may try covering it with foil for part of the cooking time when we have it tonight.

I've made a lot of roasted veggies in my day, but never thought of doing cabbage........big mistake.....it was delicious!  I roasted in a 420* conv. bake oven for about 20 min. or so, watch close as some leaves want to burn.   Also used about a 1/2 t. of garlic spice blend and pls don't skip the lemon....really finishes it off nicely.    Such a wonderful dish of a underused  veggie, and oh so healthy.   I also cut back on the olive oil, but didn't measure...sorry.   Go easy on the pepper flakes can be a bit spicy.  Will make this often....thanks!

I was pleasantly surprised. It was delicious. I used red cabbage instead. I made it to put in a salad but excellent on its own.

Made these as a side dish for the Vera Cruz snapper that is also on AR. I just adore cabbage and this was super simple and tasted great. I did use limes instead of lemons as that was what I has on hand.

Cooked 20 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered. I did not flip half way thru and will next time. I used onion powder, paprika, and red paper flakes (what I had on hand). It was delicious. A definite keeper.

Made it as a side dish to corned beef, instead of the usual steamed corned beef and cabbage. It was much better than steamed. I would have liked it to be a little crisper but there's so much water in cabbage it kind of just steams itself a little in the oven. Still very good. Took it to a potluck and people liked it.

Not much to change here, only amount of garlic and spices---I pretty much stuck with the directions and the cabbage was delicious. I also roasted the carrots and small white potatoes so everything was done at the same time, clean up was a snap----perfect with the corned beef. I did put it in the oven for a couple of hours at the 250 temp, worked  fine.

I have tweaked this just a bit, I mix the olive oil, garlic powder, add lot of ground black pepper, and some lemon concentrate to taste, mix well and brush both sides, also re brush down side when I flip them. I am going to try other flavors, and seasonings, like wasabi powder, mixed with olive oil, and a little mustard. Have fun with this recipe !

Made this for dinner tonight for the two of us, along with several other recipes from this site (J. P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits and CindyD's Somewhat Southern Fried Chicken). I do so love bacon and cabbage, so microwaved 3 strips of Wrights bacon until crunchy, pour the bacon grease over the 1 inch wide cabbage wedges in a bowl and, by hand, gently rotated and turned to coat all the wedges. Placed wedges on an aluminum covered sheet pan and sprinkled all other spices on top.  I preheated the oven to 425 because I wanted the biscuits and the cabbage to be in the oven at the same time. Biscuits were ready by the 15 minute turnover time for the cabbage and it was ready 15 minutes later. Crumbled the 3 crispy bacon slices and sprinkled over the roasted cabbage wedges before serving.  Now that I know the timing/heat for these  for my oven, next time I will put the cabbage in first, turn and then bake the biscuits. We loved it!

I made this for dinner tonight. WoW!  It's my new favorite way to cook cabbage.  It was delicious. I wouldn't change a thing. I wasn't sure how thick to make the slices so I had to add 5 minutes to the cooking time.  My slices were about 3/4 of an inch thick to 1 inch.

We love cabbage and having it roasted is a treat. I did tent it for the first half which I know helped it. I did use too much red pepper flakes and not enough olive oil but otherwise it was awesome.! I'll make it again. Thank you everyone for your tips.

I made it without adding the lemon (didn't have any at the time) and it was great, and......I probably used more than two tablespoons of oil to cover each piece on both sides.

I would definitely make it again.  I was clearing the fridge and found a 1/2 cabbage that had seen better days and needed to be cooked asap.  I ended up losing track of time (I was preparing lamb meatballs too for later in the week) and some of the leaves became actual chips.  What a wonderful mistake!  My teenager and I had happy tummies afterwards.

I tented it for 20 min. and then cooked it for another 15 at 425. My husband loved it and we even forgot to add the lemon! This is definitely going to become one of my favorites.

I made as directed with green cabbage. Looked nice but wasn't anything I'd eat or serve again. I'll stick to roasting brussel sprouts - same idea but much tastier.

Maybe if the cabbage is boiled first it wouldn't taste so crunchy/raw. Also, the layers of cabbage fell apart when flipping them over.

We liked this alright but my outer leaves really burned at the loose end and it was kind of dry even though I ended up covering it for about half the time. We like a crunch to many of our veggies but the dryness made this a less enjoyable kind of crunch. The charred flavor was nice on the main part, and the burnt outer leaves were easily avoided but it wasn't something that I would make again without changes.
