These came out great - I used cocktail cherries cause one of my daughters doesn't like blueberries. Super easy to make and great for school pot luck. I left of the jam as well cause I was in a hurry, so mine did not look quite as realistic as the original but kids loved them just the same. I told them they were ogre eyes :-)

Made these for my grand niece's halloween party - we called them "cyclops eyeballs" and the red inside was sugar palm fruit in syrup which they had at the Asian store where I bought the canned lychee

Made these for a teenage Halloween party. I ended up using sweet dark cherries from a can as half the kids said they wouldn't eat blueberries. I smeared the strawberry jam all over the "eyes" as well as a little inside. These turned out to be a hit!  I even used the little sword skewers for a festive effect. Delicious!!
