5+++!!  I never would have though to use enchilada sauce as a soup base but it is a genious idea.  So delicious!  I used broth instead of bouillon and black beans instead of chicken substitute.  It was absolutely wonderful-so healthy and easy too!  Thanks-I'll definitely be making this regularly!  Note:  If you want a brothy soup with pieces of tortilla in it, don't add your tortillas until just before serving, even just directly into the bowl and pour the soup on top & stir.  If you cook it too long with the tortillas in, they will break apart and thicken the soup.  It's great both ways-we LOVED it!

I made this soup for a work carry-in and it was NOT a hit.  Why am I giving it 5 stars?  The next day, the leftovers were fabulous!  This soup gets better with age.  My advice, make it the day before so that it can 'cure' in the refrigerator.  YUMMY!!

This is a easy dish to make.  When I can't find green enchilada sauce, I make the recipe with red enchilada sauce and a small can of green chilies. We had this last night --love it.

This was great!!  I couldn't find green enchilada sauce so I used red... we were all nearly in tears because it was so spicy, but it still tasted great!  I used morningstar farms vegetarian 'chicken' strips (which I love in nearly anything!) and I added extra tortillas.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

***************update: one night while making this, I added a can of refried beans on a whim.. it was great!!  Great soup all around, thanks!!

I have made this a few times and I love it!  So easy and tasty!  The first time I made it I was nervous because we had friends from Mexico over and they said it was the best tortilla soup they had had since they left!  I have only used red enchilada sauce because I always prefer red to green. I have made this vegetarian, substituting vegetable broth for buillion and dropping the chicken substitute and I have made it non-vegetarian with boiled and shredded chicken instead of the chicken substitute and using chicken broth instead of buillion.  I like it both ways!  I typically double the beans and corn and it is great with black beans instead of pinto for a slightly prettier appearance.

Awesome recipe!!! I used 2 of the smaller cans of the green enchilada sauce and also added 1 can of black beans as I omitted meat and I also used 1 can of corn instead of frozen. I cooked all ingredients in a crock pot and let cook for a few hours stirring occassionally. I broke up pcs of corn tortilla before serving. I served with sour cream and it was incredible. I also crushed up some tortilla chips and sprinkled in my bowl for some crunch. Will for sure make again!

Great recipe! I live in San Diego so I can be a bit picky about my Mexican food, but this recipe is super easy and tasty. Followed the recipe exactly and turned out perfectly, but lots of room for substitutions/extra veggies if you prefer.

Very good and EASY..which is key for me...I used 2 cloves fresh garlic and vegetable broth instead of bouillon/water.  Also added some red pepper flakes...I was so hungry I had some as soon as done..lol..but I can see as someone else stated, I bet it will have an even better flavor tomorrow!  Thank You!

Really delicious for how fast and easy it is, and it's even better the next day. I'm a meat eater and usually am wishing for meat to add to veggie dishes but I didn't miss a thing with this dish.

This was great but SPICY and we love spicy food. I used a medium verde sauce, omitted the beans and added 2 diced chicken breasts. I also added juice from 1 lime and sliced tortilla strips. This is definatly a soup I will make when I need to clean out a stuffy nose or sinus infection. Yum!!

This recipe probably relies hevily on the brand of sauce you used and maybe thats why I didn't enjoy as much as others seemed to.  Stew's broth came out too syrupy and salty for my taste.  Because it is such an easy recipe and everyone else thought so highly of it, I will probably try again with a different brand.  Any suggestions?

This was pretty good, but even with a few tweaks, I found it was lacking something. I put the chili powder and cumin in a dry pan and started roasting them to really open up the flavor. I tossed in 1/4 of an onion, minced, and instead of garlic powder, 3 cloves of minced garlic. Once that sauteed I added the enchilada sauce (Hatch brand), chicken broth in place of water and 1/2 tsp oregano. Since I was going the non-veg route, I added 5 chicken tenders and simmered them for 15 minutes in the sauce. I removed them, let them cool 5 minutes, shredded them and tossed them in the pot. I didn't have frozen corn, so I used one can, drained and rinsed. I omitted the beans since the soup was already so hearty, even after adding extra broth. Not bad, but a lot like other tortilla soups. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Fantastic!  I loved that it was hearty, healthy, tasty and EASY.  I made a few minor modifications (chicken broth, extra tomatoes, crispy tortilla strips) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Served with popovers and green salad.  I will make this easy meal again and again.

Great recipe!  I also used the red enchilada sauce and 1 can of green chiles.  I used the pinto beans it called for, plus a can of kidney beans in place of the veggie chicken because I don't care for faux meats in general.  Kidney beans were all I had-- it was great with kidney beans, but next time I will use black beans.  I used vegetable broth instead of the bouillon cube and water.  I threw everything in a crock pot and put it on high for about 2 hours and it was great, but it was definitely very spicy.  Additionally, I used crunched tortilla chips, shredded Mexican cheese, and sour cream as toppings for this soup and it was outstanding!  If anyone is looking for a side dish/ dessert, I recommend the sweet corn cake dish that you can find in packages in the Mexican foods aisle.  It made the meal feel complete.

This was fantastic!!! I used chicken bouillon and extra chili powder since I had no cumin.  Also added finely diced garlic and onions and skipped the garlic powder. Added some lime for kick. I also added chopped corn tortilla before reducing, the tortillas disintegrated and gave it an extra thickness and heartyness. I add chopped tortilla on it right before serving for "the look".  LOVED IT!!    I let the soup reduce for a couple of hours to make it thick and hearty.  It was so easy to make a absolutely delicious. I can't wait to see what it'll taste like after a day or two of refrigeration like someone suggested.  I'll definitely make this again.

Excellent stew that is extremely easy to make.  I did make a few changes that I think really improve this recipe.  I fry onions, garlic, and green/red pepper in oil until cooked, and then add the enchilada sauce and broth. I really dislike fake chicken, so I add sliced veggie brats instead. My family of non-vegetarians really enjoyed it.

Adding hot sauce adds a nice amount of flavor to the soup, and if you can't remember cumin, extra chili powder works just fine. I accidentally bought sweet corn, but it still tasted quite delicious. Using cracked up hard taco shells are very delicious in this soup if you don't want to use soft tortilla.

Ridiculously easy and very delicious! I could only find a 14oz can of green sauce, so I substituted 5oz of vegetable broth for the rest since I already had it in the refrigerator. I used two big cloves of garlic since I didn't have any garlic powder, and everything else I did according to the recipe as written. We will definitely be making this again!

I actually started out following the recipe for this one, but of course strayed. I used everything except the chicken substitute, cilantro (ew), and corn tortillas. THEN added two cans of potatoes, diced; a can of black beans; a large can of diced green chiles; a very healthy sprinkle of nutritional yeast; and half a can of refried beans to thicken, a whole can would have been better. I wanted to make just a small amount, but that never happens. I was eating this for a week. Thankfully it was good, especially over tortilla chips with cheese and sour cream.

This is a truly great tortilla soup recipe both for vegetarians and for meat eaters.  I do have to caution about one element that I think is very important.  Find and use green enchilada sauce.  It is not always the easiest to find, but it makes the dish.  I have used the red before and it is just not the same in my opinion.  I believe I followed the recipe exactly, only omitting the tortilla strips.  Bravissimo!

This goes together fast and tastes delicious.  I generally make things exactly as the recipe states the first time around before I add any personal touches.  The only thing I did differently the second time around was add a small chopped onion and half a diced, seeded jalapeno for some heat.  My husband says I should make it more often every time he has it:)

I have made this on multiple occassions and it has always been yummy. I only use green enchilada sauce and water, only b/c I don't usually have vegetable bouillon. I add a can of green chilies to really spice it up and I prefer white corn.  I've also added grilled salmon. Don't forget ots and lots of cilantro and corn tortillas.

This was excellent and the kids really liked it too.  I didn't know what green enchillada sauce was so I used something called salsa verde...I'm thinking it's probably close the same thing?? Anyway, it turned out awesome with it.  I used canned corn instead of frozen and black beans (what I had on hand) and didn't have the veggie chicken.  Other than that, no changes and great results! I will be making this again and again...

This really is delish and I learned a bit about altering my typical recipe towards being vegetarian.  However, I think I'll stick with my typical recipe most of the time (2 parts broth to 1 part salsa, with as many onions and summer squashes chopped up and thrown in as you like, with nothing else added until individuals add to their own bowls: protein of choice, tortillas, and optionally some FF cheese or sour cream - BTW we like the veggies either cooked until just tender, or cooked to bits, but not so much the half-way overcooked version).  Anyway, I'll probably stick with that broth/veg as a base prior to serving, and this is the reason why:  by weight watcher's standards, the base for my regular recipe is point free.  That means that some members of my family can add lots of extra calories (such as my 15 yo 6'1" son and my active husband), while my 11 yo daughter and I add in smaller amounts of the extras - in keeping with our individual caloric needs.  -  Anyway, there might be times when I'll serve this yummy version as a change of pace, as it really is delish....  Yum!  Most of all, thanks for sharing - somehow I hadn't thought of using beans in my own soup instead of the chicken that was suggested by the original recipe, and then one of your reviewers taught me that these soups can be thickened by adding tortillas earlier in the cooking process...............  Pretty cool!

Good but, my choice of a green salsa in substitution for green enchilada sauce made for a nearly too-hot-to-eat dish. And we loooove hot food! Next time, I'll use something else, and it may go up to 5 stars. Used dehydrated soy-chicken, and that was great.

Loved it!  I used half green enchilada and half red enchilada sauce.  Guest thought it was fabulous.  I would ditch the chicken substitute.  It did not add much in my opinion or I would go with real shredded chicken.

Really good soup, despite it being summer.  I would enjoy this even better during the cold winter.  Anyway, in Canada it's almost impossible to find green enchilada sauce at the grocery store.  I was able to find Herdez brand green salsa, so I used that.  I used homemade veggie broth instead of the bullion, and I also substituted black beans for pinto beans.  It's really yummy and has a nice kick that compliments guacamole and sour cream.

The green enchilada sauce I got was "mild" which made this dish SOOOO mild.  We (the parents) ended up adding hot sauce to ours which helped to spice it up and even the kids gobbled theirs up :)

This was incredible.  Everyone who ate it wanted more! I added some refried beans to the mix too. I have been looking for a vegetarian version of this soup that rocks and this is it! Enjoy.

Loved it!! I added fire roasted tomatoes instead of regular, and the whole can.  I had white corn tortilla chips on hand, and used those up instead of corn tortillas.  I just crushed them on top with the sour cream and cheese and it was awesome.  Very easy recipe, and very tasty!

Oh. My. Gosh. and Holy Cow, too!! I only made this b/c of all the great reviews, so in case there's someone else out there like me, I thought I'd better add another! This was SO good, and (for once) I followed the recipe exactly. (Well, I planned to, until I realized I had tortilla chips, not corn tortillas.) That being said, I added the chips and cheddar cheese at the end, and it was better than the Tortilla Soup they served at Chili's when I worked there. Thank you so much for this recipe. This will DEF become my new favorite "comfort food!" BTW, it would be just as good w/o the "chicken."

With a 6 month old baby at home, this stew was easy, quick and delicious.  I couldn't find the green enchilada sauce, so I used "salsa verde" instead.  I also added tofu instead of the veggie chicken substitute and served it with shredded cheese on top.  This was a crowd pleaser.  I will be making it again.

I thought it was vegetarian tortillas soup.  It tated like it.  My husband and I love it.  We garnish with sourcream, and tortillas chips.  To make torritllas chips, I used 2 corn tortiallas and butter both sides.  Sliced thin strips and bake it at 350 degree until golden brown, about 8-10 minutes.

As a vegetarian (not vegan), I loved the idea of getting to eat tortilla soup! And using enchilada sauce as a base was genius! This turned out fabulous using either green or red sauce.

I thought it was really good, my boyfriend, Mom and grandmother enjoyed it too. I used 2 cans of pinto beans instead of 1 and used the red enchilida sauce. I put some cheese on top when I was ready to eat it was really good!

This was pretty good.  I sauteed chopped onion and green pepper with garlic and salt and pepper in vegetable oil.  Then added all of the other ingredients.  I used chicken stock instead of water, and beef bouillon instead of vegetable bouillon.  I did not add the cumin or cilantro just because I don't like those flavors.  I had a can of mexican chili beans and corn.   Then I chopped up a zucchini that I had.   I did not add chicken.  Served with shredded cheese on top.   I love soup recipes that have a great base and are very easy to adapt to whatever ingredients you have on hand, and this is one of those.  I will be making this again.

So darn good!  I doubled the recipe and I'll be eating soup for a week... not that I'm complaining, because it's delicious.  I used chicken broth instead of veggie, and used one can of pinto beans and one can of chili beans, undrained, which I think added a nice flavor to it.  The enchilada sauce is fairly salty, so I didn't find that it needed any extra salt.  It's fabulous with shredded cheddar on top!  I'll be making this again!

Awesome recipe! I made some small changes, including doubling up on the tomatoes and omitting the beans. I also added a pound of browned grass-fed ground beef with taco seasoning to fill it out because of surprise guests, but I'll totally be making this vegetarian for my no-meat weekdays  This was a huge hit with my parents, my wife (twice), my friend, and my 2-year-old daughter!

My boyfriend and I did not like this at all. Most of the flavor came from the enchilada sauce and we didn't like it as a soup base at all.

DELICIOUS!!! The green enchilada sauce makes a fantastic soup base... a lil kick but not too overpowering. I used the Morningstar "chicken" strips for a vegetarian soup. The hubby raved... even more delicious the next day, after the soup has sat overnight.

Added green and red peppers and onions.  Make sure to add the green onion and sour cream suggested.  Overall, its a good soup, but I have made better ones.

I couldn't stop eating this! The only changes I made were using a can of chili beans (not rinsed), used fresh pico de gallo instead of the tomatoes and a whole can of canned corn (I don't like frozen) and it turned out AMAZING. I love cilantro so added much more and served with a dollop of sour cream and added some hot sauce. Would definitely make this again.

I was skeptical.  But wow!  I made two crockpots- one vegetarian, and one Non-veggie (but I used the same basic recipe). EVERYONE had seconds (and that never happens!)     This is a wonderful recipe as-is, or to use as a base for alterations!

Yummy. :-)  Since I'm not a vegetarian, I used chicken bouillon and real cut-up chicken in it.  I make plenty of non-meat dishes, but also didn't see a reason to find veggie chicken just to keep it "official."  I also have never purchased green enchilada sauce and just used red that I already had.  It was a bit, well not too spicy exactly, but just tasted a bit too much like enchilada sauce soup.  I will try adding more of the water/bouillon next time to try to drown that out a bit.  I didn't down-score it cause of that, since I'm the one who substituted w/red.

This is my favorite stew.  I've made this three times and each time when I've opened the can of enchilada sauce I found it was red that I bought by mistake.  At least once I want to try it with the green sauce but my sub-conscious must want the red and no wonder because it is so delicious that way.  I did use hominy instead of corn and whatever kind of bean I have on hand.  I'm making it again tomorrow to share with my neighbor who is ill.  This time on purpose I'm using red.  I'll use the green someday.  Thanks for the recipe, my favorite.

SOO GOOD!!  I was craving a bowl of hearty soup and this looked soo easy and I had just about everything on hand.  I couldn't find the green enchilada sauce or salsa verde so I used the red enchilada sauce. I used black beans instead of pintos (2 cans) and decided to put in a can of green chilies. I was worried about it being to spicy and it was spicy!  But this was sooo delicious.  It was prepared in 20 minutes and I served this with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese!  This was just perfect.  I can't wait to try the leftovers!  BF had 2 bowls and contemplated a 3rd!

Very easy.  I used 2 cups of vegetable broth and used black beans instead of corn.  I also omitted the "chicken" strips.  It tasted good the next day for lunch as well as fresh at dinner.  I would definitely make again.

I made this soup for a soup club at work and everyone seemed to LOVE it.  Some of my modifications included: cubes of tofu, regular corn tortilla chips instead of the strips, and cheease, sour cream, and lime to top of each bowl.  I used a spicy green salsa for the broth which is why I served it with sour cream on the side; and as for the chips, I would break some up in a bowl and then ladle the soup directly over the chips.  After a 2 minutes, the chips would be nice and soft.

I loved this with my own spin on it.  I added more pinto beans (maybe a cup)that were blended with my hand blender, it thickened the soup up a bit. I too used red enchilada sauce because I had it on hand. I also added about a half package of cream cheese to make it nice in creamy.  We all loved it!

I'm from new Mexico which is known for the green chili, so I wanted to try this recipe.  it is very good but I did make some changes.  However, they are not vegetarian additions.  First of all, I doubled the recipe and I used chicken broth instead of the water (only two cups), and I added 2 cups of diced boneless chicken thighs.  To spice it up some I added several dashes of jalapeno hot sauce.

Absolutely delicious!  Quick and easy to make.  You'd never know by tasting it, just how easy it was to make.  
I substituted canned vegetarian veggie broth instead of the bouillon cube and water as I had the cans handy.  
I did add veggie turkey (couldn't find chicken at my store) and it really gave it a nice texture.  This one is a keeper.

A+  . . . So many compliments every time I make it.  I start with the saute of onion and garlic - use the large can of green enchilada sauce - vegetable broth instead of bouillon/water -  black beans - a can of Trader Joes corn - and so far I keep forgetting the "add the tortilla part" ... but I always serve with corn chips, ... chopped green onion,  grated sharp cheddar, and sour cream.  Quick - Easy - Delish       Thanks Mindy

I made this based solely off the reviews. There are so few ingredients, I wasn’t sure how flavorful this would be. This was very tasty. My kids liked it a lot which is always a bonus. I put this in the crockpot on low for 4 hours which I think helped to develop the flavors. I used a can of black beans and a can of pinto beans and puréed  some of the soup in my Vitamix to make it a thicker soup. I would make this again.

Great recipe. Everyone loved it. Love how simple and fast it is the make. Thank you. 

My only changes that I made were minced garlic instead of garlic powder and I added some green onions when I added the cilantro. Topped it with shredded pepperjack and sour cream. Perfect.

I made this, it was ok not that much flavor. I added 1/4 cup of onions, 1/2 cup of orange bell pepper, 1/4 tsp fajita seasoning, used Chipotle diced tomatoes and omitted the corn.

I used red enchilada sauce rather than green (since that is all I could find) and it turned out delicious. I usually have a hard time making soups, but this one turned out fantastic.

This was delicious!!! Made a few alterations .... used red enchilada sauce instead of the green, added a can of black beans instead of meat substitute, added a whole can of diced tomatoes with chiles instaed of the half can suggested, and added tortilla chips and sour cream as a garnishment instead of the strips during cooking. It tasted like it was from a restaurant, amazing!

Hands down the best soup I have ever made! I used 2 cups of vegetable broth instead of a bouillon cube/water and it was honestly the best thing I have ever tasted! My husband (who isn't vegetarian) LOVED it! We will be making it more often for SURE! I also added a diced onion and it was great!

I used vegetable broth instead of water and boullion.  And I used soy curls as my chicken substitute.  This was quite good, and VERY easy.

Super delicious and easy to make.  I used a can of mixed beans (pinto, kidny, and black.) I topped each bowl of soup with a little shredded cheese and diced avacodo. My family loved it!

This was yummy.  I recently went vegetarian and this is a good addition to my new recipe book.  The only thing I would do is strengthen the spice - I like things a bit hotter...

i make a lot of quick soups and i really love the enchilada sauce for the base for the recipe, but that is the best part.  i doubled up on most of the seasonings and used real chicken, but there just wasn't enough to the soup.  i may reuse the recipe as a base in the future, but add much more stuff to it to achieve the texture and flavor i like.

This was super easy and yummy. The reviews that said the soup tastes better the next day are completely right. Good the 1st day and great the next day. I did add a dash of cinnamon, a little extra garlic, cumin, and chili powder. I will for sure make this again!

Delicious! Used black bean, broth instead of the bullion and water, and tortilla chips just because that's all I had. Will be a regular menu item.

Super fast "meatarian" variation: put everything in the pot; add 3 frozen chicken tenders (for 4 servings) in place of chicken substitute; let it all cook on low for an hour.

Love it, love it, love it! To add spicyness I add a can of tomatoes with diced chiles. I also add a can of hominy to make it as close to menudo as a vegetarian can.

This is a VERY VERY good soup!  Now, I kind of messed up the vegetarian part of it by adding a couple of diced up chicken breasts.  I cooked that first in the pot and then added everything else as directed.  I used black beans instead pinto since that's what I had on hand and when it was all done I added a little diced up avocado and a bit of fresh lime juice...YUMMY!! I'll definately do this again and double the recipe next time!

This was amazing! I couldn't find green enchilada sauce so I used some homemade red sauce I had in my freezer. I substituted black beans for the pinto beans, as I prefer them. I also used the entire can of diced tomatoes and doubled the chili powder. I used Yves Chick'n tenders for the meat substitute. I like my food spicy so I added some hot sauce and crushed red pepper to my bowl...I was sweating by the time I was done but man was it good!

I really enjoyed this.  The night I made it though, I didn't think it was that good. It reminded me of a chain restuarants tortilla soup (not a compliment, lol!)  Two days later, I heated the leftover for lunch, and I couldn't get enough!!  It was so good.  This recipe is almost too easy to make, too.  I thought the tortillas in there would be wierd, but I liked them.  I'll most likely make this again!

I was very pleasantly surprised when I tried this.  Very good and so easy!  I did add the whole can of tomatoes by mistake, but think I'll always do that.  I also added a can of black beans along with the pinto, no veggie chicken and I added extra cilantro, a little extra chili powder and cumin. I bet this soup is very easy to suit to your individual taste.

This is a fantastic recipe. Instead of the green enchilada sauce I used Mexican Red Sauce from my Moosewood Cookbook. Added Quorn tenders chicken substitute, which has a very chicken-like texture, soaks up the flavor well. Easy, tasty, great!

This soup is delicious! I have been a vegetarian for 25 years and this is my favorite soup--but, my non-vegetarian husband LOVES it as well. I always add the whole can of tomatoes and don't leave out the veggie "chicken". Morningstar Farms has a very good one--even if you don't like meat substitutes, I bet you will like this one. Serve this with corn muffins and you have a warm and hearty meal. Enjoy!

This is my favorite soup ever!  I put sour cream in it and I used red enchilada sauce instead of the green.  I also added a little extra kick by adding 2 tablespoons of extra hot hot sauce.  I also added olives and some other misc. things.  It's a recipe easy to change to your personal taste.  Definetly need to try it!  Such a good vegetarian meal!

What a great recipe!!  I'm sure it's great the way it's written, but I changed it a smidge for my liking.  Used a sauteed onion & added a diced red pepper.  Used black beans instead of pinto (more antioxidants, supposedly) And used a 28 ounce can of green enchilada sauce & a can of veggie broth.  Also, I did add the veggie Chicken, but sauteed that a few minutes before adding (I didn't know if it was supposed to go in "raw" or "cooked".)  Anyway, can't wait to have it again tonight & tell my sister about it.  (also a Veggie)

This ws very good, and very easy to make, I didn't use frozen corn, and I couldn't get enchilada sauce, so I used taco sauce, and it still turned out really great! I also couldn't find pinto beans and used kidney beans, neither could find mock chicken, but used veggie crumbles. Even with all the changes, it still turned out good!

We have loved this recipe and have made it on a weekly basis since trying it a few weeks ago!  We also used red enchilada sauce since we could not find green that was vegetarian and used black soy beans as the beans.  Also, we used veggie crumbles instead of the veggie chicken and sauteed that with an onion before adding the corn and beans.  Also, we left out the tortilla and topped it with shredded cheese.  Delicious and super simple recipe!  Thanks!

This was delicious and very easy!  I used much more vegetarian broth (canned or from a carton) to make it more like a soup.  Kids and non-vegetarian husband all loved it.  Definitely a keeper!

Surprising how good this is.  Skipped the Cilantro. Chopped avocado on top was so good. I threw the tomatoes in the mini-chopper to make the consistency thicker and smoother.  Added different kinds of peppers, onion and garlic.  Used broth, and chose every low sodium option that I could.  Even better the next day!

The basic recipe did not have enough vegetables for me.  So.  I added some things: One; Yellow Squash, Zucchini Squash, diced Yellow  Pepper, and one Yukon Gold Potato.  Next time I will also add Fresh Green Beans.

I sautéd al of the above in a  Cast Iron Skillet heating the Enchilada sauce and spices separately.  When everything was added I simmered all ingredients for several hours to allow the flavors to blend.

When serving I added the Tortilla strips and half of a small avocado.  YUM!

Next time I will try my instant pot Sautéing all of the vegetables in it and  adding the Enchillada Sauce, et al in a pressure setting for 4-5 minutes.

I made the recipe as written.  My husband and I both enjoyed it very much.  We ate it with a few crunchy tortilla chips.  I wasn't sure at all how it was going to turn out when I was putting in the tortillas strips while cooking, but they were very good.  We did as suggested by the recipe submitter and added the green onion, sour cream,  and cheese.  Very yummy delicious meal with very little effort.

The only thing we could taste was the enchilada sauce. My children were very excited as they love enchiladas, but the sauce is too strong and there is not enough of other flavors to balance it out. We won't be making this again.

So easy to make and fast too! Everyone loves it and I always have to make extra. I pair it with fajitas or nacho bar. I use "queso blanco" -white mexican cheese as topping and regular tostitos or whatever corn chips I have broken up instead of the corn strips. However it is way better when you fry your own tortilla strips.

Although, I sort of get it, I'm always surprised when people change a vegetarian dish into a meat eaters dish.  Great products I use to keep it vegetarian--Agustin Farms Chicken and  Better Than Boullion Chicken (1-2 teaspoons, it is salty).  It turned out great with these products.  I only used a cup of the faux chicken and did not add salt.  I went with one reviewer's recommendation of topping with cheese, sour cream, and green onions.

Excellent recipe. My family really enjoyed this on a cold and rainy day. Just a couple comments:

- I used a vegetable broth (Trader Joe's) in place of the water and bullion.
- I threw a few whole dried red chiles into the boil instead of using the chili powder.
- Next time I would put the cut tortilla pieces into the pot for only about two minutes and then serve. I left them in for a bit too long and they started to break apart.
- Finally, I topped the bowls off with sliced avocados and a dollop of sour cream.

Good stuff!

I like this recipe.  I sauteed minced garlic cloves and diced onion before I added the broth. I also used diced tomatoes with green chilies added to give it more of a Mexican flavor. Also, if you add tortilla strips, it will be good right away, but the next day the strips will have dissolved making  a thick, goopy, tortilla flavored stock.  I scratched the tortilla strips and just added a handful of tortilla chips to my bowl of soup right before eating as well as a bit of grated cheddar and a small scoop of sour cream, yummy.

We loved it! 
Doubled the recipe, cut up canned whole green chilies, added kidney beans too, lemon juice, a ton of fresh cilantro, extra frozen corn, used Better Than Bouillon Vegetable instead of a bouillon cube, added dehydrated onions, (next time throwing in fresh diced onions and garlic). Browned & spiced the chx substitute using Quorn Chik'n Tenders & then added. Pan toasted fresh cut-up tortillas in a  small amount of avocado oil, topped with homemade guacamole.

I was a tad skeptic with this one. The idea of deluded enchilada sauce, didn't sound promising. I couldn't have been more wrong in my assumptions.  This was Wonderful!! 
I didn't have enough green sauce, so I used half green and half red.  Substituted black beans for the meat product.  I DID use both black and pinto. I also threw in a can of green chilis because of the half red sauce.  After I plated I sprinkle some monterey jack on top.  So so so good and super fast to throw together.

Absolutely loved this recipe! I did make some changes though. I used broth instead of water and added onions (about 1/2 a cup) and used the whole can of tomatoes. Then at the very end I added avocado slices with the sour cream, cilantro and cheese. So good! Also, this soup was much better after it sat for a while. I made it around 10 am, let it sit on the burner until the onions were completely cooked (about 20 mins) then put it in the fridge until dinner (around 7pm). The flavors need some time to blend together.

Didn't pay attention to the ingredients and got red enchilada sauce instead of green. Made the soup spicy but the sour cream & cheese I topped it with brought the soup's heat level to normal. Delicious! Will definitely make again.

Yummy! I thought the tortilla strips might be too mushy so I baked them for 10 minutes at 375° before I added them, and the stew came out excellent! Great recipe, I'll definitely make this again!

I had to use red enchilada sauce since I couldn't find the green. Added extra chili powder and cumin, and added a couple packets of cilanto-tomato sazon goya seasoning since I forgot to buy cilatro. Black beans instead of pinto, and crumbled tortilla chips. Restaurant quality right here!

Very tasty as is (which is exceedingly rare on all recipes).  The only things I did differently were based on either necessity or cost.  First in my (Southern California) grocery stores there is no such thing as a 19 oz can of enchilada sauce, it's either 10oz or 28oz so I got the 28 as it was a better deal and adjusted the spices accordingly, meaning a bit more of everything and added the full can of tomatoes.  The other change was that I used fresh corn as it was cheaper than frozen, and tasted significantly better for only a little extra effort.

DELICIOUS! I made a few changes to the recipe. I used fire-roasted diced tomatoes, canned corn instead of frozen, and substituted black beans for the pinto beans. Also, sauteed some onions & bell peppers before adding the enchilada sauce and vegetable broth (instead of the bouillon cube). Omitted the veg chicken (can't stand fake meat products), and didn't use tortillas. Garnished with crumbled up tortilla chips, light sour cream & lots of cilantro. The carnivorous boyfriend loved it. Will definitely make again (and again, and again...)

Very tasty. I thought it could use with a bit more heft, though, so I swapped the vegetal bouillon for beef bouillon and gave it a bit more flavor. 

Obviously this makes the dish non-vegetarian but if you are like me, eating vegetarian solely for health purposes, you will like this change as you still get all of the veggie goodness just with a touch more flavor.

Amazing! My sister's boyfriend who practically refuses to eat anything without meat said it was the best soup he's ever tried.. So that says a lot! It was super easy and I will be making it again very soon, went super fast so didn't even get a chance for left overs.

I LOVE THIS SOUP!!! So so sooo good!!! It was extremely easy to make too! I used a 10 oz can of enchilada sauce and the taste was wonderful not too over powering but still packed a punch. I also added the crushed red pepper flakes, 2 cloves fresh garlic, and regular vegetable broth as suggested by other reviewers and it was great!

I made this with red (mild) enchilada sauce since I couldn’t find green, and it was much too spicy for my taste! Still a very good dish, but I’d cut down an ounce or two on the enchilada sauce to increase the health value a little – and next time, I’ll definitely use green sauce, or else have some sour cream on hand to steal some of the bite!

Pretty darn good!  I tweaked it just a little - started out by sauteing a little bit of onion and 3 cloves of garlic (instead of the garlic powder) in olive oil, then followed the bulk of the recipe as stated.  I had no pinto beans so used small kidney beans, and I added a whole can of tomatoes, as well as half a tiny can of green chilis (because my enchilada can was only 14 oz. instead of 19).  Really good flavor!

This was delicious!  We all ate it up at my house.  It was very spicy, probably because I added chiles.  I didn't put any meat substitute in it.  I also didn't rinse the beans.  I think next time I will use 2 cans of beans.  Also, I didn't have any bullion so I used one envelope of Lipton Savory Veggie Soup mix.

I did not make a vegetarian version.  I doubled the recipe for my family and used red enchilada sauce with the green enchilada sauce to make up the difference in what I had in my pantry.  I used chicken broth instead of the vegetable bouillon and real chicken.  I added a can of refried beans to help thicken it.  Also, I did not put the tortillas in the stew.  Instead, I fried tortilla strips in canola oil and we topped our stew with them to add a crunchy texture.  Very good!

This is a wonderful meal! I added some left over rice and garnished with diced avocados and shredded mozzarella cheese, along with the fried tortilla strips. 
DELISOUS! ~Courtney

This is an easy, quick and tasty recipe!  I did sub a few things - I used vegetable broth instead of the bullion; I added a can of black beans and omitted the fake chicken.  Serve it with cheese, sour cream and green onions!  Yummy!  Will definitely be making this again, and again...

This was TERRIFIC!  I wasn't too excited about it before making it, but I thought I would try it since the reviews were good and it looked easy. The soup turned out to be great, and I will definitely make it again!

Modifications:
-Browned cubes of extra firm tofu (I used a little of the enchilada sauce instead of oil)
-15 oz. black beans
-Entire can of tomatoes (I got diced tomatoes with green peppers and onions)
-Can of refried beans to thicken the soup

I thought that the tortillas would be weird in soup, but they were actually really good. 

This is a thick, delicious soup. Great for vegetarians!  I highly recommend it :-)

This was super good.  I like my soup to be more chunky, so I added the full can of tomatoes, a can of black beans in addition to the pinto beans, and omitted the corn.

It was really, really good.

Very yummy and super easy. I didn't do the chicken substitute and made my own beans (another recipe from the site) the second time around. We added some sour cream and cheese on top. This definitely has made it into the family cookbook and will be made over and over again.

I have made this twice, and it was yummy both times.  I used black beans instead of pinto beans and red enchilada sauce as I could not find green.  I have used flour tortillas instead of corn due to personal preference, and I don't put the tortilla in until I'm ready to eat it.  Super yummy, and it's a great veggie meal to add to our regular rotation of dinners!

Used red enchilada sauce because it was cheaper and spicier. Ate out of bread bowls but would also be good with some frence bread chunks stirred in. Awesome recipe, will definitely make again.
