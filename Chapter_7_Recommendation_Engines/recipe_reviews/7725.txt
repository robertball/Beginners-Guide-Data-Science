Simple sweet sauce. I used it over the Jamaica Cake recipe listed on this site also. Never had such rave reviews from family over such simple recipes. Highly recommend both.

This tastes exactly like you would expect it to. It tastes like sweetened melted butter that has been thickened. Tastes delicious. I love to experiment with new pound cakes and this is going to be perfect to save the less than perfect new tries. Also this is the type of sauce that will soak into whatever you put it on top of. Thanks!
