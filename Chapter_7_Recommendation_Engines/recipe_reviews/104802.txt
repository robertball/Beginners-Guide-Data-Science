I loved this recipe although I did make a few changes, I used 2 lbs of fresh oysters and added a 1/2 lb of bacon (chopped and fried crispy) I double the sauce and used Heavy Whipping cream instead of milk. 8 oz of mushrooms and a red onion chopped.  This is wonderful chowder!! Thanks

I grew up with oyster stew that was simply milk, butter and oysters... and is still a favorite.  This is a new dimension... very tasty, very different but still showcasing the oyster flavor.  I did as another reviewer suggested and added bacon (diced and crisply cooked).  I also added a bit of salt and about a teaspoon of habanero sauce.  Wonderful!

Excellent recipe!  I used some 1/2 & 1/2 to make a little creamier and used Paula Deens house seasoning. This one's a keeper.

This was a really simple soup to make. Half way through cooking, I realized I had a can of clams instead of oysters but used it anyways. Still turned out great! I will try it with oysters next time.

Use some Extra Sharp White Cheddar and Real Cream YUM! (the x-sharp white melts like silk no clumping) No its not for the weight watcher but if your cooking for company GO FOR THE FLAVOR! Need spice? try Old Bay Seasoning and say YES to the Bacon - yeah its a heart stopper but for those who are the weight watchers just don't eat a lot and exercise an extra 10 minutes the next day. ENJOY. Thank you Raoulysgirl for the recipe.

Excellent! Being a clam lover, I am not too fond of oysters but this was terrific. I will make this again. I may try it with clams the next time. Just a personal preference. They are "meatier." A great recipe/

Excellent. Don't be afraid to try it. It sounds crazy putting spinach with oyster stew but it was awesome. My husband grew up with fresh oyster stew and he is 65 now and loves the stuff.  He had only had oyster stew with milk, butter and oysters. This is a really nice twist to oyster stew which he requests often. We always use fresh/frozen oysters, never canned with this. I shred my spinach leaves a little so you don't get such a big piece of spinach and we also like a tsp. of Old Bay in the chowder. We sometimes add salad shrimp in this which is really nice.   It even reheats which is a plus as there are only two of us so we at least have a couple meals.

I made this for my husband for New Year's Day with fresh oysters he shucked..... he hasn't stopped talking about it..... It was awesome... I added the precooked bacon chopped up when I added the cheese.... and used 4 cups of whole milk and one cup of half and half. Incredible texture, taste and color... I would love to try it with fresh clams... thank you for the recipe

Used skim milk, 4 celery ribs, 1 teaspoon worcetershire sauce, 4 garlic cloves, and 1/2 stick of butter (very slight changes).  1-10 rating- I give it a 25.

A good recipe base that needs some extra touches to bring it from blah to great.  Next time, I'll try bacon,Old Bay or something--anything--to give it a little more flavor.

I used canned smoked oysters, double mushrooms, and extra nonfat milk powder for thickening. We had arugula, so I used that with stems removed and leaves cut in half. Added some black pepper, roasted garlic, and mesquite spice blend. I melted in crumbled sharp cheddar and a few slices of provolone and DH LOVED it! I don't adore oysters, but this was pretty darn good with a crusty roll.

This chowder was delicious! I followed the recipe exact. My husband always compares any kind of oyster soup to his mother's dish, but he said I liked this just as much if not more! Thanks for sharing this recipe! Yummy!

I love soup and this one ain’t bad. Didn’t have all amounts that I needed but had all the ingredients and improvised and it turned out great so my rating is based on what I did not the recipe itself.

A little heavy cream always enhances.

I follwed the basic recipe but added chopped crisp bacon,  a tsp of Old Bay seasoning and some hot sauce. I used fresh Pacific oysters instead of canned. So richly flavoured! Will definitely make this again

I used half and half instead of just milk, added a quarter teaspoon of garlic powder, and mixed the flour with butter rather than milk.

I used smoked oysters, added a couple diced redskin potatoes and almost doubled the sharp cheddar. Definitely needed salt and pepper to taste. Serving with Cheddar Bay biscuits :) OB said slightly anemic so oysters and spinach should do the trick!

Smoked oysters gave a lovely smokey flavour to the soup.  I added the old bay seasoning and salt pork and that's it.  Really good.

Rich and fantastic. Used leftover oysters from steaming a bushel the other night. Even without the oyster sauce, I chopped a couple of them up to add to the soup and it came out flavorful and delicious!

My husband loves oysters and he looooved this chowder.  I am not such a huge oyster fan and this was very edible.  Definitely get a lot of the oyster flavor in it.
