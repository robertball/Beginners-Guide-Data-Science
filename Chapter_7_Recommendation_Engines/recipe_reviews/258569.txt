The list of ingredients in this recipe caught my attention with avocado, tomato and poached egg however I would have never thought of pairing corned beef hash with black beans. Pure genius. The black beans give the hash a whole new element of flavor.

What a great way to utilize corned beef hash. I did add some hot picante sauce to the mixture for some heat but that is the only change I made. I overcooked my egg (user error) but it still turned out good. Great recipe and a unique spin on your every day typical hash. Think South of the border breakfast...brunch...lunch..or even dinner.  It works for all of them. Thanks for the great recipe Buckwheat Queen!
