My husband and I were at a senior dinner last night at our church and this was the desert... May I say that it was the very best desert I've had in a long time, and we have desert with our meals daily. I asked what this was and was told to go on ALL Recipes and look up Tiramisu Cups, and here I am ready to make them for tonight's desert.

Does anyone know if these stay solid after they are made if they are kept in the refrigerator? The recipe isn't specific about that or the whipped cream. Is it  added just before serving and did they use actual whipped cream or that other stuff?
