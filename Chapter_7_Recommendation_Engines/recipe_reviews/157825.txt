This is quite possibly the worst "bean" recipe I have ever used.  1/2 cup of brown sugar combined with 1/4 tsp of cayenne is a terrible combination.  I should have known better but was looking for a no brainer and saw the reviews where people had not changed this recipe and enjoyed it.

I was really excited about this recipe because its quick to assemble and totally easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly  except i subbed kielbasa sausage for the ham because i didnt have ham. Unfortunately, the broth is  REALLY sweet- so if you like sweet ham and beans (we dont) then this might be the recipe for you. If not, i would leave out the brown sugar or at least cut it WAY back.

I had some left over ham from the holidays that I pulled out of the freezer and thawed out.  Chopped it up, tossed the ingredients for this recipe into my crock pot, and ended up with a very tasty soup!  

The only change that I made is that I added a can of chicken broth, then added water 2" to cover.

I'll be serving this with a plate of cornbread, and a cool spinach salad.

This recipe has a quick prep time, and tastes great!  I'll be making this again!

I followed most of the instructions for this recipe but about half way through cooking I added fresh greenbeans, carrots, celery, and an onion to the soup. It turned out great and my boyfriend loved it. We ate it with cornbread and fresh watermelon.

They were easy to make and with lots of flavor! Although the recipe calls to cook on low for 12 hours, I found that not to be true with my cooker.  Therefore, I would say cook time ranges from 3-12 hours. In addition to the onion powder, I added lima beans, chopped onions and two smoked ham hocks.  If you have company for a couple of days, this is a wonderful recipe. Serve it with the cornbread muffins II—family and guest will love it!  Also, this freezes well!

I never look at a recipe that is less then a 4 1/2 star but I looked at the ingredients and thought, YUM.  So I looked at the reviews.  The negative ones made me try it.  First of all, I kinda doubt the person actually made this recipe who thought the b.sugar and cayenne pepper was a terrible idea.  Secondly, if you think about this recipe truly it is an awesome base.  I have made many of bean soups.  My husband said this one was one of my better soups, and he loves my cooking.  I used an onion instead of onion powder.  This was all I did to the "base"recipe yet I know what I love in a bean recipe.   I added celery. with about an hour to cook I added on can kernel corn and 1 can stewed tomatoes. Served with buttermilk biscuits.  Remember the sugar does change the flavor and it for the better... it give it a rich deep flavor.  Not too sweet at all.  Then of course I added other veggies.  Thank you for this great "base" recipe and if I wanted a thick bean and ham... I would leave it alone and add a lot less water.

Very delicious, I enjoyed it. My family also gave it a thumbs up.  I made it exactly as the recipe was written and next time I think I will try using a little less brown sugar.

This was really good.  I used smoked turkey sausage instead of ham and 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup...I think next time I will increase the brown sugar a little, although not to the full 1/2 cup.  Served this with some cornbread and it was a great down-home meal!

This is a good bean recipe, I serve beans with many meals. Being from south Louisiana where we eat rice and gravy alot, beans go well with most meals. I tweeked it a bit. I added chicken broth cubes and ground jalapeno peppers. I left out the brown sugar which makes this recipe healthier. This recipe freezes well so I doubled it. I will make this again.

Made this without the brown sugar as others suggested it was too sweet.  I also just love the flavor of the beans and the ham so the only thing I added was pepper....beans, ham, water, pepper.  Then add a Tbsp of sugar to your boxed cornbread mix and that give you the sweet you need.

This is by far one of the most flavorful bean recipes I've discovered.  I liked the contrast between the brown sugar and the onion/garlic/cayenne combination; it made them "sweet 'n spicy".  It came out more like a soup than what I expected, but that was fine; I just served it with saltines and we were set to go!  I have a 6-quart crockpot, so I doubled the ingredients.  There will be plenty for tasty leftovers tomorrow.  I used turkey ham, and added two cans of chicken broth before covering with water.  I also converted the cooking time to 8 hours on high, since I'm not an early enough riser to have everything prepared by 6 a.m.!  LOL  Cooking on High, as far as I can tell, works just as well.  One last thing, next time I might try adding some chopped onion, celery, and/or carrots.

We made this recipe from a bone left from our Christmas honey ham.  I dropped the sugar in half as others suggested, and used half Northern and half navy beans.  Otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter.  Just before eating, I used a potato masher to smash some of the beans to thicken it up.  Served with warm cornbread.  Yummy!

I LOVE this soup and I LOVE how easy it is to get ready!  I think the sweet and spicy mixture that the brown sugar and cayenne pepper create is awesome.  Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!  It's one that I can always count on to be stress free, but yummy!

This was my first time making Ham and Beans and I LOVED it!  Followed recipe as directed except I cut the cayenne pepper in half, and I used 15 Bean Soup, since that is all I had on hand.  At first I followed other reviews by cutting the brown sugar in half, but when I tasted the beans at the end, I ended up adding more brown sugar - which totalled to the recommended amount.  I also used 2 cans Chicken Broth and then filled the rest of the way with water to cover the beans, and I think that helped with flavoring.  I also used a tip that I read on another ham and bean recipe...." Add a pinch (maybe 1/2 tsp) of baking soda - makes the beans creamy and much less gassy".   
I loved that I could throw it in the crockpot and it was ready when I got home.  Will be making this again!

I really didn't even want to give this one star, but did only because it was edible, just not palatable.  My husband and I both did not finish one bowl of this and I am deleting from my recipe box.  I think there was far too much brown sugar, it was way too sweet with no other flavor really.  I even added more of each ingredient to try and make it taste better, with no luck.  I am going to refrigerate it until tomorrow and taste again. Maybe it will be better the second day.  I'm glad I made the cheddar biscuits that I did!

My family loves these beans! I will add some leftover bacon and pork chops to this mixture, chopped onion, put it all in the slow cooker for about 6 hours checking the water as you go. About 30 min before your ready to eat crack the lid and it will thicken just enough :)  Bake cornbread with honey to go along with it. We will definitely be making this often this winter. Thanks for sharing this!

We just finished eating.  This recipe was great.  My husband had been wanting some home made beans since it had been a while since I made some.  We really enjoyed this recipe.  The only thing I did differently was I chopped up a small onion and added that to it and only half the onion powder and used less brown sugar after reading the reviews..  My three children and husband were pleased.  Thanks!

Loved Loved Loved this recipe!!!!...everyone that ate it enjoyed it. I made this for a cookout instead of the traditional baked beans and everyone commented that it was even better then bush's. I did add bacon instead of the ham and it turned out great. Had a delicious sweet yet smokey flavor.

My husband just told me that this is by far the best Ham Hock & Bean soup he's ever had, and he has eaten a lot of different ones. I used the base, but didn't have onion powder so used a med onion, and also I put a little too much water in so I made the best of it and added flour & water to make it creamy. I also did a rapid soak for the beans and cooked it on high for 5 hrs then kicked it down to low. I served it with rolls, my kids broke up the rolls and dropped them in to make it like dumplings. It was a huge hit in my household. Thanks for your recipie!!!

I used the beans for 15 bean soup.  My husband thought the recipe was a little bland, but I think it will be better when we eat it for leftovers.  Easy recipe.

Great & easy recipe!  I deviated somewhat from the basic recipe after reading reviews and using what I had on hand.  My wife had bought some ground ham in the deli, so I used a 1/2 Lbs. of that.  I had a bag of 15 beans and soaked them overnight (did NOT use the flavor packet with it).  I started with a 28oz can of diced tomatoes, 1 chopped medium onion, about a half cup each of chopped green and red pepper (frozen from bags in the freezer), 2 tsp. crushed jar garlic, brown sugar & spices as indicated.  Added the beans & homemade chicken stock instead of water I had on hand.

About 6 hours in, chopped 1 Lbs. of turkey kielbasa in half moons (less five inches that I grilled and put on a hotdog bun for lunch)& added it to crockpot.

11 hours in it was still to soupy for my taste. I skimmed out about 1 cup of liquid, cool it in fridge, then whisked in about 4 TBL of flour to the cool liquid.  Added mixture back to crockpot to thicken to light gravy type texture.  Everyone loved it - a keeper!

We both thought this was tasty, but I followed the advice of others and only used 1/4 c brown sugar, and we wouldn't have wanted it any sweeter. I also substituted part of the water with beef broth. I forgot to soak the beans overnight, so I washed the beans and set the slow cooker on high for 4-5 hours, then on low for the remainder of the time, and they were fully cooked, so you don't have to worry if you don't soak the beans first. I will make this again and will substiture turkey kielbasa when I don't have leftover ham.

I've never really cared for ham and beans but I liked this recipe. The brown sugar made it tasty instead of bland and hot. We ate it with cornbread in the dish. I used leftover pieces I had from a big ham. I didn't have time to cook it in the crock pot so I used a jar of beans and did it on the stove top and it worked fine. It was good winter comfort food.

Best ham and beans ever. The entire family liked it. The slow cooker method made very simple to do. I would not change a thing to the recipe. One thing we did do was add a ham bone that we had saved for this type of recipe.

I omit the brown sugar, because I pick up a ham bone at the Honey Baked Ham Store for a few bucks. They trim the spiral sliced meat off the bones for sandwiches and to sell in smaller quantities than a whole ham. There is still a large amount of ham on the bone that didn't get used for those purposes: perfect for a batch of beans or pea soup.

I live alone and this recipe is perfect for portioning into zip freezer bags for a quick warm-me-up in the winter. Awesome with PBJ sandwiches.

Used Old Bay instead of salt and a garlic pepper blend. Also added some liquid smoke. Was very good!

It's even better with a half cup of white vinegar and a couple of sliced Jalapinos thrown on top.  I would leave out the cayenne pepper tho.  I always save the bones from my spiral sliced ham and throw that in.  After 10 hours the bones are totally bare of meat.

Really good! I loved the brown sugar with the beans - just a little sweet but not too much. This is the best ham and beans recipe I've tried. Very easy too - not a lot of chopping, just throw it in the pot before you go to work! Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought this was wonderful!! I did take some of the reviewers advice and cut down the amout of brown sugar however. I used 2tbs. instead and it was perfect. I also sauteed the onions a bit before dropping them in the crock pot.It was so good! My husband said it was the best ham and beans he has ever eaten.

Wow! This recipe is awesome!  I did follow the suggestions to cut down on the brown sugar, so I put in about 1/4 a cup.  It was perfect.  My kids ate it and asked for more.  This recipe alone is reason enough to make a ham dinner...to be able to use the leftovers for this!  Thank you for the recipe!

Hmm.... I'm not sure why nearly every review suggests this is too sweet (huh?). Not only is this not sweet at all, it is neither savory OR spicy. Because I made this for myself, I fully anticipated LOTS of leftovers. My hubby is returning from his business trip late tonight and will probably grab something at the airport. He doesn't care for beans anyways, so my plan was to eat this for the next few day's lunches. I'm sad to say that I'm not going to.... This is SUPER bland! Now, I'll admit, I snubbed my nose at ham and beans as a child (my mom LOOOVED them and fixed them often for her and my father), but I am happy to report, I have made it past my childhood aversion. Unfortunately, this recipe failed to convince me how good ham and beans can be. :( Tonight's meal ended up consisting primarily 
of cornbread and a half bowl of beans I was able to choke down. Thanks anyways, PeaceLoveJoy.

My family loved this recipe. I did make some changes. First I used Black Eyed Peas instead of the northern beans, second I used chopped onions instread of onion powder and last I used red pepper instead of cayenne pepper! It was wonderful and we served it over corn bread!

This turned out great. I used pinto beans but I didn't soak them just washed, sorted, and started cooking. I also used the whole slice of ham (bone-in kind, uncooked) straight from the freezer. I had to make this on the stovetop as I knocked the crock pot off the countertop with my elbow and it fell in slow motion all the way to the floor. My husband enjoyed this very very much but the next time I make this, I'll use less cayenne and take almost all the brown sugar out. Thanks, hubby is pleased and he packed up the leftovers to take to work tomorrow.

Fantastic recipe. I did not have Great Northern Beans on hand, but did have a bag of Navy beans. They worked great. I wanted to have it slightly thickened, so when it was done cooking I grabbed a couple ladles of the beans and broth portion and pureed them in the blender. I stirred it back in with the beans and it was perfect!  Both teenage kids loved it. My husband, who really can't stand beans or bean soups told me this needs to go into our cold-months dinner rotation. I was hesitant to make it at first because of some reviews calling it too sweet. It had a hint of sweetness, but wasn't overly so at all.  I made it a week and a half ago, and am soaking beans right now to prepare it for dinner tomorrow night. Thanks for an amazing recipe!

Very Good ! Here are my changes..... I doubled the recipe and also added 3 bay leaves ... minced garlic, 3 stalks of celery chopped, 3 yellow onions roughly diced, 1 large green pepper cut into smaller chunks and half of lb of baby carrots cut up and maybe a t of cayenne pepper and same amount of Cajun seasoning and fresh ground black pepper to taste. 
Added the carrots and celery about halfway in .
Cooked for 1st 2 hours on high then 9+ or so on low .
To get to the consistency I like added flour to thicken it at the end.

I did make some subs.  First of all, I decided to make this this morning, so no overnight soak.  I did an all day cook on high instead.  It worked.  I used an Onion Soup mix packet for the Onion powder, it worked.  Subbed minced garlic for the garlic salt.  Figured it had enough salt from the onion soup mix. Finally after hearing here about it being too sweet, I cut the sugar in half.  The ham bone  + Ham was from a frozen spiral cut where I saved the bone at Thanksgiving.   All these minor tweaks came together very nicely.

I had never attempted ham and beans in the slow cooker and really wanted to try it. I'm so glad I did! I didn't think my family would enjoy the sugar, as we have always eaten savory ham and beans, so I soaked my beans overnight, drained and rinsed, and added to the slow cooker the next day with a diced onion, one smoked ham hock, 3 minced garlic cloves, salt, white pepper, two chicken bullion cubes and added water two inches above the beans as instructed. The only issue I had was after 9 hours of cook time, I had an incredible amount of liquid! Our personal preference is for a thicker, stew-like consistency, so I will cut back on the water next time. Other than that, FABULOUS recipe! By doing in the slow cooker, I can serve this on a weeknight. Thank you for sharing!

I love this recipe. The first time I made a double batch and took some to my in-laws. The next day my father in law called to tell me it was the best he's ever had. Let me tell ya, he doesn't hand out compliments like that but once in a blue moon, so he must've really liked it. It's perfect with corn bread or my hubs eats it with saltines. I make it once a week or every other week in the winter.

Had some leftover spiral cut honey glazed ham and the ham hock so gave this one a go.  It was very flavorful and easy.  I cut back on the brown sugar since I already had the honey glaze going on.  I will probably cut it in half the next time I make it.  Started with about 2 cups of chicken stock for the liquid and then added water on top of that.  Also added a cup of freshly diced onions.  Great recipe!

It was so bland we're having a hard time finishing it. Two stars only because 12 hours was the right amount of time to cook the beans, they're soft but not mushy.

The only changes I made was to reduce the brown sugar to 2 Tablespoons and ad a dash of onion owder and worcestershire sauce.  Taste was very good but am giving it only four stars because the beans were too mushy for our taste.  Will reduce the cooking time to about 8 hours next time.

Super easy family meal!! I used 1 lb quality ham,1 chopped onion, and cut back on the sugar to 1 T. With the remaining ingredients, I followed the written recipe.  I don't think my family would have enjoyed these beans if I had used 1/2 brown sugar.

This recipe was pretty good.  I make it almost exactly as stated.  The changes I did make: I only used 1/3 c. of brown sugar and would probably even decrease that to only 1/4 c. next time, I used minced garlic instead of garlic salt, and I used a 1 1/2 pound package of Farmland smoked spiral ham slices and pieces.  Probably only got a little over a pound once I cut out the "grissly" parts, but just 1/2 pound definitely would not have been enough ham for a full pound of beans!  I liked this well enough and wouldn't say I was disappointed with the outcome, but probably will try a different recipe next time!

This recipe is awesome! My Mom always made ham and beans growing up and this blows hers out of the water. I farwarded it on to her and from now on I think we will both be using this one. By the way...I made it on the stove, not in the slow cooker.

Do not forget to soak those beans!   I reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup.  Set slow cooker on HIGH for 5 hours and LOW for 2 hours.  Perfect!  The cayenne gives a little 'sumthin to the taste. YUM!

Quick and easy with good flavor. Used 2 cans of beans for shortcut. Would add much less brown sugar next time. I like the sweet spicy mix but sugar was a tad too much. Still very edible tho!  Will do again.

Very good indeed! My man wanted ham and beans rather than bean soup, and I hadn’t made it before or even eaten it, so I was pleased to find this recipe. I heeded all the advice to cut the brown sugar, then kept adding more till I suspect I put in about the amount in the recipe . I guess I like sweeter beans than most here! I also used broth rather than water and upped the amount of cayenne a little, but that’s just a personal preference thing. Thanks for a really tasty recipe!

This is a favorite recipe of my family. I think Ham and Beans should be savory and not sweet so I do not use the brown sugar. The cayenne pepper is perfect. It gives it a little bit of nip without being too hot and spicy.

It was tasty, and had a nice bit of heat in the aftertaste, but it was sweeter than I was expecting. Next time I'll use less sugar.

I grew up eating ham and beans. This recipe is very easy! I did make a few adjustments. I didn't use the brown sugar. I also left out the cayenne and onion powder. I used 1/2 tsp salt and increased the garlic powder to a full tsp. I also used the ham bone from my leftover Thanksgiving ham and the cubed meat that was left on the bone.. all in all about a pound of ham or more. I also substituted pinto beans for great northern beans.  I am  very happy with the way this turned out and will definitely make this again when I have leftover ham!

This was so delicious I couldn't stop eating it. Only change was I only used 1/4 cup brown sugar even though I doubled the recipe so I could share with my neighbors and 1/8 tsp cayenne for the double batch. I will definitely be making this again and again!!

This was really good and very simple to prepare. No need to soak the beans.  The cook time left the beans a little mushy.  I wouldn't add brown sugar in the future as the ham is sweet enough.

After we added enough salt, pepper, and hot sauce at the table, this was just okay. Before that? This was...beans in hot sugar water.  Probably not making this again; there are better slow cooker bean recipes out there.

I made two changes.  First, I used pinto beans because that's what I had available. Second, I added 1/2 tsp. of liquid smoke.  everything else was the same as the recipe instructions.  We did not find them too sweet.  I normally leave jalapeños, cayenne, Tabasco,  etc. out because neither my husband or I care for hot spicey food.  This recipe had just the right amount of heat.  Awesome recipe and I will definitely be making this again!

Forgot to prep dry beans overnight so I improvised with 2 cans of Great Northern Beans. We don't like spicy food so I left out the cayenne, which definitely left a more sweet flavor - not overwhelming but I will cut down on the sugar a little next time.. I simply put everything together with about 2 cups of water and let it simmer for  about an hour, then used an immersion blender to make it creamier. Will definitely make it again, and with a little less sugar I'm sure it will be 5 stars.

It's not quite like grandma made, but I absolutely loved it. I actually really liked the combination of cayenne and brown sugar that a lot have complained about, but I would probably cut the brown sugar in half next time. I used pinto beans and spiral cut ham pieces.

I will reduce the water next time - way too soupy with the amount of 2 inches above the beans. Delicious taste and the family loved it! Great with Homesteader Cornbread!

2 tablespoons sugar would have been perfect.

 I think fresh hers would make a bif difference.

This was just "okay." I made it as the recipe states, only I halved the brown sugar and cayenne pepper (SO glad I did!), and replaced the water with chicken broth to add flavor. It was not very flavorful, but the flavor it did have was odd. I didn't care for it, one of my kids that will eat almost anything took one bite and was done. I think my husband was the only one who actually finished his. I will use a different recipe the next time I make ham and beans.

I was a little nervous with that much brown sugar, but it ended up tasting great.  Even better as leftovers.  I did cubed pork loin chops instead of ham and paired it with some cornbread.

Made this tonight but after reading other reviews I did make some changes. I soaked the beans overnight. In crockpot I put 1 TB - pepper, garlic powder, onion powder; 1/2 TB cayene pepper, smoke paprika; 3 bay leaves. 1 box chicken broth. Add beans.(honestly give or take on those spices...I'm not good at measuring. I used a TB and dumped spices in using it). Ham hock. Cooked from 6:00am-4:30pm. Mashed just a bit before serving, not all of them just a couple mashes to thicken the broth. Cooked up about 8 strips of bacon and added just before serving. Family said it was the best I'd ever made! Hope these changes help others.

This is the best bean soup I have ever made and will be my go to recipe from now on. For me the brown sugar is what kicked the recipe up a notch.

I did not care for the sweet tones of this recipe.  So I made it the second time without the brown sugar.  Perfect!  This is now my go-to recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

We loved this! It's super easy & my hubby said he likes it way better than traditional ham & beans. He loved the sweet vs hot mixture. The teenage, who 'hates ham & beans', said he liked it & had 2 bowls! I used black eyed peas in place of navy beans, added a tiny bit of cumin, and use a little cilantro in place of parsley (we were out). This will likely be my go to bean recipe going forward.

I grew up in the south.  My grandmother made ham & beans frequently.  My mother followed her recipe exactly.  I always liked their ham & beans.  No complaints.

This recipe is awesome!  It is the best ham & beans I've ever tasted.  It's better than my grandma's, sorry grandma.

Also, it's absolutely unnecessary to soak the beans.  Google it.  Rinse the beans and dump them into the slow-cooker.

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly and was impressed with the outcome.  It was tasty and delicious.  The second time I made it I doubled the ham and added a whole onion diced.  OMG!  The absolutely BEST ham & beans I've ever eat.

I also added a couple of tablespoons of mustard halfway through cooking.  Something my grandmother did.

This recipe is now a permanent addition in my kitchen!

My father in law can be a very picky man. He likes his food to stay the same as how he's eaten it for the past 20 years. But he tried these beans when I made them and said they were the best he's ever had! Super easy and super flavorful!

This turned out great for us!  I used a leftover ham bone that still had lots of ham and was particularly tasty in this dish and I cooked it in the slow cooker for 8 hours which was probably at least an hour too long (but still great.)  I did not add the sugar because I already know we don't like sweet Northern beans and I added a bay leaf which I think really added to the taste.  I probably added more garlic than the recipe called for.  You can definitely taste that small amount of cayenne pepper.  We loved this dish but I think the quality of the hame bone/meat may be key to making this a great one...ours was great!  Thank you!

We used a diced red onion and two minced cloves of garlic, sauteed in a little butter with the ham, and ham stock for part of the water.  Did not find this too sweet at all.  Good beans.

Doubled the ham and used chicken broth.  We did not find it too sweet, and like the brown sugar/cayenne combination.

Its so delicious and easy. My family loved it. I only put 1/3 cup brown sugar due to other reviews. It was delicious but I will try 1/2 cup and follow the recipe next time because 1/3 wasn't even detected.

Very good.  I didn't have the onion powder so I used fresh onions.  The whole family liked it.  I'll have to double the recipe next time.

Great recipe! I had to give it a full 5 stars to counter balance the few poor ratings and reviews given by others... First off, great use for a post holiday ham bone. After slow cooking all day, any remaining meat simply melts right off the bone. Secondly, yes... It was a little sweet, but not crazy sweet, and sweetness was nicely balanced by the cayenne pepper.
I made this with a few modifications: I used sautéed onions instead of onion powder, and garlic powder + salt instead of garlic salt, added one generous tsp of dried rosemary instead of parsley, and fortified liquid by including some vegetable stock.  I thought the results were outstanding!
The next time I make this I would reduce sugar to 1/3 C, sauté celery with onions and add a few chopped carrots halfway through the cooking time.
This one is a keeper!

Good recipe made for nice base. However, I did substitute and a pinch of my own liking. I prefer bacon for the flavoring, I cooked (5) bacon pieces and used the remaining grease to saute 1 small onion, in lieu of onion powder. I added the bacon and sauteed onion (grease included). Additionally, white pepper is a nice compliment to the northern bean. While maybe not heart healthy--Southern at heart, it was absolutely delicious!

i haven't had this diah in some years, i'm the only one in my family that will touch beans especially lima,i followed the recipe to the tee & it made me very pleased. i will make this more often for sure. just the right amount of sugar also.
