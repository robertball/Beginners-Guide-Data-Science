This dish had an excellent flavor, I wanted to rate it 5 stars but it did need a little fixing.  First, I used only half cream and half milk but it was WAY too thick.  Next try I used milk and no cream and it was perfect.  I balked at the lb of mushrooms, but it's a perfect amount.  Also, just personal preference, I used half shrimp and half scallops.  Exquisite!  I would serve this for company.

I never have cream on hand, so I used 1% milk instead, and it was fine.  The cream cheese still gave it that "creamy" mouth feel. I also don't keep "cajun seasoning" on hand, so I used 1/4 tsp. each of paprika, cayenne red pepper, black pepper, onion powder, and salt.  The cayenne was really what pushed this recipe over the top - combined with the creaminess, it made a really interesting sauce.

I made this recipe for my fiance and his family.  They said it tasted like something from a restaurant.  The only alteration I made was that I used regular sized portobello mushrooms and I used 3/4 whipping cream and 1 and 1/4 cup skim milk.  It was still very rich and has a little kick. I highly recommend it!

Pretty good! And amazingly easy. But I didn't make it as written. I cooked the onions/mushrooms, then removed them, wiped out the pan (or sauce will be greyish brown), and then melted the butter and added the flour. Let it cook several minutes to cook out the flour taste,then added the garlic (extra!) and spices. Let it cook a few minutes, then melted in the cream cheese and slowly added the cream. Added the mushrooms/onions. Yum! Also~ I subbed spaghetti squash for pasta to make it a bit healthier.

OMG this was so good. It made 6 very large servings, we are 4 and we ate it for dinner one nite and then we all ate it for lunch the next day too. This was a very simple recipe and we made it just as posted except the type of pasta - i was out of fettuccini noodles. We will be making this part of our regular monthly menu.

I made this last night for my husband's birthday. I used cookie_cooker's  suggestions to melt the butter, then add the flour and cook for a couple of minutes before adding the cream cheese and cream. The only seasoning I used was Tony Chachere's (I'm from Louisiana, so it's a staple in my pantry). I used the whole pint of whipping cream, but I did have to add milk (I have 2%) to thin it a little. This was delicious, and quick! I was kind of scared to try it because a couple of people rated it so low...DON'T LISTEN TO THEM!!! My neighbor ate with us and kept saying how much better than the Olive Garden this was. I can't believe how good this tasted, considering it only took me 30-40 min. to make. Thank you so much!!!

MMMM, MMMM!! Prepared exactly as directed, but had to use mozzarella cheese instead of Parmesan.  Restaurant quality!  Shrimp and portobellos go so great together.

So disappointed when I make something and then rate it low. So VERY bland. Made it as per recipe, but added two extra cloves of garlic. Had to add salt and pepper after serving up to give it some sort of flavor. Just did not do it for us....

Excellent, substituted fat-free for cream cheese and used fat free half-half creamer, added Campbells condensed mushroom soup to help thicken. Turned out terrific!!!  Will keep as one of my favorites.  Also added broccoli florets...

This is an awesome recipe that will be sure to impress your friends and it is so easy!  I made a few changes to make it a little healthier by reducing the amount of butter and using milk instead of cream.  The dish still tasted very rich.  Definitely a keeper!!!

So good! Restauarant quality! I made this last night and it was great! I added a little more garlic, 1/3 c butter instead of 1/2 (just trying to reduce some calories!) and milk instead of cream. It was still thick and delicious. I also folded in crab meat. I thought this had a ton of flavor! Thanks!

Great as is .The rest of you people have no brain area to comprehend that this recipe is to be made as the artist has offered. I made it the way intended and it is totally a best seller. I made it for my restaurant for a smiley add on and it was a big hit! Don't knock it if you can't prepare simple food ladies and quit trying to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear when it's already a silk purse. Thank you Bonniet310, you will be remembered in our menu and a super big thanks! Gary

This recipe is awesome, I've been using it for years and just never reviewed it, but I'm making it again tonight and thought it deserved some stars from me!  My husband doesn't care for that much shrimp, so I've been making it with chicken instead and it's still oh-so good, and you don't have to change the recipe a bit, it's great as is!

I was unimpressed with this dish - there was waaaay too much butter and cream in this, and I normally don't even care about that stuff! The cream cheese was pointless - all the other cream in the dish masked it. There also wasn't too much taste to the meal. I'm giving it 3 stars only because my brother seemed to like it. Thanks anyway!

Shared this with the office--Everyone loved it!  I did make a few adjustments--I used 1/2 shrimp and 1/2 crawfish and used 1/2 whipping cream and half and half.  Very rich and very good.

DeLICious!!!  It made my kitchen smell great, too.  :)  I was worried there would be too many mushrooms and too many shrimp, but the amount was perfect.  There was just enough of everything that we'll have yummy leftovers for a few days.

Low-carbed it and it was delish! Since other reviews complained that the sauce was too thick, I was able to cut out the flour all together. I used a whole 8 oz of cream cheese and just a splash of cream and milk as needed to get it saucy. I used a Cajun seasoning I found on this site, threw in about a 1/4 cup of diced celery with the onion (because it was on the verge of going bad & needed to be used), skipped the noodles and instead served the shrimp and sauce over spaghetti squash. I only had a lb of shrimp on hand, but it was excellent! I was generous with the spice and still used a pound of mushrooms. I will definitely make again- super easy!

Wonderful dish my family didn't believe that I had made it from scratch!  I've made this twice now the first time the sauce was rich and thick the second and I don't know what I did but it didn't thicken up and I switched to button mushrooms won't do that again the Portobello mushrooms gave it a better taste.  It's on the once a month list with my family so I'm hoping I don't mess it up again! I would highly recommend this dish and it's easy to make!

This was tasty, but a little spicy for this type of dish. I used the Cajun Seasoning Mix from this site for my seasoning. Next time I will cut the seasoning in half. I do like spicy food, but thought the spice overpowered the other flavors. After reading some other reviews, I opted to replace the cream with whole milk. It was still very thick, and I thinned the sauce with some of the pasta water. I only put about 3/4 of the cooked pasta into the sauce as well.

It was okay. The sauce is really thick and it coats your mouth. Overall it is a good backup fettuccine recipe.

This is a wonderful, rich recipe.  The only thing I changed was to coat the raw shrimp with the cajun spice before added.  Kids loved it too!

I thought this was good, but could have used a little more flavor. Also, next time I won’t use the flour. I thought it made the sauce wayyyy too thick and I needed to add some pasta water back into it to thin it out. Also, I didn’t use butter to cook the mushrooms/onions. I used olive oil. Maybe that’s why it was lacking some flavor?

Very good but way, way too salty.  I will use unsalted butter and omit salt altogether, next time.  The salt in the cajun spice is enough.

Great recipe!  I used white mushrooms and a little less cream cheese than the recipe called for.   I also added some sliced peppers and broccolini for colour and it worked very well.   Will make this again!

That sauce was fabulous. Of course my picky kids won't touch anything with shrimp or mushrooms, but my husband and I devoured it. 
I made it keto-friendly by using zoodles instead of noodles and omitting the flour, which also brought the calorie count down significantly, but of course, real noodles taste a kajillion times better, and thick sauce would be better than thin. Diets suck. But this dish is amazing.

I really like it. I didn't have fettuccine so I used Penne which takes a little longer to cook according to the package. I was a little worried about it a couple of times, the sauce wasn't smoothing out, then it was too thick, ect , but I think it came out pretty well in the end.

Easy to prepare.  I did substitute Leek for the green onion. I like leek as a replacement.  little different flavor and leek keeps better than green onions. Wife loved it.

Delicious and quick enough for a week night meal! Used up our left over cream cheese and shrimp. I just used a combo of red pepper flakes, cajun seasoning, salt, pepper, garlic pepper, oregano, and thyme for the cajun seasoning.

Made this today, although with slightly different measurements and low-fat alternatives for the cream and cream cheese. Plus, I used chanterelles instead of portobello mushrooms and I followed LYNNE216's reccomendation to replace the cajun seasoning with salt, pepper, cayenne, paprika and onion powder (and a bit of garlic powder), only I used slightly more than they did.
All in all a great recipe, even though I suspect it would have been very heavy had I used full-fat ingredients.

WOW! This is delicious!  Hubby and I both loved it and we will make it again.  I'm not sure if my proportions of cream cheese and cream were right, I used what I had.  Also, the shrimp I had were jumbos, so I put them in the skillet before the cream since they needed some extra time.  The only thing I will add next time is some fresh jalapenos with the shrimp.  I used Old Bay Cajun seasoning and it was perfect.

This was so good! I made some changes, not due to previous reviews, but because of what I had on hand. I sauteed the onions and garlic with a yellow pepper and some regular mushrooms. I only used half of the butter, and used some white wine while sauteeing. I also used 3 oz of dill flavoured cream cheese - again, it was what I had on hand. I personally don't think it made a difference in flavour. I made the sauce as directed, except I used half and half, and thank goodness because I think whipping cream would've been WAY too thick. I added a bit extra parm, but thats more for personal preference. I didn't have 2lbs of shrimp, which was why I added the yellow pepper, to compensate for the loss of the shrimp. I put those all together once the sauce was thickened. I topped with fresh tomatoes, and a homemade basil pesto which was YUMMY. Will totally be making this again!

did a couple of revisions.
first - pasta was kamut linguini from bulk barn.  we love the nutty flavour of the grain.
second - less butter, more olive oil.  at lower temps it cooks quite well.
third - no cream - wife is lactose intolerant - but cheese is good - so a combination of a little additional cream cheese, as well as using grana padano instead of parmigiano (a different, distinctive flavour).
and a small sprinkling of chili flakes - to give it some more zing.  a great recipe base - but as always a suggestion - not an absolute edict on ingredients.
we may also try some cilantro next time - this is also an italian herb used with some of their pastas - and one of our faves.

This receipe is a keeper.  I used 4 oz. of Onion & Chives cream cheese.  Next time I am going to make it without the shrimp as we found it was a delicious sauce for pasta.

I made this today and it was phenomenal!  I did not have cajun seasoning, so i followed another reviewer's advice and used 1/4 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and 1/4 tsp onion powder!  i used spiral pasta instead of fettucine and omitted the green onion.  will DEFINITELY make again!

I made this without the shrimp, as I'm vegetarian. It was so delicious! But the sauce was rather thick, so if you don't like that then you'd want to thin it out. But it was fine for me, I loved this!

mdae this with 2/3 the pasta, all of the cream cheese and whipping cream, and it was great.
Easy, quick, tasty.
