We loved them! Crab legs are already perfect, simplicity should be the rule in preparation.

Used this recipe the first time I made crab legs, and they turned out amazing! So flavorful and I usually have a ton butter for dipping, but in this dish no dip needed. For the seafood seasoning I used Durkee chicken and fish grill creations. 
I will definitely make this again

My new go-to recipe for crab legs. Very easy. I love that I can make so many @ one time & we can all actually eat together unlike the boiling method. Agree with others to make extra sauce for dipping!

Sorry for the blurry pic.. but this was EXCELLENT! My hubby & I both love seafood. Before we always boiled them in water with tons of seasoning that wouldn't stick. Putting them in the oven and baking them made a huge difference. I love garlic so the minced garlic was the best along with the old bay & butter. Hubby actually made this & made too much so we basted the crab legs with the mixture. It was the better than a restaurant.

Made as written and this turned out really good. I decided to double the sauce and reserve half for dipping. Very good!

I’ll never boil them again! These were fantastic. After I Poured the sauce over the crab I added a little beer to the pan, covered with tin foil and baked for about 15-20 minutes. Delicious!

This was amazing! Followed the recipe exactly and it was better than any king crab legs I’ve ordered in a restaurant. I won’t make them any other way than this from now on.

I love the baking technique, but will probably just do the sauce without the Old Bay next time. I have a feeling my Old Bay was stale, but overpowered the sauce for us. 
Overall, really nice change and made for an easy meal with easy cleanup.

So convenient to bake in the oven.  Got the crab legs at Costco.  Came out fantastic!  Seasoning was just right!  Didn't even need additional butter.
