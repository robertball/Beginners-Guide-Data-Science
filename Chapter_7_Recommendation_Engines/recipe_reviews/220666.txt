This recipe was a relatively easy recipe to put together and was a great success as an appetizer.  The flavor was a very pleasant surprised.  I made one modification in the recipe because it looked like too much cheese so I put in about 60% of what the recipe called for and it turned out to be a good call. Everyone who had some of this asked for the recipe.

This is like another recipe I tried this weekend, the exception being that this used bread crumbs rather than saltines.  I really couldn't tell the difference between the two except that maybe this turned out a little more compact (I used Progresso Italian crumbs).  This recipe is always a winner with company!

Carolebubs   I had made these for years and they were always a hit! Only change was Swiss cheese instead of cheddar. Both excellent

It was very tasty. I added an extra egg and instead of using 3/4 lb (12 oz ) of sharp cheddar I used 6 oz sharp cheddar and 6 oz mozzarella. I’m glad I changed the cheese, but not that I added an extra egg.

I,ve made this basic recipe before but this was the best!  My son and I just traveled to Greece so we had a party with all food from Greece and this fit t he bill.  All I did was add lemon pepper on top of all the other spices and everyone loved!

I made a mistake. I only had panko and used that. It didn't hold together very much . . .it tasted great though.
