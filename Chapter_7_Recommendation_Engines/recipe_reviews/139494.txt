OMG, this was just what I needed on a cold day. It was lovely and quick to cook. I did add 1 T of sweet (not hot) paprika, 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and 1/4 tsp cumin to shake it up a bit. Delicious!

Really nice when you have a cold. Not quite as good the next day, next time I will reduce to make less.

Excellent soup. I added cumin as did one other reviewer, but I add cumin to vanilla ice cream. Great recipe Lucero. Thanks for sharing.

This soup is a great way to use up abundant garlic that is available on farms in the Northeast right now. Like another reader, I added about a half teaspoon of cumin to give it a little more flavor. To save time, toasting the bread in the toaster would work fine, as would chopping the garlic in the food processor. A very good, comforting soup!

Turned out nice. I did use veg broth and added cumin, because I love cumin! I roasted the poblano pepper for added flavor. I love garlic but was worried about it being overpowering....not the case! It was a mild flavor. I also put it in the crockpot for six or so hours on low. I think I would like stronger flavors for a main dish as well....but it is a very nice side soup! Thank you!! I really enjoyed it!!

The recipe's pretty good as written, but should really be thicker. Increase croutons, and add just enough broth to cover, adding more as needed to just keep it liquid. Also some Jamon serrano  sauteed after the garlic. I live in Mexico, and have had this in restaurants, and that's how I've had it

Yum! I served this without the bread to cut back on carbs. I also didn't use a chile pepper as I can't really handle spicy food, instead I added just a dash of tabasco sauce. I also added chicken meat to make it more substantial but it didn't really add anything so I won't use that next time. I used homemade chicken broth because it constitutes the main volume of this recipe so wouldn't use a storebought stock. I ended up having two servings! very nice as a starter or just a light meal or lunch. I'll definitely make it again :)

I'm the writer of this recipe. I put this on several years ago and make it a lot.  An easier way that I make it sometimes is to use a can (14 oz) of tomatoes--diced or whole. Obviously this increases the density of the soup. Nowadays I always make it in the slow cooker--on low for 8 hours.  Just a couple of variations.
