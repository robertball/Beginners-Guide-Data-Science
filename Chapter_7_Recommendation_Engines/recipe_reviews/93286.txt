Wow! A hot sauce that is tasty and that I can control the heat! I tried the original recipe.. nice. The 2nd time I added 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 bunch cilantro.., great!. The 3rd time, with salt & cilantro, I streamed 1/4 cup olive oil into the blender INSTEAD of the mayo... Delish!!! --no mayo aftertaste, healthier and tastier-- it seems to bring out the flavor of the lettuce and cilantro.  Update: This is my 5th try (you can tell I love this recipe) and I added 1/2 onion... OMG, how flavorful! That's it. I can not improve this further for my taste. A real winner!!!
Update 2: How I control the heat: Mildly spicy - remove the seeds and veins from the jalapenos. Spicy hot - remove the seeds only and leave the veins in.

I am Peruvian and I would really recommend if you can find a Latin store on your area (more than sure you're gonna find it), look for: AJI AMARILLO. That's our pepper and is amazing (just be sure to wash your hands really good before you think in touching your eyes)

I also added salt, pepper, and cilantro and it is great.. Has a very addictive flavor because of the  Iceberg.  I used a food processor the first time will use a blender the next.

the sauce came out a little too bland so i tried adding about a table spoon of salt as well as some cilantro. this made the sauce a little more flavorful and everyone just enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

This hot sauce is amazing.  I added a little garlic and next time will add some onion.  Outstanding flavor.  I didn't think it needed as much mayo, but it's great b/c you can play around with the consistency you want -- great flavor!!

Added onion, lime juice and cucumber to add some freshness. Cilantro would have been great but didn't have any. Family didn't like the bread aspect. Will find another recipe. Will not make this one again.

Horrible. Tastes NOTHING like the real thing. And that might be forgivable if it tasted good, but it is just appalling
