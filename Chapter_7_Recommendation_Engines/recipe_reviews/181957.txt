Wow.  These were really delicious and so easy to prepare.  Next time I will probably omit the butter as it didn’t really add to the taste but it did add to the calories.

Note: The 2 slices of bacon is a typo, it was originally 2 ounces of slab bacon (although I have used sliced bacon with equally god results as well). Thanks for the reviews!

What a fabulous recipe!!!  Made these several times and there were no left overs.  On one occasion I omitted the bacon and they were just as delicious without it.  A delicious recipe for green beans and an easy one to prepare. Will make these many more times in the future.

I only made half a recipe since it was just for Hubs and me, so it didn't require 15 minutes to cook the beans until crisp/tender and for them to retain their brilliant color.  Bacon makes any vegetable better and I include it frequently, but I found the minced onion and lemon to be nice additions that really perked this up. I left out the red pepper flakes and didn't miss it -  I don't  think including it or not makes these beans any better one way or the other. They'd be delicious either way.

I made this today with fresh picked green beans. I used pork sausage pattie grease instead of bacon and chicken broth instead of water. It was so fun to make and delicious! I will definately make this again and again!

My go-to green bean recipe for nice dinners or when we have people over. The trick is not to overcook!

I made this for a work Christmas party and it was very well recieved--enough that I didn't get to sample it myself! I heard varying comments on the spice, from "just enough kick" to "too spicy for me". However the overall opinion was excellent dish. Maybe 1/2 the red pepper flakes, for those with spice sensitivities.

I have been making this recipe for a long time, but an easier way is to cook the bacon with the onions, dry on paper towel, save til later.  Steam the fresh green beans with garlic salt and pepper until dark green but still crispy.  Pour water out from steamer or double broiler, return beans to the pan and add the bacon onion mixture, stiring until blended.  Add some sliced almond on top.  I also make these with redskins in one pan as they show on the picture.  The bacon seeps into the potatoes and it is a meal in itself.

Excellant!  I did leave out the butter to make it a bit healthier.  One note I will say, if you use frozen "fresh" beans (like those you've frozen out the garden) you do not need nearly the boiling water.  I ended up with very watery beans, scooping some out for dinner, and leaving the rest in the pan while the water reduced.  This made the beans get a bit grayer than I'm sure they're supposed to be.  But very, very yummy!  I will be making these for our family Christmas.

These were delicious with a nice kick from the red pepper flakes.  To be healthier, use olive oil in place of the bacon.

this recipe was awesome! I have some pretty good green bean recipes, but wanted to try something a litttle different and this was the bomb! I used canned beans was the only difference. Will make again and again- oh yeh, it was a last minute side- took about 10 minutes.

These are pretty spicy but very tasty! I ended up doubling the green beans & bacon to tone down the spice-plus we now have leftovers for tonight! Yum!

What doesn’t bacon make taste better?  The good news is that just a small amount of bacon adds a lot of flavor without breaking the nutritional bank.  I cooked the onion and bacon, omitting the red pepper flakes, ahead and then steamed the beans right before I was ready to serve them.    I served them with a marinated roasted pork tenderloin, corn risotto, and Spectacular Marsala Glazed Carrots with Hazelnuts from this site.  It was a perfect meal.

I thought that the bag of trimmed and cleaned green beans I bought was 1 lb. Nope, it was 12 ozs. No problem. I kept all of the measurements as written except decreased to 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. The cooking time was perfect for my beans. Thank you, Eric. Delicious!

Everyone in my family agreed that these green beans were great and should be made again. Yumms  I had to add that I didn't add butter either. It will not be missed with all the bacon flavoring.

Super easy and turns out good every time.  Depending on quantity, sometimes i have to let them cook a little longer after adding the water, but i just "taste test" a bean here and there to see when they are tender.  Workes well with haricort vert also instead of regular beans.  All Yummy!

I really liked this recipe. I usually don't care for green beans but I thought I'd try some fresh home made. I followed the recipe for 2 to a tee. The reason I am only giving it 4 stars is because it was too spicy for me. Next time I will omit the spice. Thanks for the easy recipe!

Doubled the recipe for a church Board Meeting Supper. They turned out great, and everyone loved them! The only thing I changed was that I used Vegetable Broth instead of water, and added a touch of garlic. Yummy!!

These were really good. I only steamed them for 10 minutes though and they were perfectly cooked. 15 minutes would have overcooked them I think. Thank you for the recipe.

I thought these were good.  The onions caramelized in the pan, which was very good!  The bacon added a nice, salty bite.  My only issue with them is that I think 15 minutes was a little long--the beans started to lose a lot of their green by that time.  Also, I could not taste the lemon juice, and that is too bad, because I was really looking forward to a lemony flavor.  Next time, I think I will cut the cooking time down a bit and add a touch more lemon.  My other complaint was my own fault--they were a little greasy because the kind of bacon I used (read: cheap) gave off a lot more drippings than I think the author's must have.  These are a nice change of pace, and I will probably make again.

I tried this recipe last year and forgot to rate it. Needless to say, family members are begging for me to bring these green beans for Thanksgiving. Of all the other fixings, this one is the ONE that stands out. They turned out delicious and I am ever so grateful for this recipe! Thank you!

This was amazing. New family staple. Maple bacon gave it some good punch and a dash of sweetness. Plus I used canned green beans instead of fresh (taking out the need to add water to steam them) and it was still an amazingly tasty and still healthy dish! Props!!!

Yummy. My daughter refuses to eat fresh green beans (she loves the ones from the can), but I'm on a mission to eat healthier. These were a good compromise. She didn't love them, but didn't hate them. I call that a success!

Okay, so I rate these a four, but I had to substitute one of the most essential ingredients to make this (fresh green beans) - and though it came out good, I think it would be better to rate this recipe with the fresh beans.  I had to use can beans because my grocer was all out of fresh beans.  I did everything the same, except instead of water I used the can juice.  I also seasoned my beans with a touch of paprika and garlic powder and added quartered small red potatoes.  My family loved this, but I will have to make it again with fresh beans.

These were amazing.  I had to use canned beans because the fresh didn't look so fresh when I went shopping and they were still sooo good!  I skipped the butter and was good I did.  They were perfect.

Even though I used back bacon instead of bacon strips, and overcooked the onions - this was still very, very good. I look forward to making it the right way next time. It will be totally outstanding.

Really amazing green beans, but not for the faint of heart when it comes to fat.  I cooked the bacon quite crispy & and only added when I served it.  That created a nice crunch.  I did reduce the steaming time to about eight minutes; I like my veggies to have crunch.

I made a few changes, but I think the core of the recipe is very sound!

Call me crazy, but I really like to sautee tofu in bacon grease. This way I get a lot of meaty, tasty flavor without actually eating as much meat. So I used three bacon slices, then added diced tofu to the pan at the onion stage, then removed it (left it with the bacon), and continued the recipe as written. It was much more filling and made a casual main meal. The second time I made it, I made it the same as the first time (with the tofu) and just for fun added some diced ginger, which I thought was very tasty. Serve with cauliflower rice for a nice paleo meal.

I will never make "Green Bean Casserole" again! I came here looking for a fresh, more authentic (than canned cream soup) recipe for green beans when I found this one. At first, my teen daughter discouraged me and asked me why I needed a green bean recipe for Thanksgiving in the first place. I am a traditionalist in many ways and just thought it would be nice to have a green bean dish as I'd always had throughout my childhood. Thankfully, I stayed the course and made this recipe. As soon as I tasted it, I quickly sent it out to my friends and family -- it's THAT GOOD! Since I have young children, I did omit the red pepper flakes. However, the lemon juice, which I thought would be trivial, gave it a beautiful and subtle tang that I would have missed out on if I had omitted that. I also added more bacon because, let's be honest, what isn't better with more bacon? ;) (I now see that the amount of bacon had an error with the original posting, so that makes sense!) This is now my traditional Thanksgiving and Christmas green bean recipe, and I'm sure we'll be taking it to pot lucks in the summertime, too. Just love it!

Wow what a great recipe!  I've made these three times in the last couple of weeks. I omitted the lemon because they were so good when done and wasn't sure I'd like it any better with the lemon, I forgot the red pepper flake altogether (just realized that), used more chopped onion than called for bc I love the onion sautéed in the bacon grease, and these were just wonderful with the perfect hint of bacon. There really is no need to add the crumbled up bacon on top which I think could overpower the great taste of the green beans. I found that after adding the boiling water, cooking/steaming them for 15 minutes was too long. I don't necessarily like my beans crisp but cooking for 5 or 6 minutes was plenty. Next time I will try adding in the lemon and pepper flake. Also used frozen green beans which I allowed to thaw (probably didn't have to,) and these were great!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe, and something slightly different to do with green beans! My husband, my two oldest sons, and I all liked these really well. My one and a half year old kind of just picked at it, but he did end up trying a couple of bites. Since the majority of us liked the beans I will be making these again. The bacon added a great flavor, and the butter/lemon juice tasted wonderful. Thanks for the recipe, Eric!

This was a big hit this Christmas.  The first time I made it without the pepper flakes due to 'heat' sensitivity and the second time I made it without the onions due to someone not liking onions but it was an awesome recipe both ways. I am not inclined to change a thing.

I omitted the red pepper flakes and butter and used chicken broth instead of plain water. The beans were good but still kind of bland. I also added minced garlic with the lemon juice. Next time I will try more salt and that will probably do the trick.

These are good and EASY! Few things--- got the pre cooked pack of bacon and the twin pack green beans from SAMs club. Had to use some of it up. Just cut up the bacon and cooked the onion in a little EVOO instead of the bacon grease. Plus added a little less butter. Yummmmy! My husband said it was a little on the spicy side, which this would be good even if u reduced or omitted the red pepper flakes. You could probably replace the flakes for minced garlic? I'll try that next time. Very good! Should be a hit!

Swapped out the bacon for diced pancetta, either way, it has amazing flavor. The lemon gives it a subtle kick! The 15 mins was too long to cook, making the green beans too soft/soggy. Recommend checking on it after 8-10 mins. Love this recipe!

This recipe was okay, but after eating it, I felt like all the extras just buried the taste of fresh green beans. I think I prefer  fresh crisp green beans steamed with salt and butter added at the end.  This wasn't a bad recipe....just not one I would repeat.

These were very good and probably would be even better minus a few of my mistakes.  I made this for Thanksgiving.  I'm used to broiling by green beans because sometimes steaming can make them soggy - especially since I had to reheat these. I did steam them but just for a little bit.  Then I promptly forgot to add lemon.  Later, after taking them to the other house, I realized I forgot the bacon.  Still, they were delicious so I'm sure they would be even better if I had managed to pay attention

Delicious. I didn't need to use all the bacon drippings as it made it a little greasier than I would like, but it is a definite keeper!

This was fabulous.  Made it exactly as printed.  Wish I'd have doubled or tripled the recipe.  I will for sure next time.

I did not alter the recipe and made it as directed and found it to be quite delicious. Most of my picky green bean eaters (believe it or not they are adults) finished them off the plate and I enjoyed the different layers of flavor. I found them to have just the right amount of zing but if you do not like spicy, I would recommend lessening the pepper flakes...

This recipe was good for a change but not sure I would make it all the time. Followed the recipe to the letter except did not have crushed red pepper so used a mix of cayenne pepper and black pepper. The spiciness with green beans was a nice change though, will make from time to time.

Fabulous, easy, excellent recipe. Followed it to a T minus the lemon cause I didn't have any. Initially thought it might be a little spicy but it was perfect. Did reduce the butter with little flavor consequence.

This has got to be the best way to cook green beans.  Everyone including my fussy eaters loved them.  I should have made a bigger batch.
