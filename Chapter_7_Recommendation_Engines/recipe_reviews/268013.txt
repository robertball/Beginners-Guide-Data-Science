This was fabulous and so easy.  Only change was I used half of a big a jar of artichoke hearts in oil from Costco. Before adding cheese it looked a bit curdled but once cheese was added it’s creamy and perfect. Everybody loved it!

Made on the stovetop- didn't take long at all. Would add more parmesan next time, but absolutely delicious!

This was very good!!! I didn’t add the shredded cheeses at the end as I wasn’t going to serve it right away. Instead I made it ahead of time and refrigerated it overnight and reheated it, then added the cheeses. It reheats well that was and still tasted fantastic!

Delicious!  I used fresh baby spinach and added a can of green chilis (diced).  Cooked for just 2 minutes on high pressure.

It's a great dip! If you prep all of your ingredients, it cooks in a flash! Seriously, just grind for ten minutes prepping and the dip is done in even less time. I'd probably do a little less grated parmesan next time and slightly more fresh garlic. I'll definitely make it again for gamedays or at the firehouse.

Absolutely loved this dip.... next time I am adding a little more garlic... but this was amazing.  Super easy to make and I even had kids sitting at the table dipping into the dip.

I've tried so many Spinach Artichoke dips that just didn't measure up....This one was spot on!! Followed the directions as written, and it didn't disappoint! The texture was creamy, and the taste was incredible. This is my new favorite!
