Love this recipe! Although it calls for too much tahini (I used only 1 TBSP).  I've tried it with many other "marmalade" type items and it is always a big hit!

This is a pretty good basic recipe.  I decided to give it a try because I thought the addition of the orange might win over my wife, who has previously been pretty wary of hummus.  She loved the result... if she was writing this, it would get 5 stars, instead of the 4 I give it.  I made the recipe as written, except for the following changes: 1) I used Smuchers Sugar Free Orange Marmelade in place of the Low Sugar product listed in the recipe; and  2) I thought the recipe as written might be a bit bland for my tastes, and I was right when I sampled it right after mixing, so I added 1/4 tsp paprika and 2 tsp lemon juice.  That made things much better, in my opinion.

This hummus was awesome...with a few adjustments. I used far less tahini - only 1 tablespoon. I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic - I find that fresh garlic in hummus is just too overpowering. And I added about 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice. Even with the added lemon juice it was still thicker than we are used to, so next time I'll probably add more. The addition of the marmalade is genius - who would have thought! Definitely a new favorite.

Since I seldom use tahini, I’ve stopped buying it because it ends up being thrown out, a waste of money.  Instead, I just mix in peanut butter and sesame oil as a replacement which I did with this recipe.  I think this is a recipe where you adjust the seasonings to your taste which in my case meant more orange marmalade, more cumin, and a little bit of the bean liquid I’d reserved to reach our preferred consistency.  Topped with a drizzle of olive oil and a squeeze of fresh orange.  We love hummus, I have a number of recipes that I make, and this one will be added.  We liked it, good recipe and different, too!

I tried this recipe using Bicks gourmet hot pepper relish, as I didn't have marmalade on hand.  Everyone enjoyed the great taste with kick of the hot peppers.  This is definately a keeper.

I liked the sweet taste of this variation on hummus and actually thought it had a slight peanut buttery taste.

Very delicious combination! The orange was perfect. My bf, who doesn't like hummus, ate 3 servings!
