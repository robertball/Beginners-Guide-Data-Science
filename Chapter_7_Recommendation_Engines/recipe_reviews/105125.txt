This recipe is outstanding, so many subtle flavors without any one of them being overwhelming. My husband called it.. succulent!  I did substitute chopped proscuitto for the canadian bacon, and added about two tablespoons of grated parmasean cheese at the very end.. served the shrimp over buttered angel hair pasta.. 
thank you for a very different and wonderful recipe

LOVE this recipe.  My kids love it.  It works with all different types of pastas, and if you don't have the precise ingredients, it's still delicious.  (We don't keep shallots on hand but use onions, for example.)  I can't rate this highly enough.

I thought this was great but my boyfriend gave it a two or three.  I thought it was very satisfying and not too fattening, but his exact words were "not something I'd want again."  Personally, I would recommend it, as I think this is a great way to enjoy whole wheat pasta.

Made this on Mother's Day and literally got a standing ovation from my parents. I went easy on the basil, heavy on the olive oil, and with the addition of some parmesan, it was excellent. I even screwed up the sun-dried tomatoes by baking them too slowly but the dish still tasted great.

This was very good and very easy.  Made it for a Wednesday night dinner for my wife and her Dad.  They loved it.  I used angel hair pasta and non-oil packed dried tomatoes as it's what I had on hand.  Will definitely do this again.

this is probably the most amazing pasta ever. it's so delicious, although for a college student it costs a ton. I think the quality of your artichoke hearts count in this one. I used really cheap ones and they were a bit tough going down. thanks for the great recipe!

this pasta dish was way too bland and dry for me. perhaps a little more olive oil may have helped.

Excellent recipe. I used Canadian Bacon as the recipe called for, but I think next time I'll try it with Pancetta. I used regular penne pasta with excellent results. This would also be great with chicken instead of shrimp as an alternate recipe. Thanks for this submission!
