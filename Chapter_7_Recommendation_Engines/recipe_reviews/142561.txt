I make this for my boyfriend and I for dinner all the time. We love it!  I use brown sugar instead of molasses and chili sauce instead of chili powder. It is best with rice noodles.

Husband's been out of town for a few days, so I wanted to make a nice meal for his return tomorrow. He loves pork tenderloin so I thought I'd give this recipe a whirl. I just made the sauce (to save time tomorrow) and it was NOT good. The flavors don't blend well, and it looks terrible. Sorry, but I'll be searching allrecipes for something else.

Interesting flavor.  I couldn't decide on whether I liked it or disliked it, so I just kept eating it.  Guess that's a good thing?  Thanks for the recipe, I enjoyed trying something a little different!

WONDERFUL! This was very easy to make.  With great hesitation, I had guests over to eat this dish the first time I made this. Looking at the ingredients I must say I was quite worried about what this was going to taste like and felt maybe I shouldn't be feeding others with this new dish. I kept everything the same, but just added a little cayenne for some hot factor and some red and green peppers. EVERYONE loved it and are STILL raving about it. My picky hubby said this was the best dish I have ever made!Thank you for a very tasty and easy dish!

I wasnt scared of the mix of ingredients, however I am not sure about the sauce.  Everyone ate it, and they said they liked it, but maybe they didnt want to hurt my feelings?  Little too much PB maybe.  It was much better with the dish than on it's own when I first tasted it.  Since I wasnt real sure about the sauce, I left my chops whole.  Those were very tasty.  I had to increase the spices by about 6X (I had about 8 chops) and the sauce I only doubled.  Good thing I only doubled that.  One would have been plenty.  I served the sauce with Orzo because it was all I had.  Well I had brown rice but wanted something different than rice.  And it was nice to have a little sauce on the chops so it was nice to have that option rather than to dish it all up together.  Not sure if I will make again.  Need more feedback from the family.  But thanks for sharing!

I liked this. It's good when you're in the mood for something different.  I used spicy salsa so it  was good and hot.  Very nice.

Quite an easy dish - The sauce is just a spicy version of a peanut sauce (the flavor of the peanut butter dominates). While this one was quite nice, I do know recipes for better ones, so may use a different sauce recipe if I make it in future. The pork was nice, though found I had to cook it for nearly twice as long as stated. Served with rice and stir fry vegetables.

Easy to make and very good - I halved the recipe but basically followed it as exactly as I could. I used natural crunchy peanut butter and wound up having to put more water in the sauce. Ate it with rice. My boyfriend, who loves Thai food (don't know if this is remotely authentic, but it's tasty), requested that I cook up more meat because it was good and there was enough sauce! So that's a good sign. And it's really VERY simple.

Not bad, but an interesting combination of ingredients, especially in the peanut sauce!  I used medium salsa, and the sauce turned out with a bit of a bite but not too much; I think the heat will depend on the salsa you use.  It makes more peanut sauce than needed; perhaps I couldve halved it and been fine.  However, I did think it was too thick so thinned it with more water several times--I probably added about a cup of water when all was said and done, so that might've done it.  I added red peppers and served over Brazilian white rice.  A pretty decent meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is one of the stranger combinations I've come across, but it was very easy and really good. I added red bell pepper, bamboo shoots, and baby corn. I sprinkled black sesame seeds on the top and served over rice. Thanks!

Definitely an interesting combination of flavors.  I ended up adding more water because the sauce really was too thick.  Otherwise, delicious!  May try to bake pork chops next time after coating to free up my stove more.  Awesome recipe as is!

My husband and I really liked the flavor of the pork in the spices, but the sauce wasn't good!  If I can find a better sauce for the pork, I'll make it again, but not like this! Sorry!

Very easy and very good.  I added some extra water to the sauce because it was so thick...otherwise didn't change a thing.  My hubby loved it!
