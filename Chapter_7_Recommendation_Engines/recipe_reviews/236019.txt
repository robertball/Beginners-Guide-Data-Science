For as simple as the ingredients sound, these were delicious! I did use leftover mashed potatoes that were mashed w/ butter, milk and s&p, so I had to add a bit more flour. These were super flavorful with a nice, crisp outside, and creamy goodness inside. I made these smaller than called for so the kids wouldn't have a hard time handling them. I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made these for my gentile husband on the first day of Hanukkah. He had only ever had latkes one other time when we fortunately stumbled upon a Jewish food festival in Savannah, GA, a few years ago, and he enjoyed the ones we had thenâ€”but he LOVED the ones we made with this recipe!! The only adjustments we made was to substitute white onions for green onions, which added a lovely color and allowed the flavors of the potatoes and the seasonings to really take center spotlight, and to add a few more tablespoons of AP flour to make sure the dough could hold a shape before we put it in the oil. Other than that, we followed the recipe exactly as written, and we ended up with latkes so rich and delicious that neither of us ended up bothering to add any condiments like the traditional applesauce. I seriously cannot understate how much we enjoyed the latkes made from this recipe. My husband even begged me to save the recipe so we could make it again next year, too! 

NOTE: I do not recommend pairing latkes with guacamole. My husband had made some a few days prior, and we needed to eat it before it went bad, so we ended up serving our latkes with chips and guacamole on the side. It wasn't *bad,* but it definitely didn't make anything better, either.

I always make extra potatoes  so I have enough to make these for breakfast.  I make a wetter mix and spoon onto a griddle , lightly coated with bacon grease and brown, flip, brown. Much easier than frying and less oily!

Having tried many variations of Latkes and potato pancakes with varying levels of success, none really satisfying. This was a real surprise.  Exactly the taste for which I have been searching and , frankly, a whole lot easier. One slight alteration, that may have had no effect, but is a personal choice for many fried items; I used Wondra Flour. It is malted and therefore produces a crisp that lasts. NO other changes were made.

7-3-2016  ~I backed off on the onion a bit  as the amount called for was more than I would have cared for.  Also, I did not use primo extra virgin olive oil for this - common vegetable oil did the job nicely - just make sure your heat is high enough to brown these latkes and so that they don't absorb oil, making them unpleasantly greasy.  These earned a solid vote of approval from Hubs this morning with our breakfast.

These were really delicious.  I've tried making latkes before but was always disappointed with the results.  These were spot on.  I only had green onions so I sliced them thin and added them, along with some chives that were in my garden.  Served them with sour cream.  My husband ate six of them!  I still had leftover mixture so I fried the rest and put them in  freezer bags for future use.   Thanks for a great recipe, definitely will make again and again.

This was a very good recipe and I will use it in the future. Only change I would make (and did make after first attempt) was starting with "baseball-sized balls." This just made them to big and not cooking correctly. I made a smaller ball and they worked fantastic. I also used mashed potatoes (so had milk and butter from the night before) with skins and had zero issues. Fried in a cast iron skillet with plenty of bacon grease and truly amazing!

Yummy, I used regular pepper.  Great for a new dinner side dish. My potatoes were left overs with some butter and milk whipped in.

These were amazing. It was so awesome to make latkes without having to take out my food processor/blender.  I basically made mashed potatoes and then followed this recipe.  They were delicious.  Thank you!

Oops. Sorry. I just realized that the title Baked Potato Latkes refers to the use of baked potatoes. I was looking for a recipe to bake the latkes in the oven.

SO EASY! My family also loves potato skins and we end up with lots of leftover baked potato. Omitted the garlic entirely and used 5 green onions for a more subtle flavor - family approved. 6 large potatoes yielded approximately 3 cups of mashed potatoes.

We made these when we had left over potato after making potato tacos. I had never managed to make potato pancakes that didn't fall apart. These didn't fall apart and they were delicious!

10 thumbs up! (There are five of us). Would make these more often if I had left-over whipped potatoes.

I also add shredded carrots to the onion potato mix.  Been making it for years this way ahead of time.  Freeze them and they re ready for lent with our fish fry.  Love em with applesauce.  Just pop them in the oven or pan fry.
