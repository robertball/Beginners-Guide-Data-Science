This was pretty good but I had to up the amount of chili powder quite a bit. (About 1 more Tablespoon)  Mind you chili powders are not all created equally.  I think some finely chopped onion & garlic in the sauce instead of the powder would have added that little something that this recipe seemed to lack.  Thanks for the recipe, No Baking Papa was a happy camper.

This worked perfectly for meatballs! I added the requisite grape jelly to this recipe when I didn't have any prepared chili sauce.

I noticed that a lot of people followed this recipe without changes so that's what I did.  I cut it in half because I'm cooking for two, otherwise I didn't deviate from the original recipe.  My husband says it was Excellent!  I will be making this recipe for now on.

Excellent  recipe!! My husband absolutely loved it!  I did add a little beer and teaspoon of apple cider vinegar.  I cooked mine in the crock pot. So it tasted delicious by dinner time! Just great!

This a very good sauce, but instead of cutting the recipe in half, like some reviewers, just freeze 1/2 or add a small can of pinto beans & some chopped nopalitos. Makes a nice chili

I love this! We've tried every can of hot dog chili available to us and they all fall very short on flavor. I did change this up a little bit because there are only two of us. I halved everything in the recipe except the chili powder (I used 1 1/2 tbs) and after tasting at the end shook in just a dash more garlic powder and paprika. I should also add that it took less time to simmer down since it was not as much. Thanks for the recipe and goodbye canned chili!!

My 9 yr old son requested chili cheese dogs for his birthday party so I was looking for a simple chili without beans and huge chunks of peppers and onions (which is the way I'd prefer to eat chili!).  This was perfect, just meat and really good flavor.  The boys all loved it on their dogs and I even put it on some nachos with cheese.  Very good flavor, you could even just eat it by itself.

Made this exactly as written for my daughter's birthday chili cheese dogs.  We all liked it, but I personally felt it could use some diced onion and a little more spice next time I make it.

This is the best hot dog chili sauce that I have tasted. I made the full recipe. I spooned it into ice cube trays and froze them. 
I can take as many chili cubes out that I need.
I will never buy the caned chili sauce from the store again. Thank you JRich for the recipe.

Family loved it!  Went well as a sloppy Joe  to others when ran out of hot dogs.  Did add a little 
more spice.

I thought this recipe was excellent! I only made half of it so I just pretty much cut the ingredients in half and maybe it was a little salty, but other than that it was awesome! Will make again

This is by far my favorite recipe for chili dogs. Very important to use low sodium beef broth or it will turn out to salty..I made this for my grandkids for dinner and they loved it.....dont forget the bag of cheese.....

Love this recipe! I’ve made it a few times, and it’s just tasty. Easy recipe to cut in half too. Today I added chili beans and it was great.

I really like the idea but didn't particularly care for the spice ratio.  I'm making it again tomorrow and will cut WAY back on paprika, and add much more garlic, onion, cumin and chili powder.  

Those things are really just personal preference though - the consistency was perfect and was exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks!

Good flavor, a little sweeter than I like, will make changes. Made enough to freeze for later, so overall it worked out good.

Loved it! Not only was it delish with grilled Sahlen’s hotdogs, it was also great with nachos.

I have tried so many canned & refrigerated hot dog chilis, and they were all too greasy or bland. I added extra spices, & it was delicious!! We ate it on noodles with cheese and as  nachos. It was good as both!  I was making it for chili dogs tomorrow, but we had to have some after we smelled & tasted it! Thanks for the great recipe!!

We loved this recipe! We used the Tastefully Simple Wahoo Chili powder. Next time I’m going to add just teaspoon or two of brown sugar.

It's not bad, but it tastes more like regularly chili than hotdog chili.

I actually tossed 2 cans of light kidney beans beans in it, and ate it as chili beans.

I only gave this 4 stars as the  chili sauce is too salty. Next time I will cut the salt. Also, it needs a bit of cumin. With those 2 changes I would rate it a 5 - Nothing I could do about the salt but yes I did add cumin to taste and it is much better.

My family loves this  hot dog chili! The only thing I changed was the chili powder...I used hot Mexican chili powder to give it a kick. Really good!

Good chili for our hotdogs , spicy and flavorful.  The beef broth as the base is what got me to try this one.

Best hot dog chili I have ever made. Thanks for the recipe!

I made a half batch and made some mods.  All measurements are for the half batch.

I only had coarsely ground beef and it cooked up lumpy, so after I drained it in a colander and let it set a few minutes and then ran it through a food processor in batches, a few seconds each batch. This gave me a nice smooth ground beef.  
I used a 14oz can (half batch)  of fire roasted tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes and ran it through the food processor for about two seconds because I wanted a smooth chili.  I only had regular sodium beef broth, so I left out the kosher salt.
I added a half teaspoon of cider vinegar (someone else's suggestion) to the processed tomatoes and stirred, and tasted it.  The vinegar comes through nicely.  I added a half teaspoon of Cumin to the spices.  Then I mixed all the spices together and tasted the spice mixture.  It's good.
I only cooked for an hour during the second cook because by then there was little liquid left.  This could be because I cooked a half batch in a large frying pan.
Thanks Again JRich!

Only change I made was to add a little brown sugar. It was a little too hot for my taste. Otherwise, good recipe.

This was my first time making a chili from scratch and it was easy and awesome.  I loved the taste and it freezes well.  I will continue to make this recipe for my family cookouts.  Thank you so much for sharing.

Awesome. I cut it in half because there are only four of us. I didn't change a thing (unlike other reviews of other recipes). I used a potato masher with the broth to make the beef smaller and a smoother texture. Enjoy, don't change a thing. Even the simmer time. Make it the day ahead if you don't have the time to simmer.

I wanted a beef topping for baked potatoes.  This was wonderful.  I added a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes  to only 1 lb of beef so I eliminated the broth but added 2 teaspoons of beef bouillon powder and followed the rest of the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I've never made hotdog sauce before but everyone loved this sauce!  It was very easy to make and had a good flavor.
