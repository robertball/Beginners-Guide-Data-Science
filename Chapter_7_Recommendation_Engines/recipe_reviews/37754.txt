This is a very authentic flavor. I would suggest trying this version, in which the soft flavors blend the way they're intended. I think that when you chop, dice, and spread additional ingredients into this, it takes away from the simplicity of this salad and tries too hard to overpower the intended effect. Perfect the way it is, makes a beautiful lead into a meal. Simply remove some of the basil when serving to younger diners.

Impressive and easy! I made this as an appetizer by using grape tomatoes on a toothpick with the cheese and basil. Top with oil & vinegar and pop in your mouth!

Having experienced this first hand in Italy, this recipe is exactly as found at the dinner table. This is not "tossed". Fresh mozzarela must be used, as should roma tomatoe and fresh basil leaves not the herb "basil" Serve prior to any fine pasta meal.

Very good, tasty recipe!  I decided to make this at the last minute, so had to use regular mozzerella instead of fresh.  It was still very good.  I did use fresh basil.  I found there was way too much oil/vinegar mixture though.  We ended up only putting about a tablespoon of the mixture on.

We loved this salad.  I chopped the tomatoes and cubed the cheese.  I also coarsely chopped the basil.  I did this primarily for ease of eating for my 6-year-old (and she loved it too). I used the balsamic vinegar. I will definitely make again and again.

Great as a salad OR as a sandwich served on hard crusty rolls!  Perfect for a summer picnic.

I make this recipe often when tomatoes are in season but I add a couple of cloves of garlic chopped along with the fresh basil.  It really adds great flavour!  I find it keeps fairly well over night and frequently add the marinated slices of tomatoes to burgers the next day.

A simple dish that wows a crowd, especially when you use different colored tomatoes -- I used red, yellow and orange. Fabulous for a summer dinner.

Instead of fresh mozzerella I used regular but the results were wonderful.  I used about half the amount of oil and vinegar.  It was wonderful with fresh tomatoes.

Yes, this is a very nice, classic salad. Especially nice paired with a tortallini main dish. For a change, try using fresh smoked mozzarella, it's divine.

If you have a little Italy or a gourmet shop that gets in fresh buffalo mozzarella use it!!  I dont suggest using polly-o but it would work in a pinch, any fresh made is better than prepackaged. I lived in Naples for 3 years and this is the perfect example of a Caprese salad.

This is so delicious. I could eat it every day. I added a parmesan cheese crust on top by spraying wax paper with Pam and laying a thin layer of Paremsan Chees on top, baking in 400 degree oven for 10 minutes, until crisp and breaking up into pieces on top of each tomato. Awesome. Thanks!

Quite good. Husband and I both enjoyed the treat. I might like to try grated mozzarella next time. I did, however, enjoy it much more the following day when I baked the leftovers in the oven for a few minutes.

The addition of the balsamic vinegar in this popular Italian salad made a big difference.  It was great!  I would suggest using buffalo mozzarella - is the best kind of fresh mozzarella out there.  I personally prefer mixing everything together in a bowl rather than layering - it is easier to make and serve and it keeps the same flavor.

This wonderful salad is like something you'd order at a gourmet restaurant.  *Fresh* mozzarella is a must. I used yellow and red heirloom tomatoes, and followed the recipe exactly as written. It was perfect, EASY (took all of 2 minutes to prepare), and my guests loved it!

Wonderful! My husband just LOVED this! I used shredded mozzarella since it's what I had on hand - and I'm glad I did! Used garden tomatoes and basil (I sliced basil into slivers). For the vinegar, I used some purple basil vinegar I made from a recipe on this site (Basil Vinegar), and it was simply delicious! I topped with 2T chopped onion and 1/2 small can sliced black olives. Covered and chilled for about 1 hour before serving. Excellent!

This salad is so delicious!  I love to get this whenever I go to that famous Italian Grill restaurant and wanted to recreate it at home. I didn't even know my supermarket had fresh mozzarella....yum!  I did change it up a bit however...the vinegar mix sounded a bit strong for me so I added 2 tsp sugar.  I used roma tomatoes instead of normal....and also used sea salt to really bring out the flavor of the cheese.  Next time I'll leave out the basil, but that's just my personal preference.  I had a lot left over since I'm single....so I cut the cheese and tomatoes up into small chunks and put them in a plastic bag with the vinaigrette.  Once it has time to marinade, I know this will be even better tomorrow!

This is the perfect summer dish!  I used fresh yellow, red, orange and purple tomatoes from my garden.  Trader Joes has fresh mozzarella that is already sliced (very convenient) and they have a good selection of balsamic vinegars.  Be sure to use fresh picked basil (I grew mine). I added 1 garlic clove that I squeezed through a garlic press to the dressing.  Serve with a fresh baked baguette to sop up the yummy juices.  Healthy and delish!

The best!  I made this last night as an alternative to a green salad, it's refreshing!  I used smoked mozzarella for a nice twist on the traditional preparation. Fresh basil is a must, and use the balsamic.

This is so delicious!  I had both tomatoes and basil in my garden and was looking for a nice salad recipe.  Glad I tried this one.  I used Kosher salt instead of regular table salt.  Excellent recipe.

Your recipe was great.  Just wanted to add a note: I like to put  a large dollop of ricotta in the center.  It really adds to the overall freshness of the salad.  Be sure to have a good salt and fresh cracked pepper on hand.

Simple and delicious. I used fresh basil from my garden and put this on the table in less than five minutes.

This is so delicious! I love these tastes together. I just had regular mozzarella and regular dried basil. I can only imagine how wonderful this will taste this summer with fresh off the vine tomatoes, fresh cheese and basil! I too liked it both cold and then also under the broiler. Thank you!

This is a summer only dish and you can't mess this up; the flavors of the ingredients do it all. This is definitely a "less is more" recipe. I used 1/2 red wine vinegar, 1/2 good balsamic. Perfect.  Some tips: First: use only super fresh tomatoes - homegrown is best, farmer's market heirlooms are a close second. NEVER,EVER refrigerate a tomato!!! Kills the flavor and makes the tomato mushy. Second: best tool for cutting fresh mozarella is dental floss. Glide or another non sticky brand works best - obviously avoid minted! Third: spring for fresh basil; it is always available in the supermarket. Dried is a completely different flavor - belongs in spagetti sauce where long cooking brings out its flavor.
