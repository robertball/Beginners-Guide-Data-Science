I really like the creamy consistency of this smoothie. It was my first time trying tofu in a smoothie, and I think this recipe has a great ratio of tofu to milk and pumpkin puree. I would just drastically reduce the amount of cinnamon. I added slightly less than a tablespoon of cinnamon and slightly less than 1/2 a teaspoon of nutmeg because I was worried that they would be too strong, and they still were so overpowering, they made the smoothie taste almost bitter. I will try this again with just 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.

I made it at school for children to sample.  Although they all thought it was funny they ate tofu without knowing, they didn't enjoy the taste.  Staff wasn't so keen either.  Some people said it tasted like Christmas cake batter!

Taste so good and good for you too. I used frozen bananas and soy milk.
