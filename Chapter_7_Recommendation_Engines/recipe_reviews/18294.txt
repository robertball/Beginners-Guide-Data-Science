I gave this 5 stars because it is a very good base. After reading reviews here is what I did. I cooked the rice & let it cool.  I then cooked the onion & garlic in the oil.  I added only shrimp, carrot, & peas.  Then I mixed the soy sauce in w/ the veggies. I stirred the mix into my cooled rice.  I then cooked 3 eggs in the same pan & chopped them up to bite size pieces & mixed them in.  I refrigerated the whole deal & just before dinner I heated it all up by frying it so that there was a little crunch.  It came out as good as our local  chinese place!

I stuck closely to the ingredients list, only omitting the green pepper as it didn’t appeal to me in fried rice. But I did change the cooking method quite a bit to produce a better result. For example, to add the carrots to the pan and cook them until crisp-tender when you’ve already got the cooked shrimp in the pan, you’d end up with some rubbery, overcooked shrimp! Also, fried rice should be started with cold, cooked rice.  So...I cooked the rice first, then spread it out on a cookie sheet and stuck in the fridge while I prepared the rest of the ingredients. I quickly stir fried the cold rice in the sesame oil, then the celery and onion, and finally the garlic (so it wouldn’t burn). To that I added the peas and the diced carrots, which I cooked ahead of time in the microwave.  As for the egg, I cooked it like a crepe in a small sauté pan, then rolled it up like a cigar and sliced it, chiffonade-style, very thinly, producing beautiful yellow ribbons of egg.  I tossed the egg in with the shrimp (I used frozen, pre-cooked salad shrimp), the chicken (already had some chopped rotisserie chicken in the freezer) and the ham (a pre-cut ham slice from the market came in real handy for this). Finally, I stirred in the soy sauce and a drizzle of toasted sesame oil. To die for.  The recipe suffers, however, from an instructed cooking method that does not bring out the best this recipe has to offer – therefore, four stars rather than the five it potentially deserves with a few changes.

First I never used recently cooked rice, i always use day old rice, which saves time. I also used SPAM, whenever I have it or cubed turkey bacon. I find that the flavors are much better for my taste. Also whenever I make fried rice, I always tend to layer my flavors with the ingredients.  So I start by cooking the eggs and then setting them a side. I then add a little oil to cook the spam or meat. I brown the meat slightly first, before removing it. Then i add onion and garlic, and slowly cook them, before adding the rice. I then cook the rice and the onion and garlic, so that the rice can absorb some flavor. I then add the veggies, and cook them slightly. At this point I add some taste, i use a little bit of soy and oyster sauce. I mix these a little bit more so that the flavors mix nicely. I then return the egg and spam to the pan. And then i mix them nicely together. After letting the flavors mix together, i end by adding a little bit of sesame oil. Only little bit though, you never want it to be stronger that anything else. I then finish by topping it with fresh green onions. And then it's done....

I've grown up to eat my fried rice this way, my dad always made if on the weekends for breakfast, it was always a treat. He would also make some eggs and spam and we'd have a full on breakfast. Even though it may have had a high cholestoral count. But this is super good....:-D

This is a very good recipe.  Fried rice is supposed to be a great way to get rid of leftovers.  So... to get the rice right... you do have to cook the rice first (preferably a day ahead), rinse it and chill it.  The rice should not be overcooked and needs to be chilled when making fried rice.  Also, the sesame oil is very powerful. I use only a teaspoon or two, along with regular oil.  In keeping the spirit of getting rid of leftovers add leftover bits of veggies or meats from the week.  I always add beansprouts.  Fresh is best, but I keep a can on hand just in case I can't get to the market.

In my opinion, shrimp must go to the mix after veggies are done.  If you start cooking onions first they will also be mushy by the time carrots are done.  So this is the order that Chinese chefs use - I looked at them cooking numerous times:  cook rice to half done, let it cool.  In the wok heat oil with garlic, add carrots and celery. If the oil evaporates during frying, add a bit of water for veggies not to dry or burn.  When veggies are almost crisp done, add shrimp and chopped scallions, soy sauce and a bit of hot sauce.  After shrimp is turned pink, stir in rice.  When rice is hot, stir in egg (uncooked!  not cooked like someone here mentioned yack!).  Oh, and it only takes 20-25 minutes to make for me, including chopping veggies.  Enjoy.

Out of all the recipes for fried rice I tried this one because I liked that it included sesame oil as an ingredient in addition to the soy sauce. I thought that would help for an authentic Asian flavor. Also, I like the flexibility factor of the ingredients. As recipe suggests, you can freely substitute for what you have on hand. I added scallions and garlic. And I used cut up beef hot dogs as the meat since it's all I had and I can't afford to use shrimp!! I omitted the celery since I don't often have it in my frig. I also made the rice a day ahead as I've heard is the best thing to do for fried rice. It came out very pretty to look at, and was very moist. My boyfriend says he would it eat "again & again" so I guess it's a keeper! The only thing I will do differently next time is possibly cut back on the soy sauce a little. Oh, one more thing...my boyfriend said it was better than his Mom's,  so I pretty much know that I've done something right! Thanks for the recipe!

There are several issues I had with this recipe.  Yes, technically, this is fried rice.  But, as has been stated in numerous other reviews, you should try to use rice that's left over, day old or longer.  It dries it out a little.  In a pinch, I have made rice, then spread it out onto a sheet pan and placed it uncovered in the refrigerator to dry for at least a few hours.  Certainly make sure you don't overcook the rice to begin with.  Another thing is that the shrimp gets very overcooked.  Cook it separately, remove it, add it back at the very end.  Sesame oil is not a cooking oil.  It's a seasoning oil. When subjected to high heat, it will burn easily.  And you should only use toasted sesame oil.  I add it with the soy sauce.  Fry with peanut, canola, or vegetable oil of some sort. Finally, there is no place in most average kitchens for medium-high or medium heat when stir frying.  Unless you have a very high output stove, (Almost nobody does at home) keep that burner on HIGH.  This is all supposed to be cooked as quickly as possible, searing and not steaming the food.  Don't overlook the recipe's suggestion to adjust the seasonings to taste.  Soy sauces vary in strength and salt content.  If the rice is too bland, add a splash of soy until it tastes right.  No salt is necessary because there's plenty in the soy sauce.  Black pepper is a must though.  Don't overcook the veggies and add some chopped green onions at the very end when you add the shrimp back to the rice.

I have tried many times to make fried rice and it has always turned out mushy and disappointing. This one was delicious though! The rice remained firm and it was a perfect amount of flavor with the onion, garlic and soy sauce. I omitted all meat and used onion, frozen peas and carrots and egg.

Excellent.  I delete the shrimp (and use 2C. total of ham and chicken) and add a can of waterchestnuts.

Well Lynda you've outdone yourself on this one. Excellent fried rice, better than my favorite Chinese restaurant! We loved this dish. The flavors meld nicely. I let my rice cooker do its magic on the rice, making a perfect base for this dish. Thanks for sharing. This will be a regular at our house.

This recipe makes delicious fried rice and is very easy to alter to use items that you have on hand.  I was looking for a way to use leftover pork tenderloin, so I substituted diced pork for all the meat items.  What little was left after dinner was eaten the next day for lunch.  I'll DEFINITELY make this again.

There is nothing wrong with the recipe. The great thing about it is that it works as it and also as a wonderful base recipe if your using what is on-hand or adjusting due to dietary needs.   I did not measure anything. I used chopped red onion, yellow & orange bell pepper, and baby portobello mushrooms. I omitted green peas, carrots, ham & chicken and had to substitute chopped garlic for minced (tube) garlic.   I warmed by wok first and then added sesame oil which I eyeballed; I ended up having to remove a good portion of it. I added the onions and then the mince garlic. Next went in the shrimp and mushrooms. Then I pushed everything against the walls of the wok to make a well to cook the egg. As the wok was regaining temperature, I added the yellow & orange peppers along the wall. I scrambled the egg and then added a few drops of the heated sesame oil I had to the side. Next, in went the [2 day old, restaurant] rice and I added a few shakes of soy sauce. I removed from burner and stirred in baby bok choy and continue to add sesame oil and soy sauce as needed.  This recipe made it seem like I could truly cook. I look forward to using it as a base recipe for future House Rice attempts. I completely forgot to add the bean sprouts which I think would have kicked this up a notch. Will also had some green onion next time.  This is a great recipe. I cannot understand some of the average reviews; your own bad deviations should not count against a solid recipe with good instructions.

The recipe is actually pretty good for a simple base House Fried Rice. However, I think serving refridgerated or cooled-down white rice is a lot better to cook with. Brown rice has its outer shell so it's harder for the soy sauce and other liquids to soak in it.

When you cook with freshly cooked fried rice, it's also harder for the rice to soak in the liquids you add, since it's already full of water. It will end up mushy.

The best way is to wait until you have day-old rice, or at least cooled down or refridgerated rice, that way the heat can easily take away the moisture in the rice so you can later replace it with soy sauce or other liquids.

Also another way to have perfect rice is to toss it. Professional chefs don't do that to make it look good, they toss it around to move the liquids and also not burn the rice, which is a lot better than stirring it around. But this technique is pretty much optional for the household, since not many people own a wok.

I loved it!!!! Quick. Here are a few corners I cut - I used the frozen mixed vegetables so I did not have to dice carrots and it also had other vegetables that my family loves such as corn, peas and green beans. I used roughly 2 cups. I let them thaw out. 
Also, since we like bean sprouts, I will add a few next time. Overall, we loved it and I will most definitely make this again.

I made some modifications based on the ingredients that I had at home and made it slightly healthier. I used the rice, 1/2 large onion, garlic, shrimp, ham, carrots, broccoli, and  egg, and ground pepper.

The recipe as is either winds up being over cooked rice or under cooked veggies depending on how long you let it go. Read tips from others and dont follow the instructions exactly. Also in my opinion this was way too much seasame oil it left me scrambling trying to disguise the overpowering flavor. Ginger and white wine vinegar helped if you need to disguise the seasame taste like I did. Overall recipe was not what I expected and I am left disappointed with overcooked rice to serve.

Do not mind doing extra work for a GREAT product.  I did not feel that this recipe was worth the work.  It is a LOT of chopping and there are easier fried rice recipes that do not require all the time, and quite honestly, taste better.

A meal unto itself. Added red cabbage, carrot, mushroom, pineapple & pork. Added five eggs because I love egg. Also added 2x more soy sauce for taste & moisture. Regretted not having bean sprouts. Leftovers with fresh fish tomorrow.

Great recipe! I used brown rice left out the onion peppers and peas but added bean sprouts and used just a couple tablespoons of low sodium soy sauce. I just added chicken but bet it is good with the other proteins. Yes, add the egg uncooked, it's an egg, it cooks in a minute. Mix the egg around to give it that authentic texture! This is a staple for dinner in my house and it's great for lunch leftovers!

Very delicious and easy!! My boyfriend went for seconds and asked for it the very next day! But he didnt have any because I ate the rest of it lol. Will be making it again tonight, this is a VERY good recipe. The only change I would make is the time for cooking the shrimp, it was overdone, so I would suggest cooking and adding the shrimp at the end

Looking for a way to use up leftover holiday ham and a few cups of finely diced veggies from another recipe....I found this! I used leftover white rice that was in the fridge and fried that up separately in some sesame oil, then tossed in the veggies that had been stir-fried in vegetable oil, the ham and  2 cooked eggs, then the soy. Wow, this tasted better than take out! 5 stars from everyone! Perfect!

This recipe was real easy and fast to make (especially if you cut everything up front).  I didn't measure anything and I added mushrooms and used frozen peas & carrots.  I didn't use the shrimp or ham (only because I didn't have them) but the day before we grilled jerk chicken so I diced that up.  I cooked everything in one pan and I did cook the garlic with the onions in the sesame oil.  Even my picky child loved it.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a very good recipe. You can cut down on your cooking time if you cook your meat ahead of time and use frozen vegetables. I used frozen vegetables so I added them in all at the same time. Choose your oil wisely. You don't want the rice to be too oily at the end. I bit the bullet and used olive oil mixed with the toasted sesame oil throughout the dish(healthier). As one reviewer stated the oil does disappear quickly. I omitted the chicken and in the future I would omit the ham as well. I think three different types of meat is over kill. I used the recommended one egg, but two would be fine as well. In the future I would try to keep my vegetables as fresh as possible, but it was still very good.

Too much leftover Chinese food rice? It's works well if you add some chicken broth - the liquid brings it back to life.

I hate to say this, but this is a terrible recipe.  Just to begin, how can this be fried rice, when the rice isn't fried?  Then, cooking shrimp and already cooked meats first and to continue cooking with the vegetables, makes no sense. There are other, much better recipes for fried rice on this site.

Two things stand out here which are troublesome:  1. the way the egg is mixed in.  2. the use of soy sauce.  Forget both.  Instead, scramble an egg in TOASTED sesame oil, set aside and chop when cooled.  Add into the mix at the end.  Also:  when rice is cooked, drizzle with TOASTED sesame oil and toss.  THIS IS WHAT FLAVORS FRIED RICE; THERE IS NO NEED TO ADD SOY SAUCE. If you want to make it look "fried", i.e., browned, do what the restaurants do:  sprinkle cooked, cooled rice with a bit of Gravy Master.  I kid you not. No one will know and they'll think that you actually fried it. I also keep my celery raw and sliced very thin.  This adds the crunch.

This was great. I made a few changes after reading the other reviews. First, I used instant rice, layed it out flat on a pan and let it cool. I then cooked the egg with a few dashes of sesame oil. Then set them aside. In the same pan, I added oil, sauteed  the onion with about 1-1/2 tspns sesame oil (the 3 tablespoons seemed overwhelming) until tender, then added half a bag of mixed veggies,sauteed a few more  minutes and added garlic. Added leftover chicken and ham. Sauteed a few more minutes then added the rice. About 2 cups. Drizzled the soy sauce and mixed well, then tossed in the egg. Great recipe.

In my family of varying palettes, this was a hit with all.  Easy to modify, as well.  I mixed the sesame oil with canola for a higher smoking point.  Also, after sauteing the meats and veggies, I removed them form the pan, added a bit more oil and fried the rice to give it a little crunch.  Then I whisked in the egg, added back the veggies and seasoned with the soy.  SO good!

This recipe is great and very easy to customize.  Usually, I use all chicken for the meat portion and for the veggies I add a 16 oz. bag of shredded cabbage and carrots with the onion, garlic, celery and green pepper.  I also use 2 eggs instead of 1 and jasmine rice.  This has become a family favorite over the past year.  Once I made a double batch, but beware if you try to double it: you need a really big pot to stir the rice and veggies together at the end! The only seasoning I add is black pepper when I cook the veggies.  As good or better than what you could order in a restaurant!

Versatile, easy and very tasty. Making the rice ahead of time makes a world of difference - not sticky and easy to mix in. I used leftover meat and just chopped up a nice variety of vegetables. This dish with a salad and we had a great meal! Must use the sesame oil -it's key!

I used about the same amount of meat and vegetables, but different ones. I first sauteed onion and cabbage in the sesame oil until just until they were translucent. Then I added half a bag of thawed salad shrimp, and let those warm up. Next, I added about 1-1/2 cups of frozen mixed vegetables, and sauteed until they were warm. Next came the egg. Last, I added 1-1/2 cups of cold, leftover rice, again sauteing until warm, after which I added the soy sauce and let everything heat through. I followed the order of the recipe and didn't have any problems with things being over- or undercooked, and it was ready in about 20 minutes, start to finish. Thanks for sharing this versatile recipe!

This is a great recipe! I use left over rice from the day before. I also only make it with chicken due to certain preferences (read a picky eater) at my house. And I usually use celery instead of bell pepper because I always have it on hand. I also prefer the petite frozen peas instead of the regular size ones. This has been added to my regular rotation of meals!

Not bad.  I picked this because it was relatively simple and I had 2 pork chops, peas, rice, and carrots I wanted to use.  I left out the chicken and shrimp just because I didn't really want to add any more meat.  I thought I didn't have celery until I checked the freezer and found some.  I loosely followed the directions--I had already cooked rice from a few days ago, so I used that, and I guess I tripled the recipe but did not add as much soy sauce as called for--I was worried about the sodium content.  An okay and relatively easy fried rice, and it went well with dumplings and egg rolls, but I think it needs a little more something, perhaps ginger.  I may try that next time.  thanks for the recipe!

Good basic fried rice recipe. I used rice that I had precooked and cooled earlier so it would have the right texture. I only had a little bit of onion and celery left and only used ham for the meat, I  doubled the egg, and used a frozen asian vegetable blend. I'll add more garlic next time and maybe a bit of ginger too. Thanks LMFB64, we enjoyed this meal.

This is better than restaurant fried rice!  I have made this a couple of times.  I always use smoked pork in place of ham (personally it tastes more authentic that way).  Also, I love soy sauce so I use waaaay more than the recipe calls for.  I have served this to friends and always get great reviews .. the last one was, "This is better than the Chinese store!"  Yes, he actually said "store."  I have used fresh cooked and leftove rice (jasmine), but didn't notice a difference.  I also add a little green onion.

Excellent--and so easy!  I could never get the right taste with other recipes-I think the sesame oil is the key.  P.S.-I wish people wouldn't make drastic changes then criticize the recipe-this is GREAT when made as directed.

This was very good.  I just used chicken and frozen peas and fresh carrots (which is what I had in the house)  Refrigerated the rice so it was cold.  Very yummy, will make again.

A bit greasy.  I used only pork chops (they were originally about 3" x 5" x 1.5", cubed and cooked) as meat and lots of vegetables.  I'll never add ham, but the chicken and *maybe* the shrimp will be tried in the future.  My husband and I really loved it.  It was very salty and we didn't feed it to our daughter.  We thought of tons of ways to make variations -- broccoli and cashews being the ones we'll try next.  It is a definite repeat recipe.  Eggs are not too overpowering.  That is a real plus!  This is a keeper.  The main thing with this one is to EXPERIMENT and go with what sounds tasty.  The recipe is so easy and versitile that it will be hard to go wrong!

Wow!  We loved this recipe - after two helpings my husband went back for more and even licked the spatula... now that's love.  I used Lite Soy Sauce and only 1/8 c not the full 1/4 c - we thought even at the reduced amount it was plenty salty.  We used up left over pork tenderloin and substituted broccoli for the green pepper and celery (those veggies didn't seem very "authentic") and used a full 1 c of peas.  This is a full meal in one dish - we will definitely be using this from now on.

Excellent rice! Went well as a side to our "crispy coconut chicken fingers," also found on this site!! Changes were minimal and only due to availabilty of ingrediants: I used 2 cups of rice and used chopped broccoli and fresh mushrooms instead of carrots and peas. Also, I scrambled the eggs (2) in a seperate pan. Very good and would make this dish again!  MMMMMM good! Thanks Lynda!

Excellent! I omitted the shrimp because I didnt have any and it was just as good as I imagine it would be with the shrimp. This is a great recipe for people, like me, who dont have a wok. It isnt necessary at all. Thanks so mcuh for sharing this delicious and super healthy meal.

What turned out well with this recipe was everything. We were able to finish cooking before our class was over. We changed the regular white rice to whole grain rice and it still tasted great. But if i did make the recipe different I would have made it with regular white rice instead of using the whole grain rice because I wasn't as use to the taste and texture of whole grain rice. The final product looked like many of the pictures that were posted on the website. Yes i would recommend this to someone else because the final product turned out better than I thought it would.

Great  basic recipe. Family loved it! I fried the scrambled eggs first then set aside, then fried the garlic & onion. Threw in celery till just had a crunch left in it. added a cup of mixed frozen peas/carrots/corn. Then tossed in the shrimp, chicken, ham, left-over cooked rice, egg...it didn't turn out crunchy but very hearty.

Very good!  It's the sesame oil that does it - and you can throw in anything you have around - I used pancetta, green onions, and zucchini - and my whole family loved it.  A keeper.

Very good recipe.  Cold leftover rice works well in this.  As the author says, it's easy to substitute ingredients according to what you have on hand.  Be sure to use two ribs of celery, not two stalks (a stalk is the large bunch you purchase at the store -- it says "one stalk" right on the bag).

I'm still searching for a way to get restaurant-style fried rice at home.  This wasn't it.  This recipe is totally bland and flavorless.  I usually don't change a recipe the first time I make it, but I wish I'd added ginger and rosemary.  There was one positive thing I got from this recipe, and that was using day old rice.  It got the texture one step closer.  But still, this needs flavor.

What a great way to use leftover chicken! In addition to more seasonings and low salt soy sauce I used green onions and two eggs. Hubby's not a huge rice fan, but he and the kids loved this quick meal. Thanks Lynda!

This recipe was great, I didn't add any meat, just the vegetables and it was still very good.  I froze my cooked rice before mixing it in with the vegetables and it made the rice less "pasty".

Awesome, awesome awesome. Only need to change one thing, use day old rice. I Added both beef and chicken, thinking about adding shrimp to the dish. This is sooooo great. Tried and cooked recipes all over the web. This is the best.

The rice should be cold before it's added. Otherwise it will be mushy and won't want to separate. I also believe the meat should go in after the veggies. Anybody ever tried Chinese Five Spice? Go easy, it's strong. Good recipe!

This is a good recipe. The only changes I made were cooking the rice in vegetable stock and using Basmati rice. I like the "sticky" rice texture you get when ordering fried rice from a restaurant and the Basmati closely resembles that. You can also use jasmimne rice for the same taste/texture.

My local take-out place makes the best "house fried rice" I have found. The one flaw in this recipe is that to avoid the oil soaking into the rice, the rice should be kept in the fridg overnight. FRY the rice in the oil, then add ingredents.

Very good, thanks for the ideas! I scrambled 3 eggs, set aside. Cooked white rice, put in fridge to cool off some.  Sauteed mushrooms/onion/garlic/teriyaki sauce in frying pan. Cooked diced ckn in another frying pan with garlic/teriyaki sauce, added pineapple after ckn was cooked. Added the rice and egg to the mushroom/onion mixture, along with some soy sauce.  Served the ckn over the rice, came out pretty good for a spontaneous meal! Next time I wanna marinade the ckn beforehand so more flavor is absorbed into it.

This recipe has become a favorite at our house. Changing the vegetable ingredients (such as adding in chopped green onions, broccoli, water chestnuts, or been sprouts) and marinating the meat in different sauces gives it a fresh look and taste every time but it is all good. Add some egg rolls or fried wontons and you've got a meal!

Solid 4. Really good. I used black forest ham as the only meat, and I think next time I need to use BBQ asian pork, chicken, or something else.

Very good. I was afraid there was too much soy sauce, but it was very balanced. Love that you can fix it with whatever veggies and meat you have around the house. Makes great leftovers!

This was a perfect base recipe! I used a package of frozen veges for colour and it presented well, and tasted amazing. I can't wait to try the left-overs! Very simple and easy to make, even my two year old daughter was able to help, much to her delight. I omitted the shrimp and chicken and didn't miss them. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe- Cooked brown rice 2 hours before and placed in freezer. I added fish sauce and ginger, did the same as others and cooked the meat/fish and vegetables seperately.

Everyone loved it!

I found this to be a mushy Fried Rice recipe. Not that it tastes bad, just has an odd texture for fried rice. Most recipes use sesame oil as a flavoring because of the relative low smoking point. I use 2-3 Tbs peanut oil in my wok to stir fry all the ingredients separately..Heat 1 Tb peanut oil, fry the onion remove, put the garlic through a press, fry 30 secs, Add another Tb  peanut oil, stir fry the shrimp 2 mins , remove.  Stir fry veggies ( I use snow peas), remove. Add oil as necessary for rice. Stir fry cooked,cooled rice ( I use 4 cups, so if you are using 3 cups of rice, you may want to reduce the oil). Add 1 Tsp sesame oil and  1/4 c soy sauce. Stir to blend. Add back the cooked foods and the chicken (I don't use ham, but if you were adding it this is the time to add it) Stir to blend and heat through.

Absolutely amazing! I used low sodium soy sauce and grated the carrots instead of chopping.  Also, make sure you chop up the chicken, shrimp and ham into very small pieces. That way you get a little of everything in each bite! I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and made sure the rice was cold before mixing in the other ingredients. This recipe was really unbelievable! Make it!

This was pretty good,but not exactly like the fried rice from a chinese restaurant.I made it with just veggies,no shrimp or meats.At the end I added 1/2 a packet of "fried rice seasoning mix" which helped add a bit more flavor.Also next time I will add 3 eggs instead of 1.

A versital recipe.  I really like my version.  For health problems, I will always omit the ham and use either shrimp or chicken, and use low-sodium soy sauce.  Thanks for posting this recipe.

I would give this zero stars however that isn't an option.  My brother cooks for a Chinese restaurant and my cousin owns one so I feel that I have some credibility when it comes to taste-testing fried-rice.

A very good start to fried rice, though I felt it needed to be sparked up a little. I bumped into some Chinese sausage (Lup Chong) at the market, so I substituted that for the ham and tossed in some straw mushrooms that were on sale, also. Peanut oil maybe a better choice for the stir fry and finish with a little sesame oil, so the flavors arn't masked, but hightened. In the future, I would add the onions later in the stir fry so there is a little onion ‘spark’ to the finished product. I added fresh minced ginger and more garlic than called for. I finished the stir fry with a little sherry (though rice wine would have been more traditional). I agree with Lynda that this begs for leftovers tossed in that would be appropriate as this is a traditional way to use up extra ingredients in such an Asian dish. Thanks Lynda!

This was VERY tasty!  I would definately recommend cooking the rice the night before and pushing aside the meat/veggies when you pour the egg in to ensure that it will cook properly.  I used Tamari sauce in place of regular soy sauce and felt that 1/4 cup was the perfect amount.

Wow. My husband and I decided to make this simply to use our leftover Easter ham. However after trying it we've decided that we can't just wait until we have leftover meat to make this - it's too good to wait for those sporadic times! We both kept saying "Wow" as we ate. We used 2 1/2 cups of honey ham. Next time we'll try chicken. Basically, you can't go wrong with this recipe. It's going on my FAVORITES list!

EXTREMELY GOOD!  I truly love the way you can substitute for what you have or just what you prefer!  I've tried several ways of making fried rice(even tried Uncle Ben's) and came up with losses everytime.  A true winner in my book!

I worked 10 years in a Chinese Restaurant and the rice is best when it is chilled. Also if you rinse the rice before you boil it, it rinses some of the starch out of the rice. If you use it hot it will get starchy and sticky.  Chill in fridge for at least 1 hour then proceed with the recipe. Hope this helps.

I didn't think there was much flavor going on here...I added a bunch of veggies and fried tofu, but I would prefer there was a more flavorful sauce, rather than just soy.

Don't saute with sesame oil. Use veg oil and add a bit of sesame oil into the rice mix for flavor. Like other reviewers advised, use cold rice.

4 stars on taste, 5 stars on flexibility. You can freely substitute for what you have on hand - in my case i added green onions and corn. Personal preference i would omit green peppers cut down the amount of celery and then add a little more soy sauce. Overall a very good recipe that requires little effort.

This is great as it is really adjustable to what is  in the fridge....I made mine veggie only since I wanted it as a side dish for a seafood dish I already had. Only thing I changed : it lacked a bit of "depth" of flavor...I added a little ginger and 2 tsp of oyster sauce to it/much better!

This was really tasty although I did modify somewhat based on what I had on hand and at the recommendation of other reviewers.  I omitted the chicken, celery and green pepper because I didn't have any.  I substituted olive oil for the sesame oil and Turkey bacon for the ham.  I had medium frozen shrimp that I ran under cold water to defrost and coarsely chopped. I premade my rice earlier in the day as well.  I also changed the cooking order, I chopped the turkey bacon and fried it for 3 - 4 minutes, then added 1 - 2 tbs olive oil, added the onions and carrots and sauteed until crisp / tender about 5 minutes, added the garlic, sauteed another 2 minutes, made a well in the middle of the pan and added 3 eggs, put the peas and shrimp around the perimeter of the pan to heat up while cooking the eggs. When the eggs were partially set (about 3 minutes) I stirred everything in together.  I then added the soy sauce and a HEALTHY dose of Worcestershire sauce (since I was slightly low on Soy Sauce) and salt and pepper.  When this was mixed well and heated through I stirred in the rice and heated for another couple of minutes.  Turned out FABULOUS!!!

Good base recipe, it can easily be turned into a vegetarian dish, and depending on what is in your fridge, substitutions are easy too (this time I put white cabbage instead of celery, great crunch!)

Not bad, but not great. I find that the best fried rice I make at home starts with the steamed rice I get at the restaurant. It makes perfect fried rice each time.

In the water for rice, add soy sauce and sesame oil, then cook following package directions.  Fix scrambled eggs separately and set aside. Saute diced green onions, shredded carrots, peas, any other veggies and meat [we prefer just diced ham] in about 2 tablespoons of bacon grease.  Stir all ingredients together and enjoy.

This recipe came out good with some changes to suit our tastes.  We used leftover rice as others suggested and it worked well.  We doubled the recipe but used 3 eggs instead of just 2.  We also added in some cilantro for extra flavor, replaced the peas with bean sprouts and used only shrimp (small ones) for the meat.  The rice came out tasty and we liked it better than what we find in the restaurants.

I feel as if I just picked up my fried rice from a resturant!  I did some things different.  I did cook my rice the day b4. I did use 3 meats, and added baby bella mushrooms and added peapods in stead.  When I was cooking I cooked the onion and the garlic then I added my veggies 1st!  Cooked the veggies then added all my meat ( I used already cooked shrimp) then after I had all of that together that is when I added my rice and soy sauce! Just awsome! Was hoping for leftovers but I even doubled the recipe and not a bit left!

I think this dish would have been equally delicious just as written but due to using what I had at home and catering to pickiness I altered it slightly. I used 1 tbsp veg. oil & 2 tbsp hot chili oil which gave a nice oriental spice flavour. I used 2 green onions, celery, cooked shrimp, diced deli bought chicken, 1/2 green pepper, 1 diced carrot which I parboiled for 4 min. 1/4C soy sauce and about 2 cups of cold cooked white rice.You may want to use low-sodium soy sauce if you prefer a less salty taste. No one complained here though. I followed the directions as written. Wow! Does this ever make your kitchen smell yummy! I overheard some children playing outside asking where that "good food smell" was coming from. This is an easy quick and quick to clean up recipe that I will continue to make in the future.

I loved this recipe because of it's variations.  I'm not a big meat eater, and my husband hates bell peppers, so I changed a few things.  I agree with others that you must use the sesame oil!!!!  It was the best fried rice ever. My husband added additional soy and some hot sauce to his, I ate mine just the way it was prepared!  
Many, Many thanks for a great recipe!

Very good recipe, taste just like when you go out and have chinese.  The only change that I made was I cooked the rice the day before and let it get cold in the fridge so that it wouldn't fall apart when you went to stir fry it.  Makes a big difference.

Who knew fried rice was actually healthy??  This was really yummy too!  I made the following changes:  brown rice instead of white; only 2 tablespoons of sesame oil plus one tablespoon of olive oil (I was worried it'd be too sesame-y); green onion instead of white; 2 cloves of garlic; 5 oz pre-cooked shrimp; 8 oz ham; 8 oz bag of frozen peas and carrots - no other vegetables; 2 eggs.  After the rice was finished, and before I cooked anything else, I put the rice in a collander, ran it under cold running water, and tossed the whole thing into the freezer.  That way, the rice had plenty of time to cool before the final step, as suggested by other reviewers.  Also, when it came time to cook the egg(s), I pushed the rest of the ingredients to the sides of the wok, and cooked the eggs for a bit in the center before mixing it in. By using pre-cooked shrimp and frozen veggies, this dinner came together so quickly.  I absolutely loved it and will definitely make it again!

Yummy! Four stars only because of my changes. Good basic recipe. Used sauce from Marian Collins "Baked Teriyaki Chicken" on this site in place of soy sauce, since many complained too salty. Added bag of frozen stir fry veggies instead of others listed. Also cook rice in morning or night before and refrigerate until needed. Rave reviews from family!!

This was good, but it had way too much soy sauce.  I think next time I'll just put it in a little bit at a time or none at all and let people put their own on it.  I mixed in some XO Sauce I found at a local china market to give it a spicy kick.  I also made the rice the day before (cooked in chicken broth) and used two eggs.

One thing I've always hated about fried rice is that the egg seems overwhelming in it.  This recipe did not have that problem at all.  Perfect proportions, and I love the versatility of ingredients that can be added.  We'll definitely be making this one again!

Wonderful recipe, I made this a vegetarian dish by omitting the meat and I did not add the green pepper or celery. I also added a little olive oil. Thanks for a great find. We will be using this recipe alot.

WOW!!  I will never enjoy fried rice in a resturant again knowing that I am missing this!  We LOVED it!  I tripled the recipe and it was still all gobbled up!  For the meats I used chicken with teriaki sauce and boneless pork glazed with chinese red sauce (ah-so sauce)  I just baked them both in the oven together earlier in the day.  I made the white rice at this time also.  I changed the veggies a bit to my families liking.  It was a snap to whip together at dinnertime.  Now whenever I make any meats the leftovers go right in the freezer for next time I make this!

Made this tonight and had to force myself not to get seconds! Great way to use up leftover Easter ham. Really good, but I can't wait to try it with some of the suggestions from others as well...ginger, oyster sauce, scallions at the end. I'd also suggest some chopped water chestnuts for crunch. For fried rice, it's always best to make the rice earlier in the day or the day before so that the kernels separate. Really looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow! Thanks, Lynda!

An excellent dish!  Everyone loved it, including my 20-month old son.  
I left out the ham (didn't have it on hand), increased the chicken and used canned shrimp. (I wouldn't recommend the canned shrimp but it worked in a pinch.)  
Also, after cooking the meat, I removed it from the pan to saute the vegetables and added it back later and heated it through.  Next time I would probably saute the vegetables first and then add the meat to cook.

Excellent way to use up leftover Easter ham. I omitted the shrimp and chicken and used three cups of diced ham. Next time I will probably use more garlic and onion than called for in the recipe. Very good!

Authentic and excellent!  I do agree that the shrimp should be added last for them to remain firm.  Very enjoyable dish!

This was very good.  We doubled the recipe to accommodate the amount of shrimp and chicken we had (did not use ham), but that was a mistake... it made entirely way too much food.  We had to cook the rice in a giant soup pot which is where we did our final stir-together... a mountain of food!  We ate with chopsticks which made it fun for the kids.

this came out super good.. i used day old rice, leftover grilled chicken, turkey ham which i fried before adding, precooked the veggies, used half a yellow bell pepper instead of green as 1 whole sounded a bit much, 3 medium sized eggs which i precooked before adding in, doubled the garlic, cut up my shrimp as they were on the big side, only used 2 T sesame oil.. ty for the recipe

Was very good, but tasted like something was missing. Next time I will add a bit of brown sugar as suggested by another user and see if that fills the hole. Thank you for the starter recipe!

My main problem for with this recipe was the overpowering taste of the sesame oil. It overtook all the other flavors.  I may back it down to half (or less)  and then mix in vegetable oil.  I also used some of the other reviewers tips on using cold rice.  Very good recipe just needs a couple of tweaks.

Perfect recipe for fried rice! It turned out great using freshly cooked rice (a big time saver) and even frozen veggies. Perfectly flavored for our family! I used meat and veggies I had on hand (ham, chicken, frozen broccoli, celery) and omitted peppers, peas, and shrimp. I just dumped in the chopped broccoli frozen and it cooked to perfection. It's such a flexible recipe. I also used 2 eggs.

This was just okay to me. It seemed like it still needed something, but I'm not sure what. I pretty much made as directed except added a couple dashes of ground ginger for a little extra flavor, and a few water chestnuts because we had some open and on hand. If I made again, I would definitely be making some alterations.

I  L-O-V-E  this recipe!  My entire family is allergic to shellfish, so naturally we didn’t use the shrimp.  But the options for this dish are nearly endless!  I made it according to the recipe (minus shrimp) and added water chestnuts and beansprouts at the very end (just long enough to warm them through).  Served with eggroll and a fortune cookie I felt like I’d just left our favorite Asian restaurant.  Yummmm!  Thank you, LMFB64!

LOVED IT! I'm just learning how to cook and tried this last night.... made enough for 6 but my boyfriend loved it so much there weren't any left overs! I did change it up a bit though. I added the onions and garlic then some uncooked chicken and let it cook. Then the veggies, shrimp, rice, and soy sauce. It was a little too salty so next time I just won't add as much soy sauce. Other than that it was great!

This dish is tasty - a Chinese "vegetable rice" kicked up a notch with meats. I use either Japanese soy or Chinese light (not "lite" = low sodium) soy rather than "dark", and I cut back on the roasted sesame oil. Otherwise the dish is too heavy in flavor. As for the celery: I use stalks when I want crunch, leaves when I want more bouquet. Strange as it sounds, I sometimes include water chestnut, jicama or GSmith apple, especially if the meats are chicken, ham, Chinese sausage and/or char sieu (barbecued pork).

This is delicious!  Bonus was I made it with everything I happened to have on hand.  Used leftover shrimp, chicken and broccoli.  Didn't have ham or peas.  I think you can get by with what you happen to have.  I eyeballed the amount of soy sauce and used some olive oil with about 1 tsp of sesame oil and then sprinkled some more sesame oil on as I finished cooking it.  Very good!

Excellent flavor, restaurant quality. I followed the advice of others and only used 1/2 the amount of sesame oil and combined it with vegetable oil. Cooked the rice the night before and chilled it in the fridge. Cooked everything in layers, first the veggies (broccoli, red pepper, carrots), put aside. Then the shrimp and the ham, then added the veggies and rice, then cooked the egg and seasoned it with soy sauce. That's it. Fast, easy and delicious!

My healthified version:
I'm losing weight and my parents are diabetic, so I modify the recipe this way to make it healthier:

I make it with cooked brown rice, which I always have in the freezer.

I use TONS of shrimp, chicken, ham.  I get raw, tail on, medium shrimp frozen at wal-mart for between 6-7 dollars a bag. 

I use TONS of veggies - onions, garlic, mushrooms, broccoli, celery, and zuchini.  I put in water chestnuts if I have them.  

I use a very small amount of carrots, peas, and brown rice. I steam the carrots and peas (one carrot cubed, and about 2 THBSP. frozen peas)  separately.  I put in a small quantity mostly for the color.  I measure out 1/2 cup of cooked brown rice per serving.  

I brush the non-stick pan with sesame oil, rather than pouring a whole bunch in.  

I cook the onions, garlic, and veggies first.  If I remember I throw in chopped ginger root, too.  

Then I take them out of the pan.  

I brush on a little more oil, and I put the reduced sodium soy sauce to taste, on the other veggies and fry them.    I take them out of the pan.

I beat two eggs with a little soy sauce and pinch of sugar, brush the pan and cook it like a really flat omelet and then cut it into strips.

I brush the pan again, add some garlic powder, and stir fry everything on high, adding reduced sodium soy sauce to taste.

I can serve this to my family with a good conscience - it's healthy AND delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is the first fried rice recipe I made that my dd ate without complaining.  Even my 2 yr old ds ate his.  I changed up the veggies based on what I had (mushrooms for peppers, white & green onion) but didn't compromise the recipe.  Thank you for sharing what will be made often at my house!

I loved the home made taste to this! I added extra vegetables to make it more healthy and cut on the oil. Using a wok helped me.

This was very good fried rice.  It's a lot of work, just like all Oriental dishes are, in having to cut and chop things but it was worth it.  I pretty much followed the hints given by 2tee on April 20, 2007.  I only used ham and shrimp,used a red pepper instead of green, added bean sprouts and used edamame instead of peas.  I always add more garlic than any recipe calls for and I did not use celery.   I would say it needs more than 1/4c. soy sauce with all of that rice.  I also used some oyster sauce and topped it with green onions before serving.  Oh, I used 3 eggs too.  Cooking them first and then setting them aside and cutting them in strips, works very well!  The leftovers are great for lunch at work.  Thanks for the recipe.

Left out the pepper and used two eggs. Also used short grain brown rice that I made the night before and let sit in the fridge. Best eaten out of the pan over the stove after already having seconds!

This was fabulous!!! I followed the majority of the recipe, but I made it with chicken only and since I didn't have enought sesame oil, I mixed what I had with wok oil, used frozen mixed veggies instead of celery, carrots and green peppers, I added ground ginger and sesame seed.  I only wished I had bamboo shoots and water chestnuts to add.  This cured my craving for restaurant Chinese!!  Wish it had more stars. Everyone loved it!! Thanks for a great recipe. YUM...

I made this with the shrimp & chicken and a few different veggies, and it was delicious.  A few days later, I was looking for a side dish and made it with broccoli and shredded carrots and no egg...again - delicious!  Great rice pilaf!  Just follow the directions and add or omit any veggies that you like.

Suggestions:  Cook eggs first separately in a flat omelet with salt and cut into strips, then short strips.  Use cold leftover short-grain rice. Skip the soy sauce altogether.  Use regular cooking oil.

Woo Hoo! I finally found a fried rice recipe I like. This is perfect for leftover meats.  I add some sesame seeds towards the end for a little extra flavor. I really like A LOT of scrambled egg in my fried rice so I think next time I'll add at least 3.  I used 2 and it didn't seem like enough.  Customize this recipe to your hearts content!

Basically very good and wasy. I made as written but my personal tastes like it a little spicier so will add something next time but this was very good. Will make again.

I am so glad I found this recipe.  My family loves fried rice, but I didn't know how to make it.  This recipe was so easy.  I usually have cooked rice left over, so this worked out wonderfully.  Now we don't have to get take out any more.

This was really good.  I made a vegetarian version of this substituting extra vegetables for the meat.  I followed the advise of another reviewer to add oyster sauce, and I added a couple of tablespoons of veggie oyster sauce.  Great recipe and will make again.  The addition of sesame oil is great too.

I copied out the recipe, but once I got going i didn't even follow it. I just threw things in until the ratio looked good... and it worked, tasted great! I think the concept is to use whatever you have on hand. I used ham, but you could use chicken, pork, prawns, bacon... whatever is leftover! Also, I used 2 eggs, capcicum (or pepper :P), peas and plenty of oil to coat the rice. Then you add the soy sauce til it looks/tastes good. The trick is to use cooked rice that has been refridgerated first, it really makes a difference! This is really a goof proof recipe, and a nice change from the conventional salad/veg side dishes!

Excellent. I added some chopped cabbage, sugar snap peas, and left out the peppers. However, next time instead of browning the minced garlic with the onion, I am going to add the garlic to the pan right before adding the rice. I think it will bring out the true authentic fried rice taste better that way.

I would've made the recipe exactly as written except that I didn't have all the ingredients -- I had to use olive oil in place of the sesame and a little celery salt instead of actual celery.  Additionally, I used one lb. of shrimp rather than the various meats called for (because the only meat my daughter eats is seafood).  That said, WOW.  This is delicious.  I'll definitely make it again.  Incidentally, I had to use my largest skillet and still it was filled to capacity.  Yum -- I could eat it all by myself.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Super fantastic... For meat, I used only chicken (2 boneless breasts) which I'd cubed and sauteed in a little sesame oil and tamari with a tsp of garlic.  I could have just eaten the chicken by itself, but it was amazing in this rice!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but did add a couple pinches of GINGER, which I thought add a nice kick.  Also added red bell pepper- great for color- and a 6 oz can of mushrooms.  Soooooo good and authentic tasting... thank you for submitting!!!

Using the 3 Tbsp of sesame oil is what makes this recipe work.  I ended up also buying a bag of mized frozen vegetables, heated them up in boiling water, and then drained them.  Used all shrimp and if I did this over, I would use 2 eggs vs 1.  It's still not as good as the fried rice I've had in China (their's is super light and fluffy), but this recipe is my go to in the US.

Very good recipe. We really enjoyed it. Thank you to the other reviewers who suggested to cook the rice the night before and to cut back on the soy sauce. We did both and the dish turned out great.

I changed it a little since Im such a picky eater and it still came out VERY VERY good., first off, make the rice the day or 2 before leave in fridge uncovered overnight, so that its a little bit stale/dry, then to the recipe,  I add 1 tbs peanut oil,a little more ham , and chicken, doubled the garlic  and added 1/3 cup babycorns (chopped), 1/4cup water chestnuts (diced) 1/4 cup bamboo shoots, cut lengthwise,  took out the shrimp and bellpeper since i cant stand those two things, cut soysause down to 4 tbs and it came out PERFECT! KUDOS to you on a good recipe!

Winner! This rice dish was outstanding. I only used chicken and it tasted exactly like the Chicken Fried Rice I get when I do Chinese take-out. I have tried making fried rice before, and never could get that authentic taste until this. The sesame oil is the trick. I am getting ready to heat up leftovers for my breakfast!! Sounds crazy, but I just can't wait! Thank you Lynda. It was wonderful.

Great, easy and fast. Sometimes the simplest meals are the best. I used celery, green pepper, sweet onion and garlic and because I served it to my 2 y.o's i cooked all veggies together before adding 1# shrimp. Then I added a package of precooked brown rice and shitake mushrooms we had picked up. I decreased the amount of soy sauce and used 2 eggs.

tasty, quick, versatile.To make it healthier I use brown rice. Try Trader Joes brand, it is the only brown rice my husband will eat, tasts like nuts(just like him-HA!) I use tamari sauce instead of soy. cook up 3 egg whites into a thin omlette, chop it up for the top, also add tons of what ever veggie I have,an inch of minced ginger, mung sprouts and nuts if I have them. my family eats up all the veggies (even greens) this way.I soak the tofu in sesame oil while I'm chopping the veggies, then bake them or just throw it into the mix as is. YUM

This was really good, but still a lot of prep work even if using leftovers. Only changes were to cook the rice a day ahead in chicken broth, used two eggs & added 1 tbsp hoisin sauce. Fairly healthy w/ all the veggies and protein. My husband thought it was 10 stars, but he didn't have to chop everything!

This was really excellent, and I've made quite a bit of fried rice in my day :-)
I didn't have chicken so I doubled the shrimp, and I left out the green pepper and added more celery.  
It was delicious.  I made the rice about an hour before I started the frying, and put it into the freezer on a big plate to cool off. I drizzled it with Sesame oil before serving for a little extra flavor.  
This made it perfect.  Loved this recipe. Thanks!

Snaps for Lynda! Its not often I find a recipe that all my kids like. This one did the trick. I cooked the rice in chicken broth and fridged it all day. I used 2 chicken breasts, lots of celery, 1/2 an onion and 1 bag of peas.I actually saw them go back for seconds. This is a dish you can't mess up because any veggies or meat will work. This is a definite keeper!!!

I used brown rice and left-over turkey in place of all the meat.  I didn't have all the fresh veggies on hand, so used frozen peas and carrots.  Worked great.

Great basic recipe with lots of versatility.  I made my rice before so it was cold when I made the dish but it was overcooked and made the dish mushy.  I am going to try it again with properly cooked brown rice and if that doesn't work I will move on to the white.  It still tasted great...you can't mess it up.

Yummy but takes time!  I think I'll add more soy sauce next time.  This time, I added a  small can of water chestnuts and I made the rice ahead so that it could chill and be more managable as a reviewer suggested.  I don't know if that was necessary, but it seemed easy to mix.  I was skeptical of the ham but added it anyway, and it tasted great.  This is a keeper.

This recipe was very good. I used pork (instead of the other meats listed), added a little pepper and didn't add celery. It's a very quick and easy fried rice recipe.

A good overall fried rice. The meats and veggies can be varied to what ever you have on hand but the steps and technique of the recipe are good. Adding the rice last and using cold leftover rice helps to prevent the rice from being over-cooked and mushy. I only use 1/2 sesame and 1/2 regular oil, or it is too strong for us. I also add a bit of ginger helped to give it a little kick.

This recipe was great!  I did it to use up left over white rice, used what I had, olive oil instead of sesame oil and the veggies I had in the fridge and it turned out good!  My fussy husband even went for a second serving!

I'd never made fried rice before.  I used leftover chicken from last night's roast sticky chicken/rotissery-style from this website.  Cut the rice recipe in half, and did everything else according to recipe, minus the peppers (didn't have any), and plus chopped broccoli and cauliflower.  Also substituted half the sesame oil for peanut oil (toasted sesame oil flavor too strong; peanut oil will cook at a higher temp than some other oils such as canola).  Also used low-sodium soy sauce, and used half the amount because I'm not a huge fan of soy sauce, but did want some.  Since this dish made up my entire dinner, I wanted a little pizzazz, so after serving, I stirred in a little "chili pepper water" from the Hula Grill on Maui.  It is hot and a little sweet, and jazzed it up just right for me tonight.

Delicious!  I tried a vegetarian version of this quick, tasty recipe.  We didn't have any garlic cloves in the house so I used a bit of garlic powder.  It turned out very tasty!

this was a good base for making fried rice. i thought it was a little lacking and next time i believe some oyster or fish sauce may make all the differance. i too didnt think 1 egg was enough, and i added mine at the end. the fact that oil wasnt left at the bottom, of my bowl as opposed to store bought fried rice was a big winner for me.

My family and I thought that the fried rice was pretty good and will be making it again.  I think the recipe is a good foundation for adding things depending on the preference of the cook (cilantro, bean sprouts, green onions, various oils, etc...).

OMG, this was great and really easy!!  I love pork fried rice and so excited that I can now make it by myself:)  I used only diced cooked pork for the meat and added more egg that I scrambled ahead of time.  (Basically used my experiences as Japanese restaurants to determine what should go in when.)  Also, I didn't find the Sesame oil at the store, so just used my olive oil at home and it was great.  I will definitely be making this again!!

This gets 4 stars as a next-day left over lunch, but only 2.5 stars as my dinner last night.  To be fair, I did change up the recipe a little - I used tons of diced veggies (broccoli, water chestunts, carrots, sugar snap peas, celery and zucchini) and shrimp with no other meat.  I also used basmati rice and light soy sauce, and added a little ginger.  It's pretty good (much better the second day) and pretty healthy as I prepared it, but not as close to Chinese take-out as I'd hoped.

This recipe has definite possibilities.  I would agree that the rice needs to be chilled first.  Mine was mushy because I didn't chill it.  Also, I would increase the eggs, but also cook them separately, then add them.  I will make again with these changes.

We found it a little bit bland.  Much better after adding oyster sauce!  Also, we used peanut oil (better for high temps), pork, ham and shrimp.  Yum!  And it needed more egg - I used two, but think three would have been better.

This is a great recipe because you can substitute so many things, and it comes out yummy just the same!   Next time, I think I'll increase the amount of eggs to 2 instead of 1.  I made more rice (2 cups instead of 
1  1/2), but that did not seem to be a problem.  It got a thumbs way up from my family!

This was just so-so.  We nixed the peas, carrots, celery, and all the meats except ham.  The Chinese places we frequent never have those items in there.  We left in the green pepper but next time if we make this we will not as that did not really do anything for the taste.  We did add bean sprouts, scallion, and ginger root.  Those additions gave this a more Asian flair.   I see this recipe gets 5 stars from most people and that is fine.  I am giving this a three because really there was nothing special about it.  I do not know of any combination-fried rice – and that is what this would be with all the meats this recipe calls for, that have peas, carrots, celery, and green pepper.   

We might stick to take out for this sort of rice.   Sorry.

Yum Yum Yum! First time I made this, I ate half the pan. Literally. I didn't have ham or bell pepper. I made it with brown rice and I eat a bowl every day...and I have shed a couple of pounds doing it! You can't beat that!

This was delicious--definitely as good as any fried rice I've had.  Next time though, I will reduce uncooked rice to one cup though.  I put the rice in the refrigerator to cool before adding it to the batch.  Also, I went ahead and fried the egg ahead of time, then set it to the side until it was time to add it. Great and versatile recipe!

This was delicious!  My husband asked me where I got it from.  Fried rice is the only kind he will eat and he liked this.  I used Uncle Ben's converted rice made in the microwave according to package directions.  I used peanut oil but next time I will try the sesame. It came out perfect.

This fried rice had great flavor.  I did make some changes -- used frozen raw shrimp as the only meat, and frozen peas and fresh carrots for the vegetables.  While frying the garlic, I added some slices of fresh ginger and the chopped white part of a bunch of scallions.  At the end, after removing the rice from the burner, I added the chopped green part of the scallions and tossed the whole thing to mix the flavors.  Next time I think I'll try cooking the frozen peas separately and then adding them rather than frying them with the fresh vegetables (they were a little mushy).  Great recipe!

This tasted even better the next day.  In fact, I probably would have just given it 4 stars if I hadn't had some leftovers for lunch today before writing this review.  I loved the flavor of the rice.  The changes I made were: I added 1 tablespoon of oyster sauce to the soy sauce, I used butter instead of sesame oil (they always fry the rice in butter at teppenyaki restaurants), I substituted pork steak for the chicken, I omitted the bell pepper and shrimp, put in some spinach(I know that sounds weird) and added an extra egg.  My kids didn't rave about it, but they didn't complain, either, so that's always a plus.  I served it with egg flour soup and it was a complete meal.

This was good.  I added some gourmet sauce and used a bit more soy sauce.  My husband had seconds and thanked me for making something "different".  I think when I make this again I will not cook the rice separately.  I'll put it all together the same and cook it on top of the stove for 10 minutes and then bake it at 350 for 30 minutes.  That's how I do my other rice dishes and I like the way the ingredients "gel" better.

This was really good. Used leftover Christmas turkey as the only meat.  I had to add a little more soy sauce for the flavour we like, but overall very yummy

Very good recipe and gives you room for using leftovers as chicken and beef and yellow corn. For best result use cold cooked rice, so make the rice the day before or in morning.Garnish plate with green onion sliced lenghtwise upper part

This was a really good recipe. I agree with it being too salty for my taste. Either cutting down the amount of soy sauce or using the low sodium one would really help. You can change this recipe around how ever you want by using different meats and veggies! Thanks for this recipe.

This was OK.  I thought it needed some more seasoning though.  My husband added more soy sauce at the table.  I did change the recipe, however, by substituting brown rice, which our family routinely uses.  I used precooked shrimp and sliced cooked chicken, added some sliced mushrooms, & sprinkled some cashews on top at the end as some reviewers had suggested.

I do very little Chinese.  I just personally don't care for it, but my fiance is constantly craving it.  Made this with dinner last night.  I didn't touch it, so this review is based on what my fiance had to say.  He said it was good for Americanized Chinese food, but nothing beats getting fried rice in the cardboard boxes with chopsticks.  He also suggested adding a little more soy next time.  The pan I used was apparently not big enough.  We joked afterword that my stove top looked like a tornado came through and hit a chinese garden.  Maybe with some practice, I'll get good at this. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Wow!  The first time I made this, all I had was ham, onion, garlic, celery and lima beans(!) and it was STILL good!  I've tried other fried rice recipes before and they just didn't work.  A keeper.  Thanks!

This is very good.  I appreciate the suggestions by the other reviewers (like cooling the rice beforehand).  I think going low on the soy sauce is a good idea.  I like to prepare it and add hot n' spicy sauce afterward to my prefered taste.  I think it's better than some Chinese food out there.

This is one of best fried rice I've made w/o a package helping me out w/seasoning. Although I did not like all the veggies the second time I made it I didn't add them and it came out just great. It was a great meal for me who happens not to like to much asian food.

Followed closely.  Used only chicken.  Used brown rice.  Used chicken broth with a splash of gravy master as I had no soy sauce.  Very easy.  Very good.

Made this delicious fried rice with onions, garlic, carrots, 2 jumbo cut-up shrimp, and cut up pea pods because that's what I had in the house. Decreased the soy sauce a bit and added a few splashes of fish sauce at the end. Topped with thin sliced scallion and it was fabulous, according to my husband and biggest critic!  Thanks for a great recipe!

There are others I agree with on these reviews but the major point is the rice.
You don't need day or 2 day old rice. 
Pour your rice into the pan you want to cook it in and dry roast it until is opaque.  It becomes converted like Uncle Ben's.  It will come out fluffy and you don't have to wait.  I do this for all rice recipes except sushi rice so my rice always comes out fluffy.

Firstly as most stated, the rice needed to be cooked at least a day ahead (great for leftovers) and chilled in refrigerator.   So this needs to be a two-day meal.  The white rice still stuck together and flavors were bland. 
My second attempt with this recipe, I used jasmine rice---rinsed then cooked per directions.  Scramble the eggs and set aside. In a wok saute the veggies in butter.  Set aside.  Saute the rice in sesame oil; add soy sauce.  Then add the veggies and egg.  Serve with slices green onions.

I've been making fried rice different ways fiver the years and this is a good recipe. I only added ground beef though, since it's what I had on hand. Broth and the seseme or peanut oil add great flavor.

Came out fantastic! I made mine without any meat. Tastes like fried rice from a Chinese restaurant! I did boil my rice in vegetable broth to add more flavor. I bet abpork, chicken, or miso broth would work great too!

My husband and I really enjoyed this! Not a fan of celery, so I skipped it and used sweet pepper instead. Sugar snap pea pods are coming out of the garden, so I added them. Boneless sirloin pork steak was on sale, so I substituted it for the other protein. Besides the soy sauce, I seasoned the dish with a little Chinese five spice seasoning. Delicious!

I've made it twice now and my guys liked it both times.  Both times I used leftover pork roast only.  I also had leftover rice both times, it worked out great.  The first time I added in bell pepper.  This time I added zucchini.  I look foreward to adding this into our meal rotation.  Great way to use up leftovers.

I used this recipe as a base to use up leftovers I had in the fridge.  My entire meal was made in under 20 min!  I started this recipe as written with the oil, onion and garlic.  Then I added frozen mixed stir-fry vegetables and the soy sauce.  Cooked it until veggies were tender and added in my leftover pork tenderloin that I had cut into thin strips.  Stirred until pork was heated through and then transferred to a dish and set aside.  In the same wok, I added the egg and cooked it, chopped it up and then added my leftover rice.  Mixed until heated through and then returned my pork/veggies to the wok and combined it all.  Turned out great!

I did a veggie version. So no meat, but I added 2 eggs, and substituted mung beans for the peas. Left out the bell paper, and honestly it seemed to taste better that way. This is an excellent recipe to  suit your own needs.

I made this as a side dish to use up some leftover white rice. I omitted all the meat and skipped the celery because I didn't have any on hand. I made the mistake of actually using the sesame oil to stir fry - the oil burned over medium heat and left a nasty smell in my kitchen, and the flavor wasn't there in the final product. Next time I'll use peanut oil to stir fry and add a little sesame oil later with the soy sauce. I didn't find this very flavorful, I added some dry Asian seasoning mix to spice it up and that helped.

Delicious, quick and easy. I used cold day old rice and made with just ham, yellow bell pepper and some thawed frozen peas for veggies because that's what I had. Threw in some garlic powder and onion powder. It was yummy. Will definitely make again.

This is another favourite in my home. I make it often. I change it up depending on my pantry but once you have the basics, it is fun to make.

SO bad! WAY too much soy sauce and it not only was extremely salty, but there was no flavor in this dish other than soy.

Thank you for this recipe!  We loved it!  I hate when people rate a recipe after changing it a bunch but I have to say, I cooled the rice (on a cookie sheet out in the snow for 10 min) otherwise I followed recipe & can't say enough!  Way better than greasy restaurant style! Thank you again!

I also cooked rice ahead of time so it was room temp by the time I made the fried rice.   Cooked the chicken while cooking the onions and garlic in separate skillets.  I used just chicken and half a bag of frozen peas, carrots and green beans.  Also added a jiggle or two of garlic salt.

Great recipe. I used only shrimp and no chicken or ham for the meat, and we loved this. The only change we would make is to add another egg.

As the submitter suggested, use what you have and like.  I just eliminated ham and carrots and of course had rice in fridge for 24 hours.  Missing this step lost one point but if half points were given would of done that.

Love recipes that are easy to adapt as I almost always change them to our tastes anyway.

Made it last night. It's excellent. The only thing I would say is that the "10 min." prep time is not accurate. Chopping and dicing took me an hour by hand. One could probably speed up with chopping gadgets or food processor.

Love the sesame oil--I added some frozen chopped spinach and some ground flax seed.  Great flavor on this and as she mentions, add whatever veggies you have on hand! I used some left over rice I had in the fridge and will be making this recipe again.

This was fantastic! I've made chicken fried rice many times over the years, but this was by far the best! I didn't have shrimp, ham, or green peas, but it was still great. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Left out the chicken and green pepper, added one more egg and scrambled them separately, then mixed them into the rice and vegetable mixture that I'd already combined.  Was a big hit here, we'll be having it again soon!

Classic side dish... chicken can be replaced with a ham or even an egg... building a good foundation for a excellent meal.

I made this last night for suppre and it was really good.  I used brown rice because it's healthier.  Only used the chicken because my boyfriend doesn't like seafood.  Thanks for a great recipe.

A nice basic fried rice that you can adjust in multiple ways.  Next time I would add grated fresh ginger and cut back just a tad on the soy sauce.

I love this recipe and worked to simplify making it.  I saute the onion, garlic, carrot, and celery together with a little vegetable oil, then add the soy sauce, cooked chicken and frozen green peas.  I add the shrimp just before adding the cooked white rice.  The green pepper and egg are optional, and I do not use the ham.  You can modify this recipe by adding veggies you like or deleting what you do not like. I've gotten many compliments on this recipe.

The only meat I used in this rice was chic. I used mushrooms instead of peppers. Since the sesame oil is so potent, I'll use 1/2 sesame and 1/2 EVOO next time. Thanks for a great base recipe that I can change around depending on what's in the frig.

This is a great recipe. I did modify a bit after reading other reviewers ideas.  I used brown rice, onion, garlic, fresh ginger, Liquid Aminos by Bragg (great soy sauce subst.), broccoli, and two eggs.  Served with flanken ribs aka kalbi ribs.

Everyone loved this, including my picky 13 yo.  The only thing I did differently was I added soy beans instead of peas.  I doubled the recipe to have for dinner on a busy school night.

Simple ingredients that may be in the house. I used EVOO rather than Sesame oil, it came out great.  Again, very easy.

*I use a rice cooker I bought at Walgreens for $12, it works great!

this is the dish I cook most often. Old reliable recipe. Kids love it, I use Jasmine and avoid the soy sauce, keeping it gluten free.

Outstanding!!!  I changed it up a bit with what I had on hand (no ham, no celery, no green pepper and no peas and I used rotisserie chicken breast) and it was still GREAT.   I would recommend adding some butter (3 TB or so) to the rice right before adding the soY, made it moist.  I also used leftover white rice from a chinese carryout.  This is now a favorite meal of mine!

I thought this was a great recipe. I used bell peppers all colors chopped up and broccoli with the onion and garlic.  It was really yummy, this has become a staple in our house.

I don't think I could say enough good things about this recipe.  There are so many different flavors and textures with the ham, chicken, shrimp and veggies, and yet they all work together to create a fabulous one dish meal.  This one was perfect for a healthy, quick meal that the family loved.

Followed  the review by Boonie post July 2006. I did not use the green pepper or small shrimp, ham or chicken breast. Used frozen peas and carrots, chopped onion and celery. and pork. Prepared as recommended after cooking vegetables added to cold rice.  Then chopped pork into small pieces and cooked in wok. Added to rice. Other than that I followed Bonnie's suggestions.

At first I thought it was missing something but I went back and added exrta sesame oil and a little extra soy, and it fixed what it was lacking before. My 15yr old loved it and I have to say, I love it too. Really easy to make and I think next time Im gonna add a little extra ham in there. I really liked the taste of that in there.

Delish!  Added bean sprouts, only used chicken.  Used less rice - we LOVE veggies!  Needed more soy sauce.  Made rice day ahead.  Will try to get rice crispy next time.

A really good base recipe.  I only had ham and shrimp on hand.  I never use celery in my fried rice so I left that out.  Other than that the recipe was a good one.  You can really put anything in fried rice that you like.  A great way to use leftovers in the fridge.  Yum!

This was really good and a good base recipe for fried rice. It made A LOT! I cut out the shrimp and chicken and doubled the ham, cut out the bell pepper and instead added cabbage and green onion.  I also added an extra egg.  Really yummy, everyone loved it!

This was pretty good.  I added an additional egg because I thought it needed it.  Also, 1/4C soy sauce was way too much.  Just add to taste.

This was my first attempt at fried rice and I took into consideration several recipes but mostly followed this one.  I was extremely happy with how it turned out.  I added some minced ginger with the garlic and green onions at the end.  I omitted the bell pepper, peas, and celery.  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

It was very delicious. I ommited the vegetables and ham. I used brown rice instead. It was very delicious but I did not use soy sauce because all I had on hand was one made with corn syrup. It was fine with sea salt though.  Not like my local restaurant but probably would have been if i added soy sauce.

What a great way to use the random leftovers in the fridge! I happened to have shrimp and (fake) lobster from another recipe so I threw it in with some chopped broccoli, peppers, onions, carrots, and peas and it was awesome! This is definitely a five star recipe because it is so easy and flexible:)

This was wonderful.  I used cold rice and added a few dashes of fish sauce and a sprinkling of sugar.  It was kind of a cross between this recipe and the fried rice with cilantro recipe.  Yummy!

This was soo easy and fast!  We order out alot, and almost never use the white rice that comes with the meals, so I used that instead of cooking some.  I also made it with just the onions, garlic, and peas & eggs.  It came out GREAT!  it only took a few minutes and my husband who is so pickey with everything liked it!  Thanks!

As some others have said, this is a very good base. I followed the recipe (leaving out the ham) and then used the sauce recipe from Broccoli with Garlic Butter and Cashews (leaving out the cashews). The different sauce was just what this recipe needed to give it a little pizazz. Also, using leftover rice will fry up much nicer.

Great recipe - very easy.  Like some have suggested, use day old, chilled rice if you can (I just chilled mine for 6 hours or so).  I used a combination of peanut oil and sesame oil for an added nutty flavor for the onions and garlic, added chopped up water chestnuts with the carrots and peppers (only used 1/2 pepper so as not to over power) and at the very end, stirred in some bean sprouts - a very worth while addition in my opinion.  Also, before adding those sprouts, add a tablespoon or two more sesame oil just for flavor as sesame oil works well as a flavor oil and less so for frying/saute'.  This recipe tasted better the next day and my 11 year old daughter loved it as well, a great endorsement.

I gave this four stars because I didn't have any garlic, so I used garlic powder instead.  It was good, but it needed a little something more.  I think maybe it was the garlic.  I don't know what kind of seasonings I should have put in it, but it was still very good.

This recipe has become a standby at our house.  I now save terriyaki beef or terriyaki pork tenderloin leftovers so I can prepare this dish.  I use whatever veggies I have on hand.  I will no longer have a stir fry without first preparing this dish.  It is crucial to cook the rice the night before and it helps if you work to cut up the veggies the night before as well.  Enjoy!!

Soooo good! I love the combination of meats. I used Canadian bacon instead of ham since it's what I had. I changed up the veggies a little and added an extra egg, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I'll definitely make it again, especially when I have a little bit of different kinds of meats to use up.

This is so easy to prepare.  I took the advice of others and use leftover rice which seems to work better than freshly cooked.  I use whatever vegetables I have on hand and need to use up and I'll even omit the meat altogether and it's still delicious.

my best attempt at fried rice yet!  I used freshly cooked but refrigerated brown rice.  I didn't add any of the meat as it was served as a side dish to a meat main item.  the sesame oil was a great addition and I flavored with soy sauce to taste.  will definitely make again!  thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe, but my step son gave it 4 stars.  He is half Chinese.  He is an extremely picky eater, and he is a fanatic about fried rice.  He is the reason I am in search of a great fried rice recipe.  He loves Bennihana's fried rice, so it's difficult to find anything that compares.  Even the copy cat Bennihana Fried rice I found on another website isn't "quite right" according to him.  He says this recipe "is the closest to the best".  I'm still looking for the "best".  In the meantime...this fried rice recipe is my favorite, and it's the one I'm using.

With all of the rave reviews, maybe I was expecting too much from this but I brought this to a party and most people purusing the food table walked past it.  It tasted good but nothing that would knock your socks off.  I think it actually deserves 3.5 stars but gave it only 3 (because you can't give half a star) but also because it obviously didn't appeal to 95% of the party guests.

I combined this recipe with two others 
from this site. I had a failure with 
the Taiwanese-Style Three Cup Chicken
and didn't want to waste those ingredients. I salvaged what I could of
the sauce, pieced out the chicken and 
used it in this recipe.

I used orange bell pepper instead of
green, just a personal choice. I also
used the idea from a Fried Rice recipe
from this site with cooking three eggs
in oil in a seperate pan, omelette style,
then cutting it up and putting it in 
the rice. That works better for me. I
also used about a cup of pre-cut matchstick carrots to cut back on time
spent chopping.

For those who are making this at home,
think about combining the sauce from
the Taiwanese-Style Three Cup Chicken
in this recipe, with just a little more 
soy sauce thrown in for good measure.
You won't be disappointed. I omitted the
shrimp and ham, as I had enough chicken
and I didn't want to overload the flavor palate.

My husband loved this. I'll be making this again.

This was so good! I made this as a side dish with sesame chicken so the only meat I added was some deli ham. The only other change I made was to add an extra egg. Totally satisfied my (pregnancy) Chinese food craving and my 18 month old loved this! This will be going into my regular recipe rotation. Thanks!

This recipe was great! I just used shrimp, onions, carrots, peas and zucchini. Also, I made the rice in the morning and left it in the fridge all day. Wonderful!  Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

Quite good, not as good as a restaurant, but also not as greasy. It went together faster than I expected. I used brown rice and chicken meat only based on personal preference. I feel like it was a pretty healthy meal this way. I look forward to eating the leftovers and to making it again with cold rice and a variety of spices and vegetables.

This was fantastic! I've made it three times in two weeks and will make it again tomorrow. The rice HAS to be leftover so it's almost crunchy the next day. That way it doesn't get so mushy when combined with the veggies and meat.

Yummy but something was missing...just can't put my finger on it. As usual, I made personal preference modifications...omitted all meat w/ the exception of shrimp. I added soybeans, suger snap peas, matchstick carrots, snow peas and fresh mushrooms.  This is something I'll continue working with but can't decide what was missing...maybe the MSG!

I enjoyed this so much that I felt the urge to write my first review! I followed some of the other reviewers' suggestions and used rice that I had made the previous day. I also added in a little cayenne pepper and ginger. For vegetables I used peas, sprouts and some broccoli slaw which included broccoli, carrots and red cabbage. For the meats I used diced ham, shrimp and chicken just as the recipe stated. I also used 3 eggs instead of 1. It was delicious and tastes even better on day 2!

Good and a nice way to use up the left overs.  I made this exactly as directed.  Next time however, I would add more garlic and some hot pepper flakes, to up the flavor just a little more. The best part is that you could use any left over's that you have on hand.  Even better the second day.

This is the BEST fried rice recipe!  I've been using it for a couple of years now, and I never make it to use up leftovers.  I make the rice fresh and its purpose is a side dish with stir-fried veggies.  My notes:  I don't care for sesame oil, so I use canola.  I use rice right out of the rice cooker.  I don't add meats/seafood because I usually serve this alongside chicken...either chicken & cashews in my stir-fried veggies or sweet & sour chicken.  It is a great way to complete a tasty oriental meal!

Loved this. I didn't have "left-over" cooked white rice, so I made some earlier in the day and popped it into the fridge until it was time to make dinner. This was a first for me. I can't believe I made something so that I could use it as a left-over. But it seems from many reviewers that this is a must. I used green onions instead of a regular one, sliced deli ham (cut into strips) for the meat, omitted the carrots, icreased the green peas, added two eggs instead of one, and decreased the soy sauce in half. if people like more soy sauce they can always add it to their own helping. thank you so much for this recipe. I'm sure any combination of meat, seafood, and vegies would be great in this.

Very solid recipe.  As a pregnant woman, with all sorts of new cravings each week (e.g., fried rice today), this was a snap to make.  As ginger helps alleviate morning sickness AND also adds a nice kick, I included about a 1/2 teaspoon of minced ginger.  Next time, I may add more.  Also - to increase the protein, given that this may be the only thing I can stomach all day, I added an extra egg.  Terrific!

This rice was great!  I doubled the recipe and left out the shrimp and the chicken because I had none on hand, plus my girls will not eat shrimp.  For the ham, I used a ham steak.  Gave the rice a nice flavor.  I also used reduced sodium soy sauce, and added a bit of salt to the veggies to sweat them and get the maximum flavor out of them.  I also added 2 tbsp hoisin sauce for an extra kick.

I was disappointed in the recipe. Maybe my expectation was too high after reading the other reviews. To me, a bag of Giant Eagle Shrimp Fried Rice for $6 was just as good, without the time to cut everything up myself.

Going by all the wonderful reviews of this, I thought it would be delicious. I made it for dinner tonight and was so let down. In anticipation I thought I'd have to stop myself from overindulging, but in reality, I didn't even really want to finish my serving. It wasn't horrible, but I don't get all the 5 star ratings. Sorry. :-(

This is a great recipe. I have made it several times now and it always turns out like I remember having it in Japan.  I do use an extra egg, but other than that, follow the recipe pretty much as written. My wife is not a big rice fan and she even likes it.  I even like it cold!

Easy and delicious.  My kids and husband enjoyed this, I didn't have any meat so I just used shrimp and added some powdered ginger to spice it up a little.

Delicious! I wanted a vegetable version so I didn't use the meats, but I did add cucumbers to mine.  I also added my secret ingredient...PINEAPPLE.  It adds the perfect amount of sweetness to counteract the saltiness of the soy sauce.  Just ate it for lunch today (2 days after I made it) and it's even better.

This is yummy!  The sesame oil makes the entire recipe.  

I did a couple of variations - I used jasmine rice, which added some additional flavor.  I didn't add any meat, instead I did two eggs and some additional veggies (mushrooms, baby corn, etc.)

Next time I will rinse the rice first because it was a little too clumpy when I added it to the vegetables.  Aside from that, this recipe gets an A+!

I thought this was an excellent fried rice recipe. Since I only eat chicken I omitted the ham and shrimp and it was still tasty. I used only 2Tablespoons of sesame oil in addition to the peas I added extra veggies:fresh green beans and red and green peppers. I also sprinkled peanuts on top for a little extra protein. Yum!

I've made several attempts to make fried rice on my own and it never seems to live up to the expectation of our favorite Japanese restaurant.  (In fact, nothing does!)  The rice was good, just not the best.

I did not add any meats, because I served this as a side-dish, but I did cook the rice in chicken broth for added flavour. That said, this was very bland, and I will not make it again.

I've never made fried rice before so this was a new adventure.  It was really really good!  I cooked and cooled the rice in the fridge.  I then fried up the onions (white and green) and garlic together until brown with 2T of sesame oil, 1T olive oil.  Added carrots, chicken and ham.  Fried it up until it popped alot.  Added soy sauce.  Stirred it into the cooled rice.  Added two eggs to the pan and cooked.  Added that to the  rice.  Waited until we were ready to eat and then put the whole thing back in the pan to heat up.  We were also having mandarin oranges so I added a little of the juice to it.  I served it with General Tso chicken from the hot deli at the store.  My husband and I loved it, kids not so much.  More for us!

This was pretty good.  Made it for supper last night.  I did not add any ham because I really dont care for it in a stir fry recipe, everything else I kept the same.  Very good and will make again!

This dish was really good but not great. I substituted hot chili oil for one tablespoon of the sesame oil, and used all shrimp. Don't use all the soy sauce unless you like things really salty, just flavor to your own tastes! Rice was mushy, even after making the day before. I think I'm going to make it again using a slightly undercooked basmati rice and see how that goes.

Good recice, but the soy sauce is too much. Do it bit by bit to taste.

This is a great recipe.  My teenage son and his friend loved it, me too. I used brown rice for a higher fiber content than white rice.  I used brocolli instead of bell pepper & green peas, since that was what I had at home. I didn't use chicken breast since there was plenty of protein between the shrimp and ham.  This is an easy recipe and I will definitly make this again.

I love this recipe, it's so easy and quick but super delicious.  I made it with just 1 tablespoon and sesame oil and it was still delicious.  My bf constantly asks me to make this fried rice for him!

This was wonderful recipe! I used leftover rice from that weeks curry meal, and it really cut down on the prep time. The taste was wonderful even without the meat added. I can't wait to make this again!

Good recipe.  I followed the recipe except I added the veggies before the meat because I wanted them to cook longer. I didn't have ham and actually wished I had included it.  I would definitely double the soy sauce next time (I used more chix and shrimp so it needed more-we ended up adding it on our plate). I also added some shakes of fish sauce at the end. This has a simple, healthy flavor and worth the work. I served with a lettuce/carrot salad with bottle ginger dressing.

This recipe is quick and easy.  Make the rice ahead of time, and use any cooked meat you have on hand. I added some stir fry sauce while cooking the vegetables, and used snow peas instead of regular peas.  Additionally, adding some fresh (or powdered) ginger and a little crushed red pepper makes it very delicious. The nice thing about this recipe is almost anything goes and it is great!  A great way to get rid of aging vegetables in your fridge.

Delicious and easy. I was feeding a non-shrimp eater, so increased the chicken and ommitted shrimp; still had a fresh-tasting, nutritious one-dish meal. Great with a crisp green salad and bread.

My boyfriend really liked this, and I think this recipe would be great, but I added a can of bean sprouts (since I couldn't find fresh ones). DO NOT DO THIS! It made the whole thing taste like generic canned chow mein! YUCK! I will try this recipe again, but next time I will follow it exactly!

This recipe is great.  However, I didn't add any of the meat.  I love letting the rice "fry" a little to get some crispiness.  Very good.  Thank you.

I really like this recipe it always goes over very well. I usually prepare the rice ahead of time in my rice cooker. And I usually prepare the recipe without the meat, but this one is definitely a keeper.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, only omitting the ham as I didn't have any. It turned out okay, good use of leftover rotissiere chicken, but I wouldn't make it for company. But I will make it again, maybe just tinker with it a little for personal taste.

Very good recipe!  Great way to get kids to eat their vegetables.  My boys didn't even know they were eating carrots.  I did not use shrimp because we don't have any.  I am looking forward to using shrimp next time.

I omitted the chicken and ham just because it doesn't sound appealing to me.  This was easy and good to eat.  I will add pork to this next time.

This gets a five for being pretty quick and easy, very good, and my whole family loves it! And you can do so many different things with it. For a very quick though not quite authentic variation, I microwave frozen vegetables (whatever kind I have on hand) while I'm preparing the rest. My kids also like it with more eggs, we use about 5! I scramble these and set them aside in a bowl while I cook the meal in the same non-stick pan or wok. I then just combine everything in the order of the recipe. My kids like best with only diced ham ( I get a 1/2 inch slice of Virginia ham from the deli and chop). I also sprinkle a little ginger with the soy sauce at the end. Very good!

I added extra eggs and soy sauce. Used shrimp and leftover pork, also sliced mushrooms. Tried with leftover long grain and wild rice mix, but it was too seasoned. Will make often with regular rice.

This was great fried rice! Not as simple as some other fried rice recipes I have tried, but tasty none-the-less.

We thought this bordered on restaurant quality (and I know this was healthier).  I used chili oil, doubled the egg, and left out the peas and green pepper because I didn't have them on hand.  I'll add peas next time.

Excellent.  Easy to make.  Made a huge panfull that sat on the stove late afternoon for those that wanted to munch whenever.  Hubby loved.  Great for leftover Easter ham.

This was a pretty good dish. I added the egg AFTER I mixed the rice in.  Also, after I added the soy, I let the rice fry for about 5 minutes.  Gave it that "authenticity" I was looking for. I found that long grain rice works fine, but short to medium grain is more restaurant-style.  I will make this again.  Thanks!!

This just didn't turn out how I hoped. Way too mushy. It has great ingredients but maybe I should have read the other reviews before I made this. Sorry.

Very good. Only changes I made were that I omitted the chicken (didn't have any leftover) and added fresh grated ginger. A simple dish, good for a leftover-stuffed refrigerator!

Well actually a four and a half.  I made a couple small changes to the recipe; omitted the sesame oil, added ginger, and used 3 eggs instead of one.  My husband and I both thought that it was great.  Very quick, cheap, and easy.  We will be adding it to our regulars.  The only reason I do not give it a five is because while it was very good, it did not wow me.

It was good, but I almost gave it a three because there's nothing outstanding about it, in my opinion.  It's just plain old fried rice with meat and veggies, nothing new.

Very good and very easy to make, so much flavor!  I made a few adjustments according to what I had on hand, I used minute rice (added a package of chicken oxo to the water), didn't used any of the meat, no gr.pepper and no peas, used an additional egg.  I refridgerated the rice after cooking, allowing it to cool, to avoid sticking and then threw it in to the skillet until it was warmed through.  Thank you Lynda for a great recipe!

Great recipe! My family loved it! I used peanut oil to fry the rice, as I was using it with the rest of the Chinese Food I was cooking. It complimented the Egg Foo Yung and Stir-Fry I cooked (both from these site as well!) I also added bean sprouts to the recipe. Very enjoyable recipe. Thanks Lynda!

Delicious! I have tried several different recipes for fried rice, but none of them tasted like it came from restaurant!  This one did!  I served it as a side dish to General Tsao Shrimp, so I omitted the shrimp.  I also omitted the meats (I do not eat meat) and the carrots-just to save time.   The recipe is QUICK and DELICIOUS!

I used cold leftover brown rice that I "fried" in a cast iron skillet before adding the other ingredients.  I added bean sprouts to the vegetable/ham mixture for the last 5 minutes of cooking, and an extra egg.  This was really great fried rice!  And with brown rice...sooo good for you.  The only downside is that it was a little time-taking because of chopping all the vegetables.  But definitely worth it!

This was excellent!  I used whatever I had left over, in this case it was chicken, carrots, peas, onions and I threw in some fresh spinach.  My husband loved it!  This recipe will be used whenever I have leftovers.  Really quick and easy to make.

This is a GREAT way to use leftovers!!  I had leftover yellow rice to use up, chicken, & pork roast (instead of using ham).  Sesame oil is a must to really get the true flavor.  I used half of the amount of soy sauce and 2 eggs, but that is just a matter of personal taste.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!!

I liked this rice....but not the best.....nothing compares to take-out fried rice. I added fresh bean sprouts, pea pods, 2 eggs and eliminated the green pepper and celery. I only used shrimp and didn't add the chicken and ham. Made this with "Filipino Lumpia, oriental Dipping Sauce and Chicken Satay" on this site.

I keep meaning to rate this recipe - it is wonderful! I usually make this without the meat and we just love it. Sometimes I adjust the portions of the veggies and add or take different ones away. This is a very forgiving recipe that is good. I think that this is best when you cook the rice the day before. I served this tonight with Sesame Beef, what a wonderful meal. Thanks for sharing and Enjoy!

This was a very easy and good way to use leftovers. We had some leftover pork, so I made pork fried rice and it came out awesome. I added an extra egg, but other than that stuck with the recipe. Even my 4 year old ate this. Thanks!

This was really good.  I didn't put in any of the meat only because I made Teryaki pork to go with this.  And I didn't use the celery and bell pepper because my son doesn't like them.  I just wanted a basic fried rice recipe and this one worked well.  Had great flavor.  Family loved it. **UPDATE** Just made this again but this time I put in the shrimp and chicken.  I still left out the celery & green pepper though, don't like that in fried rice.  This is a great recipe!

Very good. I changed it a bit due to what I had on hand. I used olive oil since I didn't have sesame, however I did add sesame seeds and hot pepper flakes. Used roasted garlic, wild rice (cooked in veggie broth, shrimp, mushrooms, celery, onion, and a few stir fry veggies. Topped it with more sesame seed and a few rice noodles. Very good, and very pretty

This turned out excellent for me.  This is the first fried rice I'd tried, and my husband and I both loved it.  Altered one or two things for what I had in the house, but overall great.  Thanks.
