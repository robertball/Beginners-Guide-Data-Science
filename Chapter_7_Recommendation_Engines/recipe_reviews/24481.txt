Yummy-I used hot cocoa packets that take water instead of milk and then put in the shots of schnapps.  What a delicious drink.

I loved it and so did my husband, it's a bit on the sweet side though and really rich if you use milk so go with the water. It doesn't taste like alchohol at all, it's really nice.

This hot drink is one of my favorites!  VERY easy to make and VERY good for sipping on cold nights.  It's rated an overall 4 because the alcohol in the drink is not kid friendly.  Otherwise, it would've rated a 5!

Perfect combination! I love chocolate and caramel together. I make my hot chocolate using 1 tbsp cocoa, 2 tbsp Splenda or sugar, and a mug of skim lactose-free milk. The schnapps make it so sweet and satisfying... great idea.

This makes the BEST hot chocolate! The schnapps adds just a hint of flavor but I couldn't taste the alcohol at all (which I really liked) but if you like it stronger, add an extra ounce of schnapps. I used skim milk and it was very creamy. For the best presentation, definitely put some whipped cream on top.

Made a quart of this (with hot water, not milk) and took it to our neighbors' the other night.  A big hit!  Very satisfying.

This is delicious....especially on a cold day. I did reduce the cocoa by half to cut the sweet for my personal taste. Thanks for sharing SHADYEYEZ BTW My photo did NOT do this justice:(

Was a great dessert for a cold autumn night! I garnished w/ a dollop of marshmallow creme & sprinkled that w/ some heath bar chips...served it in vintage china coffee cups instead of mugs. Hubby wasn't too thrilled about having the idea of hot chocolate for dessert but agreed that this was very satisfying...& it made us sleep like babies. Thanks Steph!

This drink is awesome and so easy to make.  I was looking for a hot chocolate recipe that used milk instead of water.  This is perfect for entertaining guests on the cold evenings and even handing a cup to my husband after he's been out working in the yard on chilly evenings.
Absolutely yummy!  Thanks Steph.

The other reviewers were right. Use water in place of milk. Using your own homemade cocoa mix? Even better.

Want to take it up a notch? Use buttershots AND irish cream. You'll wish for snow after trying one of these just
so you can have another!

Simple and delicious!  No whipped cream necessary.  I think it takes away from the flavor.

Very good on a cold winter's day. I make a similar drink with coco or milo, hot milk, ice cream or cream and irish cream liquer. Good if you don't want the caffeine before bed.
