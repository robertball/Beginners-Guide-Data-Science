I got this recipe from the Guinness website several years ago, and I've made it many, many times since then.  It is our traditional Christmas dinner with Colcannon.  Because I always use sweet onions, I do not use the raisins.  It takes a while to prepare, but it's definitely worth it for a special occasion.

Recipe Group Selection:  09, March 2013 ~ I made this for my guys, knowing I would not be trying it.  I used 1 pound of round steak and 1 pound of venison.  I also had to sub green peppers for the mushrooms as they don’t care for them and omitted the raisins for the same reason.  I have never used lard before; therefore I didn’t have any so I used olive oil instead.  So, I made the Steak and Irish Stout Pie using the above ingredients, plus the rest listed and the guys LOVED it!  They took one bite and said, “Give this one 5-stars”.  Because of the length of time it takes to prepare this recipe, I did all the browning and baking of the meats on one night, cooled and refrigerated the dish over night.  The next night, I heated the filling and proceeded with the recipe.  sassyoldlady, another AR member sent out a reminder about piercing the bottom crust when pre-baking it.  That was so helpful, as I would not have done that because the instructions didn’t tell me to do so.  I pre-baked the crust, add the filling, minus some of the broth and added the top crust.  Mine did take about 20-25 minutes to completely bake.  I let the pie rest 10-15 minutes before cutting to let it set up.  As I said before, my guys loved it.  When they reheated the leftovers, they added a dollop of sour cream and enjoyed it even better that way.  Thanks Michael St. Laurent for sharing your recipe – it is a keeper for my family!

Made this for Recipe Group...I liked it, but the guys LOVED it! I did do a few things differently though...I didn't have any lard, so I used about 3 Tbsps. butter, 2 onions instead of 5, which seemed like A LOT to me, and no raisins. IMO, this did need some salt and pepper. It's not that this recipe was complicated, b/c it was not, but I just felt like it took me all day to make it, lol...maybe I was just in one of those moods today, lol. Oh, also, it took longer than 15 mins. to finish in the oven, once I put the top crust on (took more like 30 mins.), but that was fine b/c I had the extra time. The flavors are great, and this cut beautifully. I would most likely make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

First time I followed recipe exactly; second time I made the following changes:  Eliminated lard; Reduced bacon to 5 slices, reduced onions to 4, added 2 sliced carrots & 1/2 cup chopped leafy celery hearts, replaced white mushrooms with portobellas, added 3 cloves garlic, 2 tsp low sodium beef bullion, 1/2 tsp chili powder and 3 tsp dried thyme. After browning I cooked filling ingredients in slow cooker instead of oven - low for 4-5 hours. I added cornstarch slurry in last hour to aid thickening.  I used just a top pastry crust when baking. By my calculation, eliminating the lard, reducing bacon and using one crust reduces the calories/serving to around 400 & cut fat by more than half, and the fatty ingredients weren't missed. That's a win! Next time I'll try a puff pastry top crust.

Have you ever spent so much time making something that by the time it was ready to eat you were sick of it?  I think that's what happened to me here.  Made it exactly as written.  I found it to be very greasy. I just didn't care for the flavor at all.  Definitely needs some sort of seasoning to balance out the sweetness of the Guiness, sugar and pastry.  My family seemed to like it though.  I think after spending half of the day preparing and cooking this I just wasn't interested anymore.

This was incredible!!  I made this for St. Patrick's Day and my husband said this is a keeper!!  I followed everything exactly except I didn't have raisins and I only used 1/2 of a very large onion.  The flavor was so good and at the end end of the oven cooking I threw a handful of baby carrots into the pot.  I am going to make this again as a regular stew with potatoes too.  Thanks for sharing!!

This had good flavor but I don't like needing a side dish for something like this so if I made it again I would add some veggies and more gravy. I made a quarter of this since I had 1/2 pound of very rare steak in the freezer I was looking to use up. I used bacon grease instead of lard and then didn't think the mushrooms were even worth the trouble for such a meager amount so I doubled them(there still weren't too many for me). I didn't know what size/type of onion was intended so I used 3/4 of a large vidalia and that was about right for us. I did not use the raisins. There was a lot of stuck-on "browned bits and flour" in the skillet when done so I sort of deglazed it with the beer to get all the flour in the broth. I used 4 oz instead of 3 oz for the 1/4 recipe and the broth was nice and thick. I made individual pot pies and the bottom crust shrunk a little but was nice and substantial. The whole thing popped right out of the pan. I served it with Scottish Bubbles and Squeak Patties which I left in the mashed form rather than make patties. All this for recipe group 3/16/13 :)

This was excellent!  I followed the directions exactly except I made the filling one day and assembled and cooked the pie the next day. And, I personally enjoyed the very few raisins one tablespoon added. I used my own "Nun's Pastry" recipe which always turns out perfectly.

Made for Recipe Group. I just dusted the cubes with flour until they were all coated. I also salt, pepper, and garlic powder sprinkled the meat first. Not ever having lard here, I put some olive oil in the skillet(by mistake), added about 6 tbsp of bacon grease to go with, and browned the meat. I chopped some already cooked bacon, added that to it. Sauteed one huge vidalia onion that I sliced instead of minced(more would have been good)and added that to the steak. No raisins (hubby would not have eaten this with them in there), and I forgot to pick up some stout, so Bud Lite went in there instead. I didn't remember to put some holes in the crust before blind baking and it split, cracked, and puffed. Added the steak mix in anyway, which I thought was still way too runny. I thickened it with a little flour slurry first. Put on the top crust, vented to release steam, and baked till brown. Upon cutting to serve the bottom crust had pretty much disappeared into the meat mixture. Beer gives this an excellent flavor, much to my surprise. It does need a little something in there, maybe a dash of hot sauce and some Worcestershire for next time. And just a top crust. Loved the flakiness of the pie crust with the rich satisfying flavor of the meat part. All in all, I'd say it is something I would like to make again. Thanks for the recipe! (I did saute some mushrooms for hubby to add to his part :)

My family just thought that this recipe was great and have already requested that I make it again.  I used a blade roast (cut up into cubes) instead of the steak.   One of members had suggested that I do not use the raisins as they would not in the UK/Irleand.  I used the pie crust in the pan it came in so as a result I had some that would not fit and it was great on the mashed potatoes I had made.  This recipe reminded me of the dishes I had at an Irish/English Pubs that I went with my Dad once a month in Oshawa.

This is a holiday favorite as well, I have changed it the last couple of years though , to that in which I use one layer of pie crust on the bottom, but for the top I use a mashed potato and gently fold in whipped egg whites and freshly grated Parmesan cheese once that's mixed ,then spread gently over the meat mixture careful to not mix in.

This recipe was seriously amazing. My husband was in heaven, and the kids liked it too. I think the raisins were a great contrasting taste to the heavy meats. One thing we did do was make the filling ahead of time, since we both work, and then put it into pie crusts and baked it the next evening. You have to bake it longer that way, but it was just as good as the time we made it all at once on a weekend. I didn't pre-bake the pie crust either. I've never really seen the point. Just put tin-foil around the crust edges until the last 10-15 min of baking the pie so they won't overbrown. As always, homemade pie crusts are the best.

I also got this recipe from the Guinness website. I've had it for several years, and have made it more than once, in fact, the last time was just last week. It' s my go-to meat pie recipe.

I use a thick, flat, boneless chuck roast, cut into pieces instead of round steak. I can not get proper, thick round steak-it's all very thinly sliced. I generally cant't get flank steak or brisket either, so a small roast or thick steak is usually my best option, depending upon the budget. 

I like it with the raisins and brown sugar and often adjust the seasoning after cooking. I usually make it in the oven, but used the crock pot last week as it was too hot to turn the oven on. It does turn out well in the crock pot, but I did notice the raisins stayed intact when they usually dissolve, but they were rather dry and hard. Next time I'll plump them and run them through the processor. I don't have a problem with them, but other family members DO, and if they can't see them. . . 

I don't believe I've ever put mushrooms in it, but I'm going to try it. I do like to do the bacon first, then remove it and then do the beef. I think the bacon turns out better that way and it renders more fat out. You can always make this the day before, separate the solids from the gravy, and then defat it, and then warm it and put the crust on and bake it. It does improve the next day. 

My only two negatives are the original recipe calls for puff pastry, which I despise, so I always use a pie dough crust, and

11.14.18  I pretty much used all of the ingredients in the recipe, but I did change some of the amounts.  I never use lard, so I sub’d Crisco® shortening.  Five minced onions seemed like a lot; I used a 16 oz bag of thawed Trader Joe’s pearl onions, cutting them in half horizontally. I also added some chopped carrot, salt, pepper, and a little fresh thyme. But I did make one very significant change.  Winn-Dixie had a weekend sale on T-bone steak for $3.99/lb (cheaper than round steak, stew beef, chuck roast, etc), so I cut the meat from the bone and used it in this recipe. I checked at 1-1/2 hr, and the beef was fork tender (probably that decadent T-bone), thickened perfectly, and the flavor was simply divine!  At that point, I knew that adding the pie crust would just be like “icing on the cake.”  I baked these in 5” pie pans for individual servings, and ended up with five, three of which went into the freezer.  Next time, I’m going to try freezing the small pies without cooking. I remember eating frozen pot pies as a kid, but they sure didn’t taste like this. I also will not use any type of cut-out or lattice crust on the top, as I think the beef mixture dried out a little as a result of that.   I used a pkg of pie crusts, but do yourself a favor, and make a really good, homemade crust, this pie deserves it.  Great recipe, and it’s really quite easy to make; just takes extra time in the oven.

I normally make corned beef and cabbage for St Pattys day. This year I wanted to try something different.  This meat pie was a good choice. 

The changes I made was I seasoned the meat with salt and pepper before I added the  flour. I didn't add raisins because my husband doesn't like them.  Used canola instead of lard. I'm sure it would taste better with lard but I didn't have any.

This isn't a dish for a mid week meal for us because it takes awhile to prepare. I enjoy cooking and if it takes awhile to prepare I don't mind. It gives more time to put love into the dish.

I will be making this again and have been asked to make it again soon.

I loved it, my friends loved it! I hav venison chuck on hand so I used that as the protein. I used baby portobellos for the mushroom options, and did not add raisins. As another slight change I did not use brown sugar, but used maple bacon. I put it in my homemade pie crust and it was ridiculous.

The smell while this was in the oven about drove us crazy  it was so yummy! This dish turned out fabulous. I did have to thicken the juice a bit when I took the dish out of the oven before putting into the pie crust. No biggy.  Great recipe!

Best.  Recipe.  Ever.  We loved it!  The first time, I made it according to the directions with a few small modifications out of necessity.  I used 6 strips of bacon instead of 8 because that was what I had left in my freezer.  I freeze leftover bacon grease when I make bacon, so I used that instead of lard.  I had one of those tiny snack box of raisins and I just dumped all those in instead of having half a tablespoon left over.  When I baked the filling, I only baked it for an hour and a half instead of two and a half because the gravy was boiling off.  Instead of baking it in a foil covered casserole dish, I used my enormous cast iron fryer with the lid that can go from stove top to oven.  and it worked out great!  Next time I make this, I'm going to try adding some potatoes, carrots and onions to add some vegetable goodness.  I completely recommend this recipe for a nice Sunday dinner!

This recipe far exceeded my expectations and my husband Abby son loved it. Followed the recipe to a tee except I used stew meat that I cut into smaller chunks. Will definitely make again.

I followed the direction perfectly and became weary when it said to cook in oven for 2 1/2 hours. Then cover it with top pastry and cook until browned on top. If I wanted beef mush I could’ve done it with a blender. It lacked salt, could’ve used peas, potatoes or turnips, needed some spices like garlic or possibly Worcestershire sauce at least. Wish I could have my 3 hours back baking this drab meat mush pie. I gave it 2 stars because the directions were easy to follow. Guess I’ll have to go to Ireland to get a decent steak and stout pie.

Excellent recipe...I used my leftover london broil.  I cook it in the over for a little less as it was already cooked...the meat was so tender and I made the homemade pie crust.  My husband said it is a must to make again.  two meals out of one london broil was top notch!!  I don't like raisins so I omitted them!

Holy cow - this. is. delicious. I used leftover steak that we'd grilled two nights ago, so only baked for 1.5 hours, just enough to get things nice and tender and the flavors all married. I also added carrots and potatoes because I need to sneak veggies in where I can. The entire house smells like heaven. I served the pie with mushy peas for an incredibly perfect fall meal. (Now, if someone could tell Mother Nature that it's autumn, that'd be great.) This recipe is definitely going to be a fall/winter regular in my house. Amazing. Thank you so much for sharing.

Definitely needs salt and spices.  I added thyme, sage and marjoram for a real Brit flavor.  I also thickened the sauce a little.  I basted the pie shell with an egg/water mix to make it brown nicely and look more attractive.  I look forward to when it’s cold; a slice with Waldorf Salad is how my family ate a cold meat pie for Saturday lunch in Scotland.

I made this twice in a week with a few minor alterations and it was a huge success. 1: it needs more flavor, so I added salt and pepper, approx 2 tsp beef bullion and fresh minced garlic (3 cloves).... everything’s better with fresh garlic. 2: I dusted the bottom pie crust with egg white and baked it in the oven for 8-10 minutes prior to spooning in the filling (and I didn’t use all the liquid so it wouldn’t be too soupy and ruin my beautiful flaky pie crust), then I dusted the top pie crust lightly with egg whites before sticking in oven. It was bursting with flavor and the pie crust was beautiful, crispy and flaky, both on the bottom and top, the inside was the perfect consistency, moist but not runny and cut beautifully. There wasn’t a bit to spare and my children were singing for seconds!

Great pie! I just put in 3 smallish onions, about a cup and a half of celery, a pound of mixed frozen veggies- just carrots, peas, beans and corn. Went with the lard for this time at least.  I just used 1.3 lbs of beef, figured the veggies would take up space. I shook the beef in flour, salt & pepper mixture.  Fried celery and onions together. Mixed everything plus a can of potatoes in a bowl and put it in the oven for 2 1/2 -3 hours. While this was cooking I made a savory pie crust-because, why not? It was absolutely delicious,  especially on a cold wintry day!

I made it twice.  Once exactly as stated.  I hated the way the sugar and raisins flavored the pie.  Second time no sugar or raisins and it went up to 4 stars.

I followed the recipe pretty closely, but did not have lard. I did thicken the stew a bit with milk and cornstarch. We thought it was good, but a bit too rich. I will make again, but only use 1/2 the onions and 1/2 the stout. I might also make the stew part, freeze it and then put it together as a 2 or 3 smaller pies (there are only two of us) on another day. I  only gave it 4 stars because I was tired of smelling it cooking all day, then was not so hungry to eat it.

I have made this for my family and keep getting asked to make it again and again! I don't know that I have always used round steak, I go with what looks best and so have used other cuts of beef and it works. It is quite delicious!

Very straightforward.   Excellent instructions and really solid result.  I changed one thing in that I used an Imperial Stout rather than Guinness - higher alcohol content and more residual sugars left the dish with a slightly sweet back note.   It was delicious, and the guests devoured it.  

Next time I’ll make my own pie crust...didn’t have time this time.

Instead of baking, I cooked it in the crockpot overnight on low.  Then I kept it on warm all day until putting it into the pie crust.

I made this for St. Pat's Day 2017.  I cooked the beef in a crock pot for use of less electicity.  It had to cook for a little over 3 hours, but that wasn't a problem.  I also had to thicken it with arrow root since 1 Tbsp. wasn't enough for a whole beer.  I only used 1 large onion, 5 seemed to be too many.  I also used 2 Tbsp. brown raisins.  I will say it was delicious.  My boyfriend (who's 100% Irish) LOVED it.  Will do again.

My family loved this and cleaned the casserole dish. I had some beef short ribs left over, so using the already cooked meat made this a super quick meal. I diced a few red potatoes and cooked with sliced carrots. Made the sauce and added a tablespoon of Better than Bullion Beef seasoning. Used canned mushrooms and put everything together and covered with the pie crust. Even taking these shortcuts it was a winner.

I do not cook often but have some skill when it comes to the kitchen. I was hosting a Pi(e) party for some friends on March 14 and needed a quick and easy dinner pie I could whip up for it. I had this one cooked to completion in just 4 hours (3 hours of which it spends in the oven) and it was the hit of the night. "Out of this world" "divine" and "to die for" were some of the compliments this one yielded. Will definitely be doing this one again. Quick and easy prep (more time spent prepping than cooking) and then let the oven do the rest!

The pie was fantastic! During the process, I loved how clear the steps were, so I did not find myself freaking out halfway through (Haha!)  Next time I'm just going to season it a bit more and add more veggies, but definitely will be making this again!

While the flavor was good, it took waaaay too long. Too time consuming.  Too many steps.  I will never make this again.
