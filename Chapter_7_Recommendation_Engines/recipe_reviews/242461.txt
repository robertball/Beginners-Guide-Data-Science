DELICIOUS healthy breakfast on-the-go, I am really shocked that so few people have tried this!

I used olive oil, splenda and raisins but otherwise made the recipe as noted, putting the batter into a non-stick sprayed glass dish.

It made dense, oatmeal cookie flavoured bars with a chewy texture, and they are pretty much perfect as is. High protein, high fibre and satisfying.

I may try using only 1/4 cup oil and some applesauce or a banana just to cut the fat a little more, but I will definitely make these again!

THANKS SO MUCH FOR POSTING!

Very filling & tasty. Reduced sugar to 1/4 cup, subbed chopped dates for cranberries & applesauce for oil. Baked in oval dish for 35 min at 375.  Kids loved it - will make again.

We skipped the dry milk powder and cranberries (only because we didn't have these on hand) and added fresh, pureed peaches and toasted pecans.  We also substituted 1/2 cup maple syrup  for  brown sugar.  Our guests enjoyed it, and our discerning (read: picky) children  requested that we add it to our weekly breakfast rotation.   We eat a lot of oatmeal, and we appreciate the added protein and versatility of this recipe.

Have made it twice and used applesauce instead of oil, and Splenda brown sugar,  Added flax seed and probably will vary the recipe depending on what seeds I have around ( chia, etc).  Otherwise went by the recipe as written. It will be a staple at my house for a long time.

I'm lactose intolerant so I subbed the dry milk for pea protein powder and the milk for baby food bananas and blueberries.  It was delicious!  Better than most desserts, especially with a little whipped topping!

This is a great recipe! I've made it a few times now. I used mini chocolate chips instead of fruit. It reheats perfectly on busy mornings!

Update-10-16-16, this is in our regular breakfast rotation. I use silicone baking cups. My son and I both enjoy this one!

Very nice, healthy & simple breakfast choice. I will definitely make it again, but I will be sure to spray the pan with nonstick.....it was hard to get the "oatmeal" out of the parchment lined pan. Thanks for sharing!

OK what did I do wrong? I am a very experienced baker and this was so skimpy going into the pan I thought I had misread the pan size. I've got pictures that show how thin as to be almost nonexistent, the oatmeal was once I placed it in the pan. I don't know how to add them though. I was very disappointed as it sounded quite good.

My husband and I really liked these for fast breakfast to go.  I used applesauce in place of the oil and reduced the brown sugar by 1/4 cup.  They are healthy and kept me full until lunch.  Will definitely make again.
