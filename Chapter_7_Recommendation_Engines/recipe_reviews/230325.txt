Made this as my first pie, and it came out great.   The filling is simple, but delicious.   Don't forget the lemon peel.

I had more raspberries than blueberries so I swapped amounts.  Should have added tapioca to thicken it up.  Cheated with a premade pie crust and added a bit more flour based on reviews.  Great flavor, just a bit wet...

This is a wonderful pie recipe!  I love fruit pies, but hate pie that's pasty and or too sweet. This recipe brings out the natural flavor sand sweetness of the fruit, and was neither too runny nor too thick and pasty.  I will admit though, that I used commercial pie crusts and didn't do the sugar wash on bottom crust, it didn't seem necessary.  I also used equal parts raspberries and blueberries to make a heaping 4 cups of fruit, and a scant 3/4 cups of sugar.  I'm confidant though this would be just as good if I'd followed the recipe exactly.  I'll definitely make this again.

I cheated by using premade crusts but it was still delicious nonetheless.  Next time I will use a bit more sugar as I found it a little tart.

Delicious! The filling set just right and the fruit flavor was excellent. I did add a 1 inch knob of grated ginger to the filling, which was nice with the lemon peel. Also, add 2 T shortening to the crust for the bast texture.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone agreed that it was a very good pie. My husband requested I make it again this week. New favorite pie.

The flavor on this one is wonderful. It does not cut well, that is the reason for my three star rating. I used a different pie crust recipe. I used about a bag and a half of frozen mixed berries. I completely substituted honey in place of the sugar. Again, love the taste!
