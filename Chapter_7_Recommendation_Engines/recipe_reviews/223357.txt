It is not typical that I try new recipe that hasn't been reviewed before.  I am so glad I gave this a try.  The best part about this dish is the fact that sauce is optional.  It was a slight bit confusing that pasta sauce is in the ingredients list when it is baked without, but I cannot rate this any less than giving it the 5 star rating it deserves, and totally understood.  I recommend adding the warmed sauce after it comes out of the oven on your individual serving plates, rather than putting all the sauce on and baking it, which may be assumed.  Left overs will stay more fresh if sauce is added right before putting it in the microwave.  So delicious!

A great recipe! I bought an eggplant not really knowing what I was going to make with it, and I'm so glad I found this recipe. I wasn't sure how the rolling and everything would work, but the recipe was spot on! We added some other ingredients to the ricotta filling (bacon and spinach) mostly because we had ingredients we needed to use, but it would have been just as good without! Wonderful!

This was SOOO good! A delicious twist on eggplant Parmesan. I followed the directions exactly, but used totally different ingredients for the cheese mixture because I wanted to use food I already had. I used about 3 ounces of grated Parmesan, 2 cloves minced garlic, 4 ounces of fresh feta crumbles and a tablespoon of cream cheese softened, to make sure the cheese mixture stuck together well. I also added a little thinly sliced green onion, salt, pepper, a sprinkle of garlic powder, & a sprinkle of cayenne. It was the best recipe I've made in a while & hubs loved it too!

I thought the hardest part was cutting thin slices evenly down the length of the eggplant. If anyone has any tips on this, please share! However, I used the slices that were not going to make the cut by dicing them up and adding them to the cheese mixture. Turned out great and gave the cheese mixture a little more substance.

All I can say is Wow! I made this exactly the way it's described, except for adding lots of garlic and Italian seasoning to the cheese mixture. This is the best eggplant parmesan I have had anywhere! Kudos to the chef! The eggplant flavor and texture comes through great without being bitter. And it is fun to make! Needs salt at the end. My son and I love it, and he does not like eggplant.

Made this for family of 5 ...actually doubled the recipe hoping to have some leftovers for following day. Should have tripled. There was NOTHING left - it was that delicious.  I did not make any major changes - just took liberties with my  family's personal taste choices when seasoning the cheese stuffing...lots of garlic, italian seasoning, parmesan,  basil, pepper etc.  As suggested, served the marinara on the side. 
This recipe is great because it allows for variation.  Can not wait to make this again.

Very good.  Made it (slightly) healthier by breading with wheat flour, egg whites, and whole wheat bread crumbs, then baking instead of frying and it came out perfect.  Thanks!

I added chopped fresh basil. I think drained chopped frozen spinach would be good, too. Nice dish!  Italian comfort food!

I baked with sauce drizzled over the eggplant roll also topped with mozzarella  cheese, why not.  Did add more spices, tarragon usual Italian stuff, and garlic to mixture.  My wife does't like red sauce so I made these in cavatini dishes and her's was topped with an Alfredo sauce.  Since I saw green in the picture I added spinich (frozen) She really liked it as did I.
I use this same basic stuffing but stuff giant pasta sea shells covered with red and white sause.  The eggplant is just a variation.

Delicious. I probably won't make it often because it really was quite a bit of work with all the steps. However, it's a marvelous dish!

Delicious! I baked the eggplant instead of frying it, and added fresh chopped basil to the filling. Otherwise I made as per the recipe. My sister, nephew, and I inhaled it. I saw some people say the filling was a little bland, but I think that’s more to do with ricotta than there being something deficient in the recipe. I love ricotta so I thought it was perfect.

Made it according to original recipe first.  Had to do it again adding spinach and more garlic to the filling.  Neighbors raved.  Also did not add tomato sauce the 2nd time.  used as a side dish instead of potato.

I decided to lay the slices out with layers of sauce and the cheese mixture like a lasagna. I also baked the eggplant instead of frying the slices. I'm sure that the recipe as instructed would have been delicious as well.

I had been busy making other recipes in the kitchen all day so when it came time to roll them I made the time saving decision to lay them out in layers instead. I do want to try it rolled as well someday.

I made a half-recipe and used an Asiago-Parmesan-Romano combo that I had on hand.  To that, I also added a little Italian seasoning for flavor and some dried parsley. After stuffing the fried eggplant slices with the cheese mixture, I just gently folded them, not completely rolling up, so the cheese was exposed about an inch. Because of that, I didn't put, "seam side down" as was directed in the recipe; I just laid them on their side (like open pierogis :) . Cooking time worked well, and I tried one with a small amount of store-bought marinara sauce and parmesan cheese. I can see adding a little spinach to the cheese mixture, too. Thanks for  this enjoyable and different recipe!

My husband spent the afternoon asking what sides we would have with dinner because “I’m not really an eggplant fan...” this same man had the biggest portion, went back for seconds and kept watch over the left overs like they owed him money. Kids also raced about it and my daughter loves the idea of a meatless meal. 

I Modified the filing to include several spices as well as mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses. I followed the instructions for the filling  and just added about a cup each of the extra cheeses to and stirred it really well - it made more of a thick paste that stuck to the eggplant really well when preparing them for the oven. .i followed everything else pretty closely except I added seasonings to the flour as well as the egg and I added a cup of grated Kraft  Parmesan/Romano  to the bread crumb mix. 

Overall this was a huge hit with my skeptical family and I just made an eggplant lover out of a very picky man!  Thanks for sharing, I can’t wait to make for guests!

These are very good, easy to make and they tasted good. Made no changes to the recipe, except the cheese I used parmesan cheese instead. My husband was happy, with them.

we have made this a number of times, well before I saw it listed here.  This has been a staple for our family that was made by our grandmother and likely her grandmother before that.  All I can say is...try it.  You will love it.  It is an awesome way to eat eggplant.  The only thing I would add is a nice Chianti...

This dish was a hit at my house.  A little time consuming, but very easy to make.  Hubby said it was well worth the wait.  I read one review that said it was bland, and that's my biggest fear when cooking with ricotta cheese.  So I modified it a bit.  I had a few left overs to use on hand from pizza night, so I added chopped green onions, chopped black olives, a little bit of fresh chopped cilantro, chopped green jalapenos, and chopped mushrooms.  I folded in Italian seasoning, a few dashes of hot red pepper flakes, parsley, onion powder and just a touch of garlic salt.  I had about 2 cups of left over Hunt's spaghetti sauce (garlic and herb) and made a chunky sauce to serve on the side.  (I always jazz that up with green bell pepper, white onion, garlic and a fresh tomato all thinly chopped).  I wanted the crisp eggplant to keep it's crunch so I just put a dollop of that sauce here and there, but for the most part kept it separate to serve on the side. But other than those additions, I stayed true to the recipe and I'll be making this again some time.  It did make a lot BTW.  So I might end up freezing half of this.   Served with fresh soft french bread toasted with garlic butter and mozzarella cheese and a tossed salad.  Outstanding!

I made this as per original recipe, but I did underestimate the size of a large eggplant so the rolling was not great.  Next time I will try with a much bigger eggplant, a little more Romano cheese and garlic. Spinach seems like it would be a nice addition as well.  It was okay as written and since I had time it was fun to make, but I was hoping for a little more flavor.

Made this for dinner last night.  Liked it a lot, but the odd thing is the recipe has no parmesan in it.  I added mozza before adding the pasta sauce and then sprinkled parmesan on top before baking.  Next time I won't roll the eggplant, just layer it because there was a lot of the cheese stuffing left over and it tasted so good that I want to use all of it.  Only gave it 4 stars because I changed it a bit.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I followed the recipe directions on how to prepare the eggplant and found they worked just great.  I added browned ground Italian sausage, one thawed and drained box of chopped spinach, and just a little cayenne pepper to my stuffing.  It was fabulous!

Very good. Mixed chopped fresh garlic with Ricotta and added some crumbled cooked Italian sausage too. I didn't dip eggplant in flour only egg then bread crumbs. Was delicious and will definitely make it again.

I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added some sauteed onion, sweet bell pepper and spinach to the cheese mixture. It is very tasty and my husband likes it too!

It was a hit with our 5 1/2 year old!  made it per the recipe. Just a little bland for our taste.  Will make it again and add spinach to it and a few more seasonings!

Even the family liked this one. I had tried another recipe a couple of years ago and no one liked it, so I was reluctant to try again but this one is great. I used Italian flavored bread crumbs and added a package of thawed spinach that I squeezed until it was dry. I also just layered the fried pieces in the pan versus trying to "stuff" each piece. Great recipe; I will make this one again.

This was delicious! I used Panko break crumbs and added extra garlic. I would suggest using a pasta sauce that doesn't have lots of flavors. The flavors in my sauce were overpowering and took away from the eggplant. I think it would even be good without sauce. I'll definitely be making this again!

Pretty good!  Made as written but added spinach to the filling.  Needs spiced/kicked up a notch.  Slightly bland n mushy.

Really very good! A little labor intensive for a weeknight after work. Next time I think I might do the eggplant the night before, grill it and do it as a lasagna. I think the smokey flavor would lend itself well to the eggplant. I will make this again but do want to play with it a bit.

Very delicious. I used mozzarella instead of Romano because it is what I had at the time. I also used fresh spinach in the cheese mixture. Next time I'll pick up some Romano and see how it is. My boyfriend who hates eggplant loved this dish, so its a win!

This was so good! Recipe is about 1/2 cup heavy on flour requirements and because of modified food starch in the ricotta at my local store, allergies, I substituted with cottage cheese and OhMyGoodness!! I have tried a lot of recipes from this site and loved most of them.. this might be my favorite!!!!

I couldn’t find a large eggplant. There’s only two of us so, that was ok. My planks came out uneven. I followed the recipe but, had to layer them. I also added a a little spinach and garlic to the cheese mixture. It still was great.

Fantastic recipe for meat free Monday, just used cheddar cheese instead of Romano as that's what was in my fridge. My husband really enjoyed this dish. It's creamy, crispy and very tasty.
