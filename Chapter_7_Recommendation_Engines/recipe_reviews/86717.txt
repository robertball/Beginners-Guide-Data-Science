this is a good basic recipe, and i have made something like it several times before.  I omit the pasta sauce, flour and water (since i usually use frozen beans)...ADD 1/4 c chopped onions, 1-2 garlic cloves, 1/2 tsp of thyme, 1/8 tsp chili powder (or to taste), 1/4 tsp cumin, a sprinkling of pepper, and garlic or onion salt to taste.  sometimes i'll serve it with a baked potato, but most of the time this is an all in one meal that takes 15 minutes in a pot!  my hubby adds hot sauce to it once its in his bowl, but other wise everyone loves this dish.

This is a very good recipe although I did change it some. I increased the water to 2 cups and did not add the green beans to the sauce mixture as the family did not think the idea of green beans in tomato sauce would be very good and I had to agree. I served this over fluffy mashed potatoes.

This was okay but nothing special -- might have been better with onions or garlic or something.

I thought this was a great basic recipe, and easy.  I was looking for something to make with diced tomatoes, smoked sausage, and rice because it was what I had in the house.  I browned 14 oz of smoked sausage in 2tbsp butter and 1/2 tbsp minced garlic.  I didn't use any tomato sauce so I only added 1/2 cup of water and also only 1/2 lbs of green beans, and mine were frozen.  I spiced it up with 1/2 Tbsp basil, 1/2 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes.  Served it over rice, but it would be good over pasta too.  It turned out great, the only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because I altered it a bit!

I thought this recipe was very tasty, as did my husband. Its not anything gourmet, but definitely very satisfying. I added a can of diced green chiles with the tomatoes, and I think it had a nice flavor. I served it over brown rice with green beans on the side. Thanks for the recipe! :)

Sorry, but we really didn't care for this.  While cooking, it tasted very bland, and added onion, garlic, salt and other spices just to give the sauce flavor.  Not our Cup of tea.

Very easy and delicious. I served it once on hoagie buns & another time over rice. It was a huge success with my family & I enjoyed it as well. I'll definately make it again!!

Very good basic recipe!  Tons of potential.  I added canned green beans, along with a bag of frozen bell pepper and onion mix.  I substituted regular diced tomatoes for ones with green chilis.  Family loved it!

I did change it quiet a bit, I added bell peppers, diced unions and garlic salt and towards the end I added a splash of red wine.  Awesome!!!

This recipe is fast and has a great flavor! I added some creole seasoning to spice it up a bit and served over rice with a side of green beans. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is perfect for personalization-  I gave it some style by adding zucchini, yellow squash, onion, garlic, extra sauce and water, extra bouillon (I used chicken base, not beef), and a healthy dose of Italian seasonings.  Served over mashed potatoes.  The outcome was a very tasty 4*, but I'll rate 3* since it required help as written.
