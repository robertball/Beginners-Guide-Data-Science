We have contacted the submitter of this recipe, and there was a typo in the amount of butter. We have changed it to 1/3 cup. We apologize for any inconvenience.

I thought it turned out fairly well!  I would increase the butter to 3/4 to 1 cup in the crust/crisp portion instead of the 1/3 cup.  I used 1/2 cup, and it was still a little dry, not crumbly.  Also, I think the recipe has too MUCH crisp/crust.  You could also leave the butter at 1/2 cup and cut the flour and brown sugar back to 2 cups each instead of 2 1/2 cups.  Now for the RHUBARB portion, it was a bit sour in combination with the sweet of the crust.  Also just a tad runny after I let it cool awhile (1 hr), so maybe increase the corn starch to 5 T (I used 4 T instead of 1/4 cup).  And lastly, I increased the baking time to 40 to 45 minutes.  :-)  Be sure to place something on the rack below the baking pan as this recipe does seem to bubble over like a pie would.

I thought the pie turned out just fine. But I have to say.. like some others who have used this recipe, I had to add a whole bunch of butter to even form a dough. I tripled the amount of butter the recipe suggests. It's still kinda crunchy but I don't think it's dry. This recipe is great. For the bakers who thought the rhubarb was too sour compared to the sweet crust... leave out a little sugar from the curst and for the rhubarb -> place all the chopped rhubarb in a microwavable bowl, pour a little water on the bottom of the bowl, microwave the rhubarb for 2-3 minutes on high in one minute intervals. The steam from the water should make the rhubarb a bit softer and not so sour after baking it in the oven. I also put a little more corn starch on the sugary mixture, it wasn't runny at all when I tasted the pie the following day. I cooked the pie for 45 minutes. Thank you for this easy recipe, it's delicious.

I read all the reviews first, but was still confused by the amount of butter. 1/3 cup is too little and the rhubarb was still crunchy after 35 minutes of baking. I would double the cooking time and add more butter for the topping. A little more cornstarch for the sauce wouldn't hurt either.

This is wonderful!  The crust is yummy...I had plenty of it, and used some of it on top of an apple pie.  I highly recommend trying it, especially for someone who's never eaten rhubarb before.

I think the flour should be reduced to 1/3 cup!  Way too much topping/crust for this recipe.  Cook the cornstarch mixture until it turns clear.  If not cooked long enough, the acid from the rhubarb breaks it when it bakes.  I also baked it longer.

I read all your warnings before starting this recipe. I added about 1 1/2 cups of butter for the topping/crust- 1/3 is not enough! It tasted good but the center was runny and some of the rhubarb was still crunchy (baked for 30 min.) Next time I will add more cornstarch/flour to the center and bake it for a little longer (or cut the chunks of rhubarb finer.

When I took this crisp out of the oven it had pools of butter on top. I thought three cups seemed like a lot, but followed the recipe anyway. It has a good taste. I am going to try using three sticks next time I make it.

I cut the recipe in half, and used more butter (1/2 cup), less than 1 cup white sugar, and 1/4 cup cornstarch (by mistake I added too much, but it worked just fine!).  I also microwaved the rhubarb - cut up like celery - for 3 minutes, stirring after 3 minutes.  Baked for about 50 minutes in a 9 x 7 x 2 1/2 (tall) pyrex dish - it did not bubble over with a tall dish.  Thank you so much for this recipe - I haven't had Rhubarb in a long time and this was soooooo good!  Maybe I'll plant some of my own rhubarb now!

I agree the butter to dry ingredient ratio was WAY off and I didn't read the reviews before baking (TSK, TSK) this recipe - very disappointing and a waste of good rhubarb!

This recipe turned out delicious!!!!! I put 1 cup of butter in instead of 1/3 cup, and it seemed like the perfect amount! And I only used 6 cups of rhubarb and it was plenty. My family could not get enough of it! If your looking for a rhubarb crisp, this is it.

I didn't have enough Rhubarb so I added some strawberries and blueberries as fillers. Everything else the same and it was delish, my kids are asking for me to make more. Today I'm making rhubarb rashberry and mango crisp. I'll let you know how it turns out!

I don't know what I did wrong.  The bottom was like glue and the top was like cooked flour.  It looked to me like there was not enough butter compared to dry ingredients.  It ended up in the garbage.

Whole family loved it!  Did increase the butter to Lille over 1/2 cup.  Also had closer to 12 cups rhubarb.  Maybe this made the difference.  It was delicious!

When I saw this recipe, I thought it was just like great grandma's... same cooked syrup sauce... the ingrediants were all correct... however, not enough butter.... the crumb crust was dry and floury... the taste was there... but not the texture of the old fashioned Rhubarb crisp.  Will have to dig out grandma's next time.

This was fantastic!  I like cinnamon so I sprinkled more cinnamon over the rhubarb.  Also, I found mine needed to cook for nearly an hour.  Pull it out of the oven after you see it bubbling around the edges.  I didn't have any problems with the crust and topping being to dry b/c the rhubarb cooked down enough!  Delicious!

Okay, regarding the butter. 3/4cup is the exact amount needed.  Also I baked mine for an hour.  My husband and I think this is the best crisp we have ever tried.  Just make the adjustment and you will love it!

Oh, I wished that I had read all the reviews before wasting all my precious rhubarb -- I follow recipes just like they're written.  I had way too much of the "crumbs" so I didn't use all of them, but it was so dry and masked the taste of the rhubarb -- all we could taste was the flour mixture and the oatmeal.  I may try it again next year when the rhubarb is back in season.

This recipe needs work. When I took it out of the oven it looked like a big heap of brown flour. It probably tastes fine, but I'm not taking it to tonight's party as planned.  It doesn't look good.

While the taste was good, the result was too soupy, and the topping too sugary. I've had much better.  Needs more cornstarch or tapioca. Try a different recipe rather than this one.

This was one of the best crisps I have ever made. Loved the crisp on the bottom as well as the top.  My daughter and son in law came for a visit and there was none left.  They absolutly loved it.

I don't know what went wrong or if there is an error in the ingredient listing but it turned out to appear to be "soup".  I doubted the amount of butter it called for but didn't make any adjustments.  It just kept boiling in the oven so we'll try it as an ice cream topping---

This makes a huge batch. I was going to scale it down, but we had a lot of rhubarb so we used the original portions, but it definitely serves a lot! The butter amount, as mentioned before, is not correct. I used 2 sticks of butter, but I could have probably used a little bit more. Otherwise, it turned out really good! I would scale it down a bit and add more butter if I made it again!

Will not make this again. The bottom crust  and topping were very dry. I had to doctor the top with a little more brown sugar and butter so as not so dry. Filling was nice with the syrup added.

I followed the recipe to the letter.  The filling was watery and, therefore, the crust and topping was soggy.

I actually think this is a recipe I submitted a long time ago. Any time you have something like cornstarch in a recipe play around with that to get correct thickness 1 cup of sugar is better if your using 2 cups of water you will need more cornstarch after adding more if it still isn't right put more heat on it.that is what I did last night and mine came out perfect

Mine turned out VERY dry.  It came out of the oven looking exactly like it went in.  I wondered if my rhubarb was dry/reedy, and that was the problem... Just f.y.i.

The crisp didn't cook for me. I even cooked it 20 extra minutes. I'm going back to mom's recipe.

There is twice as much flour  and oats as needed and not near enough butter. I upped the butter to 2/3 cup but even that was no where near enough! When I pulled it out of the oven after baking it a lot longer then stated because otherwise it would have been raw in the middle, the topping still looked powdery dry . Since I was taking it to a potluck I couldn't really throw it out and start over . I tightly wrapped it in foil and insulated the top with towels to hold the steam in.  This helped moisten up the powder but never again. Way too much topping and bottom layer which is unnecessary in my opinion anyway.

I just tried this recipe and the amount of butter needs to be increased. I used 1/2 cup with the oat mixture and it still came out very dry. I would say 1 cup should be sufficient.

First of all, I am NOT a baker, so I don't have any intuitive ideas about what would work/not work/be better, etc.  When I was mixing the crumb part, however, I could clearly see that the amount of butter just didn't look right.
I added a small amount more, mixed, then added a very small amount more.

What I had when I finished was certainly not a "crisp".  The flour/oat/sugar part was fine on the bottom (cuz of the moisture I suppose) but it was just flour, oats, and sugar on the top.

I made this recipe and was very disappointed.  I think that the allrecipes staff needs to review it one more time.  I'm not a huge cook, so I follow recipes as written.  I knew there wasn't enough butter, but figured it was right.  Obviously, I didn't read the reviews which was a mistake.  Not real happy that I wasted the last of my rhubarb!!!!

I made the recipe as written, and I didn't care for the texture. I expected a crumble and this was too floury.  HOWEVER, the flavor was WONDERFUL!!! (it's the flavor that counts anyway, right??) I'm glad I tried it and will make it again.  Thanks for sharing!

Pretty good....I used frozen rhubarb and drained excess water before preparing recipe. Like others I added a bit more butter. I liked the fact that there is oat mix in bottom of pan. Perfect consistency for a crisp
