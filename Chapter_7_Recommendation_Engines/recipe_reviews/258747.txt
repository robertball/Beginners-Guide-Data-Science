I really like the porridge, especially the texture, but I found it too sweet for my taste.  I will go with a little less sugar next time I make it. Otherwise, yummy!

Great recipe! Easy to follow & straightforward. It came out delicious! My husband likes to start his day with porridge and this recipe is my new go-to,  very quick & yummy.
