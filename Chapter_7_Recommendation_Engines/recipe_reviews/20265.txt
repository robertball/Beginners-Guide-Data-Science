This was the best bread pudding I've ever made OR tasted. However, I did change a few things: Instead of 4 cups of milk I replaced with 2 cups of whipping cream and 2 cups of half-n-half. I also added salt and cinnamon to taste and since I'm not a huge fan of butterscotch I did half butterscotch chips and half white chocoloate chips. Nestle works great. And instead of regular loaf bread, I bought French baguette style bread. I also baked mine for way over the recommended 45 minutes..more like 1 hour and 30 miuntes. I don't like soupy bread pudding in the middle so I cooked mine until it was more solid. Let me tell you this bread pudding was so crispy, buttery and delicious that it was hard to share. I ate some for breakfast lunch and dinner!!

Definately not enough stars!  I have made this many times.  I changed it a bit though.  I use a good raisin bread and cinnamon chips.  I also double the cinnamon and add a generous amount of nutmeg.  Everyone raves!  This is one of the best things I have ever made or eaten.  You must try this!  I can't begin to describe how amazing this is.  Oh, I don't recommend reheating the next day, it tastes much better cold, after it has been in the fridge over night!  Thank you so much for this amazing recipe!!!!

I am a huge bread pudding fan, and I think the addition of butterscotch chips here is key.  It's really a great idea.  I did, however, make a couple of changes.  I used cinnamon bread and added golden raisens (soaked in whiskey beforehand).  Oh, and also I did use just 1 cup of sugar (instead of 2 cups).  I didn't think it needed so much sweetness, and that was the right choice for me.  The final product I was got was out of this world!  Thanks!

OH   MY   GOODNESS!!!   I have made this 4 times in the last four weeks for different groups of company each time, and if I owned the rights to this recipe I could get rich.  A couple of changes: I use a great brand of butterscotch chips called Guittard, a "buttery" butterscotch, the other was waxy by comparison. I also use only about 3/4 cup of chips, and push them down under the surface of the pudding before baking, they melt better into the pudding. For the bread I use half a loaf of the Sara Lee Cinnamon Bread and about 6 large fresh potatoe rolls, and use my Kitchen Aid so everything is well smoomshed. Using real butter to coat the dish seems to add something, instead of just spraying it with Pam. The sauce I use is the Whisky Sauce found on this site, but I substitute the Whisky with Brandy.  This recipe is Splendiferious!

Awesome. I made this for breakfast as a french toast bake and it was delightful. I did cut the brown sugar in half. Instead of butterscotch chips, I used 1/2 cup of butterbrickle chips. I also put in some dried cranberry crasins and coconut. I also sprinkled the top with cinnamon and sugar before baking.  This is such a nice basic recipe and you can change this by adding your favorite things. I made the buttermilk sauce on this site also to go with it which is a very nice sauce and not as sweet like a caramel sauce.  This makes a large pan so we had a couple pieces and then I cut up servings and drizzled with buttermilk sauce and put them in the freezer. They heat up well and is a great breakfast item or dessert.  Now to keep out of the freezer.

IMO this should be called: "To Die For Butterscotch Bread Pudding".  If I could give it more than 5 stars I certainly would.  I am dumbfounded at how easy and delicious this recipe is.  I used French Bread (day old) and followed the recipe to the "T".  You are a genius Margaret!  Thank you so much! :)

Surprisingly good bread pudding. I had never made bread pudding before so I was suspicious of its outcome. it turned out that it was easy to make and tasted great. Its also a good base recipe for future customization. I made sure the bread was good and stale (meaning dry) so it would soak up all that creamy goodness! Bewarned, it will rise when baking and fall as it cools, so be prepared for a little overflow. I baked it in ramekins sitting on a sheet pan, so cleanup was easy (who wants to clean the bottom of the oven!).

This is a fabulous recipe!  Per the suggestion of others, I cut the brown sugar by a quarter cup. Then, the only other change I made was using fresh bread, since I didn't have any thing else on hand.  I did, however, use a French Parisian Bread (very hard crust with soft inner).  The result got rave reviews.  My husband, who doesn't even like bread pudding, said this recipe was a keeper.  Truly excellent!!!

Apart from adding a little more vanilla, I made this as written, and it was absolutely fantastic! I wouldn't change a thing. Thanks so much, Margaret. Outstanding!!

This was some of the best bread pudding I have ever eaten! I'm a sauce lover & this was so tasty on it's own that I think it's best w/out any sauce. I used very stale french bread torn in small pieces & since the bread was so stale I let it soak for about 30 minutes before baking & the texture of the pudding was perfect. I sprinkled some pecan chips on the surface before baking. (Next time I think I will try some rum soaked raisins as suggested by others.)

DeLisH!!  OMG I am so glad I found this recipe, it is simply Sinful and you will not be disappointed.  I followed the recipe completely and was so pleased with the results.  I made this to bring to a Thanksgiving dinner and it was a complete hit and the first desert to disappear...so many people came back for 2nds.      Here is the thing I wish I would have known...to place a baking sheet under the baking dish.  This bread pudding rises in the oven, which caused mine to overflow a bit.      This is also great the next day, you can even serve it at a brunch as a baked french toast.    Try this you will not be disappointed, try it the first time as it is and then the next time alter it or enhance it to your liking.    EnJoy...

As is - 4, but with a few personal tweaks I give this recipe a 10. Way way too sweet. Cut the brown sugar to 1 1/4 and still too sweet. 3/4 cup is the right amount for us. Cut butter down to 1 stick (greased the pan with it, then melted the rest) and used 1/4 cup applesauce for the other stick of butter. You don't even miss it. Leftover bread odds from the freezer worked great. Added a little cinnamon and nutmeg and 1 extra egg. Yum! Can't wait to try it cold in the morning. Convection baking: 335 for 1 hour = perfect!

This shoud be at least a 10!  I've made this twice, just as the recipe says except that I baked it in a large crockpot and it was done in between 2-3 hours (no room in my oven).  Amazing. Delicious. Dangerously good. Thanks for such a great winning recipe!

Best bread pudding ever! I did put 1/2 less cups of sugar and it was still very sweet. Put a little hazelnut creamer and I also baked it for a little over an hour, until the top started to get brown. Delicious!!!

I made this in my slow cooker and it was DELICIOUS!!  It was really easy!  I mixed all the ingredients together and used butter flavor non-stick cooking spray and sprayed the sides and bottom of the slow cooker.  Then, I poured the mixture in and let it cook for 2 hours on high.  I used the entire bag of butterscotch pieces because it wasn't that much more than what the recipe called for (and I love them!)  YUMMMMY!  Thanks for the recipe!

you can judge me if you want to for the 3 star rating, but i made the mistake of following other's suggestions rather than do the original. i used heath bits instead of butterscotch and reduced the brown sugar to 1.5 cups and it wasn't sweet enough for me. i had to make a vanilla sauce to go on top of it to save it. the thing that i didn't like about the heath was that they melted right in to the point where i couldn't taste them. if i get the urge to make this again, i will follow the directions, as written!
--------------------------
REVIEW UPDATE!
I had tons of sweet hawaiian rolls getting stale so I decided to make this again, but followed the recipe this time, mostly. :) (I subbed applesauce for half the butter) It was heavenly with RAVE reviews! But now I see why people reduced the sugar because butterscotch is a lot richer than heath bits. So for future, I will most likely reduce the brown sugar to 1.5 cups, do butterscotch chips, and continue to sub the butter with half applesauce. Oh and I DO NOT recommend using the hawaiian rolls because they get mushier than other breads.

We loved it!  I had left over rolls ( wheat and white) that I removed the crust  and some raisin English muffins.  It was even better the next day when we reheated in a ungreased Teflon skillet to get more crusty texture. That was my 19 yr old son's idea because he loved the edge pieces.  My husband said save the recipe, I said yup already did!

This bread pudding was the hit of my party! People kept saying how they'd never liked bread pudding -- until now!  It was so simple to make (next time I'll add raisins). I followed the recipe to a "T" except I baked it for 10 extra minutes to get a more solid consistency. The extra time in the oven did not dry it out, but did give it those wonderful caramelized edges that everyone was fighting over. I let it set for 30 minutes and served it warm (in a goblet), topped with French Vanilla ice cream.

My husband adores bread pudding, always orders it if it is on the menu at restaurants.  So when we had my parents over to celebrate Father's Day with us, I thought I would try this out. I followed it to a 'T' with the exception of the cooking time - I baked it WAYYY longer than the recommended time (although, covered with foil after the first hour) my total cooking time was probably somewhere around 90 to 105 minutes.  It just seemed way too soggy in the middle after an hour, and I wanted it to crisp up a bit more.  The only other thing I felt was the butterscotch flavor is kind of lost with the chips melting - its definitely a sweet pudding - but I personally was looking forward to the butterscotch flavor.  (Although - nobody else seemed to care - I am giving this 5 stars b/c everyone was raving).  The next time I would serve warm topped with vanilla ice cream or vanilla sauce, and maybe a little butterscotch syrup drizzled on top of that.  Oh by the way the bread I used was an 8 oz. loaf of french bread - to make up for the missing 2+ oz. the recipe calls for, I used half a plain bagel, worked perfectly.

Yum . . . and it smells phenomenal baking.  I used a challah bread I had made several days before.  It is a little on the sweet side so I will probably add just a smidgeon less brown sugar the next time.

Absolutely deeeeelicious!  I used a 16 ounce loaf of French bread cuz that's all the store had & it came out perfect!  I've always had bread pudding with some type of sauce on top, but this recipe honestly doesn't need it.  Like other reviewers have said, it is even better cold from the fridge, when the butterscotch sets up hard again.  Everyone just loved this recipe!!

My sister and I have been trying to replicate a bread pudding recipe that we tried while down in Florida, and this is definitely as close as we've gotten!  I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it got absolutely fantastic reviews!  We did add some raisins (not soaked in anything - I guess we drank it all.  Ha.) and served it with the Whiskey Sauce from this site.  I also threw in the entire bag of butterscotch chips because, well, why not? Completely out of this world and wouldn't change a thing.  This also reheats really well.  Thanks for ending our search for the perfect bread pudding!

OMG this is amazing! I have no doubt it is delicious as written but wanted to make this as used what I had on hand. I used some pumpkin pie soy milk for 1/2 the required milk and the rest whole milk. I used 1.5 cups brown sugar, added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp chai spice blend. I did add the whole cup of butterscotch chips.. For the bread I weighed a whole wheat loaf I backed a few days ago and cubed it and added 1 lg. grated apple.  I divided it into two pans and in spite of my intention to have a big salad for lunch I am having THIS! w/a scoop of bluebell vanilla ice cream on the side. Decadent and amazing! Good enough for Thanksgiving~

loved this recipe!  it is rich but that is what i was looking for.  i added one mashed banana (just because it was super ripe and i had nothing to do with just one banana) and a few dashes of cinnamon.  definitely a recipe i'll make again!!!  next time i'll add a peach or two for a different flavor.

One of our favorites. Make this whenever I have enough leftover bread for a batch. Don't always have butterscotch chips, but as an alternative, I put in coarsely grated apple (quicker than slicing it up) and add a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg spice to the mix. It's fantastic!

This is the best bread pudding I've ever made.  I also cooked it just like they said, like a jiggling thigh. : )  Moist, sweet, just great.  Next time I will lessen the sugar, but that is my taste.

Outstanding recipe!  The only thing I changed was that I added a bit of cinammon and nutmeg but other than that I did exactly what the recipe called for.  I am usually one to replace milk with whipping cream or heavy cream, not this time and you don't need too.  I did cook it for 1.5 hours to make sure it was cooked all the way thru.  Super good!

Whenever we go out to a buffet for dinner, I always get the bread pudding. It is my favorite dessert. This recipe is the best I've ever tasted! I used heavy whipping cream for the milk simply because I was trying to use it up. That is the only thing that kept me from eating a rediculous amount. (thinking about the calories) Anyway this is fantastic. Even better straight from the fridge the next day!

Great recipe, but next time I am going to cut the sugar in half. If you leave the sugar as is, you will get more than 8 servings. The sweetness really makes you only want a little at time.

I made this to bring to a dinner party, and it was delicious!  I threw in a half-bag of chocolate-toffee brickle (heath bar) just for fun.  I served it with whipped cream and caramel sauce, which I think made it a little too sweet (and I have a serious sweet tooth!), so next time I'll serve just with whipped cream.  Delicious!!

Despite the disturbing image of baking until it reaches 'thigh wiggle' consistency, this dessert is comfort food nirvana.  I added chopped nuts, rum-soaked raisins and cinnamon and it was divine served warm with vanilla ice cream.

My dad requested that I made him his favorite dessert; bread pudding. & he love butterscotch so I made him this & made my own caramel sauce that I put on top & he loved it. I also made a small batch for my house & everyone here loves it too. The only thing I did different was that I used coconut milk, white bread & added rasins.

I made this with a pumpkin bread, and it was holy cow amazing!!!!  I really would like to see what it tastes like with normal bread though.  The pumpkin kind of overpowered the butterscotch but it did work ;)  I WILL be making this again :)  Oh, and I actually thirded the recipe and made just a bread sized loaf of the stuff.

This... is... AWESOME.    I ended up splitting it into two pans when I made it, and froze one of them for a few weeks.  Once thawed, reheated in the microwave before eating... it just gets better!!

I dont know why I haven't reviewed this before . I would give it 10 stars if possible. I've made it many times & always have to give the recipe away . This is amazing warm & wonderful cold the next day . Please don't overbake ...I believe that's the key to the goodness the next day . I ALWAYS make a caramel sauce & pour over the warm pudding before serving ! I also use fresh white bread usually ...it works fine . A sprinkle of chopped pecans on the top before it goes in the oven is a good addition now & then . I've been told this is great served hot , with a scoop of vanilla ice cream , but I haven't tried that yet ! Thank you Margaret !

Oh YES!  This is heavenly.  Added a cup of golden raisins, but would have been great without I am sure.  Also added one more egg as I like a stiff bread pudding. Think chopped nuts would be a great addition too.

All I can say about this recipie is that is is absolutely WONDERFUL! This was the first time I have ever made bread pudding and what a great way to start out! It is so moist and flavorful...I couldn't get enough! I made it for my family for Valentines day and it was an absolute hit! I only made a few changes...I reduced the brown sugar to 1 1/2 cups, I also mixed the wet ingredients before I added them to the French Bread and when they were done I topped them with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon. VERY DELICIOUS!

You can taste the calories in this (and it's worth every bite). If it wasn't so terribly unhealthy I'd make it every week. It's the perfect desert for a cold dreary day!

Great base recipe! I added 1 cup of chocolate chips, a squirt of each hazelnut and macadamia nut syrups,  doubled the butter, and used half cream and half milk, then served it with a custard sauce and whipped cream and it was delicious! My sister, whom had shown some skepticism over a dessert that had day old bread as an ingredient, went back for seconds! Everyone liked it and I will certainly be making it again!

This was my first attempt at bread pudding and this recipe is terrific. I used a loaf of bread from my bread maker and only 1/2 of the butterscotch chips (because that's all I had on hand!) and it was delicious. Highly recommended.

Wonderful!!  I used a heavy bread from the 'day old' rack at the grocery store.  Also used half and half instead of milk and cut the brown sugar down to 3/4 cup. (much too sweet if you use 2 cups!)  I drizzled a little butter over the top and sprinkled with about a tablespoon of sugar before baking.  Everyone loved it.  Even my grand kids asked for more - the two year old stating it was "delicious"!

Dry, tasteless, not worth the ingredients I put into it.  Perhaps a nice whiskey sauce would save it (ice cream did  not).

Was excellant!  My changes were to add 1/2 C. Golden raisens (soaked in Wiskey), 1 tsp cinnamon and decrease sugar to 1 C.  Was plenty sweet. I used a loaf of french bread.  I highly recommend this one!  easy and good.

This was a great recipe! Instead of butterscotch I added chopped bittersweet chocolate, a teasppon of nutmeg and cinnammon each and used Semifreddi's cinnammon swirl challah-like bread from Trader Joe's. Delish!!

One of the best and easiest bread pudding recipe ever. I was looking for a bread pudding recipe where I didn't have put it in a bath.  I used up french rolls, used skim milk, unsalted butter (all I had left), added a little salt and just 1 cup of brown sugar.  The butterscotch chips makes it sweet so you don't need the additional cup of brown sugar and you don't need syrup or a sweet sauce for it.  Also baked it for 45 minutes instead of an hour because I like my bread pudding custardy.  Try this recipe, you will surely not be disappointed!!

Loved it! A big hit!  Served it with Creme Anglaise.  A definite keeper.  I did halve the sugar as other reviewers advised and it was plenty sweet enough for us.

I am really not a huge fan of bread pudding, but my husband loves it, so I thought I would try this recipe.  It is very good!  Like others suggested, I cut the brown sugar to 1 cup.  I can't imagine using any more than that...it was plenty sweet!  Since it has a caramel taste to it, I think I might try adding some thinly sliced apples next time.  I plan to make this for our 4th of July celebration!

Wow!  This is sooo good!  The only substitutions I made was to use 2 cups of milk and 2 cups of heavy cream (because I had some I needed to use up), and I also reduced  the brown sugar to 1 cup instead of 2.  It was still very sweet so when I make it again (and yes I will make this again!!!) I will reduce the brown sugar to maybe 1/2 cup.  I took it out of the oven after 50 minutes.  No sauce needed for this bread pudding!

PERFECT ! Here Is what I done .... First off I could not find Challa bread , so I used Kings Hawaiian Bread . This already is sweet , so I cut down the sugar to 1 3/4 cups . I also used 2 cups half and half , then used  1 1/2 cups milk . I ended up using almost all of the 16oz bread to get the "oatmeal type consistency , but I had NO PROBLEM with it being to runny . Mine was done at 45 minutes , so watch your bread close . To make it just a little more sweeter , and mixed up some cinnamon , and sugar and sprinkled on the top once done . With some whip cream this was perfect . My husband loved it , and that amazed me since his mother claims she invented bread pudding ! ... This is a recipe I'm sure will be going to her next dinner invite . Thanks so much for posting .

This was so freaking good! BUT I really think it needs some crunch. The second time I made it, I added walnuts and that was great! Next time Im going to make a crunchy coconut and pecan topping for it. This has great flavor and was much better the longer it sat. YUMMY!!!!

This is extraordinarily DELICIOUS!  I made this for my parents and they just loved it.  I did cook a little longer to achieve the crispy coating.  Also cut down on the sugar and it was plenty sweet.  Next time I will try with cinnamon/raisin breat - this could be used as a breakfast dish.

This pudding was delicious! I couldn't find butterscotch chips so instead I added some caramel filling to the recipe for flavour, and crushed up some butterscotch candy to sprinkle on top. Great consistency! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it dropped after coming out of the oven :( which was probably my fault.

Amazing. Not enough stars for this one! I made a few very small tweaks to the recipe. I did half whipping cream and half whole milk, used challah bread, added some ground cinnamon, and used a combination of mini chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, and butterscotch chips. Served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Just delicious. Will likely be a regular dessert at our Christmas dinners going forward!! Oh, and I can also attest to the fact that this tastes just as good cold as it does warm!

Like other users, I adjusted the recipe slightly - I used a loaf of Challa Bread, used half & half instead of milk, used white chocolate chips, added cinnamon and nutmeg (1 tsp. ea.).  I didn't have enough half & half, so I added refrigerated egg nog (Southern Comfort) and cut back on the sugar slightly (depending on how much you use - it's a judgement call).  I also made a vanilla sauce out of 1/2 cup of each: sugar, brown sugar, whipping cream, butter and one tsp. vanilla - mix all in saucepan, heat to boiling while stirring, and stir in vanilla last.  Excellent recipe.

Amazing! I followed the advice from others and added raisins, cinnamon, a pinch of salt, and a splash of rum. I only used 1 cup of brown sugar, and thought the sweetness level was perfect. I melted some vanilla bean ice cream to use as a sauce.

You pretty much can use ANY bread!  I used leftover sourdough baguette with croissant rolls...incredible!  Too sweet for my taste though...I would reduce the brown sugar to 1 cup as suggested. Fabulous the next day when cold and set.

OMG!!!! This is sooooo good! I used Thomas's Plain Bagels. I had old ones that I needed to use in a hurry. I wasn't sure how it was going to turn out because I have never made bread pudding with bagels before. I love bread pudding to begin with and butterscotch is another big favorite - so I thought this would be great to try with the bagels. Other than the bagels, I followed the recipe just as written. This was just so good! Definitely a keeper!

I followed this recipe to tee except I just couldn't get the thought of butter rum out of my head so I added rum soaked raisins. This was the best bread pudding I have ever had. I added a dollup od whipped cream to the top and devoured it!!! Thank you for this recipe.

This is really yummy.  I've made this a few times now.  I would have given this recipe 5 stars but like others have said 2 cups of brown sugar is too much, so now I used a little less sugar and it's perfect.  Less sugar make this a 5 star recipe!

I have never had bread pudding before, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  WOW!  This was an easy delicious recipe.  I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups as per other posters.  Was perfect!  Thanks for a great new dessert.

Cooked this recipe in a large pottery type crock pot 2 hours on high then turned to low to keep warm until served with vanilla ice cream.  So good.  Adjusted the recipe per other reviewers suggestions: decreased to  1/2 stick butter,decreased the brown sugar by half, all of the butterscotch chips, added 1/4 tsp ground cloves and 1/2 tsp ginger.

I brought this to an all-company breakfast, and it was inhaled. My only change was adding more vanilla as other suggested. I just mixed everything up in my crockpot and put it on "low" for three hours. Because it was a potluck the pot stayed plugged in until noon, and it was even better for dessert after lunch. :>)

Really good.  Very easy to do and we loved the flavor and texture.  I used fresh bread and it didn't matter.  I added pecans to the top about half way through baking (I had forgotten earlier) and it was a really nice touch.  Will definitely make this often.

I made this last night and boy is it a winner!! I chose to add heath bar pieces instead of the butterscotch. Easy to follow instructions and simple pantry ready recipe really made me feel confident but after cooked and served up …I felt like a gourmet!!

I am not a big lover of butterscotch chips so I used Skor pieces.  Yum.  The dessert was a hit with my fussy children.  I bake a lot and kids are not afraid to critique anything so a thumbs up is a rave review.

i never know how many stars to give! i halved this recipe and used sourdough bread (the only kind i had and wanted to get rid of). this was my first time making bread pudding so i don't know how long i'm supposed to cook it exactly. i used an 8"x8" square pan and left it in the oven for ~50+ minutes (i think i didn't have enough bread, so i left it in the oven to dry out more liquid). i mixed it around twice during cooking also. anyway, this pudding was buttery and sweet--very rich. the texture was kind of mushy (except for the edges and top), but i guess that's how it's supposed to be? it is definitely an indulgence if u want some comfort sweets -- high in CALORIES!! very easy to make with simple ingredients.

This bread pudding is awesome!  It is so easy to make and it is so delicious.  Each time I take it to potlucks I get several requests for the recipe.  My husband is not a big bread pudding fan, but he absolutely loves this recipe!

I always like to try new recipes to take to family gatherings, because everyone expects a fabulous dessert when I come.  This dessert went over very, very well.  It was very easy to prepare and used up some leftover bread I had on hand.  This recipe is great!!!

This recipe is the BEST! I am not a huge butterscotch person but it doesn't even matter it's that good.  My coworkers refer to this bread pudding as "CRACK". Only thing I did different was use Cinnamon Raisin Bread. And word to the wise this takes closer to 1 hr 30 min to set. After 1 hr it was too "wiggly". I will make this again and again and again.

Wow.  This is delicious.  I cut in half (used 2 eggs) and baked in an 8x8 pan.  The only change I made was a dash of cinnamon.  I will definitely be making this again!  Fantastic!

This recipe is way too good. I followed the directions of the "most helpful" review using white chocolate chips mixed with the butterscotch chips and raisin bread. I also used half milk and half heavy cream. After taking it to a church event and getting lots of compliments, I made it a second time halving the brown sugar (Splenda).  This is a keeper, though its too rich for too often.  Sorry no photo. It went too fast!

This was very good. I read several reviews before making this. I cut the brown sugar in half and even though I enjoy sweet desserts I found that to be plenty. Because several people mentioned that this seemed "wet", I only used 3 cups of milk. I cooked this on high for 3 hours in my crock pot. Maybe because the crock pot uses a lid, the pudding turned out really moist and tasty with only 3 cups of milk. My bread was very dry before assembling this so I don't think I would ever need more milk. Because of changing the amounts of sugar and milk, I rate this a 4. Will definitely make this again. My bread was multigrain/wheat and we still enjoyed this.

OMG. This recipe has been put on my permanent Go To Dessert list.  Great way to use up old bits & pieces of different breads.  I used skim milk & a mix of leftover rye, white, wheat & pretzel bread and was not sorry to do so! -- NOTE: Next time I make this, I'll try cutting back on the brown sugar and butter simply to make it 'healthier' (yeah ... like that's a priority of mine!).

Awesome recipe!  I did have to put my own 'spin' on it.  Used wheat bread for the health factor......and bumped it up to AMAZING by substituting butterscotch chips for milk chocolate chips!!  This is lick the pan and gotta make another one good!

This was my first attempt at bread pudding and it turned out perfect. I served it at a dinner party for 12 and received rave reviews from everyone. I followed exactly as set out, except that I used a fresh loaf of bakery french bread. I served it with vanilla ice cream. Awesome. I can't wait to serve it again. Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!  I add 1 1/2  Tbsp cinnamon. Then after baking I topped it with Hershy's caramel syrup.  My friends say that Bread Pudding is a bad name for this, it should be called Cinnamon Roll pudding instead.  I also topped it with cream cheese frosting once and they went wild!! comfort food at it's finest.

I made this recipe by memory today due to my computer crashing.  I forgot the butter.  Guess what?  You don't need it!  I also added 1 tsp. maple extract, 1 tsp. cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  This was so good that I had to give it away for fear of eating it all myself.  Just perfect on a rainy cool Autumn day.  Thanks for sharing this lovely recipe.

Yummy! I went against my usual advise of trying without revisions...I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and only used 1/3 cup butterscotch chips for a more subtle flavor.

Awesome! Even my very critical mom loved it!! The only thing I changed was 2 cups condensed milk, 2 cups organic fat free milk. Next time I think I will add golden raisins for texture, but it was delicious as is!!

This was very good. I served it with the sauce from the Peachy Bread Pudding with Caramel Sauce recipe on this site and we really liked it. I halved the recipe, using 6 stale hamburger buns for the bread, 2 eggs and exactly 1/2 each of the other ingredients.

I quartered the recipe and baked it in a jello mold (I'm sorry to say that I didn't take note of the time, though it seems it was close to an hour) at 350. I'm glad that I added some cinnamon and nutmeg, as well as a pinch of salt, following others' advice. I wish I had gone a bit heavier, truthfully. The bread was pumpkin and it paired nicely with the butterscotch chips...wish I had gone heavier with those, too. For some reason the reduced recipe called for only 1/4 cup sugar rather than the correct 1/2 cup, not sugary enough for me but probably pleasant to someone with a less vigorous sweet tooth. I'll make this again, loosely, using the amounts for liquids but tweaking the rest to my own tastes. I will also be trying different flavoring extracts, like maple, orange, and banana with maybe some white chocolate and peanut butter. Nom nom.

I loved this! No one else in my family would try it but they're not fans of bread pudding while I'm a huge fan of it.  I gave some to my father-in-law to take home though, he'll like it.  I used only 1c of the brown sugar but that's the only change I made.  I'll make this again even if it's just for me :)

Love this quick and easy recipe. A tad on the sweet side.  Next time, I won't put as much sugar and less butter.  I also did half butterscotch chips and half skor bits which turned out amazing.

Have made this a few times and it is always amazing! I use light vanilla soy milk instead of cows milk so I omit the vanilla extract and only use 1 cup of b.sugar and it's still very sweet.

Amazing! This dish was the star of my five-course dinner party last night. 1 cup is the perfect amount of butterscotch chips. I followed the recipe as-is, except I used half-and-half instead of milk (calories don't count at parties), and I added cinnamon as per reviewers suggestions. This is a great dinner party dish because you can put it in the oven right before guests arrive and by the time  everyone is ready for dessert the whole kitchen smells heavenly. I served it with warm Creme Anglaise II from this web site and a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream. Perfect!

Awesome!  I'm not the best baker/cook on the planet, so I'm always a bit apprehensive about cooking for others.  But this recipe has been a hit with everyone!  Many people who do not even like bread pudding have asked me for the recipe.  It's SO DANG EASY too!  And you can really make it your own special recipe:  I added about 12 maraschino cherries and tried it with a crusty italian loaf.  My favorite version is with cherries and sourdough bread.  I also cut the sugar by 1/3 cup and use one whole 16oz bread loaf. The standard 8 serving recipe is PLENTY!  You can actually serve about 20 people with that recipe!

Way way too much sugar.  Also, I was expecting the butterscotch chips to come out melted.  It tasted like a sugar pie.  Had one piece, and will not be having any more.

This was awesome.  Following other suggestions I used 1 cup of brown sugar, added some dried fruit, cinnamon, salt, and 2 tbsps. of rum.  Cooked it for 1 1/2 hours - it didn't need any sauce, though I suppose a vanilla cream sauce would go well with it.

This recipe was so delicious and so easy to make. I got rave reviews from my friends. My only modification was to add 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips and 1/2 a cup of white chocolate. I also added some cinnamon.

Delicious! I used only 1/4 cup of sugar and still turned out fantastic - not sweet/not bland. I didn't use any butterscotch (couldn't get any here??), so I put pieces of apple & grated coconut on top. My husband ate 4/5 of the whole pudding (he's English). Thank you, Margaret.

This is an amazing bread pudding! I measured the brown sugar very loosely though, because 2 cups is a lot.  I have a bread maker and tried this recipe with Apple Oat bread and chocolate bread.  This is a recipe that goes to the front of my recipe box!

Holy moly!  I'm so glad I had leftover bread.  Never tried bread pudding before, so I was incredibly surprised.  It has a moist texture, but I wish I had loosely covered the top while baking since it was too crunchy for my liking.  When you first assemble everything, you will notice quite a bit of liquid but I promise the bread will soak it up during baking.  The whole dish even rose a little.  It could probably stand to use 1 cup less sugar, but if you like sweet, you won't mind following the recipe exactly.

This turned out wonderful, my husband loved it! He's the big bread pudding and butterscotch fan around here. I did make a couple of changes. First I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 glass pan. I added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, kept butterscotch chips at 1 C, added 1/2 C vanilla chips, only used 1 egg. I used 1 1/4 C 2% milk, and 1 C heavy cream. I also made a glaze to pour over it that really finished it off. I brought 1/4 C heavy cream, 1/2 C white sugar, 1/8 C butter, 1 tsp vanilla to a boil stirring constantly, and turned down to low stirring for 3 minutes. This is really a perfect amount for an 8x8 batch. Poured over hot bread pudding and it was wonderful. I would make one suggestion I'm going to try next time though. It would be better if the butterscotch and vanilla chips were melted before baking and stirred in. For some reason they didn't melt much in the oven and melted would be better.

Absolutely fantastic!  I followed the suggestions and added in 1 tsp cinnamon and also added in raisins and pecan halves.  My family devoured it like a bunch of sharks!!!  I think next time, I may try adding in chunks of apple to see what that does!!  I cooked mine for less time. I have a convection oven and cooked at 350 for approx 40 mins and it came out beautifully.  Thank you so much for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This is a great recipe with simple ingredients and steps.  I substituted one of the cups of milk with whipping cream, added peacans, and cooked it for 55 min., and it was perfect.  I love bread pudding usually with sauce, but this recipe is so good without sauce.  Top with whip cream and vanilla ice cream.  Enjoy!

I made two version of this for Christmas.  One with butterscotch on homemade cinnamon swirl bread, one with chocolate chips on Swedish chocolate bread w/ black walnuts.  I followed reviewers suggestions and decreased the amount of milk, but I wish I hadn't.  It wasn't quite gooey enough, even with reducing baking time by 10 minutes.  The butterscotch combination was awesome.  The chocolate was a bit too sweet.  I would suggest using less brown sugar when making the chocolate version or when using a sweeter bread.  Next time I think I'll make a bourbon or rum glaze topping and some fresh whipped cream.

Oh, my.  One word: DEADLY!  It went together really easily and baked up perfectly.  My husband, who is a butterscotch fiend, absolutely loved it.  It was a bit too sweet for me, as I'm not the butterscotch fan that he is, but I'd probably replace the chips with some sliced apples or pears, or a combination of both, and maybe some cinnamon, sugar and nutmeg.  YUM!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Truly delicious, especially for those unfamiliar with bread pudding. I cut the sugar- 3/4 cup was the right amount for us too, including my sweet-tooth hubby. The "thigh wiggle" detail in the instructions makes me laugh...thanks, Margaret =)

I've made this several times and it's always a success. However, I use only 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar and ALWAYS use french bread. The texture of the french bread is great for a pudding, not "soggy" like a sandwich bread. Also, I like to sprinkle a small amount of chips on top because it makes for a better presentation in the dish.

I prepared this wonderful dessert with half and half instead of milk and I used white chocolate chips instead of the butterscotch because there arent many lovers of butterscotch. I also used half a loaf of pepperidge farm white bread and half a loaf of the cinnamon raisin bread. I dont think it could have came out any better.

Although my family said this recipe was very good.  I thought it was just OK, nothing exciting.  I didn't really like the way my butterscotch chips did not really melt but remained lumps of sugary hardness so I would have liked it better without them.  I did follow others instructions to decrease the sugar and am glad I did.

This is a fantastic recipe!  I used 8 old hotdogs buns and it turned out great!  The only changes I made were to use one cup of brown sugar instead of two, and since I didn't have any butterscotch chips, I substitute with cinnamon ones.  Then I added 1 t cinnamon and 1/2 t nutmeg.  It was wonderful warm, room temperature AND cold from the fridge.  I will definitely be making this again!

You can follow the directions exactly as written on this one and it turns out amazing... but if you do make some alterations, it still turns out great! I have made several times and everyone loves it! Very sweet, though, so if you don't have a sweet tooth, watch out.

This is wonderful tasting dish. I did try the original way before tweaking a bit.  I used PAM to spray the dish instead of butter. I used cinnamon raisin bread, cut the butter down to 1/4 cup (way too greasy otherwise), added a generous amount of nutmeg to mixture along with about 1/2 cup of raisins that I soaked overnight in dark rum.
Everyone that I served it to was impressed and there wasn't a crumb left to bring home with me.

This is a really fantastic recipe for bread pudding! I brought this to a function 2 nights ago & EVERYONE thought it was the best - one person stated that nothing has compared to her moms, but that this was even better. CHANGES MADE: doubled recipe, halved the amounts of butter and sugar, tossed bread in cinnamon to cover, used extra large eggs (and added one extra), baked in a water bath (bread pudding in a pan nestled in another pan with water in it.) Water bath allowed the pudding to stay moist without needing the extra butter or sugar.  GREAT RECIPE!!! Served with cool whip.

This is my go to dessert when I have company over.  I couldn't find butterscotch chips this Christmas, so I made it with chocolate milk and peanut butter chips, it was a great subsitute, everyone enjoyed eating it by the fireplace.  I have also made it without the chips and in replacement, topped it with a creme anglaise sauce, simple but delicious.  Love this dessert!

I was skeptical about this recipe but WOW! It was delicious, and a great way to use stale bread! I used a loaf of french bread that was stale and hard on the ends, and it came out beautifully! My boyfriend loves it and asked me to make it again for his birthday at the end of the month :)

The pudding tasted great, and my mom especially liked it. As another reviewer suggested, you can put nearly half the sugar the recipe calls for. I have already made it twice, and plan on making it again.

brilliant taste. really packs a punch. i give it 4 stars only because most people found it to be TOO sweet. will cut down on the brown sugar next time. 

NOTE> i poured boiling milk over cubed slices of white bread and then added the rest of the ingredients and let it sit about 15 miniutes before baking.

Great recipe! We make it any time we have extra bread in the house, and with making daily lunches, there's always plenty of that. Hubby took some extra slices to work and shared with a co-worker and he said it reminded him of something he got when he was home in El Salvador. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was outstanding. This is the best bread pudding i've ever made. The only change I made was using 2 cups of half and half and 2 cups of whole milky. It gave it a divine texture-very good caramel/butterscoth flavor. I served it with french vanilla ice cream and real whipped cream-YUM! I did need to cover it with foil the last 10 minutes so keep an eye on the top towards the end.

Kids all gone, so just the wife & I left.  Cut the recipe in half, and can't believe how easy it was to make.  Topped with a little vanilla ice cream, it was just superb. Highly recommended.

My mom asked for the recipe for this. She has never...in our lives...asked me for a recipe. Even better...know that this is a very forgiving recipe. I did it to use up some rolls I purchased and never used. Not sure how much of anything I actually used - just dumped it in, refrigerated it overnight and baked it. Perfection. Truly delicious.

1st time I had bread pudding was in a restaurant,  when I just moved to live in US, about 16 years ago. I loved it and thought it was a great way to use stale bread. Now, I make this dessert quite often and buy extra bread just to make it..
This recipe is one of my favorite bread pudding from this site.
I like that it has fewer eggs than other recipes, so you don't get that mushy, eggy bottom. I found that  the bread pudding was sweet enough with just 1 1/4 cup sugar. I had made it with different kind of bread with good result. I had made with butterscotch chips, few times and with chocolate toffee bits, other times. My family likes the toffee bits better.
Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I used what I had on hand, and like so many others adapted it to my preferences.  Used cuban bread I'd had in the fridge forever, half and half and millk, added another egg, reduced the brown sugar to 1 3/4 cups, and instead of the butterscotch chips I used 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips and a large handful of shredded coconut!  It was divine!  Again, husband loved it!

This was amazing! I made a few alterations. As some other users mentioned, I used cinnamon swirl bread. I also used half and half and whipping cream in equal parts to substitute for the milk. My family absolutely loved it.

Holy mother of God this is good. I used challah, 1.5 c dark brown sugar, and 2 c heavy cream in place of 2 c milk. I also added some cinnamon (just eyeballed it) and a pinch of salt. The butterscotch makes it simply amazing.

My problem with this recipe was the butterscotch chips. They had a yucky artificial taste. If there is a high quality chip available to you, I would suggest you purchase it. My store did not have any options.

I made the recipe as written with homemade white bread. It turned out lovely and was very good. Happy to find a bread pudding without raisins. Not to knock the recipe but because I am not used to anything quite so sweet so will only I will 1/2 the sugar next time.

We ALL love this bread pudding. So easy and reliable.  I've been using this recipe for several years and have slightly tweaked it, which is the only reason it doesn't rate 5 stars.  I add 1/2 C. walnuts and cut down the brown sugar to 1 cup.

I have never liked bread pudding before, but I absolutely love this recipe!!!  It has become a family favorite and I take it to many potlucks as it has become a requested dish. I don't make any changes to the original recipe, I think it is perfect the way it is.

I use brioche buns and reduce the sugar. Also you could use redcurrant jam as a glaze.

This recipe is fabulous!  I tried it because I had a lot of bread in the house and needed to find something to do with it.  My family is usually not too keen on bread pudding (they think it is mushy and eggy tasting) and this was neither one of those!  It was light and fluffy and had a fabulous butterscotch flavor.  This is the best recipe for bread pudding and the only one I will use from now on.  And, it is SO versatile!  I have made this with challah, Portuguese sweet bread rolls, and even hard homemade wheat bead - each time it came out delicious!  I think the key is to really crumble the bread up if you are using a rustic type of loaf (and be sure to trim the edges off).  I even mixed it up and put it in the fridge and baked it the next day and it came out wonderfully!  If you are on the fence, give it a try.  It is definitely worth it!

Cooking doesn't get simpler than this: combine and bake. Or more delicious than this.  A huge hit with all who tasted something they'd not had before.

Delicious!
As much as I hate it when people say..."I changed it"...I did. I only added ½ of the sugar because I thought it would just be too much & it turned out sweet & delicious!

Excellent bread pudding!!  I had just under a cup of brown sugar on hand, so I used 1 can  of condensed milk as part of the 4cups milk. Instead of butterscotch chips, I used cinnamon chips. YUM!!

This was ok. I was hoping that it would be a WOW type of bread pudding but it wasn't. My bread pudding was a bit soggy even though I left it more  than 1 hour in the oven (90minutes to be exact)  it was still mushy. Ill try another bread pudding recipe on this website hopefully I'll find one that's a definite WOW!

turned out wonderfully! gave it 4 stars as it was a bit sweet for my taste. cut the sugar to 1.5 cups per other comments. next time will cut back to 3/4-1 cup, and 3/4 c butterscotch chips.  might even try it with a whole-grain bread!

Made this with raisins because I didn't have the butterscotch chips and added some cinnamon. Other than those changes I followed the recipe, and it was one of the best bread puddings we have ever eaten!

I just got second place in a dessert competition with this recipe.  I cut the brown sugar back to 1 1/2 cups, and doubled the butterscotch chips.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to add fruit, like apples or raisins, as some other reviewers did, to add another dimension to the flavor.  And I topped mine with Rediwhip.

My grandson and i made this together~!! I made it with the raisen bread and only made half the recipe. It makes alot. I also did the traditional sauce to go with it but believe me it is just as good without it. Also, my bunch doesnt even like rasins but they LOVED this dish....so did my pastor. Thanks for a great recipe Margaret

Oh, my this is yummy!! Incredible warm right out of the oven, but I know it's going to be great cold too (if it lasts that long)! I did heed the advice of some and added a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon. I made this on a snowy day when my family was all home and snowed in....oh, baby! :)

This was the first time I've tried to make any kind of bread pudding. After ordering it at a restaurant, I figured I could save money by making it at home.  This recipe is fantastic! I followed it exactly and the only changes I made was using french bread broken apart into pieces because I didn't have day old bread.  I do suggest as others have said to make sure that it is oatmeal consistency.  I had to add more bread than the recipe called for.  But just eye it so that there is enough bread to sop up the liquid.    The taste was just as good if not BETTER than at the fancy restaurant.  It was great cold from the fridge the next day and even better heated up served with some vanilla ice cream.

I followed this recipe to the letter and it is Awesome... it was beautiful when I pulled it out of the oven and put directly into the warming drawer (mistake?) Puffy and golden, but it fell..I will experiment with this...but the flavor and all the raves from my family was wonderful...sooo simple and easy to make.  This is a keeper!!

I've made this twice for my coworkers, and it was a hit both times. The first time I added cinnamon and swapped out some maple syrup for one cup of the sugar . The second I cut the sugar back by 1/2 cup and added raspberries and chocolate chips. Decadent and delicious!

This recipe is amazing! One thing I tried was to use a 7 or 9 grain bread in place of the normal "day old" bread and it was so good! Gave it a texture variation from the seeds in the bread. Very, Very good!

AWESOME! Great base recipe, but I made some revisions: -Used cinnamon swirl bread, almost but not quite the whole loaf -Sliced in two bananas -Added about half cup more of butterscotch chips -Added in a cinnmon spice blend (cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, cardamon, etc) -Served with butterscotch and hot caramel drizzled over top and Haagen Dazs banana fosters ice cream on the side  TO DIE FOR!!! Like something from a restaurant. Thanks for the recipe!

I make this every Christmas Eve when my family comes over and it is so delicious.  I give it a 4/5 since sometimes I have a hard time getting that middle to firm up to "a jiggly thigh."

I'm a huge skeptic when it comes to bread pudding, but I had old bread to get rid of, so I tried it. I'm definitely keeping this recipe!

This recipe is absolutely fabulous!  I served it with a sauce so I cut back on the sugar by 1/2 cup.  I used cinnamon swirl bread as others suggested and added a bit of extra cinnamon.  Oh my gracious, absolutely out of this world!  Thank you for the recipe, its definitely a keeper!

YUM!!!  I made my boyfriend take the leftovers to work with him the next day for fear that I would eat it all myself.  I will definitely make this again and again!  P.S. I did cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 cups...my butterscotch chips seemed extra sweet.

This was just okay for me, but it may be just that I am not a bread pudding person. This was the first time I ever tried it, so I don't really know what it is "supposed" to taste like.

Awesome recipe and so simple to make. A little on the sweet side for my personal tastes but still very good. Never had or made bread pudding before but had some stale bread that needed to be used. Took it for a church function and received rave reviews. Don't normally rate recipes but this deserved 1. Thanks for recipe.

I scaled down this recipe to fit in an 8x8 dish and used 2 eggs, an 8 oz loaf of bread and then half the rest of the custard ingredients.  Oh, except I did keep the butterscotch chips at 1 cup :)  I also added 1 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice, which was a great addition.  This recipe is a great one to tweak to your own tastes, which I look forward to doing.  My 8x8 pudding cooked for 70 minutes.

So good!  I had a fresh loaf of bread, so I tore it up and threw it in the oven for a few minutes to dry out, but it was wonderful!  I prefer mine warm. but this is definitely something you can make the night before and whip out for breakfast.

All I can say is WOW, if I could give this 6 stars I would. As some other raters suggested, I substituted the milk for 2 cups whipping cream and 2 cups half and half. I also used cheap white bread, the kind that gets really soggy when you add it to the milk. If  you are looking for a totally out of this world, rich, decadent desert- look no further.

Ok, the first day I was not so sure...the longer it stays in the fridge the better it is.  I used a cinnamon swirl bread that worked well.  I also used half n half instead of plain milk.  I love butterscotch so this was yummy, but I think if a person could find cinnamon chips or perhaps even cut up caramels that would be much better.  Either way, it was easy and yummy.

We don't like butterscotch so I didn't use any bs chips. Only used 1 1/2 cup dark brown sugar(thats all I had). We also added chopped honeycrisp apples and golden raisins that we had sauted in the melted butter for a about 1 to 2 minutes. I could tell that this was going to be a great basic recipe for bread pudding. It would have also been good without the apples and raisins.

I had made two big loaves of italian bread and we couldn't eat them fast enough.  I didn't know what to do with the leftovers until I found this recipe.  It is AMAZING!  I halfed the recipe, but other than that I followed it exactly.  I have decided to make this recipe a family tradition, perfect for holiday breakfasts!

OMG scrumptious! Perfect as is! Will definitely be making this again, perhaps for Christmas I'll throw in some cinnamon and nutmeg for the Christmas feel. I used dinner rolls because I had a whole bag I bought from Costco, and now I know what I can do without having to waste them again! THANK YOU SO MUCH for this recipe. Best I've ever tasted, never again going to the bakery for bread pudding.

Excellent. My wife had never had bread pudding before and she loved this. I followed the advice of earlier raters and added golden raisins. I served it warm with a little half and half. This one stays in my recipe box.

Made exactly as written, but, next time I think I would add raisins and some spices like cinnamon as suggested by other reviewers.  This was really easy to put together & would be a great addition to a brunch buffet.  As written, it definately can use a dab of whip cream on top.

This was really good.  It was very easy to make.  I followed suggestions and just made a few changes: only used 1 cup of brown sugar; I had only 1/2 cup butterscotch chips on hand, so I mixed in an additional 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips;  I also used a loaf of a week old whole grain white bread and added cinnamon.  It was sooooo good!  Will definitely make again!

A super simple recipe to make amazing bread pudding, even if it's your first time! I used this recipe on Saturday to make bread pudding for the very first time and I got nothing but raves from everyone.  I followed previous suggestions to reduce the brown sugar to 1 c and substituted 2 c of milk with half and half.  Used a loaf of sourdough bread and it was delicious.  Will make again.

Delicious!! Remember to toast the bread before mixing with other ingredients. If you don't do this, you end up with soggy pudding.

Let me just start off by saying I do not like bread pudding. We ended up with an overload of french baguettes one day so I decided to make bread pudding. I stumbled across this recipe and thought I would try it. I am in love. This recipe made me change my mind about bread pudding. I have never had bread pudding that tastes so incredible before. We will definitely be making this again, as I now love bread pudding.

AMAZING.  I made this for Easter Brunch, with RAVE reviews from my family.  I followed recipe exactly as stated, but I did cut brown sugar back by 1/2 cup.  Leftovers scrumptious - warm or cold.  Wow!

I generally do not eat breadpudding but had to stop myself overeating this one. I had to stop my husband after his third serving! This speaks for itself (and the bread pudding.)

This was ok. I have made bread puddings before that were nothing fantastic and I thought that maybe the added butterscotch chips would help but it was still just ok.

Wow, what a great recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly.  I had taken out some raisins to add to it, but ended up forgetting to put them in.  Next time I'll definitely add those, since I love them in bread pudding.  I might also try making a sauce to put over it, just to see if it can make an excellent recipe even better!

I am a huge fan of bread pudding. I've made several and always enjoy them, but this one is by far a family and friend favorite. It is soooo simple to make and everyone loves it. It reheats well too. One recipes fills two 8" x 8" pans - so one for family and one for friends!

Simply the best! I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, used 1/2 tsp more of vanilla and substituted half of the butterscotch with white chocolate. Divine.

Made a few times and each time was begged for the recipe! Used suggestion of 2 C of heavy cream and 2 C of half and half with added white chocolate chips with equal success! Both ways are great! Someone commented that this has the smoothest taste with a surprise pop in every mouthful! This is a keeper, and it is great for a crowd as feeds so many!

I have tried many kinds of bread pudding, but this is the easiest one and has a top notch taste. I melted the butter with the brown sugar and vanilla with milks (substituting half n half and 2%). I reduced sugar to 1 cup brown but with the butterscotch chips it was perfection. Touch of vanilla ice cream on top while hot and a cup of tea - bliss!

OK, I have to add my voice to the multitude that are already on here. I LOVE this recipe and I don't normally like bread pudding. I could tell by reading the recipe that this would be one that I would like and I wasn't disappointed at all. I followed the recipe exactly and I will be making this recipe frequently!  It is awesome!  Thanks for submitting it!

Very tasty and a nice change from the raisin bread pudding. Like other reviewers, I did reduce the sugar by half - it is plenty sweet with the butterscotch chips involved.

OMG!! So yummy!  I added cinnamon and doubled the butterscotch chips thinking I was gonna be slick and have more butterscotch flavor. Ha! Wont do that again.  My chips never fully melted so I had this butterscotch sauce flowing through my pudding next time I will stick to 1 cup.  I will so make this again!

WOW... this was fantastic.  The only change I made was to use about 3/4 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips.  I wish I could give it six stars.

I loved this recipe, but had to make a few changes. I substituted soy milk for regular milk and used a loaf (16 oz) of cinnamin-raisin bread instead of white bread. I also added 1 cup of shredded coconut and sprinkled chopped pecans on top before putting it in the oven.
Delicious and not overly sweet!

I made this bread pudding the past weekend. I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but it still turned out well, and all credit goes to Maragret Burger. 
I used cinnamon raisin bread, and a few pieces of some oatmeal bread that I had lying around. 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon pwd. and can of evaporated milk in addition to milk to equal 4 cups. I didn't pack the brown sugar, and I used a 11x7 instead of a 9x13 and cooked it for about 65 mins. IT WAS PERFECT! 
Absolutely wonderful bread pudding, the butterscotch wasn't overpowering at all, nor the vanilla. I buttered up the dish well, then used a quick spray of pam just to make sure, The pudding came out clean, no sticking. I think that it tasted even better the next day. The longer it sat around the tastier it was. I think I'd like to make this for company. Maybe make it the night before and warm it the next day. Terrific Bread Pudding. Kudos.

I used 2 day old bakery cinnamon raisin bread to make this. Not only was this delish but it was also great recipe to make with the kids. My 3 year old and my 4 year old loved helping tear up the bread and mix everything. This is definately a keeper !

This was good. After I started making it I realized that I didnt have as much butterscotch chips as I thought so I put in some chocolate chips to make up for it. I did cut the sugar by half, which I think would be good if I used all butterscotch chips, but since I didnt I think I couldve used more sugar. It was really good though. We had it with ice cream. I just finished eating some cold too and it was yummy.

This is a GREAT recipe. It is soooo delicious! I used up all the leftover bread in my freezer (misc. hamburger and hot dog buns, heels of bread, etc.) and this recipe still turned out awesome. I only used 1 cup of sugar and it was still a little sweet for our taste (I cannot imagine how sweet it would be with 2 cups!) This recipe is worth trying.

I have made this twice and it has turned out great both times. The second time, I had run out of vanilla and used maple syrup instead. I have also tried it white and wheat bread and it was great both ways.

I give this four stars just because I think a whole stick of butter is way too much and it left a puddle of grease on top.  I cut sugar back to 1 1/2 cups and added in a tsp or so of cinnamon for taste preference.  I also threw in the whole bag of butterscotch chips just so I didn't have half a bag hanging around.  Great flavor and taste but I thing next time I will add half the butter and it would be a five star treat.  
I served warm with vanilla ice cream on top.  YUM!

This was so delicious.  I used old hamburger rolls that were 11 oz.  I tore them very small.  I followed the recipe as shown, but then added raisins soaked in rum.  Very Good!

Everyone in my family was skeptical because we've never had good bread pudding, but I had a bunch of leftover whole wheat crusts from a party, so I tried it.  I used milk chocolate chips because I didn't have butterscotch on hand.  Served a la mode, vanilla.  Sooo good!  Everyone admitted it was super good after all.

This tasted awesome and my guests and family agreed!  I was a little disapointed by how greasy/oily it got on the top towards the end of baking it.  It made the butterscotch chips a weird consistancy and it did not look very pretty.  Maybe I would bake it longer next time.  Once we all got over that stuff we loved it!

So easy, so good! Used a crusty Italian bread, cut into chunks, and put it into the pan. I mixed all the other ingredients together and then poured over the bread. I let it sit for about 30 minutes and then baked it. I went ahead and used the whole bag of chips and added rum soaked raisins. I used 2% milk and it still tasted really rich. I didn't have icecream on hand so I made a white chocolate brandy sauce to pour over (recipe on this site with the white chocolate cheesecake). It was absolutely delicious, but I think I liked it even better straight out of the fridge the next day.

I had my doubts about this because I don't like butterscotch chips, but we had some in the house, so I thought, what the heck!  Wow!  It was REALLY good.  The chips melted nicely into the bread.  I made ours with homemade bread (Amish White Bread) and broiled it for a minute or so to get it crispy on top and it was outstanding.  We didn't have whipping cream or ice cream to top it, but I couldn't get enough even with a glass of milk.  Quick and easy too.  Will definitely be having this for dessert again.  (I did halve the recipe, though, and it was plenty for us and the three kids (used 2 eggs).

My family said this was "the best bread pudding they ever ate" at our Labor Day dinner!  This recipe was so easy and delicious.  I did use cinnamon raisin bread and topped with homemade whipped cream, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I have a feeling I will be making this a lot as the cooler months approach!! Great recipe!

I thought it was great. I used "texas toast" style bread. I didn't use the whole loaf (because my loaf had more weight than the recipe called for) but I should have. Next time I'll use the whole loaf minus the end pieces. Good stuff!

OMG! This is such a fool proof recipe let me tell ya! I made it in an 8in. square pan. Obviously, used less of everything, but didn't measure anything at all! I cubed some italian bread and placed in the pan to fill it up. I then mixed all the other ingredients in a bowl and poured over the bread. I used about 1cup demerrera sugar instead of golden brown sugar. About 1/4 cup of butter that I forgot to melt! I also used 2 eggs instead of 3. Poured the milk freely estimating how much I would need to barely cover the bread. and about 1c butterscotch chips.baked for abt 30 mins. Let me tell you, it was just the most easy fast and delicious bread pudding ever! My husband who is usually very critical, couldn't stop saying how good it was and almost finished the whole thing on his own! He said it was even better than the bread pudding at Mandarin Restaurant(buffet)!!!

used a day old (hard) bagguette, put the bite size bread pieces in the pan, sprikled the chips over the bread, then poured the remaining ingredients mixure over the bread.  I let the mixture sit for 1/2 hour to let the bread really soak up the wet stuff.  It seemed really giggly when it first came out, but it thickened up and was delicious!

ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTFUL! My hubby and company loved it right out of the oven with vanilla ice cream. I used 2 c. milk & 2 c. water and a whole bag of butterscotch chips. I also put it in for an extra 10 minutes so make it crispier on top.

This is AMAZING - even my kids loved it!  It makes a great potluck dish . . . quick, yummy and a hit with the family and office.  As a little extra sweetness, I used some old cinnamon rolls as well as regular french bread.

This was awesome! I made it for Thanksgiving, and it was declared the best bread pudding anyone had ever had! I used good sweet French bread from a bakery, which might have made a difference, I don't know. I've been asked to make it again for Christmas!

This is the most luscious bread pudding I've ever made. The butterscotch flavor really puts it over the top.  I'm embarrassed to say I ate the entire bowlful singlehandedly. I did have to bake it about 15 minutes longer than the recipe stated.  Worth the wait.

This is my “go to” dessert when I have company and every time it’s the biggest hit. Everyone begs for the recipe. It’s so simple and easy to make that you wouldn’t think it would be anything special but it’s amazing. I’ve tried other bread pudding recipes and they just don’t measure up. I use simple white bread, tear it into pieces and leave it out to stale it the night before so it doesn’t get too soggy and the texture holds up well. But from what it sounds like, you can use many different types of breads and it all turns out great!

Excellent recipe. Although it is kind of sweet.  If you would like to make a sauce for the bread pudding, I suggest you reduce the sugar. Otherwise, this is excellent, even if you would like to add some pecans or  cinnamon /nutmeg.

This recipe was great. Made almost exactly as written with the exception of using cinnamon raisin bread and white chocolate chips as I could find no butterscotch chips. The masses raved.

DEELISH! Only changes I made were to use one loaf French bread, one tablespoon cinnamon, and an extra egg. I also used half Ghiradelli caramel chips, half Nestle butterscotch chips. Cooking time for me was 1 hr 20 min. I let cool a bit and then served with Vanilla ice cream, sprinkle of cinnamon, and a little drizzle of Ghiradelli caramel sauce. Soo good and rich!

felt like I needed to saturate the bread more than the recipe called for. also that I may not have had enough milk egg mixture.

A few bits on top were toasted and besides choking on a random toast flake it was tasty.

I have made this - no kidding - at least a dozen times and what a hit it is!!  My guest almost lick their plates :) 

Be sure to serve it with the Creme Anglaise II sauce from this site - it elevates it to an entirely new level!!  

One note, I prefer a less "egg-y" bread pudding.  I usually use about 13-14 cups of cubed bread.  I save left over rolls, hamburger/hotdog buns, etc. and throw them in my freezer.  Potato rolls work amazingly well.   When I have saved enough, I cube the bread and dry it either overnight or by baking it in 250 degree oven for about 30 minutes.  

I try to keep the bread cubes whole when I mix the bread and egg mixture.  I think it gives it a bit of character and texture.  I also save about 1/3 of the butterscotch chips to sprinkle on the top.

I thought this would be good made in a crock pot. Some of the reviews recommended this method. I did not like it in the crock pot at all! Cooked it on high for 2 -3 hours, it was still gooey in the center. I might make it again but definitely not in my crockpot. The taste was okay, just too soggy for me.

Having NEVER eating any form of bread pudding before, I was excited to try it - I made it for company last evening and everyone said it was the best dessert they ever had and I wouldn’t disagree! The only change I made was (at the suggestion of others) I used 2.5cups half & half and 1.5cups of whipping cream. I also used a bit more butterscotch chips. I served it with fresher whipped cream that I flavored with Mexican vanilla bean. This recipe was TO DIE FOR and I think will be my go to from now on!

1) Great recipe, maybe just a tad less sugar.

2) Tried using Challah Bread one time and it came out amazing. 

3) Also used gluten free hamburger buns for a family member with gluten issues, came out just as delicious.

I thought this was a bit sweet but my wife (who loves bread pudding) said it was the best she’s ever tasted!  She’s only found one restaurant that can make an adequate one but this rivals it.  I read the note about tin foil but I guess not close enough... anyway I covered it and since I don’t like mine soggy, first checked it after 1hour.  Then uncovered it thinking I was going to regret covering it at all and cooked another 20 min.  Cover or no, I think this definitely will need more cooking time than it says, it turned out perfect either right out of the oven or 3 hours later when we went back for more. WINNER!!!

Oh my. SOOO good. I could've eaten the whole pan myself. I didn't have stale bread, so I cut it up in cubes and baked it for a few minutes to firm it up. Turned out great!!

Easy to make and tasted awesome. I needed to get ready of old and expired milk (Not Sour) and hot dog buns (No mold, getting stale. I used chocolate chips instead of butterscotch chips. I hate wasting food and throwing it out. I used Cristco in the pan and the pudding did not stick.

My mother, sister and I were always on the search for the best bread pudding. - so I have made a lot of different bread pudding using different recipes!  I started using this one a few years back - and it is now my "go-to" bread pudding for potlucks and events.  Everyone loves it!

Fabulous recipe! I was looking for a recipe to use up some 2 day old homemade donuts (I really didn’t want to throw those out!) but I didn’t have any buttersccotch chips. Noticing from other reviews how versatile this recipe was, I decided to try it. I used 1 medium apple chopped fine instead of butterscotch chips and sprinkled the batter with cinnamon after I poured it into the pan.  Worried that it might not have enough flavour or sweetness I decided to make a brandy sauce, just in case. (For that I used  1/2 cup of butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup heavy cream and 1/3 cup brandy - melt over low-med heat til bubbly at the edges.) I needn’t  have worried - the sauce is very nice but the pudding is fabulous with or without it.  My husband and son RAVED about this dessert. Definitely keeping this recipe!

This was my first attempt at bread pudding. This recipe had me at butterscotch. I used a combo of cinnamon and potato bread. I used about 1.5 cups of brown sugar but I agree with other reviewers it was really sweet (maybe because I subbed cinnamon bread). Husband liked it a lot as is though. Next time I would probably use less sugar. Also I cooked it quite a bit longer because it was really jiggly. Next time I may cook it even more because I don’t like mushy bread pudding. Will try it cold tomorrow and see if that makes a big difference. Would make again. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is an amazing recipe.  I took the advice of other reviews and added brandy-soaked raisons and cinnamon bread with cinnamon chips instead of butterscotch chips.  It was unreal.  I make it for pot lucks and everyone always wants the recipe.

Amazing! I used skim milk and added a package of the new salted caramel chips which gave it that extra hit of flavour.

This was a super easy recipe!  Went together easily.  I took it to a potluck and it was gone before I knew it.  I served it with vanilla bean ice cream.  I didn’t make any changes to the original recipe.

Made this for a family reunion and everyone loved it. Didn't change a thing. I actually doubled the recipe and put it in the 9x13 pan. It took about an hour an a half...During the cooking process it came close to rising over the top of the pan. When taken out of the oven it settled a bit. Will totally be making this again

DON'T LET LEFTOVER HOT DOG BUNS GO TO WASTE!! Yes, you read that right. We had a lot of hot dog buns leftover from a recent camping trip & I thought why not try making a bread pudding? Worked out perfect! I didn't change a thing either. Try it!

The basic recipe was great, I substituted the butterscotch chips for chopped  dates and almond slivers equaling  1 cup, the milk to cups whole milk and one cup half and half.    The baking time is 1 hr. and 30 minutes.  The pudding was moist and crunchy from not only the outer crust but also the almonds added.  It is very sweet, so if you don't want it so sweet cut down on the brown sugar.

Turned out awesome!  Whole family loved it.  Had semi-sweet chocolate chips so used those but am really excited to try with butterscotch.

I LOVE this recipe!  Soaking the raisons in bourbon or apple juice is a great recommendation.  I use cinnamon chips instead of butterscotch which gives the dish a whole new amazing flavor.  I also add chopped pecans.  Love it!  Super easy for a dish to pass party

This was AWESOME! Soo good! Definitely needs to be eaten with vanilla ice cream though cause it's really sweet. But man it's worth it.

This was fantastic! The only thing i changed was using a loaf of raisin bread instead of regular bread.

Delicious. I think it was either too much bread or too much milk but, like another reviewer said, I had to cook it for almost 1-1/2 hours. I could've taken it out at 1 hour but I don't like jiggly bread pudding.  It turned out with a nice crusty edge. Thank you for the great recipe.

Awesome recipe, I had never made any type of bread pudding so it was truly a learning experience.  I took this to work and it was gone within an hour.  I did use the entire bag of butterscotch chips instead of just one cup and then I used 2 cups of half and half and 2 cups milk.  It was exceptional!

I used 3/4 loaf of stale challah bread. Then let it set in the fridge for 30 min. It helped the bread really absorb the custard.

This is a great recipe! This is replacing my current bread pudding recipe. I used some honey wheat bread that I had baked a couple days prior.It was still pretty fresh so I cubed it and toasted it in the oven for a few mins. Didn't have butterscotch chips so I used a granny smith apple and two teaspoons of cinnamon and baked it in a waterbath for an hour and it was perfect!I made a whiskey sauce from another recipe on this site to serve with it. My husband is a huge bread pudding fan and he loved this too! The whole tray was gone in two days and it was just the two of us! Thank you for my new favorite bread pudding recipe!!!

I followed this recipe exactly as is...it smelled amazing but it was WAY to moist. I would also recommend using a smaller size pan (when I think of bread pudding I think more loaf size)

I used substantially less sugar.  Since I couldn't find butterscotch pieces, I used two large Cadbury chocolate and caramel bars and broke them into pieces.  It was AWESOME!!  Incidentally, it took more like 40-45 minutes to bake.

I've never made bread pudding before but NOW I'm making it every week! The family LOVED this. I used dried bread strips I bought from Jewel. This made it very easy to just tear off little pieces while it's cooling, just so you know. ;)

What did I do wrong? I used wonderful ciabatta bread. I read the reviews about the quantity of sugar and chips so I halved them. 
The bottom of the pan was wet and bread mushy. The top of the pan was crusted bread. And the chips just sank into the wet mush. Not the least bit appealing to look at. However, the taste was delightful. Was it the type of bread? Should I have sprinkled the chips on the top? Should the pan be covered with foil while baking? I did cook it for longer than the one hour because it was so soggy.

I love bread pudding and order it whenever it is on the menu.  This was good, but only good, not great.  I will say the flavor improves on day 3. The first problem I have is that butterscotch chips taste very artificial, I was hoping it would not be noticeable when mixed in but I was wrong.  I followed the advice of so many others and reduced the sugar, bad move.  I used 1.5 cups and it was not really sweet enough, but I am from the south and we like things sweet.  I baked in two smaller pans and it baked in about 50 min.  For the sauce I used my mom's standby of evap milk, sugar, and vanilla, with just a pinch of corn starch.  On day one without the sauce I would have given it 2 stars, on day 3 and with adding sauce it is a 3.5.  I am still searching for the 5 star bread pudding recipe.   I will try it again with the full 2 cups of sugar and sub in choc chips.

Great recipe. I only used 1/4 cup of butterscotch chips because I didn't want it too sweet. Even so,  may reduce the brown sugar by 1/4 cup and eliminate the butterscotch chips altogether. I used a tin of evaporated milk (2 cups) and then 2 cups of whole milk. The consistency was great. I divided the mixture in half and baked in 8 in square pans. I only baked one for about 30 minutes and the other for 45 minutes. I actually preferred the one baked for 30 mins because it was moister but my son liked the one baked longer. Either way, this is a great recipe and is now my go-to recipe for bread pudding.

This was super easy to make.  I made a few substitutions -- I used pumpkin loaf bread and dark chocolate chips.  I also cut the brown sugar in half.  The kids loved it and I'm planning to make this again for the office holiday potluck.

Really good! Glad I tried this one. I cut sugar down to one cup, otherwise followed recipe exactly.  I used skim milk because it was all I had, but I will try it with whole milk next time or possibly half and half.

This was delicious!  Rave reviews.  Definitely not too sweet.  I used 1.5 loaves of homemade italian bread.  Followed the recipe.  Also used whole milk - that probably makes a difference in how much sugar taste comes through.

great taste - one of the best i've tried so far.  i used pepperridge farm cinnamon bread.  i didnt use the whole loaf cos it was 16 oz., but when i got all the ingredients mixed together, it was alot of liquid (not oatmeal consistency).  so i added about 4 more slices of regular bread.  i thought for sure it wouldnt turn out, but i cooked it (with foil on top) for 1 hr. 45 min. and it did turn out fine.  next time if i use that same sweet bread, i'll reduce the butter by half and the brown sugar by 1/2 cup (or even 3/4 c.).   i originally reduced it by 1/4 cup, but it could definitely go down more.  it was very sweet and would be great served warm with vanilla ice cream!

Was not impressed at all.  It had a good flavor even if it was very rich.  I baked it for 90 min and it still came out soggy.  I think if I try it again I will cut the sugar back by 1/4 or 1/2 cup and maybe cut the milk back too.

Wow, really good. I'm not a huge fan of bread pudding but I made this for my husband and I love it. I did use half heavy cream because I had some I wanted to use and I also used frozen waffles instead of bread. Wonderful!

Very good and easy to make!  I had the ingrediants on hand.  I should have cooked it a little longer though!  I wish I had a cream souce or some sort of caramel to go on top of it.

Made this for a friend who is a bread pudding fanatic. He asked for the recipe - high praise! I put 12 whole oversized maraschino cherries (bar style) in for a delicious treat.  They could easily be picked out by people who don't like them.

I don't even like bread pudding and I LOVED this. I did use 2 cups of half and half and 2 cups of milk. This recipe is delicious and got rave reviews. I also cut the amount of brown sugar to about half, its very rich with even 1 1/2 cups.

I followed it to the tee, but a little too sweet for me.  If I make it again, I think I would use less brown sugar and/or maybe even a little less butterscotch chips.

Much too sweet for my taste, but the recipe shows promise.  I added dried cranberries and used white chocolate chips instead of butterscotch.  Next time I will try it with only 1 c. sugar and 1/4 c. butter.  My family liked it served with giant dollops of whipped cream, and I think it would be good served warm with vanilla ice cream.  We'll try that next time, too.

I think this is a little too sweet as written but still a great base recipe - very flexible.  I made it once as written, and then last night I used 1 c of brown sugar, some chocolate milk (just used a little choc syrup in regular milk - not too much), and combined butterscotch chips with mini chocolate chips.  I also sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar both times.  WOW, really good.

Is it supposed to taste like that? I don't know why people liked this recipe... the only thing that saved it was that I threw in raisins, thank heavens.

I made this for Thanksgiving using cinnamon bread and half and half and added pecans also. It seemed a little too moist after baking  for the time specificed.  I baked it for again 35-40 min and it was alot better.  I loved the flavor of the cinnamon bread and the butterscotch together.  My family wasnt real crazy about this receipe but I enjoyed it. I think bread pudding is an aquired taste it your not used to it.  Thanks for the receipe.

It was as good as everyone said it was.  I hated to leave the uneaten portion at our host's home when we left, but it would have been too tacky to reclaim it.  I probably added more butterscotch morsels than it called for (entire 12 oz. bag), and I used light brown sugar and sprinkled top with pecans.  Fabulous!

This was my first attempt at bread pudding.  I used a loaf of cinnamon swirl bread with raisins and substituted chocolate chips for the butterscotch ones.  Then I cooked the heck out of it; nearly twice as long as suggested.  The pudding came out wonderfully and tasted great!

A good way to balance the sweetness of this recipie is to top with a unsweetened or lightly sweetened whipped cream.  For a fruity option, use a can of drained fruit cocktail in place of the butterscotch chips.

This recipe was marvelous! I edited it a bit though, because I didn't have some ingredients. I used white sugar instead of brown sugar, and I added peanut butter instead of butterscotch(I know, weird,right?) It turned out wonderful anyway!

This. Was. So. Good. Very sweet, I may cut some sugar out next time.  I added raisins soaked in rum and a simple rum sauce.  This is my go-to bread pudding recipe from now on.

Simply delicious.  My husband's favourite compared to other recipes I have tried from this site.  It was a little too sweet for me, I reduced the sugar to 1.5 cups and took some butterscotch amount out.

Really great.  I love the brown sugar. It gives it a carmel taste. I really don't like butterscotch, but I used chocolate and it was great.  I actually made it without the chocolate and it was still really good, but I do perfer the chocolate in it.

Holy cow!! I am a bread pudding SNOB and this takes the cake! (or pudding if you will) Yes, it is on the sweet side but it is awesome. I made it with one less cup milk (actually I used 2 cups 1% and 1 cup half and half) and it was a little firmer. Added a half tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg and substituted choco chips for butterscotch and it turned out fantastic. Topped it with a rum sauce recipe from this site and WOW! Thank you for sharing!!  Can't wait to make it for more then just my husband and I.

The first time I made this bread I used day old challah. It was the best desert I've ever made! My husband and our co-worker ate it hot out of the oven. it was so delicious we couldn't speak. I've since made it with other kinds of bread, but none of them have turned out as good as the first batch. Definitely use a dense egg bread if you can. Cinnamon chips work great too.

My friends loved this bread pudding!  They all claimed it was the best bread pudding they ever had.  The only thing I did differently was add half chocolate chips w/the butterscotch and top it with rum sauce.

Excellent - I used half sweetened condensed milk and regular milk.  I also added some raisins I had and used a bit less brown sugar since I used sweet milk.

We really enjoyed this bread pudding. I didn't have a whole loaf of bread but the recipe was easy to cut in half. (I used two eggs). The butterscotch chips made it special. I think the sugar could be cut down because it was very sweet.

I never thought bread pudding sounded good, but I had stale bread, and thought I would give it a shot. I'm so glad I did! It was so tasty. I used white sugar instead of brown sugar, and white chips instead of butterscotch.

Really yummy. Everyone who tried it claimed it was the best bread budding they had ever had. I used half butterscotch and half white chocolate chips. I also used half Panettone bread that was left over from Christmas. I extended the bake time by 1/2 hour at least.

Wow!  This was a hit.  A half recipe fits perfectly in a pie pan.  It's rich enough that you could serve up to 5-6 with a half recipe, though I much prefer leftovers!

Loved the thigh wiggle comment, recipe was OK. It is hard to make bread pudding better than it already is. I was looking for caramel bread pudding like I had at a restuarant once and this wasn't it.

Excellent however I found this to be a little too sweet when made as written.  I will definately reduce the sugar next time.  Additionally I will use less butterscotch chips.  I too baked this about 20 minutes longer than the recipe called for as I don't like a "wet" consistency to my bread pudding.  I will certainly make this again.  My husband loved it!

I made this for a holiday event and it was the hit of the party. I brought the leftovers to a party the next day and re-heated it in the oven. All guests raved about it and thought it was the best bread pudding they'd ever had. I served whipped cream with it--something the dish would be "missing" without it.

My husband said he wanted a bread pudding for Christmas dessert, so I gave this one a try. I made it exactly as directed and we thought it was so good with a little freshly whipped cream. I wish the recipe divided more easily as it was too much for our small family. I didn't care for it cold - the taste was alright but the texture I thought was not that pleasant. Overall though I give it 5 stars because it was so wonderful and full of gooey bubbly goodness fresh from the oven. The smell was out of this world too.

I used a loaf of sourdough bread I needed to use up and took this to a church potluck.  It was very good! Next time I will make a sauce to put on top for a little extra WOW though.

I have never had bread pudding before because I don't care for raisins and I thought all bread puddings contained raisins!  I saw this recipe and was excited to try it!  It was a hit with both families that I made it for over Christmas.  Followed directions exactly and wouldn't change a thing!  YUMMY!  Super easy too!  Will definitely make it again and again.

I made this for Christmas dinner, and it was a hit. It tastes great warm or cold, and is nice with whipped cream. I did add some cinnamon, but it would be just as great without. Will definitely make again.

I really like bread pudding when it's still a little warm and this recipe was no exception. The butterscotch flavoring was really good and I did add a little cinnanmon. It will be a favorite in the dessert selection. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is wonderful! Here no such things as butterscotch chips are available, but I still gave this recipe a try with raisins instead and a drop of marsala liquor. The result was superb!It vanished in 1 hour! A keeper!

Maybe a little too sweet for me. After cooling I cut into squares and froze half the recipe for later. Warm in microwave and serve with cream.

This bread pudding was SOOOO good!!! I've made it 3 times now and I finally think I got it right. I used a 16oz day old crusty french baguette and kept the rest of the ingredients the same. The key to my perfect pudding was baking it on the TOP rack of my oven for 70 minutes. It was golden brown on top and not burned on the bottom (like my previous puddings were) We all eat this for breakfast and dessert, and boy does it go quick!

This was a great recipe. I made it for Christmas morning. I baked it the night before and reheated it in a low oven Christmas morning. I made the Sauce Anglaise recipe from this site to go with it, and it was A COMPLETE HIT. Everyone loved it, and my brother's skinny vegetarian g/f had four helpings. 

I did change the amount of sugar down to about a cup (not packed), and I don't like butterscotch, so I used semisweet chocolate chips instead and my measurements were probably a little off since I used a whole loaf of french bread, but I kept it at the "oatmeal-like" consistency, and cooked it for about an hour and a half. It was fantastic.

Made this for Christmas this year and wow was it ever good,  I used egg bread and will make this again for sure.  I didn't have to bake it for as long as the recipe asked for but that could be cause I had me oven on convection, am not sure exactly how long it baked for but when I looked it was already done and it was maybe half and hour

This recipe is very good but it's very  rich.  I followed the advice of the other reviews and did cut the sugar in half.  I am so glad I did because if I added anymore sugar it would've been too sweet. I also added nutmeg & cinnamon.

This is easy and perfect for parties. I made it for my sister and brother-in-law and they ate it for three days and I took the rest into work. It maintained it's moistness the entire time.
I did cut the sugar in half.
People just raved over this.

I made this for my Dad as a personal treat for Thanksgiving.  It was good, but a little too sweet for me.  I think next time I'll cut back on the sugar a bit and watch the oven a little more closely.  I used a smaller pan because my family likes their bread pudding in thick slices.  I thought it would need more time in the smaller pan, but instead it ended up getting burnt around the edges by 1 hour.

This is very good and very easy to make. We were craving bread pudding and just bought a loaf of sliced butter bread. It was just fine.. I am going to make it again but instead try it with french bread .. I think it won't be as mushy that way.

This recipe is awesome! I am an amateur cook and had the guts to make this for an employee Thanksgiving dinner. It was excellent and many people asked me for the recipe.. I also decreased the amount of milk to about two cups and decreased the amount of butter.

This was sooo good.  When I made it though, I couldn't get butterscotch chips so I substituted butterscotch macaroon chocolates.  I also added about 1/2 cup golden raisin soaked in rum.  It was one of the best deserts I have ever made!!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was the recipe that caused me to become an allrecipes.com registered user. I have tried dozens of recipes from this site, almost all have been wonderful. This however was amazing! I did reduce the b.sugar to 1 1/2 & it was just right. Very rich and yummy. Can't wait to make again.

Used less brown sugar than was called for.. butterscotch chips sweet enough.  Came out perfect!  Used SMALL loaf of french bread, torn to bits.  Used 3 eggs, less milk to compensate for less bread.  Vanilla and butter.. PERFECT.. kids eating for breakfast *what kind of mother am I??* and going.. mmmmmmmmmmm sooo good!

This recipe was simply awesome. The only problem was that it made WAY too much for just my fiancee and myself, so he ended up taking some to share at work and we gave some to the neighbors. Everyone and anyone that had a taste LOVED it!I must add that it tasted better on day 2 & 3 than it did on 1. Next time I will add white chocolate chips in place of the butterscotch. I can't wait to take this one to all holiday gatherings this year!

Really great!  My 5 & 7 year-old boys inhaled it!  Great with butter pecan ice cream.  I did use 1 3/4 cup brown sugar, will use 1/4 cup less next time.  Used 1 cup half & half and 1 cup 2% milk.

Excellent! Great flavor all by itself! Warm or cold, this is yummy! Super easy to prepare and smells divine!!! I think the butterscotch chips really add a great subtle flavor and are a must...I also added golden raisins which plumped up fabulously! YUM :)

This was soooooo good!  I used 3 or four different kinds of bread, all of which was almost finished, so I don't know exactly how much bread I used.  But, it came out great!  I tried to replicate it, this time "as instructed", and it still was a HUGE hit... the first dish finished (even before the entrees)!  So, my extra 5-pounds and I have to give this indulgent recipe 5-stars!

This bread pudding is amazing (if your on a diet and wanting to splurge, this is worth it!). I used cinnamon raisin bread and butterscotch chips... divine! I'd loooove to try cinnamon bread with cinnamon chips! The only thing I'll do different next time is cut back on the sugar... maybe by even a half a cup (it was a little too sweet for us!)

Good, but a little sweet.  This after using 1/2 the sugar.  Still, I knew it would be bc of the butterscotch chips, which is why I halved the sugar.  I also used half of a loaf of the apple raisin bread from this site, and it worked perfectly.  Thanks.

really good, especially because i've never made or eaten bread pudding before, so i had no idea what to expect. 

i found the recipe way too sweet when the pudding was hot, but as i took it out of the fridge after a night (it set wonderfully) it was not at all too sweet - so maby, if you're planning to eat it warm, you should try halfing the amount of sugar.

i altered the recipe as a consequence of a completely empty fridge - i used raisins, cinnamon, nutmeg, chopped chocolate and almonds. due to lack of sugar i replaced some of it with honey, but the sugar level was still kept in proportion to the recipe.

will make again, since my boyfriend ate 4 portions and counting..

Made this for a son that loves butterscotch waffles.  I used 1 cup of Splenda/brown sugar blend, a couple of shakes of cinnamon, 1/2 cup raisins soaked in hot water and 3/4 loaf of Italian bread.  It was wonderful straight out of the oven, and even better after cooling off.  We put away a little in the fridge, but I'm sure it will be gone by tonight! Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is the "bomb" as my kids would say. I get asked to make it all the time now. I make few changes as it is awesome the way it is. I actually use all the butter as called for. I substitute flavored creamer for some of the milk and if I have a little too much bread in the mix and things seem dry when it comes out of the oven my daughters like to put maple syrup on top.

This is really good, I actually used 3 different kinds of bread (odds and ends of bread that was in my freezer) and it turned out delicious.  I added raisins soaked in rum.  I think next time I will use less butter, it seemed like I could have gotten away with using less.

I made this, my first bread puding ever, and see no reason to try other recipes. Given the other reviews I cut the sugar back to 1 1/2 cups and used butterscotch chips and skor bits. I also added raisins and a bit of my secret cinammon spice mix. It came out fabulously!! I am letting it cool and then taking it over to my grandmothers as she loves bread pudding!!

I had to make a few changed to this recipe because I have an egg allergy in the family, but it turned out GREAT!! I spent a while looking for a good egg free bread pudding recipe because I had bread and milk to use up, but couldn't find anything. I made the recipe exactly as directed, but substituted bananas for the eggs and only used 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar. It was sweet, moist and PERFECT!!

Very good.  I changed the recipe somewhat due to my husband's wishes and what I happened to have on hand.  Used raisins instead of the butterscotch chips, added vanilla extract, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  Used 1/2 cup less sugar and used wheat sandwich bread instead.  The liquids were too much for the type of bread I used (I suppose).  The amount of bread called for in the recipe is roughly 1/2 a standard loaf of sandwich bread (10 slices).  I added 5 more slices to the mix to compensate for how much liquid there was, and that did the trick.  It was still a little runny, but I poured some of the liquid out, as my greased 9" cake pan would have run over.  I only baked it for 45 minutes, but it looked the right consistency.  Tastes like I'd expect a good bread pudding to taste, and not too sweet, either (since I skimped on the sugar).  Made this way, it would go well with a sauce drizzled on top.

I prepared this recipe pretty much as directed except without quite as much sugar and a tad less butter.  It came out perfectly and it was certainly good....but in my opinion it seemed to be missing something.  I would have preferred it more moist (I'm sure I didn't over-cook it) and with a stronger flavor.  Next time I'll either use less bread or more milk/eggs, prehaps mix in some cream or 1/2 and 1/2 for richness and add cinnamon or nutmeg.

I made this last night for dessert and it got rave reviews from my husband and children. I thought it was pretty sweet for bread pudding but everyone else said it was perfect and that I should definitely make it again. This is a great recipe if you're in the mood for something very gooey and sweet!

A little on the sweet side, but soooo good. Company raved about it, and my husband thinks it to die for. I'm not a bread pudding fan, and, as a matter of fact, the first one I've ever made...certainly not the last time though.....great!

I never liked bread pudding before I tried this one!  Everyone that I've made this for says its the best they've ever had.  Also, it's so quick and easy to make.  I keep butterscotch chips on hand now in case I need to make it at the last minute. Very, very good.

I made this recipe on thanksgiving and it was a big hit. I made it exactly as described except I used cinnamon bread. It was sweet but very very good. It was even better topped with vanilla ice cream. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for the recipe!

Great recipe!  This was my first time making bread pudding and I couldn't believe how incredibly quick and easy this was. I made this exactly as the recipe is written. Next time I will add more butterscotch chips. The only problem was that I made it just for myself and my son...its a lot of bread pudding for 2 people!!

This was so easy to throw together, I couldn't believe it!  I took others' suggestions and cut the sugar by approx 1/4 cup.  I also added some golden raisins and used chocolate chips instead of butterscotch since it was what I had on hand.  My husband loved it!  A great and easy dessert that's easy enough for a weeknight, but fancy enough for company.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Easy to make and tasted pretty good; it's pretty sweet but was a little goopy (although, I know that's how it's supposed to be). I made this for a big family dinner...everyone tried it but I guess we're not huge bread pudding fans.  Overall it gets 4 stars!

Wow, this was amazing.  I used low fat margarine and added raisins.  I also cut the sugar in half.  The butterscotch chips are very sweet, so I cant imagine using the entire amount of sugar.

Really easy, smelled and tasted great.  The only thing I didn't care for the the texture when it was reheated the next day, kind of rubbery.  But is was perfect right of of the oven.

My husband really likes this, and he can be picky about sweet things.  I still prefer regular bread pudding with a more cinnamon flavor, but he said this tops it!  It was a nice change and a good consistency.  Some bread puddings can be dry, but not this one.

I made this recipe for a luncheon at work and everyone raved about the recipe!  I have made it twice since then, using different types of bread and it has come out wonderfully each time.  I used the entire package of butterscotch chips, though.

Very good, very sweet.  Next time I'll eliminate the chips.
