Delicious!! Made a few changes due to personal preferences. Used baby bella mushrooms (which gave it great texture and thicker broth) and also substituted a couple of handfuls of chopped fresh spinach for kale & swiss chard. I don't usually use vegetable broth so I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor but I would caution the amount of salt. Also would use a bit less rosemary -unless your really love it!! Thanks for the recipe - will be one of our favorites!!

This is great! When compared to the recipe on the bag of 15-bean soup I love the addition of the veggies and the deletion of the meat. I had frozen kale in the freezer but no chard nor crimini on hand. I upped the kale and substituted portabello mushrooms. It was delicious.

I made this yesterday in a slow cooker and it turned out great! I used red kale instead of dinosaur kale because thats what I had and it worked fine. I will definitely make again soon. Thanks for the recipe Tamara. Delish!

Ingredients were not well balanced. Too much carrots and leafy chard did not go well. Beans were under-represented. Seasoning was not the greatest either. the recipe calls to cook the carrots n celerary too early.

This is how 15 beans soup should taste! I have also added potatoes and green chilies. Hearty flavorful and easy to make.

Very good and easy -to-make soup. I used 10 bean soup mix decreased the amount of carrots and added a teaspoon of liquid smoke with a little more salt and served it with homemade flat bread.

I loved this soup.  The only reason that I didn't give 5 stars is that I agree with another reviewer in that it is too heavy on the carrots and celery.  I made 1/2 recipe using 1/2 bag of 15-bean soup mix, and used 2 large carrots and 1 large stalk of celery.  Maybe the recipe author was talking about baby carrots?  For a little extra depth of flavor I added 1/2 teaspoon of celery seed, 1 teaspoon of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar.  Oh, and here's another little thing that I do.  After soaking the beans overnight, the "husks" of the large white lima beans mostly detach and float to the top.  These "husks" are not yummy.  I take about 2 minutes to fish them all out.

Make this a few times a year. Great taste and easy. Would help though if nutrition listed serving size.

This is one if the tastiest vegetarian 15 bean soup recipes I have ever made. A definite keeper! I used a combination of Crimini and Shitake mushrooms which add such a earthy flavor. I particularly liked the omission of tomatoes. This helped in bringing out the flavors of the beans chard and kale.

A new and very happy vegetarian here. So happy I can create a delicious bean soup without the ham and/or bone that my mother used to use. I did not have the mushrooms or chard but it turned out fantastic nonetheless. Thank you!

I wasn't wild about this..I had to add more salt and when that didn't do it I added a little powdered chicken bouillon (and I know that makes it non-vegetarian). The flavoring just wasn't there.

I liked it after preparing it. My wife said it seemed like more work than it was worth.
