The mixture of these 3 simple ingredients in the middle of a round or two of brie are absolutely fabulous together!! I strongly suggest to choose a very small RED onion though. (It ended up being 1 and 1/2 cups total chopped, or 3/4 cup per wheel) Also I also suggest you use portabella mushrooms as I did, and perhaps because of these tweaks I made I ended up needing one more tablespoon of butter. I caramelized the onions first, then added the mushrooms and dates and cooked them for an additional 3 minutes which is when I needed the extra tablespoon of butter. The quantity of filling was so huge (again, most likely from my tweaking the ingredients) that it was larger than the entire wheel of brie, so I decided to split 2 wheels of brie instead of just one in half (using a copper wire to cut them- so easy that way!) and it was the perfect amount for the two 8 ounce wheels of brie. I also chose to cook them in the oven rather than nuke them. 350 for 20 minutes. Thank you and I will use this again- especially for wine tasting parties or as a treat for the holidays.

Everyone at my party loved this!  Very easy.  Watch cooking time though; my first attempt ended up as a puddle on the plate! (after less than a minute in the microwave)  Served it anyway and people gobbled it up!

Man OH Man, is this a GREAT recipe!!!  It is incredibly easy to make, and a huge hit with my loved ones.  I will be serving it again this weekend for a wine tasting at my house.  I absolutely recommend this recipe to you!  You will not have leftovers.  

I recommend using a red onion instead of a regular white onion, as this really adds to the flavor as it caramelizes.  Love it!!!

Over the past 3-4 years, this has become my signature dish for potluck dinners.  My friends actually REQUEST that I bring it.  The combination of sweet dates and savory onions/mushrooms is amazing!  I agree with other reviewers that it often makes more than enough filling, but that just means I get to sample it while I'm putting it together. ;-)  I have to respond to someone's suggestion to "cut the rind off the Brie before serving".  Um, the rind is edible and a big part of Brie's appeal.  Cutting it off not only is unnecessary and would make the wheel look very messy, but it also would reveal the cook's complete lack of knowledge about the dish.  If you don't want a rind, use mozzarella--lol!

I thought this was very good.  The complex sweet/musky/tangy flavor is not something my kids enjoyed, but the adults who tried it at my gathering gave it rave reviews.

I made this for a romantic dinner with my boyfriend (with Honey Garlic Ribs from this site for main course).  It was really yummy!  Went great with our red wine.  My only suggestion would be to definitely slice off the rind (or whatever it's called) of the brie before assembling.  I left it on, and we ended up having to eat around it.

My father-in-law loves brie cheese and I made this as an appetizer for his birthday dinner.  He loved it, as did his wife and my husband who are not big brie eaters.  I would definitely make this again!

This is some seriously tasty stuff!  It is easier to cut the brie when it is chilled so that should be done as soon as the cheese comes out of the fridge.  I held the mushrooms out until the onions had started to caramelize. It took a while for them to start to brown.  The dates were the last to go in after the mushrooms had started to soften.  Watch this when you nuke it.  It only took my microwave a minute to start to melt the brie.  The combination of flavors in this is so tasty sweet, savory and an all around winner.  Thanks for sharing I will make this again for sure.

We served this with baguette. The dates add a nice sweetness to the earthy mushrooms and caramelized onions. I think this needs some sort of crunch or nutty factor; maybe some sliced almonds (possibly toasted). Will experiment with that next time, but still a great appetizer the way it is.

This was UNBELIEVABLE.  It's not really a crowd-pleaser, but if you're up for interesting and unexpected food, then this is great!  Wonderful combination of sweet and umami.  We ate the leftovers up on bread as sandwiches.

Awesome!  We did not care that the onion/mushroom/date mixture was oozing out between the cheese-we just loved this combination of sweet and savory flavors!

My guests RAVED about it, but I just thought it was good. Will add more contrasting flavors and textures next time, as well as more finely dice the mushrooms and dates, etc. so it's easier to eat. Definitely worth keeping and playing with the ingredients to suit individual tastes!

This was the hit of the New Years Eve party I attended.  I doubled the recipe and used a Costco wheel of brie.  I topped it with some candied pecans.  Festive looking and excellent!

Since my family is "cheese rind phobic", I cut the upper rind off. I simple let the cheese come to room temperature. Then place it on a beautiful serving plate. Sauté my onions and mushrooms (I've used a smaller amount of shallots because I didn't have onions and that was great too!) and topped the cheese with it. It makes a beautiful presentation that way as well and everyone gets to smear on what they want, etc. I serve it with grilled baguette slices.

Yummy and wonderfully rich and sweet! The grocery store was out of brie wheels so I used a large wedge, which was probably a lot messier when melted but still very delicious! Even people who didn't like brie were loving this. I served it with baguette slices and it worked out great! Mine definately wouldn't really work with crackers unless they were very large crackers. Wonderful!

Brought this to a Christmas Eve family dinner and it was devoured within 30 minutes out of the oven. Make sure to increase the amount of filling (as much as triple) as thats what makes this dish so heavenly. The balance of sweet and savory is perfect... people were actually spooning the filling onto crackers without the cheese as they were beginning to feel guilty -watching their waistlines- about eating so much of it!

oops, left out a few things. I did not cut brie in half. Instead I topped the brie with the onion mixture. I baked in the oven, not microwave, and topped it with the onion mixture when it came out of the oven.

This was delicious! My husband loves Brie so when I saw this I had to try it. I followed the recipe except that I cooked it in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes as other reviewers did. The mixture of flavors was very tasty. We will be having this again.

Delicious!  The ingredients sound strange together--but they are actually fantastic!  I've made this 3 times now, and it always disappears quickly!  On the advice of another review, I baked the brie in the oven rather than microwaving, which I think works better.

I made this for cooking club when doing a demonstration on Brie cheese. I actually tried it out on them without trying it at home first, and it turned out great! My grandma has even requested this for Christmas this year!

As someone whose idea of a great meal out is just appetizers and desserts, I can say that this is one appetizer that is WELL worth the calories! The orchestration of carmelized onions, mushrooms, and dates is symphonic! That unexpected bit of sweetness just catapults this into the stratosphere. As for the art of heating it until melty, but still in a recognizable form, try using a low power. I started with 2 minutes at 20%, and added increments of 1 minute at that same power until it barely started to melt, which amounted to about 5 minutes total. I served it at my book club tonight, and all the ladies loved it! Of course, crackers always work, but try grapes and apple slices as alternative accompaniments. Simple to put together in about 15 minutes, delicious, and sophisticated.

Very good! I too used red onion and baby portobello and baked it at 350 for 20 min.  However for some reason I had figs on the brain instead of dates while shopping. Oh well it was still yummy. I used a goat brie and served with gluten free crackers. Even my 5 and 10 year old kids liked this one. I will definitely be making this again soon but I will try to remember dates not figs!

My husband and I LOVED this!  We ate it on toasted pieces of cranberry nut bread. Next time I make it I plan to place the sliced Brie on top (upside down), bake in the oven, then discard the rind after the cheese melts.  I will also add some dried cranberries which blend in beautifully with these flavors.

Made this yesterday as an appetizer for a Thanksgiving get together. It was absolutely awesome. I made the recipe as is, but then wrapped the whole thing in a sheet of puff pastry and put it in the oven for 25 minutes. It was exactly right, not too sweet, but not just savory. I got loads of compliments.

I made the first time according to recipe.... Great but most of my family doesn't like the rind.  Next time was cutting off rind, cutting into to small pieces... I then put them into homemade phyllo cups and topped them with the mixture of onions,mushrooms and dates.  I baked for 6-10 min in 350 degree oven.  They loved it!  ( I put more rind in some for myself!)
