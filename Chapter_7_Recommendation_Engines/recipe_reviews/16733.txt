This is the best blue cheese dressing ~ and I love blue cheese! I only order blue cheese dressing on my salads, and have tried numerous recipes.  This is is reminiscent of the restaurant that you went to and said " Wow, now THIS is good blue cheese!"

I made this dressing last night and my husband and I think it's the best we've ever had!  We won't go back to store bought ever again.  
Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't think that it was too thick. I made it with regular mayo (Hellmann's)and lite sour cream.  The consistency was perfect and the taste divine!  Thanks Bob!

Wonderful flavor!  Make sure to add all the ingredients, including the hot sauce.  The bleu cheese has such a strong flavor that the other flavors in the recipe are needed to balance it all out.  I would thin the dressing with a little milk next time, as I would prefer a more "pourable" dressing next time.

While I think this recipe is certainly better than store-bought dressing, I thought there was too much of a mayonnaise taste. I would use less mayonnaise next time and add a little vinegar or other liquid to make it less thick.

Super!  Having moved from America to Australia, I was horrified to find that I can't get blue cheese dressing "Down Under"!  This recipe is a very welcome touch of home, and couldn't be easier to put together.

I think this is simply delicious!  No comparison to a bottled dressing.  I use light sour cream and light mayonnaise, though, and my company even raves about it.

This is a really good dressing.  Thank you so much, Bob...I've been looking for something like this for a long time.  Bottled just doesn't cut it and what a pleasure it was to have a salad at home with this dressing on it.  Wonderful flavor!

I halved the recipe since I'm the only one who likes blue cheese.  I really liked it.  It was a bit thick, but I just added buttermilk, a quarter cup at a time, until it was the consistency I wanted.  The buttermilk thins it out without significantly altering the taste.  We've done that to store-bought dressing for years.

I love the mayo-sour cream base with blue cheese.  It beats the store kind.

I used gorgonzola cheese and left out the hot sauce and honey. But this turned out excellent! I also mixed in some whole milk to thin it out. That's all I had on hand, and I didn't think it would turn out so good, but it turned out great! I'm not going back to bottled dressing again!

A good premise and a nice balance of spices, but way too mayonaisey and a bit too salty.  The Worcestire sauces provides enough salt without having to add any extra.  A keeper, but I think I'll adjust my proportions of mayonaise to sour cream next time.

Thick, delicious, yummy.  I added more chunks than suggested in the original recipe as I like to have big lumps of blue cheese in my salad.  Easy to make.  I used to be a Marie's fanatic, and this beats the dressing they serve in fancy resataurants.  Good job, Bob!

This recipe is absolutely AMAZING!  A bit thick, but just a dab will do you!  It's true, even those who don't like Blue cheese dressing will rave about this!  I have made this time and time again, just as directed with no modifications and it's almost sinfully delicious.  Ignore Bill and try Bob! :-)  Look no further for the perfect dressing!

I was so hopeful when I read this recipe and the reviews,but disappointed in the results. I found the honey gave an odd taste for my palate.
 Thanks anyway Bob.I will keep looking

I didn't use this on a salad, but instead with the buffalo chicken pizza on this website. It was FABULOUS!!! Made it twice in one week. Highly recommend trying it with the pizza. Super yum!

I made this dressing according to the recipe. Too, too salty (blue cheese is salty to begin with) and the honey gave it a rather odd sweet taste. I refridged for 1 hr thinking it may improve over time, but it just got saltier. I dumped it and remade omitting the honey, cutting down the salt to 1/2 tsp, pepper to 1/4 tsp and the Worcestershire to 1 tsp. Perfect

This was amazing.  I am not a fan of blue cheese like my fiancee is, but even I found myself stealing a taste from the bowl here and there.  I made a couple of changes, only because I didn't have on hand any honey or sea salt (I used regular salt).  I used slightly more than 4 ounces of blue cheese, and used a good danish brand.  I then made buffalo chicken pizza (from this site), and it was by far the best I have made yet (I have made that pizza about a half a dozen times now).  You HAVE to make this dressing!! Bravo Bobby!

I loved this dressing.  It was very quick and easy to make and I didn't think the consistency was too thick.  My husband even liked it and he never used blue cheese.  Thx for a great recipe!

OOPS!  I REVIEWED THE WRONG RECIPE

This is sooooooooooo good!  It fits into our eating plan, thankfully. (Suzanne Somers.com) I found it a bit too thick, so added a tablespoon of white wine vinegar.  Very good.  This is especially good drizzled over sliced tomatoes.

Phenomenal. This was ridiculously good. I have tried several of the other Blue Cheese Dressing recipes on here and this one is the best in my opinion. I have to admit to eating this straight out of the bowl with a big old spoon. Gross maybe, but one taste and you'll be doing the same. Only things I changed were to leave out the parsley, because I didn't have any and add a pinch of garlic powder. Blue Cheese stupor coming your way!

This is soooo over the top good!! The only reason I decided to make it was because I purchased some blue cheese and didn't know what to do with the remains. I've never been a big fan of blue cheese dressing but wanted to try something different. The final results after making the recipe as is.......I could eat it with a spoon!!! UPDATE: If you read reviews and decide to thin the recipe down----WAITE - till the next day. I did thin mine down too much with milk and now it is a bit watery - but I'll still eat it with a spoon!!!

I made this recipe thinking it would be the same as the blue cheese dressing from Bob's Big Boy restaurant.  It wasn't the same, it was better!  I did leave out the honey; I tasted it without it and it was so good I was afraid to mess it up.  I did put in about one half teaspoon of sugar thinking just a dab of sweetness would enhance the other flavors, and it seemed to.  I'm usually not a huge fan of blue cheese, but I am now!  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic!  I added 2 cloves of crushed garlic and substituted honey mustard for the honey.  So far I have not gotten it on a salad.  It is used up as a dip using "Scoops".  I will make a double recipe today in hope of getting it on a salad tonight!

This dressing was good! I didn't like the honey. Eventhough I didn't put in much, I could taste it "peeking" through. I added some garlic salt and a little more mayo.

This seems more of a veggie dip than a salad dressing. it is VERY thick and hearty.  We ate it with a veggie tray the second day loved it.

This dressing is wonderful!!! I made it for fathers day and my dad loved it so much that he had 4 hepings of salad. All the salad dressings at the store taste bitter after you've tasted this dressing. Once you taste it, you're not going to settle for store bought again!

I thought the flavor of this was really good - I put it all in the blender to make it more of a smooth dressing and I don't think it was as good as it would have been chunky.  I'll try it again without blending it.

This is a simple and delicious alternative to bottled dressing. I did add a little milk to thin it out a bit, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for sharing!

Just not to our taste.  The Worcestershire was strong and took away from the taste of the bleu cheese.

I make this dressing often.  For carb watchers, add two tablespoons white vinegar, 2 tablespoons sugar substitute instead of honey to the recipe.  Also use equal parts light mayo and sour cream.  Don't forget the hot sauce.  Serve over iceberg wedge.

Excellent recipe!  Originally from Boston, MA, I live in the UK now and haven't found any decent blue cheese dressing since my move.  Per some suggestions made, I omitted the honey and decreased the amount of mayo.  No more bottled dressing for me.

Because I went with what I had on hand, I substituted a tablespoon of sugar for the honey, low-fat sour cream for regular sour cream, and kosher salt for sea salt.  Please note:  If you aren't the adventuresome type ... if you like the "tried and true," this may not be the blue cheese recipe for you. My wife doesn't stick her neck out on new recipes, but she liked it.  Still, she prefers a more standard tasting blue cheese dressing.  I thought the hot pepper sauce really created an interesting twist in this recipe.  Without the hot sauce, it might be just another blue cheese dressing.  Bravo, Bobby.  This is a superb recipe!  Delicous.

This is an awesome dressing. It has become our house bleu cheese dressing. I substitute organic whole milk yogurt for the sour cream because we love yogurt, and I leave out the honey, as I don't think it really adds anything. But however you make it, it's terrific!

This was nice, but I omitted the honey and added more blue cheese. The chunkier dressing atop grilled burgers with caramelized onions was wonderful.

I'd made this before, but didn't realize it until I tasted it again. I chose this recipe since it didn't have to meld for several hours (or an entire day). Unfortunately, all I could taste was the honey! Perhaps if I deleted it, I might like it better. Sorry, I won't (knowingly) make it again.

This Blue cheese is very good, it wasn't quite what I was looking for but still a pleasant dressing.  I agree with other viewers that it was very thick but that was fine for us as we used it for wings and it stuck to the chicken nicely.  I followed the recipe as stated, I did not add any milk to thin it out, however the next day it was super thin and watery.  I'm confused as to how this happened, maybe because I used light mayo? that's the only thing I can think of so if anyone else has a clue I'd love to know!  It tastes fine, and goes easily on a salad now! Lol!

This is the best blue cheese dressing I've ever tasted and it is so simple to make you won't ever go back to bottled blue cheese dressing again. I've used it on buffalo chicken pizza and as a vegetable dip and gotten raves on it:)

I love this dressing!  I made no changes and the flavor was perfect.  I have even made this with light blue cheese, mayo, and sour cream and it is still great.  The longer it sits, the more runny it gets...so make it a day in advance if you dont want your dressing too thick.

This is wonderful!!!  Very creamy, not overpowering, and great taste overall!  I have made several different versions, over the years, and this one is the best.  You have got to try this one with hot wings.  It's the best!

I liked this but I found the honey to be too strong, otherwise a very good dressing.  I liked it better over mixed greens with walnuts then on the Buffalo Chicken strips I tried it on first.  I would definitely make again but without the honey.

I made chicken drummettes and needed blue cheese dip-thought I could    use store bought dressing. Luckily I didn't use that to gage all blue cheese dressings! This recipe is incredible, and I've always had an aversion to blue cheese-now I'm a believer!

This is a good dressing, and was so easy to make.  It is extremely thick, so I added some milk to thin it down.  I increased the blue cheese too.

This is the best tasting blue cheese dressing i've ever made (and the easiest). I dont use exact measurements I just guesstimate, but I used all ingredients required...We served it on burgers and my family just couldnt get enough...This will definately be a house hold dressing! Thank you for sharing!

FANTASTIC. I made this with a wedge of iceburg, crumbled bacon, tomatoes and avacoado. My husband has asked for it everynight since! I did add more blue cheese, but that was just a personal pref.

I think this is really good. I followed it exactly. Next time I would leave out the honey. It’s not bad, just a little different and I like it to be more traditional. I think the other ingredients are perfect and will keep making without the honey or maybe just less. Used it for wings and the consistency was perfect. Could thin out with milk for salad.

I substituted a lot...added real mustard, garlic salt instead of sea salt, apple cider vinegar instead of Worcestershire, avocado oil just because, 1/2 blue cheese & 1/2 feta cheese, spinach instead of parsley flakes, apple honey instead of regular.  I liked this recipe but I think mine came out just as well!

This is a good dressing.  I recommend it for a salad.  I made it to go along with buffalo wings and determined it was too busy for wings.  For wings you want a simple dressing.  I'll make this in the future for a salad.

I love blue cheese dressing, and this was very good! If it is a little thick for you, just add a little milk (or non-dairy creamer like I did), to get it to the consistency that you like. Thanks for the great recipe!

I imagine that part of the secret to a blue cheese dressing recipe is starting with a blue cheese with an irresistibly good flavor, which I did. The brand of mayo may also be a factor in the success. I used Duke's Mayonnaise and was very happy with it. The equal parts of sour cream, mayo and blue cheese in this recipe are just right. Once I mixed these together, then added the lemon, it tasted exactly like what I was hoping the finished dressing would taste like, so I stopped there. I chilled it for a few hours and, to avoid watery dressing, waited to add the parsley until right before serving. Limiting this recipe to the base ingredients makes for a very simple dressing, but it was some of the best blue cheese dressing I've ever had. Others raved over it, too.

I did not like this dressing. It had too much mayonnaise, and the hot sauce took away any good blue cheese taste. Too much pepper and salt as well. Also, too thick. I wasted my money on this one. I'll have to throw it away.

I made this exactly as recipe states.  It is delicious!  Just the right balance between salty and sweet.  The little bit of honey is vital for that balance.  I loved that it was all ingredient I have in my pantry.  it is thick, delicious and on a green salad.  It will be my go to for Blue Cheese Dressing.

you MUST let it sit in the fridge for a bit.  i made it and immediately put some in my salad and it was bleh lol but the next day it was like a completely different dressing, so so so good (not sure if you need to let it sit a whole day, but i did).  we left out the Worcestershire sauce cause we didn't have enough to get it this week and it is still great so i wouldnt worry about it if you dont have it.  we had it with iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, and trader joe's sausage cut up into bits and cooked first

Excellent dressing. Made it as recipe states. I did add just a bit of buttermilk to make it flow better but liked it thick as well. It made a lot of dressing but hope to use it a lot also.

I made small changes: swapped plain Greek yogurt for sour cream, added 1 clove garlic & omitted honey. I'm not a huge bleu cheese dressing fan but this turned out well & I will definitely make again.

This turned out better than expected and used ingredients I already had on hand. I cut the recipe to just 1/4 of the volume. I also used reduced fat mayo, extra lemon juice, slightly less salt, gorgonzola vs standard blue cheese and added shallots. Blended it all up in my handheld food processor since it was a small amount. It turned out super creamy and very thick. It still yielded nearly a cup of dressing, which is more than enough IMO - I don't think it'd store super well for more than a couple of days. It'd be easy to make it into a dip as is or by adding a tad more cheese. I probably won't buy blue cheese dressing at the store now that I know how to whip this up.

After reviewing several others' comments, I decided to follow the recipe as written and OMG!!! This is the best tasting blue cheese dressing I've ever had. It turns out pretty thick, so if you like your dressing thinner, just add a small amount of milk. Be sure to allow the flavors to marry, at least 2-3 hours in the refrigerator. I'll be serving it on a steak salad tomorrow, yummy.

The best blue cheese dressing I've ever had. I'm normally a buttermilk blue cheese fan, but didn't have any and didn't want to head to the store again. This recipe is so easy and delicious. I used Sriracha for the hot sauce and a few diced chives instead of parsley and the flavor combination is amazing. A keeper recipe!

Wonderful!! I love bleu cheese and this recipe does it justice. Note: if you use a cheap bleu cheese, it will taste cheap. It is well worth buying a good bleu. I used Campos De Toledo Spanish Bleu. I left out the honey because I don't like sweet that much and per other reviews, I cut the salt in half. I did not think it was too thick at all. If you get this dressing on your salad in a high-end restaurant, it will be thick! The bottled stuff you get from the store is runny and nasty full of chemicals. Go for the real thing and enjoy!

This is an excellent blue cheese dressing! I've even made it with non-fat plain Greek yogurt replacing the sour cream and it's still delicious. I did add a couple Tablespoons of dry powdered buttermilk (for baking) to the yogurt variation but other than that left it the same. I think the buttermilk mix may help it stay thickened some too. So yummy!

It was a little sweet for me. I thought the honey was unusual ingredient. Next time I'll try a different recipe.

I needed to stray from my usual blue cheese dressing recipe because I had no buttermilk.  So I tried this one.  I don't think I'll go back!  This was very good.  I halved the recipe but made it as is except using dried parsley and adding a bit of garlic powder and onion powder.  It was a bit thick so I did add some buttermilk the next day.  Thanks again!

Yum! my kids who would usually never eat blue cheese were tricked by the honey that gave it a slightly sweet taste. Used on buffalo wings and was great.

I'm giving this 5 stars because I think it is wonderful but this is the first one I've eaten that was not from the grocery store. I may try more in the future just to get a good idea but I will keep this one on hand since it is MUCH better than what I have ever bought. Thank you! :-)

I made this dressing Christmas Day to accompany some buffalo chicken legs that I baked for almost hour and half on 350 also from this site. (mmm mmm good!)  I didn't have quite 4oz of blue cheese because I had used some on my blue cheese burgers also from this site.
Anyway my family loved it!  I served it in a big bowl with fresh cut celery sticks plated under the bowl.  I used fresh lemon juice.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  I'm so glad I made it!  No more bottled for me either!  Thank you!
