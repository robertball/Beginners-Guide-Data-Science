I was taught how to make this rice by a Pakistani friend of mine.  She used Basmati rice, whole cloves, and added frozen peas for color.  It was the first time I had ever seen anyone fry raw rice!  The aroma while the rice is cooking is fabulous - almost unbearable!  She served it with okra that was stewed with tomatoes and we ate by scooping it up with warm pita bread using only our left hands.  It was my first hands - on experience of authentic ethnic cooking, and I have since gotten 'the bug' and continue similar types of cooking adventures.  I will always think of my friend when I prepare this rice - thank you Uzma!

Very easy and delicious rice, even without the cumin seeds (I used ground instead).  Very fragrant.  Next time I will try basmati rice for a completely authentic touch.

This rice was incredible!!! I absolutely loved it. I made it with brown rice and 3 c. of water. It had the best taste.

I enjoyed this recipe, served it this evening with the Beer and Spinach curry off this site.  I liked the final presentation with the onions served on top of the rice, rather than just mixed in.  It is a little longer to prepare and cook than most rice dishes, but well worth it for a tasty change.

This rice went great with the Thai Curry Tofu (also on this site) very simple to make but a safe taste (my husband who doesn't like trying anything "too weird" even liked it) Would definately make again

Very very good! Lots of flavour and a welcome change to regular rice/fried rice. I used brown rice and doubled the recipe. I reduced the water to 4 cups instead as it takes forever to cook rice at this altitude and I have no problems with this ratio. Only thing I wished is for the recipe to say how much salt to include... I didn't know what the overall taste of this should be and I only used a scant 1/4 tsp kosher salt. I think I will use 1/2 tsp next time to soak the rice. Thank you for a wonderful recipe! I will definitely make this again!!

Good recipe and complimented Chicken Adobo very nicely. I used brown rice and subbed in honey for the sugar, I think I would use 1 1/2 or 2 T of honey next time. Otherwise everything seemed about right!

The flavors in this are absolutely excellent. I was worried about biting into the peppercorns but they really are not spicy once you cook then down that long. My husband (who greatly dislikes most Indian food) loved this and requested more! The fried onions on top were a great touch.

Easy and delicious. I reduced the amount of water to 2 1/4c or my basmati would have gone soggy. I'll definately be making this again!

Yummy! Easy and made my house smell amazing! Will make this again for sure, maybe add some shrimp.  I used frozen, pre-cooked brown rice from Trader Joe's and it was delicious.

I enjoyed the flavors of this easy to do rice, but no one else here did. The onions made it great. I didn't have cumin seed and substituted 1/2 tsp cumin powder (I wished now I used quite a bit more) and used basmati rice, and evoo instead of veg oil. I'd make it again if I weren't the only one who'd eat it. 3.5 stars

This was so good. The flavors are so complex and wonderful together. Because my family is picky and prefers plain white rice, I cooked the rice alone (for them) and then followed the rest of the recipe, only skipping frying the rice.  I added some of the cooked rice into the skillet with all the cooked spices and onions. Yum! Thanks.

I doubled the recipe and it still came out, but next time I will up the amount of cumin.  Also, I'm thinking I will add raisins and chopped cashews with the water.  Overall this rice was tasty and extremely fragrant, but I think it could use a few more flavors.

Yum, just like in the Indian restaurant.  Add some frozen peas and carrots and it's the perfect side to any spicy Indian meal.

This is a lovely recipe for a cumin addict like me!  I added the onions back into the rice while it cooked (in the rice cooker!), so their flavour would permeate it.  Fluffy, aromatic, and delish.

I recently served this recipe with a simple shrimp scampi and fresh sliced tomatoes.  We loved it.  It is very aromatic and a wonderful blend of flavors.

This is great, even without the cinnamon and cloves (which I just can't make myself like in savoury dishes). It's a lovely, subtle, utilitarian dish!

Used basamati rice instead of long-grain. Used 1 tsp. of cumin powder instead of 2 tsp. cumin seeds (for 2 servings), I didn’t have the seeds. I ground the cloves myself as I didn’t have ground cloves either. Seemed a bit bland, could possibly use some spicing up. Served with potato curry (on this site) and Murg Makhani.

A sweet rice sidedish that would go well with a curry entree.  We used minute rice so had to modify recipe some.  My husband thought it had a rice pudding flavor.

I was really excited about trying this recipe, it was pretty good, I think there is to much cinnamon and cloves for my families taste though personally i think that next time i make this i will leave that out and just add some garlic with the cumin. I think the cumin is the key with this recipe. thanks for a great alternative recipe for rice. sonya ;)

This is a wonderful recipe. I used brown rice and 4 cups of water. I omitted the onion and used a few dashes of pepper instead of the black peppercorns. The aroma and flavor are superb.

This was pretty good, a little sweeter than I expected but still a great side dish. I servied with Adrienne's Tom Ka Gai soup (recipe also found on this site), and even though this is Indian and that is Thai they went very well together.

I took a suggestion from another reviewer and added peas to the rice and didn't like it. All of the rice tasted like peas, but I could tell that without the peas, the rice would be great. I served the rice with tandoori chicken, parantha, and yogurt. It was a nice Indian style dinner. Lots of wonderful spices filling the air. I will make this rice again.

This is actually quite a yummy recipe although I changed it slightly while making it - I chopped the onions until almost a mash (as my child doesn't like them) and left them in so they were hidden while the other things were also cooking and added more black peppercorns.  It turned out really well!!! And my son who turns his nose up at a lot of new things really liked it too. Thank you Moomal for putting it up on allrecipes.com

Excellent rice recipe, you don't even need the onions for the topping.
