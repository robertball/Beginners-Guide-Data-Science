Do yourself a huge favor and use 2 cans of biscuits. The recipe itself is solid but trying to cram all of the filling into one biscuit is impossible! I ended up having to bake the biscuits plain and use them as buns rather than meat-filled pockets. It was disappointing but next time I try this I'll just remember to buy 2 cans.

This was very tasty. I used a rolling pin to flatten the biscuits super flat after reading a review that 1 can of biscuits isn't enough, which is true. I had some meat left over, but I used a 1/3 cup scoop for each one with a hefty pinch of a three cheese blend. I just pulled up the biscuits like wontons. In the future I would probably simmer the joe mix longer to cut down on the juice a little more. I baked for 12 minutes, checked, and then put back for another 3. I would probably make longer next time. Somewhat labor intensive making the pouches, but worth t if you have patience. If you get frustrated easily, I'd stay away from this recipe.

My family and I love the Unsloppy Joes recipe.  Leaving the Grands' biscuit out of the refrigeration about 30 minutes prior to use will assist with the rolling issues. I may try adding corn and black beans for an extra added treat.  Thanks, Pillsbury!

Love this and clean up was easy. Even the 3yrd thought the "little pizzas" were cool. Next time I may add a little chipotle pepper for zip.

Delicious and super easy.  You will definitely need two tubes of dough.  I accidentally over stuffed mine and they came out calzone size... and didn't ooze. Foolproof recipe.

Loved this and so did the family! I also agree that trying to spread out the dough is a little difficult. I also had lots of leftover meat which made for a good sandwich. We had leftovers of the pockets and they are awesome heated up the next day!!

We make these every few weeks...they are so good! I use Manwich sloppy joe sauce, and we often add chopped onion and green bell pepper just for something extra.

This was very tasty and fairly easy to make. Closing and sealing them was kind of a pain. I added raw onion and sliced pickled jalapenos because that's what I like to put on my regular sloppy Joe's.   I will definitely make them again and use Velveeta instead of shredded cheddar.  I didn't taste the cheese at all but probably didn't use enough.

This is a wonderful twist on an old classic!  I use my own sloppy joe recipe then place that with shredded cheese onto the biscuits.  YUMMY!

Need two cans of biscuits or just a teaspoon of meat in each pouch. Made a huge mess on my favorite cookie sheet.

Very delicious recipe.  Make sure you use the Pillsbury biscuits because I found store brand ones very hard to flatten out without tearing.  I always have extra sloppy joe left over, too, because 1/3 a cup in each makes it very hard to press each one closed without making a mess.
