I really like this recipe, but the second time that I tried it, I made some changes. Instead of using cottage cheese, I used ricotta. I think it gave it a nicer texture, and survived the baking better than the cottage cheese. Also, I drained the spinach by placing it in a paper towel and sqeezing out the excess liquid. Otherwise, the dish becomes very watery.

We loved this recipe!! It had a great flavor and was very filling. A helpful hint, squeeze your spinach dry. I used a hot italian suasage and added onions and garlic to the meat mixture. I also added a can of italian tomatoes (drained well). This dish is a hit and was fought over for lunch leftovers. :)

I was looking or something quick and easy to make for a potluck with ingredients around the house, came up with this, and it was great.  I didn't have sausage so I used ground turkey with some extra italian spices and used about two cups of cooked pasta instead of half of the spinach.  I also used a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes and a 4 oz can of tomato paste instead of the tomato sauce.

Not bad.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  It was kind of flat, but tasted good.  Wasn't my favorite, but I would probably make it again.

We have given up pasta,bread,etc.  This low-carb recipe is just like lasagna without the pasta.  I add more italian spice to it and have even used ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  My husband loves it!!

This was a pretty good recipe.  I used fresh spinach, as well as sauteed garlic & onion.  I was a little unsure about using fresh spinach, but it worked fine.  Mine was a little bit soupy, so we put it over the Asparagus Zucchini Rice recipe from this site.  It made a suprisingly good combination.

I need to re-do this recipe a bit before 5-star rating.  Definitely drain spinach on paper towel, as suggested by another user--frozen spinach never drains well and leaves dish a bit soupy and more spinachy flavor than spinach haters would tolerate.  I also would like to try ricotta rather than cottage cheese; even if it's more calories, it is atkins friendly and will blend much better. The flavor was very good as is.  I just want to work on the appearance and consistency of the final dish.

This was really good! Made as directed and turned out fabulously!  Even my picky eaters loved it!!  Great way to serve up some spinach and using fat free cottage cheese and turkey sausage made for a lower fat recipe! :)

This was amazing. Huge hit at the dinner table. Swapped cottage cheese out for ricotta. Definitely will make this again and again!

I substitued ricotta for the cottage cheese, used one can of tomato paste and one can of diced tomatoes with garlic and basil instead of tomato sauce.  It was absolutely delicious and made wonderful leftovers.  Thank you!

Very different and very tasty. I used two packages of creamed spinach rather than just plain spinach (and left out the eggs and cheese) for the bottom layer and then put the sausage on top. I left off the mozerralla and topped it with buttered breadcrumbs and parmesean cheese to add a crispy topping.

Really good.  My husband is not a huge fan of cottage cheese, so I used 1 c. of it and dotted the spinach mixture with 2 oz. of LF cream cheese.  I used turkey sausage and all low-fat cheeses very successfully.  Served over angel hair it was even better!

This was VERY good - used Ricotta instead of Cottage cheese and sauteed fresh baby spinach with onion and garlic.It was like Lasagna without the noodles.  my 9 year old loved it.  Definitely part of my regular mix now!

I halved the recipe for 4 people.  Just before putting it into the oven I sprinkled granulated garlic over the top.  After removing the casserole from the oven I let it sit on a trivet for 20 minutes and then cut it into servings.  My husband and I loved its flavor.  I did not serve any sides with it and it was plenty satisfying.

I used low fat chicken sausage, leftover spaghetti sauce from an earlier meal, non-fat cottage cheese and just one package of spinach.  I think the texture would have been better with ricotta cheese.  Good on its own, leftovers even better over pasta!

Another low carb dish to add to the recipe book!  I simply added some pepper, onion salt, and garlic powder and my family of five loved it!  My husband was licking the spoon while he was helping me clean up - that's always a good sign!  :)

If you're a sausage and cheese lover, you'll really love this recipe.  I consider myself to be a "sausage gourmet", whatever that means.  I highly recommend everyone to try this one.

Excellent! My wife likes about one out of ten of my meals - and this one she loved. I used left-over pork sausage & tomato sauce and cut the recipe basically in half.

had to make some subs due to what I had in the pantry vs. what the recipe called for. The flavor was good, added some garlic and onion to the meat sauce. Used fresh spinach and mixed the cheese and spinach in the food processor. Red sauce came out a little soupy because of the tomatoes. There were no leftovers and my youngest begged me to make it for dinner the next night too. Next time I'm going to add some pasta into the mix...

This was really good - I made only a couple of minor changes based on reading the reviews.  I used hot Italian sausage and added diced onion and garlic while I was browning it.  I only used one package of spinach and squeezed it with a towel to get most of the liquid out.  I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and added some oregano into the mixture. I think next time I'll add black olives to the cheese topping.  Thanks for sharing!

I enjoyed this recipe. I eat low carb so it was perfect. I don't think I would change anything, well, maybe I will add some garlic and onion like some of the other reviews did to add more flavor.

This recipe was very easy to make which was a plus for a weeknight meal.  It was good, but not spectacular, so I'm not sure if I would make it again.  We did decide to use ricotta instead of cottage cheese based on others' suggestions.  Good low carb dinner.

This is really good!  The 2 men in my house loved it.  I added 3 cloves of minced garlic and a small onion and sauteed it with the sausage.  I also added 1 can of drained Italian tomatoes along with the tomato sauce.  I used shredded 6 cheese Italian in place of the mozarella.  I drained and dried the spinach.  I think you will get the liquid separation as long as you are using the tomato sauce.  This was not a big deal for us.  Will definitely make this again!

This recipe is amazing!  My husband is trying to lose weight and to make matters difficult, he is a very picky eater.  I have had difficulty finding recipes that are less than 400 cal per serving that have good flavor and are filling.  This recipe is perfect and fits my criteria.  I did do a few things differently.  I made it with chicken sausage (to cut saturated fats).  I also sauteed minced garlic and onions and added it to the tomato sauce.  I also made sure to drain as much fluid out of the spinich as possible so that it wouldn't make the recipe soupy.  Honestly, I loved the cottage cheese in the recipe so it really doesn't need to be made with ricotta (which has more fat and calories).  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It will be a family favorite at our table for years to come...

I made this for supper last night and thought it was good. I followed the recipe exactly and even though I drained the spinach, it was still watery. I also drained the grease off the sausage but it was still a little greasy.

I didn't care for this much at all.  The ingredients didn't blend well with each other at all.  You could taste each one individually.  But I gave it 3 stars cause my older boys devoured it.  (Maybe there wasn't anything else in the fridge?)  LOL

Everyone like this.  I have kids who would rather eat nothing but hot dogs and a husband who thinks he doesn't like cottage cheese.  They all ate this up and asked to have it again.

This recipe was received well by my family.  We found it a little salty, but think some adjustment of ingredients would help.  Also, the type of sausage might make a difference.  The sausage that I used was a little salty on its own.  Another brand I think would have been better.  But, it was very easy, fast, and a pretty dish to serve.  I added a little black pepper to the spinach mixture, and a little garlic and fresh basil to the sausage mixture.  We all decided that this recipe was a keeper.  Thank you.

Have made this a couple of times now. My family really likes it. I did make one substitution from the get go. To save time I used hardwood smoked rope sausage. I sliced the rope to about 1/4 inch thick, and then cut the slices in half again. (You could even quarter the pieces if that size suits you.) The rope sausage adds a nice flavor to the whole dish, and as a bonus, you won’t dirty an extra pan cooking the meat.

It’s a keeper! Made it with spicy Italian sausage and half the spinach, squeezed it out to make sure it was not too wet when defrosted.

Loved this dish! Great low carb meal that the whole family will love. I did make some modifications; I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and I diced up a jalapeño and added to the sausage. I used garlic spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce. I also sliced a tomato and added to the top before adding the cheese. Lastly, I ran out of mozzarella so I mixed it with cheddar cheese. It tasted great!

I admit to adjusting the recipe to suit what I had on hand and for 4 people, but still rate it highly for the taste combination and ease! I used 4 grilled Italian sausages sliced into coins heated with a half jar of spaghetti sauce and 8 oz can of tomato sauce. I sauteed two 5 oz bags of fresh baby spinach and about 8 oz fresh mushrooms in butter, seasoned with garlic powder and onion powder, then drained well of all liquid. I combined the spinach mixture with half a 15 oz container of ricotta, 1/4 c shredded Parm, 1 beaten egg,  Sprayed a 8 x 8 dish with Pam, spread spinach mixture on bottom, topped with sausage and sauce, then mozzarella. Baked the same as original recipe and let sit before eating. Served with garlic bread. Delicious! Even hubby who curled his lip at the spinach part of the recipe loved it. Will make this again!

I used a jar of Ragu that I needed to use up and it was very good. Simple fast tasty meal. It made about 10 servings so should freeze well. A little bit of tweaking and I'll add this to my low carb recipes.

I'm on an ultra low carb high-fat diet, so this recipe was suitable. It tastes exactly like lasagna only without the noodles. I will most likely make it again.

Like other  reviewers, I used ricotta cheese. I also used fresh baby spinach instead of frozen, and full-fat cheese.   It was quick and easy on a work night and my husband liked it too.

Craving lasagna but trying to stay low carb? this is your answer! it's sooooo good, I crave it. the leftovers are awesome too. we make it a bit healthier by using sweet Italian turkey sausage and fresh spinach. if you use fat free cheese too, there are less than 300 calories per serving! yes, it is a little watery, but it's more like a thin delicious sauce... doesn't bother us at all. lots of protein, low fat, low carb... it's a regular in our rotation!

Easy to make and tasted good. I think I would like it better with tomato sauce with basil, garlic, and oregano and maybe a little Italian seasoning added in. Or perhaps if I used hot Italian sausage. But it's okay, just not as flavorful as it could be.

I used this recipe as the base layers of an egg dish for brunch. I added a mix of 11 eggs, 3/4 milk, and 2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese to the top. Increase the temp and/or baking time to compensate for added volume. I'll experiment with reviewers' recommendations, but it sure was a hit as written. I will definitely make this again!

This was a major hit in our house! We had an abundance of frozen spinach to use. The only minor adjustment I did was to add about a tablespoon of garlic powder to the sausage when browning, because the tomato sauce we had was very plain. Also mixed in about half a tablespoon of onion powder to the spinach-cheese mixture.

Excellent flavor. I had only one box of spinach so I added a cup of frozen peas. Drying the spinach is a very good idea. I also added some oregano and basil to the vegetable mix. I had no cottage cheese or ricotta and substituted a mix of parmesan and asiago. Would make it again in a heartbeat.

I rated this 3; but it was a 4 with changes made by others' suggestions:  - Use ricotta instead of cottage cheese  - Saute half an onion and some garlic Next time we're going to try putting this over pizza dough and baking it.  Yum!

This definitely needs garlic and onion and also more tomato sauce for the amount of spinach. I served it with garlic bread and my husband really liked it, but I thought it needed more flavor.

MUST use ricotta and really drain the spinach, as others have said. Good meal to make ahead, stick in the freezer and bake up on a night when you're short on time.

This was very good.  We don't care for sausage so I substituted ground beef and used ricotta cheese instead of the cottage cheese.  Very tasty!

i like the foundation for this recipe but i think that if you cut up the sausage and also use triple the tomatoe sauce that it would be 5 stars definately!!

I am not fond of cottage cheese, so I substituted 1 package of soft tofu.  I cut
up the tofu about to the size of the cottage cheese and just added it instead.
Absolutely wonderful.

This dish was wonderful!  Very easy to put together and even the die hard spinach haters in my family loved it.
