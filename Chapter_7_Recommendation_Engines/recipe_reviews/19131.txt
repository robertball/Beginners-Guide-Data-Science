This was very difficult to make.  It took too much time.  What added to the difficulty is the fact that my chicken was not completely defrosted.  I also was confused with the directions when it came to the sauce.  I wasn't sure if it was to be part of the marinade or a dipping sauce for afterwards.

A messy recipe.  The lemon marinate is a good tip because it makes the drumsticks very moist and tender.  I used the juice of two lemons.  2 tablespoons is not enough.

The Chicken came out yummy, but there was WAY too much mess and work for the results. Also my picky 5 year old wouldn't eat it because she didn't like the smell.

I halved this recipe but used the full amount of lemon juice. This turned out good but as others said, it is very time consuming so plan ahead. I think it would have been even better if the chicken was double dipped for extra crunch.
