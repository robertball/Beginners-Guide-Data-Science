AWESOME flavor! High fat content though, so I reduced the (olive) oil to 1/4 cup instead of 1 cup...same fabulous taste (tried it both ways to be sure). My family's new favorite dressing!

I halved the honey and still thought it was too sweet however overall it was a very nice dressing.  Delicious with a chicken salad.  I will definately make it again...just with even less honey next time.

For three servings, I used the proportions of 1/4 cup oil, 1/4 cup honey, 2 Tblsps Dijon mustard and 2 Tblsps lemon juice.  I thought it was just about right.  Thanks for such an easy and good recipe.

Very simple to make and tasty.. however I agree that it is way too sweet-cutting down on the honey and abit more mustard is a good tip.

Delicious! I prepared it with agave nectar instead of honey and decided to add more mustard because it was too sweet for my taste.

We loved this. I didnt measure anything, but used a spicy brown mustard container that was on its way to being empty. Added olive oil, lemon juice and honey. Shook it up until it all blended and we loved it. Thanks for the idea!

Basically, this is a good recipe and I was happy to find one that didn't use mayo.  However, it calls for ALOT of honey and the recipe doesn't need as much. I ended up adding extra mustard and lemon juice to compensate for the honey. I also used olive oil instead of vegtable oil.  Overall, I will use a variation of this again. I'll cut the honey almost in half. I liked another reviewer's idea of using apple cider vinegar. Maybe I'll try that too.

Very tasty. A tad on the sweet side, so I think next time I will reduce the amount of honey. I used a bit of yellow mustard and a bit of stone ground honey dijon mustard. This would be a great dip for chicken strips!

Good dressing.  I had planned on making a honey mustard but was out of mayo so I tried this and it came out well.  It is very sweet.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable and used half regular mustard and half dijion.  I prefer creamy dressings but this dressing was still good.

This is definitely better than any you buy at the market.  I used the portions one other person suggested for three servings.  I added 1 tbsp. cider vinegar and a little less honey.  It was very good and very fast!

I was surprised I liked this recipe as much as I did.  I am not a huge fan of honey mustard dressing.  The dressing is very sweet, but had a little bit of tange as well.  I decreased the recipe to make one serving but had more than enough dressing for three dinner side salads.  I will likely make this the next time I want a quick and easy salad dressing.  It is by far better than what you buy bottled.

This sounded good but it was just too sweet for a salad dressing. I would suggest less honey and perhaps more of the mustard.  I probably wouldn't make again.

Great base, had to double the mustard because it was a bit too sweet from the honey for our taste. This makes a large amount, even cutting the recipe in quarter it filled more than half a dressing bottle. Overall it was really good!

This is pretty darn tasty.  I made a quick roast beef, avocado and tomato spinach salad but needed a dressing.  I scaled this down for 1 servings and used: 1 Tbsp honey, 2 tsp olive oil, 1 tsp reduced fat mayo, 1 tsp lemon juice + 1 tsp mustard and it was the perfect topper to my salad.

I've made this recipe a few times now, I just cut the recipe in half as it makes a lot. I didn't make any changes to the recipe the first time I made it, tasted like  a copy cat of Wendy's honey mustard salad dressing, it's fantastic! The last time I ran out of Dijon so I used regular mustard that was also fantastic! It's summer time, Honey mustard time ;)   :)

This recipe stood out by tasting like it had been refrigerated 8 hours in advance, even though it was served,  almost immediately after preparation.

Much, much too sweet. I made a smaller batch using the same proportions, and ended up adding a lot more mustard, oil, and vinegar. If I made it again I'd use half the honey and double the mustard.

just like it says: easy and good, BUT way too sweet -- use 1/4 of the honey.

This is the only salad dressing I use anymore.  My advice is to test it while making- I felt it had way too much honey, and add almost as much mustard before it is really balanced.

This is a delicious salad dressing and so much better then anything you could possibly purchase.  I combined all the ingredients and put it in a blender....so good!!!
