I made this last night. It is delicious and easy! We liked it better than any of the other chicken parmigiana recipes I have tried! The quick tomato sauce is excellent. I pureed it a bit with my immersion blender, but the texture is a personal preference. The taste is what counts! I used homemade bread crumbs for the breading. I pounded out the chicken breast fillets a bit, and they were done in the 10 minutes stated. I liked not having to transfer it to the oven to complete the cooking and melt the cheeses. The cheese melted beautifully over the hot tomato sauce while the chicken was "resting". My husband raved! I'm throwing out all my other chicken parmigiana recipes. This one is it!!

This was so good!  My sauce came out a little thinner than I would have liked, so I added a can of tomato paste; that made it perfect.  Also, I adjusted it a bit so I wouldn't have to do anything when I came home from work.  Rather than cook the chicken all the way through, I just browned it in the frying pan.  Then, I transferred it to a casserole dish, covered it with the sauce, and topped it with the mozzarella cheese.  I then covered it and baked it at 350 for about an hour and a half.  This worked out great for my situation.

I can only give this three stars because the sauce was absolutely terrible!!!  (sorry, no offense).  We find can tomatoes are so bitter they are awful.  What I did was make the chicken as it says (but without the egg due to allergy) then instead of the sauce I served with Ragu jar speghetti sauce and then the moz cheese and speghetti noodles; then it was a 5/5.

Im not a great fan of Chicken Parmigiana but my husband is. I used this recipe last night and it is absolutely wonderful. The only trouble was i kept taking a spoonfull of the sauce whilst waiting for the chicken to cook. I will definately use this again :D

Me likes !!!!!
The only change: up the spices in the sauce ( at least 2t garlic, add some basil and don't forget good ol' salt 'n peppa) and the breading. I also used a bit more cream in the sauce.
I love that it doesn't need an oven or broiler. Have to admit that I sometimes give this a zap under the grill to help if I use sliced Mozzarella.
Serve with good, crunchy garlic bread.... hmmm what's for supper??

Gave this recipe a try and was very pleased. Took the hint from Junebug and pounded the chicken a bit and also replaced the sugar with a single packet of Splenda then hit it with the blender. The sauce flavor is quite similar to a traditional marinara sauce I found at Trader Joes. A jar of the sauce makes this a quick and easy recipe.

Delicious, and highly recommended! I made two changes. One, I used fresh, peeled and seeded tomatoes instead of the canned diced tomatoes. Second, I used a slice of smoky provolone cheese instead of the mozzarella and parmesan cheese topping, but left the parmesan in for the breading. Both changes turned out really well. Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled the sauce and added about a tsp of sugar.  I zapped it with my immersion blender prior to adding the cream.  I baked the chicken for 30 minutes at 350 instead of pan frying.  It was quite good and my family loved it.  It will absolutely make more appearances on my dinner table.

My 11 year old daughter, who wants to be a chef, decided that this would be her first recipe to try out on the family and guests!!  Well, with a little help in pounding the chicken and frying in oil, she created a masterpiece that everyone raved about for days!!  She did decide to use a jar of 4 cheese "Classico" spaghetti sauce, instead of diced tomatoes, and then add all the cream and spices to that.  Otherwise, we kept the recipe the same.  The cheese didn't melt quite right, so we stuck it under the broiler for a minute, and PRESTO!!  Her signature dish...OK, this was her first dish, but she's well on her way to becoming the next Food Network Star.....with a little help from Allrecipes!!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe you can be proud of!!  We are!!

For those that really liked the recipe (REAL Italian or not), just use your own favorite sauce, and then follow the directions.  I find, putting the sauce on the chicken before baking produces a soggy breading.  Put chicken in baking dish after sauteing, place lots of Mozzarella on top, then bake until cheese melts.  Take out of oven, pour desired sauce over and sprinkle with fresh Parmesan!  Delicious.

This is amazing! The recipe is simple, and the outcome is phenomenal! I did add a half a can of tomato paste to thicken the sauce a little, but it was delicious even before that! So yummy!

This is an awesome recipe.  I did season my chicken more.  I also added more parmesan cheese, salt and pepper to the bread crumbs.  I used panko bread crumbs.

Sometimes the kids complain if it's to "different" Thanks for posting.

My boyfriend thinks I'm some kind of Italian chef now haha :)  The recipie is very easy to follow and it didn't seem to take that long to make.  Add pasta and garlic bread and it's an instant hit!  I did double the sauce to have enough for pasta.

Very tasty recipe.  I used a can of tomato paste to thicken the sauce like some recommended.  For the breading, I used dry Italian bread crumbs with some melted butter mixed in. For the pasta to go with this,  I used Linguine.  After cooking the Linguine pasta, I placed it in the bottom of a casserole dish and then spooned a little of the sauce on top. Then I placed the cooked/fried breaded chicken, sauce and cheese' on top.  I then put on low Broil for a few min to just melt/brown the  cheese'.  I  used fresh sliced mozz cheese along with the parma .

Pretty good, not sure why others seemed to have trouble with the chicken staying crispy.  I pounded the chicken until it was pretty thin.  Then I soaked in the egg mixture, dipped in breadcrumbs, soaked in egg mixture, dipped in breadcrumbs again. Then I cooked in olive oil for about 8 minutes...came out perfect.  I think double dipping may be the key

This is a really great recipe-We will DEFINITELY make it again!!! While its strength was the amazing sauce I would DEFINITELY double the recipe as there wasn't nearly enough. We sided it with Fiori pasta and would have loved to have draped it with more sauce! The chicken itself was a little bland- not sure what seasoning I'd use to spice it up a little though...hmmm. Also, instead of flattening the chicken we sliced it into cutlets. *Made this with the help of my 10 and 11year olds. There were plenty of things for each to do to feel involved- but be careful as there's a LOT going on in the stovetop area.

This tastes like something from a restaurant!  The sauce has wonderful flavor and I love the chunks of tomato and onion!  The only addition I made was adding some basil to the sauce.  I'll definitely make this again!

A winner in the recipe department and I will definately make again. The hint of cream throughout really tantalises the tastebuds! 5 Stars all the way!

This is a good base to start with but I had to make a lot of tweaks to get it where I thought it needed to be. Chicken first: I used panko bread crumbs instead of plain, added about 1tsp oregano, 1tsp basil, 1/2 tsp parsley, 1/4tsp ground rosemary, and 1/2tsp granulated garlic. I pounded the breasts out to 1/4" thickness, then let them sit in the breading mixture in the fridge after dipping in the egg while I prepped sauce. 

To the sauce I also added about 3tbsp more sugar because canned tomatos are kind of bitter, basil, organo and parsley as well as using my own roasted garlic instead of minced. You have to use more because the roasted garlic is very mellow, I used around 6 cloves, and I mashed it and steeped it in the cream after heating the cream in the microwave. I added a bit of red pepper flake for just a bit of bite, too maybe 1/8 tsp, 1/4 if you like it spicy. I simmered the sauce for as long as it took to boil the water and cook the pasta, then added the garlic steeped cream just 2 min before serving. 

I started the chicken on medium high heat about halfway through the pasta cook time, and with it pounded so flat it was timed perfect to be done right as the pasta needed to be drained. The panko made sure the breading stayed crisp and the extra seasoning in the breading and sauce made a huge flavor difference. 

My husband isn't normally a fan of chicken with anything tomato and he loves this and asks for it at least once a month.

As written, I would give this recipe 4 stars, but all it needs to elevate it to the five stars I did give it is to add some basil and oregano to the sauce as it simmers. It is far too bland without the addition of these classic and delicious herbs.

Otherwise, this is a delicious recipe!

I've never used heavy cream with my tomato sauces to get that "creamy" texture - but have had good success using either Gorgonzola or Ricotta cheese.

I have been making this recipe for a couple years now and can't believe I've never rated or reviewed it! This is my and my BFs, and everyone in his house, favorite! This recipe is perfect as is; however, every time I end up adding may more cream than stated- simply because I simmer it much longer (about 25 minutes total) and just keep adding the cream. The end result as far as thickness goes though, is the same. Also, I take a sweet onion and just chop it up into small pieces, instead of using minced onion, same with the garlic. I think everyone has their own way of breaking chicken- whatever your favorite way is, do that. This recipe is what everyone now calls my specialty. And I couldn't be happier that it was posted! Thanks Jules! If you're thinking about trying this, but are unsure or intimidated- TRY IT!! You will be thanking Jules as well. ENJOY!!

followed the recipe exactly.  there was not nearly enough sauce for the pasta and chicken.  listen to others suggestions about adding herbs to the sauce too.  otherwise it is bland.  it was a good recipe, but would definitely double the sauce next time

We made this recipe tonight, and we were very dissapointed. Because of the canned tomatoes and sauteeing the onions and garlic, wish gave it a bitter taste, this dish has a bad after taste, not to mention it needs Italian seasoning. If we ever make this dish again, I would use roma tomatoes sautee the onions only until transparent then add the garlic .

Made this for Valentine's Day because I really liked the "romantic meal" idea mentioned here and in other reviews.  My hubby also *loves* chicken parmigiana - it's his staple at most italian restaurants.  So, this dish was kind of a no-brainer.  :)  His only complaint?  "You didn't make enough."  HAHA!  This really is a fantastic dish, and perfect for special occasions.  I will be making this again!

Made this last night almost exactly as stated & it was absolutely delicious! The simple sauce I would not change at all. I did bake my chicken in the oven after pounding the pcs flat & coating them. Just a bit healthier. But thank you for the awesome recipe! It's a keeper.

This is really good.  I only made a couple of tweaks.  I used a can of tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes (I don't like chunks of tomato in my sauce), omitted the sugar,  and added some oregano to the sauce.  My 22 year old pronounced it fantastic.  I made 4 chicken breasts instead of 3 and the amount of sauce was perfect. (I did need a half cup of bread crumbs instead of 1/3.)  I put it under the broiler because I like my cheese browned and bubbly, not just melted, but that's just my preference.  Really tasty and easy dish.

Excellent, my home smelt so good. Next time I will double the sauce as I found it could have used more. It was like a gourmet meal that took little fuss. I will definately make this again. My family loved it.

Delicious! I'll make it again. I double-coated the chicken by dipping in egg/crumbs/egg/crumbs because we like a thicker "crust." Also, baked it instead of frying. I plan to make it again with a different sauce I found in this recipe: Eggplant Parmigiana Caponata. By the way, I used a generic brand of diced tomatoes... don't do that. This recipe hinges on ingredients that taste good before you start cooking.

This chicken dish was delicious! I have had it in restaurants but this was better. Tender and juicy, instead of frying it all the way, I browned the crumbed pieces and baked them in the turbo oven until they were done. This gives the oil a chance to drain as well.  I couldn't help but tamper with the sauce. I didn't add the cream and I added oregano. To the crumbs I added onion powder, paprika and a pinch of salt.

Love this. I made a few alterations to it (brined the chicken, used some panko crumbs along with regular crumbs) and made my own sauce. Hubby and son loved it, will make again!

My fiance loves the sauce for this recipe (I like it as well, but he LOVES it!), and with a tiny bit of tweaking, we both love the chicken portion.  I make sure to pound the chicken down and reduce the cook time, plus I use a heavy-handed teaspoon of both basil and oregano in the crumb mixture.  If I'm short on time, I skip the sauce portion and just make the chicken part and top with spaghetti sauce and a mixture of 1/4c mozz and 1 T packaged parmesan.  Yum.

What a great, easy-to-make recipe!  Love how easy the sauce is to make. The first time I made this I used sour cream as I didn't have heavy cream on hand.  The second time I made it with the heavy cream and found that I liked it with the sour cream better.  I never dreamed that chicken parmigiana could be so easy to make!

This is the first time I've fried chicken, and it turned out great.  Only changes I made were substituting the heavy cream w/1 tbl. butter & 3 tbl. of milk and I used finely crushed Ritz crackers for the breading (which was wonderful!).  We had leftovers for the sides, but next time I'll definitely make it with pasta b/c this recipe makes a lot of sauce.  I also might blend the tomatoes as others have suggested to make it smoother. This is probably going to be a regular from now on!

Delicious...the chicken was really flavorful, and I loved the tomato and onion chunks in the sauce. I made a little more sauce by doubling the cream and adding about half a jar of spaghetti sauce that I had leftover in the fridge. Served over linguine with a garden salad...a really hearty meal!

Amazing recipe!!! One of the few things where leftovers get eaten. My only suggestion is to pound out the chicken.

Great recipe!  Easy to prepare and turned out delicious.  Added a little more sugar to the sauce but other than that I stuck to the recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

I used this recipe for the chicken part, and used a jar of marinara sauce, adding onions, garlic, and yellow squash. I also sliced fresh mozzarella and melted on top it while the chicken was cooking in the pan. Held off on the heavy cream, too. Tenderized the chicken so it cooked more evenly in the pan. All in all, pretty tasty!

Loved the lighter, more delicate sauce, and it was a good fit since I had all the ingredients. Served it over fettuccini noodles.

This is now my favorite chicken parmigiana recipe.  I made a few minor changes.  I used a couple of table spoons of corn starch in the bread crumbs for a better crust.  I use fire roasted diced tomatoes which give it a really nice twist and for a bit of a kick a some red pepper flakes in the sauce.  I won't make any other chicken parm now and anybody who tries it loves the different take on this classic dish.  They're always asking for the recipe.  Oh, and I double the sauce portion of the recipe so I have some for the pasta too.

This is the beauty of Allrecipes, you get great recipes that you can build on, and this is one of them.  My only recommendation is that you  double the sauce, you're going to want more.  I also put the chicken in a baking dish and poured the sauce over the chicken.  I kept the dish warm until ready to serve. My family wanted mashed potatoes, so I added the cheese to the potatoes instead of on top of the chicken.

This was easy and my husband loved it. I always put cream cheese in my spaghetti sauce. It helps cut the acid. So I subbed the cream cheese for the light cream. I would add a little seasoning to the sauce next time as it was a tad bland. But I love a recioe I can make with stuff I already have in the cupboard. All of the ingredients are pretty common. It's a keeper.

Made this for my family of picky eaters and they loved it. I made mine more kid friendly by blending the sauce after it was done (my kids won't eat the sauce if it's chuncky) and it came out great! Will definetly make it again.

Decided to whip this up as the daily suggestion on Sunday, and I am glad I did! We had all the ingredients on hand, and it went very fast. I served it over spaghetti noodles, and everyone loved it, including my 2-1/2 year old! (of course she'll eat anything you tell her is "chicken", but this truly was!) Quick, easy, and tasty! I am not sure how it would turn out, but you might try draining the tomatoes and jsut adding a little water to simmer, and then add the cream as normal, it might thicken up the sauce a bit.

Made this last night.  Tasted like a restuarant made it.  Took the diced tomatoes and blended them in a processor (don't like the chunks) added a small can of tomatoe sause.  Added a pinch of crush red pepper flakes.  Also used light cream. Didn't have heavy cream.  Served with linquini pasta.  It was amazing.  Try this recipe.  It is a really good one.

The sauce could have been more Italian had the cream been omitted.  Other wise the sauce was fine.  Next time I make this dish I will omit the cream and add some basil that is frozen in ice cubes and I will cook the sauce down to thicken it.

I was very disappointed.  The sause was thick after adding a little tomato paste was bland. The chicken was ok but I'd do it in the oven.  Needs to be severed with a light noddle if any at all.er

This was totally AWESOME!  The sauce was creamy and rich...we just wanted more.  I served it on spaghetti with butter and parsley, but would have used the extra sauce if we had it.  The only thing I changed was to add a bit of Italian seasoning to the sauce itself and used seasoned bread crumbs (it was all I had).  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly as written.

Very tasty indeed!  A few things we took from other reeviewers:
1. Add some fresh basil with the cream
2. More garlic is better
3. I doubled the sauce since this is plenty of chicken for six people and hey: more sauce.

With the remainder of the greasing and egg mixture, I blended well and fried it in the pan after the chicken.  Decadent, delicious, "free" appetizer!

Easy to do but worth only 3 stars because sauce was missing a bit of taste and maybe next time I will try crushed tomatoes instead of diced. Nice try but no cigar ;-)

I love, love, LOVE chicken parmigiana.  This recipe was Awesome!  I don't know what that other lady was talking about, because I WILL be making this according to THIS recipe.  I ALSO intend to make this dish for friends and family.  I thought my fiance would not like it due to the sugar that was added, but seasoning to taste with salt AND pepper?  Trust me it does the trick.  Very delicious.

Amazing!  I was a little skeptical about the sauce due to other user's comments, but WOW!  The longer you keep the sauce warm, the thicker it begins to get, so I added another can of tomatoes and another 1/4 cup heavy cream.  My whole family loved this last night, and actually requested left overs for lunch today.

This turns out to be a definite keeper.  I didn't have heavy cream but it worked fine with half and half.  My husband asked me to keep this one and make it again.  He's not usually big on heavy tomato sauces so this was perfect!  Thank you for sharing.

Absolutely delicious!!! I left out the Parmesan cheese to melt on top, because I didn't have any. Also, I used milk with butter instead of heavy cream. I doubled the sauce recipe to have with penne pasta as well and it was soooo good! A new favorite!

Chicken was good, but something missing in the sauce. Tasted too much like canned tomatoes.

I was amazed at good this taste and the sauce was so good! I used Evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream and I used flour instead of bread crumbs and no eggs or milk was added to my chicken. Next time when I do this recipe...I will add more sauce though.

This recipe is awesome!!  Me and my husband loved it, and will have again soon.  I didn't have diced tomatoes or heavy cream, so I substituted crushed tomatoes and evaporated milk.  I will make it again that way, as we enjoyed it so much.  It tasted like a restaurant dish.  We served it with spaghetti (with the same sauce on top) and green beans.

My family loved this, however I'm not a huge fan of Chicken Parmigiana.  I will make this again but I think I will use another reader's advice and blend it a bit as it was a pretty chunky sauce.  I love chunky sauces but for this dish it might've been nice to have been a little smoother.  I served this over spaghetti. Also, next time I might use fresh mozzerella rather than pre-shredded as it didn't melt as nicely as I would've liked.

I used fresh chopped tomatoes and added water, and some tomatoe paste. I left out the sugar.  This recipe was wonderful. The sauce was so tasty that our daughter wanted some on her pasta. I will make it again!

I used a kg of chicken scallopini cutlets so I needed a lot more bread crumbs, 2 1/2 cups which I seasoned with oregano, basil, garlic powder, onion powder, pepper and parmesan cheese. I also did a flour dredge then egg wash then bread crumbs as I find it makes a better coating. When I was done pan frying the chicken I placed it in the oven on warm, then made the sauce. For the sauce I used fire roasted tomatoes and added 1 tbsp brown sugar, I added basil, oregano, garlic powder and onion powder as well for seasoning. I poured the sauce over the chicken and sprinkled with cheese and placed back in the oven while I made pasta. We really enjoyed this variation of chicken parmesan as my son has issue with tomato based sauces and this was fine for him, it is not really saucy like others, if you like it that way maybe double or triple the sauce amounts.

Delish! The only change I made was replacing the mozzarella with herb and garlic cheddar out of necessity after discovering that my mozzarella had a lush fuzzy green sweater. It turned out pretty good! I also finished the dish in the oven for about 20 minutes after adding the cheese. Served with cappellini tossed with butter and garlic and a dusting of basil. It was our early Valentine's Day dinner!

Delicious! The chicken took a little longer than 10 minutes to cook, but I'm notoriously back at cooking any sort of meat. It still turned out perfect, even if it wasn't don't as quickly as expected!

This is an easy 4 four star.  This recipe, by what ever name would taste as good.  Substitute with supplies on hand or change amounts to suit taste or diet needs but you will still have a crispy, toasty cheese crust chicken with a rich and satisfying tomato sauce.

While I personally did not eat this (I'm a vegetarian), I made it for my boyfriend and he loved it.  He single-handedly at the entire meal!  The only change that I made was the addition of a tiny can of tomato paste, as the other reviewers had recommended this.  I will definitely make it again.  Great and easy recipe!

The chicken part is no real difference from any other all fried CP recipe.  Like others, I prefer browning and finishing in the oven for moister chicken.  If you must fry, then definately pound the chicken thin and quick fry.
The sauce (Gravy) is where this recipe falls way short.  The addition of cream has long been a staple in SanFrancisco Italian restaurants.  East coasters think they're nuts.  I like both, but you need either tomato paste or puree to attain a suitable gravy for this dish especially if served over pasta.  Also, skip the mozzerella, it's CP not CP & M!  Nothing very imaginative here.

My husband and i love it! We modified it a little, for our taste.... We drain most of the juice from the diced tomato can, (we find it gets  too liquidy) and use half a small can of tomato paste to thicken the sauce a little (we love the added flavour from it as well) and we put the chicken in a casserole in the oven with the cheese and everything on broil for a few minutes (instead of just letting the cheese melt on its own). We had people over for dinner, and it was a big hit!! We have it regularly :)

Finally a chicken parmigiana recipe that is elegant - usually they are quite oridinary and taste like commercial sauces.  Thanks for submitting - this is definitely going in my files not only for company and us too.

The chicken itself was pretty good, but I didn't like the sauce. I will still be on the look-out for another recipe.

I made this dinner for my husband and another couple, we LOVED it.  I'm sure it is not very healthy but it is YUMMY!  A nice change from the usual chix parm.

Chicken was crazy good! The sauce on the other hand, didn't look appealing, smelled weird and had very little flavor. We ended up just using a jar of sauce.

This turned out to be an exceptional dish.  A real hit with my family and in-laws.  Prep time was as stated and not difficult at all to make.

Husband loved it - went back for more.  I loved the sauce - will use it for other recipes. I would use thin breasts when making this recipe. So wonderful!

The chicken was easy and good. I suggest pounding the chicken breasts down so they cook evenly and faster. The sauce was pretty blah. Next time, I'll just used a jar of good Vodka sauce.

To me, this recipe was just.....OK.  Maybe I'm not a chicken parm. person.  My husband liked it.  It was good for a "one time" recipe.  I probably won't make this recipe again.

This was wonderful.  My 10 year old & 18 month old gobbled this up.  My husband raved about it also.  I did take advice from one review on doubling the sauce.  I used 1 can of regular diced tomatoes and 1 can of DelMonte diced tomatoes with Garlic and Olive oil.  Also I used fresh mozzerella and put it under the broiler until melted. This is a keeper.  Thank You

this was fabulous!! I added an extra can of diced tomatoes and only about 2 tbs of heavy cream.  Everyone's plate was clean as a whistle when dinner was done and hubby said this was the best dish in ages.  
Great meal!

This is a wonderful recipe, we have made this several times. I cut my chicken breast into bite size. I have also used fresh tomatoes out of our garden instead of canned.

Absolutely delicious.  I used tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes because my husband doesn't like tomatoes. It is the best I've ever had

I used chicken thighs and used 2 Tbsp whole wheat flour instead of the breadcrumbs to make it a little more low carb.  I just dipped the damp chicken in the flour mixed with cheese and oregano.  Otherwise I followed the recipe and we loved it!
