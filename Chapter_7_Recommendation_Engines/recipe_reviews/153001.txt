A little bit questionable in theory, but one of the better cocktails I've ever had.  For best results, use a fresh hot latte.  Worth a try, especially if you like coffee.

This one is sort of like a cross between a Jager Bomb and a Timmy's run (Tim Horton's for the uninformed - or Starbucks if you MUST)...  Perhaps it should be renamed the "Great White North Jager Bomb" ;);)

You have to like Jagermeister to like this hot coffee drink. With that said, I don't particularly care for it but we were gifted a bottle recently. Very similar to the drink where a shot of Jager is dropped into a glass full of Red Bull energy drink. I happen to like that one better.  Thank you for the recipe.
