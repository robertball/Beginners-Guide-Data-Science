This is a very easy and good recipe.  Everyone liked it.  I didn't have dark brown sugar so I used light brown sugar, worked just fine.  I also added 2-3 TBSP. of light corn syrup to the pecan mixture.  I've been asked to make this for two other holiday gatherings and passed on this recipe to many.

My husband took these to work along with two other kinds of cookies for Christmas.  His secretary called me the next day to say that several people were asking for this recipe.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  The texture was not what I expected, because it is not like a pecan pie, but the flavor is delicious and they are easy to cut.  I cut them into small squares, because they are rich.  They taste especially good with coffee!  I think these are now a holiday classic for us.

These were excellent. It does not have the texture of a pecan pie on top, but it has the flavors of pecan pie on top of a buttery sugar cookie crust.  Very easy to make.

DELICIOUS! Excellent recipe ... My only advice is to follow the recipe exactly. The first time i made this in a smaller baking sheet to make each bar thicker but it didn't cook right. When I tried it again i didn't try and make any adjustments it was very easy and not too time consuming ... very good recipe all in all especially with the holidays coming up :)

A very good bar cookie.  I used light brown sugar because it's what I had, and they turned out very tasty.

These are simple and oh, so good. I've made them twice now, the second time adding chocolate chips for a chocolate lover. Honestly, I think the chocolate detracts from the delicacy of the taste, but I wouldn't turn one down if offered.

Very yummy.  Not very appealing in the way of looks but defintely a keeper.  I took them to a family function and the kids were not interested in them but the adults couldn't get enough!

I followed this recipe as written but ended up with cookie bars that were dried out/overcooked.  I did use a new 9x13 pan, and it may be that I'll need to adjust cooking times when I use it.   If I make this again, I'll check the cookie base at 15 minutes, and the topping at 20.  My expectations were pretty high, so I was just a little disappointed.

Not the most spectacular looking cookie, but they are super easy to make and people really like them. Definitely a good pecan pie taste without the hassle of making the pies or some of the other bar recipes out there.

Had some trouble getting the center to set up while at the same time the edge got a bit brown. Not the prettiest cookies I've ever made, but they did taste really good. Think next time I'll put some foil around the edges about 1/2 way through cooking time to keep the edges from getting too brown and I'll cook them about 5-7 minutes longer than called for.

Maybe I'm in the minority here, but I didn't like this very much. The "cookie crust" was quite floury and, the chewy part didn't taste like pecan pie. They were alright, but the texture was way off. They were a bit dry and just kind of bland. This isn't what I was looking for in a pecan pie bar.

These are the most delicious things I have ever eaten in my entire life! They aren't much to look at, but that really doesn't matter with how fast they will disappear.  I ended up using golden brown sugar instead of dark.

I have gotten rave reviews on this and have had to hand the recipe out a few times.  When I first made it I used light brown sugar since I didn't have dark.  Everyone liked it so much this way, that I have never tried it with dark.

This was delicious.  Even the crust alone was great. I made a mistake and melted some chocolate morsels over the top when it was finished and made it extra sweet!! I was a champ and could handle it, some of my other friends, not so much ! Thanks!!

This is what happens when you don't read the instructions. I have made these as written several times. Absolutely 5 stars. Yesterday I was distracted and dumped everything in the mixer at once- oops-when I realized my mistake, I forged ahead. The ingredients were too expensive to throw away. Baked in a 9x13 pan for 30 minutes. they came out like blonde brownies. Still tasty, but not as good as  the correct recipe.

Turned out great!  Will definitely be making again.  Only suggestion would be that my husband preferred them more when they were refrigerated rather than be stored at room temperature.

Very good.  A little sweeter than I like, but everyone who tried them seemed to really enjoy them.  Easy to make, these are going into my normal baking rotation!  Hubby really liked them, and his opinion is the most important one to me!

This will become a regular in my house. I didn't have condensed milk so I substituted cream of coconut.The pan was almost empty after the four of us got through. I think I'll reduce the sugar next time as it was a bit too sweet. I can't wait to try it with condensed milk.YUMMY!

It is difficult to have a better ratio of reward vs effort in desserts. This is one of the easiest and best tasting bar recipes I have prepared.  I added a cup of Ghirardelli 60% cocao Bittersweet Chips to the wet ingredients which produced a nice combination of chocolates against the coconut pecan. Loved it.

These were soooooo... easy and yummy!  I am going to need to experiment with the appearance as they tasted much better than they looked.  Maybe placing some candied pecans on top half way through cooking?

I needed a recipe that used dark brown sugar and came across this one.  I did enjoy these bars very much. The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because i thought the crust to be a bit dry, crumbly.  When i make again, i will try cutting down on the flour by 1/2 cup.  The filling was delish.  Watch baking time. I cut back on each by 5 minutes per another review.  Hubby enjoyed them, even the edges that i cut off.

These were just ok.  I was excited to make them because a lot of reviewers were raving about them.  I guess I should have listened to the reviewer who said they don't taste anything like pecan pie.

I thought this recipe was great! I followed all of the directions to the letter the only change I made was to add a dash or 2 of cinnamon. I like the warm taste of cinnamon with pecans and brown sugar. This recipe is delicious! It is Thanksgiving today and it is a hit!
