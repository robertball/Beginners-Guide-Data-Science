Delicious and smells great.I used a little extra cumin, thyme, cilantro and all spice Next time I'll season the chicken before browning it (I abhor white chicken) and use a little more salt to bring out more flavour.

I have no experience with Indian food, so I’m not sure how it is supposed to taste. I followed the recipe exactly as written. It makes a good amount of sauce, great to go with rice. The sauce had a lot of flavor, but it is very very sweet. I’m not sure how substituting coconut milk instead of the cream would go, but that’s what I might try next time. Easy to make!
