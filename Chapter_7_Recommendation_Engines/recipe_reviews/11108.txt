When I first looked at this recipe, I thought it was too complicated.  But, they are delicious, and sort of an old-world taste.  If they seem to daunting, try halving the recipe, but try them

I found these cookies time-consuming to make.  My family didn't enjoy them at all.

This recipe was time consuming, but i  found it worth it. If you like more of an "old fashion cookie" then i think you'll enjoy them too.
