I have now made this more times than I can count!  I am always horrified by the amount of eggs and oil in these breads, so I made some easy substitutions to make it even healthier, but SHHHH, I don't tell anyone when I give it to them!  I substitute 1 cup of whole wheat flour for 1 cup of regular flour and put one of those little containers of applesauce (approx. 1/3 cup) in the 1 cup measuring cup before filling it the rest of the way up with olive oil. NO, you can't taste the difference.  I also replace the cinnamon/nutmeg mixture with 1 teaspoon EACH of pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon, and I used LIGHT coconut milk too.  Toasting the nuts and adding coconut flakes is unnecessary. ;)

Yes, this is as super moist as it says and more.  It's even moister the second day if you wrap it well in saran.  The flaked coconut is completely uneccesary, and I didn't toast the walnuts and it turned out perfectly.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves for an extra kick and using Light Coconut Milk gives the same great results.  I've made this 3 times in less than two weeks and my husband can't get enough.  Great for giving since it stays moist for so long! **2nd UPDATE** - I've substituted unsweetened applesauce for ALL of the oil and and coconut milk (which has a lot of cholestrol and fat!) and it turned out phonomenal!  The applesauce kept the bread SUPER moist and you can't taste it at all. Due to the wetness, it did take an extra 5 min. in the oven. Will never use oil/coconut milk in this  again.

I cut this recipe in half to ten servings. I had to make a couple substitutions only because I was limited in ingredients. I used pecans instead of walnuts, light brown sugar and instead of coconut milk, I used equal amounts regular milk with a teaspoon of coconut extract. I baked my muffins at 350 for exactly 20 minutes. Though they turned out moist and delicately spiced, these were a little too sweet. The coconut flavor with the pumpkin was different but in a good way.

The first time I made this, it was good, but seemed to lack flavor.  So the second  time, I added 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves and it really made a difference.  This bread comes out very moist and both vegans and non-vegans have loved it!

yummmmmmmm!  This is a great treat for kids, my 8 month-old and my 2 year-old both love it.  I make muffins and bake them @ 350 for about 22 minutes (give or take a minute)  I also changed the recipe to accomidate using 1 15oz can of pumpkin.  I use 3 1/4 cups flour and I add a tablespoon of applesauce.  I have tried using less oil, and it dosen't come out right - stick to the 1 cup.  I also adjusted the sugar to 1 1/2 cups brown and 1/2 cup white.  I've tried using even less but they then taste a bit too bitter for us.

I made many changes, but this turned into a fabulous (and healthier) bread:

-subbed 2 c. whole wheat flour
-subbed 1/2 c. applesauce for 1/2 oil
-used light coconut milk
-omitted white sugar!  (Trust me--this bread is so sweet, you won't even notice)
-increased spices by adding a little extra cinnamon, 1/2 t. cloves, and 1/2 t. ginger
-omitted flake coconut.
-increased nuts to 1 1/2 c.

With all these changes, this was the most satisfying pumpkin bread I’ve ever eaten, vegan or not.  Baking time was exact—they were perfect after 1 hr. 15 min.  My kids loved it, and I will make it over and over again! I'll also try this recipe for banana and zucchini bread...

This was the best bread!  I did not have flaked coconut on hand so I omitted it.  Instead of walnuts I added almonds (not toasted) cut in half and fold it it into the batter.  They tasted wonderful!  Also, I made pumpkin fudge which never set so I just melted that down and used it as a glaze on top of the bread.  This bread is moist and flavourful!  A hit with my husband and 16 month old.  It only took 45 minutes to cook,  if I had left it in the whole cooking time it would have burned.  Yummy!!

Wonderful bread. I made a pumpkin bread recipe the other day and incorporated from that 1/2 tsp. Allspice and 1/4 tsp. cloves to give this one a little more kick. Smelled wonderful baking and tasted great too. Mad a spread with cream cheese, honey and cinnamon to spread on this.

I made this for the first time last night, and we ate the first loaf in less than a day.  Wowsers!  My apartment still smells fragrant.  I skipped the shredded coconut and the walnuts, and am perfectly happy with the result.  Thanks for the recipe!

This tastes GREAT!  I cut the recipe in half and made 12 cupcake sized muffins.  They turned out perfect.  I also substituted applesauce for 3/4 of the oil, and omitted the shredded coconut.  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.  I highly recommend it.

THIS IS GOOD
i am sitting here, actually PROUD of myself for having made the best tasting thing I have ever made in my life.  This recipe is amazing and it is super super moist.  I left mine in just a little longer and the top if wonderfully crunchy and the inside is just luscious.  

I absolutely recommend this recipe, unless you are looking for a more traditional pumpkin bread loaf.

This recipe made has the most moist texture I've ever made that didn't come from a box!  I found that 1 hour baking time was perfect (could just be my oven).  Also you could add more spice if you wanted.  The coconut milk made all the difference.  THANK YOU!!!!!

Being that I'm a total meativore, I have never attempted vegan cooking before. However, one of the couples we frequently host dinner parties with are vegans and I wanted to cook for the group without making them feel like they couldn't eat anything. I made vegan chili, vegan cornbread, and this. All three dishes turned out amazing, but this was the crowning glory. The lack of proccessed "fake" ingrediants so common to vegan dishes really made this dish. It was a total hit with my friends and at work the next day. It makes a great breakfast snack or dinner dessert. My non vegan friends loved it with cream cheese icing. I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp of ground cloves. Next time I will try shredding the coconut better and subbing applesauce for half of the oil.

I didn't care for the taste of this bread, and it especially wasn't worth all the extra fat and calories from that much oil and coconut milk.  I was disappointed because it didn't seem like the pumpkin was spiced enough and the bread itself had a strange aftertaste to me.  I have a whole bunch of it now and I have no idea what to do with it!

As I only have one loaf pan and didn't want to bother with halving the recipe, I can say it turned out beautifully when done in a 9x13 baking dish.  An excellent recipe for vegan families (just substitute the white and brown sugar with rapadura and a little molasses) or family members with dairy allergies.

This is a very good vegan pumpkin bread.  I have had trouble converting my pumpkin-based baked goods to vegan recipes that will still please my husband, but these did the trick. They have an ultra-creamy texture reminiscent of coconut milk ice cream, and a nice fall flavor with no artificial ick aftertaste like so many vegan products. 

The changes I made: used half a cup of oil and increased pumpkin to three cups. Severely cut down sugar: half a cup of dark brown and about a third of a cup of white, but I did add bakers chocolate chunks instead of nuts. There is no need for all that oil or sugar! Doubled the spices and added a heaping tsp of powdered Ginger as well as 1/2 tsp ground cloves. Overall result very good, will make again!

I was skeptical initially because there are no eggs in this recipe, but this bread is wonderful.  Each time I've made it I ommitted the walnuts and shreddd coconut and it still turned out GREAT.  Incredibly moist - the best I've had.

I baked this bread and it was good. I dont agree on the baking time though. The bread needs to be in the oven 55-60 minutes. The bread will be moist if done this way. Proper preheating time needs to be taken into account also. If left longer, the bread will start to harden no matter if you cover with foil.

Very moist & flavorful.  I followed another reivewers recommendation and subbed apple sauce for 1/2 of the oil, and added 1/2 tsp allspice & 1/4 tsp cloves.  It was a little on the sweet side though, so I think I will use less sugar next time.

these were a huge hit! and honestly, they got better as the days went by. i made a large batch so they lasted almost a week. everyone loved them.  i tweaked the recipe just a tad. i didn't use the toasted nuts because we're not huge nut fans, and i skipped on the coconut flakes, because i really just wanted to have pumpkin bread. i substituted applesauce for the oil and coconut milk, and i used 1/3c splenda and 1/3c white sugar [i wanted to give some to my parents that they could enjoy guilt free].  also, i made muffins instead of loafs. cooked on the same heat setting but for only 22 mins. they came out incredibly moist!

Pumpkin bread is one of my favorite seasonal foods of all time. And this recipe knocks it out of the park. You can omit the coconut flakes if you so desire, and this recipe can really be a canvas for whatever you're in the mood for. Add in some chopped walnuts/pecans? Sure! Cover with a cream cheese icing? Absolutely! You can really go crazy using this bread mix as a base. Excellent recipe.

I swapped in 1 cp whole wheat flour, used 1 1/2 c. brown sugar, no white sugar, 3/4 c applesauce and 1/4 c oil for the oil and added 1 tsp Chinese 5 spice powder.  It was great-- very moist and flavorful

Delicious! Because I was missing some ingredients, I used regular milk (instead of coconut milk), and I didn't add the flaked coconut, or the nuts. It still turned out great! A bit on the sweet side, so maybe I could also cut back on sugar next time! Thank you for the recipe!

Yummy! But this is definitely not meant as a healthy vegan treat. I substituted 1 cup of flour for whole wheat flour with no discernible difference, probably because all the sugar covered it up.  Next time I will make it healthier. I'll use 1.5 cups whole wheat flour, sub half the oil for applesauce and not even add the white sugar, or at least reduce it by half. Needless to say, though, the kids loved it and my neighbor wants the recipe.

I first made this bread about three years ago for Thanksgiving as my SIL couldn't have any dairy or eggs.  I'm so glad I tried it.  Its become my favorite.  I also add extra spices and some cloves and substitute a third of the oil for applesauce.  I've never added the shredded coconut as most of the family doesnt like it.  I like to make a glaze with some of the leftover coconut milk.  I take the coconut milk and mix it up with powdered sugar and maple flavoring and drizzle it all over the top while the bread is still warm so it seeps into the bread.  I then like to freeze the bread for at least a day.  Once thawed it seems to be extra moist.  I've got a couple of pumpkin bread recipes and I always come back to making this one, give it a try :-)

update: I have to give this 5 stars...I'm making yet again, this time made muffins and sprinkled the tops with raw sugar.  The texture is perfect!  I did half oil, half applesauce this time and they came out very moist but not too dense.  And, as an added bonus, enjoy eating the batter, its delicious and no raw egg to worry about!

The coconut lovers in my family really liked this - and they are not big pumpkin bread fans.  I liked it, but prefer the traditional route.  Still, I'll make it again for others in the family.

I was looking for some way to use up extra coconut milk, and this recipe popped up.  I decided to make it in LARGE muffin papers(like Costco sized muffins).  I didn't have the walnuts, but after putting 1/2 C. batter in each muffin paper, I topped each with a sprinkle of chopped up white chocolate that I had leftover from dipping candies.  WOWIE!  SOOO amazingly delicious!  I baked the large muffins on 350 for 30 minutes.  Very nice if you're out of eggs, too!  Next time, I will substitute applesauce for the oil, just to try that out for a low fat option.

Delicious!! Made this twice already, the first time I made the recipe (but without walnuts because I am allergic) and it was amazing. The second time I made it, I altered the recipe a bit and it came out just as good but  a lot healthier. I halved both sugars, doubled both spices, and put in 1/2 cup extra pumpkin instead of half of the oil. It was even moister and a lot healthier!

This was very tasty. The first pumpkin bread I've ever made. I baked it so I could send it as a treat for a vegan friend who's going on a long car trip.   I halved the recipe and used a heaping teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice instead of the spices.   I added 1/4 teaspoon of lemon extract and a teaspoon or two of molassas for added flavor since some reviews said it was only so so. I omitted the nuts and coconut shreds because I didn't have any on hand at the time. I'd like to try this again with dried apricots, cherries or cranberries and pecans.  I used about half the required amount of sugar and it turned out fine, plenty sweet enough but not too sweet.   Since it was only 1 loaf it was ready a bit earlier than the recipe indicated. I covered it with foil and took it out about 15 minutes early.   I bet this could make a lovely Harvest French Toast for a special autumn brunch.

I made this recipe into 12 jumbo size muffin.  I also changed a few ingredients.  Cutted the oil by half and substitute 1/2 cup apple butter and 1/2 cup oil.  Omitted coconut milk for 1 cup enriched soymilk.  Also, omitted coconut flake and substitute it with 1 cup raisins.  I didn't have any nuts on hand so i substitute the nuts with 1 1/2 cup of multi-grain (oats, barely, and rye).  Last but not least, I instead of what the recipe called for i used 2 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon, 1 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp cloves.  The pumpkin muffin came out moist and delicious, even the next day it was still moist.  I would definitely make this again, but this time with nuts and dried cranberries.

I made a few substitutions -
I did 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1.5 cups white flour INSTEAD of 3.5 cups of white flour.
I used 1 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup white, instead of the really high amounts the recipe calls for.
I did 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup applesauce instead of 1 cup of oil....ew.
I didn't add coconut flakes
I added 1/2 tablespoon of ginger and the tiniest pinch of clove...

I made them as muffins, baked them at 350 for 30 minutes. They are PERFECT. They're moist, not too sweet but sweet enough, and with the walnuts, whole wheat, and half the sugar, I don't feel bad feeding them to people as breakfast.

This was not my favorite of the pumpkin breads on this site.  I found it rather heavy, and in need of more salt.  I hate to change a recipe, then rate it.  If I were to add more salt, maybe it would be a 5.

Nice and moist but not super flavorful. I also wanted more of a coconut taste. I will probably stick with my old pumpkin bread recipe from this site.

Very good! I used 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup ground flax seed, and 1.5 cups white flour. I cut the total amount of sugar in half.  I used lite coconut milk.  It was very moist and tasty!

I give this recipe 5-stars because it is a successful, tasty, moist vegan bread. If I were to put next to a non-vegan option I would score it a little lower, because the crust is kinda chewy. But, for being a vegan recipe this is GREAT!

Very, very good!  I needed to use up an open can of coconut milk, and I am glad I found this recipe!  It is super moist. I left out the 2/3 cup white sugar, and didn't have nuts or flaked coconut.   Next time, I will add more spices.

excellent. went over so well for thanksgiving. i subbed applesauce for the oil and coconut milk.  i omitted the coconut flakes and walnuts.  next time i think i'll add raisins, it seemed like it was missing that taste.  really good, really easy, fantastic base recipe.  will use again and again.

Very moist, very tasty pumpkin bread.  I loved the addition of coconut milk but did not put additional coconut.  It was gone so quickly.  With my extra coconut milk I made another batch of this bread!

This was sooooo good! Great spiced flavor & super moist, just like it says! My vegan brother loved it as well. Be careful on the baking time, tho. It took less than 1 hr, even w/2 loaves. If I hadn't checked them they would have burned. Oh, in case you have trouble finding coconut milk at the store, it's in a can, in the chinese food section. It took me awhile to find it. :)

I halved this recipe, added 1/2 tsp of cloves, and substituted applesauce for 1/2 the oil called for, then baked it for 45 minutes in a 9x9 pan. It is absolutely scrumptious and could pass for cake!   I bet this would be even more special with a simple vanilla glaze. Yum.

Soooo good!! I went ahead and added 2 eggs and didn't add the nuts or flaked coconut. They are so moist. I'm going to add mini loaves to Christmas goodie baskets and hand them out to neighbors.

This is a fabulous recipe to which I only made a few minor revisions based on the recommendation of others.  I, too, substituted 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil for the 1 cup of oil.  I also used 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice to the mix.  The best part was that I used organic shredded coconut from Whole Foods and it is finely shredded and unsweetened and the perfect addition to the recipe.  I think it would change the consistency to use regular shredded coconut so if you can find unsweetened shredded coconut, use it.  The bread smelled wonderful baking and I made one loaf and one 8x8 pan and only needed to bake them for 50 minutes.  When I made 6 mini-loaves, I baked them for 30 minutes.  I brought this to Thanksgiving dinner and was shocked when a picky eater of the kid variety bypassed everything on the table and went straight for the pumpkin bread and even ate two slices.  My kids love it and I have even made small muffins to tuck into lunches.  YUMMY!

This is the best pumpkin bread I have ever had in my life!!  Sorry, Mom!  I am not a fan of eggs in baked goodies and decided to try it.  The simple ingredients are usually staples in my cupboard and can be made anytime.  I topped the loaf with sweetened shredded coconut.  Delicious!  I only wonder of the other mix-ins that would make this even better (cranberries, golden raisins, pumpkin seed meats, etc.)

Additional note to my previous review: I used coconut milk, not coconut water. Coconut milk contains coconut water and coconut cream. It tends to separate in the can, so you must mix the two.

If you are looking a moist pumpkin bread recipe, this is NOT it.  I Made this yesterday and I especially made it because of the title of the recipe...super moist pumpkin bread.  I'm still trying to find what part of the loaf is moist.  Followed the recipe to a T...I wasted my money here on this recipe.  Had to give it the one star...had no choice.

If you are looking a moist pumpkin bread recipe, this is NOT it.  I Made this yesterday and I especially made it because of the title of the recipe...super moist pumpkin bread.  I'm still trying to find what part of the loaf is moist.  Followed the recipe to a T...I wasted my money here on this recipe.  Had to give it the one star...had no choice.

Easy, moist and a family-pleaser! I must say I would have used 3 pans for this recipe, which I followed exactly because my pans overflowed. I would have been just as happy with 3 shorter loaves and next time that is the way I will make it.

Great bread! Had no coconut milk or milk substitute so was forced to use plain old water and it turned out fine! Also sub'd half of oil for applesauce. Muffins turned out good as well.

I didn't  change the recipe except for substituting toasted pecans instead of walnuts and it was perfect for my taste. I made mini loaves and muffins and not only did they taste terrific, they  presented beautifully (I forgot to take pics, but will try to remember next time). Very filling without being too heavy. I believe a quality pumpkin puree and the coconut milk are essential too an above average result. Thanks for sharing.

Followed the recipe to the letter and it just didn't work out well at all.  Sure, it was super moist...almost too moist.  I let it cool overnight and when i cut it the next day the loaf just fell apart.  It tasted OK, nothing spectacular.  I've definitely had better pumpkin bread than this.

Turned out great.  Made a couple minor substitutions - was short on oil, so I used half applesauce, half oil.  Had just a half cup of coconut milk; used some extra flaked coconut instead.  Also added extra cloves and allspice, per others' suggestions.  Definitely a keeper - and not just for a "vegan" recipe - I'm not vegan; it's a great recipe by any standard.

Absolutely incredible. As other posters have mentioned the coconut doesn't create a strong taste but does wonders for the texture! I used three cups of white rice flour and a half cup of flax. I used a half stick of smart balance butter blend. Otherwise I followed it faithfully. I cannot imagine anything more delicious!! The texture and moistness alone are to die for. I made one large loaf and then two mini loafs for gifts. This is going to be my go-to recipe for Christmas gifts!

This is the best recipe!  I have made this many, many times and have always received rave reviews - if you're a fan of pumpkin bread, you have to try this!  I have made a few changes to make it healthier and which don't seem to effect the taste: - Use less oil (maybe 2/3 cup) and use the entire 14 oz can of coconut milk - even light coconut milk works.  I also increased the amount of pumpkin by about 1/2 cup and used half real sugar and half sweetener.  Also, make sure to use unsweetened coconut, otherwise the bread will come out way too sweet.  Unsweetened coconut can be hard to find, but you can usually find it at Whole Foods or other natural food stores.  If you can't find unsweetened, I'm pretty sure you can reduce the amount of sugar to compensate. Make this recipe!  I guarantee you will love it.

One word.... WOW!  Made 3 minor changes to bring this into line with what I try to do with all recipes in our home... subbed both sugars with Splenda Baking Blend/Splenda Brown Sugar Blend and reduced coconut by 1/2.  This small changed saved us 20 gms in carbs... will definitely be making this for a treat during the holidays!  Thank you for sharing!

I give this 3 stars, it kind of grows on you. I did mini loafs, cook time differs, but no eggs "whats that about" is that a mistake? You can tell when you taste it somethings missing, but like I said, it grows on you by bite 3.  Now I have all these loafs and trying to think who I can give them to. Would like feed back on this, or is it just me. "NO EGGS"????

Very forgiving recipe.  Used coconut coffee creamer instead of milk, but accidentally added 1 c. instead of 2/3!  Used 1/3 c. applesauce, and 1/3 c. olive oil, still came out great!  Makes awesome muffins.

This is a great recipe, my husband almost ate one whole loaf in one sitting! I changed a few things to lower fat/cals and it was still SO moist and tasty. Used light coconut milk, subed olive oil for veg oil and actually used less than 1 cup, made it up with the coconut milk. I'm not a fan of nuts in bread, so left those out. Didn't have coconut and was still DELISH without. A+!

My family loves this bread. I had to make a couple of changes due to what i had available at the time. I used light brown sugar instead of dark, and only used 1/3 cup of white sugar. I did not have the spices but i did have pumpkin pie spice and so i used 2 rounded tsp.. I also did not have any coconut but i always have coconut milk and it did call for that yeah! No nuts though. This was the most delicious sweet bread I have ever tasted. It oddly enough has a bit of a chocolate hint to the taste. I can't make it often, the stuff becomes addicting! Love it!

soooo moist and delicious!!! I used Libby's Canned Pumpkin Pie Mix for the puree, the 30 oz can yields about 2 1/2 cps of puree, so I had to make some conversions on the ingredients. I also substituted most of the oil with applesauce and did not add coconut flakes, (personal preference).  I used six, small foil bread pans (don't know the size) and a regular sized bread pan (for my house). I shared them at two different Halloween parties last night, my daughters' house and brother/sister-in-laws home.  They all loved it. My daughter even called me this morning just to tell me the bread was an A+. (I've been making recipes from this website lately and her family are my taste testers, tee hee). MAHALO!!! This is a great recipe and I'll definitely be making this often.

This is delicious.  :)  I added 1 tsp of ginger and some chocolate chips and cranberries.  I could have done without the cranberries, but the chocolate chips make it extra good!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very yummy...I even made this wheat-free! (spelt,rice and a gluten-free allpurpose mix) Should check loaves after about an hour as mine were done then.  I may reduce sugar a bit next time too, as a little sweet for my taste.

this bread is delicious! very moist and flavorful. i made a few small changes by using all brown sugar and leaving out the flaked coconut. i also added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon allspice because i had them on hand, but i'm sure the recipe is fine as is. i will definitely make this again. i recommend it!

I used 1/2 cup of applesauce, 1/2 cup of canola oil & I added a tsp of vanilla. Forgot to decrease my sugar some for my sweetened coconut so I cut back on the coconut. I wish I had put it through teh food processor to shred it up more. I used pecans for walnuts because that's what I had & I used 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon & nutmeg. I made 4 half loafs & 2 tiny loafs (for my grandsons). I baked @ 325 for 30 minutes on the mini-loaves & baked the half loaves for 50. This was very good! Because this stays so moist I am mailing a loaf to my Dad...it should still be perfect when it reaches him a couple of days from now.  Thansk Kevin!

I skipped the nuts, however this recipe "rocks"!  It is so moist and friends who do not like coconut (can you imagine) loved it and begged for more.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Great bread, though I did add extra spices as I love cinnamon and cloves, nutmeg also.  I added 3 eggs because I can't seem to bake anything without them.

great vegan treat!  very yummy although you have to beware and bake it in the 8 inch pan not a 9 inch or it really doesn't come out right.  I made the batch with 2 different sized pans because that was what I had available and the 9 inch cooked wrong.  I brought it to work and it was a great treat!

This was wonderful!  I made it as muffins instead of as bread and added a simple cream cheese filling.  Also, I didn't use walnuts because I didn't have any.  Try this recipe; you will never look for another pumpkin bread recipe again!

when this website was down, I had to try another "deluxe" pumpkin bread, which turned out like cardboard.  being health conscious, I make this one with 2/3 whole wheat flour, no white sugar, and only about 1.5 C brown sugar.  they are great and freeze well.

Loved this recipe! Based on other reviewers, I swapped out the oil and coconut milk for equal parts unsweetened applesauce sauce. Also used 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin spice instead of the cinnamon and nutmeg as specified. I forewent the coconut and walnuts by family request :)
This is my new pumpkin bread go-to!

I only changed the walnuts to pecans because that is what I had on hand.  The bread is moist, not too sweet and very delicious. I was unsure about putting coconut in it, but it was fantastic. I will definitely make this again.

Holds up to its name "super moist pumpkin bread." I've tried several other recipes and this one is the most moist. I don't understand why more people don't like coconut. You hardly notice the flakes or flavor of coconut, but I think that just might be the secret to how this loaf is so moist. It used two cans of pumpkin on accident! Oops! But I love the density with the two cans. I added dried cherries (I'd use craisins too if I had them). Put the walnuts on top - I have a baby whom I wanted to give some to and on top you can avoid them. 4 year old and 7 month old LOVE this recipe. I will make again and omit the white sugar. It was just a tad too sweet, but I don't like really sweet. 5 stars for the next time I make it with no white sugar.

This is really good! I was so surprised to see there was no egg in this recipe! I was concerned that the bread wouldn't hold together...it's perfect! Beautiful texture! I used regular milk in place of coconut, all I had to season with was cinnamon! So I used 3 heaping teaspoons of cinnamon. Really good! I also used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour. I ended up with one loaf and then some muffins (maybe 6 or 9 -- can't remember). The first day I thought it was okay...but after a couple days it just goes to whole another level. Oh, I should mention I didn't use any flake coconut and I didn't toast my walnuts either, I simply mixed them in the batter. I iced it once it cooled ( 1 cup of powdered sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of maple extract, and a tbsp of milk and plus a tiny bit more to thin it out, just a tad). I just drizzled it over the top and it's beautiful!! I orginally threw the recipe away, thinking it was just okay. I'm back to get the recipe and save it this time!

Outstanding. Used original recipe first time and loved it.  Second time I substituted unsweetened applesauce for oil and still loved it. Third time I substituted mashed sweet potatoes for the pumpkin and still loved it.  Our guests have enjoyed it, too!

This bread turned out perfectly. I didn't use the coconut or the nuts and used skim milk in place of the coconut milk. All other ingredients I kept the same. The bread has a perfect quick bread texture, is moist but not soggy or falling apart and has the perfect sweetness. I think by omitting the coconut and substituting  skim milk for the coconut milk helped to lower the sweetness because I noticed some reviews saying this was too sweet. It was no longer super sweet by taking out the coconut ingredients. I put the batter in 10 tiny loaf pans and baked them for 25-30 mins at 350 degrees and they came out perfect.  Will use this recipe from now on. Love the fact it doesn't have eggs because I have an egg allergy.  I'm always looking for tasty no-egg recipes and this one is so good and doesn't taste like anything was left out. Try this one you'll love it too.

This is my favourite pumpkin loaf recipe of all time.  I've been making it for a few years and it always tastes amazing!  It is vegan so I can give it to my friends who are vegan but the ones who aren't have no clue it's free of eggs and dairy and love it just the same.  This loaf is always stays moist for days and freezes well.  I've made it as muffins and mini loaves, too, just adjusted the baking time.  No need to make any substitutions ingredient wise - it works the way it is!  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

Delicious! I altered the recipe a bit to make it healthier and added a few extra spices based on other reviews. Replaced the coconut oil with unsweetened applesauce, same measurement. Omitted the white sugar completely. Added a teaspoon ground cloves and a half a teaspoon ground ginger (the ginger seems to be optional, the cloves are important). It comes out perfect and just the right amount of sweet! And I don't feel guilty for eating too much of it. My coworkers devoured it today so I had to come home and make some more. Success!

Fantastic recipe! I only had 1 cup of brown sugar, so I substituted a cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup molasses for the second cup. Instead of loaves, I made 17 jumbo muffins, which were done in 28 minutes in my convection oven. They smelled heavenly while baking, and came out super moist and delicious. I'm a coconut-freak, and I love the unusual pumpkin-coconut combination. I'm sure I'll make this recipe often; it's a definite keeper!

I made half a recipe of this cake. It turned out very well (see the photos). I put the nuts on top instead of inside the cake just for decorative purpose. The nuts enhanced the flavor of the cake.

It was a bit too spicy to my liking but my husband loved it. He said it would be better if I reduce the coconut but I thought the coconut gave a good texture and flavor to it. 

I can confirm that this recipe works. I followed all the measurement except the white sugar which I skipped. It was sweet enough and very moist.

Used a 9x13 baking dish to make it as I only have one loaf pan. I removed the nuts and coconut and took it out seven minutes early but the sides were still overcooked. However, I live in an "almost high elevation" city where most recipes require no change but some cakes and breads do. Not sure if it was the pan, elevation, or recipe. Gonna try it again but adjust it to high elevation.

I've experimented with several
pumpkin breads, and I have finally found the one. This is easier and since my son has an egg and dairy allergy, this one works great! I followed directions exactly except for adding the coconut flakes and nuts. 
It was very moist inside with a very slight crunch outside. Just perfect!

I made some changes, because the amount of sugar and oil seemed way too high for my taste: I used 1/4 cup of oil instead of 1 (!) cup. I kept the 2 cups of brown sugar but omitted the white sugar. I also added nutmeg, cloves, a generous amount of cinnamon, and 1 tsp of real vanilla. I did not use the coconut flakes, because of the spices I wanted to use. Finally, I used the one tsp of baking soda but also 2 tsp of baking powder. I mixed the sugar with the liquid stuff and the pumpkin first until disolved. Then I combined the dry stuff aside and folded it in at the end. I put the batter in a cake pan and sprinkled it with 1/4 cup of vegan dark chocolate chips before baking it for 28 min. DELICIOUS!!!!

I am rating it 5* because I made this without the walnuts and coconut (my own fault) and have to say it definitely needs those.  Without it, the bread is still good, but it lacks texture, and some may find it even too moist or gummy.  

I, like others, would definitely recommend using much more spices (up to twice as much as the recipe calls for), or you might find it too bland/simple.

Made the recipe with 2 cups of whole wheat flour, half of the sugars and no nuts. I decided to make muffins because they're easier to send in lunches! Smells awesome.. They look good.. be back in 5 to tell you how they taste! Mmmm they're good! They could use more spices or sugar but really good.. :D

Great bread!  Super moist and easy to bake.  I don't usually like pumpkin bread, but this is perfect because the pumpkin flavor isn't overwhelming.  I followed the recipe exactly minus the walnuts (allergy).  I will make this again.

The best! And it's vegan to boot! I add about 1 tsp of cloves and some pumpkin pie spice to kick up the flavor. I haven't added the coconut or walnuts and don't miss them (though I may try w/ coconut next time).

This bread, which I made in the form of muffins, turned out beautifully! I have fed it to many friends and family and everyone loves it. I substituted applesauce for the vegetable oil, as I always do in baking. I also left out the coconut flakes and added in some clove, which I think really made a big difference. I froze the majority of muffins and take a few out a week. Makes this delicious treat last!

This recipe is amazing. I gave the two loaves to my boyfriend to take to work and by lunch time I received an empty pan!! I had a sliver the night before and it was truly moist. I ommitted the nuts and the coconut flakes (not a fan of either ingredient) and the bread was absolutely delicious. This is a keeper!!

This is a really good recipe and it is very moist! The other comments helped me. I only baked it for 1 hour which still seemed a tiny bit too long. I might try this again cooking it a little less and not putting coconut in it. It was not needed at all!

Yum! This was as moist and dense as advertised. I didn't even realise it was a vegan recipe until I had made the dough/batter and checked and double-checked that there were no eggs! It turned out very nicely regardless! I used Splenda instead of the white sugar and applesauce instead of the oil and was very happy I did. Not only was it a super tasty bread, but I felt pretty good about eating it too! All of the party-goers at our Halloween pumpkin-themed party also really enjoyed it!

Very good.  Used olive oil as recommended and it did work well.  Didn't use flaked coconut or roast the nuts...still was excellent.

Definitely very moist - a little too much coconut for me - and I LOVE coconut!  But nobody in MY family is complaining!  I think I will try vanilla pudding next time.

This is DIVINE!  It is soooo moist.  I made an executive decision to substitute some raisins for the coconut.  This one is a keeper.  My oven cooked it in 1 hour.  Guess different ovens maintain their heat in varying ways.....pay attention toward the end of the hour.  It would be a shame to burn this luscious stuff!

I made it without the almonds and flaked coconut, otherwise kept it the same.  I made 1/2 into muffins, 1/2 into bread.  The muffins are very addicting.  Muffins took 22 minutes to cook, bread took 58 min in an 8 inch cake pan.  Next time I'll try the low-fat versions people have posted.  This is about as good as pumpkin bread gets.

We loved this bread.  I added raisins to one loaf...not so good, but ok.  We didn't like the coconut in it that much either, but it was ok.  The bread-bread part of it was excellent!  Very moist and yummy!

Awesome! It tastes great, is truly super-moist and uses some good ingredients.  Coconut milk is great for your body as is pumpkin(superfood!).  I sprinkled shredded coconut on top and it made a sweet, crispy crust on top.

I didn't have any cocount milk on hand so I decided to try just regular milk and it worked! When warm, the bread did cruble a bit when sliced,  but I served it with dinner, and it was devoured. The next day the second loaf was moist and delicious and not at all crumbly.
 Best pumpkin bread I've ever tasted!

I omitted the nuts and coconut, halved the recipe, added 1/2 tsp each of cloves and cardamom, and made muffins instead of loaves and they came out amazing! I made them for my vegan friend and all the rest of my classmates and EVERYONE loved them!

Considering we made a number of changes, this was pretty good!  We used 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and then a mixture of all purpose flour and whole grain pastry flour for the other 3 1/4 cups.  We tried using only one cup of brown sugar, as my regular pumpkin bread recipe calls for, but it just didn't work because this makes SO much batter.  We added in another cup of white sugar, and that was enough (so we left out 2/3 c sugar).  Instead of oil we used two cups of applesauce per another reviewer's suggestion, and the bread was still very moist of course, but I'm sure that it's a different texture than if its made with oil.  We'll probably keep messing with the recipe and also try others, but I think this one is certainly worth a try whether you follow the recipe to a T or make some changes.  Thanks!

Way to sweet. I was looking for a pumpkin bread and got a dense pumpkin cake. After tasting it the people at the party thought it was a cake.They really liked it, but I am not a fan of so much sugar. At least not in my bread. I may try it again since it has no cholesterol but with a lot less sugar.Maybe just half of the recomended amount.

This is probably among the best pumpkin bread recipes out there.  Next time I won't add the shredded coconut.  It interferes with the texture and adds to the already heavy sweetness.  Definitely be generous with the spices - I tripled the amount of spices and I feel like it could've used more!  Just remember this is a dense bread best baked in a loaf pan.  Do not expect a cakey texture.

came out perfectly.
It didn't take as long to bake as stated in the recipe, so be sure to check on it often!

This was great, I left out the nuts because I didn't have any on hand.  I also used pumpkin pie filling so it was really sweet like cake.  The coconut gives it that something special.

This is amazing. I added a tiny amount of cloves and ginger and left out the flaked coconut and walnuts. SO moist. This is definitely replacing my current pumpkin bread recipe. Thanks much!

Loved it!  The texture is perfect, the flavor is subtle and complex, the recipe is easy to follow.

I used fresh pumpkin puree and followed some of the suggestions here for a healthier version, and yes, it tasted terrific.

Skipped the nuts and coconut, added 1/2 t. each of cloves, ginger, and 1 t. each of nutmeg and cinnamon.  

Baked in two disposable loaf pans of recommended size.  If you fill them too full, the bread will not bake in the time prescribed here, so I took the fully baked loaf out, turned off the oven and left the gooey loaf in the oven until the oven completely cooled.  The loaf was perfectly baked throughout.

This was good but could be better. I made it exactly true to the recipe, but felt afterwards, I probably could have gotten away with putting all the dough in one bread pan. One was slightly smaller that the other, and was too done after having removed it from the oven early. I would definitely check it every so often because the second one came out great and I took it out about 25 minutes earlier than it said to. The second one was really moist and tasty... If you can't find the coconut milk, go to the alcohol section of the grocery where they have the mixers. I thought it was a strange place to have it and it took me forever to find.

This recipe is addicting. :) I've made it at least once a week since I found it. My family and I all love it! 
However, to make myself feel OK about eating that much of it, I cut out the white sugar entirely (reduces to only 2 cups sugar), replace 1/3 of the oil with apple sauce, plus I use coconut oil. I like to make it extra spicey, too, and it's good with dried cranberries!!
This one's a keeper. :)

I quartered the recipe (I have a tiny toaster oven) and subbed soy nog for the coconut milk, oatmeal instead of coconut, and used fresh roasted buttercup squash. It made 6 dense and very moist muffins, probably because there is no baking powder. Still delicious though.

Finally, an outstanding vegan recipe that absolutely no one would know is vegan. I made the following changes:
Used one 9 inch pan, used 2 cups of packed dark brown sugar and no white sugar, used 1 cup of natural apple sauce and no oil, added lots of spice: heaping amounts of allspice, ground cloves, cinammon, and nutmeg plus about a teaspoon and a half of vanilla. I forgot to put the walnuts in so I roasted them and sprinkled them on top. I also omitted the coconut flakes and used a low fat coconut milk. This is an excellent recipe and probably would still be perfect if you made it as listed.

I made this recipe to bring to a potluck and it disappeared almost before I could set it on the table!  Delicious!

I made these into muffins. Half of the recipe I added oats to it and liked that half better. I found the muffins to be a bit dry. Wasn't my favorite recipe.

FABULOUS!  Best bread I've ever made with pumpkin!  People can't leave it alone.  The second time I made it I subsituted apple sauce (non sugared) for half the fat and it was even better.  Absolutely delicious!

The bread turned out great. It was very moist and delicious. This was my first time making bread and I am glad that I tried this recipe.I made 6 loaves to give away for the holiday. I used pecans instead of walnuts. This is a definite must try recipe.

I replaced 1-1/2 c. of the all purpose flour with whole wheat flour, and replaced the raisins with dates.  It was easy and turned out moist and delicious.  A powdered sugar glaze made it look even better and helped keep in the moisture.

This is the best "quick bread" I have ever had. I also did not add the flaked coconut and it was terrific.  When I filled the pans with the batter they were 2/3 full and I really thought it would overflow but there was no problem at all.  TERRIFIC RECIPE!!!

I wasn't expecting to make a vegan recipe when searching for something to do with my left over pumpkin but I decided to give this one a try since I had so much extra and was pleasantly surprised and how well this turned out. Even brought a loaf to work to share and it was devoured. So popular I made it again 2 days later.

I made it three times in a week to the delight of my family and neighbors.  The third time I added about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips (no more), which were well-received.  I forgot the coconut flakes and it was still amazing and moist.

I have made this recipe many times and my family absolutely loves it.  I bake it 3 days in advance to when I need it and wrap it tightly in glad wrap.  On that third day when it is unwrapped the crust is super moist and delicious.

So I made this with GLUTEN-FREE flour. I substituted 1/2 cup applesauce with 1/2 oil for the 1 cup oil.  I went skimpy on the brown sugar since I didn't have as much as it called for.  I used almond milk instead of coconut milk, and it's quite sweet without coconut milk. If you're going gluten free, I recommend Bob's Red Mill all-purpose flower mix. WATCH your time - my loaves were done, using a convection over, at 50, not 75 minutes.  Gluten-free flour was probably the reason for that.  As others have said, plenty sweet, no coconuts for me.

I read several reviews prior to selecting this recipe and the very first one mentioned ‘all those eggs..’. There are no eggs listed in the ingredients!  Got me thinking I should probably add some.  I doubled the recipe  to make two loaves, I added 2 eggs. 
It was awesome!  That 1 hour and 15 minute cook time was spot on. Delish and evenly cooked. Love it.

I followed the recipe. Yes, the bread is moist and it looks great but it doesn't taste like pumpkin to me. Will adjust the spices slightly and try again.

I did make some changes suggested by other reviewers but nothing major.  The bread has a great flavor and is very moist.  I would love for someone to tell me how to tightly wrap foil on a pan that has just come out of a 350* oven.

I have tried a lot of pumpkin bread recipes but, this is the best by far!  I followed recipe with just a few substitutions. I used 2/3 cup of sweetened condensed milk instead of coconut milk, left out the flaked coconut, added 1/2 teaspoon of cloves and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. Everything else was just as written. Makes great muffins too!

I made this after reading the reviews. I used 1 1/2 cups brown sugar and left out the white sugar. I left out the coconut and substituted 1/2 the oil for applesauce. I added some cloves, ginger, and mace to the mix. This is plenty sweet and it cooked in about an hour in my oven. Can't wait to make it again for the holidays! Thank you for the great recipe!

I made this after reading the reviews. I used 1 1/2 cups brown sugar and left out the white sugar. I left out the coconut and substituted 1/2 the oil for applesauce. I added some cloves, ginger, and mace to the mix. This is plenty sweet and it cooked in about an hour in my oven. Can't wait to make it again for the holidays! Thank you for the great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and I didn't love this. The bread was very dark and I could fast the baking soda. I loved the idea of coconut milk but this did not wow me.

This looked and tasted like a brick from my driveway. I was making it for friends and had to throw away. Maybe eggs would have helped.

Incredible!! So moist and delicious! I did what a few other suggested and substituted the applesauce for the oil. Also I omitted the flaked coconut and nuts and it's fantastic! I make a small loaf and 12 muffins with this recipe.

Used 2 1/2 cups all purpose flour and 3/4 c whole wheat flour.  Baking time was too long for glass bread pans.  Next time I'll lower temperature to 325F but will still check at 1 hour.   Seems to get better with "age" - left wrapped in foil for a couple of days and served it to friends with whipping cream.  What's not to like about that!   Next time I'll try substituting applesauce for the coconut milk and salad oil as others have suggested for a somewhat healthier version..

This bread IS delicious, however, trying to slice it is another store.   The bread fell apart into chunks.  I made it to take to church and was only able to get a few pieces that weren't mangled.

This recipe makes a dense, substantial bread. I didn't realize it until after, but its also vegan , and handy for that reason. The cook time given was too long- I took it out early because it was starting brown up too much. We enjoyed the nuts and coconut addition. Thank you!

I did make changes. I left out the white sugar as it was sweet enough w brown sugar. I also added 2 beaten eggs and a cup of sour cream. It turned out very good!!! I recommend this recipe w the changes u made to it. I used while milk in place to f the coconut milk as I didn't have any of that.
I was wondering why there weren't any eggs in it? I have never made anything wo eggs and that's why I added 2. I'm ild school I guess!

After skimming thru other reviews, I cut back on the oil and sweeteners. I replaced all the sugar with 1 cup of date honey, used just half a cup of oil and skipped the coconut milk  (since I was using a liquid sweetener, I  didn't want to use too much liquid). I also added a bit more spice (1 tsp each cardamom and ginger). Came out moist, fluffy and just a touch of sweetness to set off the pumpkin and spices. Yum!

I love this recipe. It multiplies well. I multiply by 20 for work and it is wonderful. Due to limited supplies coconut milk is not available. I substitute half Sweetened Condensed milk and half Evaporated Milk. It still works fine. For variation I leave out the nuts and coconut. It still worked well. This has become a standard in camp. Thanks!

Yummy and moist!  As with many other cooks, I made a few changes, namely using a bit less coconut milk and oil (1/2 cup each), but adding 3 mashed bananas and an egg (similar to the applesauce substitutions of others).  I also added cranberries to my bread for an additional yummy flavour!

I just made this exactly as the recipe states. It is perfect as is. I will point out to those applesauce substituters that coconut milk is extremely healthy and by adding applesauce you are putting way more carbs and sugar into a recipe that already has plenty. That stuff is way unhealthier for you than oil and coconut milk.

Our family loves this recipe. My daughter is allergic to milk, so it's always nice to find baking recipes that don't use it. We've substituted almond milk for coconut milk and 1/2 the nuts with chocolate chips and it is fabulous!
Note: Today I made this recipe as mini loaves. Baked 35 minutes and they're just as delicious as always!

Great! ! Slightly altered. Used almond milk, subbed 1/2 c crushed pecans for walnuts and used 12 oz pumpkin plus 8 oz unsweetened applesauce and added about 3/4 cup oats and 1 tsp vanilla. Would cut down on the oil next time. Made 3 loaves last night and only have 1/2 left.

Made this at work now three times and every time it gets rave comments from the customers. I did my own special touches though that If I told you, you might have to go into hiding. Lol.

This is one of those recipes that you can experiment with and have fantastic results from experimentation.

I thought this recipe looked easy and amazing, but I was wrong. Like others have stated mine came out way too gooey. The only parts I could salvage were a few end pieces. I cooked these loaves for about a half an hour longer than stated and it still was not enough for the middle. I wound up with a mildly burnt outside and a, pretty much, raw inside. Although I'm considering that my oven may be partially to blame.

Recently, I've had to go off all dairy, gluten, soy, egg, and many other things.  I've had trouble finding 'treats' to get me through.  This is the yummiest bread!  I had to substitute the flour for gluten free flour, and coconut oil for vegetable oil.  I also omitted the coconut flakes and nuts.  I added about a cup of Enjoy Life chocolate chips.  What a yummy treat!  I've made muffins(which are so good!) mini loaves and regular loaves and they are all good!  Thank you!

Replaced white flour with wheat flour and pumpkin puree with fresh cooked pumpkin, added almond extract because I did not have any walnuts and added an egg to bind and rise a little higher. Cooked 1/2 as muffins and 1/2 as bread ... might put pistachios in them next time :)

I made this gluten free by substituting Better Batter GF flour. It is a dense loaf. I halved the amount of regular sugar and used unsweetened coconut flakes. I used pecans instead of walnuts. It also only baked for 1 hour and 2 minutes. It turned out soooooo tasty! The nutmeg flavor was a tad strong for me so next time I will use a little less. I will definitely be adding this to my regular rotation.

It was okay.  I added pumpkin pie spice hoping it would ease the nutmeg flavor.  The spices were a little too overbearing for me, but for others it may have been just fine.  My bread was too dense for my preference, but moist.  I may alter the recipe the next time, that is if I get ambitious again.

The only thing I changed was I substituted applesauce for all the oil and coconut milk. It turned out really moist and you won't notice the applesauce at all. I didn't use coconut or walnuts either. I made this into muffins and a mini loaf.

This recipe is so delicious.  So, so moist.  It is hearty and satifying.  I used whole wheat flour and added flax seed.  My entire family loved it including my 7 year old son.  He eats it for breakfast!

Followed this recipe exactly and used unsweetened coconut milk. It smelled great while cooking, however, it was way,way too sweet! All's we could taste was brown sugar and nutmeg.

this came out delicious! I can't eat egg, and was so excited to finally find an egg-free recipe that is super yummy!    the only tip I have to offer is, check it at 1 hour; mine got a bit burned on the top (but still tasty) at 1 hour 15min.

Good bread though not "out of this world" good.  I substituted applesauce for the oil, left out the nuts and added a dash of cloves.  This is a good recipe for those who may be lactose intolerant.

Have now made this 3 times, modifying the recipe according to other users' advice. Have indeed made some well-spiced pumpkin bread loaves, but we have never really 'loved' any of them. No matter what I've added or subtracted, I have always ended up with an incredibly dense, dry bread. I guess we prefer a recipe that turns out more like cake than bread. The recipe is very unique, though, thank you for sharing!

The finished product was dry and the flavor was bland. I did not have coconut milk so I substituted buttermilk. Next time I'll use the coconut milk and add more spices..

I recently made this bread when searching for vegan recipes. I omitted the coconut and the nuts ( I didn't have any) and added 1 tsp of ginger.( You can't have pumpkin without ginger!!) It was amazing! Everyone who ate it said it was delicious. I'm gonna make another batch and freeze it for later. Again, awesome bread!!!!

This bread was delicious!  I omitted the coconut flakes and walnuts because my husband and son don't like either and it was still delicious.  I didn't tell my husband it had coconut milk in it and he loved it even though he hates coconuts.  I can't wait to make more.  My husband ate most of it.

Delicious.  Can't taste the coconut milk, just adds moisture.  And the coconut adds a great texture to the bread.  I made 1/2 the recipe into muffins.  Will make again and freeze to use up the coconut milk.  I found the coconut milk in a can in the speciality area of my grocery store.

My home smells so wonderful from the baking of this recipe.  Instead of adding coconut to the recipe i sprinkled it on top so it toasted it.  also instead of using pumpkin I used pumpkin butter.  I didn't have enough coconut milk so I used a little almond milk.  very good and moist.

This was a very heavy bread, but it is very moist. I used pecans instead of walnuts... not sure if I'll make again. Might have been too heavy for my taste.

I made this recipe without the nuts or coconut since I was sharing with co-workers and didn't want to encounter allergies. I also substituted lite coconut milk instead of full fat.   Both loaves came out perfectly! Recipe lives up to the moist claim. Since I plan on making this again, I will be adding walnuts (or pecans) that are called for as I did want it to have a little more to it for home.

My family devoured it! My kids have always loved pumpkin bread and this was, by far, the best I have ever made.  I omitted the nuts and coconut and the next time I make it will probably omit the white sugar too since the coconut milk gives it added sweetness.  It was incredibly moist and was even better the next day!

This was great even though when I went to add the coconut I found out that what i thought was tossed on the back shelf was coconut was powdered sugar.  I used a pumkin my son brought home from a field trip, roasted it the night before and used that.  The whole family raved about the bread so I am making it again tonight.  What I am changing from the last time is I am actually going to use sweetened coconut, chopped hazel nuts, and medium sweet chocolate chips.

I followed the recipe exactly. the batter was so good that i almost didn't want to bake it. I think that the flaked coconut gave this bread a slightly different texture. my dad said that this bread was too dense, but everyone else loved it!

This is a great recipe, I've made it several times both as listed and with modifications.  The modifications I make are: using all wheat flour, substituting about a 1/4 cup of molasses for some of the sugar, and no flaked coconut.  Turns out great every time!

I followed the recipe except no nuts (food allergy) and I used a half cup of unsweetened applesauce and half cup of oil.  It was very moist, but something is missing.  Not as sweet as I hoped for, but it's not bad either.

I over cooked it, my oven cooked it alot faster than the time called for. But it was excellent. Has a wonderful flavor and I love the shredded coconut in the bread and the walnuts are a must. Will definitely be making this one again.

Wow this is really good! I've never baked with coconut milk before, and I loved the consistency of it. I had homemade pumpkin butter that I used in place of the canned pumpkin, so I adjusted the sugar & spices a little bit, and I added cardamom. I used half applesauce for the oil and omitted the nuts and coconut. Very moist bread and just delicious.

I halve this recipe and make 12 muffins, but only cook for about 45 minutes. These are friggin AWESOME muffins! They are moist, but not at all "gummy" like vegan muffins can tend to be - trust me, no one will ever EVER guess these are vegan! They are simply delicious!! The best!!! Even my sister-in-law, a pastry chef, was raving about them and said I should sell them! Thank you!

Great flavor...the texture isn't as dense and moist as I thought it would be. Still, a very good pumpkin bread! (I didn't have the shredded coconut so it was left out - but I doubt it had that much of an impact on texture).

Amaaaazing recipe. So easy. Wonderful results. Got great reviews from friends and family too. And vegan?! Wow, who ever thought vegan'd be this good? Can't wait to share this and give this as a Christmas gift to my lactose intolerant buddies. Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow... Super, SUPER moist and great flavor!  I just made 3 loaves for our out-of-town holiday guests.  It's the perfect tropical, Florida treat for our Colorado friends!

I used a fresh sugar pumpkin for this recipe- cut in half, removed seeds, and baked at 350 for an hour, then cooled and pureed the flesh.  This bread IS moist!  It was fun to use the coconut milk.  I couldn't really taste it, but not sure if you're supposed to or if it's just for texture.... I would add a little more cinammon next time.  I did half whole wheat pastry flour, and half unsweetened applesauce for the oil (used canola).  I didn't have time to toast the walnuts and it was still good.  This has a really mild flavor.  I kind of wish I had added some chocolate chips, but it is still good without them (just not great, for me at least).  It is very good sliced with just a touch of butter.

Followed the recipe exactly (I thought) but not too impressed. Really crusty on the outside and kind of gooey in the middle - The flavor was really good but the texture was bad. Okay recipe but not my favorite.

It makes me sad.  I baked for an hour, checked it (wet), and finished out the last fifteen minutes (still wet).  After going by quarter-hour cooking times, it spent an extra hour in the oven.  The edges burned nicely, but it was still a gooey mess whenever I tested it with a toothpick.  Gave up around three am out of frustration.  I'm sure it would have been great if it could have achieved a solid state, because it smelled wonderful.

Delicious and VERY moist!  The coconut milk is a GREAT addition, and the other ingredients work together very well.  This recipe is going to be used again and again!

A HUGE hit at our family holiday party. I skipped the walnuts for allergy reasons.  Wonderful when served with a dollop of whipped cream. Yum!

This is a delicious bread that my family really enjoys! I am allergic to nuts so I leave the walnuts out but it is still devine. And boy is it moist!
