This recipe certainly took the chicken breast to another level.These simple ingredients packed some powerful & delicious flavor for such a quick and easy recipe.  I made this as directed but I did use a yellow onion because that is all I had. I also added just a touch of butter to the chicken pan to help brown the chicken better. Sparky declared this five stars and wants it on a regular rotation. I concur! Try this....you'll LOVE it! Thanks for sharing Bibi!

I let the chicken simmer is the sauce for a few to let the sauce reduce and thicken. It was delicious.

Very tasty, exactly as written, except I used extra marjoram and garlic powder on the vegs.  The mustard sauce adds a nice flavor.  It was runny, so I added corn starch.

The honey mustard chicken is nice although I think the vegetables can do with more seasoning.

Five stars from my husband for his favorite style of cooked root veg and flavourful chicken.  He also likes that there is not a lot of dishes.  Made as written, except to use a combination of butter and oil for frying the chicken and only 1/4 cup broth for sauce.  The sauce was not thin and there was lots for four chicken breasts.

Very good! I gave it 4 stars because the whole grain mustard wasn't a great compliment to the chicken. I actually added a good spoonful of regular Dijon to the sauce and was better. Roasted vegetables were excellent! I will make this again but will make some changes

My husband is pretty picky and he loved this meal.  I cooked the veggies about 45 minutes because I don't like my veggies crunchy.  The sauce for the chicken was really tasty and the meal overall was pretty easy to make. I will put this on my favorite list!!

Deeeeelishus!  The only different thing I did was throw a little brown sugar on the veggies halfway through.  Served it w/rice.  Even my picky husband had seconds.  It's a keeper!

This is a great dish! I needed something everyone who attended the potluck could eat. We make this recipe as stated when we are home but, if you cube the chicken it is perfect for potlucks. Everyone loves it and it is very simple to prepare.

I didn't love this, but that might be because I'm not a big mustard fan. I also thought the veggies were a little bland.

Easy and tasty. Chopping vegetables is a bit time consuming. I replaced the wine with additional broth, but found the sauce runnier than I anticipated.

Great dish for entertaining.  Be careful on the chicken, easy to overcook.  Pretty easy to make, longest part was peeling and dicing all the veggies.  Also, didn't know I was going to have to pound the chicken to 1/2 inch.  But overall, I'll probably make again.  It was very good and healthy!

Loved this.  The sauce is so good.  Did have to thicken it with a little cornstarch mixed with water.  Changed the veggies a bit too - used broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and sweet potato (what I had on hand) and only used a smidge of dried rosemary since we don't care for that flavor very much.  Delicious and easy chicken dish!  Would definitely make again.

I made the chicken with just chicken broth and mustard when on my sugar detox.  Absolutely delicious!! Didn't try the vegetables though.

YUM!  The sauce on this was so delicious!  I roasted the veggies and seasoned with salt, pepper, oregano and thyme.  The veggies took a while to roast (as usual).  I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder and sauteed it in butter and olive oil.  Added some corn starch to the sauce at the end to thicken it up.  It was delicious!

Excellent!  Doubled the sauce and added a bit of cayenne to it.  Don't like parsnips so added a couple yukon gold potatoes.  Veggies took 20 minutes to roast. Did not pound the chicken, just cut it into large pieces.

I loved the roasted veggies and will make that part again.  Surprisingly, I did not like the combo of the whole-grain mustard and honey.  Maybe I would like Dijon better?

Not a fan at all! The honey did not go well with the mustard. I'm allergic to wine so I added a little white balsamic (which is what I've done in dozens of other recipes which have been fabulous) and the end result was yuck!

Certainly fits the bill as an easy and healthy meal, but it just didn't pack enough flavor for a repeat preformance.

I actually enjoyed the vegetables more than the chicken. Good guidelines for preparing tasty veggies.

4 1/2 STARS

This turned out very good and we'll make it again. I didn't have the wine so I left that out, I think it definitely is a key ingredient. I'll also add some kind of herb next time... what goes good with mustard?

 We also made a butternut squash risotto instead of the roasted root veggies having just eaten them twice this week already. 

All in all a very satisfying dinner.

We left the white wine out and we really enjoyed the taste.  We will definitely make this again with the white wine next time and probably pair it with a salad.

Left out the honey.  Just needed more flavor.
