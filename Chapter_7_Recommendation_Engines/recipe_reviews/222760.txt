Delicious eggs. I looked at 4 different stores for lobster. I only found live whole ones and I really wanted to try these. I used lobster flavored chunks which I am sure are not as good as the real thing. The tarragon wa a nice tough.. Only thing I would change is a tad more cayenne..

Our eyes were obviously bigger than our stomachs last night for our New Year’s Eve dinner of broiled lobster tails and Alaskan King Crab legs.  I ended up with a fair amount of it left over (even tho’ the only side I served with it was hot, clarified butter!).  This simple recipe of basically scrambled eggs with lobster meat folded into it came up using the AR ingredient search.  Rather than for its complexity or creativity, it inspired me for a way to make use of the leftovers for our breakfast this morning.  I expanded on this basic recipe to suit our own tastes and give it some complexity.  First, we’re not fans of tarragon, for either its flavor or its boldness, and I think I’d like it even less with lobster. I didn’t want to mask the delicious, sweet flavor of the lobster even a teeny bit, and for us tarragon surely would have done that.   Fresh dill was a much more appealing option for us.  For the same reason I did not add the cayenne.  I could have stopped there, but to make it even more rich, creamy and decadent, I added small cubes of cream cheese at the very end of the cooking process.  Four stars for inspiration, five stars for outstanding taste with some tweaking.

Decadent and yet so easy, what a great combination!  I omitted the tarragon, as I do not care for it.  We served it to friends and it was a treat for all. I used a whole steamed lobster, leftover from the previous night. We will plan ahead to have these for breakfast from now on the morning after we enjoy steamed lobster for dinner.

Easy and so tasty! I thawed a frozen lobster tail. The tarragon and cayenne was lovely.

I was sceptical about the tarragon and the cayenne overwhelming the lobster but I went along with the recipe as written and it was delicious. I will definitely make this again.

I loved the idea of this recipe, I'm on a low carb, high protein diet so this fits the bill. I substituted fennel fronds for the tarragon because I had them, and found it as a recommended substitute. Overall the combination was a little too "chewy" for my liking. I might have gone too light on the cayenne, because it didn't have a lot of flavor. I guess I prefer lobster just dipped in melted butter, and my eggs with salt and pepper!

It's okay. I may have cooked the eggs a bit too long, but I didn't have any creaminess and it turned out kind of grey. Not sure if it was the Cayenne or what...

The ingredient list doesn't call for tarragon but on the preparation does. How much tarragon should one add?

I found this recipe when I happened to have a bit of lobster meat left over and decided to whip up a quick meal for just myself.  I was quite please with the results. Of course, how can anything mess up lobster!

Maybe it was just my taste, but I really didn't care for this.
