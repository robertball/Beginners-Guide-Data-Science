Was very dry, wonder if an ingrediant or two may have been left out.  turned out crumbly and looked more like granola.  The only liquid is the melted butter.

These were the hit of the holiday season! Excellent flavor - not too sweet. I've made these numerous times. You must be sure to spray the pan liberally with the cooking spray as they tend to stick to the pan. Also, measure exactly because you need every bit of the butter as these are a crumbly type of cooky. If you wanted more moisture, you could increase the butter.
