I served this for a group of friends and they all loved it!  Instead of custard cups, I used individual size pre-made graham cracker crumb crusts you can buy in the baking section.  It stretches the recipe out to serve 14 and reduces the dishes!  Great recipe, I have already had a request for it!

One of the best desserts we've ever had. I didn't bother making this in individual servings, I just greased one 8x8 baking pan, spread the apple filling over the bottom, mixed up the pumpkin mixture and poured that over the top, then sprinkled the gingersnap topping over the pumpkin layer. I did take another reviewer's suggestion and added a little more butter to the "topping", just a couple tablespoons. I baked this for about 25 minutes at 350*. I think this could use more of the gingersnap mixture but this was so yummy, we really didn't care. We all loved this. Next time, I'll take another reviewer's suggestion and make this in a pie crust (either graham, gingersnap or oatmeal cookie crust--I think they'd all be good). Very adaptable, wonderfully comforting fall dessert. We absolutely loved it.

Excellent!!  I didn't have custard cups so I put this in an 8 x 10 casserole dish and it worked out just fine.  I'd like to try it in a regular pie crust, too!

I made this recipe in a pie plate and it turned out well.  Definitely serve this warm, it wasn't as good at room temperature.  I used crushed graham crackers, as I did not have ginger snaps.  It was pretty tasty, though kind of bland.  I'd like to try the ginger snaps for some added flavor.

Loved it! I added ginger snap crumb crust (saturated with butter) pressed into bottom buttered, large cake tin.  I also added ground cloves to the spices.  Turned up the heat to 400 about 5 minutes before I thought it might be done.  Continued baking until toothpick came out clean.  Served cold with lightly sweetened whipped cream.  Absolutely delicious!

I used aluminum foil muffin tins so that it would be disposable. Using the tins allowed me to make a different amount. Everybody loved them.

These are fantastic!  Even my kids will eat them and I feel good about a relatively healthy dessert.

Was really excited to try this for New Year's. I baked them in little canning jars and they looked really cute and it was really easy to do. The clear canning jars showed the different layers.  But as for the flavor, they were overly sweet and didn't have a whole lot of flavor. The canned apple pie filling really lacks in flavor and I could only get three slices of apple in the jar. Would be better with a homemade apple pie filling and apple chunks instead of slices. The pumpkin filling could use an increase in spices.

very delicious and easy to make.  I made my own apple pie filling which didn't take long- I made it in an 8 x8 pan instead of custard cups.  Worked out great- everyone loved it.

I just made this recipe last night for a dinner party.  Everyone loved it and I just got a request for the recipe.  I made it according to directions, but the baking time was off--I had to bake it about 15 min. longer than the directions to get the pumpkin to set, but my ingredients were all cold too.  Put a dollop of cool whip on top.

My sister made this dessert and sadly, no one liked it. Apples and pumpkin just don't taste good together. Pumpkin pie or apple pie is much better than this tart combination. It tasted like a dish from the 1800s before they knew how to make desserts taste sweet and good. I wouldn't recommend this.

This was so delicious! It's great because it's so easy to make--I don't really like to cook--the pumpkin with apple was a pleasant and tasty combination which nicely surprised everyone. Even the light eaters finished all of theirs. This recipe is definitely a keeper for me!

The BOMB!!  I have been making this recipe since around 1995.  This is an absolute favorite in our house.  I always make this at Thanksgiving (actually for the past 2 years my son makes them) as it gives us the feeling of both apple and pumpkin pie all in one.  I always double the recipe and use ramekin dishes as my kids love to share them with friends.  I use the recipe as written. Wouldn't change a thing!!
