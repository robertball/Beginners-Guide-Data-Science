This vinaigrette is easy to make and tasty. I used the lemon juice and not the rice wine. Will make a large quantity and keep in frig.

I made the mistake of putting this on my salad immediately after it was done. WRONG!!! After a few hours, I went to re-try my creation and it had thickened. My only suggestion next time would be to use less olive oil.

I am new to making my own dressing and was hesitant about this one since the ingredients sounded so basic but I was greatly surprised about how well it tasted.  I used Lemon Juice and Mayo and it was great on a green salad with tomato, cuc, and Feta.  Next time I will try and add some fresh or dry herbs to it.  Note: Can not keep long in fridge b/c the dressing separates and turns clumpy beyond saving.  Mine went bad in a week.

This is an easy and quick dressing recipe.  It has a heavy dijon mustard taste that I did find slightly over powering.  I added a little sugar as well as the vinaigrette is very tangy.  I also added a little dried tarragon.  I served the dressing over a green salad with tomatoes and feta cheese.  It was a nice compliment.

This was easy and delicious - I used rice wine vinegar and Hellman's lite mayo with minced garlic from the jar.  I used slightly less than 2/3 c. of light olive oil.  I put everything into a jar with a tight fitting lid and shook it without a problem.  It blended perfectly.  It was nice and creamy and went great over romaine lettuce with thin slice cucumber, cherry tomatoes and thin sliced red onion.

I made this with the rice vinegar and mustard and thought it was great on the pasta salad I made with grilled veggies!  It's very light and tasty.

Delicious! I used fresh lemon juice. When I need lemon zest I juice the lemons and freeze the juice so I had it on hand.  I served steamed salmon on a bed of greens and drizzled this dressing all over it. My husband ate every last bit! Thanks! A+++

Excellent, simply outstanding vinaigrette. Given the ingredient options, I chose to use lemon juice (not rice wine vinegar) and Dijon mustard (not mayonnaise). I did stream in the olive oil while whisking with a wire whisk and ended up with this beautiful emulsion.  And as if it wasn't good already, I took it over the top by adding a short squirt of anchovy paste. I used this for the dressing on "Easy and Fast Cajun Chicken Caesar Salad" (another fine recipe!) for an outstanding main dish salad.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, however I plan to. I had to search "how to emulsify dressing" as I didn't quite understand the term. Which is why I'm reviewing in hopes this bit of info might help a few people.

What you're essentially emulsifying is the vinegar/lemon juice with the oil. The emulsifying agent is the mustard (I suppose mayo would work but it seems to me mustard would be better).

The key steps are to add the oil in slowly and gradually while whisking. This provides you control over the consistency of the dressing (more oil and you'll end up with custom mayonaise) and whisking aerates the mixture which is essential to emulsification. Shaking would also do the trick, but gives you no control over consistency.

An emulsified dressing should only be kept for a week, refridgerated. Also, a tip on one of the tutorials was to toss/use the dressing only 15 minutes in advance.
Hope that helps.

Amazing!  I used mayo for my first attempt, but I'm very excited about trying it with Dijon.  I used this vinaigrette for a pasta salad and there wasn't a noodle left in the bowl!  Every person who tried it asked me how to make it.  I added 2 extra cloves of garlic (my family loves garlic) and a teaspoon of Oregano for some color.  This has become my go-to salad/pasta dressing.

I found that if you put all of the ingredients in a Mason jar and shake, then your dressing will emulsify and you don't have to worry about streaming in the oil.

I chose this dressing because I was in a pinch and I had all the ingredients. I used the mayonnaise and vinegar combination. I added very little salt. I liked the recipe for ease of preparation, but felt it lacked a bit in flavor. I think the addition of some herbs might be good here. This is a good base recipe that won't mask the flavor of the salad it's dressing.

I made this with fresh lemon juice and Italian seasoning added to ingredients. Used my food processor,  that made it perfectly creamy fast. I didn't drizzle oil;  wasn't needed using processor. However this wasn't our favorite without adding sugar, and I wasn't shy about how much I added either. If I were going to use this in pasta salad; I wouldn't add as much. I suggest you add sugar by teaspoonfuls to taste, if desired. Will probably use a little less olive oil next time as well. With these changes will make again. Three stars as written...five stars with changes.

4 stars for simplicity and adaptability.  I doubled the recipe as I had a large veggie & pasta salad, and used 2 T. mustard & 2 T. mayo.  This combo was good as neither was overwhelming.  I did add italian spice, because without it there was something lacking....good and basic, but not exactly what I was looking for.  Great starter recipe.  I've also used apple cider vinegar, which was good as well.

I flipped the proportions of the rice wine vinegar to the olive oil for use on a pasta salad.  It was tasty and tart without being too oily.  Wonderful recipe!

Actually very easy.  Modified some for taste on our end we used 1/2C red wine vinegar and 2 Tblsp. regular mustard (didn't have Dijon) and 2 Tblsp. Mayo.  Added more garlic and garlic salt instead of regular salt.  Added pinch of cayanne pepper to taste along with  1 tsp sugar.  Used less than 1/2 C olive oil.  Yum!!!!!!!!!!!  Mixed in a 4C measuring cup.  Easy.  Thanks.

I used the lemon juice version and it was fantastic on a shrimp pasta salad.  It was a little too tangy, but I added Parmesan cheese to the salad and it balanced the lemon perfectly.  Sprinkled the whole works with parsley, then had three helpings. Mmmm... this will be added to my core stock of recipes for sure!

mmm tangy, the way I like it. I used creole mustard instead because that's what I had and thought the graininess gave it a nice texture.

I can't tell you when I last bought salad dressing, as I have been making my own for so long.  This one did not cut it.  I used lemon juice and dijon mustard, and I did not care for the blend of flavors.  I've found in the past that dijon works well with vinegar, but I did not like it with the lemon.    I think less mustard would work better, too.  One tablespoon only might make a tastier dressing.  I'm not going to try this again to find out, though.  There's lots of other fish in the sea.

Good, but either use less oil or increase the amounts of the other ingredients, because it dilutes the taste a bit.

Delicious. It's tangy! Everywhere it said use either/or, we just split the two things and used half of each. It's now a new family favorite.

This was a very nice dressing.  I made it exactly how it was supposed to be on the recipe.  I used rice wine vinegar and russian mustard on a pasta salad with feta, sweet onion, black olives, celery.  I shook on greek spice before the dressing.

I just tried this today on a cold pasta salad, and let it chill in the fridge for a couple hours in a tupperware. I shook it again inside the container before serving as the dressing had separated, but it still tasted excellent! I used finely chopped red onion, halved grape tomatoes, chopped celery, feta crumbles, and diced ham- I chose apple cider vinegar though rather than the rice variety, along with the mayo, salt and pepper, olive oil, and some basil.

Great dressing. I used mustard and rice wine vinegar. The mustard helps it to stay emulsified and not separate if you want to keep it in the fridge for a while. I use less olive oil- equal parts vinegar and oil- and I think it's plenty. It's good on a green salad with feta and roast beef. I may try it on a pasta salad and see how that is as well.

I am relatively new at making my own dressings, and lately what I've come up with has been disappointing.  After finding this recipe and trying it out, I am so pleased!!  This was delicious.  I followed some of the other reviewers' advice and only added 1/3 cup of oil.  Next time I make it I want to try it with flax seed oil that I have in the fridge :)

This was delicious.  I used lemon juice, extra garlic....served it over pasta, roasted veggies.  It was a hit.

Delicious and fresh tasting! I used less oil (1/2 cup) and a bit more lemon juice as I thought it may be too oily on a salad.  I will definitely make this again.

This was so easy and good.  Totally simple ingredients that I normally have on hand.  Everyone enjoyed it.

Really good. I used the rice vinegar and mayo and added a little sugar.  Great for any salad (used on a green salad).

Used ACV, squeeze of fresh lemon, dash of caper juice, mayo, used less olive oil, garlic, fresh herbs, salt n pepper, 2 pinches of sugar. Added all into a mason jar and shook it up. Delicious!  Love the versatility of this recipe.

I did a mix of all the suggested ingredients - lemon juice, rice vin, mayo & dijon. Take the advice to stir oil in super slow and you get a delicious, creamy, tangy lemon vinaigrette. Delicious on Niçoise salad!

As advertised, easy  and tasty. I used white wine vinegar and Dijon mustard. It's a very nice basic that can be altered to go with the menu - and being creamy makes a welcome change from the usual vinaigrette. Thanks a bunch!

This is the second time I have used this recipe.  The first time was for a large gathering of 50 people and I used it as a dressing for pasta salad.  It was delicious and by following the directions, it turned out to be the perfect dressing.  I did add herbs to the pasta salad, parsley, oregano, basil, etc.  The second time was for a 12 serving pasta salad and I think next time I will increase the amount of vinegar just to give it a little more tang.

This is quite tasty and had a nice zing to it.  I prepared a huge tossed grilled chicken salad for family and guests and sort of planned the salad around this dressing.  Everyone complimented.  It offers more flavor sitting in the fridge for a few hours before you're ready to use it.

This was delicious.  I also added a pinch of dried tarragon.  I used this on baby spinach salad and it was perfect!
