Has been a favorite appetizer for more than 20 years. I use a small can of crab meat and defrosted salad shrimp (squeeze all the water out of them) instead of all shrimp. I also have substituted low fat cream cheese lite mayo and low sodium cream of mushroom soup to make the dish a bit lighter. I present it in a crab shaped mold over a bed of lettuce greens. Still tastes yummy. Great because it is made ahead of time. My kids loved to dive into the leftovers when they were younger (if there were any). Serves a large crowd.

Just made this AGAIN!!! Please try this. The requests that I get for this recipe is constant!!!! This deserves 10 stars! I added two minced JALAPENO'S to the mix for an extra "kick". My girlfriends raved that it was awesome a real crowd pleaser.. Some wished that they could make a sandwich out of it. Please try it it will not look like much until it is cold I was sooooo happy with the outcome.

This molded "mousse" tastes great! I will definitely make this again. Next time I will chop the shrimp a little smaller though or use two-three cans of drained tiny shrimp. It is also very pretty if you use a decorative mold.

Guests hovered around this when I served it as an appetizer. Found it is just as easy to use crab salmon or even baby shrimp in this. Also added 1 tsp worchestershire sauce too and it made it a little more tangy.

I love this recipe and so does my family. I pipe it into puff pastry shells (like cream puff shells but with less sugar) They are the BOMB!

A surefire crowd pleaser: I have been trying to find a recipe like this for a long time. I substitute condensed tomato soup for celery soup (it gives it a great flavor and color) and I garnish the bottom of the mold with whole shrimps (so they come out on top of the mousse)and serve with Carr's water crackers YUMMY!

I love this recipe could eat it with a spoon! I use cream of mushroom soup instead of celery just because we always have that in the cupboard. This is a favorite!

I used 3 cans of the tiny shrimp instead of the 2 cups minced cooked shrimp and it was absolutely delicious! Great recipe!

I have made this recipe for over 30 years. The recipe was given to me by my mother-in-law and no one I know in Maryland has ever seen the recipe. I always add some hot sauce or Tabasco and sometimes OldBay or diced green or peppers.

I was very sceptical I didn't believe that so few shrimps could make it taste shrimpy but it works really well. I used mushroom soup and I didn't have any celery so did without but it was still great. Will definately use for the next party - I may try the suggestion of a little jalepeno but it doeesn't really need it.

This can be 5 stars! I've had this recipe for years and always used condensed tomato soup. The color enhances the shrimp appeal in this appetizer. Use fresh chopped shrimp and save a couple of whole to slice in half (not canned). Place halved slices of shrimp on the bottom of the mold so that when it is inverted on plate you have a beautiful presentation of shrimp on top. Also add 1/4 tsp. Old Bay Seasoning to the soup as it is being heated. Truly a very impressive appetizer with parsley surrounding it on a white serving tray.
