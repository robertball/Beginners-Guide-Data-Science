Based on the reviews, I thought this was going to be great, but I was disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly, but the noodles seemed to suck up all the sauce and the dish was dry.  Also we thought the fish sauce taste was much too strong.  Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

Awesome recipe! Not your average pad Thai with peanut flavor, but it tastes exactly like one of the top Chinese restaurant's pad Thai in Cleveland. I did use Mai Fun noodles because we love a lighter tasting pad Thai. Great recipe overall.

I made this exactly as is except omitted the optional sliced red chile pepper. Excellent! It made so much that I brought to my in-laws and they all really liked it.

This was very good, but VERY spicy!  I even left out the chili oil, and holy cow it was hot!  I ended up using almost a cup of melted creamy peanut butter with some rice vinegar and brown sugar and stirred that in.... still spicy, but much easier to eat.  This also made a very large quantity.  Lastly, I am no major chef, but the prep time an this was about 60-75 minutes....  this is no quick weeknight meal.  BUT, again, thank you so much for posting!

Wow.. I was a bit skeptical about trying this recipe. I'm a big fan of pad Thai noodles, and, I must say that this recipe is delish!!! My fiance and our family loved it! Thanks!

Loved this!  Easy and delicious.  We cut down on the chili oil and omitted the hot red chile pepper so that our kids could enjoy it too.

With the high reviews I was expecting something fabulous. I didn't even try a bite. So disappointing.

I have made this many times now and the family loves it.  As written it is on the spicy side but if you eliminate the chili oil it is fine.  It works great with leftover grilled chicken as well.  I think the 50 minute prepare time is a little long, most of the time it is chopping and soaking the noodles. Thanks for posting it.

I have always wanted to try this and had some shrimp that I  needed to use up so today was the day. I must say one thing---if you are not a fan of extra hot dishes, please go easy on the chili garlic sauce and the chili oil. I made the recipe with the original amounts but next time, I will decrease the amounts of both--one tbls.of chili sauce and one tsp. of the chili oil. Please add the chopped peanuts and the cilantro, even though the recipe says they are optional. The addition of these two ingredients really add to the flavors. Also, I had the thin rice vermicelli on hand which was from our Asian store but use the thicker ones as the vermicelli does not hold up . All in all, it was a very tasty recipe and I will try this again with chicken.

I followed the recipe pretty closely and I love the ingredients. I added a half of a red bell pepper with the celery and onions, I also added some chopped green onions with the peanuts and red chili peppers at the end. The only part that didn't come out well where the rice noodles. I knew when it said to boil the water and let them sit for 10 minutes that they were going to be too soft but I did it anyway and they were. Next time I'll put some warm water in a pan and let them soak until they are soft, not soggy.

It was great, I doubled the sauce because I like everything drenched so it was a little soupy in the end (plus the TJ noodles were 14oz.)  the boyfriend liked it more than I did although it was almost restaurant quality.

OK, this is NOT traditional Pad Thai, but this is a pretty good recipe. The heat is wonderful and the flavor very good. I had it with friends who made the shrimp recipe and then I made it at my home with marinated tofu. I would rate this a very good variation. I enjoyed the change. I am partial to the taste of tamarind in my pad thai so I added that last time and I changed the garlic chili sauce to a really good chili oil. It is one of my favorite variations.

These were just "eh" to us. I did not use the cabbage because I was out but followed everything else and adjust the chili garlic and chili.

Very good! I didn’t have chili oil, so I added an extra tablespoon of chili garlic sauce. I also substituted soy sauce for most of the fish sauce because I didn’t want too much of a fishy flavor. I added some fresh ginger, a cup of chopped orange bell pepper, a tablespoon of tamarind paste, and a few dashes of Chinese five-spice powder. Great flavor, and pretty spicy but not overwhelming.

Awesome Meal.  I added a side of Peanut-Coconut topped veggies from the freezer section and Jasmine Rice with toasted fresh sliced french bread to finish it and wow...  OH, i subbed the shrimp with Salmon Steak:  I removed the skin and cut it into 1" cubes.  WONDERFUL

This recipe was just ok. It does not taste like traditional Pad Thai. I found the flavors, other than the heat, to be bland. The heat was over whelming. In order to make it have any flavor other than hot, I did add a couple of tablespoons of peanut butter and brown sugar. I think without those additions it would not have even been just ok.

I was okay with this recipe. My husband and I have been searching far and wide for a grade A pad thai recipe.  This was okay but we both felt it was missing something. Tamerind? I am unsure. I prepared it exactly as directed except I used a 16 oz package of the rice noodles which works out pretty good if your not crazy about a whole ton of sauce.

Makes a really good sauce, and it's easy to substitute the veggies/meats.
