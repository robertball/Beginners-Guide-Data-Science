Maridele - I'm excited to be the first to review and photograph your yummy biscuits.  I had leftover ham that I finely chopped in my food processer - it worked great.  I loved the texture of the flattened biscuit in this little sandwich.  They came out of the oven nicely browned and I let sit for about 5 minutes to let the inside ingredients set up a bit.  I served this with fried potatoes and fresh strawberries and it made for a great meal.  I think it will be fun to try this with other meats.  We think leftover roast beef would be great with the swiss cheese.  Thanks for much for sharing your recipe!

Yum! I used Havarti instead of Swiss and a used muffin pan; it turned out like a little pot pie. The butter seemed a little weird but tasted really good! I think next time I will use cream cheese instead of butter and cheese, then add chopped dill pickles like a ham rollup! I also think using jalapeño and cream cheese would make an awesome jalapeño popper! Thanks for sharing a fun new staple recipe :)

Just made these and yummy. Although I used left over roast beef, fried a bit in some garlic onions and green peppers, added some swiss cheese. I also topped it with garlic butter, basil and parm cheese. It was fantastic. Will be making these again soon. Thanks for this.

Super easy and different.   Try with turkey or roast beef and different types of cheeses too.  I did not use canned ham - used thick ham slices that I diced.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were very good. I used sesame seeds for garnish instead of poppy seeds since I didn't have any (I didn't put any sesame seeds inside though the recipe calls for poppy seeds inside). I have to admit that I had never heard of canned ham which is weird because it was right there in plain sight when I went looking for it after finding this recipe...hmmmm. Anyway, versatile recipe, and I look forward to trying out different meat/cheese combos soon. Quick, easy lunch for the kids this summer. Something different.

I used leftover cooked ham, chopped in my food processor and butter instead of margarine. These were so very good and my husband is still raving about them this morning. My only problem was I used Pillsbury 7.5 oz. canned biscuits and they were very small and hard to get any bigger than 3 inches when flattened, so some of my seams came open while baking and cheese oozed out. I'll find larger biscuits next time I make these. I served them with a fruit salad with Poppy Seed Dressing I from this site, a perfect match. Would make a great brunch menu.

Oh, these were DELICIOUS! I have nver used/eaten canned ham like that before, so I was a little afraid, lol, but went ahead and made them anyway...soooo good! These were so buttery, flavorful and yummy! I used butter instead of margarine and used a little more onion than called for. I really can't get over how good these are, Maridele! I would make these again (w/ the canned ham) in a heartbeat! Thanks for sharing. :)

No crazy about this.  The canned ham was way too salty, which pretty much ruined the whole thing.  The concept is good though, maybe with shaved deli ham instead.

These were easy to make and also very good.  My daughter loved it so much.  The only thing missing were the poppy seeds which I forgot to pick up.  It's so cute when I had cut them in quarters, makes me want to throw a tea party lol.

This was an excellent recipe and oh so simple.  I made these for dinner one night, served them with scrambled eggs and mixed veggies.  

I will keep this in my back pocket for overnight guests.

Love this recipe! The first time I made it I didn't have all the ingredients so I used what I had. I just folded up the slice of deli ham and put the cheese on top.  Wonderful served with some honey mustard sauce for dipping.
