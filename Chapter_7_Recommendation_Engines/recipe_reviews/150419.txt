Very tasty!  These are a little different than most of the other porcupine ball recipes because these are more like a twist on spaghetti and meatballs, and are not as tangy as some others are.  I prefer this way.  I used 1.5 pounds of meat and barely came up with 21 meatballs (not 30 as shown), and I made them as small as I could without them falling apart.  I did not add the water because my meat mixture was already very loose.  Maybe my ground meat had too much moisture, which is possible because I had defrosted it from the freezer.  I did not stir them for fear of them falling apart, and some of them collapsed into the sauce anyway.  So, they were pretty soft, but nevertheless, they were very good.  We didn't care whether our meatballs were firm and round- that didn't affect the taste and we were going to cut them up on our plates anyway.  Very good recipe that I will definitely make again, probably with some bread crumbs to make them easier to form into balls if using fresh (not previously frozen) meat doesn't fix the problem.  I don't think there would ever be a need to add the water though.

This recipe turned out to be very easy and really yummy. My kids ate them up and then asked for seconds! Yay! I used Ground Turkey for my meatballs and they turned out just fine. I used 1.25 pounds for the meatballs and made the meatballs larger than what appears in the picture above. They stayed together well and I used the water with the recipe and everything. I didn't turn/stir mine. I just used a lid to cover them and I let them simmer for about 15/20 mins. They came out nice and firm! I recommend this recipe! I have some leftovers still even after the kids had seconds so I will see how they handle freezing and then re-heating for another meal. The meatballs are solid enough to make me think they will survive reheating!

Wow! I have never made this before!! My family greatly enjoyed this meal! It was very yummy in our tummies. It was really easy and quick to make! Just follow the recipe minus the water and your dinner will be out of this world. ... I feel really bad for anyone that has made this dish using this recipe and had it not turn out for them or thought that it was BLAND... I used this meal idea to feed 9 people!! GOOD LUCK AND ENJOY THIS DISH!!!!

Made to the recipe these are just ok. A little bland even with the meatloaf seasoning pack. A little dry. Very quick and easy though. But I wouldn't make again.

These were pretty tasty.  I used brown rice for an extra bit of nutrition, and couldn't tell a difference.  Instead of a jar of sauce, I used a homemade tomato sauce with plenty of garlic, herbs, green peppers, and onions.  The meatballs held together well and made for a nice dinner on a chilly evening.

These were okay. I thought they were very quick to make. I served them over whole wheat spaghetti and I used chunky garden style spaghetti sauce. They were very filling.I did the recipe exactly as written.

I used ground turkey in this recipe and completely cut out the water because it would have been like soup if I would have added it. I didn't really think these had very much flavor and just adding sauce no extras? Bad idea. I added garlic and onion, Italian seasoning and olive oil to the sauce. We didn't really enjoy these. They were edible but thats all I can say about them. I won't be making these again but they were quick to put together.

This was easy enough to make but even with a little italian seasoning these were bland, bland, BLAND. And a little salty. Kids ate them but the husband and I ate it grudgingly. I'll stick to my regular porcupine recipe.

His step mom makes them but i didn't want to call her for her recipe so i looked on my all recipe and used this one and i did use tomato soup instead of the spaghetti sauce and it was really good like that to, my kids are always beggin me to make this!! So, it was a huge hit at our house!!

Needs seasoning.. I sauteed garlic with the onions. Added onion salt, salt, pepper, italian seasoning, and also garlic powder.  Otherwise, a nice change from regular meatballs. Easy cooking.

Well, really I'd say 3 1/2 stars. These were easy to make and tasty, but nothing to write home about. I may make it again with modifications, as mine did come out a bit dry- but that could have been completely my own doing.

I made these as directed except I added cream of mushroom soup instead of the spaghetti sauce. It was really good! The ingredients held together very well even with my ground turkey! Added it with some veggies and mashed potatoes, YUM!!
