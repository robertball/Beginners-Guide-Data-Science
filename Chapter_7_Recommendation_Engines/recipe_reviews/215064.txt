This was a very tasty beet salad.  I used a yellow onion because that's what I had on hand.  I think a mild purple onion would work, but not a strong one, so be careful!:-)  I will use a ssweet onion next time.  The beets and oranges went together beautifully.  I did not use canned beets, but my own beets: oven roasted in foil, peeled, and then sliced.  It had a good flavor after 2 hours in the fridge.  I think it will taste even better tomorrow, and perhaps the onions will be milder and easier to eat.

We enjoyed this recipe very much.  I added a package of Truvia sweetner and used a white onion and it worked fine.  Will make again. Maxine

I had to sub red wine for cider vinegar.  It came out okay, but I think the cider vinegar would have been much better.  I also tried bottled orange juice first, and then dumped the liquid and used juce from the can of the mandarins instead, which was much better!  A little rosemary compliments this salad nicely, and it looks and tasted beautiful served over a small bed of greens!  Although, I might add a touch of olive oil or in the future to balance out the overwhelming acidity.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is very easy and very tasty - even for some of the hard to please palates in my family. Will definitely make this again, and recommend it for anyone who wants to impress. Will be great in summer months!

It's ok.  Way too ACV for my taste.  Not sure why it had so much liquid for this recipe.  Like to beet and orange favor together.

I love this salad - have enjoyed various forms of it for years - but this time I changed it just a little (based on others' suggestions): I used canned shoestring beets, canned mandarin oranges, half a large Maui sweet onion, some mint flakes, and added about a cup of chopped pecans. For the marinade I used mostly the juice from the oranges (and added regular OJ to make the 2 cups), and only about one cup of apple cider vinegar. I let it marinate about four hours, and will take it to a pot luck tomorrow afternoon. I really enjoyed the sample tastes I took of the finished product; I hope others will enjoy it, as well.

Very good! I'm sure the tartness (of the vinegar) could be increased if that's what the person likes.

Just tried it tonight.  I loved it and find the flavors interesting.  I suspect that I will really like it tomorrow and am considering use fresh mint as someone suggested  After my 1st serving, I added a little honey - though could not tell the difference.

It was a little odd tasting for me.  Not bad, but nothing I would make again.  The flavors just didn't meld very well - everything seemed like a separate flavor, and the beets just tasted like beets with orange juice on them and a little vinegar.
