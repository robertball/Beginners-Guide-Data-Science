A bit salty but VERY GOOD! I only had bread machine yeast so I used that and proofed it first with the water, salt and sugar-I read that it works better that way.  I also read that self rising flour works better for bagels so I used that as well. The dough was very dry, tough and hard to work with.  It also didn't seem to rise during the first 15 rest. They were tough to shape and then hardly rose even after 40 min.  They puffed up while boiling, which was good and baked well. Will definitely make again with some changes that are more like the actually recipe lol :)

I've made three different bagel recipes and this is by far the quickest and easiest. The flavor is delicious, though not as close to the bagels I'm accustomed to eating. I halved the recipe, made 5 giant bagels, boiled for 50 seconds, put a little coarse corn meal on the tray, did each rise an additional 10 minutes than written and baked for 25 minutes. The bagels are perfectly chewy on the outside, crisp on the bottom, and the right density texture inside. I ate one just out of the oven with butter, and then I pan fried the second and ate with cream cheese! Absolutely delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly except that I added an extra cup of water because the dough was unworkable. I got 25 good sized bagels and they taste fabulous. Will definitely be making them again.

The longer they rise for the better they'll be! I like to make twelve big bagels instead of twenty four mini ones, though.

Simple and delicious.  The dough is a delight to work with.  I used bread machine yeast, kosher salt, and warm water, and kneaded 12 minutes or so to get it elastic and smooth (it was never perfectly smooth). You really can just punch a hole in these bagels. I shaped mine with wide holes, expecting the holes to get smaller as in other recipes I've tried, but they never closed up.  After boiling, I put an egg white/water mix on top of some bagels and topped with various mixes.  On metal baking sheets with a convection oven, it took about 20 minutes to cook the bagels.  On a ceramic (I think) Pampered Chef pan, it took 25 minutes.  I can't get over how fast and easy these were!  Thanks for the recipe!

I divided the recipe in half. The dough takes time to come together, but it is a great dough to work. used kosher salt, also divided dough into 8 and balled it to rest for the first 15. I added a tsp. of baking soda in the boil water bath for a pretzel-like crust. balgels really fillout when boiled. Baked on parchment instead of greasing the sheet. although bland these are a great plain bagel for sandwiches, or addeding in flovoring ingredients before baking

This was my first attempt at bagels so cut recipe in half just in case! Recipe was very easy to follow. I like to use wheat flour so I mixed it with bread flour.... but didn't think there was much flavor to them. I will take these over store bought any day though!

Turned out perfectly! Made some with kosher salt on top, plain, and honey. Will definitely make this again.

Great flavour, but no rising throughout and very dense final result. Tasty. I’m curious whether instant yeast would’ve been more helpful than regular yeast?

These are great! I halved the recipe and made 8 instead of the recommended 12 (for half). I made them twice in a week as the whole family loves them. Couple of suggestions: make the hole in the middle about the size of the middle of a paper towel roll as when they rise it will become smaller. For my 2nd batch I kneeded cheese in it and sprinkled it on top. Both types are awesome
