This is fabulous!  I used canned tuna in olive oil instead of albacore because i do not have it here in Prague. It goes down great with a glass of white wine. What a wonderful, light, highly refreshing recipe.  thanks Christine :o)

Easy and quick to prepare. Tastes better chilled and served over your favorite lettuce.

felt this was a really weird combination of flavors, not at all a fan
