I was very pleased with this recipe. Nice and simple.  I left the potatoes a little lumpy when smashing because I didnt want a totally smooth soup.

It was too bland for me.  Ended up adding broccoli and cayenne, it helped a little.

I find this a great base for a hearty meal. We add just about anything you would add to a baked potato to the soup.

I thought this recipe was sort of bland, but made a good starting base.  I added some fresh sliced mushrooms, carrots for flavor and color, and some crumbled bacon.  The potatoes should be at least halved before cooking.  I also added about a tablespoon of dried dill, and a few sprinkles of cinnamon.  It was very good, thick and filling, but I don't think I would make this version again.

Although the recipe was pretty easy, we found it rather bland.  I added parsley, shredded cheese, more garlic powder, and about 6 strips of crumbled bacon.  It was do-able with that.  I won't fix this particular recipe again.  Sorry.

I made this in the crockpot because I knew I wouldn't have to cook once my extended family arrived one evening.  They loved it.  I left out the sour cream and chives, but it was delicious.  Thanks!

It was very watery. I feel the cooking techniques are not quite right for this type of recipe. I would not make again.

We enjoyed this and I will make it again.  I did make a few changes as I didn't have quiet as long as the recipe takes to make.  I boiled the potatoes in the 8 cups of water, then I reserved 4-5 cups of the potato liquid to add back later if needed.  I only used 8oz heavy whipping cream, saut√©ed some onions in 1 tbsp butter, added 1 tsp parsley flakes and adjusted the seasonings to taste.  I let it simmer for about an hour between 2-3 heat setting.  We like our potato soup thicker, so at the end I added back a little of the reserved liquid.
