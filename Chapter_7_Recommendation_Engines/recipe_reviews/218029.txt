Sangria and I had a very bad break-up in my early adulthood, so I approached this with caution.  I only had a taste of it at the Round Up, but what I had was delicious!  I'll definitely be making this in the comfort of my own home, where I can better monitor my intake and subsequent actions :-)

Served at the Midwest Round-Up in KC.  Perfect recipe, very refreshing.  According to the submitter, do use cabernet sauvignon, it doesn't have to be expensive, but a substitution may not taste the same.  Also use regular limes, not key limes since they may be bitter.  Better if you use flavored sparkling water.  All suggestions came directly from the submitter of the recipe.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Perfect sangria! This adds just enough fruit, so it still tastes like wine (some sangria recipes are almost fruit punch!) Although, I did cut down the brandy down to 1 cup. It's still pretty potent.

I love the honey in this recipe. Other Sangrias use sugar and can be too sweet.  This is a pretty drink so the kids asked if they could have some so I made them some grape juice with sparkling water, floated the fruit in it so they didm't feel left out.

I really enjoyed this sangria recipe.  We like our sangria a bit more sweet, so I just added more honey to the pitcher.  Thanks for sharing your husband's recipe, Cathy.  It was yummy!

This was good but a tad bit too potent for me. It could be because I had to use key limes (because it was all I had). When I added a lot of ice, it helped water it down a bit and was much better. In all, good flavor but will cut down on the brandy next time.

Magnolia Blossom made this at my roundup.  I merely watched but it is good.  And it is potent with the potential to be sneaky.  Thanks for the recipe!

If you are looking for the perfect drink for summer patio afternoons, look no further!  This is not only beautiful but fresh and delicious as well.  I am going to plan a gathering just to honor this drink!  I would suggest you do as I did---take little sips but often!  Yum!

The secret is out about the Myers Sangria :) I am buying an automatic juicer just for this drink! One suggestion I would say is to only use Cabernet, any other wine will taste a little differents.

Excellent Sangria!  We preferred to omit the sparkling water... the blended flavors were more pronounced, less diluted.

Love the idea of honey instead of simple syrup. But 1-1/2 cups of brandy and 1/2 cup of triple sec does not sneak up on you - it will kick you in the face. If you double the wine and honey it still tastes just fine.  Made a second time with blackberries, guava, and kiwi instead of oranges, lemons and limes, and agave nectar instead of honey, and was equally delicious

I must admit that my drink of choice is beer but I had the opportunity to taste this at the Viva Las Vegas 2012 AllRecipes Blowout. Wow, I'm hooked and will definitely make this for gatherings. Thank you Cathy Meyers!

We used good ingredients but the cabernet gave the drink a really harsh note no one liked.

This is a great 'basic' recipe. Since I just did some sangria drinking as part of our weekend spa ritual I thought I'd comment as someone who has had Sangria literally around the world. I would suggest Sangria is very personal as to how you make it. 

At one of the biggest squares in Madrid I had it served with apples and have seen many, many variaitions. So ... use the fruit you have and enjoy! ... and ... no, you don't need cabernet (unless that is the only red you love) ... use an inexpensive red if you like that red (all these fruit flavors will overtake the cabernet anyway) ... In my previous life as a restauranteur I sold so many pitchers of a red sangria (yes ... you can make great sangria with white wine if you prefer) that I was able to retire at a relatively young age! ... :-) ... In MY recipe brandy (a 2 count per pitcher) is an essential ... but no triple sec ... my extra special ingredient is a about a 2 count of coconut rum (per pitcher) ... :-0 ... along with cherry brandy (2 count per pitcher) ... no sugar or honey but I use agave nectar, about a 2 count per pitcher ... and lots of fruit ... oranges and limes are a must but feel free to add what YOU like! That is what people do all around the world with this wonderful elixir. (OK ... my super, super secret ingredient is ginger ale for the bubbles in this recipe). GLTA!

Traveled all of Spain, drank lots of Sangria and I can tell you that this is a very close imitation of the sangria in Spain. I used same recipe to make white sangria and it was just as tasty.

LOVED IT! We made this for my college graduation party for about 50 people (appx. 3.5 gallons) & it went over like butter. So smooth! I cut down on the lime and lemon juice by 1/6 each. Granted, I had planned on leaving the sangria all day in the sun, and I also garnished the container it was in with frozen cranberries. We also replaced the honey with agave nectar because it is less viscous. I also did a mix of half merlot and half cabernet savigon. I definitely think that this calls for a medium-dry wine because of all the fruit juice. When I added all cab-sav it was just a little too dry on thae palette for my taste. All ingredients were prepared the day before, save for the seltzer, which was added the day of. Even the guys were trying this!!

I made this for a Progressive dinner along with White Peach Sangria and it was very well received. Fresh juices and honey to sweeten it, what could be better?!?! I only added a quarter of brandy. I made quite a bit of both recipes and being that I prefer white Sangria, one of the guests said she would be more than happy to pick up any red leftover! And she did! Thanks, great recipe!
