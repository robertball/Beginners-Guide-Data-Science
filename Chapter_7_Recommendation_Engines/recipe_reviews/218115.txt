This is very good. However, to suit my taste, I had to make some changes ( I am a chocoholic ). I used ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips ( 60% cacao ), increase cocoa powder to 1/2 cup and put 1 tbs instant coffee powder ( next time I will try espresso powder or half cup of coffee ). The coffee really brought out the chocolate flavour.  I found this a little bit too sweet for me, next time I will reduce the sugar about 1/4 cup.

This was good, I used bread I had on hand, omitted the nutmeg. I found the chocolate taste to be light.

I am a chocolaholic and this was amazing, but a little too sweet.. I would reduce the amount of chocolate chips and sugar I put in next time. But an amazing sweet treat!

Very good! I made a few changes though. I omitted the nutmeg, vanilla & raisins and added 1 tsp of orange extract & 1 tsp of Grand Marinier. I substituted the 2 cups of sugar for 3/4 cup of Truvia. I love orange & chocolate together! Delicious!

Very pleased with the results.  I used a loaf of challah and, as others suggested, reduced sugar and cut the chocolate chips in 1/ 2.  I also had some heavy cream in the fridge so I used 1/2 cream and 1/2 milk. My husband doesn't do overtly rich desserts, and he went back for seconds.  Loved the textures of a crispy top with the soft raisins and bread. Pretty darn yum.

I found this decadent. Did what others suggested by reducing the sugar. Very yummy! Those who claimed they weren't a chocolate fan (as if that could even be possible) went back for seconds.

WOW!  This was an intense chocolate flavor and absolutely delicious.  I did halve the sugar per the other reviews and I'm glad I did - the chocolate chips gave it the right amount of sweetness. I also used 2% milk instead of whole to save some calories.  Note that the bread should be about 4 cups.  I learned from my last (disastrous)attempt at bread pudding and measured the bread as I cut it.  4.5 cups was equal to 3/4 of a baguette for me.  If I had used the whole loaf it would have been too dry. If you like chocolate this is a must try!

I made this for a family event and a year later my mom requested it for her birthday 'cake,' and I'm happy to oblige because I really like it as well.  She is hard to please.

I did this for the second time for a family occasion.  It is so good & rich.   I didn't have bittersweet, so I reduced the sugar a bit.  We're not fond of raisins, so I eliminated them.  It is so amazing.  Served warm with whipped cream.  Thanks!  We love this recipe!

This was really good, but maybe too rich, if that is even possible.  I did not use the raisins, but followed the recipe 100% otherwise.  I served it with real whipped cream.  worth making again, when I am really craving chocolate.

This was very good. My guests all loved it. I did halve the sugar because of previous reviews. I also left out the raisins, otherwise I followed the recipe. I will make this again using only 1 cup of sugar and otherwise following the recipe.

This was a perfect 'what to do with all those leftover crusts from the Thanksgiving stuffing' recipe! Instead of the French loaf, I used the crusts from pepperidge farm white bread. I left out the raisins. We were all concerned about the strong scent of cinnamon wafting from the oven, but it was not as overwhelming as expected. My hubby thought we should cut back on it a bit next time anyway. Overall it pleased 12 out of 12!
