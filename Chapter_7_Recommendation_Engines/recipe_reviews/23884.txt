I didn't find this recipe dry at all, and actually wonder if other reviewers continued to drain the meat after putting in the tomato, getting rid  of all the juice from the tomato thinking it was grease. I used a medium sized tomato, and drained off as much grease as possible before adding the tomato. After adding the tomato I ran off enough excess liquid to keep the pies from getting too sloppy, and the remaining juice was 90% from the tomato and flavored with all the great spices thrown into the meat. I did follow the advice of other reviewers and set the oven to 375, and cooked everything for about 20 minutes. I also ran out of pie before filling like other reviewers,  so next time I'm getting more pie dough or halfing the filling and just making enough for two people. Still, this recipe got a great response. My boyfriend says I have now hooked him on feta, and I thought the pie was really rich with the cayenne pepper and other seasoning coming through beautifully.

In normal allrecipes fashion, I altered this recipe quite a bit.  I doubled all the spices.  I used 1 can of tomatoes (liquid included) instead of 1 tomato.  I also added one beaten egg to the meat mixture to make it hold together more.  I added pine nuts and garlic.  I also put in 1/2 a can of tomato sauce to combat dryness.  I baked it all in a deep dish pie crust at 350 degrees for 1/2 an hour.  That made it a quick and easy supper.  I served it with a salad and asparagus on the side.  Delicious.

My husband loved this but I did make some important changes.  As one reviewer suggested,  I simply cut the two crusts into quarters.  This saved both time and dough.  Secondly, I doubled the spices (except for the red pepper).  Thirdly, after reading the reviews and discovering that I didn't have any tomatoes anyway, I substituted salsa for the tomato.  This worked out great - the pies weren't dry at all.  I added the salsa last so I just kept adding until the mixture had a good consistency.  I used at least a half-cup of salsa by the time I was done.  I also diced the small onion instead of just slicing it.  Finally, I added a small handful of grated cheddar to the top of each pie before putting on the upper crust.  While it's hardly necessary, I think that made them even better -- I love the combined taste of cheddar and pie crust.  I'll be making these again soon.  We have a lot of ground venison and this is a great way to use a pound.

I made this last night and we both loved it. I did as One  had suggested and added canned diced tomatoes with some juice to combat the dryness.   I  also use Pillsbury refrigerated pie crusts and cut them in quarters making the pies with thoes instead of cutting circles  No waste!!!  I will add black olives next time. also  I  found that the pies were brown after 18 mins so  I might lower the oven temp next time to 375 so the cheese gets a chance to melt more.

My husband and I love Greek food, and absolutely gobbled up this recipe! My hausband actually stopped eating, touched my arm and said, "Let me be clear about how much I love this!"  I used 3/4 of a can of diced tomatoes and lowered the temp to 375 as suggested in other reviews and it was plenty moist.  I used 3 cloves of garlic and ended up using 3 pie crusts but left everything else the same.  I think next time we may add cooked spinach to the pie. Quick, easy and delicious with a big green salad, thanks!

I made this as written, and it was just OK.  The flavor was alright, but it was a little too time consuming for the end result.

For me, these were too much effort for the results.  They turned out watery and did not showcase the feta very well.

I did not like this at all and neither did my family.  I made it exactly as written except I used a little less of the cayenne than it calls for but it wasn't good. Nothing in particular, just didn't like it at all.  Alot of work and not very good.

I was cleaning out the fridge and had everything but the ground beef for this. I decided to use sausage instead and it was great. I used canned tomatoes with a tiny bit of the juice. I was told by my husband that we can have it again (which means he liked it too).

I agree with most: this is an usual and savory pie. It is dry; I would use canned, diced tomatoes mostly drained, and I would lower the temp a bit and bake longer to melt the cheese better. But a fun and interesting dish!

I have made this for years and the whole family loves it. I just make one big pie and add a small can of tomato paste or sauce to help with the dryness. Yummy.

I thought that there was too much crust, way too much breading. The beef was flavorful, but dry. Just ok.

These were yummy!  I used canned tomatoes with onion and garlic like others suggested...drained a little and use about 3/4 of a can. The filling came out very tasty. My only complaint is that I ran out of pie crust before I ran out of filling, however that may be b/c I cut my 2 crusts into 4 wedges each, which made folding them a little awkward.

This was a definite hit.  To combat the 'dryness' that others had mentioned, I used a canned of diced tomatoes, slightly drained.  This worked well.  I also added sliced black olives and used greek seasoning.  I got asked when I was going to make this again!!

I love feta cheese, so I had to give this recipe a try. My husband looked awkwardly at it and kind of turned up his nose, but ended up taking the leftovers to work for lunch. I felt like I was making a gourmet meal! Thanks!

I had to give this a 4.  My ex-husband made it, and I didn't like it at all.(It's been about a year, catching up on my recipe box)  But when he took it to work, everyone just LOVED it, and he had to make it again, and take it to work the next week.

Excellent recipe and wonderful taste.  Time consuming because I made the crust by hand, but well worth the taste.  Also portions are quite large!

I really liked this recipe.  I took a hint from the others who cut their shells into four wedges, but only cut mine in half, then folded the half around the mixture.  This way you don't have to seal as many edges.  I had too much meat, so I only sealed the cut edge, and left the rounded edge open (too full to close it).  They held together long enough to get them on the plates, and that's the important part! :)

I used the canned tomatoes (Italian style) but I used too much of the juice, so had to scoop the meat mixture carefully to avoid sogginess.  I also had no cayene pepper so used a wee bit of Thai chili garlic sauce instead for a bit of spice.  I cooked it at 375 for 25 minutes as suggested to melt the cheese more, but I don't find that feta ever really melts.

All in all, very yummy!

Being a big fan of feta I was anxious to try this recipe.  I did as one of the previous people noted, and instead of cutting the pie crust in circles, I just quartered them, made little calzone looking pies.  I really liked this  recipe.  Very good, and looked pretty on the plate, nice to have something different for a change.  My husband, however, wasn't as crazy about them as I was.  I'll have to tweek it a bit to get it to where we both like it.   But all in all it was a big hit.  Thank you.

This recipe was excellent!  I am Greek, so instead of the spices that it called for, I added a dash of Greek Seasoning (which includes mint- very distinctive)!  I also made it into one large pie which worked out well.  I will be sure to make this again!

Made this last night & it was great!  My husband and I both enjoyed it. I used 2 refrigerated pie crusts and cut them into 4 wedges each instead of circles. It was faster and easier for me.  We had the leftovers for lunch today. Thanks Sarah B.  This one's a keeper!

Loved it...It could be a little dry, but I might add some more tomatoes next time.  Very delicious.  Any leftovers can be easily frozen.  Would be a great meal to serve for friends with a nice salad.....

This recipe was okay.  I found that the recommended amount of pie crust was understated, and that the dish was dry overall.  We had also made AMBER RAE'S CUCUMBER SALAD, and used some of the salad over the Feta Pie to help the dryness out - which made a very tasty combo.

My husband and I really loved the rich flavors of these pies.  Savory definitely  is a correct description.  This recipe will be good for company or a special meal for us.  I made the recipe for four and reheated two the next day in the microwave.
