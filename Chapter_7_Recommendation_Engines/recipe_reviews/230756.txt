I used a scant 1/2 cup and a really firm banana.  Kids devoured it.

A classic combination of flavors served quesadilla style. I enjoyed this very much; the only thing I would suggest is to cut back on the peanut butter a bit; I think it was just too much for one tortilla (especially because it gets gooey as the quesadilla heats up). Nonetheless, I loved every bite. Thanks for sharing!

This was a good breakfast. I made it in a whole wheat tortilla. I like banana and peanut butter together, but I think I still prefer them on a piece of toast best.

I never made any changes, I love simple and it was good.
I made them ahead of time and then cooked them.  My
friends love peanut butter and they were happy with change.
