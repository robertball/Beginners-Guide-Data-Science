I made this in the morning for a baby shower that was held in the evening.  The salad kept well and transported well (I filled the endive leaves before transporting).  Also, I used only about half of the dressing and mixed it in with the salad instead of drizzling it - turned out great.  I made the following changes and was happy with them: used only 1/4 cup olive oil; mixed half blue cheese with half goat cheese to cut down on the strong blue cheese flavor.  I think it was an attractive appetizer when arranged in a pretty way on a plate.

I served this at a party of over 50 people.  Much of the food choices were catered, but this was one of my own additions.  I used goat instead of gorgonzola but the result was just a delicious.  This one dish generated more compliments than all the catered foods.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  It will be a go-to for entertaining from now on.

I agree with the first review. There was way to much olive oil. I thought so as I put it in, should have followed my instincts. And much as I love Gorgonzola; flavor was too strong. I may make again with her suggestions, but not this holiday!

This was a huge hit at a party. I walked in and it was what everyone was going to first. I used pears from my tree! I did cut olive oil in half for dressing and only drizzled on enough to add flavor. I saved the rest of the dressing for later, but you could potentially cut the recipe in half and 1/4 the olive oil. I cut up the green onions and added them to the stuffing instead of using them as garnish.

I didn't have walnuts, so I used almonds.

I tossed the filling in he dressing as well and drizzled a bit more on top. Made only 1/4 of the dressing and still had some leftover. I used Dubliner cheese instead of blue. Also, used 2 heads of endive and choose the choice leaves.  Was easy to eat, crunchy and delicious. Seems like "girl food" but the guys enjoyed them as well.

I was in a hurry and didn't read all the reviews, but I naturally did what they suggested and made only half of the dressing and I used canola oil instead of olive oil because I wanted the taste to be lighter. I also modified it with what I had in my fridge, so I used an apple, candied pecans and blue cheese. It was still a hit and the maple dressing really adds a lot to the taste! Great way to have a low-carb and gluten free appetizer!
