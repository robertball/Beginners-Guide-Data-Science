I made this for Thanksgiving and it got mixed reviews. 

First off, I suggest maybe using the pre-bought carmel for sundaes as it was pretty difficult to drizzle the microwaved caramel before it hardened. 

Secondly, I got some comments that it was a bit too spicy and the crust was too hard to cut. I would consider cutting down the cinnamon and maybe the ginger in the filling. I would also probably add a bit of sugar to the crust, as I saw a ginger snap/butter crust recipe on the box of ginger snaps and they added sugar to it. It was a bit overwhelming for some. Also, I think it was too hard to cut because of the hardened caramel that you drizzle directly onto the crust. Be sparing with that. 

But it was good, Id make it again!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. My brother-in-law made another type of Pumpkin Cheesecake and I thought this one was much tastier. I thought the crust was great and not too hard.. Everyone could not believe how good this cake was.

This is a very quick & easy dessert to asseble. However, it did take quite a long time to set in the fridge. To quicken the process, I placed the pie in the freezer for aproximately 45 minutes. I also used a hot, clean knife to cut this gooey concoction. I did change the recipe a tad by adding pumpkin pie spice & little extra cinnamon in place of the ground cloves. I don't believe it hurt the end result.

Made this tonight for a Halloween party and it was a hit!  LOVED it...  I didn't have gingersnaps so I used graham crackers instead and it turned out great. I also used a few teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice (Trader Joe's) in lieu of the other spices. I will definitely be making this again!

I made this for thanksgiving, it was the favorite. I took the advice of another review and did a graham cracker crust which turned out to compliment it and actually added another half cup of the pumpkin (1 cup total) which made the sweet side not quite as overwhelming and took care of the spicy of the cinnamon. It turned out fantastic. Will be making this all of the time

I'm not a big fan of traditional pumpkin pie but this recipe knocked my socks off! Amazing! This pie is the prodigy of a cheesecake and  pumpkin pie, everyone loved it! I added crumbled cookies to the crust and drizzled caramel ice cream topping on the top. I decorated the top with pumpkin shaped gingerbread cookies.

This was delicious, creamy and still light.  I didn't want to bake a dessert, and I needed one I could make gluten free.  I used GF gingerbread cookie crumbs and they worked fine, but they tend to get soggy over time.  The filling is naturally GF; however I added extra (pumpkin pie) spice (about 1 tsp.) and I did not use the caramel -- I thought it would be sweet enough without it.  I also did not top it with whipped cream; it just didn't need it and I think it even hid the pumpkin cream cheese flavor.  I will definitely be making this again.  Yum!
