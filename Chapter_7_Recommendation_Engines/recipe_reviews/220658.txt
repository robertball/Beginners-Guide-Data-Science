Really good. I am trying to incorporate more bean dishes into my families diet and this was a hit for me. First time I've tried homemade bean burgers and I was pleasantly surprised. I omitted the liquid smoke because I didn't have any, cut down the cumin and chili power to 2 teaspoons each and omitted the ranch dressing mix altogether because I'm not a fan of prepackaged junk and they were still delicious and flavorful.

Stumbled onto this recipe while looking for a black bean burger with a little more flavor.  Although I did make a few changes (everyone does!), this is a wonderful recipe! 

First, I smashed my beans rather than using a processor. I prefer the texture this way. 
I omitted the liquid smoke as I'm not a fan. Instead, I reserved some of the juice from the beans. I added about 1/8 cup to the mixture for consistency. 

I also substituted panko for bread crumbs, and cut that back to a cup. 

Lastly, I cooked and added a 1/4 c. quinoa.  My jalape単o and onion were cooked with the quinoa, then cooled for a bit before adding to mixture. 

I had no trouble at all forming these into patties- great consistency. I chilled the mixture in the fridge for about ten minutes while I put my daughter to bed- but it was not necessary to chill.

I have tried about 10 homemade veggie burger recipes that all had good flavor but fell apart because they were too soft/liquidy.  This is the first one i've tried that the burger holds together well and it has good flavor.  I will keep this recipe handy.

WOW!  Delicious.  Didn't mince the jalapeno, just de-stemmed one and threw it into the food processor whole with the beans.  Took substantially longer to cook until no longer a mushy mess, but that's not a big deal.  Used yellow pepper because that's what I had on hand.  Will most definitely make again.

Really tasty!  I didn 't have any jalape単os so I used  2 chipotles in adobo sauce...(2 peppers out of the can).  The "burgers"  were VERY spicy, but really good.  They were hard to make into patties because they were so moist. Next time I will try and dry the beans a little because I think that will help them stick together better.  My husband really liked them so this recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe and omitted the ranch because I didn't have any,  I love black bean burgers but don't care for pre-made. So I make the beans from scratch and follow the recipe as listed.  I freeze them to have on hand for when I don't have time to cook.  They turn out GREAT!

Ok so I made these a few times and I think I found the key to getting the right consistency.  I put the beans in a colander and let them sit and drain until all the liquid was out of them.  I made the recipe as stated which has very good flavor and just enough spice.  I only use one jalepeno since one time I used two and it was too spicy.  Also fresh garlic, not from the jar as this adds more liquid.

Out of this world! Modified slightly, omitting the ranch and cutting back on liquid smoke as trying to cut back processed stuff. Added a bit of seasalt. Wow, what a yummy burger. Plenty of flavor and held together nicely through cooking. Will make these often.

These really are the perfect black bean burgers. Have tried other recipes but this one sticks together very well, and is a hearty meal. I did not use liquid smoke, and used a half of an onion. The Jalapeno makes these great, use a whole pepper.

Liked this recipe a lot, although i did cut back the jalape単o to one ,but found that it wasn't  spicy enough so ill add the extra jalape単o next time. Also, i think the liquid smoke is a little to much for this recipe , it has plenty of flavors going on in there without the liquid smoke. Also i used blue cheese instead of gouda because i had black bean burgers at restaurant with it and it was good so i used that. One more thing find some artisan style buns or fresh baked buns they make a big difference in the texture i think.

These were really good. The texture worked out well. I used Colby jack cheese and topped with avocado, tomato, sriracha mayo, and a sprinkle of crushed tortilla chips to give it a little texture.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I thought it was way too much liquid smoke. I used about 1/2 of what was called for and still found it slightly overpowering. A good recipe overall though. I'd make it again.

Not a bad recipe.  I'm not a big fan of "smoked" foods, but I thought I would try this anyway with the plan of cutting back on the smokiness of it.  I just added 1/4 of the measurement suggested for the liquid smoke and got regular gouda instead of smoked gouda.  I am glad I did, because it turned out just right.  It was noticeably "smoked" without it being overwhelming.  If I had put in the full suggested amount of liquid smoke and added smoked gouda to it like the recipe suggested, I don't think I would have like it.  I made my own bread crumbs with some "light" bread for higher fiber and fewer calories, and I found that I could form the patties without having to freeze them for an hour.  Otherwise, this is a decent recipe.

Although these weren't bad, I didn't care for the texture of the patty. I used Gouda chesse per the instructions, but it got lost somewhere between the texture and spices. Next time I use beans to replace a protein I will make bean and cheese quesdilla's. Less prep time and less dishes.

Fantastic recipe.  If it's not thick while stirring in the last phase when you add the bread crumbs, add a little more until its thick enough to make balls.

Love this recipe! It has such good flavor. I did cut the chili powder and cumin down to 1 tablespoon each. I was afraid it would be over powering otherwise.
