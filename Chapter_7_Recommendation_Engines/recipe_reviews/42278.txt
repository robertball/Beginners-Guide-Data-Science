Yummy! Just what I was looking for. I made this today and I changed it up a bit. I used 1 can of crab meat since this was for 2 people. I boiled the asparagus for 1 min and let it sit for a few more in the hot water, as I like mine crispy. I sauteed the crab meat and asparagus with a tbsp of butter and seasoned it with kosher salt, pepper (to my taste) & added 1 tbsp of minced chives. I also used the Kirkland brand egg beaters as it is already seasoned and delicious.I also like the McCormick brand Hollandaise Sauce and add in a tbsp of lemon juice. I will definitely make this again!

What an elegant combo of flavors, minus the "FAKE" crab.
Sustitute the real stuff and my wife loves this stuff. Highly recommended!

Yum!!  This was the first time that I had ever made an omelet before and it was so easy and Soooooo delicious!  The combination of flavors going on...the best omelet I have ever had!  And the sauce and a perfect addition.

Fantastic!  I made my own hollandaise sauce using the "Southern Hollandaise Sauce" recipe from this site.  I also used real crab and would not recommend using imitation crab unless you really like it or know your guests like it.  I'm thinking this would also be good using Swiss or even Parmesan cheese---will have to wait until next time.

These are amazing.  I made it just like written, except I used real crab, because thats what I had leftover, and if you can afford it, its totally worth it!  This makes huge omelets!  I made 3 out of this recipe, and they were still almost too big (but soooo good!)
