This recipe was really good! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I can't think of an easy way to skin drumsticks! I'm on a high proten, low carb diet & this recipe was just what I needed! I  substitued honey for the Splenda & I couldn't find garlic chili sauce so I just bought regular & added a few cloves of minced garlic. It was still good. I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

These were borderline too spicy for me, but very good! I did use 'I can't Believe It's Not Butter" spray in lieu of the butter (0 calories), but evenso, the website that I use to track my calories clocked this at 260 calories per 2- leg serving. I am not sure where the discrepancy is. Next time, I will use less hot sauce, and omit the Splenda because I do not feel it needs it. But overall, good recipe! Thanks!

Awesome! I used sweet chili sauce and Tapatio hot sauce because I didn't have the recommended, but it still came out amazing! For sure a keeper.

It is super spicy hot so you have to love hot foods, but its really good though. I did use regular sugar though and cooked boneless chicken tenders instead and put it on "Quick Chinese-Style Vermicelli" which is  on this website as well and has some reviews as being bland but really good. It's not bland with this chicken on top.

These were a big hit in my house. My bf thought it wouldnt be so great since I skinned the legs but he was very impressed. We love our food hot and spicy and this is a nice, quick semi healthy supper

Excellent.  For the one who did not know how to skin chicken legs:  Pull the skin by hand as far to the end of the bone as you can on all the drumsticks.  Take 1-2 paper towels, grab the skin right at the edge of the bone while using the paper towels to hold it.  Pull, and if you do so slow, strong, and steadily, the skin comes right off.  :)

Very good and very hot!  I followed the recipe except sprinkled the chicken with granulated garlic before adding the sauce.  I used my favorite hot sauce, Franks.  I think next time I will use more of the Franks sauce and less of the chili garlic sauce.  I dusted off my electric skillet for this and worked perfectly, giving the chicken an nice gummy HOT coating.  Of course it took longer to cook than listed, chicken usually does if you like it well done.  Great Recipe!

I am really happy with this recipe.  It was so easy, healthy(ish), and delicious.  I made a half batch but forgot to halve the sugar.  It was still very good.  I mixed the legs with a little Accent, garlic, and onion powder about three hours before cooking.  I also used bacon fat to brown the chicken.  My picky boyfriend gave this the thumbs-up and I'll definitely be making it again.

I was looking for a delicious low carb chicken recipe and this one hit the mark! The sauce is very good and so easy to make. It is spicy so watch out if you don't handle spice well. I did season the chicken legs with onion powder, garlic powder, fresh black pepper, and paprika before I fried it in butter. This is also how I season my buffalo wings. I didn't like how unevenly the chicken was cooking in the sauce on the stove so I ended up popping it in the oven to finish. Next time I'll just brown the chicken and put it right in the oven with the sauce.

Mine weren't very spicy, but they were tasty. I had to cook longer than indicated in the recipe and I covered the pan. I found out the longer they cook, the stickier the sauce gets. Made these for the super bowl, I wish they were spicier.

WOW! That's spicy! I love spicy foods, and I used Sriracha and Louisiana hot sauce. Yummy! Chicken was falling off the bone! Be sure you have plenty of napkins and water! Loved it, and I don't feel guilty. Thanks for the recipe!

So good! Not too spicy at all, just right.  Probably could use more spice depending on the audience.  I halved the sweetener and it was perfect.  Just personal preference on sweet meats.  I baked it on 325 for over an hour, so tender.  Did not want to add fat by frying it up, so just the sauce over the legs in the oven!  Delicious~~

Update - I have made this recipe at least 5 times now, as written minus the sweetener.  I love spicy food and I love this recipe more every time I make it!  Definitely very spicy!  I love the simplicity of this one, and have used boneless chicken breasts, as well as legs.  Few ingredients, quick and easy prep and cooking, and amazing flavor!  Definitely a winner!

I had to improvise on the hot sauce since I didn't have the ones listed in the recipe. I used 1 cup siracha sauce and a habanero hot sauce. I made this for dinner tonight and it was a hit with the sweetheart and our kiddo. They both like spicy, the hotter the better for them.  The recipe was really easy to follow and it didn't take a long time to make. I will definitely make this again.

Only had a sample of the finished product.Such an alternative to hot wings which my family loves, and we have health issues... So thanks much for this recipe....I plan to use it more for spice night!!! Instead of using chili garlic sauce I used minced garlic and cayenne pepper mixed together and yes I used the WalMart version of Splenda and margarine instead of butter and my local Fiesta grocer brand hot sauce...

I loved the flavour of this dish, had just the right amount of kick for my taste. However my issue with this is the way in which the chicken is cooked. Trying to make sure the chicken is cooked and that the sauce doesn't burn wasn't possible for me. I'll try this in the oven next time, hopefully the flavour will be the same.

Tip for taking off the skin of drumsticks: Grab skin at the thigh end with a paper towel and pull down to the foot. So easy to make skinless. Fixed this for dinner tonight, wow! At first I thought it was going to be to hot when I tasted the mix, but it mellowed when cooking. I was hot but in a good way. Husband wants to try with Sriracha sauce and adding garlic (he doesn't like so many pepper seeds). I liked it as it is. We used a Picante Bufalo for  hot sauce. Loved this recipe and will do again. Thanks!

I loved this dish, and it wasn't as hot as I thought it would be considering it had a whole bottle of hot sauce in it.  The chicken took longer than the directions stated to cook, and the sauce never got really thick and sticky.  But it was so yummy, especially with ranch and blue cheese.  I will definitely make this again and experiment with different hot sauces.  Maybe those of you who love heat should try a mango habanero.
