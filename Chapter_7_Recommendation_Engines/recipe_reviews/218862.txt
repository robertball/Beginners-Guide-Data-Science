Made these for a party last night and everyone raved about them!  I used regular white mushrooms and really stuffed them full and mounded.  Delicious and they are my new favorite hors d' oeuvre!

I only used 1/2 the sausage and it was still to much for my liking.  These were good, but will do more cheese, less sausage next time. Big hit.

Very good! I made them as a main course with large portobellos. Since I had so much crab left I didn't use the shrimp. It was a bit much as a main dish but I will def make again just as an appetizer.

I have to say there is too much going on in this recipe.  The Italian Sausage overpowers the seafood.

Made this numerous times and have never had a complaint, I've even been told these are better than Red Lobster's stuffed mushrooms. The only change I make is white mushrooms, but I don't like portobellos.

I was looking for a recipe to use on large portobello mushrooms and this was excellent. Titis recipe stuffed 3 large ones to the point 2'of them flatten once they got moist from cooking. May have hollowed out too much. I will have to play around with that but still yummy. Minor changes is I used 8 oz container of crab and 8 oz package of salad shrimp. I did not blend the ingredients like the directions called for, I just mixed the times together real good keeping the shrimp whole. I took other reviews advice pre-cooked the sausage and used a little less sausage. In the mix.  I cooked it for about 25 min to thoroughly heat through. Since sausage is cooked, no need to worry about getting to 160 degrees.

Although we enjoyed this, the filling was overcooked by the time it reached 160.  Next time I will pre-cook sausage so it doesn't have to go in the oven so long.  Other than that, great recipe!
