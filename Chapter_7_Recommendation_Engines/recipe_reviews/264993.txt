This was good and I liked it so I am giving it 4 stars but I do have one big complaint. I have young hens that have just started laying and their eggs are small. I purposely chose their eggs to make this. Even by doing so, I had to gut the avocado way too much to get the whole egg to fit in. For a normal size egg you'd basically only have the shell of the avocado left. Unless you have something in mind for the majority of the avocado you've scooped out, there is a lot of waste.

Better be absolutely sure that you like hot avocado before wasting your expensive ingredients on this recipe. The flavor changes, the texture changes, and for me it was totally disgusting. I tossed it all after the first two bites and couldn't get the taste out of my mouth fast enough.

I agree with the other reviews. Unless you have a super large avocado or a super small egg, the excess egg will spill out.  I put mine in a small baking dish which caught all of the excess.  I baked according to the instructions & everything turned out delicious.  I will definitely be making this again.

I agree with the other reviews that you have to scoop out too much avocado to fit a regular size egg, but the taste was still delicious. And i love raw avocado, so it's not a total waste. 
However, and i know it's a little bourgeoisie, but I tried it with quail eggs and it was amazing. Their egg is much smaller and fattier than a chickens so it worked perfect. Due to the price I wouldn't recommend it for everyone. I just happen to have a few quails that law eggs for me.

I have a suggestion for the egg not fitting in the avocado.  Scoop out all (or most) of avocado so the egg will fit the shell.  Use the scooped out avocado to make your favorite avocado toast recipe to accompany the " baked in the shell" egg.

I ended up draining off a little of the egg white so I wouldnâ€™t loose to much avocado. Will totally make again with a few more tweaks :)
