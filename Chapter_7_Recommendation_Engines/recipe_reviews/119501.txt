I layered the ingredients for this in a 9x13 baking dish for about an hour. I did sprinkle a tbsp. of lemon juice with the apples before adding it to the rest of the ingredients. I also used eight Aidell's Chicken/Apple sausages, which I sliced into large circles. I served this with Diane's Colcannon. Very good. I'll make this again for sure.

I make this recipe directly from the Taste of Home magazine I have it from. We like to precook our onions with the sausage, then separate the sausages out and continue cooking the onions some more as we prefer a softer onion. It's very good, and a neat way to get rid of both apples AND link sausages (which can be tricky if you don't want brekkie!)

I made this for 375 women this weekend for our ladies Christmas Tea.  This was so good and I've gotten rave reviews.  I did reduce the amount of onion to about 1/2 and found it a little too soupy.  I strained the apples out after cooking and reduced the cooking liquid down to a more syrupy consistency.  I also used turkey sausage links.

This recipe is great! My whole family loved it. However I made it for dinner and canged the preparation just a little. First i cooked the sausage. Then, took them out and cooked the onions in the same pan. After the onions were soft I put the suasage back in and broke it up into pieces. After it was all in small bite sized peices I added the apples. I then put them in a 13x9 Baking dish I had already layered some precooked sliced potatoes with salt and pepper. I added the water and brown sugar and baked about 30 min. SOOO GOOD!! Thanks for sharing this! Its one of our new favorites!!

Delicious! My husband at first thought that mixing apples and onions was weird, but he's requested it multiple times.

This was really good.  I used bulk sausage instead of link sausage and it was fine.

I made this for a beer breakfast in the spring.  If the reaction of the guests and the empty casserole dish is any indication this recipe is a winner just as it is written.
I am making it again today for a July 4th family brunch.
