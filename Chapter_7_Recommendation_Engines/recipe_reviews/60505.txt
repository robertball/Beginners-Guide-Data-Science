I absolutely love this recipie.  I have had nothing but compliments on this appetizer.  I have made is multiple times and they always go quick.  The secret to making them taste great is all in the brand of cocktail sauce and crab meat you use.  I have made them with generic cocktail sauce and crab meat and was not to trilled with the taste.  Use KRAFT cocktail sauce, it's the best.  Like I say some imitation crab meat tastes better than others, you just have to find a good brand that doesn't taste too fishy and I have found plenty of them.  I have also substituted other kinds of cheese and they still taste great.  Enjoy!

Awesome!! I served this at a shower. I used 8 oz bag of frozen salad shrimp (defrosted) instead of crab meat b/c I'm skeptical of imitation crab. Omitted the onions b/c not everyone likes them. I got many compliments. Will serve again.

I made these roll ups at my daughters birthday party. Everyone liked them. The only thing the said it needed was a little more Cocktail Sauce.

I doubled the recipe, used good lump crab meat and added horseradish to the cocktail sauce for dipping. Excellent, everybody loved it. Some had standard cocktail sauce and still enjoyed it.

Why use imitation, ruines the recipe(in my opinion). Go for the Dungeness.

Yummy!  Everyone loved these. The best part is that they are so easy to make but look like they were a lot of work. Some thought they were store-bought.

For the most part I think this is pretty good but I am not a fan of cocktail sauce.  So I only put half the needed amount.  I thought that made a difference.  Absolutly worth making again.  Enjoy

I wanted to put an Asian twist on these, so I completely left out the cocktail sauce & instead added a couple of dashes of Soy sauce to the cream cheese, added a clove of garlic(pressed) & served w/ Sweet & Sour sauce! You will love this version if you love Crab Rangoon, and it's MUCH healthier! Thanks for a great basic recipe, next time I'll try what the recipe calls for, it sounds delicious either way!

Made these for a picnic yesterday and they were delicious.  Prepared too many so a retired teacher (wonderful chef) took home the remainder to serve at his fancy sit-down dinner at home today.

I made this for my annual Christmas party, and wow was it a hit!  I am glad that I had doubled the recipe, as it still didn't last the entire evening. It is so easy to make, and can be prepared ahead of time!

I used real lump crab meat because I don't like the imitation.  I didn't put it in tortillas because I was taking it to a party in just a couple hours and didn't have time to chill the rolls.  I served with Triscuits, but next time I would serve with tortilla chips.  It was good, but not great.  I'll make it again and put it in the tortillas or with chips.  I added a little more cocktail sauce and some Tobasco too... not bad!

I love this recipe. I have used it countless times for parties and always received rave reviews while they disappeared before my eyes! A couple of notes - I accidentally left out the swiss cheese the last time I made them and they were still delicious. Also, I usually use larger tortillas and just keep spreading and rolling them until the filling runs out. And if you are in a hurry, you can always stick them in the freezer for a short bit for them to harden before cutting and serving. Try them - you won't be disappointed!

This I felt as well as my 3 girls...we liked it. Hubby and Son...not so much. I followed the recipe to a T and doubled the recipe. The only thing myself and my oldest felt it needed a little more of a umph..with a kick of spice. So I added 1/4th cup more the cocktail sauce and that hit the nail on the pinata'...But as written...it's a good recipe. Great for appies for a party. Thank you.

Yummy and easy to make Can't go wrong! The recipe is good as stands with no need to change ingredients. I agree with using quality ingredients with anything. You get the taste of quality when you use quality. I like these with spinach wraps also and changing cheese to your taste. Nice appetizer.

I made these for some foreign visitors to highlight some tasty blue crabs and they loved them.
Needless to say, I used real crab meat instead of the imitation stuff.

These were pretty good but thought 1/4 cup of cocktail sauce was a bit much for our taste.  I will cut the coctail sauce in half next time and am going to make them as fried wontons; I just think the ingredients will be even better if hot.

My boyfriend and I made these for our new years eve party.  We used a mild white cheese with dill, I forget what cheese exactly.  The dill was a great compliment.  We also used a pretty spicy cocktail sauce so that added a ton of favor to it.  These were a big hit and none survived.  These are great for any party!  I will certainly make these again.

I made these for a July 4th party and they were gone within minutes! Everyone loved them. I did add some freshly squeezed lemon juice to tone down any "fishy" taste that there might have been. Very good and I highly recommend them!

This recipe was great! I served this for a family get together. I had a variety of foods out and these were the first to go. Now I am always asked to bring these to other social events, big hit. Also everyone loves them dipped in the seafood sauce. Thanks Kate.

This was an excellent recipe, Kate.  Thank you so much.  I served this at my candle party and the women loved it.  My husband and his crew at work enjoyed the leftovers also.  I made the recipe exactly as it read.  GREAT AS IS!!!

These were quite a hit on Christmas day!  I would possibly use more crab next time just because I like it's flavor.

This is so easy to make and tastes so good!!  I substitued mozzarella chesse for the swiss because of personal preference and it tasted great.  Used the dip in a tortilla but will also use it a spread!!  This a great and easy appetizer!

Delicious. I did not use quite as much cocktail sauce and added about 1/4 cup of chopped black olives. Also my recipe yielded 5 tortillas.

This is another super easy and quick appetizer to put together and always a crowd-pleaser for me at parties. Every time I make these, they quickly disappear. I've never served them with the extra sauce for dipping b/c they're pretty tangy without dipping them in a sauce. They're fun and cute finger foods that everybody loves!

This makes a better dip then anything else.  My co-workers loved it just as a dip with crackers.  It didn't the the same reviews when in the roll-up form.  I added the extra cocktail sauce right into the mix-it needed the extra spice in my opinion.  Overall, very good and I will be making it again!

I made these for a party and thought they were just "ok."  I used less cocktail sauce than it called for and wished I had used even less.  It overpowered the taste of the crabmeat.  There were some at the party who absolutely loved them, but most thought they were only ok.

I made these last night when we had people over.  I made them the way the recipe called for and also the way ARMYWIFE99 suggested making them and my husband liked them better that way.  He said they were awesome when you dipped them in the sweet and sour sauce.  I will probably make these again because they went over really well.

The imitation crabmeat as the recipe suggests would have been better, but the flavor combination of the cocktail sauce and the cream cheese was pretty strange in and of itself. I wanted to use real crab, but couldn't afford fresh, so I used canned crab and the rolls were pretty aweful. I doubt I'd try this again--even with the imitation crab meat. This just wasn't how I like my crab prepared, but I tried it because of all the rave reviews. I should have stuck to my own preferences.

These went quick!! I used tiny shrimp and crab. They remind me of crab rangoons that you get at Chinese.  I took some of the leftover mixture and made an enchilada out of it. A quick heat in the microwave and it was a creamy delight!

I made these for a "spa treatment" day for my sisters and we all liked them. They were a tad bit bland for me though, but it may have been my brand of cocktail sauce. Just a touch of some seasoning salt helped a lot. Will certainly make again with a different sauce this time. :-)

Sorry Kate Marie, this one was not a hit at my gathering.  The ingredients didn't compliment each other.  I ended up using another recipe "Crab Dip II" Submitted by Angela to which I added a little mayo and flaked tuna, then rolled them in tortillas.  Everyone preferred the crab dip rolls over this recipe.

This didn't get any good comments; and I had almost all of them left by the end of the night.  The tortillas got very gummy, and I think that took away from the dish.  Probably will not make again.

Not a fan of the cocktail sauce additive. And to soggy to eat next day.

Quick and easy. Very good. Did not need the additional cocktail sauce for dipping.

This was an outstanding appetizer.  I took it to an annual holiday dinner and it was a huge success.  Everyone loved it and I will be making this one again I’m sure!  I substituted small salad shrimp for the crab and used spinach tortillas but otherwise recipe the same.

I was looking for a new crab dish and found this, it was awesome and a big a hit at a party I went to.  I wasn't able to wrap it quite tight enough but I'm sure with practice I'll get it. thank you for the great idea

Sooooo good. I didn't have cocktail sauce so I used Old Bay seasoning, chili sauce, and sriracha to substitute. Yum!

A great recipe.  I substituted a 1/4cup of Soy and Teriyaki sauce mixed together, for the cocktail sauce, and it came out excellent.

I'm going to go ahead and give this 5 stars just because it sounds great and is so easy but I'm going to do what everyone hates - add something - one person mentioned it needed a little kick - what about a pinch of Old Bay seasoning?  Will be making for a small party this week  - and of course you have to use real crabmeat!

These were good but a bit bland.  I think if I made them again I would add finely chopped sweet pickle.

These were a hit at my uncles 80th bday party.  I did increase the cocktail sauce to 1/3 cup but still thought it could use more.  I am going to make them again to take to a 4th of July picnic and increase the cocktail sauce to 1/2 cup, I am just concerned that it may make the spread too liquidy.  I will come back again and give my opinion on that.  Also I used sun dried tomato tortilla's.  Very good.

This was so disappointing. I made as the recipe stated, but very very boring.  Rolling these up were a disaster.  The roll broke before I got done and the filling fell out.  
  No need to make again.

These were so easy to make and tasted great.  I brought them to a bridal shower and they disappeared.  I can't remember the brand of tortillas I bought but they were too thick and bready- stick to something thin.

These didn't go very fast.  I liked them and everyone else 'said' they liked them but the fact remains that there were more than a few left over after the party.

On Christmas Eve we have a large spread of appetizers rather than a sit down dinner, trying a couple of new recipes every year. I gave this a shot and everyone, including my non-seafood loving husband really enjoyed these. 
Thanks for sharing!

This was just "ok".  It was a little on the dull side for me - maybe real crab would taste better?  And when I got it out of the fridge, the tortillas were soggy - not sure what I did wrong.  Wasn't bad as long as I used the cocktail sauce for dipping.

These had potential, but mine turned out a little bland.  Maybe it was the kind of cocktail sauce that I used, but they needed a little more kick and were too sweet for my taste.   I took them too a party and people ate a few of them, but no one raved.

I took this to a gathering and they sat all night long.  People had one serving and that was it - no seconds for them.  I like crabmeat and cocktail sauce, but these flavors didn't go together at all.  Sorry.

Wow..... was this a hit at our family reunion. This was by far the most requested recipe there. I made it with the roll ups and them made a separate batch for spread on crackers, leaving out the cheese. This was awesome...a real keeper. Thanks for the post Kate Marie
