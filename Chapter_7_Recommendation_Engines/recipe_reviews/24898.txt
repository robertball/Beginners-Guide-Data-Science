This recipe has potential. The cheese/egg/bread crumb breading was delicious and the chicken turned out very very tender. However, I would recommend using a drier wine (like chardonnay or other white) instead of white zin as the sauce was a bit too sweet. Or I might mix half wine with half chicken broth. I also added a lot of garlic and extra mushrooms which helped. I didn't add the full 3 cups of cheese as I thought that was excessive. I would also recommend adding a bit of cornstarch or cooking the mushroom/wine sauce for 10-15 minutes to let it thicken, and possibly adding some chicken boullion for flavor.

I just wanted to say that I made this dish and found the flavor to be terrible, so this is a warning to people who don't like white wine, YOU WILL NOT LIKE THE FLAVOR OF THE CHICKEN.  Other than that, it was easy and the chicken was very juicy.

This recipe is pretty good.I have one sugestion which add the wine and mushroom sauce after cooking because the sauce makes breaded items suggy or add one third first and add rest of it later.thank you.

My husband and I just loved this recipe.  We don't drink Zinfandel, so used Chardonnay.  Will definitely have this on a regular basis.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I made enough to send to a couple who frequently shares prepared food with us. I was confident that they would like this dish after my husband and I had the first portions of the recipe. It is a winner!
I followed the recipe - except that I used 6 good sized pieces fo chicken. I put 3 peices each into 2 baking dishes and had enough to share with my neighbors. *** This note was added after I made this dish the second time. The first time I made this was great...the second time mine came out soggy as others have mentioned...I believe I got over-confident maybe used too much liquid, or I had juicier chicken and mushrooms - so I would recommend cutting the liquids a bit.  (You can always add more if your dish appears to be on the dry side when you check it, but heat the liquids in the microwave before adding so that you don't slow your cooking process.)

Very good and easy. A nice twist on the usual  baked chicken. Texture and flavor were lovely,  I would make two changes. Next time, garlic bread crumbs,  and sauteed onions (or garlic) or both along with the mushrooms. A bit of extra kick would make this satisfying dish even more impressive. Thanks!

Very nice flavor. I only used one cup of wine - I used Chardonnay instead of the Zinfandel, thought the Zin would be too sweet.  This was very nice and very flavorful

My favorite baked chicken recipe so far! Great flavor and so tender! Using another reviewers advice I halved the amount of wine, then when spooning the wine sauce over the chicken I didn't pour the remaining sauce over the chicken...and the chicken didn't seem soggy. As a tip be sure to use a spatula to turn the chicken over in the pan. I was lazy and just used a fork on the first one and the breading stuck to the pan. After that I used a spatula and it worked perfectly! A+++

It was excellent.  I will try to see if I can change it so it maybe is a little lower in fat (the 3 tablespoons of oil did not cut it for browning the chicken and keeping the bread crumb mixture on it, so we had to use more), but it was excellent.  Will make this again

I thought that the breading was really great, but the dish was so soggy when it came out.  I wish I could find something like this, just with not so much liquid.  It tasted pretty good besides being soggy.

Absolutely delicious!  I made it exactly according to the recipe and loved it.  I stored the leftover chicken with the angel hair pasta, and the flavor of the wine sauce nicely marinated the pasta for another great meal the next day.

This was a really delicious recipe and wasn't difficult at all. I used white chardonney 
and it still was great.

This chicken is delicious!  Everyone loved it.  My mother even asked for the recipe to make for herself several days later.  I will definitely make this one again!

Too sweet!!  It needs a drier wine and I'd suggest one cup rather than two.

This was really tasty. I gave it a 4 because of the sogginess. I did read the reviews and cut back on the liquid to one cup but of course it was still soggy. That being said, it had a great flavor and my family of 6 gobbled it up! I mixed chicken broth with the wine. Next time I'll probably cook the chicken without the wine sauce but thicken it a bit and use it as a gravy. Great recipe - thanks!

Good Recipe.  Very easy to make.  My only aleration would be to use less wine.  The jack cheese brings out the acidity in the wine.  Also, if I were to use a drier wine, I'm sure it would turn out a million times better.  
Goes great with Italian Herb Angel Hair Pasta and a green veggie (I like green beans)

This dish was OK. My friend made it for me a while ago. Hers tasted much better & was WAY more appealing to look at than mine was :)  My chicken seemed "soggy" (maybe from accidentally adding too much wine). Served with a side of Parmesan noodles (i.e. Lipton package mix) and fresh steamed asparagus. I don't think I'll make this again, but don't dislike it enough to not eat it if my friend made it for me :)  Even though I HATE mushrooms, this was OK (I just picked around them). Thanks anyways!

Awesome flavor, didn't have fresh mushrooms at home though, so I substituted cream of mushroom soup, very creamy. Yum.

Very bland!  I followed a previous suggestion and cooked the mushrooms in the wine for 15 minutes until the recommended 5.  The chicken turned out very tender but no flavor and it was really soggy.  I'm not sure if pouring the wine over the chicken before baking is such a good idea.  I also think you could use any white wine.

I gave this recipe four stars because my guests loved it.  I thought it was lacking flavor. I added fresh garlic and mushrooms and used Chardonnay wine.

My family raved about it. The only change was - I used gruyere cheese, only because that is what was on hand. They want to try it with the monteray jack. This is on our winners list.

Fantastic!  I also added chopped onion to the mushrooms.  Also, instead of shredding the cheese, I just sliced it about 1/4 inch thick and put it on top of each chicken breast.  Turned out great, and will be making it again for sure!!!

Excellent!  My two-year-old even loved it, and that's the ultimate stamp of approval.  I added butter to the mushrooms before I put the wine in for more flavor.  Fantastic recipe.

I have made this recipe several times, and it is always a hit.  My husband calls it "yummy chicken".  I serve it with the angel hair pasta coated in butter, garlic, and parm. cheese.  It has become a monthly meal.

This recipe was easy and tasted great.  I added sauteed onions and used a blend of cheddar and monterey jack cheeses and thought it was delicious--definitely worth keeping.

This was absolutely delicious!  I served it with rice and my boyfriend, who doesn't usually like chicken dishes, loved it -- he went back for seconds!  My mods: I added onion and used a combination of shredded Monteray Jack and shredded Cheddar cheese.  Super recipe!

WOW is about all I can say, this dish is so good. My whole family raved about it. I served over angel hair pasta and only used 1 1/2 cups of wine, drank the other 1/2 cup..lol.  Next time will try a little fresh garlic also. yummy!!!

I only used half the Monterey Jack cheese the recipe called for.  I have served this to company & it was quite a success!
