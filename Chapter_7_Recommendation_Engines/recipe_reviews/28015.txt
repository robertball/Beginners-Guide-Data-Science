I have made this twice and as written it is too salty and with the skin it is way too greasy for me. But it is called greasy chicken. Tonight I took the skin off, cut the butter to 1 tbl., used lite soy sauce and added a squeeze of 1/4 fresh orange in place of the other tbl of lemon juice.(sometime too much lemon juice starts to cook the chicken and orange seemed more mild) I let the thighs sit in soy and 1 tbl lemon juice about 1/2 hour. Melted butter, added garlic, then added the thighs with however much marinade was on them. I let it cook over med heat and they sort of simmered for about 25 min.(I turned a few times) The sauce cooked down and I added the little bit of marinade left. I added a little honey in because it was still a little too salty for me. They turned out very sticky and good.

Greasy.....No kidding! The chicken was flavorful, but I wouldn't use the drippings over rice unless you want to hear your arteries clogging....and this is from a person who likes to use drippings. That was too greasy even for me.

For this recipe, I use boneless, skinless thighs cut into chunks.  After marinating the chicken, I add the sauteed garlic to the mix, spread on a plate (including all of the marinade) and microwave for 8 minutes.  Easier, faster and doesn't burn.

We love any recipe with garlic so this one was greeted with enthusiasm at our table. Made good leftovers. The drippings are a little "greasy" as promised but tasty!

This is a GREAT recipe!  I used lemon juice and garlic powder instead.  Added chopped onion when I melted the butter.  Cooked the chicken in a wok in all of its marinade for 25 minutes over medium heat as suggested and also added a bit of honey to offset some of the saltiness, also as suggested by other reviewers.  Added half a bag of frozen peas and carrots during the last 7 minutes of cooking, probably should have put them in a bit sooner, but this dinner turned out AWESOME!   Served over rice.  Thanks for posting this, Gary

For some reason the soy sauce became a big ball of yuck burned in my pan.  I might try again (the chicken was good) put not over medium-high heat (at least not on my stove).

This was easy and excellent. TRY THIS RECIPE, you will be pleasantly surprised. This is going to be one of our "need quick" dinners. Maybe changing the name of the recipe will entice more people to look and make the recipe. Also, watch your flame and nothing will burn.

These were easy and my husband liked them, but I wasn't thrilled. The soy sauce and garlic gave a good taste, but I think it needs some tweaking. I did add a bit of honey to the sauce as the chicken was cooking, but some ginger would also be good. Be careful to keep the heat down on this or it will burn easily.

For what it is, this is a really good recipe.  It was very down home, comforting.  I used boneless, skinless thighs and added just a smidge of italian seasoning to spark it up, and both my husband and I were happy with the meal.  And NO, you should NOT add the marinade.

Yummmy... But I have to be honest, I totally felt my arteries collapsing onto each other!!  :o)  But I expected that much because it is Greasy Chicken!  So, this still gets 5 stars because the flavor was on point and the drippings made the rice delicious.  I made it with chicken thighs and followed the recipe exactly.  What I like about this recipe is that the "grease" drippings are not a must as the chicken tastes great without them.  So if it seems like too much "grease" for you, then cut down on the drippings for the rice and chicken.  :o)

I should have doubled my batch! My family loved this and yes it isn't a low fat dinner, but what do you expect with a recipe called "Greasy Chicken". We loved it!

This is super easy and super good!  I drizzled pan drippings all over my rice.  It made my rice so flavorful!  I love this recipe!!  I also made a batch of wings too.  My chicken never burned, nor was it too salty.  If you're gonna make this without the skin or butter, then you're not following the recipe and you should  make something else...like boiled chicken.

AWESOME. Excellent use for a cheaper meat. Here's how I did it:
-3 Skinless thighs (cut small parts off and ate as I was cooking! Yummy)
-Bragg's Liquid Aminos instead of soy sauce
-1/4 cup of lemon juice
Med heat for browning garlic, high heat for browning meat once on each side to sear (don't add marinade yet), turn back down to med. Add marinade plus 1/4 cup of white wine. Continue flipping meat occasionally to keep it moist until cooked through. Remove meat (can place in oven on 180-200 to keep warm; won't be there long); turn heat up some. Stir sauce w/ fork or whisk to keep from burning. Reduce until it's a deep golden color and simmers easily. Pour over chicken and whatever else!

This is a tasty, easy to do recipe. I made a couple additions. I like lemon so used about 4T lemon juice for the marinade with soy. After marinating 20min, I fried garlic in butter then immediately added the chicken only (no marinade, saved it for later) 3-4 min on each side, then sealed it in a casserole dish covered with aluminum foil then baked to keep it juicy and avoid burning. While the chicken baked, I used the same pan with leftover butter and garlic and pour the marinade in the pan. I added quark (cross between cream cheese and sour cream) and a bit of pepper. I poured it over the lemony chicken and served noodles on the side with more of this sauce. The sauce was in perfect harmony with the chicken and with the noodles tasted like a lemonish stroganoff. What a fantastic and easy meal!

We all loved the flavor but I had to be so so careful that the sauce didn't burn.  I'd make it again, though...probably with a few alterations of my own.

I made this recipe last night pretty much exactly as written.  The chicken came out tender and wonderfully flavorful.  My husband and son both loved it as much as I did.  I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This was a no brainer for my low carb diet!! I followed the recipe pretty much word for word.  The thighs had skin and bones.  I only use low sodium soy sauce.

At the last 10 minutes I threw in some fresh broccoli florets.  Easy, quick and yummy!

Thank you for the recipe!

Very flavorful. Not really as greasy as the name suggests. (However, I served the chicken without the drippings.) I used bottled lemon juice instead of fresh lemons. Delish!

Tasty recipe but I made a few changes to cut down on the "grease" and fat.  I used olive oil instead of butter and less Soy Sauce and I used the reduced sodium kind.  Overall a good recipe though.

This was a good recipe. My hubby, who claims to not like ckn thighs, loved this. It was as others stated pretty salty, and I used low sodium soy sauce. I took the advice of another review and added some honey and that seemed to do a great job of making taste less salty. I added maybe a little over a TBL spoon of honey.  I will make this again. There were no leftovers!

This is a great recipe, I usually cook it in the microwave for a fast delicious meal, and microwaving solves any burning pan problems.

This is one of the best chicken recipes EVER!! I have been cooking for 41 years. I have 4 children and 7 grandchildren, and reputation  as very good (great) cook! If you can get kids to eat it and beg for more, it has to be good.  It is requested every time one of them comes to our house. WTG Gary!!!
PS..A little fat but if you use in moderation it is ok. Again great job.

So good! I didn't marinate beforehand, and just added the soy sauce when the chicken was nearly done...med heat, and no lemon (didn't feel like running out to the store).  And only one little garlic clove. I also added some onion powder to it as well. Everyone loved it and proclaimed it one of the best chicken dishes we've ever had. Definitely a keeper.

Amazing thanks Gary I was bored and tried it. I used lemon juice and threw in a little onion and extra butter but Amazing! Just pay attention and scrape the pan often for drippings. I also used 1/8 soy cause I was nervous - everyone wants it again!

Made this in no time!!!  Was easy and the entire family loved it.  I variated slightly by adding onions and fresh broccoli to add a touch of color and vegetables!

I cooked this exactly as specified.  This was awesome.  My daughter and I both loved it.  I used skinless, boneless thighs.  I had to use the artificial lemon juice. It was fine. What an easy and delicious recipe.  Thanks.

You don't want to cook this on medium heat.  Soy sauce will burn up.  I won't try this again.

This was a quick and easy dinner.  I did not find it to be real greasy.  I removed the chicken skin prior to cooking.  I also did not have anything burn in the pan, the soy sauce and garlic cooked perfectly.  I suggest cooking over medium heat to avoid burning the sauce or garlic.

I thought this would have a strong flavor since the use of garlic and soy sauce.  This was not the case.  The chicken was bland.  I would not make again.

I made this recipe with boneless, skinless chicken breasts and it did not seem that greasy at all.  It was more of a rich, soy flavored-stir fry.  The chicken was flavorful.  I'd say it is a quick and simply way to cook chicken thighs on the stovetop.

I think this may be the first time I've ever eaten, let alone bought and cooked, chicken thighs. This was a pretty good introduction to a new cut of meat. Also, I presumed the recipe called for thighs with the bone-in and skin on, making it extra greasy.
Like a previous reviewer, I was unsure whether to cook the chicken in the marinade or not, so I did. It worked out fine, though - the chicken was very tasty. But oh, how greasy this was!
I might try this again with skinless thighs, though.

The chicken was good but i served it with rice and i have to say it wasnt very appetizing. The recipe didnt specify if you should add the marinade or not. So i added it. And it did clump up like another reviewer said. It burnt, and wasnt very good. I might make the chicken again just not using the drippings over rice.

Very tasty and surprisingly moist and flavorful.
I did a few things different.  I used Tamari instead of Soy sauce, lemon juice rather than fresh and some jarred minced garlic which I added to the marinade instead of putting it in the pan first.  I also added a little bit of garlic power to the marinade as well and also a healthy plash of toasted sesame oil to it for the Asian flare.
I used skinless thighs and I cooked for about 11 min without the excess marinade and then flipped and cooked another 5-6 minutes.  At that point I added the rest of the marinade and added some Sweet Potato "Noodles" (Placing the thighs on top of the bed) and cooked for another 7-8 minutes on a rolling boil.
Thighs were cooked perfectly and the "Noodles" were fully cooked and soaked up the flavors wonderfully.  The flavor was STRONG though so might be too much if you did something like this and didn't really enjoy an intense flavor.

This recipe is a super simple and easy to tweak. I used limes instead of lemons because I prefer them. I also used organic butter which may have altered the taste. Since I read the reviews, I decided to add a bit of honey to the marinade. That was a good decision. It was not best combination of flavors. If I followed the recipe verbatim, it may have been better but way saltier.  Happy to have found the recipe though because it was super easy and I had the ingredients already.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was great. I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs, subbed the lemon juice with rice wine vinegar, and didn't add the marinade to the cooking pan. Once the chicken was done I removed it kept it warm, then used the drippings to make veggie fried rice. Rich, but yummy!

Good flavor and think we cut down on the 'greasy' by using 1T butter and 1T olive oil to soften the garlic before browning the chicken with a few shakes of poultry seasoning, seasoned salt, and black pepper.  After the skin was browned, lowered the heat and cooked with a lid on the pan until cooked through (lots of liquid at this point). Then moved the chicken to a fresh non-stick pan and recrisped the skin (lots of fat came out), with a few spoonfuls of the pan juices.  Great flavor.

Thought this would be healthier than coating and frying in grease.  Removed skiin, used no salt butter & lower sodium soy sauce to keep with less calories, etc.  Neither my DH or I liked this at all.  Will not make it again.

Decided to throw some frozen chicken thighs in the slow-cooker with the rest of the ingredients. Cooked for about 5 hours on high until the chicken shredded. Thought it was a little bland...so I added basil, paprika, and instead of salt, I used alder-smoked salt. 

It turned out really good with the add-ins...I really suggest slow-cooker for cooking this recipe

We learned with this recipe that we are not chicken thigh eaters in this house, so that was a good lesson to learn and will save me the effort in future cooking.  I used bone-in with skin thighs, and as the title says, it makes for some greasy chicken.  We didn't enjoy the smell, the sauce over brown rice, or the chicken itself(but again, that was mostly due to the fact it was thigh meat of which we are not accustomed to eating) - it was thrown out after eveyone picked around on it. THe skin does not get browned and crisp at all, so without the skin this might be much improved (plus would cut out the "grease" entirely, but I won't be trying it again.)  Thanks anyway!

This was very good, but a bit too salty.  I would make it next time with low sodium soy sauce.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and it was still pretty greasy.

This was super easy and tasty.  My boyfriend and I liked it a lot, but then again we love thighs almost any kind of way.  I will be making it again because of the ease!  oh, and not too greasy, and I did not cook in the marinade.

Yummy, not greasy.  After cooking I did not end up with any drippings to put over rice. That is okay. Kids said 5 star but I think the cooking time should be 30 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was so easy to do yet the taste was really great. And despite the name, it wasn't greasy at all. Will definitely cook again.

Very Good! Had great flavor and was so easy! Great when your pressed for time. I didn't use the dripping over rice, I like my heart!

I wanted to make something faster than baked chicken, so I did this. As other reviewers mentioned, the recipe did not specific whether to use the marinade, so I did not. I found the burnt flavor a little off-putting, and there wasn't much else in the ways of flavor, so I would rank this as "alright".

This was ok.  My husband really liked it, and I thought that it was decent.  He wants me to make it again.  I didn't think it was overly greasy, and we did use the drippings over rice.  One thing I did differently was that I used a little white wine to scrape up the browned bits left behind.  Thought the sauce was good.

this is very good but i had to change a couple of things to make it better..for one garlic burns..and its not very tasty when it does...knowing that i did cook the garlic and butter with some onions but i put it aside when it was done...next i pan fried the chicken(leg quarters) 10 mins each side...then i baked it until it was done with the garlic and onions on top...it was very good..and yes it is still greasy..so if u r a drippings person u will be in heaven...thanks for sharing  m
