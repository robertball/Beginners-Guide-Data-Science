The soup was delicious and perfect for a cold winter's night. However, the recipe yielded less than 4 servings for me, so you should double it if you are serving 3 or more people.

Delicious. I had never cooked with fennel before and I really liked this. I used fire roasted tomatoes and dried herbs

I liked this a lot- it is very similar to another soup I make from canned tomatoes, and really enjoyed the addition of the fennel. I took other reviewers advice and doubled everything except for the fennel, as I had a very large bulb from my CSA. Instead of diced tomatoes I used a 28 oz. can of peeled crushed tomatoes. Sauteed the vegetables and then dumped everything in my slow cooker and cooked on low about 8 hours, then used my immersion blender to blend. Salt and pepper to taste, and it was delicious!

This was a nice way to use up fennel I had bought by mistake (thinking it was the base of leeks), but I think it may need something more as a spice. I doubled the recipe to be rid of the fennel, and had no olive oil on hand (so used vegetable oil and would use less of it next time). I also could not puree to smooth the soup, given that my blender leaked a little, and so I was hurrying it along and had some small chunks of veggies in it, but that turned out fine anyway. We served it with a bread loaf alongside grilled ham and cheese sandwiches for dinner tonight. My 13-year-old said it didn't look very red, but she liked the taste of it. I agreed about the color, but was not willing to add food coloring just for the sake of that. We will make this again, so thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very tasty soup. Great flavor with the fennel and fresh herbs. I'll definitely be making this one again! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

My dad is 94, and read an article about fennel. He was curious so I bought some and have been trying various recipes. This one is a keeper. It is hearty and delicious and versatile as well. Add more broth if you like, and a little pasta, grate a bit of Parmesan on top to serve, brighten it up some with a squeeze of lemon. I think a little spinach would be good as well.  Serve with hot crusty bread. My dad loved it. Fennel is nutritious and contains anti-oxidants, and phyto-nutrients that help prevent cancer on a genetic level.

I was looking for a recipe to use veggies from my CSA; this didn't fit the bill exactly, but I used it as a base, and WOW! I will post the recipe I remade from it separately, but thank you for this basic recipe; to those who try it "as is" I suggest topping it off with grated Parmesan cheese and serving with garlic toast. We finished it off completely. Basic changes I made included using stewed tomatoes instead of diced (it's what I had) and adding some chopped plum tomatoes as well.

I took heed to other reviews citing lack of flavor And added scallion, onion powder, mushroom powder and a little more garlic. Voilà! It popped with flavor while still subtle and light. I blended it salsa style and left it slightly chunky. Delicious with a warm baguette

followed recipe exactly.  I love fennel,  but finished soup had no hint of fennel flavor.  Just tasted like plain tomato soup.

Though very decent tasting, it wasn't as flavorful as I'd hoped. The fennel flavor wasn't overpowering at all, which I thought it would be. It's good and I will make it again, though will add more spices next time.

It's an ok recipe...it's healthy and that counts. I left it fairly chunky and really liked the texture. I agree with the girl who said it doesn't make 4 servings...it was the perfect amount to serve for 2 along with cheese panninis.  I added salt at the table. Brother taster kept saying how much he loved this soup and says I have to make it again. I will but I need to find something to make it better, I'll lit you know what...stay tuned!

I love this soup! So fresh and tasty, and easy to make.  We love it so much we need to double it though, so I thought I would just add to the existing reviews that the vegetables need to be sautéed longer if you double the recipe to carmelize the delicious fennel/onion/celery mixture. Thanks so much for the recipe! It's a winner in our household!

Making the soup with vegetable broth was my only deviation from the original recipe. The recipe was okay. I enjoyed the subtle fennel flavor. I will make this recipe again I'm sure however there wasn't enough "richness" of flavor for me to rate it higher than 3 stars. Perhaps in the future I'll add a few more spices to it.

It was very good though mine did not come out as thick as the picture. I maybe should have cooked it down a little more. It was tasty though and very aromatic. I will make it again.

Pretty easy to make. I added some Nantes carrots and it goes really nicely with the tomatoes. The fresh basil gives the soup nice spots of color too.  A new definite go-to in my book!

Recipe was easy to follow, quick and the soup turned out well. I was worried about how much fennel was going in, but cooking it in the olive oil first really mellowed the flavor out. My only issue is that this tasted a bit too much like marinara to us. It was difficult to eat as a full cup of soup.

Can't stand licorice, this gets rid of that flavour but gives tomato soup a mystery kick!
