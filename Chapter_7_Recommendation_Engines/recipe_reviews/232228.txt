I made a few alterations because I didn’t have most of the ingredients ??     1. 2 clementines 2. A huge apple 3. Around 2 cups of baby carrots. The carrots are the main source of flavor but overall it’s really good!

I really love how I could taste each ingredient yet they all blended together perfectly. I did not add the red bell because I did not have one. The juice is a little sweet and leans more towards a veggie flavor. Not sure if I would make it a favorite without the ginger.
