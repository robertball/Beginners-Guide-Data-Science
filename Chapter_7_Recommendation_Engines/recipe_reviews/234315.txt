I am rating this just on the decoration.  It was such a huge success nobody wanted to cut into it.  My "hair" was radish strips and I used my own tried and true cheese ball recipe.  This was sooooo cute.

Took this to a Halloween party.  My son's were pretty mad I didn't bring home the leftovers.  Now they want me to make them another one.
