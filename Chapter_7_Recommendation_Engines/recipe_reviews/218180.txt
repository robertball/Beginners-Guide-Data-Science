Mmmmm!!!! This beautiful megenta color soup is so tasty and delicious!!!! I modified it a bit - I skipped the roasting part (and skipped peeling the red skinned potatoes) and just sauted all the chopped vegetables in a large soup pot. I omitted the thyme - (i dont like it) and instead, after i pureed the soup i added freshly chopped dill. I used soy milk instead of milk. i was a but skeptical about the milk and lemon juice, so i tried the soup before i added those ingredients, then added them and it really balanced the sweetness of the beets. I am glad i added them.

The soup was really tasty and beautiful color, but I think I would add more beets and potatoes to that amount of stock just to thicken it up.

A bit bland flavor-wise, so I had to add more pepper, salt, and also about a teaspoon of Tabasco smoked chipotle pepper sauce.  To be honest, I am not a big fan of beets in general, but after adding to this recipe as noted, the soup made it possible for me to eat beets.  In the future, I might also add some ham or Italian sausage to it.

Really delicious!  This didn't taste heavily of beets to me, but nice, balanced, creamy and lightly sweet.  I added 4 cloves of garlic instead of one, and used 1/2 cup of half-and-half instead of 1 1/2 of whole milk to keep the soup thicker but still creamy.  Delicious and cheap.  I will make this again!

this recipe is fantastic and beautiful to boot. the vegetable mixture actually ended up cooking down quite a bit for me, so the texture and thickness ended up perfect; no modifications necessary.

Have to say, I hate it when someone rates the recipe after altering it but here I go (was trying to use up leftover misc things in my fridge from Christmas). First off, I used an acorn squash in add'n to the potato and beets (roasted as directed). I used leeks instead of the onion. For the chick broth, I used 1 cup chick broth (all that I had left), 2 cups vegetable broth and 1 cup white wine (btw-"Better than Bouillon" is awesome). For the milk, I used 1 cup hvy cream and 1/2 cup 1% milk (what I had on hand). This was EXCELLENT but rich. Will make again :)

Very tasty! I altered the recipe slightly- no thyme and instead used chives and parmesan cheese as garnish- and didn't really follow the quantities so it was thicker than expected but still so delicious! The addition of milk and lemon juice definitely made a huge difference.

Doubled the veggies, and added garlic and carrots to the roasting pan.  Put a pint of heavy cream in the end to finish too.  Yummy!!!

Amazingly simple and delicious! I made a double batch then added an extra cup each of beets and potatoes as I wanted to use up what I had.  Served eight happy campers for dinner. What a great way to incorporate beets into a meal! This is a fabulous starter soup that can be tweaked in so many ways. Glad I found it!

i was immensely blown away at the most gourmet, savory flavor of this soup. I don't like beets much in general. I thought this recipe toned the strong flavor of it down . The spices and the roasting is the key to the flavor. id make this again and again! not to mention the color! how beautiful. thing is we ate it hot - so i left out the lemon and i also used soy milk.

I made this soup tonight for Halloween dinner, it was absolutely scrumptious. I did not puree it fully, I left it a little chunky, the flavour with the roasted beets and potatoes definately adds to the flavour.

This soup was excellent!  Once pureed, it was very creamy and flavorful.  I love that it did not require many ingredients and was very easy to make.  The only changes I made were that I forgot to add the lemon juice and I didn't have any celery, but I was equally happy with the result.

This was a hit at a “Russian night” dinner party- many compliments.  I made some slight changes. It had a tiny bit of potato texture and a nice raspberry color.  I think I put a bit too much garlic and black pepper but everyone loved it.

Delicious.  I really enjoyed this soup.  I would add more beets next time.  Additionally I used fresh thyme not dried and it was perfect.  I also added some cooked chicken pieces to the soup when I served it to make it a more complete meal.

I have made this soup with both red and gold beets.  It was good with red but it was fantastic with gold beets if you can get your hands on some.

Very tasty! Even our non-beet-lovers enjoyed this soup. It's got a hearty but not overly-strong flavor.
I used a can of coconut milk instead of the cream, because that's what I had. 
I will definitely make this again!

I was looking for a recipe that used jarred beets since I had a jar that has been in the cabinet for quite a while and I did not want them to go to waste.  As it turned out, I also had 2 large leftover  baked potatoes in the fridge which I used with the jarred beets.  I thought to myself, what do I have to loose, take the potato from the skins, use the whole jar of beets, juice and all and I am very glad I did.   The result was a delicious soup. My husband and I both loved it.  

My intention is to have the soup again for dinner and accompany it with the leftover baked potato skins which I will fill with bacon and cheese and greek yogurt.  .

By the way, I also used onion powder (a good heaping tablespoon) since I did not have any onions in the house.  Used the last one yesterday and did not want to go to the store on what I figured would be a busy Sunday. Still the soup was yummy!

Oh I love the color of the soup, the taste is on point as well. I modified the amount of milk, I used a half a cup of whole milk. I left out the onions since I did not have them. A very nice recipe to play with!

Great soup recipe! I used 4 Garlic cloves and 2 % milk (all I had in the fridge) but followed teverything else in he recipe. We were very pleased with the flavor. A great basic "Old Country" (Eastern European) type soup that would complement any dinner or be a stand alone dish. I liked the idea someone had suggested of serving it with Polish Kielbasa.

Love this soup.  We are always looking for something different and this was quite nice.  Delicious and gorgeous color.
My daughter can not have dairy so I substituted with coconut milk.  I also used four cloves of garlic and a little extra pepper.  Everyone loved it.

I thought it was really good. I loved the smoky taste and the smell, and the lemon juice balances nicely the sweetness, I added more of it, though. Unfortunately, my 3 year old and 11 month old were not thrilled about this soup, but I wasn't going to base my rating on their pickiness. I enjoyed it very much!

Tastier than anticipated, that's for sure! Will definately put on my "regulars" list of meals. The only altering done was that I had very small potatoes and only small four beets which made my recipe small so I eye-balled the broth and (1%) milk.

Good soup. We needed to add a little something to tweak it. I added cayenne pepper. Garlic croutons worked, too. Will definitely make again.

It is one of my absolute favorite soups. I like to leave mine a little chunky so I just don't blend it as long. I serve it with homemade crostinis and it is delicious.

My wife loves beets, so I tried this for her.  She really liked it, and even though I'm not necessarily a beet enthusiast myself, I thought it was pretty good.  
I think I roasted the beets and potatoes too long, because they came out kinda dried up and small, but there was definitely a delicious roasted flavor in there at the end, so it didn't hurt it.
Did it with whole milk this time, but will try 1 or 2% next time, and see if it makes a difference.
Also, we don't have an immersible/wand/stick blender, so I just let it cool down, poured it all into our Ninja mixer, added the milk and lemon juice, and that worked just fine - lovely puree.  Just had to heat it back up, via the microwave.

What a wonderful soup!  I followed the recipe to the letter with no changes and now I just can't stop eating/drinking it. Will make often through the winter.  Love the color too. I will probably double or triple the recipe so there's more to savor for longer.   Judi D.

I really wanted to like it, but I don't.  I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks, anyway.

Awesome soup, beautiful to look at, nice to eat, even cold. I brought with for lunch on the go, but had no place to warm it up, and it wasn't in a thermos. but still good, with a dollop of Greek yogurt and a mini bagel for a side. Made it just as directed.

I followed the recipe and was pleased with the taste and presentation. One mistake I made is that I roasted for the stated time in my convection oven and they were a little over done. My fault. I usually reduce the time accordingly but omitted to do that this time. This is a delightful soup I will make many times in the future. Hubby loved it.

Want to add more beets to my diet. This recipe was a hit, especially for a cold winter evening. I used sweet potatoes (what I had and offers more nutrients), didn’t purée for a chunkier soup, and I added a dollop of sour cream. A keeper recipe!

Great recipe and great tasting soup.  Puts a real nice spin on a potato soup.  Going to use a potato and sweet potato mixture with the beets next time.

soup was good but really not what I was looking for, it tasted more like chicken stock and lemon than earthy beets.

I used 2% milk (because that was what I had on hand). Otherwise, I followed the directions as is and this soup came out amazing!!!! Just lovely (as a rater before said "beautiful magenta color"). I would serve it to guests!

I made mine with adding organic gold beets, potatoes, garlic and half an onion...added some balsamic vinegar and more spices because, I like to spice it up! It was OK. I think I just don't like the beets, they're too sweet. If I added maybe some light meat like chicken, I probably would have enjoyed it better. I'm just picky when it comes to my soups!

This dish had a very mild flavor; one could almost say bland. I liked it well enough and we'll probably finish the leftovers. However, it was a lot of work - an hour to peel and dice the vegetables, an hour to roast them, an hour for all the remaining steps. When I put three hours of work into a dish, I want an amazing result, and this fell quite a bit short of that bar.

After roasting the beets and potatoes, I almost abandoned making  the soup.  The roasted vegetables are delicious and will make a great side.  I did make the soup, following the recipe with two changes. I added carrots and white pepper.   I served it with a dallup of sour cream and good bread.  Healthy, inexpensive and delicious.

I had new potatoes, beets and leeks that needed to be used from a farmer's market.  I roasted the potatoes diced, with skin on and roasted the beets, diced but unpeeled.  I don't think this changed the recipe other than making it easier than it already is.  I added leeks to the celery onion sauté and added a lot more garlic, plus more salt and pepper.   I used 2% milk to cut down on fat.  I thought the flavors blended well together. This soup makes a very good healthy addition to a meal.

We found this soup quite tasty, beautiful in the bowl, and a lovely texture.  I used soy milk powder and regular milk. I omitted the celery because I didn't have any and added dill seed, which added complexity to the flavour.  We dabbed sour cream on top and had sour dough bread with it.  All in all a lovely meal.  My only complaints would be that it took a long time to prepare and now I've got a lot of dishes to wash.

My mother grew beets in her garden, so I grew up eating a lot of beets: beets for supper all summer long; pickled beets (sour); and borscht (sweet and sour beet soup). I found that this soup recipe did in fact taste good: it reminded me of the type of soups sometimes served in high-end gourmet restaurants. I made mine without milk, and it still tasted good. I will not make this recipe again though because I associate beets with a sour taste rather than a "chicken broth" taste. I really much prefer the sour taste. I can easily imagine that children would like this soup.

Made exactly as directed with one exception, I stopped at one cup of whole milk because I really liked the texture at that point. Delicious recipe and beautiful color! Will definitely be making this again. Also I'd recommend this as serving no more than four. Husband and I split a full recipe as a side dish and it was quite filling.

My husband is not normally a fan of beets and we definitely enjoyed this. I did not follow the recipe exactly. I used 3 large beets and one medium sized potato. Substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth since that is what I had available. Very tasty!

Out of this world. I made it as called for but used one minor substitution - a shallot instead of onion because it's what I had on hand. Forget any idea of altering or adjusting or adding weird things like hot sauce. Hot sauce? The recipe is perfect as is.

Super yummy. I veganized it really simply by switching the chicken stock to veggie, and the milk to cashew cream. I mashed it with a potato masher bc cleaning my immersion blender is a pain. Love it! My husband asked me to make it again!

Really good soup!
I replaced the potatoes by sweet potatoes and poured it half and half in a bowl. I served it with a crispy bread and some brie. Delicious!
