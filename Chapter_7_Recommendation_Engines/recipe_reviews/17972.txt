Ya know, this recipe is pretty good but high on the fat content from the sour cream and mayo.  For those who wish a virtually fat free version, and we think, tastier try the smoked fish dip recipe from Chuck and Kris, Sarasota, FL.  This dip is world class.

My husband ice fishes during the winter and we enjoy smoked bass quite frequently.  This recipe is not only simple and elegant way to serve fish, it is also delicious.  When entertaining, I take a whole smoked bass and stuff it with the "super smoked fish dip" on a bed of lettuce greens and lemon wheels.  An absolute hit - and it makes an excellent presentation.  Enjoy!

This is a FABULOUS recipe! I was thrilled to find it here as I have had smoked marlin dip before and loved it. My recommendation for ultimate enjoyment it to serve it with Ritz crackers and pickled jalapenos. The combination seems to bring out the best in the recipe.

I thought this was a delicious recipe! We had smoked some redfish. I thought the smoke flavor was too strong, so I decided to make this dip. It was so simple with only 3 other ingredients! It turned out better than I thought it would taste. 5 Stars!!

I used this basic recipe, then added onions, and stuffed green olives that I pureed in a food processor. I couldn't believe the reviews I got.

This is an okay recipe but, take marlin off the menu as their reproductive cycle is much longer than any other fish in the sea. Use a different fish like talapia/mahi.
