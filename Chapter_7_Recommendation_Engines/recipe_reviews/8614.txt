After learning from my first attempt, I believe I've got the tricks for this recipe. I took tips from myself and other reviews as follows: 1.) season chicken, but watch the salt since the sauce has soy sauce 2.) add 2 tbsp cornstarch and boil sauce on stovetop until thick 3.) cover chicken and cook 45 mins @ 375 4.) uncover and cook for 15 more mins. This came out REALLY good for me. The chicken was tender but not dry and the wings were truly "sticky." The sauce was stuck to them and it was O SO GOOD. You won't be disappointed.

I followed some previous suggestions when using this recipe with boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I cooked the sauce on the stove for about 15 minutes then put it on top of the chicken. 20 minutes at 400 and it turned out delicious.

Thank you Sandy!  This is the best baked chicken ever.  I cut everything in half, as I was only cooking one chicken breast (with bone in and skin on) for myself.  I did add a dash of cayenne pepper to tone down the sweetness a bit - to fit my own taste.  This was a trial run - I will serve it for company next week.  Be sure and put a cookie sheet below your baking dish - when this begins to carmelize - it may overflow.  It makes a beautiful piece of chicken - like the photos in cookbooks.  Again, thank you Sandy for sharing.  It is absolutely wonderful. I wish I could give it 6 stars.  P.S.  I forgot to add:  I prepared teh sause in a pot on the stove, brought it to a boil and then turned the fire out - a must for it to carmelize correctly.  Also I turned the chicken breast over after 30 minutes.  If it is too sweet for you, cut back on the honey and add a extra catchup, maybe  little mustard.  Enjoy!

I am logged in under my wife's username.  She gave me permission to post.

This recipe has become a running joke in our household.  My wife is an excellent cook.  In the 7 years we have been married this is the only recipe that I couldn't find anything good to say about.  I believe my candid response was this taste like butt.

Normally I wouldn't be so harsh but it was an involuntary response... it just sort of came out.  She has made many recipes since then and 95% of them are very tasty.  4.99% of them are interesting (she likes to experiment)... and then there is the .01% that is the wings.

Maybe something went terribly awry and this really is a good recipe...  I don't know.  I just couldn't resist writing about our expereience when I saw this recipe in her recipe box.

Sorry to the original poster. My intention is not to be overly critical.  It's just a family legend now. :-)

This was very good. I used a skinless boneless chicken breast and followed the instructions of other reviewers and used  3/4 cup ketchup, 3/4 cup honey, 1/2 cup soy sauce, and 3-4 cloves garlic, cooking the mixture on the stove top until boiling and reducing heat and cooking for 5-10 min. I baked at 350 for about 40 minutes.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I love how simple the ingredients are and the wonderful flavor.  I got this recipe several months ago and I can't count the number of times I have made it.  I have only made it so far with chicken breasts as a main dish.  It will be wonderful with pork chops.  The sauce is wonderful with rice. If you don't like or don't have honey, you can substitute corn syrup (for all or a portion of the honey), it is virtually the same, just without that hint of honey.  I can't imagine not having this recipe anymore.  I will ALWAYS keep this recipe in my baking arsenol.

I made this recipe exactly as stated except I used 3 pounds of skinned boneless chicken breasts (cut into 2 x 2 x 1 inch pieces). I poured the liquid mixture over the chicken and put in the oven for 1 hour (without covering).  The sauce did not caramelize.  I put the pan on the lower oven rack as suggested by others and basted one time during baking.  After one hour my chicken was starting to dry out and burn. I took the chicken out of the oven and removed it from the pan.  The juices were starting to burn along the inside of the pan so I put the sauce in a fresh pan and baked for another 20 minutes.  The liquid did not caramelize.  Taking into consideration how many people have been unable to get the liquid to caramelize, I'm wondering whether an ingredient or an additional step was left out of the receipe. The taste was good but the consistency was like water.  Do wings have considerably less water than other chicken pieces, so that wings are sticky but other pieces are not?  What is the trick?

Excellent. On a scale of 1 to 10, this is an 11!! Used 8 whole boneless, skinless chicken breasts and turned out great.  My daughter (5yrs old) kept saying how "Good they are Mom!" The best part, (and to my daughter's surprise)...my man made them! So if he can do it right, anyone can.  Devoured in no time. Thank you for posting this recipe!

These were so good.  I am glad I doubled the sauce.  I followed another persons review and put everything in a pot on the stove adding 2T of cornstarch and brought it to a boil.  I lightly seasoned my wings and then poured the thickened mixture on, covered and baked 45 minutes. Then I baked 15 more minutes uncovered basting every 5 with sauce.  Wow.  Thanks for a delicious recipe.

This is quite good. I add some crushed red peppers to the sauce and an extra clove of garlic. Plus, I always just use boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I bake them at 400 for about 10 minutes on each side. Then I slice them into thin slices and throw back in the pan with sauce, toss to coat and stick under the broiler for a couple of minutes. I have noticed that if I use Kikoman Light Soy Sauce, the sauce doesn't want to caramalize as well, so I just stick to the La Choy Light. My picky young kids and husband just love this chicken.

I have used a slight variation of this sauce for years as my barbeque sauce, and it never fails to impress.  I mix 1 1/2 cups ketchup, 1 cup honey, and 1 cup soy sauce, with lots of chopped garlic and a dash of hot sauce to taste.  NO OIL!  You can baste your chicken or ribs as they grill.  The sauce keeps forever in the fridge, and is a huge hit!

OK, so I always read the recipe, then a few reviews and make changes if I feel like it, I know this irks some reviewers, but here's what I did differently... We have VERY strong flavored local honey, and 1 cup would've been overpowering (and expensive!)... So I did a half cup honey and half cup brown sugar, added a good glug of molasses, and I used butter instead of oil.  My thought process for this substitutions was to create more of a "caramel" on the stovetop by simmering (almost boiling!) for about 10 mins.  When I still wanted it thicker, I added a slurry of 1ts cornstarch + 1Tb h2o and continued simmering a few mins more...  This worked beautifully.  Flavor-wise, the only thing I added was the juice of 1/4 lemon and a squeeze of ginger paste which I feel really brightened the flavors.  I have been on a teriyaki/kalbi kick lately and this fit right in!  Will def make again, but only with my changes or it would've been way too thin and liquidy rather than as caramelly as it turned out.  I used boneless thighs this time, and would definitely recommend this but I will surely try it on wings as called for very soon.  Oh, and I like things super saucy so I made the full amt for 1.5# chicken and it was way too much sauce... I refrigerated half... so FYI proportions given are plenty generous.

I tried this recipe because I happened to have all the ingredients on hand.  I mad mine with boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I cut so they wouldn't be as thick.  I mixed the sauce and put it on the stove for about 20 min. and added a little corn starch and water to thicken it up.  Then I poured it over the chicken and baked it on a foil lined cookie sheet for about 20 min.  It came out perfectly.  Very sticky and good.  My husband ate ALL of it.  Thanks Sandy!

I reduced the olive oil to 1 tablespoon and doubled the remaining sauce ingredients, then simmered the mixture on the stove top for about 15 minutes until it thickened. The sauce was  poured over large chunks of boneless skinless chicken and baked for an hour. I served the chicken on a bed of noodles.  It was delicious.  And I already had all of the ingredients on hand.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe!I just use skinless chicken breasts or bone in thighs which are really the best, the bone gives lots of flavor. I did tweak it a bit. I was out of soy sauce and I had A-1 teryaki steak marinade and it made it INCREDIBLE! To that I also added a little bit of orange zest and a little sqeeze of the orange half that I zested and it was so good! I've since made it with soy sauce and it is still really good, but if you happen to try the teriayki marinade instead and add the orange zest and juice you will not be dissapointed! I have made this about 10 times in the past 4 months and shared the recipe with several friends and they all love it.

I found the trick to getting the sauce to caramelize.  Lay a piece of foil just on the top of your baking dish during baking. Turn the chicken about every 20 to 30 minutes to coat with sauce.  This dish requires 1 hour & 45 minutes to 2 hours baking time to complete the caramelization process.

Just made it. It is the best Carmelized chicken I have ever had. I did what some reviews suggested and cooked glaze on stove top for 10 minutes adding cornstartch and about three shakes of red pepper flakes. Used  5 large chicken breasts instead. cooked for 45 minut at 350 and reglazed it every 10 minutes. Glaze amount is well than enough. Will make this a regular dish in my house :0)

I made a 9x13 dish of boneless skinless breasts.  I followed the modifications for the sauce (I too wanted a thicker sauce) by the reviewer named Meredith, except I used only 1/4 c. soy sauce and added 1T sugar to cut the wang from using honey (maybe b/c I used raw honey?).  Let the sauce reduce on stovetop while the breasts cook in oven for 15 minutes covered with foil.  Remove chicken from oven, mop up any water from the dish, then pour sauce all over chicken and bake uncovered for 20 minutes.  Very delicious.  If you want an even thicker sauce, reserve half of your sauce rather than pouring over chicken, and continue reducing sauce over stovetop while chicken is baking.

I couldn't get mine to caramelize either.  I'm sure it would have been 100x better had they caramelized as they were supposed to.  I did read a bunch of reviews and other people were trying to use the recipe with chicken breasts.  There is one review that gives other directions on how to make the sauce specifically for chicken breasts... I followed this way and although the sauce became thick it did NOT caramelize.  Next time I'm going to try the original recipe... it sure smelled devine

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut up into small pieces to serve over rice.  I found that the sauce caramelized better if I cooked it down seperately and then added it to the chicken.  Since it really doesn't carmelize until the "last minute" on the chicken, there is a danger of over-cooking (which I did and it was my fault...not the recipe's) so be careful out there!  Next time I will add some ginger and hot red pepper to make it more like General Tsao chicken...can't wait!  Thanks Sandy for sharing.

These turned out good. I did not change the sauce but I did change the method I used to prepare them. First I dredged wings in just a bit of flour and refrigerated for 1 hour. I baked the wings for about 20 mins, and then brushed sauce on the chicken baked 20 min. turned and repeated. They really caramelized with this method. Make sure to use foil and spray with cooking spray.

I have been looking for a good General Tso's type chicken, and this sauce was great.  I breaded chunks of chicken breast in cornstarch and seasoning salt and cooked in a large skillet.  Then i cooked and thickened the sauce, adding a dash of ginger and about a 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes.  I halved the recipe, but added an additional T of ketchup.  Drain chicken on paper towels, place back in skilled, and pour sauce over chicken and simmer to desired consistency.  This came out slightly spicy and delicious; served with white rice and broccoli.  My husbands favorite chinese sauce recipe so far!

Absolutely Fabulous!  Did not have the 1 cup of honey (I used approximately over 1/2 cup) but found that the recipe was still sweet and was able to caramelized.  I would recommend the Sauce Soja Soy Sauce (great flavor, little salt) found in Asian markets...my family found that this particular brand isn't overpowering and is great for marinades.

I made these for my husband's 50th birthday party in October.  I ran out of these wings so quickly that I knew that they were terrific.  I have made them for other parties and gatherings and they still are the first to disappear.  EVERYONE loves them!!

Used skinless, boneless chicken breasts, and for two people, used 1-1/2 pounds. Thinking a full recipe of the sauce would be better than cutting those ingredients in half, I put them in a saucepan with 2 T of corn starch and simmered for 15 minutes, then dumped the chicken pieces (2" cubes) into the sauce, then into the baking pan. Baked 45 minutes covered at 375 then 10 minutes uncovered. Next time, will cut the ingredients for the sauce in half as well. Maybe add some pineapple? Served with baked rice, green salad and "No Salad Dressing Salad Dressing" from the Allrecipe site. Very satisfactory meal.

This was delicious! I cut down the recipe and only used 2 chicken breasts. I simmered the glaze on the stove top for 15 minutes and then poured it over the chicken in a 8x8 glass baking dish. I cooked it at 400 for 25 mins. turning the chicken over every 5 to 10 minutes or so. It was really tasty and it was the perfect consistency. YUM!

This is delicious, BUT cooking the sauce on top of the stove first is a MUST in order to get the sauce to caramelize in the oven.  You can also substitute your favorite store-bought BBQ sauce for the ketchup for a nice, smoky flavor.   I used 3/4 cup BBQ sauce, 3/4 cup honey, 1/2 cup soy and chopped garlic cooked on the stove for about 15 min.  I have used this over skinless boneless breasts as well as chicken thighs.  Pour the sauce over the chicken and cook 375 for about 45 min. Terrific!!

LOVED IT!  I used Meredith's review advice and made the sauce the way she instructed so it's thicker and plentiful. But I also added 2 tbl. corn starch.  The sauce thickened beautifully!  I used chicken thighs and legs (10 pieces). I sprinkled worcestershire sauce on the chicken and baked it for 45 minutes, while I was making the sauce on the stove top.  Then I drained the juices from the chicken and poured the sauce over all the pieces. I covered it back up and put it in for 15 more minutes. Took the cover off and baked for 20 more minutes.  It was perfect! I served with steamed white rice. There was a lot of extra sauce that everyone drizzled over the rice.  It was delicious! My kids had seconds!

Wonderful! I used a cut up chicken so I could feed the whole family. I fried it a bit first and also added a bit of minced ginger to the sauce. We all thought it was finger lickin good.

My chicken wings never caramelized.  the sauce was anything but sticky and gooey.  I turned up the heat to 450 degrees after the first 30 minutes.  Wings still didn't caramelize so I removed from the pan after another 30 minutes, put into another without the sauce and broiled for 5 minutes.  Got raves from my friends at our football party.

These were amazing! I did do a few things differently but stuck true to the recipe otherwise. Like other reviewers I boiled the sauce first to thicken it up, thus ensuring a truly "sticky" chicken wing. (You also want to pat the chicken dry with a paper towel before you add the sauce to it, otherwise it will just slide right off.) Into the sauce I added a dash of sesame oil and a few sprinkles of five-spice powder and onion powder. As this sauce has lots of honey in it you are going to want to cover the pan with foil for the first 45 minutes of baking, or they will surely burn. Since my additions made it a decidedly Asian flavor I topped with toasted sesame seeds and some scallions when they came out of the oven. Sooo fantastic!!! My boyfriend said "Wow" when he saw them. Even without my additions I can tell they will be great and I will make them the original way next time :) Thanks so much Sandy, for this great recipe!!!

We loved this sauce, Sandy! It tasted just like the sauce used at our favorite Asian restaurant. They do a teriyaki chicken that's to die for, and this is it exactly! I cut chicken breasts into strips and baked with the sauce, then sprinkled with sesame seeds.I served with house fried rice and stir fry veggies. Thanks so much for sharing this delicious recipe with us.

While the glaze was good, cooking it in "fatty" type of chicken parts made it way too greasy.  I tried this again with boneless skinless breasts instead of chicken parts with skin.  It still came out with a runny sauce.  I had reserved some of the glaze, thickened it on the stove top, and serve it as a dipping sauce which was good.

As others have stated, this sauce is too runny: adding cornstarch & boiling on the stove until thickened before pouring over the chicken solves the problem.  I made this a third time using large, bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts.  I rubbed with salt, pepper and garlic powder on and under the skin and let them sit while I cooked the sauce. I added another minced garlic clove, upped the ketchup to 1/2 c., lowered the honey to 1/2 c., skipped the olive oil and added a dash of Frank's red hot sauce.  I did not use cornstarch this time, but brought the mixture to boiling, reduced to simmer, then cooked, stirring frequently till the sauce thickened - approx. 10 minutes.  I brushed the underside of the breasts & under the skin with the sauce, placed them in a 13x9 glass baking dish, then poured the remaining sauce over them. I baked them in at 375 for 45 minutes, starting to check for doneness at about 35 minutes. The meat was tender and delicious. I served it with baked vegetable kabobs bought in the grocery produce dept. I seasoned them with olive oil cooking spray, sea salt, freshly ground pepper and oregano, then baked them in a separate pan, along with the chicken for the last 15 minutes.  I turned the kabobs after about 10 minutes. I left them in the oven for another 7 minutes after removing the chicken and letting it rest.

Awesome!! Used boneless breasts and pork chops. Cooked sauce on stovetop and used 1/2 cup honey + some brown sugar. 1/4 cup soy and 1/4 cup teriyaki, then added 2 tlb cornstarch into about 1/4 cup water to thicken.  Poured over meat and cooked like directed SO good, put over fried rice recipe from this site.

To make it a little bit more oriental tasting, add some fresh ginger to the marinade.

To caramelize the chicken, two important rules  you must follow:
1- Do not crowd your pan.  This will "sweat" the chicken, which means the chicken juice will come out and make the dish runny.

2- Cook the chicken at room temperature.  This will help the meat to be cooked more uniform.

A pretty good and easy wing recipe.  Boil the sauce down in a sauce pan to less then 1/2 first and then put it in the oven with the wings and the result will be closer to what was probably intended.

I made this recipe with 1 lb. of skinless boneless breasts and cooked it for 25 minutes.  The chicken came out very tender and had great flavor.  There was alot of extra sauce in the pan which could be used as gravy or put it over white rice.

Threw some boneless, skinlesss chicken thighs in the bottom of the crock pot. Poured the sauce over and cooked for three hours on low. ( I added some onion flakes and a pinch of pepper flakes for some heat)  Pulled the chicken out. Added a slurry of 4 teaspoons cornstarch and 6 tablespoons of water and bumped the heat to high until the sauce got thick. Served over rice. So good. So easy. Everyone liked it. I have also tried it per Meredith on the reviews and it wasn't as good.

This sauce is delicious! Like most of the reviewers, I cooked it stove top first. I had the chicken in the oven while the sauce cooked. I then poured half of the sauce on the chicken (I used leg quarters), cooked for about 20 min, and then poured the rest of the sauce on the chicken and cooked the rest of the way. I did not add any cornstarch or flour and it caramelized very well like this. Can't wait for the leftovers!

This was very nice but a little disappointing.  The sauce was mild and certainly didn’t overpower the chicken flavor, but I wish it had more oomf.  After reading the reviews about the sauce not thickening, I started the sauce on the stovetop before pouring it over the chicken.  I also basted the chicken wings with the sauce every ten minutes to get the coating I was hoping for.

Usually I make  recipes exactly as stated before reviewing, but this is the exception.  Tasted the sauce before pouring over the chicken, and it was SOOOO salty from the soy sauce, that I needed to do something, because salt will not come out.
I added some vinegar, I had balsamic on hand, and then some lemon juice,also we like spicy foods, so added cayenne pepper also.  It was much better taste then.  Baked for 20 min then turned up the heat to 450 and returned to oven to crisp up the skin, about 15 min till done.
Was really a wonderful tasting dish, and VERY moist. 
Will make this many more times.

Excellent recipe!  I tweaked it after reading other reviews.  Instead of using 1 cup of honey, I used 1/2 cup of honey and 1/2 cup maple syrup and used the LIGHT soy sauce.  I added all ingredients and cooked in microwave for 3 minutes and I added corn starch (1 tablespoon with just a bit of water) and add to the mix and cooked in microwave for another 2 minutes and then I added this to the chicken.  I first cooked the chicken 30 minutes and then I added the sauce and cooked another 30 minutes, while bastsing it in between and sauce did carmelize.  Perfect!

These are excellent! Used wings - separated into two pieces at joint.  Followed advice from another reviewer by making sauce with cornstarch first.  Rave reviews from friends.  Will be making them again for the Saints/Colts Superbowl party.  WHO DAT!

I used bone-in, skin-on thighs. I lifted the skin up and brushed a small amount of the glaze onto the raw meat, then sprinkled dried granulated garlic onto the glazing, and then repositioned the skin back, covering the garlic/glaze. That's the only very minor change. Everything else was as stated and it is Oh, so good... Served on long grain white rice with broiled asparagus and a Chinese Cucumber salad. So simple, so affordable, so good.

Use your meat thermometer to bake this chicken perfectly and the sauce will do the rest. Delicious and easy! Reviewers who modified this recipe for skinless, boneless chicken got it right ~ great job! I will definitely make this one again and again.

This would be a good recipe with the addition of some cornstarch to thicken the sauce so that it will carmelize the chicken while baking.  As written, the sauce stays very thin and does not carmelize the meat.  I recommend mixing the sauce together in a saucepan and add in about 2 Tbsp. of cornstarch mixed with some water.  Once this thickens up it can be poured over the chicken to bake.  Also, I prefer using skinless, boneless breasts, thighs and drumsticks.  You'll get more of the sauce flavor if the skin is removed before cooking.

I have made this chicken three times and my husband and three year old son love it!  I used chicken legs with the skin removed and baste it every 15 min.  The sauce is great!

First off, I wouldn't follow the first recommended review that changes the ingredients to make the sauce thicker. I followed that the first few times and the sauce never thickened and had a bitter taste, but was 'okay'. Then one night I was in a hurry and ended up following the exact recipe and the sauce still didn't thicken, but tasted FANTASTIC. it really helped including more honey and less ketchup minus tabasco sauce. Just mixed together and poured over chicken without heating on stove. We can't get enough of that flavor!

I made this dish this past weekend--I cooked the sauce on the stove top like others suggested and used the same ingredients with the following change: added freshly grated ginger to the sauce and omitted the oil and salt and pepper from the sauce. I poured the sauce over the chicken and cooked at 375 degrees for 45 minutes covered with foil and then took the foil off and lowered the temperature to 350 degrees for another 20 minutes. the sauce thickened and carmelized and was oh so sticky. everyone loved it!

Delish! When served to company with basmati rice and broccoli they asked for seconds.  Precooked the sauce with 2 Tbls. cornstarch in 1/4 cup water until thickened, then poured it over the chicken before it went into the oven.  This should be good over pork too.  Thanks, Sandy.  This one is a keeper. ;)

Followed Crankerchick's instructions & used skinned chicken breasts.  My husband really enjoyed it! Stay by the stove when boiling the sauce.  It could easily boil over (it didn't because I kept an eye on it). This recipe is a keeper!

Simple 6 ingredient recipe that yields superb wings, but the only thing that should be modified is the baking instructions.  I baked them that way and the sauce dripped off leaving only a transparent film on the wings, which wasn't very tasty.  I made it again because I love the taste of the sauce, only this time using a technique I use for baby back ribs.  Let them marinate in the slow cookers 5-6 hours on low, pouring sauce over them every once in a while.  Then switch them to your broiler on an aluminum-foil-covered cookie sheet, and watch them closely, to bake them just enough so they're nice and crisp instead of slimey.  This takes me 5 to 10 minutes.  The flavour is so much more intense thanks to the slow cooker!

Good points-Easy to make, 9/10 ingredients on hand and it's chicken.
Bad points-I think it takes longer to have the sauce "caramelize or thicken." The sauce tastes like teriyaki if you like teriyaki. 

I reduced the honey to reduce the sweetness. Overall this recipe is overrated. I will not make it again.

This is a definite "go-to" recipe. It's easy but very flavorful! Changes based on other reviews: use 1/4 cup soy sauce (instead of 1/2 cup) & 1/2 cup honey (instead of 1 cup). Heat the marinade first and add a little cornstarch to thicken.When baking, turn chicken at the halfpoint & baste every 15 minutes.

I made this for dinner tonight and the family gave it a thumbs up -  even my 5 year old!  In reading some other reviews, I cut down the soy sauce to 1/4 cup and I'm glad I did or else it would've been to salty.  I used chicken breasts and should've cut down the time to 40 minutes, but the husband was late coming home, but it was still delicious.  The sauce was still runny, not caramelized, but the chicken was well coated and the sauce was excellent on the mashed potatoes.  Will definately keep this recipe and make it again!

Yummo! I added some cider vinegar to the mix along with my ususal garlic and onion powders. I then broiled the various chicken parts I had until the skin was nicely carmalized. (about ten minutes on each side) From there I put the chicken in the oven with the sauce.  Amazingly good recipe that my whole family loved! Thanks so much!

Really good - a nice change from the usual "buffalo" wings. I omitted the oil, because I felt that the wings would produce enough fat. I also broiled these for a few minutes at the end of the cooking time. I think omitting the oil & broiling helped these get crispy & carmelized (and not soggy). I made this recipe as well as the Candied Garlic Wings recipe from this site on the same night for a "taste test" - and we agreed that this one was better (more flavorful - must be the ketchup!)

This recipe wasn't as good as I tho't it would be. I skinned the chicken as one reviewer suggested.  I used thighs and legs and pierced the meat and turned it several times while baking. I'm not sure I would make this again as it didnot caramelize except around the edge of the dish and I had to open up windows and start the fan to disperse the strong smells in the house.

I am stretching here with 3 stars...but have to admit, part of the blame lies with me.  I followed others suggestions: cut back on the honey - added more garlic - I basted the chicken every 15 minutes to keep it from burning up.  But I used leg quarters instead of wings...and they looked wonderful (caramel colored) and smelled great too, but the skin was very slimmy - yuck. We had to take the skin off as it was not edible, but in doing so removed the flavor.  I also used thigh pieces and before cooking I removed the skin.  These pieces were much better, but beware of burning.  Without the skin and with the sugar in the honey, they are very likely burn.  And I hope you LOVE the smell of burnt soy and honey, because you'll smell it for hours! =))

I used 14 chicken wing drumettes with skins on. Like most reviewers, the drippings did not carmelize.  But the coating on the chicken browned nicely.  I took the left over sauce (left in the pan after cooking) and simmered it on the stove top (without cornstarch) and that carmelized it within 15 minutes.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was great. I took the advice of another reviewer and covered the pan with foil for the first 40 minutes; I am glad I did. I also added cornstarch to the pan juices when it was done to have some gravy. I will definitely make this again.

I tried this recipe for the first time last night. My husband is very picky when it comes to chicken wins and how they are prepared. It was absolutely delicous, he even called me at work this morning and asked me if I would prepare it again for dinner tonight. This one is a KEEPER !!

SO DELICIOUS. Added roasted sesame seeds to the sauce and rubbed the chicken with salt and pepper beforehand to marinate. No cover, and sauce caramelized perfectly in 1 hr. Took advice of a reviewer and broiled for a few minutes at the end, which was wonderful (just be careful not to burn it). I used chunks of skinless, boneless ch. breasts, but left in oven for 1hr anyway so sauce would thicken, and i ended up overcooking the chicken-- i'm going to try larger pieces stuffed with apple, and also with drumsticks for my barbecue-obsessed brother.

These wings were amazing! I followed other reviewer's suggestions and boiled the sauce with 2 tbsp cornstarch until it thickened up. Then i poured half of it on the wings, covered them with foil and baked for 40 mins. Took the foil off, flipped the wings over and covered with the remaining sauce and cooked uncovered for ten more minutes. They came out perfect, the whole family loved them.

I just made this chicken tonight and I thought it was great! The flavor is awesome and very unique. I halved the recipe and used a dash of garlic powder instead of minced garlic. I poured the sauce over one large chicken breast which was cut into pieces. I ate the chicken and sauce over rice. It was really yummy!

Wow, you nailed it! My mom made this all the time while growing up. And we always begged for it. Meredith has it spot on. Except a few things. Double it, add 1 tbs of ginger. No salt! Soy sauce has enough. Here is the key. Grab your party wings and marinate them all day. Then use the remaining marinade to baste the chicken. Yummy!

I followed the suggestions on how to make more sauce, which I was happy with.  I used boneless chicken breast, and cooked it for 40 min. at 350.  It came out dry, so I'll have to dry it again at a reduced time.  Overall, a tasty dish.

This is good. I tried it with boneless skinless breast and I will not do that again ( dry and soy sauce was over powering). with wings or legs it is great I think the fat in the skin has something to do with it good taste and not dry.

I consider myself a good cook that can follow directions and make good dishes......but this did not work for me.  It never carmalized and ended up a watery broth or something.  Maybe I should have read the reviews better and did like many and cooked the sauce on the stove top first.

I tried it with a teriyaki sauce instead of soy and it was wonderful. I do think that if you removed the fluid from the baking dish with about 20-25 minutes to go, it would crisp up and be even better.

Like others, I thickened the mixture with water and corn starch with the rest of the ingredients over very low heat for 10 minutes. I used drumsticks and chicken thighs. I covered the dish with aluminum foil which kept it from burning for the first 30 minutes. I had it another 15 minutes without cover, and 2 minutes on broil. I guess because I rotated the meat too often (every 15-20 minutes), i did not get the crust, rather it was semi-liquid thick mass which I did not mind. I will try to cook next time without flipping the meat.

I was trying to find something good to do with chicken wings and found this recipe. IT IS FANTASTIC!!! Left out the garlic by mistake but that was okay because I had to substitute Worcestershire sauce instead for soy sauce. This will be one of my "go to" recipes for wings from today on. Thank you Sandy!

After 40 minutes I drained most of the liquid and cooked another 20 minutes and they came out nice and caramelized...very good but next time I would like to make them a bit crispier

Very tender and moist.  The sauce didn't caramelize for me even with cooking it in a pot first.  Excellent flavor that wasn't too much like BBQ sauce, more reminiscent of a Chinese chicken.  Very good!

Really not my cup of tea...although my one son really liked it, no one else did.  I couldn't eat it, but the rest of my family was able to.  Don't think I will be making again.  Sorry.

Iappreciate this recipe, but because ofmy husband's needs will use Meridith's adjustments and as I have to eliminate salt where I can to keep in the catsup I'll use low sodium soy sauce, can't wait. Thanks

This is a great recipe.  I did boil the sauce first and then poured it over the chicken and it caramelized nicely while baking.  I used 5 boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I turned the breasts every 15 minutes just to really coat the chicken.    I served it with Teriaki noodles and salad.  This chicken was so good I ended up chopping up a breast and topping my salad with it and eating my salad without dressing.  I am bringing it as delicious chicken salad for lunch tomorrow.  This is a great sauce, you could use it on baked pork chops as well.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This chicken was really good.  I boiled the sauce mixture for about 10 minutes to thicken it up.  I added red pepper flakes for heat.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and it caramelized on them wonderfully.  Served with rice and stir fry veggies.  Yum!

This is delicious...I made a few adjustments though.  I added 2 tbsp brown sugar (cus I was 1/4 cup short on honey) and 1tsp ground ginger (seemed like a good idea).  After baking the leg quarters for an hour the sauce was very thin so I removed the chicken to add 2 tbsp of cornstarch liquid to thicken the sauce.  I returned the chicken to the pan and baked for another 20 minutes uncovered.  OMG!!! My hubby and 3 yr old daughter gobbled everthing up.  I served with some simple brown rice.  I will definitely make this again...I wonder how this will turn out in the crockpot???

I used 6 skinless chicken thighs and roasted at 400 degrees for 40 minutes- I mixed 2 TBSP of the reserved sauce with 2 TBSP sour cream as a side dipping sauce- delicious!

I made this recipe from a Company's Coming cookbook and it is delicious.  Even better if you marinade the chicken for the day.  You can use the extra sauce over rice.

I did not like the flavor and in order to get it to caramelize by leaving it in the oven that long made the chicken dry.

This was so good. To make them sticky I baked them covered for 30 mins and then flipped the chicken over and baked another 20 mins covered and took the cover off and drained the extra sauce and cooked uncovered for 10 more minutes. This made these sticky and perfect! A great dinner recipe or Asian style wings.

Really good recipe.  Followed advice of reviewer Meredith (sort reviews and by most helpful) and used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of wings.  Yummy sauce! Served with fried potatoes and fresh tomatoes. Perfect companion dishes.

This is a great recipe. It tasted good. I did need to add some cayenne pepper to it to balance out the sweetness a bit. I was also expecting the sauce to thicken but it never did. Beware of how long you cook the chicken. Mine was done in 40 minutes at 375 degrees using legs and thighs. Next time I plan on marinating the chicken overnight then throwing it all in the oven again. This would also be an excellent glaze for grilled meats.

This was so simple to make and tasted very good. I used boneless chicken breasts and baked them at 400 for 20ish minutes. I cooked the sauce on top of the stove for 10 minutes first, and added some cornstarch...it got nice and thick. The kids really liked it.

My first attempt at this recipe was a total failure. I did not have enough honey and for some strange reason I didnt think that wasnt going to affect the flavor of the dish and obviously it was way too salty. But of course that was my fault. I made this last night and Im so glad I gave it another shot cause it was delish. I used Bloneless/Skinless chicken breast and served with chicken fried rice. It was so good. Thanks again.

Both myself and my wife LOVE this recipe! Its so simple to make... just mix the sauce... baste the chicken and bake it. Especially delicious with an ice cold beer on the side.... the only tip I would offer that's not in the directions is to flip your wings, breasts or whatever you prefer halfway through cooking. It gets much more of the sauce this way baked onto it, and thus more flavor. Personally I also make 1 1/2 times the sauce it calls for so I have extra to baste the chicken while it cooks. Mmmmmmmmmmmm good!

YUM!! I realized as I was getting the ingredients out that I didn't have any soy sauce, so I used balsamic vinegar instead (I also left out the ketchup).  It was unbelievable! I sprinkled the chicken with sesame seeds before putting it in the oven, then served it with jasmine rice and steamed broccolli.  My kids kept asking for more.  I went out and bought a huge bottle of soy sauce so I can make it again!

Wonderful recipe. Flavors went very well together. I used a whole chicken cut up instead of just wings and flipped the pieces half way through baking.

This was a great recipe! The sauce is very easy to prepare, I followed the recipe exactly, I didn't cook the sauce before and found that it didn't carmelize very well - more of a teriyaki glaze.  However - even without the carmelizing the chicken came out tender (I used boneless skinless breasts as well)and the smell of the chicken baking was wonderful!!  I found a couple of drops of hot sauce was all I needed to kick this recipe up a little - picky fiance loved it, mentioned it would be good sliced in a salad!!

This has got to be one of the best chicken recipes on this site and it's super easy!  I read past reviews that complained about the sauce not carmelizing, so I added corn starch to the sauce and boiled it down, then poured it over the chicken.  I used 1/2 a whole chicken (legs and wings) and I have to say, you NEED to use wings only, it tasted much better than the legs (though the legs weren't bad themselves).  Other than that, followed the recipe to the t.  Thanks.

I thought this would be delicious the moment I read it, and was I ever right! My husband and kids gobbled this up so fast! I will definately make it again. I didn't get sticky but was an excellent marinade for the chicken to bake in! I might try it next time without the olive oil to see if it gets stickier.

I used chicken breast pieces and cooked the mixture a little before adding it to the chicken and it still didn't carmelize well.  I might try it again with more cooking of the mixture and less cooking of the chicken.

This recipe is great!  I used it on a whole roasting chicken.  Being that it needed to bake for almost 2 hours, the sauce definitely caramalized, and actually got a little too dark in the end, so next time I'll hold back about half an hour until I put it on the chicken.  I did baste and that made a nice thick coating.  WARNING:  MESSY clean-up, so use a foil liner or a disposable pan!

I made this for my husband & son. So easy to prepare, & it's guarantee well done after 1 hour in the oven.  They taste good out of the oven & even better the next day after heating up in the microwave oven.

It was ok.  I used chicken breast instead of wings.  That may have been the problem

I made this exactly like the recipe called for and thought it was FABULOUS!! 
I am making it again tonight for dinner and doing the same BUT I am adding red pepper flakes and sesame seeds and serving it with roasted veggies (broccoli, onion, water chestnuts) with white rice. Amazing!

Outstanding, and my husband loved. The only change I made was to mix sticky mixture in a sauce pan and add 2tlbs of corn starch. Bring mixture to boil stiring until thickened. Pour mixture over wings before placing in the oven.

So delicious! I too altered it somewhat.  Made the sauce with 3/4 cup each of ketchup and honey. 1/2 cup soy sauce. 2 TBSP veg oil, 3 cloves garlic and a few dashes of red pepper flakes.  Cooked over medium high heat on the stovetop with approx. 1 TBSP corn starch til thick and bubbly.  Poured over halved bone in chicken breasts and baked at 375 til done.  Sauce still got rather thin, so after I removed chicken from oven, I poured the sauce in a small saucepan and reduced on high until thick.  Pour over chicken and YUM!!! Nothing left :-)

I used chicken breast & cooked the sauce on the stove to thicken as recommended.  Overall, came out good & I enjoyed the taste.  I was browsing recipes for different unique ways to cook chicken breasts when I came across this one.   Wish the sauce carmelized a bit more, but overall it was pretty good.  May make again in the future.  Thanks for sharing ;)

I made this tonight with boneless breast chicken following Meredith's adjustments and it came out beautifully ! It was so delicious over white rice. My husband started talking about the "next time I make it" before he was even finished with this time lol.  I would love to see the author revise the recipe to include the need to boil the sauce first.  Then it would get the 5 star rating it deserves, since the problem those that gave low scores had was with the caramelizing process.   I will definitely be making this the next time I have guest for dinner.  (Oh and lining the pan with tin foil sure made clean up effortless)

This recipe was simply amazing!!! I only used half a cup of honey because that was all i had left and i used thighs.  My entire family loved it. I followed it as written, and it wasnt very thick as some people  had noted. All i did was mix some corn starch with water and mix it in with the baking chicken. Bake for another 20 minutes or so and it will thicken right up. I really thought this was so good. So flavorful.

I wouldn't make this again. It was way too sweet and the chicken did not crisp up. The sauce when it came out looked like tar, and was incredbly sticky.

I would use lite soy sauce and less honey. Too sweet otherwise. 45 mins in 190' C was perfect. Chicken was tender and juicy.

I never have used the oil nor actual garlic, only garlic powder and this is always so good! My dh says to give it 7 stars. Its not too sweet when you use equal parts honey and ketchup, and its not too messy when you use a disposable pan. I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS CHICKEN!!!

After reading the other reviews, I cooked the sauce on the stove first. Even so, the chicken came out soupy....  NOT caramelized at all. Didn't care for the flavor either. I really don't know how this got so many rave reviews.

I used less soy sauce as some other reviewers suggested and ran out of honey so only had enough for 2/3 cup and I also boiled the sauce on the stove top before pouring over chicken breasts. Over all it semi carmalized and made lots of sauce. The chicken turned out moist and delicious. I think next time I will thicken the sauce with some cornstarch as per reviews and only do half the amount.

This had a really good flavor but did not cook down as written. Next time I will follow the suggestion of fellow reviewers and reduce the sauce by cooking on stovetop prior to pouring over the top. I was using leg quarters (skin & bones) so cooking the sauce first is still necessary. But, great flavor, thanks for the recipe!

I wish I wasn't saying this, but it was not what I was expecting.  I was really thinking it was going to be a sticky carmalized coating.  I adjusted the quanities as some had said.  I cooked it on the stove to thicken it before pouring over chicken but it never thickened and I cooked it for a loonngggg time. I poured it over and baked and checked on it and the juice that stayed on the top did bake into the chicken but not like it looks in the picture. The taste was ok.  The thin sauce gave it moisture and mild taste. IF I make it again, I will cut back to maybe 1/2 cup for the 3/4 that was mentioned.

I followed other reviews and adjusted the sauce for skinless boneless chicken breasts by boiling the ingredients and adding 2 tbsp cornstarch.  Baked for 40 mins on 350 degrees.  We loved the flavor and juiciness of the chicken.  Absolutely delicious!  I will definitely make this again.

I followed the recipe exactly, not having read any of the reviews.  The sauce was completely running and didn't "stick" to the chicken at all.  Now that I see the comments everyone has made on boiling the sauce first or using corn starch to thicken, I may try again.  I highly suggest AllRecipes update the original recipe to produce something closer to the result pictured.  With the runny sauce, the chicken was okay, but nothing special.

Easy and delicious! I have been looking for recipes that I can use chicken thighs with (they are so much cheaper than chicken breasts) and this one really fit the bill. I added a little extra garlic and my husband two boys loved it.

This was very tasty. I did use boneless chicken breasts, cut into thick chunks, so I modified the sauce recipe according to the top commenter on here. I boiled the sauce and then poured it over the chicken meat. This was supposed to be thicker, but it wasn't. It tasted amazing, however. Next time, I am going to try to "thicken" the sauce with a little bit of flour, if the caramelization doesn't occur.

My family and I loved the flavor of the glaze and will make again.  I used boneless chicken breast and found there to be too much sauce to get a good carmelizing affect.  I did cook the sauce before adding it to the chicken.  I added a bit of brown sugar as well. Next time I will use half of the sauce and baste during the baking.  Overall good recipe and will use again.

I marinate the breasts in the mixture for a couple of hours and only use 1/2 the marinade mixture and it's more than enough for 4 boneless breasts.  Then I grill it on the bbq....to die for!  I also add a pinch of ginger.

Used drumsticks and thought it tasted great. The sauce never thickened up for me though.Maybe some cornstartch or minute tapioca would've helped.I'll try this again; everyone liked the taste.

Great recipe! I flipped the chicken around halfway through (I use drumsticks) and I added a little bit of OJ and garlic to the recipe. Tastes great! Also, leaving a bit of sauce aside to thicken on the stovetop is a good idea, but the chicken has so much flavor that it doesn't really need the extra sauce.

This tasted similar to my teriyake chicken recipe, but it used simple ingredients. I used breasts, and just cooked the sauce on the stove to thicken it up a bit before pouring over the chicken. Then just baked it, basting once. Quick, easy and very good. Thanks!!

this was delicious! even though i cooked it 375 for an hour it was a tiny bit dry so next time i'll do 45 minutes.
for less sweet flavor, do equals amounts of ketchup and honey (instead of more honey)

Simply amazing sauce! I added red pepper flakes for a little kick and also added cornstarch and boiled it for a couple of minutes to make it nice and thick. I dredged my wings in cornstarch/seasonings and then deep fried. These turned out incredibly crunchy and with the sauce they were better than any restaurant wings I've ever had. SO AMAZING!!!

I can't say I'm sold on this recipe.  Wasn't able to get all the sauce to thicken up and stay on the chicken.  Also, the leftovers had a "gamey" taste that I just cound't stomach.  I'll give it 3 stars only because I can see it has potential with some tweaks.  I don't try new recipes and tweak them from the start.  It isn't helpful to readers if you rate a recipe that you've revised, in my opinion, and it downgrades the effectiveness of the entire rating system.

This was a hit, even with my very picky eater (10yr old son).  I added a little extra garlic just because we LOVE garlic, but otherwise did not alter the ingredients.  I followed the suggestion of others and made the sauce on the stovetop first - bringing it to a rolling boil then immediately removing from heat and pouring over the chicken.  I used 2lbs chicken wings and 1lb chicken drumettes (my son prefers those over wings) and baked at 400 degrees in a clear glass dish for about 25-30 mins, turning and basting chicken once half way through, and basting only again about 5 minutes before they were done.  Will DEFINITELY make again, as these were sticky, flavorful, easy, and a hit!

After reading the reviews I was tempted  to change up the recipe but I went ahead and made it as is and my sauce never caramelized onto the skin on the chicken, in fact the skin seemed to absorb all the salt from the soy sauce (I added no extra salt at all) and the meat itself was lacking flavour, except when I dipped it into the remaining sauce which I ended up thickening with cornstarch. On another note, the sauce itself had flavour past the saltiness of the soy sauce when I dipped the meat into it but overall, this was a "just okay" recipe for me.

It was good, but in my opinion, I could've accomplished the same flavor by pouring a bottle of bbq sauce over it.  Probably won't make this again.

Yum-O!  I made 6 legs, 6 wings and 2 boneless breasts (which I cut in half).  I wanted to see how each part would turn out.  While pre-baking the legs a little (BF likes them very done), I simmered my sauce on the stove top for about 15 mins, to which I added 2T cornstarch in 2T water.  It thickened up nicely.  Put chicken into a glass 9x13 baking dish; seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic and onion powder, plus a sprinkle of poultry seasoning on the skinless breast meat.  Poured the sauce over all the pieces and tossed it into the oven.  I checked it after about 20 mins and found the sauce was bubbling and getting really thick, which scared me because I knew I  had a while to go, so I covered the dish with foil.  Mistake.  In only about 15 mins, it caused the sauce to become very thin again so I removed the foil.  Next time, I will leave it uncovered and turn it down a little if its cooking too fast.  The house smelled wonderful.  I turned the pieces 3-4 times, was worried the breast meat would dry out, and it probably would have if I hadn't kept turning it.  Baked for the full hour and it all came out perfectly, very tender and delicious!  Loved the flavor.   Thanks for a great new recipe to add to my collection.

This recipe did not work for me. Too much sauce and too watery.  I ended up draining out most of the sauce to see if I could get the chicken to get a nice coating in the end. No dice.

Simple, delicious and quick to make.  I made this last night as follows:   I used approximately 3.5 lbs of chicken drumsticks.  I seasoned the chicken on both sides with Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Black Pepper and Celery Seed.  I also used about 3 Tbs. of Minced Garlic (from the jar) and included about 1 Tbs of the Garlic/Water Juice in the mixture.  I also added 1 Tbs. of Red Pepper Flakes.  I mixed all ingredients together in a pot and boiled for about 7 minutes in an attempt to thicken the sauce based on previous reviews.    I cooked the chicken for approximately 45 minutes covered with aluminum foil, then turned the chicken and cooked for another 30 minutes covered.  I then uncovered, turned once again and let cook for 15 minutes with the cover removed.   The sauce did not come out as thick as I would have liked, as I did not have corn starch on hand.  Next time I will add the corn starch as suggested.  Otherwise, very good.  My kids and hubby liked it as well.

Delicious recipe...The only thing I did different was to boil my sauce and add about 2 tablespoons cornstarch with about 4 tablespoons water and broil for about 3 to 4 minutes after chicken is done....Thanks for the recipe!!

If I change something about a recipe, I always give it an extra star.  That being said, my result was really worth 3 stars.  I used this coating for breast tenders.  I followed others advice and cooked the coating on the stove top for about 20 minutes.  It didn't thicken up like I thought it would.  After I baked the chicken, the only thing that stuck to it was the soy sauce.  The flavor was ok but not something I would make again, even on wings.  I don't think it would make any difference what piece of chicken I put the coating on.  I guess it worked for a lot of people, but for some reason, not me!

This was good and easy!  I did use chicken breast so it watered it down a little, but I just reserved some sauce until the last 5 minutes of cooking and slabbed it on top and it caramelized beautifully.

Easy and tasty...I made dish as written but will probably sprinkle a little brown sugar on top the last 15 min of baking, to make a thicker glaze next time. Adding red pepper flakes would be a great addition next time too.

My daughter took the first bite and said "This is the best chicken you have ever made!"  I used 1 package of chicken legs so I had to adjust the measurements.  I only baked for 45 minutes and turned chicken over half way through.  I will make again, but will cover my dish with foil before baking.  I have a huge, sticky mess to clean up in the pan!!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was DELICIOUS!!!!!  To get the true carmelized effect on the chicken I baked for 50 minutes at 375 degrees and for 10 minute bumped my oven up to "broil" I took the chicken out of the oven and let it sit for a couple minutes before serving. This allowed the sauce to set up a bit and it was OUTSTANDING. The only thing I changed about the recipe was to use boneless skinless chicken breasts versus the wings which I didn't have in my freezer. Overall, this is SUCH a fabulous glaze for chicken. I am going to try it on baked salmon next!  Make it! You will LOOOOVE it!

This is soooo good!!! My husband kids, and I love it=) I did notice that the sauce didn't thicken after baking. So the next time I made it, I added 1 tabl. corn starch to the sauce, poured it over the chicken, and baked as directed. It turned out wonderful! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I made this last night for our family...what a hit!!  The whole family (husband, picky 7YO and 3YO) loved it.  I made approx. 30 wings, served with thai noodles and we ate it all!  I followed other's recommendations and boiled the sauce (3/4 c. honey, 1/2 c lite soy sauce, 1/2 c ketchup, 2 tsp of minced garlic, 1 tsp olive oil whisked together) on the stove and added 1 tbsp of cornstarch.  I cooked the wings covered @ 350 for 45 mins, removed the cover, added the sauce and cooked for an add'l 15-20 mins.  The sauce still was not super thick, but the wings were delicous!!  No one even questioned the sauce and when I suggested that I would work on the sauce next time, they begged me not to change a thing!  LOL!!  Highly recommend this recipe if you're looking for yummy wings.

Delicious!  Followed meredith's suggestion and  made the sauce thick for boneless chicken breasts.  It came out perfect.  I made this with 2 other recipes from this site, the bacon and cheddar stuffed mushrooms and orange cilantro rice.  Everything was wonderful!

I'm beginning to love these throw-everything-in-your-kitchen-together sauces!  I used chicken tenders and Worcestershire sauce instead of sauce because I don't usually have soy on hand.  The last five minutes of so I placed under my broiler.  This is really, very good.

Good flavor.  Chicken was tender when hot, but leftovers were tough the next day.  I'll make it again.  Don't over cook it.

Other than using legs and breasts, I followed the recipe to the T. I was concerned about the sauce at first because it was so thin and forgot to thicken it on the stove like so many reviewers suggested before putting it on the chicken. Didn't have a problem though. As the chicken was baking the sauce was thickening in the pan. Turned and basted the chicken about every 15 mins. Came out very thick at the end of baking for an hour. The soy sauce was very evident, but not offputting. May add some brown sugar next time to make it a little sweeter. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good sauce, although I took another reviewer's suggestion to modify the catsup ,honey and garlic  measurements for boneless, skinless chicken breasts and boil the sauce to caramelize before baking. My picky 15 year-old son said they were really good, and he and his father both requested having chicken wings this Superbowl Sunday with the same sauce. I'll definitely be making this chicken on a regular basis...I served it with Jasmine rice and had no leftovers! Thanks for a great recipe!!! :)

I made this with chicken thighs for dinner which was a big mistake. It's probably much better with wings at a potluck. I made it exactly, and it was way too sweet...lucky I had plenty of rice to tone it down a bit. I wondered about that cup of honey...

I have made this recipe several times.  If you don't have honey try substituting Apricot jam.  I also add a Tablespoon of Siracha sauce for heat and more of a asian flavor.

Tasty and juicy.  I used chicken breasts.  Cooked sauce on stove for 15 minutes, then baked at 400 for 20 minutes.

Very good, however to get the sauce thick and caramelized I had to boil it down and add cornstarch (did this after I pulled the chicken out of the oven).  Then poured the sauce back over the chicken and broiled for a couple minutes and it got nice and gooey.  It reminded me and my husband of a dish from a chinese restaurant.

MMmmmm this is great recipe!!! I made this using the wingetts and drummetts and it came out perfect. It has lots of juices and oils from cooking, so remember to drain it for the last 10 or 15 minutes of baking. This would be great for parties and get togethers. Can't wait to make it again =)

I tried this exactly as the recipe states. I used leg and thigh pieces since that's what I had.   I didn't season the chicken as some reviewers suggested. I actually took the chicken and sauce out of the oven 10 minutes early and put the sauce in a pot with 2 tablespoons of flour to thicken. Then I added the chicken and let it simmer for about 10min.  Paired with some garlic mashed potatoes and this was a pretty amazing meal.  *Note: I would use a little less honey next time because a cup was too sweet for me.

This was excellent. I was so surprised how good this was, considering the simple ingredients. Two boneless skinless, 400, 30 minutes, basting every 10. Yes, make the larger sauce and boil it down. Served with chipotle mashed sweet potatoes and sauteed leeks.

I made this tonight with boneless, skinless chicken breasts, adding cornstarch and cooking the sauce on the stovetop first. It was delicious... and kid-approved!! I served it with rice and it was a big hit! Thanks for a terrific and easy recipe!

YUM!  This was awesome!  I only had 1/4 cup of soy sauce left but I made it anyway and it was GREAT.  I also used two cloves of minced garlic instead of one. DEFINITE keeper - this one is going into rotation.  :)

I made exactly as written, but used a whole chicken bone-in pieces instead of just wings. The pieces with the skin intact, carmelized beautifully making presentation very, very nice for company. I did not cover, did not turn However, I DID baste about every 15 minutes and left in a the oven (turned off) for about a half hour longerm after my chicken was donem while I stir-fried some snow peas & matchstick carrots to go with. Similar, but much less overpowering soy flavor than a Teriyaki. LOVED the chicken cut up over rice with the veggies and sauce all together. Will make again FOR SURE intentionally using more than wings and "all mixed up".

I modified this per other reviews and my own taste and it was finger licking good. It may be just as awesome without changes, but I'll tell you what I did in case you want to try. I increased the sauce by using 2/3 cup of low sodium soy/tamari sauce and tripling the catsup and garlic, but I didn't add the oil to the sauce. I used leg quarters with the bones in (4 pounds) and simmered them in the sauce covered on the stovetop for about 25 minutes, turning every few minutes. Then I put the chicken into an oiled baking pan (prettier side down,)  sparingly poured a little of the sauce over top and baked at 425 degrees. While baking I added a corn starch/water mixture to the sauce to thicken it and brought it to a boil for a minute stirring constantly. It didn't need salt.  I added a good dash of cayenne and it needed a little more zip so I added a few tablespoons of rice wine vinegar. It was about time to turn the chicken when this was done (about 10 minutes.)  I turned the chicken and ladled a generous amount of sauce over each peice, but reserved about a cup for later. Baked it another 10 minutes.  Ladled extra sauce over the top of each peice to serve. (Plain brown rice mixed with peas was an excellent side choice.)

I cooked the chicken for the hour as stated but it was WAY over cooked.  I am sure it is because I had smaller wings but it was just gross, very rubbery and tough.  I liked the sauce though.  I think next time I might velvet the chicken before cooking it in the oven.  Velveting is a great Chinese technique to insure moist chicken in case you haven’t heard of it before. You cover the raw chicken with egg whites and corn starch then quickly dip it into boiling water for 60 seconds. Then you go ahead and cook the chicken the way you wanted… grill, oven, sauté, etc. This really does make for that moist Chinese like chicken!

Quite sweet...tasty though! I added a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes (we like spicy!) and the heat gave a nice edge to the sweetness.  Took advice from others and poured sauce out of pan after baking into a small saucepan to thicken (this only took about two minutes!)  Poured sauce over chicken, rice and some steamed veggies  - yum!

I read the reviews about the sauce being too thin and covered the chicken while it was baking. I also turned the chicken twice during the hour. It carmelized nicely on the chicken for sticky, tasty wings!

I am a little disappointed in this recipe.  The sauce didn't caramelize.  I took the tip of cooking it on the stove for 15 min first and it still was pretty watery.  It is more like a marinade.  The taste isn't terrible but reminds me of bottled honey garlic marinade.  The chicken does turn out a nice color, but I prefer a thicker sauce.  Sorry but I don't think I'll try this again, thanks anyway.

This recipe is fabulous, I made these wings for Superbowl Sunday, and the plate was cleared within minutes. The only change I made was to use lite (low sodium) soy sauce. I did roll them around in the sauce 1/2 way thru baking. They came out wonderfully sticky and tasty. Will definetely make these again.

Simple dish that had my picky children asking for more, and more.  Make sure to stir wings around every 20 mins or so to evenly coat.  Definitely a keeper, thanks.

We love this!  Use any pieces you want!  I turn/baste a few times until the end....you need to let this bake uncovered for the full hour (or more) to get carmelized.  Very yummy and this is why I make sure to always have honey on hand; just in case.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts. I loved the flavor of the glaze. It was delicious. I did add about a teaspoon of crushed red pepper and an extra clove of garlic to add a little more zip. When I make it again I will use chicken with the skin on like the recipe calls for. I think the sauce will caramelize better and the chicken will stay more moist.

These were really good! Just like teryaki chicken wings! The trick to these is you need to flip them in the sauce, Id say every 10 minutes or so to make sure they are coated in the sauce as the sauce gets thicker and thicker and also to prevent from burning twords the end. Once I figured that out, they came out perfect and we just LOVED them. I will make these again for sure.

I loved the taste.  I would definately speed up the camelizing process though.  I didn't have honey on hand, so I substituted with Karo Syrup (Maple syrup if you don't have karo).  I'm going to try a little variation and put a touch of Cayenne Pepper in the mix for a spicy sweet combo.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made this with chicken breasts (on the bone). It did not carmelize either. My family really loved it and said it's a keeper. After it came out of the oven I took it off the bone and mixed it with the sauce so it was more flavorful. The sauce was very watery so next time I may try the corn starch to make it thicker.

My family really liked these wings.  But after reading some of the reviews I made a few changes.
I increased the ketchup to 4 Tablespoons omited the olive oil as the wings have enough fat.  They did not caramelize which most of the reviews mentioned.  When my wings were done I mixed 2 Tablespoons cornstarch and 2 Tablespoons water and mixed with the wings thickened sauce right up also cooked in the bottom of a broiler pan and turned twice during baking.  They turned out great!!!!!!!!!!

I was intrigued by this recipe by the scads of positive reviews, coupled with the cheap and somewhat plebian ingredients. After trying it, I must add my voice to the chorus of those that love it. Easy to make, easy to revise, ingredients that are almost always on hand, and a quite impressive outcome. Who could ask for more?
If you like this recipe, I would recommend the Adobo Chicken recipe as well.  Thanks for sharing a great, simple recipe!

Really tasty! Like so many others have mentioned, the sauce didn't carmelize for me either, but it stuck to the wings enough to make them just right. Nevertheless, expect the remaining sauce to be like water when you take the wings out of the oven. 

I added two extra cloves of garlic, used slightly less honey, and added a tablespoon of BBQ sauce. 

After baking, I poured the remaining sauce into tupperware, and I'll be using it with some chicken thighs in the next couple of days! In other words, I'll definitely be making this again. Thank you for sharing it with us, Sandy!

The chicken was overcooked by the time the sauce started to carmelize. Next time, I would boil the sauce down in a pan on the stovetop and then use it like barbeque sauce once thickened.

This recipe was awesome!  I took it to a potluck party and they were gone before I could get one!  I used a bit more garlic (4 cloves) and had many people wanting the recipe.  It was simple and tasty!

I'm quite liry of trying new things, but this turned out very tasty! I'm really not a fan of honey, so I think next time I will not use that much honey. Oh, instead of using wings, I used legs and thighs. Don't be afraid, just try it.

This was really a great dish.  My son eats NO food or meat with a "sweet" flavor, and he had seconds on this.  I doubled the sauce and now have a great instant marinade in a jar in my fridge.  I added lots of garlic and a tablespoon of ginger paste to the sauce.  I, too, couldn't get the sauce to caramelize in the oven; so I spooned some out of the dish and reduced it in a sauce pan on med-hi heat for 10 min. Very yummy.  One warning...be careful what you touch in your kitchen I had sticky sauce all over the place and on my self! But it was well worth it.

I tried this recipe for the first time and did not like it.  One hour is too long and the sauce burnt, which was a sticky mess to clean up.  I might try it one more time and reduce the cooking time to see if it turns out any better.

I have been making these wings since 2001. Awesome recipe! Don't change a thing. They are quick, easy and extremely tasty. They always disappear quickly at parties and get togethers. What more could you want? Tip...Bake in a glass pan for quicker caramelization. I turn them over halfway through baking so that they absorb the sauce on both sides. YUMMY!

Good recipe. I have another recipe that is slightly similar. Make sure you baste this occasionally. I poured off all the extra liquid during the last 10 minutes of baking. Helped make it more carmelized.  I would make this again.

I used chicken thighs that I had. It took about two hours for 4 1/2 lbs. It was so quick, easy and delicious. My husband and kids loved it. I served it with rice, and they already asked me to make it again!!!!!!

This recipe is awesome. I love it! Though if you're watching your cholesterol, you may one to get rid of some of the skin. I didn't use the original recipe but the one from Meredith. I'm going to post it here so y'all don't have to find it: "3/4 cup katsup 3/4 honey 1/2 soy 3-4 cloves garlic 1/2 teaspoon tabasco cook the mixture on the stove top until boiling and reduce heat. Pour on top of chicken and bake at 350 for 35-40 minutes." I suggest you should bake the chicken for 40-50 minutes though. 35 might not be enough. Enjoy!

The flavor is delicious! The only reason I'm only giving 3 stars is because of the adjustments I will make the next time I make this. First, I didn't have wings, so I used chicken breasts. Second, I marinaded the breasts for about 9 hours prior to cooking. Third, next time I will cook for 30 minutes at 430 degrees so the chicken is more tender. Last, I'll stop halfway through cooking to baste the chicken with the juices in the pan to allow for more flavor to stick to the chicken.

I made this recipe exactly as it says. It was delicious! My husband and both of my boys all liked it (that never happens!). The sauce was a little thinner than I expected and didn't exactly caramelize, but still clung to the wings. The one change I will make for next time will be to use wingettes instead of full wings. Very sticky and messy to eat, so keep some hand wipes near by :) This will be a regular dish at our house.

I LOVE the flavor in this. My only complaint was that the chicken turned out very dry. (I used chicken breast) However, browsing through the comments I confirmed that covering the chicken prior to baking it does not change anything other than the chicken's moisture in the end.

The taste was great however, I ended up adding red pepper flakes to make it spicier and I would also in the future add cornstarch to the sauce to make it thicker.  It did not stick to the chicken as I wanted it to but it was good to have on top of the  rice.   This is a good recipe the, flavors were great, I just need to tweak it to my liking.

I will definitely give this another try. I followed the directions, but subbed in drumsticks because I had them on hand. It just didn't turn out as I expected. The recipe sounds good and I will give it another try with wings next time.

There were no leftovers tonight.  I made it with chicken thighs instead of wings.  The smell while cooking was so good, and everyone loved it.  This super easy recipe will be a keeper.

I had drumsticks and chicken thighs (bone in and skin on) on hand.  Based on other reviews I doubled the sauce, boiled on stovetop - add 2 tbs cornstarch to thicken, then cover chicken and bake covered for 45 mins and uncovered for 15 more (can increase temp to 400-425).  Delicious!!!  I also ran out of honey so I used molasses and then added some maple syrup to lighten the flavor.

Delicious sauce.  I made it according to modifications of meredith: no oil (I think the chicken adds enough oil, even skinless), extra catsup, more garlic (!) and slightly less honey. I didn't have tabasco so added about a tsp of siraccha sauce. I did boil the sauce but not for long and I would say it didn't thicken. Maybe I need to simmer longer? Cooked it on skinless chicken thighs.  Served over jasmine rice with sauce. Husband and son loved this and inhaled it!  I would say to thicken add a tad of cornstarch before boiling sauce.  My suggestion would be to use lower salt soy sauce but no complaints from my boys.  I will definitely make this again. It is super good and super easy!  Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely fabulous!  Will be part of our regular meals!  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and they were delicious!  Will be trying it with a pork tenderloin next.  Thanks for the stellar recipe!

This was perfect and delicious and I did not change the recipe at all!  I did not heat the sauce, or add cornstarch or more ketchup (or any of those suggestions made by others) and these wings were perfect–tender, with a nice sticky-crispy skin. I have the photo to prove it (you can see it on my profile)This recipe is geared for CHICKEN WINGS with bone and skin. You can't expect this recipe written as is to work with boneless, skinless chicken breasts. The skin is what aids in the caramelization and the size of the wings with their bones (I used whole wings, tucking in the tips behind the drumette) is just right for cooking the full hour needed. 

Make sure your oven is 375 degrees. I used an oven thermometer and when I noticed my oven wasn't to temperature, I made adjustments and the caramelization began soon after. I did turn them at the half way point and so allowed a little extra time to account for the heat loss that happens every time you open the door. Have patience and follow the recipe and you won't be disappointed.

I have made this two ways.  With and without the skin.  I am a skin-on guy as it imparts so much flavor to the dish.  In deference to the writer I also tried it skinless.  No comparison.  With the skin is soooo much more tasty.
As to boneless - bone in as chicken wings (mini drumsticks) are meant to be eaten with hands not a knife and fork.  The bone gives a 'handle' with which to eat them.

This turned out pretty good. I used some brown sugar and less honey. Honey is way too expensive to dump so much on some chicken.

Great stuff. Made with boneless breast - browned on the stove to save oven time. Also cooked sauce on stove adding cornstarch to thicken.  30 minutes covered and 5 minutes uncovered to caramelize. Came out very tender and super tasty.

I liked the flavour but was disappointed that it wasn't as sticky and caramelized as I would have liked.  I feel like I could have bought a bottle of sauce at the grocery store and gotten the same results.  The family liked the flavours though.

Nice and bubbley! The chicken is so tender. Meat peels right off. Had to have a fork cause they were so tender. So what if the sauce didn't completely caramelize. Taste is sweet but not too sweet. We have already refridgerated and reheated.... Still Tender!! and Juicy!!

I was only cooking for 2, two thighs and a drumstick, so I cut the recipe in half.  I did not have any garlic, but i had a jar of oriental garlic chili sauce, i also had no olive oil, but i did have some ghee on hand and used that instead.  I used 1 tablespoon of the chili garlic sauce which gave just enough kick, the sauce was a bit sweet, which my husband did not mind. The chili garlic sauce was definitely a good substitution and will keep that in.

I will definitely make this again, but the next time, i am going to use wings, i can see this being a new party favorite

This recipe is ok, next time I will add stuff to make it a little less sweet. The sauce did not caramelize at all. It was still runny like water even after baking on the stove for 15 minutes and adding corn starch. I will add more corn starch next time as well.

This recipe was ok. I made it as directed but I did cook the sauce before putting it on the chicken. It was nicely thick but it was the flavor that weird. Not bad just really different. Thanks for the recipe!

This was sooooo good and very easy. I really enjoyed it and will make it again. However, I cut the recipe in half and substituted 4 chicken thighs for the wings. If you do this, be sure the thighs are "bone-in" and still have the skin, otherwise the sauce won't caramelize. It's yummy good!!

Had to add corn starch and boil down sauce separately.I found the sauce sweet and boring. I added cayenne as well as a half a envelope of French onion soup mix to shake things up. Turned out good. Like a honey onion sauce.

My husband LOVED this dish!!  I followed it to the letter (except I forgot to add the olive oil).  I used chicken thighs and two chicken breasts for those that don't eat chicken off the bone.  The thighs were perfectly cooked with the temp and time stated.  The breasts were slightly dry, although the sauce made up for it, but I would reduce time and temp for boneless breasts.  Next time, I will do as other reviewers said which was boil the sauce down to make it thicker or add the cornstarch to thicken.  The sauce was rather thin, but still delicious.  Pour over buttered, garlic noodles or rice and it is fantastic.  And the leftovers???? the glaze just gets stickier and more delicious, if possible. An option would be to chop up some chives or green onion for serving or cut up the chicken into pieces with the sauce as is and serve over a bed of rice. (kind of like the bourbon chicken from the mall, you know, the ones with the samples?)

I made this using the listed ingredients but started with fresh wings skin side down on tin foil on a baking sheet.  I poured the sauce over them baked them 20 minutes then flipped them and baked another 40 minutes.  Best wings I ever made.  I had 4 of them left so I packed them up for my lunch the next day.  Got in the fridge the next morning to get them and noticed the empty dish in the sink.  Just my husband and I living here.  He swears with a smirk that it was not him.

Pretty good.  I followed the first reviewers advice to make the sauce thicker.  It was still not very thick, but pretty good.  I may make again, but not one of my favorites.

This was pretty good. I used a whole chicken that I cut up, and followed others' advice to thicken the sauce with some cornstarch on the stove top. I baked with foil on for 45 minutes, foil off for 15, and I turned on the broiler for a few minutes to get everything browned up.

so I came upon this recipe yesterday and thought I should try it. The ingredient are so simple and taste great.

I made my sauce in a small sauce pan before pouring over my wings and added a little crushed red pepper. I also turned my wings every 15 to 20 mins to get a nice coat on both sides

This was basically a teriyaki chicken. I was expecting a much different flavor, so i was dissapointed.  I wish the title or description would have specified this. 
As for the recipe itself , the flavor was well=infused into the chicken. However, the sauce didnt really carmelize perhaps bc i used skinless tenders instead. I would stick with chicken with skin if you really want that caramelization. Theere was a ton of sauce leftover in the pan so you could make rice and pour it over it. IT WILL END UP TASTING LLIKE A CLASSIC TERIYAKI RICE BOWL. 
Bottom line: I liked it, but didnt love it. But, if you are looking for a teriyaki recipe this  will work great for you.

Loveed it!! it was so amazingly simple!!a few changes that i made were * to bake it for 30 mins *grill for 15 mins.* After baking for 30 mins  i poured the marinade into a pan and reduced it till thick , while the wings were on grill in oven, and finally poured the thick marinade on top of wings. Everyone loved it :) this one is going into my recipe dairy for sure!!

I made these the other night, followed the suggestions of others by adding 3 tbls of flour (i didn't have cornstarch) boiled the sauce before pouring it on the chicken, seasoned the chicken with seasoning salt and garlic power, baked at 375 covered for 45 mins and uncovered for the last 15...the were amazingly good! I would suggest putting them under the broiler for a couple minutes though just to set the sauce better. Also, I only used 1.5 pounds of chicken wings so this definitely would not be enough sauce for 3 pounds of wings.

Roasted chicken with a good sauce.  I made this with split bone-in chicken breast rather than wings.  It had good flavor and the broth got nice and sticky - since the marinade was cooked, I served it over noodles.

This was absolutely delicious and easy.  I made exactly as posted, but basted every 10 minutes and baked an extra 10 minutes (I used drumsticks).  The taste was outstanding, but the sauce was watery. We didn't mind, it was perfect as it was.  To get the sticky sauce next time, I will try as others suggested and cook the sauce on top of the stove with corn starch added, before pouring on the chicken.

Oh so good...I used this as a stir fry, I cubed my chicken and cooked in skillet just 1 tbsp olive oil i used cooking spray after that to decrease fat. The sauce I prepared in a pot on stovetop, I doubled recipe cuz my hubby likes saucy stuff! Let it come to a boil then on low stirring with a wisk. Some say this just wont thicken so I tried the cornstarch..some help, I actually sifted in a small amt of flour and that made it perfect. I poured the sauce over chick in skillet to simmer then cut green/red peppers and onions and added at the end. Served over rice, this sauce is so good and versatile, prepare it stovetop and possibilities are endless..thanks for this recipe!

This was really good.  I used thighs because that is what I had.  Next time I will reduce the heat a bit (may be my oven) because they slightly passed caramelized to burned. Served them with spicy sesame noodles for Chinese New Year.

This was fantastic.  I had no problems with it carmelizing like others had.  I put the chicken wings in the oven first with salt, pepper, and garlic powder for 30 minutes.  While that was cooking, I put the sauce together on the stove.  The adjustments I made were minimal and based on what I read from the reviews:  Two tablespoons of cornstarch and water, one teaspoon of red chili flakes, and a few drops of siracha.  I really wanted that sweet/spicy flavor.  Once it was thickened, I poured it on top of the chicken and let it bake for another 15 minutes.  Voila!  It was a hit and I will be making it again!

This is SOOOO good!  I saw someone suggested to make the sauce on the stove-top with some cornstarch to thicken it a bit before pouring it over the chicken.  I am going to try that next time because the sauce didn't really stick to the chicken - but the taste is AMAZING!  The chicken had a wonderful taste, and the sauce was wonderful on its own (to use for dipping as well as for the chicken).  Thank you!

Easy recipe - turned out not too bad.  I cut the soy and honey in half and used the sauce on a 4.5# packet of chicken wings - it was plenty.

Did not care for it.  The flavor, once cooked on the chicken was bland.  Plus too much liquid.  I thought it would thicken up some.  But it did not.

Pretty good recipe! I used boneless skinless breasts and added some fresh minced ginger root and just a drop of liquid smoke. Great sauce for bbq-ing too!

I prepared this with chicken thies since we prefer those to wings.  I followed the suggestion of the reviewer who dipped her chicken into cornstarch and fried first then baked.  My sauce looked like the pictures.  I increased the ketchup and honey as suggested to 3/4 cup each.  I don't think you can mess this sauce up even tweaking it to your own taste.  It was amazing.  Husband loved the new tastes and wants to have this again.  It's a keeper for me.  Thanks Sandy.

I cut up a fryer chicken and used that.  It wasn't bad but the soy sauce was overpowering.  The sauce does get nice and thick but the flavor is a little off.

This was just okay..sort of too salty sweet and I agree with some of the other readers, didn't really caramelize. I don't like wings..not enough meat so I used chicken thighs. Don't know if that made a difference..

Awesome recipe! I followed as written, only adding a 1/4 tsp. of crushed red pepper flakes - so easy and so fabulous! I served with rice and green salad for a great dinner.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!!!

Delicious recipe!!! Kids loved it. My son said that it was the best chicken I have ever cooked. I used chicken quarters (8) and I basted around every ten minutes. Baked for the majority of the time. Uncovered for the last 10-15 minutes. I will use this recipe over and over!!

When I first saw this recipe it looked sooo good - however my dish did not turn out so well. I used chicken thighs instead of wings but the sauce was not like I had hoped. I am not sure what I did wrong, so one day I will give it another shot.

I still served it for dinner and my kids ate it - but my son covered it in BBQ sauce.......LOL

Fantastic! I received rave reviews and will definitely make again! I did make some slight adjustments...added some cornstarch (2 tablespoons), extra garlic, and boiled the sauce on the stove for 15 min. Covered and baked 45 minutes at 375. Removed from the oven and flipped each wing. Upped the oven to 400, uncovered and baked for 25 min.

It was very good. It is not necessary to simmer and thicken the sauce first, but it does give a better end result.

I used boneless chicken breasts and only had to bake the chicken for 20 minutes so the sauce never caramelized on the chicken.  I did broil it for a couple of minutes at the end.  The chicken was delicious nevertheless.  Next time I will cook the sauce to thicken before pouring it over the chicken.  Great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good simple recipe. I adjusted for 2 people. The ketchup gives it a tangy sweet taste. Recipe is good for any chicken part. I use it on thighs and drumettes. A regular in my household from now on :)

My husband loved this recipe. I modified it of course like the comments suggested to make it thicker. I boiled it on the stove top then poured it on. I added more hot sauce also (Frank's Red Hot). The next time I make it I am using wing sauce instead, it's thicker. They did not come out that spicy, but they are really sweet. If you don't like sweet stuff, just use less honey. I did not change too much though from the orginal recipe. Letting the sauce stand and thicken before serving should help.

We have enjoyed this baked, however on the BBQ is even better!  Grill chicken for 5 minutes on each side (low). Place ckn in foil pan, add sauce. Cook on low heat for 20 minutes. YUM!

This glaze had no flavour at all.  I have no idea why that happened but the chicken was so bland I am loathe to try it again.  I'll try something different next time.

I used chicken breasts (3pounds) and also cooked the sauce on the stovetop to thicken before baking.  It seemed like a lot of sauce and was still drippy.  I noticed it was not thick enough after cooking so I put the sauce back into the pot and thickened with a rue of flour.  Then, that thickened the sauce deliciously!

My family loved this so much they were fighting over the leftovers!  I did make a few changes...I used half honey and half suryp; 3 tablespoons of corn starch muxed with alittle water; baked the chicken for 30 mins. before adding the glaze; and microwaved the glaze for 2 mins. before adding the cornstarch and microwaved once more for 1 min.

I made about 1/3 of this recipe using about 1 lb. of wing pieces.  Even though I also scaled the sauce, a lot of it got left behind in the baking dish.  So next time I'll cut that back and I think I’ll still have plenty to glaze the wings.  The flavor was very good, but mine didn’t really “crisp” as much as I’d like – maybe too much sauce?  I lined my baking dish with non-stick foil and clean-up was a snap!  I’ll make these again with a few alterations.  Good recipe!

This was very GOOD! I used a whole chicken and baked it in an oven bag first at 350 degrees.  I then split the bag open and poured the sauce and based it until it was caramelized.  Tender and juicy!

Not bad. I cooked the sauce (1/2 cup ketchup, heaping tbsp very sweet honey, 1/4 cup soy sauce, 3-4 cloves garlic, 1 tsp spicy hot sauce, 2 dashes cayenne, 1 dash cumin, black pepper) in a pot for 5 minutes, but I should have done it longer. Then placed 3 chicken breasts in a Pyrex, poured sauce on top, cooked in oven for 40 minutes at 350. Be careful to get all the sauce on top of the chicken. Don't waste it in the bottom of the pan.

Another great teriyaki-like recipe but the title didn't promise the "carmelized" part. I still gave it a 5 because when baking with the sauce, it acts like a marinating stage that gave the chicken some flavor. 5-10 minutes before being done, I scooped out some sauce and whisked it with cornstarch then transferred all the sauce and chicken (I used drummettes & wings btw) in large pan and simmered until thickened. I hate the extra step but it's worth it. It's way easier to clean aslo due to using honey than those teriyaki sauces that uses sugar. Update: Second time around, I did not transfer the chicken in a pan but I did scooped out some of the sauce and whisked with cornstarch then poured it back to the baking dish. Well, this will be my go-to teriyaki dish.

Great testing recipe but the sauce does not caramelize like the title suggests.  But if you don't care about that then you can't go wrong with the flavor.

Great tasting sauce.  I did add 1T of cornstarch to the soy sauce and heated it on the stove until thickened, then removed from the heat and added the honey.  *hint-it's better if you don't boil honey, as this can change the flavor.*  Poured about 2/3 of the sauce over the wings and baked 45 minutes, then topped with the remaining sauce and baked the final 15 minutes.  Wings were tender, juicy, and lightly caramelized.  Next time, I may try with a slightly higher oven temp to see if they will brown a little more.

Tasty, the chicken was moist but the sauce was a bit runny so the chicken just sat in it, rather that on it.  Next time I may try the suggestion by some to precook the sauce in an effort to make it thicker so it will stick to the chicken better.  I definately think the recipie is worth trying again.  I used a bone in chicken breast and it was great.

This is a really good sauce, but putting it on at the beginning and the juice from the chicken causes the sauce not to carmelize.  Next time I will cook the chicken for about a half hour then add the sauce, pouring off the liquid from the chicken first.

The flavor was good, but it didn't caramelize because of the fat/juice of the chicken when cooking.  It ended up a very thin sauce.    I like the idea of cooking the sauce on the stove first, then adding it when baking.  Will try that next time.

I thought this was great! I used agave nectar instead of honey because that was all I had in the house and i also thickened half the marinade with cornstarch and served it on the side. Got rave reviews over this! THank you!

It was delicious... however it definately had to cook longer then an hour to make it caramelized... and I did take off the lid for 15 minutes and then when one side had the nice coating I flipped them. I would say it took at least 1 hour and 1/2.

Heres how to get a nice crunch! Dry the pieces off, then put them in a bag of flour and shake off any excess flour. Put them on a broiler pan and bake @385. At the halfway point, turn them. When they are finished, toss the wings into the mixture and return them to the pan for about 15 minutes. The will be perfect and crunchy!

I have used this sauce twice, once on wings and once on cut up boneless breasts, took other posters advice and cooked the sauce ontop of the stove first then poured over chicken to bake, and it turned out GREAT both times - prefer the breasts served over steamed rice (less messy to eat)

Did it with boneless skinless chicken breast and it was good. I did more sauce and cooked it on the stove top first and then poured on chicken.

This was good. Used the advice of one reviewer for putting over boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of wings etc. My mother really liked it. I thought it was good -- not fabulous -- but good. I will keep it in my recipe box for a night when I'm wondering what to do with chicken and have exhausted my stand-by recipes.

Yummy! Everyone gobbled it all up! I used the chicken I had in the freezer - 3 breast halves and 8 chicken legs (not wings) but it turned out fabulous! Served with brown rice and green beans... there wasn't even enough - everyone wanted some for leftovers!

I have to admit I basically used this as a suggestion. I made the sauce in a bowl, cubed up chicken breasts, sauteed them in a pan, dumped the sauce over and cooked the chicken through. I was just looking for something quick and easy that I knew my kid would eat - but this was GOOD. I added lemon juice at the end, just cuz I had one, and the tanginess cut the sweet - it was perfect! My son ate a ton. I poured the chicken and lots of sauce over rice. I made 2 breasts but a full helping of sauce for the rice. Good job!

This is fantastic!  I followed the ingredients exactly except that I didn't add any salt (there is already a whole lot of soy sauce) and I sprinkled in some red pepper flakes.  I boiled the sauce along with some corn starch, then simmered it for about 10 minutes.  I poured the sauce over the chicken (I used 3.5 lbs boneless skinless breasts) and baked it for about 40 minutes, taking it out about every 10 minutes to flip and baste it.  I had also pierced the chicken several times so the flavor would soak through a little bit.  The sauce didn't caramelize - in fact it stayed a little thin even with the corn starch - but the flavor was so delicious it didn't matter what consistency it was.  My husband and I both loved it.  I will definitely make this again.

Unbelievable!  Finger lickin good!  I took advice of other reviewers and added corn starch to the sauce.  The best wings I have ever had.  We served them for a super bowl party and they were gone in seconds!

OMG this was amazing. Hubby said this is the best chicken I ever made. I read the reviews before hand and made the sauce on the stove top to thicken, I did not add any corn starch because I don't have any but I left it to boil long enough to thicken. I love the asian taste to this more like sweet and sour chicken, daughter also loved it. Will definitely put this one in my book.

I loved this recipe and will make it many more times....I used boneless skinless chicken breasts (2 breasts) and cooked for about 35 mins at 375 degrees and the last 30 minutes at 400 degrees, turning the chicken every 15 minutes or so.  Also the sauce didn't really thicken up for me too much so once the chicken was cooked I just poured the sauce into a small saucepan and added a little cornstarch and water and brought the sauce to a boil and stirred until I got the consistency that I wanted....the sauce was so good that I saved the leftover sauce and froze it till the next time I want a plain bland chicken breast..!!! Great recipe!!!

Very Good!  The only things I changed are; I added about 1/4 cup chili sauce and used chicken thighs and breasts (personal preference).  My husband and I both thought it was awsome, in fact I took leftovers to work to share with a friend and had to make a copy of the recipe for her also.

Easy and delicious!  My picky kids and the neighbor kids, as well as DH and I, loved it.  I doubled the sauce and kept half back to use at a later date.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts cut into large nugget-sized pieces.  I also eliminated the salt; figured the soy sauce and castsup have more than enough.  Simmered the sauce on the stove for about 15 minutes then baked in the oven at 450 for 20 minutes.  The chicken came out perfect but the sauce was still very runny.  We served it over rice.  Everyone loved it, but it would be even more awesome sticky.  I suggest simmering till sauce reaches a honey-like consistency.  Allow at least half an hour for that.  Will definitely make often.  Thank you!

I have already made this twice.  I took one of the reviewers ideas of first simmering all the ingredients before pouring it on the chicken.  I also season my chicken first and it was AWESOME.  My kids loved it and even when it is reheated, it remains moist.  Please read the reviews because there are some helpful hints you don't want to miss like adding cornstarch to thicken as during cooking the sauce can become thin.  This is one of my top recipes so far this year!  Thanks Sandy!

Great chicken!  I made it with boneless/skinless chicken tenders so I made only minor adjustments to the ingredient proportions and I added a little bit of hot sauce to give it a zip.  But overall it was fantastic.  I need to figure out the right combination of ingredients to get the chicken just right.  Honestly, I cooked it a bit too long trying to get the chicken to caramelize.  DH suggested I just take most of the sauce out for the last 10 minutes.  Not sure if that will work, but will be trying it next time.  It isn't often that both DH and I like a recipe enough that we are willing to try it again immediately (I think we'll be trying this out again during the weekend!) Thanks for a great recipe!  I can't wait to try it just as it is written for chicken wings!

I was looking for something different to make with leftover chicken and was so happy to find this on the home page. i just threw the ingredients (minus chicken) into a saucepan, boiled it up and then heated strips of leftover chicken it the sauce. I finished it off with some fresh peas and served it over plain rice. Yummy!

5 stars!  I used skinned turkey thighs, about 2/3 lbs. each.  We're on a sodium restricted diet so I used 1/2 c. low sodium soy sauce and 1/4 cup Bellino Balsamic Vinegar table and basting sauce which has zero sodium.  I will cut back on the honey next time.  The glaze made a delicious gravy to pour on the brown rice I made to serve with the turkey.  I also basted the thighs about 4 times during baking them for a little over an hour; they were very tender and tasty.

Very very easy recipe. Certainly a big hit with my family.   If you want to get the deep color try basting it before its done and then again when you take it out while its still hot.   If you dont have enough honey you can substitute brown sugar.   1 cup of honey = 1 & 1/4 cup of brown sugar.

This was so great!  I have a very hard time getting my six grandchildren to eat chicken other than fried, but they absolutely loved this.  I will have to double the recipe next time - all the kids wanted thirds.  The only thing I would do differently is to cook the glaze down before I pour it onto the chicken to bake.

awesome ! It tastes just as the one I eat in Miami so now I won't have to cross the ocean. To cook it more cajun style I put cashew nut in the sauce and served it with boiled rice and fried bananas. we all loved it !!! who said American food is not good ?????

Made this according to Meredith's review except I substituted corn syrup for most of the honey. Poured it over drumsticks that I baked for 50 minutes and served the sauce over rice. My husband and I both liked it.

Wow. I don't even know what to say. This is some of the best sauce I have ever tasted. I used meredith's suggestions for the stove top method & it was perfect. This sauce would be awesome on ribs as well.

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and it was great!  I added about 4 cloves of garlic which helped pump up the flavor.  My sauce didn't really turn out sticky, even though I boiled it on the store first, but it was still good.  I served the extra sauce over basmati rice and it was awesome. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed Meredith's instruction below to try to get the sauce thicker. While it was thick in the saucepan, once I cooked it with the chicken, it was less thick. I wanted these to be rib sticking thick! Even though they weren't, the sauce is still good!

Great chicken recipe!  Sweet and tangy!  I used chicken breasts rather than wings and it turned out delicious!  I served this dish with colorful fried rice.  Nice combination!

We really enjoyed this dish, specially the kids. I made with skinless bone in chicken breast instead of wings. I reduced the amount of honey to 3/4 cup, 1/3 cup of lite soy sauce to cut on sodium and doubled the amount of ketchup. Also, as suggested, I boiled the sauce first, then poured over the chicken, baked covered for 30 minutes and uncovered for 20 minutes.

Loved this. I followed one reviewer's advice and used 3/4 c. honey - 3/4 c. ketchup - 1/2 c. soy, boiling the sauce to reduce first.  I made wings, and I baked at 350F for 1 hour, turning them once and spooning the sauce over.  I saved a few for the next day, and they were even better!

I am SOO excited - I'm in shock by how much my dad enjoyed this!!! He's always easy to please but he went on and on and on about how amazing this was!  Here's what I did: mixed 3/4 cup ketchup, 3/4 cup honey, 1/2 cup soy sauce, and some minced garlic; cooked the mixture on the stove top until boiling and reduced heat. Put carrots and 3 bone in skinless chicken breasts in my crock pot, poured the sauce over top, let cook on high for 1 hr, then on low for another 3.5-4 hrs, then on high for the last hour and added broccoli and cauliflower during the last hour. Served with chicken fried rice!

I modified this a bit... 1/4 C soy sauce 1/2 C ketchup 1/2 C honey 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes  This is one of our favorite meals. We pour the sauce over boneless or bone in chicken and bake. I reccomend making mashed potatoes and broccoli with this chicken because the sauce can be drizzled over both it is so good! We look forward to this meal every time I make it.

This is FREAKING AWESOME. The flavor was perfect and I actually scaled this down to one serving for some left over wings. After devouring my last wing, I was wishing I had more to nibble on. My modifications to the recipe include the following: 1)My wings were lightly preseasoned with S&P. 2)I added brown mustard and chinese spicy mustard to the mixture. 3) I then added a little curry and pepper to the chicken and then mix the sauce. I placed the chicken in the over and cook to done. Then I broiled and flipped continuously. I had no problem with the chicken caramelizing without heating the sauce first. Next, time I may let it broil just a tad longer to cook the skin.   The taste of this recipe is amazing. I was able to take advantage of low sodium soy sauce, no sugar added ketchup, and avoid a lot of junk served in processed/fast food restaurants. This is an all-star recipe to add to my building arsenal

This is one of my new favorite recipes!  I have made this more than five times in the past two months and was a huge hit at family gatherings.  I used party wings instead, baked them for about 35 minutes or so, until they were caramelized.  Great flavor and the chicken remains extremely moist.  This also makes perfect leftovers!

I don't know how this recipe gets so many good reviews. I made it and it was nothing special, the result is pieces of chicken swimming in brown liquid (and I did cook the sauce on stovetop first before baking the dish). Thinking of maybe most of the liquid is fat, I lost my appetite. My 4 year old ate this though, that's why this gets 2 stars from me.

very good. i took bits and pieces of advice from several viewers: 1.) boiled sauce over stove top + cornstarch 2.) used more garlic and ketchup, added red pepper flakes 3.) baked covered @ 375 for 20 min. in 9 x 11 pan 4.) baked uncovered for 20 more min. 5.) broiled 5 min on each side for last 10 min in broiler pan. 6.) also flipped and basted wings about 3-4 times. it had a really good glaze and nice color :)

I couldn't go 1 cup of honey--too sweet just thinking about it!  I used 3/4 cup honey, 1/4 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup lower salt soy sauce and 1 heaping T. minced garlic.  I brushed the sauce on skinless, boneless chicken breasts.  I baked them in the oven and finished them on the grill.  I added 1 T. cornstarch and 2 T. cold water to the remaining sauce and cooked it in the microwave 2 minutes.  Yummmy!  I wish I had chicken wings rather than chicken breasts.  Next time, definitely chicken wings!

This chicken was delicious. I scaled down the recipe to 2 servings and used 4 chicken legs. I followed the original recipe exactly and cooked for 1 hour, flipping over and basting the chicken every 15 minutes. I put it under the broiler the last few minutes. It caramelized beautifully on the chicken and we ended up with a nice thick sticky glaze. Served it over brown rice which soaked up the rest of the sauce nicely. Please take a look at the photo!

Very good! I cut down the amount of ketchup and honey but added a bit of curry powder.

WOW!!!  This was awesome.  I used chicken breasts, and cooked the sauce in a saucepan for about 20 minutes before baking 1 hour with the chicken in the oven.  So, the sauce was cooked for about 1 hour and 20 minutes. I'll be making this chicken again for sure!

Outstanding!  Made double batch for Super Bowl. Had leftovers today for lunch. One thing, I used two different pans, one glass and one store bought aluminum.  The wings in the glass pan carmelized much better than the aluminum.  Enjoy!

I made this recipe using boneless/skinless chicken breasts. I made the sauce as written, but heated it on the stove with a TBS of cornstarch mixed in for thickening. I browned my chicken breasts first and cooked them at 350 in the oven for 40 minutes, turning once. Everyone liked the sauce on the chicken, but I think next time I will cover the chicken and perhaps reduce cooking time to 30 minutes. The chicken was a bit dry, but dipping it in the sauce took care of that. Overall, this is a great recipe, easy to assemble ingredients, quick prep, and makes a great dinner. Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was very good. I did like another reviewer suggested and used molasses for half the honey. I also added cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it some before pouring over the chicken. It was a hit w/my family and I would definitely make this again.

Wonderful! I made some adjustments also. 1/2 cup of ketchup, 1/2 soy sauce, 1/4 teaspoon of ginger, 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, about 1/2 cup of honey, 1 tablespoon of brown suger, 3 to 4 teaspoon of white suger, 1 teaspoon of lea and perrinsworchestershire sauce,  tablespoon of garlic powder(may neet to add more) and 1 teaspoon of texas pete hot sauce.  I cook that on the stove for about 5 minutes and poured over the chicken during the last 15 to minutes of oooking.  I seasoned the chicken(legs and thighs) with pepper, accent, chili powder, and paprika. I let that back for about 30 mintues.  Two rules to good cooking always taste as you go along specailly with sauces so you can make adjustments and always use tongs!

What a delicious glaze. The only thing I changed was that I used turkey wings (huge, I know) and substituted brown sugar for the honey. Delicious!  First time making wings too. Thank you!

This was a pretty good recipe although it didn't come close to caramelizing, it was just runny (and I did boil the sauce on the stove top even adding corn starch to thicken and broiled it while in the oven).  It was just a very runny sauce so I was disappointed - I was hoping for a thicker coating.  The taste however was good, the chicken was moist and flavourful.  I am not sure whether I'd make again, I think I might try the candied garlic chicken wings to see if I can find a thicker sauce.  All in all good recipe but I don't think caramelize is good for the title ... ?  Maybe try some of the other reviewers suggestions.

Made with boneless skinless chicken breasts and simmered sauce before pouring on top of chicken and just popped in the oven. Whole family loved it! Not too sweet, not too salty, just right.

Great recipe!  Never fails to please anyone. I noticed if you use good quality honey, it caramelizes better; seems like store bought honey is runnier.

I have to admit I did not follow this recipe as written. I did make the sauce with all of the ingredients listed but I cut up boneless, skinless chicken breasts into chunks and simmered it all together on the stovetop for about 20 minutes. The sauce did thicken some and I served it over rice. It had a really great flavor and my hubby and I both enjoyed the dish. This recipe is very simple and big on taste. I will definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good.  Like others, the sauce never carmelized.  But I did turn up the heat in the oven towards the end of baking and it seemed to carmelize on the chicken only.  I was a bit dissapointed that the flavor didn't really go beyond the skin of the chicken wings.  I had made quite a bit of them so when I reheated them in the oven I added some crushed red pepper to it and it was even better.  Sweet/spicy at the same time.

Easy to make and usable for any type of chicken part, not just wings.  Also, very kid-friendly.  Great to make during the week!

This chicken was very good. I followed the directions except I chopped an onion with the garlic and added it to the sauce. The sauce wouldn't carmelize so I put the entire casserole into the broiler for the last 3 or 4 minutes. That really helped!! I served the sauce & chicken over buttered rice.

I give this 4 1/2 stars.  Everyone absolutely loved the flavor of the sauce but like many of the other reviewers, I was unable to get it to thicken.  The chicken reached the right temperature in an hour, so maybe next time, I will try adding corn starch as one reviewer suggested.  This sauce would be good on so many other meats!

Really good.  I used drumsticks.  Iput 4 garlic cloves, 1/3 c soy sauce, and 3 TBLS ketchup.  Half way thru cooking, I removed some of the sauce, added a TBLS of cornstarch to it,wisked it all together, and poured it over the chicken.  A new family favorite.

This was great! We used Legs & Thighs, and as some suggested cooked the glaze prior to pouring on the chicken. This will be a keeper. It made a lot of glaze and I was worried it wouldnt caramelize - after 30 mins of cooking I removed about 1/2 cup of the glaze with a turkey baster. It turned out perfectly! Thanks for the recipe!

LOVED THIS ONE! I have already made it twice. This first time with the wings as per recipe and the second time was with skinless chicken breasts. I definitely like the wings better because the skin was still on (although my husband and I don't eat the skin, but it definitely adds flavor) Thanks for the recipe!

This had a very good flavor, I used chicken wings and wished I had used breasts.  I covered the pan when i put it in the oven and I think maybe I should not have done that, b/c the sauce never caramelized, I had to add cornstarch to it.  I took the cover off after about 30 mins thinking that this was why the sauce was not getting thick, but it still didn't help much.  SO, the mistake could have completely been my fault. However, the flavor was great!  Can't wait to try it on breasts..thanks for the recipe.

V. good!! I baked it with 2 chicken breasts, sliced in half, in a shallow casserole dish for 35 mins., rotating once during cooking. I also used a pinch of garlic powder instead of a clove - so easy to make/clean up - it will go on my regular rotation!!

I gave it a five because some, like myself, only look at those. Didn't want to compromize a near-perfect recipe. I used a cut-up chicken and marinated it overnight, then baked it. It was wonderful. left a Li..ttle to be desired, but couldn't tell you what. Good the next day as well. Try it, you'll like it.Did cut soy sauce to 1/4 cup and 1/2 cup honey and 2 Tbsp. brown sugar. Not even TOO sweet. ((:)>

This came out really good. My husband wanted me to make another batch the same night. I made a few changes: cut soy sauce to 1/3 cup, cut honey in half, added 2 tablespoons brown sugar, 2 cloves of garlic, and a splash of lemon juice. Will definitely make again (especially if husband has anything to say about it)

I was trying to find something cheap, easy, and tasty all at the same time, and I found it!  My husband LOVES this stuff.  We just had it last night, and he's wanting me to make it again tonight.  I didn't have any honey, so I had to use one cup of sugar instead.  I may cut back on the soy sauce this time, though.  It was really good, but just a tad bit on the salty side.

I made these last night for dinner with some drumsticks I had in the fridge.  The only change I made to the recipe was to add about 2 tbs of cider vinegar.  While the sauce did not carmalize, it still coated the chicken nicely.  During the last 10 minutes, I upped the temperature to 550, and then the chicken got gooey and brown.  We really enjoyed this recipe, but it was still a bit sweet for our taste.  Maybe next time I'll add a little hot sauce too.  I definately have no complaints with the ease of it- I'm sure I'll be making it again.

This recipe gets four stars because it is a good recipe on its own, but better as a starting point for making delicious wings and other pieces of chicken.  I de-skin drumsticks, breasts, thighs, you name it for this recipe.  For superbowl, I trimmed the fat from dozens of boneless thighs, cut them into smaller pieces and prepared them using this as a base recipe. They were a huge hit.  I marinated them overnight in some soy/ketchup them made lots of sauce the next morning for the actual baking.  I also include at least a few drops of some hot sauce...even if you don't like spicy at all, this adds a kick of flavor.  I think this recipe should include a step for basting and turning, which I have found, by trial and error, to be essential.  The upshot:  Turn and baste once in the middle of baking, then again when they are almost done.  If needed for extra sticking power, turn the broiler on for a few minutes after basting just before you are ready to take them out of the oven. Get lots of napkins and enjoy.

I have made this recipe several times, each time changing it a bit.  I made it per instructions this time and it was great - a definate keeper.  Nothing extraordinary, but it was so easy to make and the flavor was great - did not carmelize, (probably a good thing) but the sauce definately coated and cooked into the chicken.  I used wing pieces.  I also cooked it a bit longer.  If you want it to carmelize, try cutting down the liquid since the chicken makes so much.

This has good flavor - but I used the quick methods others used because too many people said it won't carmelize after spending so much time cooking.  I ended up using chicken breasts, substituting dark soy sauce and adding extra garlic, red pepper flakes and ginger - then marinated chicken for 2 hrs. I put it in foil lined pan - then I boiled that marinate -like others - adding some corn starch/water mixture.  Poured that over the chicken (reserving some to pour over rice) - cooked it at 400 degrees for 10 min. each side. Everyone enjoyed it and liked the sauce on the rice - I served it with Asian style green beans.  Will make it again since it's easy and have the items on hand.

Absolutely loved the flavour of this dish! I used a whole chicken cut up and it was wonderful. I removed the chicken when it was done and let the sauce carmelize a bit more. I have been asked to make it again, already!

We used 2 whole chickens and doubled the recipe but only used half the olive oil (because the chicken juices would naturally increase the amount of fluid) and half the honey (ran out - ooops!)  My kids still loved it, and so did we.  We did have to keep an eye on it though - it woudl have had a tendency to burn as others have mentioned.

This chicken is absolutely wonderful !!! I made a few improvitions: I used boneless skinless chicken breast, and I cooked the sauce for about 10 min. on the stove top after reading the reviews. While I cooked the sauce, I seasoned the chicken and put it in the oven to cut down on cooking time. I also added a little of Mrs. Dash extra spicy seasoning to the sauce for an extra kick. But anyway, the chicken carmelized beautifully and taste great ! Thanks for this terrific recipe Sandy, will definately make again.

I prepared this recipe exactly as written and it came out great.  The wings were sticky and delicious.  My husband loved them.  The only tip I have... watch closely at the end for burning.

I didn't have any chicken wings so I used chicken tenders, this was very tasty and the extra sauce was yummy over egg noodles.  Definitely a keeper!

Yum!  Even my kids ate this one.  I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into chunks.  Served it over white rice, drizzled with a little of the sauce.  My sauce didn't "caramelize" well, but worked great with the rice.  The flavor was outstanding.  This chicken would be fabulous on the grill.  I will definitely make it again.

This was great! A little bit on the sweet side but good.  I added crushed red pepper, ground ginger, and a tblsp of Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce.  I also omitted the olive oil because I forgot.  I used drumsticks as this is what I had on hand. The cooking time was just right and the sauce caramelized perfectly.  I did turn the chicken and baste every few minutes though.  I recommend to pair with another food that will contrast to the sweetness of this dish.

This was tasty enough, and the chicken was nice and moist, but after an hour my sauce was watery and hadn't caramelized. I'll try it again sometime since my guests still gave it 'thumbs up', and maybe I'll have better luck with the sauce.

This was very good even though I forgot to add the garlic to the sauce. I will make this again...with the garlic. Make sure you don't overcook the chicken like I did. Still...VERY YUMMY!

We all loved it!  I took the advice of another review/rating and used less honey, boneless chicken breast, oven at 400, and cooked the sauce on top of stove w/a bit of cornstarch for about 10 minutes.  I also baked it covered w/alumium for one hour, uncovered for last 15 min.  It still turned out somewhat runny.  The flavor of the sauce was yummy.  I will use this recipe again but will try it w/more cornstarch.  Thanks!

I followed the advice from some of the other posters and cooked the sauce for about fifteen minutes before pouring it on to the chicken. I experienced some carmelization but not as much as I would have liked. My husband liked this recipe but my kids just thought it was BBQ. Very easy to make recipe. Try it.

No one liked this recipe in my family.  There was too much liquid to allow the chicken to get a nice glaze.  It might be better as a glaze when grilling chicken.

I made this with boneless thighs and cooked the sauce on top of the stove before adding it over the chicken and placing into the oven. It was pretty thin, so I did as others mentioned and added cornstarch to thicken. That worked. It was very tasty and I got compliments!

Great taste with very little prep! I used boneless skinless chicken, cut into pieces and added extra garlic. I turned the chicken about half way thru, and only baked for about 30 min.

this is great and really easy.  I have tried it covered and uncovered.  I prefer it covered for all except the last 15 minutes of cooking.  That lets the sauce thicken, but if you leave it uncovered the whole time the sauce seems to scorch and give it a smokey or even "burnt" taste.  Great recipe.

I made this for my boyfriend and he loved it.  The chicken caramelized beautifully after letting it stand for five minutes. The sauce was very flavorful (I did not adhere strictly to the measurements though, I taste tested the sauce and made slight adjustments.)

This was the best chicken that I've ever tasted.And it's so simple to make. You just combine the few ingredients, pour it over the chicken(I prefer legs) and pop it into the oven. It caramelizes easy, you just have to cook it longer close to the bottom element and turn it every 20 minutes like a previous review mentioned and it comes out perfect. I will use the recipe again and again. It goes great with potato or macaroni salad. Thanks for sharing Sandy. It's finger lickin' good.  :)

I have been using this recipe for over a year now, both with just wings and with legs & thighs. It is a GREAT recipe!  It has become a standard for family gatherings.  To get the chicken to caramelize, I poor off the excess liquid for the last 15 minutes of cooking.

I made this chicken for my boyfriend and to my surprise, he actually enjoyed it.  It had a pretty decent flavor, he was surprised to find out it had ketchup in it though.  My only complaint is that it wasn't sticky enough for me.  I also baked the chicken for a longer time than recommended in the recipe, in an attempt to thicken the sauce and allow it to stick to the chicken.  The extra time didn't make a difference in making the sauce stickier, though.  Other than that, I'll make this recipe again, only at my boyfriend's request, as I didn't enjoy it too much.

Excellent! My husband and I really loved it. I made rice with it and my husband loved the extra sauce drizzled on his rice.

This was a pretty good redipe in order for them to be carmelized I added a whole bunch of honey to the top once everything was in the pan and I took the last raters advise and uncovered and based and even added more honey to the top. It wasn't a great carmelized topping but none the less the wings were great thanks...

Mine didn't caramelize either but it tasted great!
I left out the oil because I thought the chicken created enough.  My boyfriend and my family loved it: tastes just like teriyaki chicken.

We didn't like this.  Way too much honey - gave it a overly sweet taste.  We aren't picky - but this didn't go over well at all.

Yummy and sticky.  I made it with white rice, so I poured the gooey mixture left in the pan over the rice.  (Like most other people, mine didn't carmelize either).
Probably make it again.  My husband seemed to like it.

I've made this twice now with the same, disappointing results. The sauce never caramelized (just turned into a light-colored runny mess) & it was quite bland. I have too many other GOOD baked wing recipes to ever make this again. Too bad, because it sounded like it would be really good.

I made these for a super bowl party and it turned out great. I actually used 10 lbs of wings so I added 4 times the ingredients. They were a huge hit! I will definitely make these again.

I've been making teriyaki chicken for years being I'm of Japanese ancestry.  This was the best I've made.  The only change from how I usually make my sauce is using honey instead of sugar.  I'll be making it this way again.

I made this in a 9x13 glass dish and although it was tasty I do not recommend using glass ovenware for this recipe... the sauce burned to such a crisp that I had to soak pan for 2 days to clean it off! If I make again will line pan with foil.

I suspected that the chicken turned out like wood.  The sauce is OK, but the method ruins the chicken.  It would be much better if the chicken was baked first and the sauce added later and placed under the broiler to caramelize.

I made this but had to add my twist.  I used about 1/4 Cup of the honey and the rest coke.  I also added red pepper flakes, cracked black pepper.  I cooked the sauce on the stove.  
I poured the sauce over fried chicken thighs and finished them off in the oven.  There are 0 left!   The sauce is very, very good.

These were delicious and super easy to make! The only thing I did differently was that I used chili sauce instead of ketchup. I followed another user's tip and cooked the sauce to thicken it up. Excellent. I think next time I will add some hot sauce and other spices to kick up the heat. I definitely recommend this! I saved the extra sauce to use for dinner tonight on pork chops! Yum!

This was delicious the meat was so tender but I made a few adjustments.  I cut off the wing tips and used 1/2 the soy then added 2 tablespoons honey bbq sauce.  After mixing ingredients in bowl I put all but 1/4 cup in a pot.  The 1/4 cup I added about 2 tablespoons cornstarch to that and whisked when no more lumps and it to the pot, heat untill bubbly and thick then add over wings.  They were really wonderful thank you!

I have prepared this twice.  It does not caramelize as written.  You must cook the sauce on the stove first. I use boneless, skinless thighs. Make sure you cook the sauce first or you will be disappointed.

Had a difficult time deciding on a rating for this dish.  The flavor was delicious but, I found the sauce to be runny and not thickened.  I knew that the chicken would burn if I didn't cover it so I started it out skin side down, covered with foil.  At 30 minutes, I turned the chicken pieces over.  At 45 minutes, I uncovered it.  At the end, I basted everything with the watery sauce because the pieces looked dry on top.  The skin did not get crispy (probably because it was covered).  But, the flavor was very good and the chicken was moist.  It would make delicious chicken wings if I could figure out how to get thickened sauce without burnt chicken. Update: Have tried again. I recalled from making ribs that when you want something to caramelize, you need to use a shallow pan.  So, I made the wings in a jelly roll pan covered with foil.  Once again, the taste was good, but the sauce still did not fully caramelize.  It did get thicker than last time.  Won't make again as there are other easier, better recipes for sticky wings.

Made this with bone in chicken breasts tonight. Followed the directions exactly except I didn't have ketchup so I used chili sauce.  My husband called it "Tasty". It was flavorful and the taste not too overpowering. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I would prefer the sauce be thicker (it was fairly watery.)  I will make this again and maybe cook the sauce down on the stove first. Thanks!

So easy to prep and cook! I took crankerchick's tip and boiled up the "syrup" with  2TBSP corn starch. Makes a bit more syrup liquid than ideal, so after the hour I drained most off and cooked for another 10 minutes to get more caramelization. Tastes SO good....definitely a hit for my first time trying to cook wings!

I used skinless boneless breast and followed the 3/4 ketchup, 3/4 honey, 1/2 soy sauce etc and boiled for 10 minutes...did not turn out thick and sticky...it was watery, but it was flavorful and went well over the Jasmine rice. IN ADDITION: There was still a lot of left over sauce that I kept in the fridge (I only cooked half the amt of chicken recipe called for)...used some of it as a marinade for pork loin steaks and they turned out delicious!

This was excellent. Hubby and I loved it. The only difference I had was I marinated chicken first, and covered pieces of chicken breast (chunks) In corn starch then deep fried. When all pieces were done I put chicken and broccoli into a pan and covered everything with thickened sauce before sticking it in over for 15-20 mins at 350. Perfect Chinese recipe !

We loved these!  The only thing we did different was to add red pepper flakes to the sauce, seasoned the wings with seasoned salt, pepper, and garlic powder. We thickened the sauce slightly. We basted them while baking and placed under broiler for a few moments prior to serving. Yummy!!

This came out perfect! I did add the 2 tbl of corn starch and about 2 tbl of sriracha for a little kick. Baked at 40 minutes covered at 375F, turn the chicken over, and then 20 minutes uncovered for beautiful skin, juicy meat, and delicious flavor! 

A keeper for sure :)

I always look for easy simple fast recipes to make.  This was very simple and fast to make.  Plus they came out great.  My kids (4 and 6 year old) and husband loved them too.  I  used the same recipe as stated but I forgot to buy the fresh garlic.  Luckily I had garlic powder and it still came out good.

It was cool. It seemed like the sauce couldn't decide if it was supposed to be sweet (thinking BBQ sauce) or if it was supposed to be tangy/bitter. I would make this again, but it would probably be easier to just use a bottled marinade.

Followed the recipe word for word. Used 2.5 lb of chicken wings instead of 3 and flipped the chicken and recovered it in sauce every 10-15 minutes and it came out amazing ! Boyfriend said all he wanted for his birthday would be more of these wings ??

I've made this several times for dinner parties and it came out great each time. I usually use chicken thighs and marinate them for a couple hours, saving the rest of the sauce for basting while in the oven. also made this dish with the addition of orange marmalade and apricot jam a few times. Delish!

Made it close to the recipe as far as ingredients (added a bit more catsup).  cooked it down in a sauce pan first.  Baked with boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  Texture and glazing were very good but we didn't care for the flavor.  Don't know what was off, we just didn't care for it.

Both my husband and myself thought this was pretty boring.  It tasted like a simple BBQ sauce without the smoke and heat.  It was edible and tasted okay, but it wasn't something I would rave about.

I am not a bbq sauce fan, but my husband is.  He loved this recipe!  For me, it seemed to lack a certain something.  I think next time I make it, I will substitute 1/2 the honey for orange marmalade.  I am thinking that is the certain something it lacked for me.

The only think negative I can say is that I wish the sauce flavor seeped into the chicken more.  I did use chicken thighs.  This would be great grilled as well..

I did not care for this, though hubby thought it was ok.  Luckily I didn't add salt, because even using low sodium soy sauce, it was much too salty for me.  It did caramelize nicely though!

AWESOME! First, I made the chicken exactly as directed THEN I read a few reviews. The chicken was in the oven cooking away (about 15 minutes) when I took it out, drained the juices into a small pot, and put the chicken back in the oven all alone. Into the marinade, I stirred the corn starch (mixed with a little water) to thicken it. My hubby likes spice more than me but I added a teaspoon of hot sauce just cause I love him. THEN, I pulled out the chicken, spooned on the thickened sauce and put it back into the oven for
another 15 minutes to make sure it was fully cooked. SOOOO GOOD! Ate more than I should have. *smile*

This was okay.  May have been better if I had used wings, but only had boneless skinless chicken breast.

This was great!  It was borderline over-salty though.  I didn't have low sodium soy sauce, so that would probably do it.  I adjusted the sauce like a lot of reviewers did by adding more ketchup and less honey.  Cornstarch would've been helpful too.
I highly recommend adding a chopped up sweet potato under the chicken while it bakes!  I also had some leftover caramelized onions that I threw in too, which was awesome.  I served it all over some quinoa and it was just fantastic!

These were very good, for chicken wings that didn't have to marinate for hours on end. They were very flavorful, I didn't use quite as much honey as it called for either. I reccommend that you line your pan with aluminum foil also. Loved the aroma of these baking.Served with homemade fried rice, it was a yummy meal!

This recipe was absolutely incredible!!! Of course, I had to put one extra clove of garlic into this recipe (I love garlic). My family raves about this chicken!!! I have never seen my step-dad clean a chicken bone soooo fastttt. With this particular meal I baked legs and wings together. I cooked the chicken for an extra 20 minutes, because the legs take a little longer to cook.

Easy and good.  I used legs and thighs rather than wings.  I also brushed the sauce on the chicken after it had cooked for about 30 minutes.

I seasoned 30pcs chicken wings with salt and pepper, prepared the sauce to the letter, added the chicken and let it marinate for an hour. Poured everything into a baking dish and baked it in a preheated oven at 375F COVERED with foil for 45mins (as suggested by some reviews) took off the foil and baked it for an additional 20mins. Sauce did thicken a bit and the wings had charred parts (no complaints about it). Served it with rice. No left overs&requests for more equals a success in my books.

I followed the altered recipe for boneless skinless and it was delicious! I also added 2 Tbsp of corn starch.  Boiled on stove for 5 - 10 min then poured over chicken, covered and baked 40 min, uncovered for last 15 min, basting every 5 min for the last 15 min.

I made the recipe exactly as written and the flavor was fantastic and the chicken extremely overcooked.  I'm going to try baking it much less time and I hope that the sauce will still caramelize.

This recipe was so easy, and absolutely delicious! I mixed everything in a freezer bag, dropped in my drum sticks, let them marinate for a couple of hours and then just dumped everything in baking dish. Husband had seconds and said "put this on the do again list" which in our house, that's a 5 star recipe!!

I have tried this with breast and wings.  The bottom line for me is that if you are going to make it, use the wings as suggested.  I have tried cooking the glaze on the stove top as recommended by other reviewers and I've just poured it over the chicken as written...  both yielded the same results with the wings caramelizing just a bit better.  I will continue to make this but I will certainly use wings and skip the stove top on the glaze.

Great chicken recipe!  I didn't have wings, instead used drumsticks and backed about 20 minutes longer to make sure they were done, wonderful flavor.

i cooked the sauce separately and poured it over some chicken tenderloin strips and baked until done. it was okay and i had a lot of sauce left. i added thin orange peels to the  left over sauce and cooked it in a pan for a few minutes and then turn off the heat while i stir fried some thin sirloin strips. removed the peels and added the sauce to the steaks and vegetables. it was great.

An awesome recipe that my family enjoyed, I added Sriracha hot sauce to it, make it over some fresh spinach and a bed of white rice and poured some of the juice from it over the rice. My family enjoyed it.

Just like the previous reviewer, my sauce didn't thicken. The chicken was moist and flavourful, granted, but I wasn't at all keen on the taste or the strong smell of the soya sauce/honey combination.

Came out better than I thought. Did cook the sauce over the stovetop as suggested and only poured half of it over the chicken and used the remainder 45 mins later.

I made this tonight and my family loved it! I used boneless, skinless breasts instead of wings. I did make a few changes - I added more garlic, brown sugar (@ 2 tbs) and some minced onion. It was too saucy for the few breasts I had, but we really enjoyed the flavor. I will be making this again!

My children absolutely loved this.  I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and like others suggested cooked my sauce on the stove.  However, I let the chicken thighs cook for about 15 minutes, drained them and then put the sauce on.  My children, who are picky about everything, absolutely loved these!  This will definitely be staple in our house!

Giving this 4 stars only because the sauce wasn't even as sticky and thick as I was hoping for. The taste is great and I will try this again making it with wings instead of boneless chicken breast. I also turned the chicken once while baking to ensure the flavor was even. All in all it was really good and the family loved it as well.

I baked this exactly as the recipe says, and the sauce was carmelized all right (at 45 minutes)... so much so that I had to take it outside because it was smoking so much and two of my smoke detectors went off.  When we brought it back in, we saw the chicken itself wasn't burned, so we still ate it.  It was not my favorite by any means, but it was edible.  It's possible that I did something wrong, or perhaps carmelized soy sauce just isn't my flavor.

Very good! I had 5 lbs bag of chicken wing so doubled the sauce.  But I think I didn't have to.  The original recipe could have been enough for 5 lbs chicken.

Doubled the recipe. I mixed everything up and put into a FoodSaver bag and tossed it into the freezer with the directions.  On the one I cooked, as others suggested, I reduced the sauce in a sauce pan and brushed over the wings.  Easy and delicious!

Very good! I recommend what a few other reviewers said: reduce sauce and add 2 tbsp of cornstarch. I actually used 3/4 cup honey because that's all I had left and it was still great. Also, baste 2 or 3 times ... really makes for a great wing night

These chicken wings are super tasty! They were a great addition to game day snacks! The only changes I made to the recipe was boiling the sauce on the stove for 10 min. This made the sauce really stick to the wings. And I also made a spicy version by adding 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes.

This was good, but did not caramelize.  Followed a reader's recommendation and boiled the sauce first, but apparently did not let it thicken enough.  Next time will use a little cornstarch.  Otherwise, was very tasty.

This recipe was so good.  My family loved it.  They say that it tasted like chinese food and made my house smell like a chinese restaurant.  :-) My 8yr is a very finicky eater.  She ate it and asked for seconds which I was glad to hear.  I wanted to try something different with chicken wings.  This was the perfect recipe.  Thanks Sandy.  I will definitely be making this one time after time.

Did not thicken even though I did on top of stove so left long in the oven to get to that sticky stage also did add cornstarch.  Nothing outstanding was ok.

This is a fantastic recipe, however I did not have the results that I wanted initially. I am not sure if I did something wrong. But I did not get a thick gooey sauce after baking the chicken in the oven. Instead the sauce was runny and watery. I meant to use the corn starch (as suggested) to thicken up the sauce but I was out of it. In order to save the recipe I placed the sauce and the chicken in a saucepan on the stovetop and simmered it on med-hi letting the sauce thicken for 5-10 minutes. It was phenomenal after that!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Awesome. Used chicken thighs, followed another reviewer's advice and thickened the sauce on the stove, added cornstarch, covered while baking the first 45 min and finished it off uncovered. What a great delicious recipe. Thank you!

Very good and easy! I used boneless chicken breast instead of chicken wings, which worked just fine. I did everything after the recipe for 3 servings, except that I only cooked the chicken for 30 min. and 350 degrees (in a convection oven) And after the chicken was done I transfered the sauce to a pan and added flour to get it a little thicker. It turned out delicious!

EXCELLENT RECIPE!! A welcome break from the same old chicken recipes. My son loved it so much he came by for the recipe for his family. I just added some crushed red pepper- (1 tsp.) to cut the sweetness, and I used a light soy sauce. It was delicious- I will be making this again.

This recipe kicks butt!  These wings were so awesome.  I had 12 wings, split in two.  I doubled the olive oil & ketchup and instead of the garlic clove, added 1 tsp each of garlic powder & onion powder.  I marinaded the wings in about 1/2 of the sauce for 8 hrs, then I dumped the wings & marinade on a parchment lined baking sheet.  After 15-20 min. in the oven, I poured the rest of the sauce over the wings & gave them a little toss to coat.  I let them bake, turning occasionally for about 45-50 min & then turned the oven off & let them sit in the oven for the last 10 min.  My kids thought I was the best mom on the planet (like there was any doubt).  Next time I think I'll add more garlic though but these were truly delicious, the meat fell off the bone & the sauce was a caramelly, gooey bit of heaven. Thanks Sandy - you rock!

Very good!  Although, next time I will take the suggestion from others and cook the sauce on top of the stove first to thicken it up a tad bit more.  I used wings and the sauce was very good, and actually carmelized pretty well, but I would liked to have seen it a little thicker.

I have made this chicken twice.  Once with chicken thighs and once with boneless skinless breasts, both times they were wonderful.  I did add less ketchup and squirted in a little Sriracha sauce/ asian chile sauce for a little bite to it.  My family loves it.  They have asked for it at least once a week since I made it the first time.

Made this chicken last night but had to alter the ingredients.  I added 1/2 of a bell and red pepper.  I also added more garlic than the recipe required.  The chicken was OK but it was lacking something.  I will make this recipe again but lessening the honey and perhaps adding orange zest.  Good but not the greatest.

Absolutely delicious! I cooked the sauce on the stovetop beforehand to thicken it up (added a little cornstarch/water). Cut up a whole chicken, cooked it 20 mins then turned over and cooked another 20-30 mins. Basted with sauce several times during cooking. Meanwhile cooked a pot of rice and when chicken was done, removed skin, cut up chicken and made perfect terikayi rice bowls. Would have been perfect with green onions if I had them. Husband LOVED and friend who showed up unanncounced devoured! A Keeper! Thanks!

After baking these for an hour, the meat just fell off the bone. While my sauce was a bit runny, the juice tasted great over beans, corn and carrots!

The great thing about this recipe is.. if you add in some garlic, ginger and red pepper flakes, you now have General Tsu sauce! You can do so many things with this recipe!

Loved the BBQ sauce! I grilled some green onions at the same time and tossed them ontop to serve. Very yummy moist chicken. I started the chicken on the grill for a couple of minutes on both sides, then put the sauce ontop and finished baking it in the oven for about 20 minutes.

Wonderful sauce, but it was a little to thin. I had to boil it with cornstarch after the chicken cooked to thicken it up. Served over rice.

Too much sauce for my down sized recipe.  Didn't caramelize.  Will try again with less sauce.  Tasted good, though.

I made this for dinner a few nights ago for my family and it was a hit!  I followed the recipe exactly but used chicken breasts instead of wings.  Will make it again, it was fast and easy.

SO YUMMY!!  I used this on bone in skinless chicken breasts, so scaled the recipe down for 2 of us.  What a yummy sauce on the chicken, so good!  The only thing I did that some of the other reviewers did as well was to boil the sauce on the stove before baking in the oven.  I recommend this as I do think it helps with the caramelizing part of the recipe.  A definite repeat!

I was a lil short on the honey so it wasn't sweet enough. I threw in a lil brown sugar to sweeten it up. Came out great! The sauce didn't thicken up prob because of that, but next time i'll make sure to buy extra honey.

Incredible wings... I would eat these again and again.  I always boil the ingredients a little bit before adding to the chicken so that the sauce is thicker and sticks better to the chicken.

Very good. I used the tip from another reviewer to make this with boneless skinless chicken breasts. Next time I think I'll add some cornstarch...it was still pretty runny. Went good over ginger rice.

very tasty. I halved the sauce recipe because I used about 1.5 pounds of boneless skinless chicken thighs. I also put about half the amount of honey because it just seemed like a lot when I was measuring it out. I lined a pan with aluminum foil and cooked the chicken for 35 minutes at 375*, turning it over halfway.

This is very good. I cut the chicken up into thick strips. I prepared the sauce as suggested by Meredith since I used skinless boneless chicken. I baked for around 45 mins then put them into a crock pot to stay warm for a party. They were the first things to go! Delicious! (Definitely need to use low-sodium soy sauce for this)

This was pretty good. Had a great sweet with a slight spice flavor. I did have to take it out of the oven and put it in a pan on the stove with some corn starch to thicken it up. But still tasty.

My husband loved these wings! They were great.  The first time I covered the wings for half the baking time and the sauce never thickened.  The second time I reduced the sauce on the stove top first and left uncovered to bake the entire time. Delicious :)

First I would suggest if you want "sticky" chicken, then follow other reviewers suggestions for thicker sauce.  If you follow the recipe as it is, only one side will be sticky.  The sauce just rolled off my drumsticks as I poured it on.  Second, Even though I put down tin foil, the sauce stuck badly to my pan.  I was not happy about that.  The smell after about 20 minutes was not pleasant. Although it tasted fine (my husband actually quite enjoyed it) it was definitly not a keeper in my opinion.

The flavor was pretty good. As others stated, it needs to be thickened on the stove before being poured onto the chicken. I would also add some cornstarch to help with this.

This was pretty good! My mom really loved it. I was sad the sauce wasn't thicker and didn't really caramelize. Looking over the reviews now, I see that some people posted helpful modifications to get thick sauce.

This recipe was just ok. I heated up the ingredients on the stovetop and added a little cornstarch and that indeed make the sauce caramelize when it was baked on the chicken but to me it tasted the same as any other kind of bottled bbq sauce. Warning! You will have to soak and scrub the heck out of your baking dish when done because of the sauce.

Excellent.  Made this for dinner tonight...Followed the recipe exactly except for using boneless/skinless chicken breasts, adding 2 TBS corn-starch to sauce and cooking the sauce on stove-top until it thickened.  Personally, we found that the soy sauce was a little overpowering... but...We ended up going back for seconds.   Will definitely make this again and again cutting back on the soy sauce and tweaking the recipe to suit our personal tastes.  Thanks!!!

This is a great recipe! I used garlic powder instead and added sriracha to give it a little kick. I used a little more soy sauce (about a tbsp) and didn't add any salt. I used drumsticks because they were cheaper. I also broiled the chicken for a few minutes on each side to get it nice and crispy. I will definitely make this recipe again!!!

LOVE. SO good.  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly (except I halved it) and took advice from other reviews and boiled the sauce on the stove top first to thicken it a little.  Then I poured it over the chicken, tossed/coated the pieces well, and put it in the oven to cook and turned them halfway through.  So good that I ate too much!!  Will definitely make again and again and again....

Very good.  Taking the advice of one of the reviewers on the main page, I wanted to use 3/4c honey and ketchup.  However, when I started assembling everything, I realized we were almost out out of ketchup!  I only had about 1/4c, so I added 1/2c BBQ sauce to it.  Boiled that, along with the honey, soy sauce, garlic, and pepper, on the stove for a few minutes and poured it over chicken wings.  I had way more than enough sauce and ended up with about 1/4c leftover.  My wings were done after about 45 minutes, however, the sauce wasn't quite caramelized like I hoped.  Next time I may try turning the broiler on for a few minutes after the wings are nearly done to finish the sauce off.  Overall, very good recipe.

The sauce didn't caramelize at all, and although the sauce had decent flavor, the chicken itself was rubbery and not flavorful.

These were sooo good! I followed the recipe exactly except for keeping them in the oven fifteen minutes longer than what it called for and they carmelized perfectly! Infact they were so good everyone insisted I make them again this evening. :0) Thanks for a great recipe, it's a keeper!

I made this with boneless skinless chic. breasts.  I read the other reviews and boiled the sauce before hand to thicken it up.  My kids really liked this recipe.  I will try it with wings next time!

Kids loved the drum sticks, they were cooked perfect.  I did some skinless breasts with the drumsticks and found they were a little over cooked and dry. Will reduce cooking time if doing skinless.

This recipe is very easy and delicious.  The hubby loved it.  I used about 3/4 cup of honey, added a few splashes of hot sauce and simmered for about 10 min b4 pouring over chicken.  Will definitely cook again.

My family LOVED this recipe.  Iwould definitely recommend it.  The only thing I added was a little crushed ginger from a jar and starting half hour in, I basted it with a little extra sauce I had left over.  It was perfect! I sprinkled some green onion over the top and ate it with white rice.  Spectacular~!

I make this all the time. I add a little more spices to kick it up a notch or two. I like to add 2 tsp of finely mince ginger and 2 tsp of finely minced lemon grass together. Instead of 1/2 cup of soy sauce I would use 1/4 cup and 1/4 cup of hoison sauce. It makes this a more southeast Asian dish with the garlic, ginger and lemon grass. I also chop up scallions and top it on the dish with some roughly ground black peppers. Makes it look really attractive and adds some extra taste to it.You can find more fresh and affordable lemongrass at any asian supermarket. You can find Hoison and ginger pretty much any where now.

I used this on two boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I followed the sauce measurements exactly as the recipe called for. I first boiled it in a sauce pan and added 2 tbsp cornstarch to help thicken it up a bit. That helped. Then I poured the sauce over the chicken and cooked it at 375 until the internal temperature reached the "poultry" line. I think that's 180 degrees. The sauce didn't caramelize on the chicken. It was more like a very thick dipping sauce. But it did taste absolutely fantastic and I'll make this again in the future. Next time though, I'll use chicken wings and see how that turns out.

Super easy and a great dress-up for cheaper cuts (I used leg quarters). Did what a few others suggested and simmered down on stove before applying to de-skinned thighs and drumsticks. Also added about a tablespoon of red pepper flakes and brown sugar because honey was running low. BF said to "add to my box" to do again.

Absolutely delicious.  The entire family loved it.  I will definitely keep this recipe as a favorite.  I used drumsticks instead of chicken wings.  I marinated the chicken in the sauce overnight.  Next time I may add some red pepper flakes to give it a sweet and spicy taste.

Followed the directions, but my sauce never got thick. It was good, but you can do the same thing with a bottle of Lawry's  Teriyaki marinade.

This was great. My family loved the chicken. Of course, I made some changes. I used thighs and drumsticks. I also cut the honey to 1/2 cup and I added 1/2tsp. of Dave's Insanity hot sauce. I basted the chicken with the sauce about 4 times during baking. The chicken was crisp, moist and tangy. Wonderful!

I made this for friends the other night and it was a big hit!  I used chicken drumsticks; seasoned with garlic powder and baked them for fifteen minutes, pouring off the excess juices.  Took tips from others to make thicker and cooked sauce on stove top first and then poured over chicken.  Baked for 20 minutes in a glass pan.  Came out perfect!  Will be making again using wings. :)

Made this w/ 1/2t of chili paste and 3 shots of beyond Z.  Definitely only needed 1 shot of the Z as it was spicy as hell. 2 shakes of Z would be better.  You do need to boil down and thicken the sauce to get what your looking for though.  The taste is fantastic but recipe needs modification.

Very good flavor, I cut up chicken breasts & made with brown rice & brocoli, and mixed it all together. Which was awesome, but next time I'll mix less of the sauce in with it. It was uber salty! I think I'll cut back on the soy sauce just a little next time. Really good though.

I used drumsticks and thighs.  Absolutely delicious.  My family loved it.  I found I had to turn up the heat to about 425 for the last 15 minutes to fully carmelize.   Will make this one again.

My family and I didnt care for this recipe at all.  I did give a 3* because the chicken was extremely tender.. I used chicken breasts as well and when I could see there was too much sauce, I poured most of it out.. It glazed but we just didnt care for the flavor at all.   It was worth a try and it was edible.. it just didnt tickle our fancy.

This was SOOOO good! I used boneless skinless thighs, a little more ketchup (a little more than a half cup), and 3 cloves of garlic (I could have used 4, it wasn't garlicky at all). I boiled the sauce on the stove as suggested and poured it over the thighs. Baked at 350 for 45 minutes. This was delicious served over brown rice!!!

Best chicken ever.  And easy.  Use skinless drumsticks instead of wings, turn 2-3 times during baking and these melt in your mouth. Don't expect to have leftovers =D

Delicious. I thickened sauce with a small amount of cornstarch and brought to a boil in a pan on the stove and poured bubbly hot over chicken, before placing in oven. Corn syrup in place of honey was just fine. I turned/basted chicken several times during baking.

I didn't read any of the reviews before I made this, so like many others, my sauce didn't caramelize. It was basically the consistency of water. So, after baking, I put the sauce in a pot on the stove and boiled with a little cornstarch mixed with water to thicken it up. I tossed the wings with the sauce and it tasted fantastic. I will make again following suggestions of other reviewers and thicken the sauce beforehand.

Yum, I'll be making this again for sure! I did modify by: cutting back on the honey; added about 1 tsp of ground ginger, an extra clove of minced garlic, a little orange juice, about 1 tablespoon of brown sugar and a teaspoon of sesame oil. I only wish I had added some crushed red pepper. The chicken was falling off the bone and the sauce was wonderful. Warning - the sauce doesn't taste that good by itself (i.e., dipping your finger in before adding to the chicken) but it's really really good once it's baked onto the chicken.   I also basted the wings every 10-15 min or so during cooking and cooked at 400 uncovered the entire time.

This was awesome and super easy!  Enjoyed it with veggie stir fry and white rice.  Better than chinese food.  Oh, I also added sesame seeds which really gave it a kick:)

This was very tasty. I even tried a wing myself and agreed it was tasty (and usually I won't touch bone-in meat). The only things I changed were that I ran out of honey and had to make up the difference (around 1/4 c.) with orange marmalade. (Well, it was that or strawberry preserves...which probably would have been good too.) I also added around 3/4c. of chopped green onions to the sauce halfway through, and 1/4 c. dehydrated onions to the sauce right from the start. (We like onions...) The only thing I did NOT like about this recipe was the overwhelming flavor of soy sauce in the drippings. Since I served the drippings over brown rice, and will again, I'll need to do something about that soy sauce...think I'll just experiment with reducing the overall amount of soy sauce til I get it perfect. Thanks for a wonderful recipe! (P.S. I did use wings with skin, my sauce did caramelize, but if you are expecting it to turn into something thick and sticky on bottom you'll burn it..the chicken leaks grease which will liquefy the juice! The caramelization takes place ON the chicken skin, and that worked perfectly.)

This was so easy and so good!  I had everything in the house that I needed.  I made it with boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of the wings.  I would probably cook at a higher temp the next time or reduce the sauce before baking so that it actually comes out more carmelized looking.  Overall, I give this 4-1/2 stars, and will definitely make this again!  Thanks for submitting it.

Made this for a birthday BBQ and they lasted 15 minutes. They didn't even have time to cool down. I drained the extra sauce out of the pan 15 minutes before they were done so they would carmelize more.

I love this recipe.  It is the same one my mom used to make when I was a child. It serves great with rice. I think it is better with chicken wings. Much more fun to eat.

Quick, easy, and not too bad for the waistline! I could not ask for a better recipe. The best part of this recipe is that it uses household ingredients you usually already have at home. I make it with chicken breast though, so I follow the tips from the other reviews. I simmer the sauce before... you gotta simmer it for at least 15 minutes. This recipe is a definite keeper!!!

Well, even after reading all the reviewers suggestions on how to make this "sticky" instead of soupy, mine still did not turn out sticky.....BUT the flavor was SO GOOD, I didn't even care !  Served with the good old fashioned Campbells recipe for "souper rice".  Leftovers were EXCELLENT over lettuce, etc as a dinner salad!!  Definitely making this again!

Darn good. Wouldn't change much. I cut back on the honey a bit. Glazed over real nice in the convection oven in about 45 minutes. The garlic burned though..gotta figure that one out. Recommend using the wings, as the meat just falls off the bone. Very tender. Will do again. Soon.

This was easy and fantastic! I used boneless skinless breasts and wasn't too worried about the "stickiness" so the sauce was a little thin... but we just sopped it up like bbq sauce! I will make this again!

I loved this, but was disappointed in the watery consistency of the sauce.  I will use less oil next time to hope it will help.  I added Paprika and Chili and it was awesome.

Very good.  Used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  To thicken sauce, I added a corn starch/water mixture directly into the baking dish a few minutes before serving.

These baked wings were delicious! I used all drumettes instead of wings, and they were all eated up so fast at my holiday party, with people asking me if I had more! I agree that the sauce wasn't as thick as it could have been when I poured it over the top of them, however I countered that problem by basting them every 10-15 minutes throughout the baking time and I think they were as delicious as could be! I can't wait to try this with boneless breasts.

I enjoyed the chicken very much, although i did follow some of the other reviews and cooked the sauce over the stove with a tablespoon of cornstarch to make it thicker. I then poured the sauce over the chicken and wrapped it tightly in foil so that it would boil the chicken in the sauce to make it more tender. i baked it for about 45 minutes wrapped up tight and then 15 more minutes opened up. This is also ideal if you don't want to make too much of a mess.

Good flavor!  Tried this on chicken wings and they were very tender.  Would be good on other cuts of chicken.

I used this recipe with chicken leg quarters, and as my 5 year old son kept saying through dinner, "This is the best chicken that you ever made mom!"  It was so easy and delicious.  A definite keeper!  Thank you!

I followed the recipe, and was very happy with how easy it was to make.

The sauce did not carmelize for me, but the flavor was still good. We liked other wings better, so next time I'll try this recipe with chicken thighs.

I did not care for these. It may have been due to the fact that I used  the crock pot instead of baking. I would think about trying them again some time and would follow the directions as listed.

I used 1/2 cup ketsup and 1/3 cup honey, and cooked the sauce on the stove top, and then put in thinly sliced boneless skinless breasts.  I put it in the 400 degree oven for 15 minutes, and finito! My boyfriend thought it was tasty.  He is eager to eat it again very soon!!

I followed the directions exactly and I found that the next time I make it, I will take about 20 minutes off the cooking time.  The sauce started to burn.  Even so, it tasted very good.

definitely tasty. I was looking for something to do with wings that was easy. This recipe met that need. I gave it 4 stars b/c it was a little messy/gooey. But other than that it was very tastey. As per other reviewers I added some ginger.

Very good weekday dinner. Easy! I cooked the sauce on the stove and thickened it a bit with corn starch. I even added a teaspoon of fresh ginger...delicious!
My husband, children and I each enjoyed it.

I've got the sauce to carmelize.  I made the sauce as directed, added 2tsp of cornflower (NO WATER) and heated on the stove top.  Poured over chicken and covered to bake.  Half way through I uncovered it and turned each piece of chicken over.  Continued baking uncovered.  Only thing I will do differently next time is be more liberal with the seasoning.

This had a great Asian barbeque taste to it. I was pleasantly surprised. Here are my changes. First I used chicken tenders. Than I cooked the sauce in the pan first as suggested. Used more garlic and only like 1/2 cup honey.(I measure by eye and taste) Than I put a tablespoon of  flour to thicken it up. which it did!! Had no problem there.. Put in the oven for 18 mins at 400. Great dish and went well with green beans and tomatoes from this site.

This is now one of our favourite ways to prepare chicken. Thanks for such a great, simple recipe. I followed some of the other reviewer's suggestions and cooked boneless skinless at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. Came out very tender and not dry at all. Thanks again.

I originally gave this recipe a 5 but am giving it a 4 because I need to differentiate between good and great.  This was just good.  I followed others advice and thickened the sauce on the stove before adding it to the chicken.  I also cooked the chicken for about 40 minutes, not 60, as noted in the recipe.  Will use again. Thanks!

Mine didn't seem to caramalize. Maybe I messed up. The sauce was good, but I will probably do a rue if I make this again.

I halved the recipe to cook 3 skinless breasts.  I only had about 1/4 cup of honey and made up the other 1/4+ cup with Karo light corn syrup (its what I had on hand).  I mixed all ingredients and brought to a boil in a cast iron skillet.  I added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch dissolved in 3 tablespoons cold water to the mixture and boiled about 2 minutes.  I added my 3 breasts and popped the skillet in the oven.  I set the timer for 15 minutes and brushed the sauce; I set the timer again for 15 minutes and brushed again.  The breasts were about done (145 degrees) at this point so I put back in the oven for another 6-7 minutes and it was perfect.  I cooked at 375 by the way.

This recipe is WAY OVER RATED!!! There has to be an ingrediant missing, cause just like all the other reviews i read the sauce DID NOT carmelize, and by cooking the chicken for the length of time listed it really dried it out, and now my house smells like burnt soy sauce. I WILL NEVER AGAIN MAKE THIS RECIPE

This was EXCELLENT! My husband loved it. It is a great new way to have baked chicken. I used a cut up fryer chicken rather than wings only and it was fantastic! This one goes into my favorites.

A nice change from other baked chicken recipes. The carmelizing worked well for me, I just made sure to baste the chicken often.

This was pretty good. Just average marinated chicken to me. The sauce did seem more like a marinade. I was expecting something more like a glaze. I added a few dashes of hot sauce for some heat. Good, but not exciting.

I use this recipe often now because it is not only delisious, but easy! I substitute about half of the honey with molasses and it gives it a richer flavor and darker color. I also use boneless chicken.

I use this recipe for marinade too!!! It's PERFECT for steaks and chicken. The steaks are soooo tender and yummy! We're having it for dinner tonight! :) I never really measure this recipe anymore and find that a little less honey and a little more soy sauce add an extra zing.

Definate hit with the family.  We had just traveled home on Thanksgiving after a week of camping.  I was not planning to do the traditional dinner, and was just looking for something easy to make after a day in the car.  I started this recipe only to realize I did not have honey.  I was following the tips for the thicker sauce w/ boneless breasts.   Since I was out of honey and the stores were closed I substituted maple syrup.  THis turned out fabulous.  Sweat and spicy.   My husband thinks the sauce would also go great with those little smokies sausages we make for parties.

Made a nice tasting "teriyaki" flavored marinade but never carmelized and really didn't come out how its described in the recipe. :o(

I followed another's suggestion and cooked the sauce on the stove top first, and added some corn starch.  I also used chicken quarters and wasn't concerned about the sauce sticking to the chicken.  I just used it as a sauce to pour over rice.  Turned out great.  Next time, I'll try it using boneless and skinless chicken breast meat.

This wasn't entirely what I expected. It was more of the type of flavored chicken that you get at Chinese restaurants. Still tasty, though!

LOVED IT! So simple and easy. None of the tastes over powered the others. The sauce was delicious. It was a little runnier than I thought a 'caramelized' look should be. Maybe next time I'll try what others said and cook the sauce for a bit before adding it with the chicken. But will definitely make this dish again! Thanks for sharing.

My family loved this!  I made the sauce and simmered cut up chicken breasts in it on the stovetop for 20-30 minutes. I did follow suggestions and add a couple of tablespoons of cornstarch mixed in some water to thicken it up a little.  Served it over brown rice cooked in chicken broth.  My husband declared it one of his favorites now!  I think next time I will use a little less honey, as it was very sweet, but it's great as is.
Update:  Adding cut-up broccoli (frozen or fresh) when the chicken is simmering and cooking it in the sauce is wonderful also.  Sometimes I add a little red pepper flakes to add some heat.

My husband and I both liked this very much.  Though I did make some changes- I substituted sesame seed oil for the olive oil, I added ground ginger to the sauce, and I added a thinly sliced onion.  It came out wonderfully!  It was great served over coconut rice (rice cooked with a bit of coconut milk) and stir fried bell peppers.  It made a great Asian themed meal.  We'll be having this again.

Oh my word!  This is incredible!  We made this recipe as wings.  We went to a restaurant after making these a few times, and my husband ordered wings.  Right in front of the waitress we both said, "These don't taste as good as the ones we make at home!"  

We have even used this recipe on boneless skinless thighs! A+++

This recipe was simple to make and very tasty. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts instead of wings and it was great.  The sauce was great for dipping!  Like most of the others, the sauce did not caramelize, but I will try the cornstarch idea next time.  Thanks for sharing this.

After reading all the reviews, the only thing I did differently was to leave out the garlic, used chicken breast and lined the pan with Reynolds non-stick foil (that stuff is worth every penny) Anyway the sauce never really caramelized but we used the sauce to go over the rice. I think it would have been better if the sauce was sticky but no one at my house complained and we ate the whole thing

This was tasty, but I agree with some of the other reviewers that it didn't really carmelize.  (Plus, the sauce nearly ruined the glass baking dish we cooked it in.  If you bake it, either use a disposable roasting pan or line the baking dish with foil!!!)  I halved the chicken so I would have double the sauce to pour over rice.  To thicken the sauce I used some of the reviewer suggestions and added 2 tbs cornstarch and brought it to a boil for a few minutes.  Half of it I poured over the chicken to bake and the extra sauce I left on the stove simmering on low.  The sauce in the pan with the chicken came out MUCH thinner than the sauce I left on the stove top, which had a nice syrupy consistency.  Since it didn't carmelize, I think this recipe would be faster and easier, and just as good, if you cooked the chicken and sauce in a frying pan on top of the stove.  However, I did love this simple but delicious sauce; I am always looking for new ways to dress up plain old chicken!  To me it tasted like something you'd get at a chinese restaurant.

My family absolutely loves this recipe.  We use chicken breasts and marinate them in the sauce for about an hour.  We then grill them on the bbq.  They are always a hit at our outdoor gatherings.

Thanks for sharing the recipe.  In the past when I didn't have any honey on hand I substituted either Karo syrup or maple syrup and it turned out great that way also!  I have made this many times...sauce does need to thicken with extra help :D  Thank you once again!

This is a perfect recipe for a busy mom or dad or someone who doesn't like to spend much time in the kitchen. It's easy, not a lot of dishes, and I think it would cater to most tastes, kids for sure! It's kind of basic so I think I'll try to add fresh ginger or grpefruit juice next time. But overall it's good.

I made this with Chicken wings. I must admit that I was pretty disappointed that the sauce was so runny. I will make this again but only with skinless chicken and I will add some cornstarch to thicken the sauce

Good concept for this recipe. I changed it a bit by cutting the honey down to 1/4 cup and added 1-1/2 cup of appricot preserves. My family really liked it, and it carmelized as it should. I would make again

My family liked this dish!  Tastes like a good teriyaki sauce and it's very easy to make.  Although, pouring a bottle of your favorite teriyaki sauce over the chicken would be easier with the same results.  I made this with chicken legs and turned them every 15 minutes while baking.  Like many others have said, the sauce stayed thin.  I think the thickness of the sauce depends on the quantity of water in each brand of soy sauce.  The sauce tasted great on the rice I served on the side.

Very very good. I used 2 cloves of garlic, just because we liked it. If you are like me and only making two boneless, skinless breasts, you can probably only make half as much sauce (will do that time). The breasts seemed to be done after about 20mins on 375, but I let it go an extra 20mins to get a good carmelization on the chicken.

Just delicious. I used the ingredients listed, but didn't really measure things.. just used what looked right. I used chicken breasts and had no trouble with the sauce being runny. I did mariante the chicken in the mixture overnite, then poured the whole thing into a pan the next day and baked. Wondefully easy.

I've been craving this chicken since I ate it.  I'm making it again tonight.  This recipe was excellent.  Only problem I had was that the sauce was very thin.  I added some cornstarch to the liquid and it thickened up nicely.  I took some of the hot liquid out of the pan, mixed in some cornstarch to the liquid I removed and put it back in again.  Yum, Yum....

This was SOOOO good!!  When my extremely picky family talks about when I'm fixing this dish again as they are eating 2nds and 3rds, I know it's a hit :) The sauce was DELICIOUS! But it does make a ton....I was worried it wouldn't be enough because I used 4-5 lbs. of legs and thighs....we had PLENTY.  After the chicken was done, I transferred it to a platter, poured the sauce in a small saucepan and thickened with a little cornstarch.  We poured it over our chicken and wished that I'd fixed rice to pour the sauce over too.  YUM YUM!  Will make again and again!  I will probably follow other reviewers suggestions next time, and remove some sauce with a turkey baster to allow the sauce to carmelize and thicken more while baking.

I originally tried this with boneless chicken breast, it was good but not spectacular as the sauce didn't thicken up enough in the time it took to cook the chicken.  I would have given it 3 or 4 stars based upon that first experience.  MY fault of course because the recipe calls for wings, can't fault the other for that, it simply won't harden up in the amount of time it takes to cook chicken w/o the bone.

The next time however I used thighs w/ bone and it turned out great!!  I will make this regularly.

my husband loved this.  I enjoyed it as well ( though, not as much).  Seems like it's missing something--maybe a citrus element to tone done the honey-soy, which was a little strong.  I may try lemon, ginger, or even cider vinegar next time.

Wonderful!  My children loved this and so did I!  I followed everything except I used low-sodium soy sauce and did not add salt (my blood pressure is up!).  Didn't miss it!  Also, I've made this more than once with different cuts of chicken -- all turn out terrific -- but turning once or twice during cooking is a good idea to keep the top from burning.  I serve it over rice with the sauce.  Brown rice to add some health! (no one noticed!)  Yum!

Superb!  I used a whole chicken with this...it was soft and falling off the bone!  I seasoned the chicken first with season all, and rubbed my signature mix of shredded onions, parsely, thyme and garlic on the chicken, so I ommitted added the garlic to the sauce.  If you don't want too strong a flavor, I would suggest, using a light soy sauce.  Thanks for the recipe..will definitely make again!

awesome! i halved the recipie in half because i was making it for just my boyfriend and myself. i used 4 drumsticks, added 2 tsp of brown sugar and a little bit of montreal spicy seasoning. i lightly coated them in the sauce first and used the rest of the marinade as a baste. i basted every 15-20 mins and it carmelized BEAUTIFULLY. they were so sticky and awesome, i bet they'd be even better on a grill :)

The smell was bad and it tasted smoky sweet when it finally finished cooking. I followed the directions exactly... I will not be making this again.

I used this on skinless boneless chicken breasts. It looked beautiful. I thought the taste was a little too salty. (could be the brand of soy sauce) My huband and son both liked it. Clean up wasn't so easy. All in all a good recipe. I'll probably make it again.

My husband and I live overseas and really miss the variety of chicken wings that are available in US restaurants. This recipe takes care of those cravings and then some. I will be adding this to my recipes to make for friends that want to eat something "typical American". Awesome.

This is always an easy thing to do with chicken breasts or tenders.  Sometimes the sauce isn't to carmelly, but it still has that sweet taste and if served over rice, it makes a nice sauce.

Unfortunately this recipe didn't work out for me.  It came out pretty gross.  My husband ate one piece and the rest has been sitting in the refrigerator because I couldn't bring myself to throwing out the chicken right out the oven.

My mother used to make a honey chicken for me when I was a child, and I was thrilled when I found this recipe and it came out tasting so similar to Mom's!  I usually do not use wings, but rather boneless or bone-in thighs (brests dry out quicker), or drumsticks.  We usually serve this with a plain basmati rice, as we find it a bit sweet to eat by itself.

I've made this many times, the last time I made it, it came out perfect!!  Carmalized and DELICIOUS!  I use chicken thighs, and some advice of other ppl that have made this recipe, I cooked the sauce first, I added a few tablespoons of brown sugar, and a few drops of lemon concentrate.  Cooked it on the lowest grill in the oven and PERFECT Thanks so much for a yummy recipe!!!

very popular with the men folk at my house!  Made a huge plate for some guys the other day and it was gone in 5-10 minutes...one of those kind of things that men just hover around. I did use a previous reviewer's advise and cooked on the pampered chef bar pan - carmalized very nicely.

These wings were only okay.  We cut the recipe in half and found that - although the flavour was not offensive, they were really missing something.  I think if I were to make these again (and that's debatable), I would add more garlic (we added 1 full clove with half the sauce ingredients), and probably add some fresh grated ginger.  On the plus side, I baked them for about an hour at 425 degrees, and they turned out to be very tender and had a nice dark colour.

This recipe was wonderful. My girls, who are very picky, even asked for it again. The only change I made was using skinless thighs instead of wings... awesome! Next time I will try reducing the honey - even my kids thought it was too sweet. This is definitely a keeper!

I have tried this recipe on three different occasions and have not been able to get the sauce to carmelize yet! I have tried less soy sauce and extra honey, neither one worked. I end up just draining the sauce and adding barbeque sauce and browning that. The flavor is pretty good but I was looking for a more gooey wing sauce.

Was quick and easy.  But I agree with the previous reader, that the flavor was mild.  Sauce was not very thick so if you prefer thick sauce, you will have to adjust recipe.  Also this is much better on dark meat.  Husband thought it was okay and I agree.

With so many saying the sauce doesnt carmelize, I did the recipe differently. My sauce alterations: doubled the garlic, used about 3/4 cup honey, and about 1/3-maybe 1/4-cup soy sauce (teriyaki sounds interesting...I'll have to try it). Marinated cubed chicken for about 2 hrs in the sauce. I cubed potatoes and put them in an oven bag, then poured the marinated chicken over this evenly. Baked at 350 for 45 min- 1 hr. When it finished I mixed in whole green beans that I cooked on the side. This was an awesome oven-made stir-fry! I cant recommend it enough!!

OK, I'm giving this recipe 3 stars because I think it has pretty good potential. As is, I personally think its WAY too sweet(and I love sweet sauces and marinades). I might try this again using 1/2 cup honey (which I think would be more than enough) and 1/2 cup orange juice (hubbies suggestion). Definitely a kid pleaser however, my 10 and 6 yr old devoured them. My husband and I ate them, but both agreed that it's just way to sweet.  I saw alot of reviews that said the sauce didn't carmalize- not ALL the sauce is going to carmalize, only the sauce that sticks to the wings will carmalize and that they did very nicely!

I used 1/3 of a recipe for 1 lb 3 oz of wings.  I omitted oil.  I used light soy sauce.  Ran out of regular honey so I used half orange blossom honey.  I flipped the wings over a few times to help them caramelize.  My fiance said "Not something I'd request, but they were good."  In other words, they weren't good enough for me to keep the recipe.

very easy to make w/ a wonderful sweetness similar to teriyaki sauce (but better)! i heated the sauce in a pot first to assure caramelization...but don't worry if your sauce doesn't b/c you can just drizzle it over rice.  tastes great w/ fish or pork too!

Yum.  Easy to make and bake.  Turned the oven up to 400F for the last ten minutes - turned out delicious and sticky.  Great for a football game.

What a great flavor!  The sauce didn't carmelize but I don't think I would want it too.  The wings had a wonderful taste and were nice a juicy.  My husband commented on them twice during the meal and afterwards he said again, "These are REALLY good, what's in the sauce?"  I have already made them again.  Thanks for sharing!

I did what others suggested and cooked the sauce for about 15 mins at a simmer, and thickened the sauce a bit.  I used chicken breasts, and I didn't have a problem with the sauce sticking to the meat.  I used the remainder of the sauce over rice, and it was a good, quick meal.  I added extra garlic and just eyeballed the honey amount as well as adding a little more ketchup.

I put the sauce over the chicken in a bag and marinated it overnight and grilled it the next day. My husband ate three wings right off the grill before supper it was that good.

This sauce is absolutely fantastic!  I can't believe how simple it is, with so few ingredients.  I have made it several times now.  Lining my baking pan with foil makes for super fast and easy clean-up.  Definitely a keeper!

This was a good tasting meal, but there was something missing.  It had an Asian taste, so I served it with brown rice.  I did make the sauce in a saucepan, thickened with a little cornstarch mixture, and then pour it over the chicken.  The chicken produces so much liquid, though, that the "sticky" sauce becomes watery and slides right off the chicken.  I ended up, half way through the baking, taking the chicken, putting it on a broiler pan, and basting it often with the sticky sauce.  I wish I would have done this the entire baking time to ensure the chicken had plenty of this good tasting sauce.  (NOTE:  I used boneless, skinless breast.)

My husband also liked it.I made it in a slow cooker-on bake at 375 and put it outside cause have the air on - it is so hot outside.It was great - Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I was sadly disappointed in this recipe, which sounded so good! The sauce did not caramelize, and this recipe, although very easy, had no pizazz.

It was okay, but the honey made a gigantic mess in my oven and made my whole apartment smell like honey for days (granted, my apartment is only one room). Not worth the effort.

Delicious!  Sweet, tangy sauce...everyone loved them.  You could probably use any type of chicken (i.e. drumsticks, thighs, etc.) and it would be wonderful.

We really liked this recipe a lot.  Usually recipes fall into either kid recipes or adult recipes around our house.  So I love it when we find something the whole family likes.  I used boneless skinless breasts that I cut up into strips.  Mine turned out a little on the dry side, but thats because I could see the sauce was starting to carmelize, and I decided to leave it in long enough for that to happen.  Maybe I will cut my strips just a little larger next time, as we dont really like wings all that much.  Delicious flavor though, and very very easy.

All of the recipes I have found on this website have been 5-star (in my own opinion, and I also look for those who are rated as such). However, this recipe was okay, but nothing special. I used boneless skinless breasts, and the sauce mixture burned on the bottom of the pan just like another reviewer. The taste was fine, but nothing out of the ordinary although the chicken was dried out (and I basted it every 10 min). Didn't carmelize either. Would have turned out the same if I just cooked the chicken breast in my George Forman and drizzled sauce over it. Don't think I'll try this one again.

Very good recipe.  I cooked the sauce on the stovetop with some arrowroot to thicken it a bit and then pored over skinless breasts.  I will try it with boneless thighs next time.

This was good..flavour was good but oddly familiar.  Didn't carmelize or thicken up.  I didn't bother trying to get it to do so like some raters did.  Instead I put some of the sauce over rice.  It was good.

We liked this alot. I used split chicken breast and probably should have cooked it only 45 minutes. I also used a smaller pan and the liquid boiled over. Delicious sauce. It did caremlize a little bit. Will try it again.

This was average.  I added 1 tbsp. cornstarch mixed with 1 tbsp. water to the sauce before baking and it thickened fairly well, but wasn't anything like it was raved to be.  I liked that it was fast and that's why I gave it a 3 instead of a 2.  Won't make again.

I didn't have a problem with the chicken caramelizing at all.  I did use the sauce as a marinade overnight. (What could it hurt?) Then I placed the wings on a foiled lined cookie sheet with no extra sauce, baked at 350 for about 40 minutes, turned them over and baked at 275 for another 25 or so.  Because I used the sauce as a marinade in raw chicken, I did not use the it for any other purpose.  The wings caramelized beautifully!  The 4 star rating designates a not to exciting recipe.  Probably won't make it again as there are sooooo many recipes and so little time!

It takes just minutes to prepare, and the results are always great. Several times I have used just wings to serve at a party.  There have never been leftovers.

After getting tired of trying the regular store bought BBQ Sauce, I thought I would give it a try.  I wasn't sure how it would come out, but boy was I surprised.  The baked chicken was so juicy and had a rich flavor.  In short, it was excellant!

Made this tonight and hubby gave ut 5 stars.  I did not reduce the sauce as other reviewers suggested.  I cooked the chicken for an hour and 15 monutes and then let it sit outside the oven for 15 minutes until we were ready to eat. The sauce was not as thick as a barbeque sauce but has enough body to stick to the chicken when I spooned it over.  I also basted the chicken with the sauce 3 times while it cooked.

Very delicious and flavorful recipe. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts (4) and the recipe made quite a lot of sauce. I had to remove some of the sauce and cook on the stove with flour before it carmelized. I would make it again.

I won't make this again. Too much soy sauce for our tastes. The flavor of the meat was good, but we didn't like the sauce. It cooked much faster than the recipe indicated. We might have liked the flavor better if I'd pulled it out of the oven earlier.

I thought this was pretty tasty, but it didn't knock my socks off. It was very easy, though, and our company certainly ate it up. I recommend doing this in a pan that is EASY to clean, and periodically "basting" it so it doesn't get too dried out... you want the SAUCE to caramelize... not the chicken. :)

My fiance loved it and it is very rarely I am able to eat chicken legs, but I loved the flavor...it kinda tasted like chinese food. I made white rice and broccoli to go with it.

I taste tested the sauce before baking & it definitely needed the hot sauce others have recommended. I just sprinkled some in until I liked the flavor. NEVER CARAMELIZED THOUGH. I let the chicken bake for 45 minutes & broiled for a few, but it just didn't work. I also let it stand for a few minutes like someone else said-no luck & chicken got tough. Great flavor though.

It's a keeper.  I used chicken legs and drummies and it turned out great.  The whole family loved it.

We all loved this recipe, especially the kids.  However, I would be careful not to bake the chicken for the hour it suggests.  Too well done and dry.  But when it's moist and baked with the right amount of time it's WONDERFUL. Also, using chicken breasts  is a good option.

This recipe is great!  I used chicken breasts, turned the chicken over halfway through cooking and spooned the sauce over chicken again.  I also broiled the chicken (turning a couple times) for a few minutes after cooking for an hour.  I had no problem getting the sauce to carmelize.

This is excellent!  It was very easy.  I made it with legs instead of wings, and it turned out wonderfully.  Halfway through cooking I turned the legs.

My husband and I did not like this recipe. It's a very strong taste - the kind where you make an awful face after the first bite. I think it's just way too much soy sauce. I wouldn't make this again.

this recipe came out watery,  it never really carmelized like the recipe said and I cooked it for 1 hour and 30 minutes.  The kids however,did not seem to care.  they ate it anyway.  but they did not ask for seconds.  my husband thought the recipe was okay.  The meat however did fall off the bone real nicely. and was tender. so I gave it 4 stars overall. I'll make again hopefully it will come out better.

SO DELICIOUS!!!  Flavorful, but not spicy.  I will make time and time again.  (Don't forget to cut the chicken wings though--recipe left that part out.)

I found that using chicken wings, the chicken was really fatty.  The sauce never carmeiolzed enough even after keeping it in the oven for over the time indicated on the recipe.

This recipe was good. Everyone liked the flavor but it never caramelized because I made it using a sugar substitute. I am forever cursed with my inability to have sugar! For those of you who can have sugar, enjoy this one!

It's not often I find a new chicken recipe that is really different AND excellent. I made this using hindquarters and instead of 1 cup of honey, I used 1/2 cup and then added 1/2 of an Asian sweet/hot sauce. Left out the salt because of the amount of soy sauce. 
My only complaint,and it is not really with the recipe, is that the carmelized sauce stuck so badly on one of the pans I used that I had to soak it overnight and still scrape and soak some more. The strange thing is that the teflon one stuck so badly, but the stainless steel didn't nearly as much, so I suggest using that if you have it.

I tried this and it was very good!  I added some grated onion and a spoonful of chinese hoisen sauce to the sauce for additional flavor.  A deliciously different twist than regular bbq chicken! FOR THOSE OF YOU WHOSE CHICKEN DID NOT CARMELIZE, DO NOT COVER THE CHICKEN WHEN YOU COOK IT, THAT WAY IT WILL CARMELIZE AND GET NICE AND BROWN.

This was pretty good.  I would probably marinate the chicken in the sauce next time for several hours before cooking.  Also, I think I needed to cook mine longer.  The sauce was thin.  I was expecting it to be thick and sticky.  Maybe I did something wrong.  I will try this again.

I made this recipe a second time last night and I was able to get a caramelized sauce.
I used a shallow baking pan instead of a dish.  I lined the bottom of the pan for easy clean up.
I also baste the wings occassionally.  The sauce caramelized after 45 min.  It was sticky and yummy.  
One word of caution, remove the wings from alluminum lining before it is cooled, it sticks.
I will make this again.

Chicken was quick and easy and very yummy.  I would leave the salt out as soy is already very salty and use half a cup of honey, instead of 1.  Also, for tangier wings, use a little more ketchup.

This is a GREAT recipe! It incorporates all my favorite tastes (sweet, tangy, sticky) into one dish! Tip: For optimum caramelization, baste and turn the chicken every so often during baking.  This exposes the sauce more evenly to the heat. Also make sure you have enough honey --- it's the ingredient that causes the dish to caramelize!

I made these with chicken thighs.  The flavor was ok - slightly too sweet for my tastes.  The sauce was runny, even though I used the changes recommended by the top reviewer to make it thicker.  HOWEVER, I then took the leftovers the next night, shredded the chicken, added corn starch to the sauce, added veggies and sauteed it and ate it over brown rice.  Delicious!  I would make this as a stir fry again next time, or try it with the wings, as thighs were too big and the flavor didn't seep into the meat.

Sauce burned in the oven and it was super watery, didn't caramelize at all. Will make with suggestions next time. Thought it would be fine as is but I was wrong.

I made this last night for the second time for company and it was delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was just as good as the last time I made it.  The chicken came out nice and juicy both times and the flavor was wonderful.  I made it with chicken legs and boneless thighs and both were yummy.  I will definitely make this again and again.

I think too much chicken fat dilutes the sauce we want to Caramelize...This is my second time making this recipe...learning from the first I rendered off a lot of the fat and juices...just peeked and "Yes" it's caramelizing

My go to recipe that is also great on ribs. I use bbq sauce instead of ketchup, cook sauce on stovetop first with 1 tsp corn starch until thick. You can kick this up a notch by generously adding a dry rub before you put in oven..broil on low for 
last two minutes to lock in flavor..absoutely delicious!

I used this recipe on Cornish Game Hens.  It was really good!  I’ll keep this recipe in my cooking rotation.  Instead of using regular honey, I used Orange blossom honey, it gave it a little tang.

This was really good! I followed some of the advise of other reviewers and first seasoned my chicken lightly.
I used bone in chicken drumsticks and thighs.
I then cooked the sauce in a small pan on the stove top and added 2 tbsp of cornstarch to thicken. 
I poured the sauce over the chicken and baked as directed.
I turned up the oven to 500 at the end for about 7 min to really get that caramelized sticky texture.
Next time I will try using boneless skinless chicken thighs or breast.
Thanks for this recipe!!!

I baked according to instructions, but used chicken thighs. I think next time, I'll marinate it for a while before baking, maybe add sesame seeds and steam some rice. It was a go for my family

I made this with chicken breasts following the previous reviewers suggestion of 3/4 c.  honey and 3/4 c. ketchup and it was ok. I mean it was easy to make and made for a decent and different recipe but honestly its not something I would serve to company, for just my family  yes but not company.

I followed some changes made by crankerchick but also added in some red pepper flakes, and at the end I took the chicken out of the sauce and broiled it on a cookie sheet until the skin was a little crisper! Overall HUGE hit in my house, my step son said the best wings he has ever had!

I used 3 pounds chicken wings, other than that all other ingredients were to the letter.  I cooked exactly an hour which thickened and increased the stickiness of the sauce perfectly.  The family loved these!  I am only giving 4 instead of 5 stars because of the fact that we are not prewarned in the recipe that liquid will be plentiful until it starts to thicken.  I was running scared when I checked to baste them the first 1/2 hr.

Followed directions and the sauce never really caramelized. I even basted a few times throughout the cooking to make sure it kept getting more sauce on it. But dang.... This is good sauce. Pretty much the same as another recipe I do except this has honey and no red pepper. But this is delicious and I poured the sauce over rice. Could've just drank it but my wife would've looked at me weird. 1 star off cause I didn't get the caramelization part, which could've been user error. Good job!

I love this recipe!  I did borrow tips from other reviewers.  

Heat the sauce on the stove and add 2 tablespoons of cornstarch.  I tweak the sauce recipe, adding less soy sauce, some water and a tiny bit of mustard.  I play with the sauce until I like the taste!  

Season the chicken wings before covering in sauce. I used a chicken rub.  

One thing that is so important is making sure the chicken is completely thawed and paper towel dried.  Too much moisture will make the sauce slide right off and then you’ll end up with a watery puddle of sauce.  

Let it bake for 20 minutes then baste with any fallen sauce.  Check back at 40 minutes and rebaste if needed, and do this again right before the hour mark.   

The result is super sticky wings that are absolutely delicious!

I used the recommendations others had posted about using chicken breasts, but mine came out dry and runny. Next time I will cut the cooking time and temperature to 350 for 20 min and add a little cornstarch to help thicken the sauce while it is reducing. I see potential in this recipe, so I may try it again.

This recipe is awesome! We used chicken drumsticks and had to modify the recipe slightly to account for having less chicken than the recipe calls for, ande did put the sauce on the stove to reduce for a little bit to thicken it, since it came out very thin, but it turned out amazingly. :)

Next time we're going to try skinless chicken, since the skin burned a little with the sauce on it. But that's no big deal since the skin comes off :p the chicken itself was cooked to perfection and the flavor of the sauce was outstanding!

I fixed the this  yesterday and fell in love.  I blended tips from reviewers and cooking experience  and my chicken carmelized beautifully.  And then the taste!  This was simple and delicious.

I made this recipe using boneless skinless chicken thighs and it worked super well.  The soy and honey make a wonderful combo and the sauce easily covers a side of rice. A great quick and easy recipe.

My family thought it was okay.  I had to cook the chicken way longer than the recipe said, in order to get it to caramelize.

I made it mostly the way the recipe instructed, except less honey ~ half a cup instead of one cup - one hour exactly @ 375. Too sticky! But delicious.  Also, I patted the wings dry with a paper towel, brined it in salt water for 30 minutes and I used a greased foil lined baking sheet (not a 9x12 pan). Maybe that was the difference between those whose did not turn out? I didn't even measure the ingredients except for the honey! And I left out the garlic, because I didn't want to bother with getting a cutting board and knife dirty. (How do I add a photo to my review?)

The flavor on this was great! I made it with chicken legs instead of wings. One issue I have had making this, as well as other similar recipes is that they say to bake it until the sauce is carmelized. Mine never carmelizes. I haven't added any extra liquid, in fact per the instruction of a chef I took a class from I did not even rinse the chicken first so there is no additional liquid at all, but still I end up with a very watery liquid in the pan after cooking. And that was after nearly 2 hours in the oven! Oven was thoroughly preheated, recipe was followed exactly. 

I ended up cooking down the liquid on the stove top for a while to thicken it a little, then pouring a small amount over it. Next time though I think I will cook it down longer and maybe add some corn starch to aid in thickening it to give it a much better glazed appearance.

Garnished with some chopped green onions and toasted sesame seeds as another reviewer did and it looked great! Went over well at a neighborhood get together. 

By the way, I was terrified I ruined the recipe by adding about 3/4 tsp of salt in addition to the soy, but that was just the right amount. I also added just a hint of ginger to it. Yum!!!

I did as merideth recommended because we only eat chicken breasts and it was fantastic. My two year old loved it, it was her first experience eating chicken. No complaints from hubby either. I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic and still worked well.

Did not really work for our family - we didn't care for the overall flavor.  We ended up calling it 'ugly chicken'.  However!  We chopped it up and used in fried rice.  yay!

Great recipe as is or change to your own liking. Really hard to go wrong with this recipe. I personally buy the boneless thighs on sale @ warehouse store for a couple bucks a lb.This recipe is enough sauce for over 5lbs of chicken. I like to cook the sauce as suggested by another reviewer  to thicken it and the last time I made it I threw in some spicy orange marmalade which really tasted spectacular. Have fun with this recipe, you can go sweeter, spicier, whatever you like and turn this recipe into quite a few recipe options.  This is definitely a keeper.

Sauce was really good! I added some cayenne, and it was still pretty sweet. I cooked the sauce on the stove first and added some cornstarch until I got a consistency I liked. I baked them at 400 for like 25 minutes and they were cooked perfectly. Use a disposable pan for easy clean up (sauce was really sticky and started to burn to the edges of my nonstick pan).

The sauce didn't caramelize, but my family liked it anyway. Next time I'll set some sauce aside and reduce it in a saucepan to drizzle over the cooked wings..

Excellent.....tried to thicken sauce on stove but wouldn't ....next time add cornstarch... Used Soy Sauce: 1/2 cup, Catsup 1/2 cup, Honey 1/2 cup, Garlic 3 cloves, Tabasco 1/2 tsp. I changed the amount ingredients ONLY because someone else did. Next time I think I will follow the directions and ONLY add cornstarch. Great recipe any way you do it. Thx. June 29 , 2019...I am still having issues , sauce is NOT thick at all. Used 10 pieces of fryers and basted/turned chx X 4....sh'd marinate first or skip this recipe.

I did this Merideth's way for chicken breasts and it was awesome...3/4 cup katsup, 3/4 cup honey, 1/2 cup soy, 3-4 cloves garlic, 1/2 teaspoon sriracha, cook the mixture on the stove top until boiling and reduce heat. Pour on top of chicken and bake at 350 for 35-40 minutes..

I would make it again. I followed a suggestion and boiled sauce with cornstarch to thicken. Next time I'd make it with rice. I used bone in thighs but chicken is so sticky, boneless would have been better.

I made this with wings, as opposed to the boneless breasts recommended by many. It was a hit with the kids. I did uncover the dish after an hour and broiled it for about seven minutes to get a crispy effect. I look forward to trying it again with some of the recommendations mentioned by others. Delicious.

Made it just like the recipe stated except I did make the sauce in a pan ahead of time and added to the chicken.  It was a little too sweet and not enough overall flavor.  I will make again but may add a bit of cayenne and a little less honey.

Great recipe. I used boneless, skinless chicken breast and cut them into half inch strips. After mixing the sauce I knew it needed something so I added 2 tablespoons of Sriracha sauce which gave it the perfect little kick.  Then I put the pan of chicken along with a few sweet potatoes lightly rubbed with olive oil and course ground sea salt on the pellet smoker grill at 400 for 1 hour. Heated up some sweet peas and dinner was served.

One of my favorite dishes and most requested for the holidays. I tweak the recipe slightly by adding melted butter and cayenne pepper.

I'm not the best of cooks and haven't figured out how to get the sauce to caramelize, but I've made it twice and it gets better each time. Whether the sauce caramelizes or not, the wings were fantastic! Definitely a keeper!!

This was a great recipe. I used the drumstick chicken wings (3 packs). I did cook the sauce on the stovetop and added a mix of cornstarch & water after the sauce started boil( note: only use 1 tbsp of olive oil) Cooked the sauce until it starts thicken and pour over wings. Cook 30 min covered turn, another 30 min. covered and 20 min. uncovered on foiled lined deep baking sheet. Honestly they were best wings I've ever had, better than any restaurant. My dad loved them and he is a wing pro.

I made this with the recommended changes to simmer the sauce and I wasn't too impressed! Maybe marinating them would help amp up the flavor!

I followed the other reviews and made the sauce on the stove and poured it over the chicken. I did broil the chicken and sauce for 3-5 minutes to further carmalize the sauce. This was a delicious dish and super easy to make !

I used chicken thighs, boneless and skinless just because I didn't have any wings. I used only 4 thighs and so I cut the sauce in half. Very good. My need to adjust time for cooking. The top of the chicken was a little tough so next time I will check it at 45 minutes. Will make again for sure.

I made this and my husband and I are disappointed.   The glaze  is way too watery and it really lacks flavor.   I will not make again.  I feel I have wasted all this chicken.

I made this with boneless skinless chicken thighs and it turned out so well my son ( a fairly picky eater) had to call me to tell me it was the best chicken he has ever eaten! And don't lose that recipe! As for all the sauce, I love it for over rice and some crisp Asian style veggies! Yum!

I made this with 8 chicken thighs (bone-in and skin on).  I used only one half of the sauce ingredients and the amount of sauce was perfect.  It does not get thick but there was the right amount and I did baste it a couple times while cooking.  The skin was very hard, so we just pulled it off but at least it kept the chicken very moist.  It was tasty and everyone enjoyed it.

I used a whole chicken splayed flat. The sauce never  caramelized into a sticky coating like I hoped.  But the taste was through the  whole chicken and it was extremely tender. It was a success

I did as other reviewers had suggested and boiled the liquid mixture before pouring it over chicken.  I also added 2 tbsp corn starch to thicken it up.  The texture was great and it did caramelize; however, I just didn't  care for the taste.  I could distinctly taste the soy and the honey.  I hoped for a more blended flavor.  I will try this again, but will not use as much soy.  Also, I will line the pan with  foil.  It was a real baked on mess to clean up.

I made it and liked it, but like other reviewers, the sauce did not caramelized.  I turned on the broiler for a few minutes, which solved the formalization problem!   I used chicken thighs, otherwise followed instructions to the letter.  The sauce was VERY GOOD and the chicken tender and flavorful.  I like sweet foods; my husband prefers non-sweet, so I may not make it again.

Turned out fantastic.  Although I tweaked it a little bit.  Added some Siracha, vinegar, lemon pepper seasoning.  And instead of using wings I used boneless skinless chicken breasts. 
It's fantastic especially with the added heat.

Sweet and tangy; kids loved it!  When they came out of the oven, the skin looked a bit soft so I spread them on a cookie sheet and broiled them a few minutes more.  The sauce (it makes a lot) I poured into a frying pan, boiled it, and added some corn-starch & water to thicken it.

The only change I made was to add 1 1/2 tsp cornstarch after it had cooked for 45 minutes and wasn't thickening as much as I would have liked.  I poured off the sauce into a saucepan, added the cornstarch mixed with about 1 tablespoon of water, cooked it on the stove for 3-4 minutes and then poured it over the chicken and returned it to the oven for another 20 minutes or so.  Served it over rice.  Both hubby and I loved it.  He said next time he would have me separate it into two dishes so he could add a little heat in the form of some red pepper flakes to his but had no problem eating it the way it was.  Have added it to the "keeper" recipe book.  I did use boneless breasts this time but will definitely use it for wings the next time we make them.

I had half a dozen chicken drumsticks taking up room in my freezer and cut the recipe in half to accommodate the smaller quantity.  I used our counter top toaster oven and made no changes to temperature or time.  Chicken was tender, flavorful and looked just like the photo.  We'll be making this again!

Delicious!!! We had seconds!!
I added garlic powder, which gave the sauce a less sweet taste, something I prefer. A cut up chicken pieces were used; I had a whole chicken.
Saved the sauce to do with more wings the next day.
The sauce was excellent on mashed potatoes.

Here's the thing they don't tell you: You have to BASTE the chicken with the sauce several times during the cooking process.  Then you will get the gorgeous dark color and tasty coating.  I also used boneless/skinless thighs instead of wings.  You actually get some meat that way.  (What is this obsession with wings anyway???) Also, I turned the heat up to 400* the last 10 minutes to increase caramelization.  So good! If you want to "kick it up a notch," add the zest and juice of an orange to the sauce.. and maybe a little more garlic.

I followed the instructions without first reading the comments. It came out good and the sauce was very tasty but was a tad watery. I'm going to add some cornstarch to thicken it. Next time I will try boiling sauce first on top of stove then adding it to chicken halfway.

I made this recipe exactly as written but halved it as I was using 3 small thighs.  It didn't caramelize at all.

I based my recipe on the slight modifications mentioned here...3/4 cup ketchup, 3/4 cup honey and 3 cloves of garlic.  My kids loved it but it was a little sweet for me.

Fantastic. I forgot to add a little cornstarch to the sauce while heating it the first time so the it didn't stick to the chicken. I took the sauce from the pan and added some cornstarch, reboiling it and pouring over the chicken almost as a dipping sauce. Still very good. To the guy that said it tasted like butt, me thinks his wife was mad at him and did it on purpose, her little inside joke she can laugh over and over again. ;)

This recipe is awesome! I followed the ingredients but I seasoned my meat with my favorite seasonings before adding the sauce mixture and added a lot more garlic than the recipe called for (I love garlic). Also, I used chicken legs. Midway through baking I based the chicken and let it remain in the oven for over an hour. Wow I love the way it caramelized!

I did use thighs instead of wings and this recipe was still very good.  The sauce was awfully runny, justifying my 4 star rating, but I served it with mashed potatoes and it was absolutely delicious!

It turned out more like a homemade bar-b-que chicken.  Which didn't really surprise me because I usually use ketchup for the base of my bar-b-que sauce.  I probably wouldn't let my husband make it again.

I made this recipe with chicken legs. It was delicious and super easy. When my fiance goes back for more I make to write it down. Would be great for a family dinner. Leftovers were great I stored them with some of the sauce kept it super moist and flavorful.

Made this three times this year. The only difference is I withhold the red pepper flakes & cook chicken for an hour each side. The recipe calls for an hour, but the chicken is never done in that time frame. Great change from traditional baked chicken.

I veered from the recipe and used the top reviewers suggestions because my husband prefers white meat chicken breasts. I gotta say...It. Was. Just. Awful. It tasted like chicken dipped and baked in ketchup and sugar. I have given this recipe 5 stars for now because it isn't cool to give a recipe a bad rating if it's been altered. Next time I'll try it with wings and not stray from the original recipe.

Loved it! I followed some of the suggestions and boiled the sauce for 5-10 minutes on the stove top to caramelize it. It was perfect!! I liked the 3/4 ratio of ketchup, honey, 1/2 cup of soy sauce( I used the lower salt version) and two tbsps olive oil. I added seasoning to the sauce before boiling. Baked the chicken 30-40 minutes. I did cover it with foil for the first 15 then kept basting it there after. My family loved it. Will definitely be making this dish again!!!!

This dish came out great and my family loved it. I did cook the sauce on top of the stove for 15 minutes and thickened it with cornstarch as others suggested. I also seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, ginger, onion powder and a tiny bit of Lawry's seasoning salt. Since this recipe has soy sauce which is pretty salty I used very little of the seasoning salt. I baked for 1 hour covered and then 15 minutes uncovered. The chicken carmalized beautifully.

I made this based on the recipe changes in the helpful reviews listed below it (3/4 c ketchup, 3/4 c. honey, 1/2 c. soy mixed together and cooked on the stovetop first ) and it was FANTASTIC! I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and they were perfectly done in about 40 minutes so you can use any pieces of chicken, just adjust the cooking time. I am saving this recipe for my next party or the next time I have to bring a potluck dish because it is SO EASY and delicious! It is very rare for me to find a dish that everyone in my house loves especially the picky kiddos but this passed the test! I served it with smashed potatoes and steamed green beans. Yum!

I really didn't like this recipe.  I tried it twice.  Once with wings and once with drumsticks.  Both times, there was too much liquid in the pan from the chicken to allow the sauce to caramelize.  My wife is a Vegan so I made this same recipe with deep fried tofu and it was delicious so I think the sauce is good. I just don't think it is thick enough to caramelize in chicken grease.

I've done this multiple times mostly using bone-in chicken breasts and. We love this. Recently I've started to brine the chicken first which greatly enhanced the flavor.

Followed recipe exactly the first few times I made it and then slowly reduced the amount of honey and kids still love it!  Tastes so much like the Chinese BBQ wings we get in Chinatown.

DELICIOUS. I wasn't able to get the sauce thick enough - it turned out a bit soupy. But the taste was exactly what we were hoping for!

I followed the recipe but used chicken thighs and I would give this sauce 10 stars!  Definitely will continue to use this sauce and would recommend trying it.

Don't change a thing.  I made this for dinner this week using 4 good sized boneless chicken breasts and it was fantastic!  I got rave reviews from my daugther and her boyfriend.

Instead of chicken wings I used chicken breasts, cooked the chicken a bit too long so it did dry out a bit but that was my fault. Regardless it was still super good, boyfriend loved it. Also added hot sauce and sweet chili sauce to give it an extra kick.

The sauce was a little thin. I think I will add brown sugar next time to thicken it up. Maybe even coat the wings in some flour first too.  I did add some siracha and red pepper flakes this time around to give it a little zing! So Delish.

Followed the recipe and it didn't carmelize or get sticky which I wanted.  Chicken taste was good but it's not what I expected.  I should have followed some of the recommendations that were posted.  Don't think I'll make it again.

This was delicious!  And I don't even like chicken wings! lol.  I used skinless chicken wings and sauted them in a skillet on stove top first to cook, then followed the recipe.

This sauce did not caramelize until I had to over cook the chicken, making it a little dry. I did cook the sauce on the stove top for about 15-20 minutes to thicken it too, before covering the chicken and baking it. The flavor was very good, but the sauce wasn't the consistency I was hoping for. If I do it again I will try adding the corn starch others have mentioned. I also made this with breasts and thighs, and by far the thighs were the better choice in cut.

The sauce did not render down to the thick consistency as shown on the video and photograph. I replaced one tablespoon of catsup with 1 tablespoon of Siracha.  Even more tangy flavor and not spicy.  I like the addition of  roasted sesame seeds and chopped scallions sprinkled on the chicken.  Great touch.

made this the other night and the family enjoyed it. very easy to make. I cooked the sauce in a pan on top of the stove to  start to thicken while the chicken was starting to cook in the oven. Then poured it on the chicken when it cooked for a few minutes.  It never truly thickened until I was cleaning up and everything was completely cooled.. The sauce was very thick then. So here is my idea on why the sauce stays  thin when hot - when the honey is hot/warm it is very liquid - when it cools down it thickens, thus a thick sauce. don't let this stop you from trying.

Made it...very good, sweet and savoury.   A few modifications and I used chicken legs with backs instead of wings.   Took previous review suggestions to boil and reduce sauce before pouring over meat.  Made changes to the sauce, instead...used 1/2 cup ketchup, 3/4 honey, doubled garlic, added tsp Thai Chili sauce for bit of heat and teaspoon of lemon juice for bit of tang to cut the sweetness.  I had other stuff in 400f oven so I added it to cook uncovered for 40 minutes.  Basted it every 15 minutes and at end, let rest about 10 minutes.  Chicken was very tender and flavourful.  Sauce was excellent over steamed rice.  Will definitely do this again.

Truly fantastic. Used it for wings and found it to be sticky, yummy, and very easy. The only change I made was substituting in some coconut sugar because I ran out of honey. Tasty!

just looking for a sweet chicken recipe and came across this. I sometimes like to make changes to recipes just to experiment. I used chicken thighs and season them with a little season salt and lemon pepper. Instead of honey I used cup of brown sugar because I had no honey on hand, added cayenne pepper because I like spicy, also used canola oil because had no olive oil. Turn out very good.

FAST EASY.  To prepare. I followed  review about
boiling on top, of stove then baking . Worked well. I am going to take this tip to other things when you want sauce to stick.
Make again.

First off let me clear up that this recipe is from 365 ways to cook chicken and it is the best chicken cookbook ever! 2nd....Sprinkle the wings liberally with pepper, split the wings and don't overlap the chicken when laying in the pan. If you increase the amount of ketchup and garlic and cooked until bubbly and brown, the wings fall off the bone and taste delicious!  I have made this recipe for at least 20 years! I also baste with a turkey baster while cooking.

This was really good. Used drumsticks for the kids and followed the first reviewed recommendation regarding quantity and making sauce on stovetop to thicken. Then asked about 25-30 mins at 350. Served with mushroom rice. Kid approved ):

Followed the recipe and this was delicious! 6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  I did add a 1/2 teaspoon of balsamic vinegar, 3/4 c ketchup 3/4 c honey, 1/2 cup soy sauce. Bake at 350 for 40 mins.

Just a tad too sweet. I enjoyed it much more than my husband--- who couldn't even bring himself to finish it. I am not sure if I would make again... but if I ever did, I'd certainly cut back heavily on the ketchup & honey. Mine also didn't caramelize at all. Over all, I'd day this recipe missed the mark.

This is a good an easy recipe, I have follow the instruction with some changes over the amount of ingredients as I've seen people commenting on how sweet or sour the sauce turns out to be. The taste of the sauce itself turns out okay, but when I tried to bake it in the oven, the sauce did not caramelized at all and instead it doubled the amount and become very watery. I don't usually have a first try gone wrong, but I'm going to remake this recipe sometime later to check what is really wrong

It turned out really good! The only thing I did differently is I used chicken breasts as well as wings and the sauce stuck the the breast better, adding more flavor. A great recipe though!

I used the sauce on boneless, skinless chicken breasts.   I added 2 additional cloves of garlic and a splash more light sodium soy sauce.    Very tasty.

Followed the recipe, except instead of 2 tbs of olive oil, I did 1 of olive oil and 1 of Wok Oil (a garlic oil.) Also, I used huckleberry honey instead of regular. It was amazing!

I made it using 1/4  cup soy sauce (because I'm not a soy sauce fan) and 1/2 cup more honey, and an extra 1/2 tablespoon of  ketchup.  I like a sweeter taste. The flavor was great and my chicken did caramelize.

I made this following the directions exactly and it didn't even come close to the picture. My sauce never thickened up leaving my chicken looking strange. Also, the flavor of the sauce was less than favorable.

I used grapeseed oil instead of olive oil and used around 6 cloves of minced garlic, but otherwise I kept to the original recipe. My wife and the rest of my family loved it. Serve over rice with vegetables on the side and you have a quick and easy dinner. Bon Appetit.

Good basic recipe, though did I tweak it to my own taste. I only added half a cup of honey, 1 tbs of oil and added a nub of grated ginger. Simmered it on the stovetop for 10 minutes and voila. Great sauce (though next time I won't add any oil). Served this with white rice and broccoli. (picture above)

Delicious, I did just chicken legs, added garlic salt to the recipe and half way through baking them I took them out of the oven to change them sides and coat them again.

I did make it, and it was good, but it didn't caramelize and I followed the recipe exactly.  I put it in longer and it still didn't caramelize.  However, it did taste good, and everyone liked it.  Maybe I'll try again with convection.

A great recipe to play around with! I've made it once exactly as written (no idea why some people have had an issue with it caramelising, mine worked out fine)and the second time, as I was cooking for a diabetic uncle, I used half the amount of honey and reduced the sauce with a handful of chopped spring onions at the end and served with rice, Chinese-style. Wonderful both times, thanks to Sandy for posting!

Doubled the garlic and then split the sauce. Was actually beautiful to cook in the sauce and then toss the cooked wings in a few more scoops of the sauce. Used an herbed goat cheese to serve with. Loved and will be putting in the recipe box.

This recipe was okay. Sauce tasted much better before baking in my oppenion. I baked the chicken wings till they were burning  places and falling off the bone done and the sauce still wasn't carmalized so I had to pour the sauce into a saucepan and cook it till it carmalized and pour it over the chicken. I saved the recipe and Iight make it again
 Not sure.

good with changes... 1.) season chicken, but watch the salt since the sauce has soy sauce 2.) add 2 tbsp cornstarch and boil sauce on stovetop until thick 3.) cover chicken and cook 45 mins @ 375 4.) uncover and cook for 15 more mins

This dish was amazing. It was excellent and tasty, the chicken was tender and not dry at all. We served it over a bed of rice. I give this 5 stars.

That being said, I can never make this dish again. My husband had a violent reaction to the amount of honey it had in it - apparently he's allergic to honey! We had no idea! I didn't rate it down because it was delicious and the poster has nothing to do with my husband's freak allergy. It was tasty while it lasted though. My husband wanted to make sure I wrote that he really enjoyed the meal (until he reacted to it, of course). ;)

I read some of the reviews before I did this, and many people were changing the recipe, personally I don't think it needs any changing.  My family loved it the it was the only thing I did was add 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper to make it spicy like the video. This is a great way to make a boring dinner like chicken exciting.

I didn't have soy sauce so substituted with a Weber Sesame and Ginger Marinade packet mixed with 1/2 cup of orange juice. This is delicious!

I sprinkled garlic salt on the drumstick chicken before pouring the mixture.  The mixture I did as stated on the recipe.  Covered and baked it for an hour (turned the chicken after 1/2 hour) then broiled in low for 10 minutes, 5 minutes on each side  They turned out awesome!  The whole family loved it...even my daughters friend who's a picky eater =). I made a whole tray so we can have some left over for dinner but they ate it all quick!  Thank you for this recipe!

I did this with breast and followed the instructions from the very first reviewer.  Came out very good!  Will do again and next time, I think I will add bacon on top of the glaze.

yummy as is, but definitely want to try some of the other suggestions to make sauce thicker.  This recipe is a keeper with some tweaking.

The sauce didn't thicken as quickly as the directions stated so I had the wings in for about 90 mins instead but the chicken was still fall off bone moist and delicious. My friends said it was the best chicken I'm ever made!

Family loved it.  I used the version for boneless breasts posted in one of the reviews. I added sesame seeds on top and my daughter thought it tasted like a better/fresher version of Chinese Sesame chicken.  The sauce was a little thin -- someone mentioned adding cornstarch while cooking sauce on stove.  I think I will try that next time.   Flavor was great -- I might turn up the Tobasco a bit.  It's a keeper.

Excellent!!  I cooked it as another suggested by boiling the sauce first on the stove adding 2 tbsp of corn starch, cooked covered for no less than 45 minutes and 15 uncovered.  I thought the sauce was going to be too thin but it really thickened up during that last 15 minutes.  I ended up with a bunch of sauce,  maybe double more than needed for 3 lbs.   Really good!! :)

Made this with boneless skinless breast fillets. I also did not have enough honey. Used molasses and everything turned out great. Followed advice of others and cooked the sauce to a boil. I poured it over the fillets after I cut them up into bite size pieces. I baked at 400 degrees first. I then lowered to 385 degrees. Got the color I wanted and the taste. I can see adding orange zest and a little brown sugar. I did use a little brown sugar Truvia. This is a keeper. I took a close up so you could see how brown the chicken was right out of the oven.

This recipe is sweet and sticky and tasty, as promised.  My husband loved it, but for me it was just a bit too sweet.  Still, it was easy to make and we had no trouble devouring the entire batch.

I followed one of the recommendations to boil the sauce separate with some corn starch to thicken and it worked great. Super easy and super tasty dish my whole family loved! I used skinless chicken breast tenderloin.

Very tasty with easy recipe.  Had all ingredients on hand. I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of honey, along with 2 tbls red pepper.  Also, I added 1Tbls of  flour to mixture as suggested and boiled on stove all ingredients 10 minutes.  Poured ingredients onto boneless,  skinless thighs and baked uncovered for 45 minutes.  Really good. Adding flour and boiling on stove top was key (I think) to having thicker glaze. Will share recipe and definitely cook again.

Followed recipe exactly and it was good. I will add a little more crushed red pepper next time and pop it under the broiler at the end for crispness.

I used boneless, skinless chicken breast. The sauce did caramelize for me without cooking it on the stove top, but with 2 tbsp. potato starch (that is what I have, but corn starch should work just as well). As suggested by others, I baked the chicken in the over at 400F until almost done (maybe 20-30 min.), then poured the sauce on it and placed back in the oven. In about 10 min. the sauce had thickened. I mixed the chicken to coat it well and placed back for maybe 5 min. It is delicious and much better than a store bought sauce.

I made this last night it was ok the chicken was moist I made the sauce on the stove top and glazed wings every 15 minutes it was nothing special just dinner if you know what I mean. I would rather experiment  with a new recipe than relive this one. It doesn't mean it's not a great dish just not for me. Everyone likes different tastes you can't  find that great dish if you don't try.

I used thighs instead of wings because that's what I had, but it was still close to 3 lbs.  I was also a touch short (maybe a T each) on soy sauce and honey and forgot the garlic.  That being said:  I will not make this recipe again.  It DID smell bad cooking (I had to turn on the fan) and it didn't caramelize at all. I even raised the temp near the end hoping the extra heat would help.  This recipe might be okay for marinade; and, I would use a baking sheet or use a rack.  13x9 seems a little crowded for 3 lbs.

Loved it do to the ease of the recipe and you could literally make this on a day where you don't have time to grocery shop due to the light ingredient list. I added spicy brown mustard though, whole family loved it.

I tried this recipe tonight & it is definitely a keeper.  I did one chicken breast so don't think I have it correct yet but I will get it there.  Sometimes Chicken breasts are so dry & this definitely make it moister & better tasting.

This recipe wasn't for me. The sauce was not complex enough. It tasted like salt and sugar, but no other levels to it. My husband, 6-year old and 4-year old all said it was ok, but the kids only ate two bites before moving on to the broccoli.

OMG, so good!!  Never tried it before today, but I am so glad I did.  I only had 2# of chicken wings, but I made the whole & complete recipe for sauce.  Then, drained off about a cup during the baking process.  This turned out to be perfect!  Totally awesome.  I would make this again.

This was good, as all chicken wings are, but not great. I made scaled the recipe down to 2lbs of chicken wings, but otherwise made it according to directions. It never did caramelize for me or turn thick. It had a good flavor very similar to teriyaki actually so am thinking I could just skip some steps and buy teriyaki marinade.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers so that I could get a thicker, glazed sauce. It did not work at all. The flavors were very tasty, but the chicken came out of the oven in a watery sauce. I followed other reviewers suggestions to the letter. Overall, it tasted good, but not what I was looking for in a sticky, tangy sauce. May be it was because it was used on chicken? this might be better using a salmon or some kind of fish.

Delicious! I love this. I did have to make 2 small changes. I only had a 1/2 cup of honey so I added 1/4 cup of brown sugar. Also my oven doesn't seem to work at 375 so I baked this at 400. Absolutely delicious my boyfriend loved it.

it was just so so...i made it w/4 whole chicken breasts, cut each breast into 2. I followed the advise of other users and made sauce on stovetop, I used 2 tbs cornstarch and 2 tsp of brown sugar i let boil it came up nice and thick. I placed the oven to 400 baked and glazed over on the 10min mark  baked another 15min and broiled for 3min. Was just ok, maybe would be better on chicken wings or on the grill,of letting it marinade overnight.

This didn't work for me. The sauce eventually caramelized, and then burned. Honey Baked Chicken II (on this site) is a similar and much better recipe.

I tried this recipe and its great! Simple ingredients with bold flavor. I cut the recipe in half because its was just for 2 people and it came out wonderful. Great for a potluck, appetizer, or main dish.

Made the original recipe.. cooked it for about 25min then poured the sauce from the pan into a pan on the stove. Added a table spoon of bisquick and boiled it for five minutes. Added it back to my chicken cooked it for 15min and it is the best!

Made this with boneless chicken and it still turned out great. A little runny on the sauce so i might up the ketchup or honey next time. Either way, great flavor!

I reduced the sauce for around 30 minutes, on the stove, to thicken it up. Cooked this recipe, side by side in the oven with store bought BBQ sauce, without reduction, over wings. The recipe sauce  blackened & tasted like chinese hoisin sauce... which is fine if I want asian wings. We preferred store bought sauce over the wings, easier and tastier.

I used this recipe as a glaze for boneless skinless chicken. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and cooked the sauce on the stove with a little cornstarch. I also added hot sauce. I then coated the chicken and baked on 375 for 30 minutes. I would recommend going for 40 minutes next time, covering for the last 15 or so because my glaze did start to burn.

Prepped this for an appetizer & everyone wanted the recipe.  The only change I made was I used several cloves of garlic instead of just one.  Just a personal preference.

This is a good easy weeknight supper with some rice and veg. It is delicious, but be careful not to let "caramelized" turn into "burned". It's a fine line!

Made for my boyfriend and his group of friends for the first time... followed the recipe to a T using chicken breasts and thighs instead and it turned out AMAZING!!! Received so many compliments on the taste and tenderness of the chicken. In fact, I was told I could out sell any chinese restaurant.

These were really good.  However, the way the recipe is written, the sauce didn't caramelize.  I baked it for almost two hours and nothing.  But they tasted great.  I just strained the sauce from the pan and served it as a dipping sauce on the side and everyone loved them.  Next time, I think I will thicken the sauce up on the stove first.

I'm a lazy cook, so I don't really measure ingredients for recipes like this, but I went easy on the honey and soy, didn't add salt, and used a package of chicken legs. Lined the pan with foil- sprayed with canola oil, and turned chicken twice during cooking, swirling it around in the sauce. Also added red pepper flakes and tabasco and used garlic olive oil and confit garlic (leftover from flavoring the olive oil) instead of fresh garlic. It came out nice and sticky, spicy and sweet! Make sure your sides are done when the chicken comes out, or you'll be tempted to scarf it down beforehand- like I did! Leave the skin on, as others have said (not my normal thing). Took just over an hour. Have also made this with thighs.

Absolutely delish!!! Took the suggestion of   boiling it first.  I cut back on  the honey which resulted in less "stickiness" but putting it in the broiler for 7 mins was a nice move.  A keeper recipe for sure

It was very tasty and the only reason it didn't get a full 5 stars was because it was missing a little something. To really make it I added some red pepper flakes (or you could add cayenne pepper) to give it some heat with the sweet. I used chicken thighs and totally forgot to cut the amount of sauce down so after we cooked the chicken we put the left-over sauce in a pot on the stove (added some pepper flakes) and thickened it, delicious!

This recipe turned out great.  I followed other reviewers who modified the amounts for boneless, skinless chicken breasts, and it turned out perfect.  I made 4 large chicken breasts and there was so much sauce, I only used a little more than half, and at first thought I should have cut in half, but the portion that I reserved and had not used on the chicken, I ended up using on leftover pork tenderloin and that was also a fantastic use for the sauce.

This chicken was delish. I followed the directions to a T except that I used minced garlic as I did not mince my own which meant my measurement may have been a bit off, I used light soy sauce and I used 2.16 lbs off chicken wings instead of 3lbs. I'm sitting here eating leftovers for lunch and I admit it tastes much better today but it was awesome last night as well. Lastly I was so worried that it'd taste like soy sauce but it didn't at all.

I used skin on wings, but when the chicken was done the sauce was REALLY watery. So I took some out and simmered it in a small pot with a little cornstarch in it. It thickened it up, but then the flavor was just okay. I'll probably try it again, but modify the sauce.

I made these wings last night and I followed the recipe exactly as it is on here. The sauce didn't caramelize even after leaving it for half an hour more. The sauce was too watery. Also my husband said the soy sauce taste was overwhelming. I personally thought they were average! I might make these again but I will try and modify it so the chicken can actually caramelize.

The sauce was good but I was hoping for more flavor in the actual chicken itself. I will not be making this again.

My boyfriend and I made this but instead of baking the chicken with the sauce, I caramelized the sauce in a pan and my boyfriend grilled the chicken and tossed it in the sauce when it was done. We also used it on steak and i liked it better that way actually. I added a little crushed red pepper and chipotle pepper to the sauce. It was perfect.

In the words of my picky daughter "AWESOOOOOME"! I boiled ingredients before pouring it over chicken as the 1st commenter stated.  I did not reduce it alot only because I wanted to have a sauce to put over my rice.  Will definently make this again and again. Thanks for the recipe!

I make my own BBQ sauce so used that instead, and cooked mine only for 50 min and they were awesome, for those that are looking to thicken the sauce - try some molasses it will sweeten it up as well.

This is very yummy! I used skinless boneless chicken breast pieces instead of wings.  It would have been better with a thicker sauce, so next time I will definitely try meredith's suggestion to cook the sauce on the stovetop first.

I am giving this 5 stars even though I didn't have all the ingredients so I had to improvise a little, but I still think it was super delicious and will make it again for sure. Used on chicken breasts cooked at 375 for 40 minutes came out great

This was gooey, sticky and totally awesome.  A great way to do wings without having to marinate for hours.  It's always nice to have options at the last second.  This is a keeper!

Liked it, a lot. Didn't LOVE it, but liked it very much. Thought it would be a tad sweeter. And maybe a tad tangier with the ketchup. So, it was good, not great. Cooked up nicely for sure, I usually bake my chicken this way, to come out sticky and crispy but super moist inside. Thanks for the recipe! Will attempt to tweek it to my taste.

It turned out perfect! I didn't have any cornstarch so I use flour to thicken up the sauce and I did turn my chicken once during baking, just to make sure both side were caramelized.

These didn't really caramelize for me and I tried the recommendation from some of the Most Helpful reviews.  I also didn't really care for the taste but that is just my personal preference.  It was a little too sweet for me.

I used the sauce on chicken breasts and it turned out very well.  It didn't really caramelize, but that may be because there wasn't any skin on the chicken.  The chicken turned out moist and flavorful.

Very tasty sauce.  Used chicken breast and baked in the oven, then thickened the sauce afterwards with cornstarch.  I seasoned the chicken first with adobo sauce, and I think that made it a tad bit too salty, so I won't do that that again.  It was really tasty as leftovers the next day served over white rice with asparagus, it almost had an asian vibe.

Loved it!! My husband doesn't like baked chicken as he says it's too slimy but he ate his words and the chicken!! This will be in the rotation! Oh yeah I added brown sugar and next time I will add a little hot sauce or chili powder for a kick.

Very tasty but I had to drain the liquid off twice while baking and I had to mix another quick batch of the sauce to coat the chicken a second time.  It was worth it because it was delicious.  I did add some brown sugar to the recipe which gave it a sweeter taste.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!  Made this for a football pregame dinner and served 55 starving players.  I used legs and thighs and followed the recipe as is. It got rave reviews and will now become a regular chicken dish for my family and when serving crowd size meals.

I loved this dish. The only change I made was boiling the sauce b4 pouring it over the chicken. It came out so delicious. My family wanted kfc and they said they would rather have this any night.

I tried this with a few alterations and it came out delicious! I was mixing the ingredients when I realized I didn't have any honey. Having to improvised, I used some pancake syrup. I also used lower sodium soy sauce, and I didn't have enough of that either so I added some apple/cranberry juice.  I used quarter chicken instead of chicken wings. The coating was wonderful, tasted almost like I bar-b-qued it on a grill rather then baked it in my oven. I wouldn't advise anyone to use the apple/cranberry juice as it dulled the taste of the soy sauce a little (maybe pure cranberry juice would have been better), but other then that it was very good!Even with all the alterations.

I made the sauce on the stovetop, heating until the sauce thickened. Poured the sauce over boneless chicken breasts and baked them. Very good sauce that will probably work with pork just as well.

Good but not fantastic.  Recipe was "missing" something. Per other reviews boiled first with cornstarch to thicken.  Will not make 2nd time.

Mine didn't caramelize, but the flavor was great. Good to stir things up away from the boring old baked chicken recipes that I normally stick to. -- UPDATE: my boyfriend now requests this chicken recipe on a weekly basis. we love it. thanks!

I LOVE this recipe! :) I use the mix as a marinade for chicken wings... add a couple extra cloves of garlic and marinate overnight. The following day, I lay the wings out on a metal tray and drizzle some sauce over each wing (i don't use all the sauce). This turns out great every time!

We made this exactly as written except we baked them in our smoker to give them a bit of that awesome smoky flavor. We brought the sauce to a boil then turned off the heat. The sauce didn't thicken up very much but we basted the chicken often and it glazed the chicken very well.

This was great! I ran out of honey since I had 4.5 lbs of wings - so halfway through cooking I brushed on some honey bbq sauce. They were scarfed down! Thanks for the great recipe! :)

I had high hopes after the reviews, but found this really quite yucky. Despite the caramelization, it tasted like ketchup.

Oh mann...this chicken was all that and more!! My kids (6 & 8) are not really meat eaters, but when they tried this chicken they actually asked for more. I was suprised and and so was my husband. He was even more excited to see the kids eating and asking for seconds. Thanks to whomever made this recipe....you own this!!!

I didn't think the sauce would carmelize in the oven so I boiled it on the stove with some cornstarch.  It got thick but still not "gooey".  I used drumsticks and basted the chicken every 10 minutes.  I also thought the sauce tasted a little off so I added a tablespoon of bbq sauce and a tbsp of teriyaki sauce as well.  I was still thinking the sauce wasn't very good.  Until the chicken was completely done and the sauce did carmelize at the end.  It ended up delicious!  So, 4 stars for having to make so many changes, but it was a good start.

This is a wonderful sauce!!  My family loved it.  We just use the recipe for the sauce with whatever chicken we have (usually breasts) and change the cook time according to what chicken we're using.

This was DELICIOUS!!! I used sesame oil instead of olive for more of an asian flare and threw in diced green onion. It didn't caramelize and I had to take it out because the chicken was cooked. And maybe it didn't because of the different oil but I am so glad it didn't because we were able to smother our rice with it. The sauce was drinkable. Seriously!

My family and I really are enjoying this recipe. As I rate we are eating it. Just couldn't wait to share :). I followed the recipe exactly as it is but added a layer of mushrooms in the pan before adding the chicken and sauce, and using drumsticks instead of wings. I then thicken the sauce with a cornstarch mixture and paired the chicken with garlic, rosemary mash potato and mixed vegetables.  Can you say DELICIOUS!!?

Great!  Used b/s chicken breast and boiled 1-to-1 honey/ketchup/soy sauce on the stove with a few cloves sliced garlic. Used ovenproof pot on the stove and just put the chicken right in there before transferring to the oven at 200 C for 35 min.

This was easy and so yummy!  I didn't have as much honey on hand as I thought so it wasn't as gooey as it should have been, but the flavor was great!  I also didn't use chicken wings.  I had some legs and breasts that I had in the freezer left over from chicken and dumplings and fried chicken.   I will make this again

The only thing I changed with this recipe was that I used boneles skinless chicken breast cut into tenders. My sauce did not caramelize. I even cooked it on the stove top and broiled it the last 10 mins. The flavor of the chicken was magnificent though.

Something just did not go right for me with this. I used everything according to the recipe except I do not like soy sauce so I used teriyaki sauce. I also used chicken breast which may have been the problem. The "sauce" thats supossed to be sticky on the chicken was just watery in the dish. I tried adding more sugar to thicken it, but just made it too sweet for me. I couldn't get the chicken to brown in all the water sauce.  My fiance LOVED it though. He wants me to make it again. So next time I will try cooking the chicken on the stove first to remove water. I loved the flavor of it, and it went amazing with quinoa and zuchinni.   Will try again, hopefully with better luck!

Sorry,we did not like this one. I used a whole chicken cut up. I added the 2 Tbsp. cornstarch to the sauce and boiled it on the stove before I poured it over the chicken. I thought there was WAY too much sauce.  We did not care for it.  The sauce did carmelize however.

I love this recipe. I made a couple small changes to it that really seemed to work. I cooked it for 20 minutes and then turned the chicken over. After another 20 minutes I pulled the chicken and finished it on the BBQ for 3-4 minutes on each side. As well, I reserved about 1/4 of the sauce, reduced it stove top and made that into a basting sauce for the BBQ. Fantastic. Did it for a wings competition amongst friends and received positive compliments on it.

Yum!! Decided to marinate chicken in the sauce for an hour ahead of time, then baked chicken legs for one hour, came out beautifully and tasted great! I used only 5 chicken drumsticks, so I halved the recipe and I had enough to marinate in and spare left over.

I've made this many, many times over the last several years - usually as a marinade of sorts for chicken breasts.  Everyone ALWAYS raves at its flavor.  Quick, easy and a definite crowd pleaser!

Just had a wing contest at our church and this recipe won me a terrific chicken trophy!!! Made it mostly as directed, only adding more garlic to the initial sauce and turned the mings every 15 minutes during the baking time.  Excellent!

I made chicken wings, following a suggestion to bake covered for 45 minutes and uncovered for 15. I found that doing the last portion with the convection fan turned on really helped the final step. The good news is this was really delicious. The bad news is that, despite two layers of foil, the sauce still penetrated and I spent an hour chiseling it out. This was a mess to make, and I don't know if I'll do it again.

I made this recipe with boned and skinned chicken breast halves, and it carmelized just fine as it was written.  I made sure that the chicken fit into the baking pan snugly so that the sauce was deep enough to almost cover all the chicken.  I also turned the chicken once during cooking.

I was very surprised at how much I liked these.  My 6 year old (who was a little disgusted when he saw me using honey) devoured them.  I made the recipe as directed and it was so sweet and sticky.   Towards the end of cooking I flipped them around a few times in the pan a few times and spooned more of the sauce on them so it could really get baked in.  So good

My family and I LOVE the sauce and make the sauce all the time, just to have on hand. It has a semi-teriyaki flavor. I add about 3/4 cup of cool cornstarch water (3 rounded tbsp of cornstarch about) and let it boil again to thicken it. When it heats up or bakes it thins out a lot (even when thickened), so the whole recipe was good, but not very flavorful since the sauce thinned out so much. When using the sauce, I usually add it last to get the full rich flavor, instead of heating it with the food. This recipe goes great with rice too!

This chicken was awesome!  I made it for Sunday dinner and loved it so much, I made it for Sunday dinner the next week.  Unfortunately, I ran out of soy sauce from the first time and used thick soy sauce as a substitute.  I would definitely recommend NOT doing that, as the molasses overtook all other flavors. It was still pretty good though.  I think that the recipe is perfect as is. I could taste a little garlic which blended well with the other flavors.  Also, I'm not a big fan of skin on chicken, but I do like the flavor it gives, so I used chicken drumsticks, and peeled the skin off before I ate it. Delicious!

I made this for a dinner party.  I would have only given this 4 stars but everyone else LOVED this recipe.  I don't think I am a fan of burnt honey.  Next time I will try it with brown sugar instead.  I did thicken the sauce like other reviews suggested.

This was good but I wouldn't call it caramelized at all.  The sauce was very runny.  If I cook it again I would boil the sauce first like some suggested to see if that works.

The glaze is actually really good, but not over chicken with skin on it--I don't like soggy skin.  Next time I'll use it on boneless skinless breasts.

I wasn't crazy about this recipe. I wanted to use up some boneless chicken breast so I put the sauce in a sauce pan and cooked it in hopes of having a thicker sauce and then just poured it over the breasts and baked.  The sauce just never thickened.

I made this recipe exactly as directed and the wings didn't really carmelize, they just sat in their juice.  The flavor was good, but next time I think I will take them out and broil them for a few minutes to get that carmelization.

Wowee what a great meal! This goes really well with some white rice and broccoli. A few suggestions for baking that some may have made before. Boil the sauce and simmer before pouring on the chicken. Baste every 15 minutes or so because the sauce will be a little runny at first. Make sure to turn the chicken. The first time i made this the top of mine burnt because I didn't turn it, so I scraped that off and it was so delicious!!!! Favorite baked chicken recipe I have done after all of the tweaks.

I used chicken tenders.  We all liked the flavor.  I will try some of the tips next time to try for more stickiness.

This made way too much sauce for the chicken.  The leftovers were awful and I had to throw them away.  I will not be making this again!

Added cornstarch and boiled in microwave for a few minutes. Covered with foil 30 min. then uncovered, turned chicken and cooked another 20+ min. Shredded it before serving over rice.

I failed to read the reviews before my attempt at this recipe, so my chicken came out watery :( In order to save it, I put it on the stove top on high heat and added some cornstarch and it lived! I will definitely keep this recipe and make it again because the taste was very good. I'll be tweaking it to my flavor and make sure to have it caramelize correctly next time!!

I was hoping that I would really like this because I love wings but I like my wings to be crispy.  The sauce did not caramelize.  I used frozen chicken wings so that may be why.

I made this with drumsticks instead on wings because it's what I had on hand.  Felt like a waste of ingredients.  Had very little flavor.

I used chicken breasts, and boiled the liquids on the stove then poured over chicken.  After baking for 1 hr the chicken was done, but the sauce did not carmalize and was very runny.  Could not cook longer or the chicken would have been dry.  Good flavor, but I made this because the carmalzation sounded good.  Not sure will make again.

My family LOVED these.  Followed exactly, but added a bit of cornstarch and did let the sauce cook first.  I cut up some chicken breasts and put it in the pan along with the wings for my son who doesnt like wings.  Everyone loved the sauce though.  Thank you and this was very easy and cheap.

Followed the recipe to the "T" except I used boneless chicken breast. This has become a family favorite. Like the other comments,  I agree w/ caramelizing sauce on stove top until it bubbles. Next step, put glaze on top and bake. Easy & tasty!

Really good!  I did what others suggested & cooked the glaze on the stove before putting it on the chicken wings.  I used a little less honey than called for.  I also added crushed red pepper and cayenne pepper because we like it HOT.  It was a great combination, sweet & spicy.  Yum.

I had a bunch of sauce left over so the next day I shredded some chicken breasts and cooked it down into until it made nice bbq chicken sandwiches. I think I liked this even better than just covering the chicken breasts. Either way it was good though!

I tried this with chicken breasts and the flavor was great.  Next time I will reduce the sauce to 1/4 or so of the original amt. before putting it on the chicken. I only reduced it by 1/2 or so in the sauce pan and it didn't quite candy and I over cooked the chicken.  The flavor was SUPER.  Thank you!

I didn't love this recipe.  I was really disappointed after all of the good reviews this received.  I used chicken breasts and cut them into smaller pieces so they got more caramelized.  My husband and I just thought it tasted a little weird.  We ate it but I wont make it again.

I tried this recipe the other night. They sounded delicious. My tastebuds couldn't wait...and then, they were disappointed. There was only a slight taste of the sauce on the chicken. I guess I expected the sauce to be a little bit thicker and to stick to the chicken better. I won't be making these again.

I used chicken breasts instead of wings.  The sauce was pretty good, my husbad loved it; a little too sweet for my palate.  The meat was a little dry; in hind sight chicken thighs might have been a better option.  I heated the sacue on the stove top and then poured it over the chicken.  Baked it covered for 45 minutes then removed the foil and baked for another 15 minutes.

I did this recipe to a T and got the same results as everyone else with lack of caramelization. Then I experimented with the size of the pan. I used legs instead of wings and put fewer pieces into the same size to let the sauce thin on the bottom of the pan. After half of the bake time I took out the pans, flipped the chicken and basted them. But this time the sauce did caramelize. At the end of the bake time I basted one more time to get some extra sauce onto it before serving and it came out wonderfully! I also recommend marinating chicken breasts in the sauce for 20-30 minutes before baking and serving over a bed of rice.

different votes from our house here. My husband and daughter like it "as is". I found it a bit too sweet for me and the next time I made it I added doubled the garlic, added 1 TB of white wine vinegar and 1 TB of lemon juice to cut the sweetness. That version came out more to my liking....the other 2 liked the second version too....more sweet n sour than just sweet....so it all depends on your tastes here. (I had halved the recipe for only 3 of us.....so 2 TB each for a full batch). I also used boneless chicken strips. Wings are too much work for too little meat for me!

Didn't like this sauce.  Must thaw chicken before cooking!!!!  I think I thickened the sauce too much, it needed to be more runny.  Overall, not one of our favs.

AMAZING! The only thing I would change, would be to add less honey. My husband and I found them so tasty but waaaaay too sweet. The second time I made them, I only added 2/3 of a cup... that was more than enough.

This was just ok. I followed the recipe exactly, and was not super impressed. The ketchup did not mix very well with the honey, making the chicken not look very appetizing. I probably wouldnt make this again.

This was super yummy, my husband LOVED it and he is so picky about sauces.  At the last minute i realized I didnt quite have enough honey so I just topped it off with some syrup.  I was afraid it was going to be too sweet but it wasnt...and it was sooo sticky.  I followed the previous posters advice and used their recipe to make a thicker sauce and was delicious!

I made these for superbowl and they were a hit!  Everybody loved them.  I did add more honey because it was too watery.  Fantastic recipe though.  I am making them again for a picnic with friends this weekend.

Very yummy! After reading some other reviews I made a few changes....I added a cornstarch/water slurry to thicken it once it came to a boil. Also reduced the honey by half.  I poured it over boneless/skinless chicken thighs and baked.   It was a huge hit, everyone loved it and wants me to make it again soon.  Would be great served over rice.

Excellent, it didn't last long in my house.  I thought that I had made enough to have leftovers the next day.  I didn't have honey in the house so I looked up honey substitute  so I used 1!/2 cups sugar plus water and it came out wonderful.

I made this using a combination pack of wings, thighs, and drum sticks for my super bowl party and it was AMAZING! Everyone loved it. It was fall-of-the-bone tender. This is a new favorite at our house!

This was great!   I used chicken legs and didn't thicken the sauce in the pan, instead I broiled on Lo for about 2 minutes at the end.  This made the coating nice and sticky and thick.  Served it with brown rice and stir fry veggies; it was even gobbled up by my 3.5 year old son.

Very good, I did double the sauce boil it and add a cornstarch slurry to help thicken it. I only wish I could of removed the skin off the wings cause we don't like eating it unless it's fried. It was impossible to removed without removing too much meat from the wings. This is one of the only chicken dishes my 3 year old ate though. I know it was cause of the sweet sauce but who cares, she actually ate chicken!

Very average, no kick.  Better on legs than boneless breasts, needs a little something else to bring more taste to the party though.

I really wanted to like this but it just didn't have enough flavor for us other than over powering sweet. I did cook the sauce with cornstarch like other reviewers suggested. I liked the consistancy and the way the sauce stuck to the chicken though just not the over powering sweet taste.

Excellent!  My husband and I are from Buffalo and he begged me to make Buffalo wings for the Superbowl.  I didn't want the mess of deep frying so I tried this recipe instead and he loved them.  Cooked them for about an hour and 15 mins before the sauce carmelized, and the chicken was still moist and delicious.

this was absolutly wonderful, I put in about 3/4 c ketchup and warmed the sauce on the stove top, I also added 2 tbsp corn starch that i mixed with about 1/3 c. cold water but I added that to the sauce about 1 min. before it was done cooking on the stove top, I also used chicken legs, cooked the chicken in the oven covered for 40 min. pulled it out poured on sauce (reserving about 3/4 c) and baked it in oven for 10 more min. then added the rest of sauce and placed it under broiler on low for 2-3 min. comes out perfect, very tender & tasty, and not extremely sweet

I didn't have any honey, so instead I used a smaller amount of barbecue sauce for sweetness. Like others, I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, and boiled the sauce with cornstarch before pouring over the chicken. I also added a little more garlic than was called for. The result was absolutely delicious. A recipe to keep for sure!

We didn't love this.  The sauce consistency was good, I added some cornstarch and boiled the sauce to thicken before pouring over the chicken.  It was the flavor that we didn't love.  I'm trying to find something that tastes like the Honey BBQ wings from KFC.

Super Bowl Party loved it. The kids devoured them and the men loved them but wanted some heat.  I personally thought they had too much soy sauce taste.  Next time I will decrease the oil (maybe use sesame oil) and decrease the soy sauce.  Oh I did have to use half brown sugar because I ran out of honey.  And I did baste them through out the baking time.

Wow! HUGE success! I made 5 lbs of wings for the superbowl party we had. They were GONE in maybe 10 min! I just wish I had more! I made sauce on stove and used cornstarch as others suggested. I took each wing and dipped in the sauce and then let them soak for a hour in fridge before baking. Baked 1 hour on 375.  The taste....WOW!  I did think I would ad more cornstarch to thinken even more but the taste is Great!  Everyone wanted more.  I'm planning on making chicken breasts tonight with this receipe!  Yum! Yum! Yum!  Thank you VERY much for the great post!

This was wonderful. I loved the sauce! I lightened the recipe using boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Close... but next time I will cut the breasts into large chunks to allow the sauce to coat more surface area. By the way, you save almost 10 grams of fat per serving using chicken breasts.

Sauce had a great flavor.  I cooked on the stove top for 20 minutes and thickened with some cornstarch mixed with water at the end.  I gave four stars because the sauce would have been too thin if this had not been done.  I made with chicken tenders as suggested by others - I'm sure it would have been even better caramelized on wings with skin.

Pretty good. I made it using boneless, skinless breasts and drumsticks. Didn't really caramelize, but the sauce tasted good on rice.

I was so excited to make this dish because of all the great reviews. I thought it was ok, but there are several factors that could have affected why. I used low sodium soy sauce so the flavor wasn't "over powered" by soy sauce flavor like other reviewers said. Also, I'm pregnant so my taste buds are different.  However, I have to add that I was really craving chicken legs tonight and they DID hit the spot. My husband is not a huge soy sauce fan so I made half the chicken with regular BBQ sauce, and honestly I liked those better! I used the reviewer's suggestion in boiling the soy sauce mixture before and adding corn starch to thicken it and it worked great. The legs were very juicy because I left the skin on (but didn't eat it) with both sauces so overall, this recipe's technique was great. I just personally prefered the BBQ sauce.

Eventhough am not a fan of sweet and sour dishes but this actually turned out pretty good. I followed some of the users suggestions of cooking the sauce mix a while before putting it over the chicken and to offset the sweetness of honey i added a bit of chili to the sauce. Chicken should be marinated beforehand with some salt and pepper.

The flavor was fantastic. But the sauce was very thin and didn't coat well. I ended up using it to flavor the rice instead. Otherwise not too bad. (Best to use fresh chopped garlic rather than jarred.)

I know this recieved great reviews but I thought that is was just ok.  I made the mixture exactly as stated but I used boneless, skinless breast.  I think the soy sauce was too overpowering (and I like soy sauce!).  Also, the sauce was trying to burn in the pan after only cooking for 35 min.  I probably would not make this again.  Sorry.

I made this last night exactly as the recipe stated.  It was good.  I added a little hot chili paste to mine, but it was lost in the honey/soy mixture.  I think next time I will add a couple of Tablespoons.  I will also cut the soy down a hair- a little too much for my taste.  The chicken came out good and we enjoyed it.  Thanks for sharing.

Good recipe. One small change...I used 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Alittle afraid the honey would be too much. Also simmered stovetop about 15 minutes and basted several times throughout the baking time.  Will definately make again. Thank you.

I loved the taste of this sauce! It was perfect! I followed the suggestion of a reviewer who said to use 3/4 cup ketchup, 3/4 cup honey, 3-4 garlic cloves, & I also added about 1 1/2 tsp of cornstarch. I brought the sauce to a boil on the stove which thickened it up quite a bit, then I let it rest for a bit. but I think I will still add a little bit more cornstarch to the sauce next time. Someone else said to use 2 tbsps. I also think I'll add half of the sauce to the chicken & halfway through I'll add the rest of the sauce, maybe that'll help thicken it up a little more. I will definitely make this again! Everyone loved it, even though it wasn't as thick as I'd like it to be.

Really tasty chicken recipe and so easy to prepare.  I came home tonight looking for a fast recipe to hopefully prepare and cook in less than a hour and this was it. I sliced the chicken breasts into 2 inch strips and reduced the time to 1/2 hour.  Also followed the previous reviewers suggestions for cooking the sauce a bit beforehand to get the right consistency and took out the oil - it doesn't need it. The entire fam loved it, too.

Great flavor!  I used whole bone in, skin on chicken breasts and based several times while they cooked.  Very tender and juicy!

I made these wing to see if they were as good as everyone said, and Yes you were all right! They were delicious and the chicken came right off the bone. I added some extra garlic cloves, and chopped onions to the recipe and got a "those wings rock" from my husband. I will definetly make these again soon.

I followed the directions of the most helpful review for boneless skinless breast.  Results were not good.  The sauce did thicken in the pan, but in the oven, it got all watery again. The taste was weird too. Totally did not like at all. Would never make again. Feel like wasted meat.

Made  this last night. Was OK, but I did not care for the sauce as much as some of the other reviews. I followed other suggestions and boiled on top of stove with 1 tbs of cornstarch. The sauce DID thicken nicely and stuck to the chicken, so that was a good tip. Hubby said was "good", but prefers BBQ sauce to this also.

Ok, but nothing great. Simple and no fuss. I had to put the wings back in the oven on a sheetpan after cooking them to get them to "Carmelize" instead of swim in sauce.

Used chicken breasts cut up into bite sized pieces. Added hot sauce and a little more garlic as suggested by a reviewer. Also made extra sauce and heated on stove top then poured over chicken and rice before serving. It was great!! I am definitely going to make it again - thanks!

I love barbecue chicken, but could not get my husband to eat it until I made this recipe. The only thing I changed was using drumsticks instead of wings. & removing the skin prior to baking. It's wonderful & truly sticky, so you get the flavor in every bite.

This was really good but I don't think I made enough sauce.  I reportioned the recipe for 2 servings because I had 2 boneless chicken breasts.  Next time I will make the full amount of sauce because while the sauce thickened nicely the chicken was just a bit dry.  I will definitely give this another try.  My son gave it 2 thumbs up!

Overall I thought this was an ok recipe. I cut the 'glaze' in half, used 1.5 lbs of boneless/skinless chix breasts and added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch. I boiled the glaze on the stove for a few minutes and cooked the chix at 350* 40 minutes.

This was delicious! Not as sticky as I thought it would be but then again I didn't have a full cup of honey. Was not sure how good the combination of honey, garlic, and ketchup would taste but this was phenomenal! Great recipe!

I used boneless chicken and took the recomendations of others when using the boneless chicken to cook the sauce on the stove. I also added a little corn starch and added onion as well. the onion added a great flavor. I baked my chicken in a dutch oven and then drained the drippings before adding the sauce. I may use this recipe as a cut chicken over rice since it is a little on the sweeter side. The sauce was thick, and I even seasoned my chicken with red pepper.   I really did like this and it remined me of that sweet Burbon chicken I like (but without the Burbon)...might try and mess around with that next time... :)

I would have rated this a five, but the sauce did not get sticky and gooey like I wanted it to. Next time I will take the advice of other reviewers and cook the sauce on the stove first. But everyone loved the wings anyway!

Pretty good.  Bf complained it was gooey--he apparently likes crispy chicken wings like you get when you fry--but otherwise liked the flavor and the wings themselves.  I am not a fan of wings, but these weren't too bad.  thanks for the recipe!

Oh my god this turned out so good! I loved all of the flavors, it tasted like Ginger Chicken from PF Changs, and I love that dish! I doubled the ketchup and halved the honey. Just couldn't get the sauce to carmelize, instead it turned out more like a liquid. Even better the next day chopped in an asian chicken salad!

I doubled the sauce, heated on the stove until boiling, reduced heat, poured over 5lbs of chicken legs and thighs and baked at 375 for an hour.  My husband and I both thought this chicken was a nice change, but the flavor didn't permeate the meat as well as I had hoped.  I'm hoping after a night in the fridge, our leftovers will soak up more of the flavor.

Awesome, easy recipe!  I made this with drumsticks, and they were so juicy!  The kitchen smelled so good too.

I was glad to find this recipe that I didn't need to marinate first. I did have to warm up the sauce in the microwave a bit so that it blended well before I poured it over the chicken. The chicken turned out great, and I'll be making again.

Great recipe! I boiled the sauce mixture on the stovetop and added 1 tbsp cornstarch for thickness. I also added more ketchup and also added BBQ sauce and the flavor was excellent. I had to cook the wings at 450, but they came out great and were gone quickly. Thanks for sharing this great recipe. :)

The flavor of this sauce is amazing! Kind of honey bbq w/an Asian flair. The sauce didn't thicken for me. I actually made the sauce on the stove top & poured it over the chicken but it thinned out as it baked, so I dumped it back into a saucepan to thicken(with some help from a little cornstarch & water). Served w/rice & oriental style green beans. LOVED it!!

I made this with a whole chicken and it came yummy.  Everyone loved it.  I did cook the sauce on the stove top first with corn starch, and it did thicken up a bit.  I love just a seasoned baked chicken, but this was an excellent change.  I will be making this over and over again.  Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly, however i did boil the sauce before adding it to the chicken.  I covered the chicken for the first 30 minutes, but next time i will not.  Uncovered, the sauce thickened better.  Even covered for half the baking time, the sauce stuck to the chicken very well.  It was a big hit with my husband, so I will be making this often.

We liked these, but the sauce was a bit thin, and I would have liked it to coat the chicken more.  The flavor is nice and the chicken was very tender and moist, but the flavor of the sauce didn't really penetrate into the chicken.  Next time, after mixing the sauce, I'll boil it and then allow it to reduce a bit, for a "stickier" wing.  I'll add 4 cloves for a bit more flavor, and some extra seasonings to the chicken before adding the sauce.  A good recipe, could be great with a few small alterations.

I am really quite surprised that this recipe has such a high rating. I found it disappointing. My daughter could not even eat it. I followed the recipe to a "t" and had no problem getting the sauce to thicken, so I guess I would say it "turned out" right, we just did not care for the taste. I am still very confused as to why so many people gave a good rating, usually I can count of the ratings at this site regarding recipes but this one has thrown me for a loop. I really wish I could get my money back for the ingredients!

This made a super departure from our usual hot wings. Sweet and spicy! We added a little vinegar to make them a little less sweet.

The sauce had a delicious taste but I rate this a 4 instead of a 5 because I couldn't get it to caramelize. I even cooked the sauce on a stovetop first as a lot of people suggested.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I have a Mesquite BBQ marinade, and marinaed the chicken for 4-5 hours, then used the leftover marinade as the base for the sauce, rather than the soy.  WONDERFUL flavor, and very tender chicken!  We didn't have wings on hand, but used drumsticks and they were absolutely great.  This is a new favorite at our house!

This was delicious!  I made the sauce in a pan w/ some cornstarch and poured it over tendorized boneless chicken breast. Also like another reviewer, I sliced it and threw it back in the sauce for about 5 minutes.  It was so tender and yummy you could cut it with a fork. All three kids give it a thumbs up!

My family really liked this chicken.  The sauce never thickened up, but it would have been perfect over rice.  (I didn't have any).  I made the wings, and saved the extra sauce-reused it on boneless chicken breasts for sandwiches. YUM!

A bit sweet but great recipe. I boiled the sauce in a pan with cornstarch before adding to chicken and I doubled the sauce as it did not look as if it was enough. I basted every 15 minutes and the end result was still a bit runny but caramelized very nicely.

The flavor was great but I can't rate it a 5 becuase for some reason mine did not turn out sticky at all.  They were soupy.  Like I said though, the taste was good, just not what I was looking for.  I'll read some reviews to see what may have went wrong.

This was a very good recipe, however, I give it a four since my wings could have used a little more crisp to them. I followed other suggestions and used all of the same ingredient measurements and brought them to a boil over the stove first and added two tablespoons of cornstarch baked covered for 45 minutes and then removed foil and cooked for 15 more minutes. I will definitely try this with a chicken breast.

Fabulous--my kids and hubby loved this chicken.  I used bone-in thighs and it was moist and flavorful.  Easy and delicious.  Everyone wants to know when I'm going to make it again.  I didn't have any ketchup (3 ketchup-loving kids used it all) so I used some ketchup-based chili sauce.  It gave it a little kick and turned out fine.

Man this was gooooood! Used boneless breast (cut into 3), thigh boneless, & drums. As per someone's suggestion, boiled the sauce and let simmer before pouring on chicken pieces, (makes it thicker). Doubled sauce. Among the best tasting chicken I've had.

I did this with a few boneless chicken thighs & only baked them for around 30-40 minutes and they turned out great. I didn't wait for the sauce to caramelize entirely but it wasn't a big deal since i served it over rice.

Bake longer at 375 degrees approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes or so, just keep basting & will eventually caramelize. I will make this again!

Not to be cruel or anything, but my expectations for this dish far exceeded what it actually tasted like.  It had a funny smell while cooking and tasted way too sweet.  I could hardly finish my piece of chicken.  I am giving it a one because my husband said it was okay, but I am definitely not cooking this again.

Our family loved this recipe!  First of all, fresh chicken works best because of that salt solution that is injected and then runs out and makes your sauce non-sticky. Second of all, it is even better reheated the next day because it is extra sticky!  YUMMY!  This is going into the rotation!

Thanks for a great recipe. My husband really enjoyed but suggested next time after baking covered for 45 minutes...grill for a few minutes to crisp them up.

Very good. I do not eat meat, but my husband loved this recipe. I poured the sauce over brown rice-and wanted it to be a little on the runny side like other people have complained about. I served with broccoli steamed with a lemon-butter sauce and toasted almonds.

I'm surprised this got such high ratings. I cooked the sauce on the stove top and added corn starch to the mixture. I used boneless chicken breasts and poured the sauce over top and cooked for 20 minutes at 400 degrees. It was very sweet. My husband and boys told me not to bother making it again.

I made the sauce as the recipe stated, but I used chicken thighs instead.  I cooked it for 30 minutes at 400 degrees and it came out really good.  I thought it was going to be a bit salty with all the soy sauce, but it wasn't.  I would just add some grated ginger next time to add some more flavor.  I would definitely make this again!

Boyfriend loved this... i boiled the sauce before pouring it on the chicken tenders, but it was still very watery. BF said it was yummy though. I did have some left over sauce and put that on the stove and reduced to a thick delicious syrup/dipping sauce.  I actually drizzled it over fried rice!  Delish!

What a delicious recipe! I used leg quarters and as suggested I cooked the sauce in a saucepan first.  I did not add cornstarch because I wanted it be juicy so I can pour the juices over steamed white rice.  I covered for half an hour then bake uncovered for half hour basting every 10 minutes.  The smell while it is baking is heavenly!  The taste was even better. Kids really liked it. Will make again!

When I first tasted the sauce I was a little skeptical and did not think the chicken would turn out that good.  In the past week I have used it twice!!!  This is really good.  I added some crushed red peppers and brown sugar like other reviewers suggested.  Thanks for this recipe.

I used this for 10 drumsticks and they came out really good. My husband likes his chicken cooked and then cooked again so my drumsticks came out a bit too caramelized. 10 drumsticks would have been cooked by 30 minutes so next time I'll have to do that.

Chicken was delicious but it did not caramelize the way I had hoped.  It was more like a savory sauce. Probably my bad cooking!

EXCELLENT!  This just might replace my Mom's famous chicken wings.  They have great strong flavor for not having to marinate.  I did cook for 1 hour (30 minutes on each side).  I might try pre-cooking the sauce on the stovetop next time, but they still turned GREAT!  I broiled for 5 minutes after the full hour just to add a crispy texture.  DELICIOUS!!

This recipe is awesome!  So easy and the taste is wonderful!  It has an Oriental flavor to it.  I didn't have enough honey and used karo syrup to make the rest which was about 1/4 cup.  Am going to make it again with all honey.  Thanks!

I doubled the sauce as I was using boneless, skinless, chicken breasts.  The flavor didn't actually pop as much as I thought it would, but still very good.  Boyfriend liked it a lot.

I was going to give this three stars but my 10 year old niece actually liked it so it earned another star - she's very picky! It wasn't a bad recipe just not one that I enjoyed. I might do this for a snack for my kids again but wouldn't make it as a main dish. It is too sweet as a main dish, IMO.

This turned out great!  I was worried that my honey might have not been good, or mess up the recipie.  It seemed to be hard, I stuck it in the micro then added it to the other ing.  It was a little watery but i flipped it twice.  This worked well because it seemed to cover the chicken well.  Also it did not take the full hour to cook.  It was only about 40 minutes in a convection oven and the chicken was still partially frozen before it went in.  My father (who is very old school, and picky) even had seconds :)

Ummm ummm good.  This recipe was very good.  I followed the advice of the raters and used half cup of honey, half cup of ketchup, added 2 teaspoons of cornstarch and cooked the sauce on the stove before poruing over chicken. Although the sauce didn't caramelize it was still very good.

made this this evening - used the altered ingredients the last reviewer suggested and boiled prior to pouring over the chicken. baked for about an hour. next time i am going to do this on chicken breasts so i can eat more of the glaze (hard to do when you have skin-on chicken). absolutely delicious! my family loved it.

This turned out wonderful for me! I can not believe how easy and fast it was! I also brought the sauce to a boil before pouring it on over chicken and lightly seasoned the meat. The aroma from the chicken baking fill my house and it tasted as good as it smelled!! I also used sugarfree honey and it turned out great!! I strongly recommend this recipe to everyone.

This reminded me of something I used to eat as a child. I will make it again. I found that it did need a bit longer than an hour to cook.

This recipe is delicious but definitely needs to be baked the whole hour if using drumsticks or bone-in chicken.  Some of the suggestions for thicker sauce are good, but that will add to the cook time as well, depending on the amount of chicken.  Overall, delicious!!

The only thing I did differently was ½ cup honey and ½ cup ketchup and cut up the chicken breast into pieces. This was great. Thank you so much for the recipe.

i didnot pour sauce on top of chicken, but marinaded in salt, some chilli powder and soy sauce for an hour. then added the other ingredients. reduced honey to about 1/2 cup. baked for about 1 hr. it turned out really great. will try on chicken legs next time. I am thinking of adding some tamarind chutney next time for some tangy flavour, or maybe increase the ketchup as other readers suggested. thanks for the recipe.

Very easy and tasty. Flipped chicken halfway through baking. Next time will try the thicker sauce method suggested by other reviewers by cooking sauce on stovetop first.

Outstanding! Followed the directions exactly except I used 1/3 c. Soy and 3/4 c. honey (it was all I had left of each) flavors were fantastic. I also poured the sauce out when I pulled the chicken and put it in a saucepan on med-high to thicken before service and it worked a treat. Will definately do this for the family again, got raves and kudos for it. Thanks.

Pretty good recipe, although I think an hour is a bit too long. I had very thick boneless chicken breasts and was thinking I would probably have to cook them longer, but after an hour they were a little bit tough, still had great flavor, just wish the chicken had been more tender, I topped each breast with a slice of carambola for a little character =) very cute Thanks for the recipe I will use it again just cut down on cooking time

This was very yummy and my family loved it! I used skinless chicken breast and 1/4 c. soy sauce 1/2c. ketchup & 1 c. honey which I caramelized on the stove before I put it on the chicken to bake. My husband even suggested that next time he cook it out on the grill so we will be making this again soon!

Excellent! As others recommended, I cooked the sauce on the stove, added 2 Tbls cornstarch, boiled until thickened. Poured over boneless skinless breasts, covered and cooked about 35-40 min at 400.  My husband loved it!

Four stars for the fact that the sauce did not carmalize.  But the taste was there and was good.  I too did my sauce on the stovetop for 10 minutes or so on med.  I poured over boneless chicken breasts and baked for 35 minutes at 350.  The chicken was so very moist.  But it did not carmalize.  I think I had too much sauce in my dish..maybe next time I will pour over to just cover and see if that does the trick.

A very good basic starter for a "honey- garlic" type chicken dish.  I let my chicken marinate in the sauce for an hour before baking.  I added extra garlic powder for more favor, cut back a bit on the amount of soya sauce. 
All in all a good recipe, but have to agree with other reviews that the sauce didn't thicken up like I was expecting it to do.

i made this last night with boneless skinless chicken breasts. the 1/2 cup soy sauce was a little too salty for me, so i used only about a 1/4. per other reviews, i baked in the oven on 350 for about 40 minutes and it was good. made again tonight for others, and was great! here's what i did : used the left over sauce from last night to marinade the breasts (butterflied) for about an hour. put the rest in a sauce pan, added more ingredients, and let it simmer and thicken up. i continued to baste the chicken throughout the baking. i was making side dishes that cooked on 450 and wanted to do it all together. so i baked the chicken on 400 for about an hour, then turned it down to 350 for about 20 minutes. it was tender and moist throughout. a definite do again!

Made this tonight and not a smidgeon was left!!  I substituted 1/4 cup of the honey for brown sugar thinking that might help the caramelization issue but it didn't seem to... so I just took a baster and took out most of the marinade and cooked a bit longer to get the skin crispy.  Everyone loved it!!  Will definitely make again!

This wasn't bad if you like baked chicken.  I followed others' reviews and cooked the sauce on the stove first for a while on low.  I did a pan of wings (as the recipe suggests) and a pan of chicken breasts. To me, the wings were a 4.5 and the breasts were a 3.  The breasts were too dry.  The sauce did caramelize a bit better on the breasts though.  Either way, I will likely make this recipe again, but it won't be a weekly (or even monthly) occurrence.  Occasionally, it's a nice change. :) I'd give it a 4.5 if I could.

This was really good!  I made it on the fly when I had nothing in the house to make for dinner.  This recipe's ingredients are perfect for that!  I improvised to taste (I put lots more garlic in!) and put it all with some sliced carrots in a pot and brought to boil then turned down heat and cooked as recommended or 10 minutes.  I sliced two chicken breasts in long slices and put in a casserole dish and poured the sauce and carrots on top.  I baked at 400 degrees or 20 minutes.  Made plenty of rice to go with it!  It was delicious!  I went from having nothing to make for dinner to being absolutely stuffed!  Can't wait to try more veggied next time (celery, mushrooms, onions, snap peas, peppers, etc)!

Soooo good! It doesn't caramelize that well for me. I have made this recipe at least once a month for years now (been meaning to rate it for a long time now) but I am OK with it not caramelizing that well for me because I always make white rice and drizzle the leftover sauce on my rice. We love love love this dish! Oh, and since I don't like meat on the bone, I make it with chicken breast.

Sweet, tangy and wonderful!  I made some changes as well based on other reviews.  I used ketchup, honey, a mixture of soy sauce and worcestershire, garlic powder, and a dash of hot sauce.  I boiled it on the stove top first, then poured it over boneless chicken breasts and cooked for 35 min.  Very tasty!!

I cooked this both the orgianl way and the suggested thicker version on boneless breasts and the flavors just didn't seem to blend well to compliment the chicken.

I didn't care for this recipe. The sauce had an odd aroma. The taste too is kinda odd, can't really explain how, just odd.  We still ate it as it wasn't too bad, I just won't be making it again.  One side note; I cooked at 350 for exactly an hour and the meat was perfect, tender & moist. If you're going to cook it at 375 I suggest only 45 minutes as it may be overdone if cooked for an hour. I love baked chicken w/sauce recipes that I can serve over rice with veggies, but unfortunately this one will not stay in my box.

This sauce was awesome! Honestly, I wasn't expecting it to turn out as good as it did. I turned the chicken wings once halfway through the baking time, and the sauce caramelized nicely. Tasted nice and sweet - a nice change from hot wings! Thanks!

This recipe was great.  I ran out of honey so I used maple syrup instead & they still turned out great! I will make this again!

pretty good. I did get it to caramelize by basting it and turning it every 10 minutes.  I also browned the chicken on the George Forman (too windy to do it on the grill) to add a little more flavor. We ate it with rice and put the sauce over the rice.  It was yummy and I would rate it 5 stars but I feel I have a similar recipe that is a lot better.  I just wanted to try this one out.  I may try it again and play around with it.

WOW. My spousal unit does not like soy sauce or anything sweet on his meat!  This recipe changed his mind and has now become a staple in my arsenal of quick cooking.  I marinate chicken or pork tenderloin in this and it always ends up tasty tasty! Once for a quick change, I added sesame oil and hot chili oil to the mix, and it was pretty good too!

Well, I did the same as others suggested by cooking sauce on stove top first, and it still did not caramelize. It was tasty, but just more like a sweet barbecue sauce. A friend of mine who is a chef said that the reason for this is that honey melts, it does not caramelize. You must have sugar for it to caramelize. Still, was tasty. Definitely season your chicken breasts first and cook them without sauce for about ten minutes; gives the chicken itself more flavor. I am not opposed to making this again, but I guess I will hunt for another recipe for "caramelized" chicken.

This was good...I served it with vegetable fried rice from this site.I am only giving this 4 stars because I, like many others, had trouble with this actually carmelizing. I did thicken the sauce with cornstarch and I added some ginger paste and some cilantro to the sauce as well. Maybe this had something to do with the caramelizing, but I doubt it...that being said, I did think that the sauce was delicious- my daughter ate an entire chicken breast!(she hardly eats a thing) I will definately be making this again!!

This was absolutely amazing!!!  I tried boiling the sauce first, but still couldn't get it to thicken up.  But that was our only complaint!  Excellent - we've used it twice in the past two weeks!

I made this one for my son because it sounded like something he'd enjoy. I was right! I used boneless, skinless chicken breast tenders instead of the wings. I took the advice of others and cooked the sauce on the stove with some corn meal to thicken it. I baked it at 375 for 50 minutes. It was very juicy and flavorful. Next time I may use drumsticks and cook it in my crock pot on low while I am at work.

Tasted pretty good, but mine did not carmelize very well, despite even cooking on the stovetop ahead as suggested by others.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and next time I will cut down the cooking time a bit

Awesome chicken recipe! I usually use legs, cut the skin off, and place them upside down in the pan that already has the sauce in it. Made it many times with no complaints!

This is a great recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing! The second time I made this I was out of honey so I used grape jelly and it turned out good too! Sometimes I add some ground ginger for another type of flavor. Very good recipe!

Mmmmmm.... this is the first time that I've tried this recipe, and it was wonderful! I'll probably be making this once a week from now on. My three year old at a leg and a thigh and was asking for more! I followed the advice of several others and made the sauce on the stovetop with a little corn starch while letting the seasoned chicken cook for about 10 minutes. I also used a little more soy sauce and a little less honey. Yummy!

Used a mixture of chic breasts and legs. I used the method of making the sauce on the stove top as directed on the front page (most helpful reviews). This was good, but I think my oven was too quick/powerful for this?? the chicken was fully cooked at 35 mins and was burnt, there was smoke billowing out of my oven. I briefly (5-7mins?) turned my back to the oven to prepare mashed potatoes and veggies. It was the sauce at the bottom of the pan that was burnt in particular, the chicken was still edible. While making the chicken before the burning part, I kept checking it every 5 mins and spooning the pool of sauce at the bottom of the pan on top of the chicken. Nobody particularly enjoyed this in my family, everyone thought it was okay/passable. Maybe I will try making this on a lower heat next time since I liked the idea of using common household ingredients.

The chicken was ok, it tasted like regular baked chicken but the skin was good. It would have been better if we maybe doubled the sauce. I made it at my mother's house for a small family dinner and it gave the house a funny smell, even after we left my dog still smelt like the sauce for two days.

Based on some reviews I changed this up a little and maybe that was the downfall of the recipe. I used chicken breast and cut it up into small peices. I marinated it for a couple hours and then simmered on the stove top. They were not good at all. not much flavor even with the marinating.

This was great, although I did a few things differently.  I lightly seasoned my chicken and let it bake in the oven for about 10 minutes so the seasoning would stick and wouldn’t come off once I added the sauce.  I took the advice of the other reviewers and warmed the sauce on the stove and added a couple tablespoons of cornstarch dissolved in a little bit of water. About halfway through I flipped the chicken over so it would absorb more of the sauce. Delicious!!

This made a lovely marinade but not the sticky coating i expected-i then tried minimising the sauce in a pan whilst we ate to pour on after and we were enjoying the chicken so much that i forgot it was on,burnt the pan and had to bin it,it must have been good!!!
My kids absolutely loved it with just white rice and corn and tried to steal mine when i was out the room but hubby found it a bit plain.

This recipe was just OK for us. The sauce did not stay on the chicken but it had a good flavor. I boiled the sauce for a while on the stove but it still did not thicken up. Good but not OMG good.

Delicious. I made this chicken for our Labor Day party and it was the first thing gone and people were looking for more. Easy to make and very moist and tasty. Thank-you.

i used the mini chicken winds and legs for this recipe.  i did not have the honey, but replaced it with a cup of corn syrup like someone else suggested.  this chicken was different, and very good.  my daughter would eat it until i told her it was honey chicken.  she ate it all, then asked for more.

Great recipe.  One suggestion:  marinade chicken over night and the flavors will be a lot more intense.

My husband absolutely loved this recipe (he can be very picky). I used boneless chicken breast instead of chicken wings. I marinated the chicken in the sauce for 2 hours before cooking. I cooked my chicken on the grill and brused the caramelized sauce on this chicken while it cook. In the end I had wonderful flavored chicken with a really nice glaze.

Okay. It was easy and got varied opinions from the family. I gave it a 4 but everyone else gave it a 2 to 3 star rating. They said it was okay, but would prefer I not make it again. Personally, I would have made it again, but majority rules :-) Thanks for the recipe. This is a personal preference recipe...if the recipe sounds good to you, just give it a try...

This was really good I did change a few things. I used whole split chicken breasts and added some corn starch and  ginger to the sauce. I also lowered the cooking time to 350 for thirty minutes then 375 for the other 30 minutes. Overall this recipe came out wonderful and looked just like the picture.

This was pretty good - not as sweet as I expected, which was okay. No, it didn't carmelize and we didn't have any corn starch on hand to help the case, but we just poured the sauce over a bed of rice. Like others suggested, we cooked the sauce on the stove before baking.

I've made this several times and it's always a hit! It doesn't quite caramelize but I've noticed I can drain the extra liquid and use it as sauce - and everyone still loves it!

This is tasty!  I did as other reviewers and heated the sauce on the stovetop before putting everything in the oven.  I also added some Thai chili sauce and corn starch.  With the starch, the sauce was still very runny (and lots of it!), and the chicken sort of "boiled" in the sauce.  So I removed the wings and placed them on a baking sheet and cooked them separately for about 10 minutes and they were perfect!  I had enough sauce left over to freeze for another time.  I'll cut it in half next time.

Loved this recipe!!  Took the advice of some of the other reviewers about adding cornstarch to the sauce after it is finished baking.  It worked perfect.  The only thing I changed other than that was that I used chicken legs.  My family of 4 ate 12 pieces. Thanks for the great dinner!

This was really good, but not great. I used split breasts so maybe it would have been fantastic with wings. I will definately make this again.

This recipe was ok.  I really love sticky gooey wings, and this just didn't cut it.  I found that it had a lot of sauce, but nothing stuck to the chiken.  I felt it was wasted, as it had to go down the drain after.  I also need more flavour, which I felt this recipe didn't have.  Not bad, but not great.

This is a good recipe.  I added extra tabasco sauce.  The only negative was that my husband thought I had just dumped a bottle of BBQ sauce on the chicken, which would have been easier.

The chicken did turn out very good, tender & flvorful. A bit to sweet for me, though others really liked it. The sauce was quite liquidy after cooking, so I skimmed off the fat mixed some cornstarch w/cold water & added it to the sauce to thicken it. I used 1T cs to 2T water. and cooked it in a saucepan for a few minutes.

I'm giving it 3 stars because my kids liked it. I halved the sauce recipe and added cornstarch to it before cooking to make it thicker. It was way too sweet for my taste. My 2 year old loved it though.

I'm sorry...But I have to give this recipe a 2 star rating :( They were super simple to make...BUT These wings had absolutely NO flavor at all!! The sauce ingredients smelled delicious while the wings were baking...And I was so excited when they were finished cooking...but they had no taste....I was totally amazed and disappointed at the same time :( I used regular soy sauce, but I couldn't even taste the salt...Something is missing in this recipe...not sure what...Sorry :(

This was one of the best chicken recipes ever! I couldn't stop eating it! I left out the garlic because I figured the soy sauce would give enough of a punch, and it did. Fantastic! I will probably make this at least once a month.

Very easy to make. Took the wings straight out of the freezer and didn't have the time to let it thaw so squeezed a whole lime in water and soaked it for about 10 minutes. After I rinsed it and added green seasoning sauce, onion and seasoned salt and let it sit for a few minutes. Wings did carmelize and had a great flavour but since I don't like wings I didn't really enjoy it. Maybe next time I'll try drumsticks. My boyfriend loved it. He said if he didn't know i cooked it he would have thought it was restaurant bought.

This recipe got rave reviews from my family.  My husband hates "baked chicken"-he says it tastes slimey-but this was a big YES!  So easy, I used a cut up regular fryer-Highly recommend trying.

Ridiculously easy, but it came out very tasty. Even my BBQ snob husband loved it! I will be making more of this.

This recipe was great! Like others I had trouble getting the sauce to thicken, but it was great to dip the chicken in while eating! Super easy and really good!

When making this recipe, I first decided to heat the sauce on the stove to get the ingredients to come together.  I only had a half cup of honey, so for the rest I substituted corn syrup.  I marinated the chicken (I used large breats instead) for an hour or so and then baked at 375.  It took around 30-35 minutes for the chicken to cook and it came out great.  I only wish the sauce would have been thicker, but overall, everyone loved the chicken.  Thanks!

Great tasting sauce, this recipe does make a lot of sauce and i did end up taking some out with the turkey baster to get it too thicken a little.  I also basted the legs toward the end of cooking.  I will try this next time on pork ribs.

Good, but not quite what I expected.  I used two boneless skinless chicken breasts and cut the sauce in half.  I don't think my sauce quite carmalized.  I probably won't make this again.

This was so moist and very very tastey!  I don't like large pieces of chicken, so I used chicken breast tenderloins.  Wonderful and goes well with asian green beans.  Definitely a keeper!

I don't eat chicken wings but my family does, and they all LOVED this recipe.  I changed the servings up to 10 and used a 5lb bag of frozen wings.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I ran out of honey so I used some molassas to top off the measuring cup.

Used 6 drumsticks and halved recipe for sauce. After 30 min I began turning and basting the chicken every 5-10 minutes.  Perfection!  Can't wait to try it with wings.  Even used a little sauce on some leftover ribs.  Thanks!

I tried this with chicken breast. Then added the chicken to a stir-fry afterward. This is terrific.  I used a garlic and ginger paste that comes in a jar instead of the cloves of garlic.  And I am very pleased.  Thank you.

The flavor of the chicken with this sauce is great!  I cut up boneless, skinless breasts into bite size pieces and marinated it for a few hours in some of the sauce (stuck the rest of the sauce in the refrigerator).  I dumped the chicken along with the sauce it was marinating in into a pan and cooked it with the lid on, almost like poaching the chicken pieces in the marinade.  When it was cooked thru I added the rest of the sauce to the pan and cooked it for a little longer.  The chicken was great, but the sauce part was very liquidy/runny.  I would probably add a little cornstarch to the extra sauce before adding it to the pan the next time.  We served it over rice and really liked it.

I JUST MADE THIS TONIGHT WITH WINGS AND ONE BREAST CUT IN HALF AND SKINNED.  MY PICKY (TOO PICKY) HUSBAND GAVE IT A 3, I GIVE IT A 5 SO I GUESS IT'S A FOUR.  I THINK THIS WAS SOME OF THE BEST CHICKEN I'VE EVER MADE.  I USED THREE CLOVES OF GARLIC PUT THRU A GARLIC PRESS, AND ALSO USED HALF SOY AND HALF HOISIN SAUCE INSTEAD OF ALL SOY (AFRAID TOO SALTY).  FABULOUS, TRY IT, IT'S GREAT!  THANK YOU FOR THE POST.

Made this as directed with chicken wings and the taste is wonderful.  Didn't fully caramelize, I broiled them a couple additional minutes for a nice brown color though.  I didn't like the chicken wings because they were hard to eat and didn't have a lot of meat, so I'm making this again tonight with boneless breasts.  I also want to try it with the little drumettes as a party appetizer!

Great recipe! I used boneless breast and basted every 10-15 minutes.I did not have any garlic, so I used chopped onions and a touch of mustard. I will make again.

I'd first like to thank all the previous reviewers that totally helped me out with this recipe! I cut the recipe in half & simmered the sauce on the stovetop for 15 min. I baked the chicken at 375 for about an hour, turning it over halfway. Next time I'll baste the chicken more often. Chicken came out very moist & delicious. I also added some dried diced onion to the suace & left out any additional salt seasoning since the soy sauce took care of that flavor! Excellent recipe; thanks so much!

Very yummy.  Used on boneless chicken breasts and cooked out on the charcoal grill and basted every 5-6 minutes with the sauce. Carmalized beautifully. Will make again and again! Thank you!

This does have a wierd smell to it while baking. The flavor is just okay and you can definitely have the soy sauce and honey for the sauce.

I used this recipe on whole breasts...the outside was absolutely delicious.  The flavor didn't reach the inside of the chicken...but I would make this one again.  Next time I'll do wings.  I also cooked the mix beforehand like someone else suggested and it carmelized beautifully!

I loved it, however my wife and son thought it was too salty.  I think next time, I will use less soy sauce, and increase the ketchup and honey.

I used this on chicken breasts and was really tasty. I took the left over juice from the pan and thickened it with corn starch for a great dipping sauce! My kids loved it.

I made this recipe exactly as written, with exception of the wings, changed to legs and thighs. Came out terrific and the whole family raved how good it was. There were no leftovers. Will definitely make this recipe again.

This was great - even my four year old, who is crazy tired of chicken, wanted a third helping (!).  I didn't use the full amount of honey and used a 
large-ish garlic clove.  I used bone-in chicken breasts with the rib meat (on sale) and I also basted every twentey minutes or so.  Will keep this recipe and use again!  Thanks!

I added brown sugar to this recipe and the end result was very good.  I turned and basted several times to achieve top gooey-ness.  My only complaint was that all through baking I thought it was going to turn out terrible because of the way it smelled, the aroma was definately not mouth-watering but for some reason they still tasted great..

This was a very tasty sauce. I didn't have garlic so I used garlic powder and still came out fine. I also used legs but they came out very well. Would make this again.

I used on chicken breast then sliced up and put on a tossed salad it was delicious.  I can't wait to make with wings then probably will be a five star.

The chicken itself was very good. My house smelled like it for days, though. I am giving it three stars because it was so hard to clean up from I am not sure if I will make it again. I even covered my pan with foil, but the honey mixture creep under the foil and "glued" it to the pan.

I made this with chicken tenderloins from Sam's Club, cut the cook time to 40 minutes and they were totally amazing. Easy to pair up with some mixed veggies and croissants. Easy, fast, and totally delicious!

Well,hmmm. This was good, I will say. But not a knock out. It fit the quick and easy meal I was looking for. The flavor was mild. I guess you should marinate ahead of time and maybe add Brown Suger. This will help to carmalize as well as give it a little more flavor. Don't know if I'll make again, but not bad.

The flavor was great, but my sauce was like water! I removed the wings to a bowl with a slotted spoon, then let the sauce continue to bake for another 30 minutes, then poured it over the chicken. That did the trick. Next time I will try using a baking sheet; maybe being spread out a little more will help the sauce reduce faster. I'm also thinking of adding a Tbs or so of chili sauce.

I used the sauce to marinated the chicken legs before i baked them. And I also saved some to brush on the chicken legs 5 minutes before I took them out of the oven. Good flavor, both my husband and I like it very much! And i have been using the recipe often. :-)

An excellent recipe!  This seemed to make a little too much marinade for 3 pounds of chicken - I think you could probably spread it to 4 pounds.

This recipe is awesome, but like someone recommended I turned the chicken half way through and marinated it for 24 hours, also broiling for 5 minutes when it's done.  I only like this with wingettes or drummettes though, if I use bigger pieces of chicken the flavor doesn't soak through the meat enough for me.  Yummy!  First time I made this my daughter lost a tooth in it!

My boyfriend liked this recipe. He thought it was average. I personally thought it was a little to soy saucy. (a little salty). I heated the sauce with a little cornstarch beforehand as other readers suggested and it did caramelize.

The sauce carmalized very nicely, and looked beautiful.  However, I sensed an off smell, and it tasted like it smelled.  This wasn't horrible.  We ate it.  My fiance will take the leftovers in to work for lunch, but it's not something I"ll go out of my way to make again.

Very good, though it took longer to cook than stated. I used chicken breast strips, and the leftovers were great in a stir-fry with carrots and green beans, over white rice. Delicious and versatile. Thanks!

This recipe was just "alright". I didn't have any problems with the chicken caramelizing, although it smelled incredibly soy-saucy. It tasted better than it smelled. The wings don't reheat well, so make sure your family eat them up the first night! If you are not a soy-sauce fan, this is NOT the recipe for you.

This chicken was easy but the end result was just ok.  I was only able to use boneless chicken breasts, they turned out very tender and juicy but I didn't care for the sweetness.  This chicken was reminiscent of pineapple chicken without the pineapple, it was a little too sweet and kind of fruity tasting, despite adding other things to cut back on that.  Although it was easy, I'm going to pass on this one and consider making the bourbon chicken recipe instead.

I've tried this recipe twice because the sauce is really good.  I tried with chicken breast and drumsticks, but it's just didn't turn out the way I hoped.  The sauce doesn't soak through.  Maybe this would work better if the chicken is marinated.  Plus I never got the sauce to carmelize.  I think I'll just find another recipe.

This was good, but not the best chicken I've had. Definetly does not need the oil as chicken is quite fatty. I used more ketchup about 1/4 cup and a little less honey. The sauce did not caramelize.

I'm honestly baffled and disappointed by all the rave reviews!  I tried this last night and it was too sweet--that's all it was. SWEET!  I'm not sure if it's because I lean towards spicier foods but it was just bland and sweet and I even added extra garlic.  

If you love spicy foods, I don't recommend this at all.

It was very good. Everyone loved it. I used a whole chicken cut up and skin removed. With that large ammount of chicken I didn't expect it to caramelize. Too much juice from the meat. Regardless, it was good, juicy and tender. great  with a big baked potato. I'll make again. Next time with wings but with added hot wing sauce (Stubb's brand) since we like our wings with some zip.

Nxt time i'll use a wee less soy sauce and more ketchup to give it a more tangy taste.When e chicken is done,i heated e sauce on e stove & added corn starch,this way,it'll caramelized well.Overall,I think this recipe is worth trying out =)

Two of my four kids and I LOVED the flavor of this sauce.  It reminds me of the bourbon chicken served at mall food court chinese restaurants.  My husband said it was passable and my other two kids are just too stubborn and picky to try or accept anything new.  I used boneless breasts and decreased the cooking time by half so the sauce wasn't carmelized when the chicken was done.  I just transferred it to a sauce pan and thickened it with cornstarch then poured it back over the chicken.  We poured the spare sauce over our rice.  It was DELICIOUS!

Just delicious!  I was low on honey so I used half honey and half corn syrup.  Served it with lemon Basmati rice and lightly steamed brocolli florets.......a dinnertime HIT.

This recipe was so easy. I made it with boneless, skinless chicken breasts and they were so tender! All four of my kids ate it! My husband said "this one is a keeper".

I made this recipe not too long ago.  A definite keeper.  So easy to make!  
The topping didn't carmelize for me, but I think it was because I didn't use 
enough honey.  I'm trying the recipe again for Mother's day, I'm sure it will
be a big hit.  Thanks!

Wow-this certainly stands up to the 300+ 5 star reviews!  I used half molasses, half honey and added some chile powder.  The taste was impeccable, but it didn't caramelize possibly due to the molasses.  Even though I was forced to use molasses this time as I had run out of honey, I still think I would use it the next time for a richer taste and color, but still sweet flavor.

Made this a few nights ago. My wings came out very tender but would have preferred them crispy. A little on the sweet side but this recipe is worth trying again and experimenting with.

I used cut up bonelss breasts instead of wings and found the cooking time a bit long (the meat was dry), but with a time adjustment this will be GREAT!!!! I can see how the wings would be fabulous!

I added a little flour and brown sugar to my recipe to make the liquid a little thicker, but I loved it overall and my husband was very happy also.

Amazing,although messy to clean up. My four year old asks for "sticky chicken" for supper all the time. I must say that this is one of the few recipies I have never added or changed anything in. Perfect the way it is!

I just finished making this recipe using wings and it was DELICIOUS! I used a little less honey than recommended and I added half a teaspoon or so of hot sauce which added a nice mild kick.Also, I put the salt and pepper to taste right on to the wings instead of in the sauce and it was great.I served with macaroni and cheese for a nice Saturday dinner.

I was suprised at the great reviews.  I made the recipe last night as mentioned except that I used legs.  I had no problems, as others reported, with the carmelizing. Although my boyfriend and I ate the dish for dinner I wouldn't make this again.  I found the taste too strong, almost tasted burnt. I did leave the chicken in the oven for an hour and it looked great but the taste of the glaze is awful, edible but not worth making. I did rub the chicken with salt and pepper before adding the glaze and it wasn't too salty as others mentioned. I may attempt to make this again but using teriyaki, instead of soy sauce, as one of the other reviewers mentioned. It wasn't salty but had a strange taste.

It's very delicious!  I baked it with no cover, and a little longer than the recipe calls for.  It caramelized perfectly.  I don't think it would if I covered it, though!

It was wonderful!!!  My kids and husband loved it!  It's really easy and my sauce thickened.  Woohoo!  lol.  I had to substitute some sugar and water for honey because I only had half a cup of honey, but it still tasted great.  I used chicken thighs and legs and think it would make a great stir fry sauce.  I highly recommend it.

I've made this 3 times so far.  The first time, I had forgotten to buy the soy sauce so I used teriyaki sauce, which came out very good.  I also used chicken drumsticks and thighs as well as some wings.  Then the next time I made it, I used soy sauce, and the third time, a combination of soy sauce and teriyaki (I was low on soy again!).  Everyone agreed that the first time I made it, with just teriyaki sauce was the best, so that will be the way I make it from now on.

I also added 1 tsp. fresh ginger & 2 large cloves of garlic. I used chicken quarters, and let them marinate in the sauce for four hours. Can't wait to try it out on wings. Anna H.

This was so easy and so good!  The first time I put boneless, skinless chicken breasts in a 9x13 pan and poured it over the top.  The second time I poured it over a pheasant, baked it, and served it with Egg Fried Rice! It was WONDERFUL!  Thanks!

I had my doubts about this one, but I gave it a try anyway.  PERFECT!!.  My next time would be to modify the recipe, as I personally didnt feel the garlic was needed to achieve flavor.  I'll be omitting the garlic and adding a bit more salt to taste.  Sandy, you submitted a winner.

Even with all the great reviews, I still wasn't sure if we would like this.  I used chicken drumsticks and they turned out nicely.  Next time I plan to try it with chicken breats and use it in a stir fry.

Okay, I have to admit that I loved this recipe!  I did have to add my stamp to it, however.  I added about a 1/2 teaspoon of ginger to it which gave it a little zip, but otherwise I followed the recipe as written.  I also used chicken quarters, and the meat just fell off the bone. Definitely a keeper!

Very tasty -- tangy, sticky, sweet.  As many have suggested, it's great to pour extra sauce over rice.  Sugar-snap peas were an excellent accompaniment as well.

I have to admit, when I read all the ingredients I was a little skeptical that it would turn out good, but I needed something fast for dinner and I happen to have all the ingredients for it so, I took a chance. To my surprise, it was DELICIOUS, my husband loved it and so did I. Will make again & again VERY YUMMY!!!! :)

All my friends were disgusted when they heard what I was putting into the recipe:
they just could not believe this mix would ever work out. An hour later everybody 
was amazed and the dish was the first one to disappear at our potluck! :)
Easy to make with basic ingredients that are always at hand, this makes a perfect 
dish for a busy day but also an equally good one for a special occasion.

I made this last night for dinner, it was extremely easy and quick to prepare. I used boneless and skinless chicken breasts instead and baked it for 1/2 hour.  I made it with rice as others below suggested and drizzled the extra sauce over the rice. It was really tasty, although a little too much soy sauce for my taste.  Overall a good recipe that I will make again.

Absolutely wonderful.  Everyone raved about it.  I used chicken breasts - cut in half so they wouldn't be so thick - and it only took one half hour to bake.  They were moist and delicious.  I, too, made extra sauce and used it on rice.  THANK YOU.

A little too much soy sauce.  I added just a touch of bbq sauce to the mix.  I thought for sure that it wasn't going to turn out and then five minutes before done, they glazed!  This is a melt in your mouth kind of taste.  Yum

I use this recipe on my lazy nights when I don't
feel like taking a lot of time to make dinner.  
Instead of chicken wings, I use cut boneless 
chicken breasts. I pour the sauce on top and cook 
for 15-20 minutes and they are done.  They're always 
a hit!

This was a great recipe.  I used leg quarters for my cut of meat.  My husband loved this dish.  He ate two pieces at supper and then finished off the leftovers the day after!  Plus I looked real impressive while I mixed my sauce!

My two toughest critics, my husband and child, love this recipie. Fingers were licked with abandon. Unfortunately, there were no leftovers, but I bet those wings would be great cold. I even use the sauce on pork loin--delicious.

I tried this with boneless/skinless breasts...not sure I really liked it.  Flavor was mighty intense and sweet, but the breasts were too dry.  I may try this again with the wings..just to see if it affects the taste.  Would NOT do it again with breasts.

It was good, but just a little too sweet.  Next time I think I will try only 3/4 cup honey instead of the full cup.  Also, mine didn't carmelize, but was still good.  The only change was I used a cut up chicken instead.

This was the best chicken I have ever eaten.  My husband and I "fought" over the last piece.  I used boneless skinless chicken breasts because we are not big fans of wings.  Wow!  I can't wait to make it again!

This recipe was really good. My chicken started to carmalize right at the 1 hour mark...so i left it for 5-10 minutes longer. I suggest constantly basting the chicken throughout the hour. We will have it again

Usually I have to ask him if he likes something (and he doesn't have much of an opinion about food), but after taking a few bites of this, he said "this is really good", without my asking him anything.  This recipe is a keeper!  Definitely drain off most of the fat before the last 30 minutes or so of cooking, it will help the chicken carmelize.  This would be great with chicken wings for a party!

I fixed this recipe with thighs and breast meat.  Everyone in the family loved it, even my youngest daughter who is a very picky eater.

My family loved this. I made it with skinless thighs and drumsticks instead of wings. My four year old loved mixing up the sauce for me.

this recipe was great - i poured off the liquid and reduced it separately in another pan and poured the thickened sauce over the chicken. this made a really satisfying glaze.  better than finger lickin' good.  this was a saviour as i wanted a recipe for chicken legs to take to a picnic.  thank you for sharing.

Really,really good. I don't like to prepare wings,so my husband did that part. Also, I used half soy and half teriyaki sauces; baked the chicken without sauce for about half an hour to render the juices from the chicken,then added the sauce. It caramelized in an hour and five minutes.

I LOVE honey garlic wings that restaurants serve, but I never imagined that i would be able to make wings that are BETTER than the restaurant's!  These wings are delicious!...hint: try pouring off excess sauce near the end of the hour of baking to help caramelize the wings better!

This is very tasty!  I first tried it with chicken legs and it was great. So, I decided to try it with a bag of wings and drumettes.  Unfortunately, I didn't thaw the chicken first and it watered down the sauce too much so it didn't caramelize.  But they were still tasty!  Moral to the story:  use thawed chicken!!  Thanks for sharing!!

After reading the other member reviews I was very excited when the chicken DID caramelise!! I baked for about an hour on the lowest shelf, just above the oven's heating element. I also basted 3-4 times during cooking and added some chopped caramelised onion to the sauce to thicken. Very yummy, quite sweet, try adding some extra soy and more garlic.

I cant say enough good things about this recipie.  My entire family loves it and we are always sick of chicken.  I only had 4 chicken breast in the sauce, this allowed for "gravy" over the rice or pasta that goes with it.  Try it, you like it

Easy and wonderful recipe.  I've cooked them many times since last May, foil on the bottom makes the cleanup a breeze.  Also I experimented and cut down my soy sauce and spread pieces into two pans for about 15 minutes more to achieve carmelization.  Really great stuff!

YUM!!! This recipe is WONDERFUL!  I didn't have wings on hand, so I used a variety of chicken pieces instead.  My daughter liked it so much she had seconds.  My husband liked it so much he told my Mother-in-law about it and she wanted the recipe!  This will be one I cook frequently for my family.  It's great over a bed of white rice and with broccoli!

Great chicken.  My sauce didn't carmelize either, but I'm sure it's because I didn't wait long enough.  Very tasty.  Made it with chicken drummies..and we ate them til they were gone!

I've used this recipe twice with breasts instead of wings.  The flavor is very good, but like others, I couldn't get the sauce to carmelize.  That won't stop me from making them again, though, we enjoyed them very much.

Wonderful!!!  I may not have cooked long enough for sauce to caramelize, but it was still fantastic.  I used skinless chicken breasts instead.  

This is a "make again" recipe.  My 9 yo enjoyed it, but ruined it by adding her usual "A-1" topping.  (Yuck, but that's how they can be sometimes)  Thank you!!  :-)

My roommates can't get enough of these!  There are three of us, and there are never any leftovers.  The ingredients are inexpensive, and it is so easy and fast to do!  About  25 minutes into cooking, I flip the wings and baste them and they come out perfect every time.

I have made this a couple times the sauce never carmelized.  It didn't really matter, b/c the chicken still tasted good even though it was messy.  This time, I decided to follow another users advice and marinate the chicken wings overnight and then bake them the next day at 350 for 40 minutes on one side, and 275 for another 25 minutes on the other side.  Of all the times I have made this, this way tasted the best and the sauce actually carmelized.  From now on, this is the way I am going to make it.

Excellent, tasty sauce! Used legs and thighs. Mine didn't carmelize either. I just put the drippings in a pot and boiled it off for a few minutes to thicken it up. Served it with rice too. My husband RARELY raves about any meal. The only time he ever says anything, is when he doesn't like it. When I ask how it was, he usually will just say it was good. To him, food is food. But he couldn't stop saying how good this was. He even wanted to take the leftovers to work for lunch! My picky 3 year old daughter loved it too. I think I'll try a little bit more garlic though next time, maybe a pinch of ginger too.

My husband went CRAZY for this!  I used the Pick of the Chicken pack, so I had breasts, wings and legs.  I didn't have enough honey -- but it still came out perfect.  It got a nice glaze and the skin was crispy and delicious!!  I would cut back on the oil next time if I used the skinned chicken, was a bit too much grease but DELICIOUS!  Do yourself a favor - get the ingredients and try this one out!!!!

Loved this recipe!  I used leg quarters with the skin on so I skipped the oil.  It didn't carmelize for me, but was great nonetheless.  Leftovers the next day were even better.

We usually have to tell our daughter a dozen times in a meal to eat her food.  I made this and she not only ate it, she asked for more!!  My husband said he'd eat this all day if it were served at an all you can eat buffet.  Needless to say, we'll make it again.  I wonder if mine didn't caramelize either because I used creamed honey and perhaps liquid honey gives a different result.  The sauce would be fantastic over rice.  Sticky or not, it won't go to waste.  THANKS!!

This is a great, fast recipe for busy moms.  You can prepare it in advance and keep it in the fridge for awhile.  Then just put it in the oven 30 min. before dinner.

I substituted chicken tenders for the wings and made a honey mustard dipping sauce for our Superbowl Party.  That cut down tha fat content and kept the flavor.  It went over very well.  I feel better that mine was not the only one that didn't caramelize.  It was still very tasty.

I'm a mother of Triplets and a Wife, so things that are quick, easy and good are
paramount on my list when fixing dinners for my family.  This took me 15 minutes max.
I mixed the sauce in a blender and poured it from the blender on to my chicken breast 
and then chicken wings the next night.  It was an easy clean up as well.  Loved it.

The flavor is definitely good but the sauce never caramelized and it was a bit too greasy for our tastes.  Next time I make it, I will only use 1/2 cup of honey, add more garlic and pepper, leave out the oil and salt, skin the chicken (using thighs and drumsticks), and add some ginger and lemon juice.  My family loved it and my 4 yr old son is quite picky.  He asked me to make it again the next day!!

This was wonderful! I only had about 2 tbs of soy sauce so I mixed in 2 tbs of honey teriyaki barbeque sauce and a bit more honey.
then I mixed up some extra honey and the barbeque sauce to brush on a bit before cooking was done....I also removed the liquid from the pan about 15 minutes before the end, like suggested, to aid in carmelization... I think it really helped.... 
all in all, it was wonderfully flavorful and moist... we all enjoyed it! Thank you!

LOVED his recipe even though we changed it a little. We added pineapple near the end of the baking time, and while preparing it, we added a lot more garlic clove, 2 green onions and a 1/2 lemon squeezed over the chicken. We also added a little sesame oil with the soy sauce, and DID not put any salt in it because of the soy sauce already having that salty taste. This is great over rice or noodles and we used skinless chicken pieces. You can't go wrong with this recipe, although it never carmelized for us (could be all the changes we made) it is easy to make, fast to cook, and DELICIOUS! My son who is not a big fan of meat liked it. Definitley will make this again! Thanks!

i made this last night and i liked the taste, it could have been alittle sweeter, and i added more garlic than the recipe said. i took the advice of one of the reviewers and covered the dish and turned the chicken every 20 minutes but still the chicken didnt carmelize. i served it over rice, i would make it again!

I am a person who is notoriously known in my family for not knowing how to cook and my boyfriend is extremely picky about what he eats and is very hard to satisfy.When I made this recipe nobody could believe I'd made it.My boyfriend loved it!He said it was the best chicken he ever tasted and asked me to make it again the next day!The recipe was extremely easy to make.It didn't carmelize like some of the others but everyone loved it anyway.This recipe is definately worth trying it made me look like a pro!

Very good!  I cut this recipe in half and made it with drumsticks that I found on sale.  The sauce did carmelize and I basted several times throughout cooking.  Delicious over brown rice!

My whole family loves this recipe.  The first time I made it, I messed up & only used half the honey called for.  So I had to make it again the right way before I left my comments.  Both ways were good!!

This has a very good flavor.  However, it didn't carmelize.  It's worth trying again!

I used fresh bone-in chicken thighs and turned them 2 times while baking to coat the chicken as much as possible. The mixture did not carmelize as I hoped it would and remained thin like water however enough of the mixture was on the chicken to give it great taste and color. I prepared steamed white rice on the side; placed the chicken on a serving platter and served the remaining mixture in a serving bowl. The mixture was great on the rice. This recipe is really delicous. I will prepare this dish again for my family.

For whatever reason, the glaze didn't stick to my chicken very well.  What little did stick was very tasty though.  I'll certainly give it another try.

This is the best chicken I've ever had.  I used chicken breasts that were still frozen and they came out very moist and tender.  I have also tried it with pork and beef and it was just as good. I didn't have any honey so I used corn syrup, it worked out great.

My husband and I made this and we accidently put in 1 cup of soy sauce instead of 1/2 cup.  Of course it didn't carmelize, but it was great anyway.  We loved it and so did our guests.  Now we'll have to try it with the right recipe!

I was in a hurry and only had 1 hour to prepare a dinner for 6. I went through the recipes and found this one and was very pleased with it and it made a big hit.  Everyone wanted the recipe and I told them it was an old family favorite.

I tried it with thighs and it was great.  I think it would be good with wings.  Reminds me of Chinese wings.  Will definately try again.
