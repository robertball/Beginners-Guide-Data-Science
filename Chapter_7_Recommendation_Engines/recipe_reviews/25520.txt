I took this to a party and one person said she could eat it with a spoon. I used frozen whole shrimp, cooked it in a little butter with salt and pepper and then added it. I tripled the recipe. Didn't have time to let it chill for 45 minutes. Will try again.

Not bad, a little heavy on the onion but relatively light and a nice change.  Thanks Lisa!

This is really good!  I ran out of M. Whip (I know, it's a sin) so I used mayo and about 2 tsp. of brown sugar instead.  I also used onion powder (to taste) instead of the minced onion.  The flavors of the shrimp and curry blend perfectly.  The best part is how easy this recipe is to throw together.  Thanks for posting, Lisa!

This was okay, but not excellent. I'd probably modify this, but I would try it again.

This is good & definitely easy to make!  I've made it twice now & have had to add a lot more of the Miracle Whip so that it didn't seem too dry & would spread better.  First time I didn't have minced onion & used onion powder. I liked it better the 2nd time with the minced onion, but not a huge difference in taste.  Plus this got good reviews from the people at the party. THANK YOU!

I followed the recipe exactly, and I thought it was a little dry. I added about 2 T. sour cream, and that made it too bland. :-) I ended up adding more curry powder and a little hot sauce. It was okay, but I won't make it again. I'll bet it would be pretty in a mold, like a pate.
