I made it to the recipe, but rather than over rice I made it as an appetizer and served it on lettuce leaves as a wrap. Our guests loved it. I would make it again and serve it the same way.

I wrapped mine in flour tortillas and added shredded cabbage and made “tacos”. It was so good, and I garnished it with the red garlic chili sauce that I get at the Asian supermarket. I even forgot the rice, but it didn’t even matter. Quick, easy, and delicious!

Your busy weeknight needs this dish. Even your lazy Saturdays will be happy with it. My family devoured this. It’s so simple to make and it is super delicious and full of flavor. Leftovers warm easily, which is great when you’ve got teenage midnight grazers. 
The first time I made it, I served it over rice. Second time with rice noodles. The next time I make it I’ll take the advice of the other reviewer and serve as tacos with cabbage. Thank you for the awesome recipe.

I didn't have sesame oil, so I just used canola oil.  I also didn't have crushed red pepper so I sprinkles in some hot chili powder.  I substituted the rice for quinoa for the kids and cauliflower rice for adults.  This is a new family favorite!

Great, quick recipe that the whole family loved. I would probably cut some of the brown sugar next time and DEFINITELY use low salt soy sauce. I didn't have enough so I used some regular and it was pretty salty. Next time I'm going to try with coconut aminos. I also added some shredded carrots at the end to increase veggie content. Served with steamed rice. This one will go into our rotation!

I had also most every ingredient (I was missing green onions) but it was still very delicious I can’t wait to make this again and I’ll make sure I have green onions. This is now added to my family’s favorite meals to cook.

I was at the end of my menus, and was looking to make  something with pantry staples. I had a received an e-mail from Allrecipes with this recipe in it, so I decided to make it. The added bonus is I realized it's a recipe by my good friend b.d.weld!

This is a quick weeknight dinner.  It has a great flavor. I found it a little dry so I added some beef broth to it. I will definitely make it again.

Since recently coming back from Asia, I've been craving Bibimbap, so once I saw this beef recipe, I knew I must make it. I used this beef mixture in place of the meat in the 'Bibimbap (Korean Rice With Mixed Vegetables)' on this site. This beef mixture was so good and full of flavor. Then, when combined with the Bibimbap recipe, a delicious beef and vegetable meal was created. This was so delicious that my husband bragged about it for days. Thanks for such a great recipe!

I was looking for something different to  do with ground beef and was good.  Read the other reviews and decided to give this recipe a try and it was wonderful.  I use gluten free soy sauce which isn't low sodium.  The comments that said it was to salty when using regular soy sauce and it being to salty, i decided to cut the soy sauce in half and mix with water.  The  flavor of this dish was great

This was a good quick meal.  I found it way to sweet though, I will make it again but add  more than half the amount of brown sugar.   I did add some other veggies though to make it more of a meal.  Sauted some red peppers, mushrooms, bok choy and edamame . Maybe a good idea to add more liquid so you have sauce for the rice otherwise it could be a bit dry.

My family gave this 6 thumbs up. Very delicious, though I didn't use low sodium Soy sauce (don't have it) and it was fine. Scooped it over some jasmine rice and oh my my, it went off the plates very quickly! You might want to tone down the spice a bit though if you have family members that don't like it.

I had to use ground ginger and I omitted the red pepper flakes but only for my kids' sake. I served mine with broccoli, celery and carrots. I took leftovers to work and everyone in the office was begging for the recipe because it smelled so good. This meal was delicious!

I have to admit that I eyeballed the quantities when making this for one portion, probably using less soy than a strict division by 4 would have resulted in. I also cooked the rice along with the beef once the beef had been browned and seasoned, instead of serving the beef over plain steamed rice. Even with less soy, and reduced-sodium soy at that, plus the added water for the rice, the dish turned out a bit salty for my taste and the other flavors were a bit overpowered (except the sesame). I'm going to try it again, though, with a bit less soy, because the concept was good and I enjoyed the meal in spite of the saltiness. I may also throw in some vegetables, maybe zucchini or yellow squash coins , a handful or two of spinach or baby greens, or whatever comes to hand. On the whole then, I'd say this is a make-again with minor variations.

This is a MUST. Tried it tonight for the first time followed the exact instructions and added 1 1/2 tablespoons of Sambal Oelek Chili Paste and it was delicious! Served it over brown rice with peas. Please note, it’s best to use Low Sodium Soysauce. It has just the amount of salt needed. Definitely adding to my recipe book.

I followed the recipe and it was super easy to make.   Tasty but a little bit salty for our taste so I may adjust the soy sauce next time.  Will make them again.

This is so delicious!  DO use reduced sodium soya, I used regular as I didn't have any reduced on hand, and it was way to salty.  I doubled the marinade and used half to marinate and bake tofu with as my son is vegetarian.  I topped it with julienned carrots, cucumber and chopped red bell pepper.  So  easy and soooo good.

SO good!  I used white rice instead of brown-because that's what I  had in the fridge!  Also,  I wanted to give some tips...about "fresh ginger" , I keep my ginger in the freezer and simply take what I need as recipes call for it.  It'll keep for 6 months in the freezer!   about garlic, I use fresh and grate it on the same micro-planer as the ginger when I make this dish.

I followed this recipe except for doubling the sauce and halving the sugar based on other reviews.  My husband and I both liked it,  but our teen boys hated it. They aren't usually very picky. I am not sure what the issue was ... maybe the spices were just too different for their palate. We won't be making again.  Too bad!

Mostly because it was easy and different. Added cut onion, sliced carrots and green peas, which all added taste and color. Didn't use any red pepper and I served it with white jasmine rice. Yes, make again when you're rushed for time just make sure you throw in some extra veggies.

Salty, but very good

Made this for my family of six and the unanimous feedback was that it was salty, but please make it again. Used low sodium soy sauce. Will add vinegar next time.

Great with brown rice and side of broccoli.

We did put it in lettuce wraps and made a sauce with peanut butter and a little siracha sauce the whole family really enjoyed it. They asked if we could make it again soon.  Glad we tried it!

There was no depth of flavor with this recipe. It tasted of soy sauce and ginger rather than if a melding of flavors. I won't make it again.

Have a household that does not like spice so I omitted the red pepper.  I on the other hand like spice so used some Siracha in my serving and it was delicious. Tasting notes: If you omit the spice its a tad sweet so if doing a no spice version may want to limit the brown sugar a bit.  I also used some vegetable oil to brown the ground beef as the recipe did not specify to use anything for browning. Also did not have green onion so left it out and was still awesome.

This is addictive.   I only added half the sugar and I did actually substitute worcestire sauce for soy according to allrecipes substitution chart.  I’m sure it would be better with soy.  But this was such a fabulous base and new addition to my recipe rotation I had to give five stars.    I roasted broccoli and green beans and any veggie would do.   The green onions were a must.   Next time I will try peppers and cashews.

I reduced the amount of spices and brown sugar by about 1/4 and it was still very good! I also lined the bowls with lettuce before spooning the rice into the bowl. When getting down to the bottom of the bowl, the lettuce came in handy to put the remnants inside, creating a lettuce wrap to finish it off.  I garnished with the green onions and sesame seeds that the recipe called for and then I also garnished with sugar snap peas. My son and I both enjoyed making and eating it. We will definitely be making this again.

We enjoyed this recipe. I added mushrooms and water chestnuts. I also used mushroom flavored soy sauce instead of regular (and cut back a bit on the brown sugar) and it gave the recipe a deeper more complex flavor. Before adding the liquids I also sprinkled a bit of cornstarch on the browned ground beef and added a bit of broth to add a thicker sauce like quality to go over rice. Delicious!

Oh, bd., you did it again! Yummo, my friend! I made this for lunch as our DIL, Heather, was coming over for a visit. Perfection in flavors! I did double the sauce a/c I added julienned snow peas, shredded carrots, and Bella mushrooms. Topped with scallions and toasted sesame seeds. Served over jasmine rice and ate to our hearts content! Thank you, Brian! You're the BEST!

Delicious recipe and so easy to make! I made the recipe as written, but also added some sliced bell pepper that I needed to use up toward the end of cooking. Instead of rice, I followed the author's note and served this dish over zoodles. While we did thoroughly enjoy this meal, it was a little too sweet for us. Next time I would reduce the amount of brown sugar a little. Thanks for the recipe, bd.weld!

Delicious! Even my picky eaters ate a full bowl over rice. I’ll be making this again for sure! Thanks for the great recipe!

I just used the ingredients that I had on hand to make it. That included: chopped celery & yellow onion, minced garlic, basil, salt & pepper. I also used granulated sugar instead of brown sugar to help sweeten it (soy sauce) up. I had already chopped up the fresh veggies earlier so this helped to save even more time on an already quick & easy meal. I definitely plan on making this one again.

Amazing! I’d give it a 10 if I could! I used powdered ginger instead of fresh but it was incredible! It’ll be a regular in this house. I served mine over sweet peas and rice

Overall, pretty good.  I added some stir fried broccoli on the side to complete the dish.  I would make it again as it's a quick weeknight meal.  As written the recipe made just enough for the 2 of us with a small portion left over.

This is basically bulgogi ground beef style, definitely extremely good, put a fried egg and some steamed veggies on top to take it to the next level. I was worried about using full strength soy sauce, I never need to use low sodium so didn't want to go out of my way to buy some, it was a little strong I would probably use 1/4 cup normal soy sauce or 1/4 soy 1/4 water but it was still tolerable as is, especially mixed with rice, veggies, and the fried egg. I also didn't have fresh ginger (subbed 1/4 tsp dried ground) or the green onions so they were omitted. Will have to try making it to recipe later. Definitely a keeper, nice change from the usual Italian and Mexican ground beef dishes that we mostly have with ground beef!

Made it and loved it.  I wasn't in the mood for rice, so I subbed in ramen noodles. There are much healthier versions available.  I put a little less than 1 cup of water in the ramen (beef flovor) to tighten it up and added frozen broccoli to the beef mixture. It made a delicious bowl.

Easy and delicious.  A tad sweet for me so I will reduce the sugar a bit.  The leftover meat was great in lettuce leaves. I will make  a larger amount  next time  for a second meal.

I cannot say enough about this recipe! We loved it!  The beef had the flavors you would find in a bulgogi, but, it was super fast to put together and perfect for a weeknight meal.  I used jasmine rice instead of brown rice because that is what I had in the pantry.  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

This was delicious! My husband raved over it! I Doubled the recipe. I only had regular soy sauce so I added 1/4 cup regular total to a doubled recipe. I’m cutting down on sugar so I added only a third of a cup brown sugar to a double recipe. I added some extra crushed red pepper. I served it over coconut ginger rice and it was absolutely delicious! This recipe is going in the rotation. My husband will demand it lol.

I've made the recipe twice.  The first time with brown rice.  My husband liked it but said he prefers white rice.  The 2nd time I made it I cooked white rice and it went over well.  Excellent recipe.

Made this about 3xs now....delish! I would suggest using less soy sauce to cut down on the saltiness. I don’t use sesame seeds and add more garlic and ginger because it’s delicious! Quinoa or jasmine rice with a side salad and voila!

This is a great recipe. Very flavorful! I doubled everything and added chopped broccoli, carrots, celery and mushrooms. I also had some cabbage in the fridge so I shredded it and cooked it for a few minutes in some of the sauce that I spooned off the top. I layered jasmine rice, cabbage then the beef. Very pretty dish and so tasty! What a great alternative way to use ground beef.

This was super easy!  I’m bummed I didn’t try this recipe earlier.  It came out quite sweet for me, but that can be easily adjusted. Served with white rice and kimchi, it was great!  Love the idea to use in lettuce wraps and tacos!

Delicious and easy recipe the whole family enjoyed! I made it with low sodium soya sauce and decreased the sugar slightly - perfection! We ate it over rice with slivered carrots and cabbage over top. I would definitely make it again!

03/28/19: Made the first time per recipe instructions.  Pleasantly surprised I managed to get a nice Asian blend, given my cautious adjustments on the amount of ginger and soy sauce ( for increasing serving size, from 4 to  6 people ). I was also cautious with the ground red pepper amount--and got just the right light kiss of heat. Definitely will make again and experiment with some Asian ingredient additions.

My whole family really enjoyed this and I was thrilled with how quick and easy it was to make.  Yes, ground beef worked out beautifully but this recipe would work well with any beef that had been mostly cooked beforetime.  It has a spiciness that sneaks up on you but doesn't overwhelm everything else.  This dish is a matter of taste though, with some enjoying it as is and others saying the taste was too "strong."  I could almost see both sides so you will need to adjust your soy sauce and seasonings as you make it.  All in all, it gets 5 stars because I never thought I would find something of this nature SO simple to make.  I did serve it over the brown rice and it was excellent with it- the rice creates a buffer if you feel the taste is too strong.

Very easy. Very tasty. I used sweet onions, because I didn't have green onions. I cooked them before I browned the beef. Tasted nice. Will make this again.

This is really good and easy.  Its going I. The dinner rotation.  I served over Brazilian white rice from this website (my go-to for the past 6 mo or so), and next to sugar snap peas but love the idea of serving with lettuce too.  I cut the brown sugar to 1/4 c. and did a heaping 1/4 tsp. of red pepper flakes.  Delish!!

The Korean Beef was quick and very flavorful. We added cabbage and served with edamame. We will definitely try this recipe again.

I enjoyed it. I did not make the brown rice with it but I did make white rice a broccoli. It was a lil salty when eaten alone but with side it worked perfectly. I will not hesitate to make it again.

As some of the other reviews I added the shredded cabbage since I had some extra. I also realized too late that I was out of crushed red pepper and used chili powder. I cut back on the brown sugar by about 50% after reading one of the reviews. I also realized that I didn't have reduced sodium soy sauce so I used a packet of regular soy sauce and dumped it into about a half cup of water.  Since sodium is my kryptonite this worked for better than having it be too salty. I served with brown rice.  It appears that this recipe holds up to a variety of modifications and comes out quite nicely.  I will make it again.

Used less sugar (1/4 instead of 1/3). Added broccoli, carrots, red pepper & snap peas to the mix. The extra veggies added to the already great flavor! Highly recommend for a quick & healthy meal.

Easy, quick, tasty, and enjoyed by our family. Must be all the rage at the moment (trending, as they say) since I typed "ground beef recipes" and four entries on the top of the list were for Korean Ground Beef and Rice. A fifth recipe showed the similar Chinese-inspired dish Ground Beef and Broccoli. I did add the broccoli to this and wish I had added carrots as well. Popped rice in the rice cooker, fired up the skillet to cook the beef, added the sauce, added frozen broccoli and a cup of water to help it steam as the rice finished cooking. Very quick!

No changes made.  Except I didn't have green onions.  But my family all found it to be too strong.  I think if I cut all the seasonings in half it would be better.  But we had it with rice and lettuce to wrap it in.  That helped a bit.  If I make it again, I will cut the seasonings in half and we love really flavourful food.  But it was a bit overwhelming.  I did get more used to it as I ate it but definitely had to be mixed with other things to make it palatable. It was quick and easy to make.

Made this twice in the last 3 weeks. Super simple and quick - great for a fast family meal. My kids thought it was too sweet the first time, so I cut the sugar to a 1/4 cup. I also add mushrooms just before the meat is done cooking (keeping them in large pieces so my kids can pick them out). I also add diced carrot and broccoli florets and cook for a minute or two. My kids love the vegetables on the firm side. Garnishing is too fancy for us, so I add the green onion and throw in the sesame seeds at the last minute. It has turned out great both times.

This turned out great! Even my picky kids loved it!! They asked for this to be added to our weekly rotation.  We like spice, so I added a little chili paste for extra flavor and heat.

I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef to lower the fat content. I also added diced carrots for a little extra veggie oomph. Great flavor combo! This was definitely a family pleaser.

My husband liked it, so I will be making it again. My changes were to use 6 oz ground chuck (for 2 servings), adding 1/2 cup diced onion, and crystallized ginger.

This is a simple fast versatile dish. My husband I both loved it. I made a change to make this keto friendly by using a brown sugar substitute made from erythritol. I use grass fed beef to make it healthier. I added some peas to the dish too. This recipe will be in the recipe rotation schedule!

This was excellent. However I have a family of 5 with 3 boys. Next time I will be doubling the recipe. There was just barely enough for everyone, and my husband was still hungry later in the evening.

unfortunately my ginger root went bad so I used 2 teaspoons of powdered ginger and it was ok but I think fresh would be better. It was good and I will make it again.

This was so fun and easy. I made it for 8 people and it stretched really well. I'll definitely make it again.
