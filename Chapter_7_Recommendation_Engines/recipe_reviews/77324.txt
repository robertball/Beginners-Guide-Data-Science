I have used recipies from this site for years, yet this is the first time I have felt compelled to post a bad review.  If you do decide to try it beware of the eggs...there are WAY to many.

I make this recipe as a gluten-free alternative to pumpkin pie and really enjoy it.  I also reduce the eggs to 4 and it is much better!

I brought this dessert as an alternative to pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving dinner and got rave reviews from everyone.  The nut topping was delicious and the scoop of whip cream on each piece topped it off beautifully!
