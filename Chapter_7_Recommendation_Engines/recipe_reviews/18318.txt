Experienced cooks will know, without reading the submitter's review and clarification, that this recipe has some problems. For inexperienced cooks, it's no wonder they didn't care for this if they prepared it as the recipe is written, with its excessive amounts of butter and olive oil, and the direction to saute the garlic over such high heat. If made correctly, you will simply drizzle a bit of olive oil in a pan, add a little butter, saute the asparagus until crisp tender, and add the garlic at the very end after lowering the heat.  This is a simple,delicious and classic method of preparing many vegetables in addition to asparagus, worthy of five stars if prepared with the necessary modifications.

This is my recipe. They changed the amounts for the ingredients. Use at least a pound of asparagus for the amount of butter and oil in the recipe. Cut down the butter to one to two tablespoons if you're only using 1/2 lb. of asparagus. I also use this recipe with fresh green beans. Yum!

Making this recipe was the first time ever tried asparagus.  Now, I can't eat it any way but like this.  I serve this with dinner at least twice a week.  I don't use fresh garlic, I used jarred cushed or minced garlic (whatever is in the fridge).  I use two teaspons (hey - I like garlic).  If you do this, add the garlic in at the end of the cooking time as the garlic would burn if you added it in at the beginning as the recipe calls for you to do with fresh garlic cloves.

I have not eaten asparagus in years, but it was on sale today, so I bought a package and tried this recipe for dinner tonight.   After reading the reviews, I made some of the changes that were suggested and it turned out so good that I wish I had made double the amount!  First I melted just 2 Tbsp of butter, then added sliced mushrooms and cooked them for a few minutes before adding the asparagus so it wouldn't get overcooked because I like it crisp.  Then I drizzled just a little olive oil over the vegetables.  I substituted garlic salt for the coarse salt and garlic cloves because so many people said this was too salty and/or the garlic burned.  I also used lemon pepper instead of regular black pepper and sprinkled a little lemon juice over the vegetables while they were cooking.  After I took them out of the pan, I sprinkled fresh parmesan cheese over them.   This was the best asparagus I have ever eaten!

Snaps for Kim! We loved this recipe. Asparagus can be bitter if not prepared properly which could be why so many don't like it. This was so simple and the flavor was terrific. I didn't add the garlic until the last few minutes so it didn't burn and I used 2 Tbls. of butter with 1 Tbls. olive oil for 1 lb. of asparagus. When the color starts to just fade its done. Great recipe.

The only reason this gets 4 stars is because my boyfriend says this was just "ok".  I absolutely loved it.  (He doesn't care for asparagus.)  A tip you can use with asparagus: don't just cut off the end.  "Bend" the asparagus until it breaks naturally.  Asparagus will break where it is most tender.  That way you don't have to mess with the hard and chewy ends.  You can also peel the asparagus but I think that's too much work.

When I saw the amount of butter/olive oil this dish called for I was really turned off, so I adjusted the recipe by using l tablespoon of olive oil and butter flavored cooking spray. It was really delicious.

I've never cooked asparagus before, and only eaten it once before so I was not hopeful about it, but I have to say, this was simply delicious.  We had Mahi mahi and brown rice with it, and I added some lemon juice to the leftover garlicky butter from the pan as a dipping sauce.  Many happy groans of delight.  One thing however, I didn't have fresh garlic, so I used garlic powder that first time.  I've made it since with the fresh - but honestly there isn't That much difference between the two.  Both great. (Powder is easier actually.)

Yum....and that's from someone who has never liked asparagus.  I had a bit of a problem fitting it in the frying pan and trying to make sure it cooked evenly. Finally, I just took a knife to the spears and cut each one in half so I could stir them around easier. Next time I will have to drag out my HUMONGOUS frying pan so I can keep the spears whole. I'm not sure what size pan you other folks are using, but I had my hands full....but since I've never cooked asparagus before, it's probably just my lack of expertise. I agree with some other reviews about cutting back on the butter and even the salt (this is coming from a salt lover). You can add more salt at the table if you feel it needs it.

This is absolutely delicious.  We are a garlic  loving family, and so I doubled up on the garlic cloves and didn't use quite as much butter as called for.  The asparagus had a garlic infused taste and stayed crunchy well after it was done cooking.  I gave it a hefty dose of salt and served it over rice along with the Firecracker Salmon recipe also found on the site.  Will definitely be making again.  Thanks a bunch Kim!!

I've been using this recipe for several years now and it's my favorite way of cooking asparagus.  I can't give this 5 stars, because I don't think it would be very good as written.  It has way too much oil and butter and the garlic is added too soon.  The way I make it is to use only about 1 Tbsp. each of the olive oil and butter.  I add 1/4 tsp fresh ground black pepper and a couple pinches of kosher salt.  I cook the asparagus in this and add the garlic during the last 1-2 minutes of cooking.  If you add the garlic at the beginning, it will get way too brown!

Fabulous!!!!! Added some fresh lemon juice as well as shredded parmesan cheese on top. Wow! Great flavor. Went well with the herb and spice rubbed beef tenderloin that I made. Will make asparagus like this from now on.

Excellent recipe with a few modifications. Just drizzle a little oil and cut the butter in half. I also add my fresh garlic near the end just to get the flavor but not overcook the garlic. I find it amazing how so few ingredients can make something so amazing! Plus it was so easy!

Delicious! Perfect texture - not too soft but not too hard. I to melted 2 tbs of butter and about 1.5 tbs olive oil. Added in the salt and pepper. Sauteed for a minute. Added trimmed asparagus and cooked for about 9 minutes. Added 3 cloves of freshly minced garlic and cooked for another 3 min or so. My husband was in love! So good! Don't know if I will be able to cook asparagus any other way now

Halved the oil and butter and it was plenty, decreased the salt to about 3/4 teaspoon also used three very large garlic cloves that I minced and added at the end.  So simple and perfect!

Very good, but as other reviewers have stated, the suggested cooking time is too long and your garlic will burn if incorporated at the beginning. On a medium high heat, your asparagus will be ready in about 5 or 6 minutes. I added the minced garlic (from a jar) in the last 2 minutes of cooking.

Very good with asparagus or green beans!  I little butter and EVOO in the pan.  Add your veg and saute for ~5 min at medium high.  Lower the heat to low and add your garlic to finish.

This is our favorite way to fix asparagus, and so easy! I throw 1/2 stick of butter in the pan, a drizzle of olive oil and my garlic. After the butter melts, add the asparagus and let it saute till done, stirring often. I love that the asparagus stays a little crisp instead of overcooking to the mushy stage. I use the McCormick sea salt grinder and don't measure the salt, just season to taste. Also, I cut the asparagus into 2 inch pieces, it's much easier to cook and stir that way. I use lots more asparagus than this recipe calls for.

A bunch of comments, as this is my first review of the first recipe I tried on this site.

First, despite my mistakes, the recipe turned out QUITE tasty, which is impressive in and of itself. (It was a nice compliment to my BBQ salmon fillet, marinated in lemon juice w/ salt & pepper.)

Some tips:
- do NOT use canned asparagus as I did -- mine turned out more mushy than crisp/tender. (I ended up only cooking it for 5 minutes, as I suspected it would become soup if I let it go the full 10.)
- know your stove/pan; med-high on my electric range was way too much heat, resulting in burnt butter and garlic.

I look forward to trying this recipe again w/ fresh ingredients and lower heat. Thanks Kim! :)

Finally,

this recipie was really good.  I cut oil and butter in half and only put about 1/8tsp of salt.  Next time I think I'll put in even less oil, so its not so greasy.

Way too much butter. They were like wet noodles. There's really nothing special about this recipe. I've had better tasting asparagus by just spraying the pan and sprinkling the spears with a little salt.

We just broil our asparagus with a little olive oil and salt and pepper for 5 minutes and have been doing so for years with great success. It's an Easter favorite.

my new favorite way to cook asparagus!  Used twice as much asparagus (guests) but kept to same amount of other ingredients. Dusted w/parm before serving. Everyone who liked asparaguse loved it prepared this way.  Also, cut into bite-size pieces before cooking -easy to saute this way. Thanks!

This is one of the best recipes I've run across except one thing . . . way too salty . . .I cut the salt in half and it was heavenly . . . I also used the same sautee mix on red potatoes and it was even better than the asparagus!

Bake trimmed (broken off the ends) asparagus in 
heavy pan (cast iron) after sprinklin with olive oil or lemon infused olive oil at 375 degrees.  Bake for 18 minutes in pre-heated oven.  Stalks will still be crunchy, but done.   Size doesn't really matter.  
Heavenly with lemon infused olive oil.   Do same recipe on grill.   Break stalks -tough part will be gone, what is left is the best.  Easy!

You really don't need to add all of those calories from the fat.  We just broil our asparagus with a little olive oil and salt and pepper for 5 minutes and it's amazing!

I thought the butter seemed too much when I read this, as well as the oil.  So I only used a little bit of each as suggested, cut mine into smaller pieces to help cook it more evenly, and it was great.  I served mine over some ziti, tomato sauce, and fresh mozzarella.  Superb :-)

A fast & easy side dish.  I modified the recipe using 3 Tbs. each of butter & olive oil, 1/2 tsp. salt & 1/8 tsp. black pepper.  The first time I made it, the garlic browned too much by the time the asparagus was cooked so I reduced the heat to medium and only sauteed the garlic for 10-20 seconds the second time before adding the asparagus.  The results were much better with those changes.

I have absolutely no argument with the ingredients but the amounts and method are iffy. WAY to much grease. WAY WAY to much grease.   I would use no more than 3 tablespoons of grease. 2 of olive and 1 of butter or however else you prefer. If you like your garlic add it about 2 minutes before you remove the asparagus from the heat. Allows for a more intense flavour and supposedly it doesn't cook the healthiness out of the garlic :). I cooked my asparagus for 6 minutes and it was ALMOST over done. As soon as they turn the gorgeous bright green, check it for your desired done-ness....this can be anywhere between 3-8 minutes. I would probably stop at 5.  Otherwise, enjoy!

Great tasting.  You can cut butter/oil a bit and it will still turn out really well.  Cut the heat as soon as the asparagus is crisp tender or it will get too soggy.  Topped with fresh shredded parmesan.  Thanks for this Kim.

Our's didn't turn out so well but I can only fault the wording of the recipe.  My girlfriend cooked as I was busy with other holiday cooking chores and she hasn't the experience I have.  At any rate, my recommendation is to change the second sentence to:  Cook garlic in butter for a minute, but do not brown - then remove garlic! There is no way possible to cook this dish on med-high heat without burning the garlic which I suspect is what happened to those who weren't pleased with the result.  Somewhat less salt also is recommended but that's my taste (we use salt sparingly usually).  Otherwise, it was good and I'm sure even better if cooked correctly.

This is an exceptional recipe however I think it calls for way too much salt. My asparagus was very salty. I will make this again however I will use 1 teaspoon salt instead of 1 tablespoon.

With the recommended changes (adding the garlic in the end, primarily so it doesn't burn and I used about a tablespoon of oil and 2 tablespoons of butter for a full pound of asparagus. More than that would have been WAY over the top, for me.) very tasty. Works on a LOT of different types vegetables. Green beans, brussel sprouts, etc. Just adjust the sauteing time for whatever you are throwing in the pan ;)

I love asparagus and I love it even more when it's cooked this way! For a little extra zing I like to sprinkle lemon-pepper over it right before I serve it.

This is pretty much the way I make my asparagus now.  Rather than leaving it whole, I cut it up and stir-fry it.  Thanks for a good basic recipe and clarifications.

I forgot the garlic and it was still good. Followed other reviews to heat olive oil then add a little butter with the veggies. When done seasoned w/ s&p.

This tasted wonderful.  I backed off on the garlic a little bit the second time I made it, because it was a little too strong in the first batch.

This was great! Until now the only way I prepared asparagus was to roast it. Now I have a new way and the picky eaters loved it like this. Thanks.

What a disaster! I'm sure this recipe would have been good....but my husband sauteed the garlic first, then added the asparagus. The garlic burned before the asparagus was fully cooked, so we pulled it off the stove. We ended up with undercooked asparagus that tasted like burnt garlic! Ew!

Great flavor, but very greasy. I guess your trading flavor for healthy  -- unless your on the low carb diet:) I sprinkled alittle parmesan cheese on it before serving.  Really good.

Good taste.  Only need a fraction of the butter/oil.  Garlic should definitely be added at the end to avoid burning.

Excellent flavor, easy too! Tastes like restaurant asparagus, but I used 2 T butter as suggested and could have used less. Also, a little salty-will cut salt to 1/2 tsp next time. Will make again for sure-thanks!

Best Asparagus I ever made! It was so good that my husband actually ate his entire serving before touching his chicken. Quick! Easy!

I used frozen asparagus from Schwan's. It cooked up a little quicker than the recipe says.

This asparagus is great - we love the crunchy bits of garlic!  This is a standard for Easter for several years now.  We try and squeeze it in a couple more times during the spring, we love it so much.  The more you "brown" the asparagus, the tastier.

Very good. I didn't have garlic, so I subbed garlic powder. Cooked a little longer (4 mins) more because my spears were thick. Good flavor. Will make again. Thanks!

Pretty darn good!  However, I did change it!  I skipped the butter altogether and just used a drizzle of olive oil!  Then at the end, when I take the pan off the heat, I add a little fresh Parmesan Cheese mix it around in the warm pan.  YUM!

I agree with many of the raters.  We pan fry asparagus all the time and use 1 scant tablespoon olive oil and very little garlic with one pound of the vegetable. We find no need to use butter for this vegetable while cooking it.  I start a cold pan with the oil and asparagus using the time it takes to warm the vegetable to allow the oil to coat it.  And I don't have to use a cover.  Just use a flat spatula to move the spears tendlerly, and they'll turn out great over medium to medium high heat in about eight minutes.

I loved this.  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly except I squeezed a little lemon juice on right before serving.  It was delicious. Even my 3 little boys loved it!

As written, this recipe has way too much butter.  I recommend what another reviewer did: sautee the asparagus in just a bit of butter and then put it on the pan and just drizzle a bit of olive oil over it.  Do not use 1/4 cup of butter.  That is just excessive.  If you reduce the butter way down to about a tablespoon, this will be great.

as other users suggested, i cut down on the butter to 2 T and only sauteed them for about 7 minutes, adding the garlic during the last 2 minutes.  this was supposed to be an appetizer for a family gathering, but my mom and i ended up eating everything ourselves!  and i thought i hated asparagus...

I fixed this recipe earlier this week and thought it was delicious!  I did cut back on the oil and butter.  I planned to add about a teaspoon of garlic powder when I put in the salt and pepper.  I made a mistake and grabbed the onion powder instead.  What a tasty mistake!  With the minced garlic I added the last few minutes of cooking all the flavors were wonderful!  I will ‘accidentally” put in onion powder from now on.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe got me eating asparagus again! I had so much asparagus growing up, I burnt out on it. This simple, yet tasty recipe really enhances the flavor of the asparagus. My husband & son didn't care for asparagus before either, but love it prepared this way. Note: I think the recipe should be 1 lb. of asparagus BEFORE TRIMMING. After you trimming it will equal about 1/2 lb. I think that may be where the other reviewers had a problem. Thanks Kim for a great recipe!

We love this recipe!!  We make a "boat" out of foil & combine the ingredients and cook it on the grill.  It is so easy to prepare and tastes great cooked on the stove or grill!!  I made it for several cookouts & everyone wanted the recipe!

This was delicious, and I'll make it again, but I wish I'd read Kimmy Rae's review before I made it because it was waaaaaay too much butter.  I served it to guests, and was a little unhappy with the big pool of butter in the bottom of the serving dish - I didn't want to drain the oil and butter off and risk losing the flavor, but it wasn't pretty.  I'll definitely make it again, but probably with half as much butter.

OMGOSH!! Fabulous and FLAVORFUL! Here's my take on this recipe.  I kept ALL ingredient amounts the same (including the butter) BUT BUT...BUT I DOUBLED the asparagus amount.  I cut the spears into 3rds on the diagonal for easier turning. I took a few readers advice and I only fried it for approx 4 min. I had really fat asparagus so if you have thin delicate stalks reduce that time. After frying for the 4 min I pulled the pan off the burner, covered it and let cool sitting on the stove.  It was PERFECTLY crisp tender  It's even great cold!  Thanks to the readers who suggested the shorter frying time, and letting it sweat to crisp tender under cover. I think it's the key to success with this recipe.  Can't WAIT to whip this dish on company with some BBQ steak, and French bread!

Some of the best asparagus we've had.  So easy and no need to add extra butter or sauce.  hope to be able to make this again before the asparagus is gone from the stores.  I did put a lid on the pan to ensure it steamed through, and only cooked it about 7 minutes.

I use a whole head of garlic (we love garlic) and sautee with sliced shallots.  For those who have never cooked asparagus before, use a fork to pierce it and check for doneness  It should be tender, but firm.  Also, thin asparagus cooks much quicker than the thicker spears.

I would not try this recipe again.  The asparagus was limp and tasteless after adding additional garlic.  I was quite disappointed as we really like asparagus.

WOW!!!! Me and my better half rate this a 10 out of 5 ;-). Amazing flavour with the garlic! I did however cook everything on medium low so the garlic didnt burn. This is our main asparagus recipe from now on. Thanks so much for sharing!

This was extremely salty! I used kosher salt and I didn't even use all the salt called for! Also, it was a ton of butter and oil. Just grilling or steaming--even boiling it is easier and much tastier.

I prepared these this weekend and they were very tasty, but VERY greasy. The asparagus literally swam in the butter and olive oil. My five year old daughter actually liked them (she has a very sophisticated appetite for someone her age anyway) and so did everyone else. Next time, I will definitely cut back on the fat.

I LOVE asparagus and I LOVE this recipe!  The coarse salt (I used Margarita salt) really makes this dish unique.  I buy asparagus now, just so I can make this side dish!

This was fabulous!  My husband and I had not had asperagus since we were kids and didn't like it then, but I wanted something different for dinner and thought I would give this recipe a go.  It was amazing!  Even our 11 year old foster child loved it after saying he hated asperagus!!!  I added a little merlot and a touch of brandy to the cooking process, and it just swam with flavour.  We were all looking for more to put on our plates....guess I'll have to make bigger helpings next time! Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe was excellent.  The asparagus was full of flavor and my husband loved it.  I doubled the amount of garlic and cut the asparagus into smaller pieces.  I had to saute it for about 20 minutes to get it tender.  It was delicious!

I loved it!  For the people who are complaining about the amount of butter or olive oil, please keep in mind that people who are on the Low Carb, High Fat diet need to meet certain fat requirements in their daily diet.  There's nothing wrong with cutting back on the amount of oil or butter if that's not a part of your diet, but for us LCHF people, this recipe is perfect!

Delicious! You can cut down on the amount of butter and still really enjoy this dish. If you are very sensitive to salt, you may want to reduce that a bit as well.

I've never been a big asparagus fan, but after using this recipe last week, I bought more asparagus to make it again tonight.  I cut back on oil and butter slightly cause I'm always watching my weight, but it was delicious. Thanks.

Tried this evening...should have cut more oil/butter as it ended up being too much. Liked the flavor. Will try again and cut oil/butter more.

I really loved this.  I grew up with my family growing asparagus.  My husband is not a real fan of it but loved this and he ate most of the pan!  As other reviewers suggested, I cut the butter and oil in half.  I waited until the end to add the garlic.  In addition, I sprinkled some lemon juice over the asparagus. YUM!!!!

I echo all others and agree to cut way back on the olive oil & butter.  Just a drizzle of olive oil & maybe a teaspoon of butter.  Very good...I added red onion and then feta at the very end.

As written this recipe calls for way way too much butter and olive oil... i cut the butter back to a tablespoon and just drizzled enough olive oil as I thought it needed... and it still seemed like an awful lot... good flavor though... next time i might try cutting back a little more... also i followed another reviewers advice and added the garlic when the asparagus started to become tender.... yet another way to make asparagus... love it...

I followed recipe exactly and giving 5 stars. Even though I will cut back on the garlic, butter and Olive oil NEXT time, my husband made himself sick eating these things. (not really) its one of those recipes that has a bit much ingredient but can't stop eating it, nonetheless. I probably should mention that this is my very first time ever attempting cooking asparagus and even buying it so I'm no asparagus tasting pro. If you love garlic and butter....perfect! Otherwise, try using less when you make this and add to taste.

This is now the ONLY way I prepare asparagus. Love, love, love the intense butter/garlic flavor. Once it's done cooking, I put the asparagus on a serving plate & drizzle the remaining butter/oil over the top. Heaven!!

I made this recipe for Easter dinner. I followed naples34102 and LUVMYCAT"s suggestions and cut down on the butter and olive oil, used garlic salt and a little lemon juice. I also added mushrooms and offered Parmesan cheese. I cooked it a little longer than I should have, but the taste was great. I used less than a pound of asparagus, but I will make it again with more next time.

I have never liked asparagus before, neither has my boyfriend.  We picked some up to try it again, you know, give it another shot.  This was wonderful.  I did double the amount of garlic, but that is because we are garlic-aholics.  I also added one finely minced shallot.  At the end I added about a quarter cup of Italian style bread crumbs because there was a lot of butter in the bottom of the pan.  I served this with the mustard crusted tilapia from this site and it was a wonderful meal.  The bread crumbs really added a nutty sop up the butter sauce goodness you shouldn't miss.

This recipe was really really quick and easy to follow. I did cut the butter back by about half and only used about a tbs of olive oil. Also, I didn't put the garlic in until about 1 minute before it was done cooking. Next time I make this I will double up on the asparagus as this recipe only makes about 2 servings. My wife and I both loved it.

These were pretty good. Not bursting with flavor like i was looking for. Oh well, still good with no left-overs. I would like to find a recipe thats delish without using so much butter or fat.

This is a great way to do fresh asparagus! 
If you want to omit the butter, toss the spears in olive oil then salt and lots of fresh ground black pepper. Then lay them on a hot BBQ and turn the spears frequently until evenly charred!
Yum!

This was excellent - as long as you either use 2 pounds of asparagus or less butter/oil.  The ratio as it is is a bit much..  I added the garlic about 5 minutes after the asparagus was in so it wouldn't burn.  VERY tasty dish!!

Although this was a wonderful recipe, I still think that i like asparagus roasted in the oven better. This is a good one to have on hand for something different, though.

My husband and kids loved this recipe. We made it with fresh green beans and there were no leftovers! If you switch to green beans it will take less cooking time and a bit less oil and butter. Otherwise it will get soggy and very greasy

I thought that this recipe was fabulous!  It was so tasty!  I covered the pan when the veggies were sauteeing so the butter could carmalize the asparagus (and I also added green beans).  Watch the garlic doesn't blacken though, because this happened to me very easily... still fantastic though! Thanks!

Delicious! I halved the butter and oil and it was still very tasty. I made it with grilled salmon and it was the perfect accompaniment. Thanks, Kim, for a great recipe!

The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is the fat content.  To me, a side dish (esp. a VEGGIE side dish) shouldn't have 18 grams of fat!!  That said...this is SO good!  I will only make it on occasion, but rest assured, I WILL continue to make it!!  This is  my favorite way to make asparagus...  UPDATE:  This has become my Thanksgiving-day veggie side dish.  Everyone always loves it, and it's SO easy to make that I have no problem getting my boyfriend in the kitchen to make it.  (One less thing for me to do on the big day...)  We make this anytime we're looking to "class up" a meal -- I'm pretty sure my boyfriend would eat it every day if he could...

Just great!  The garlic is perfect in it.  Reminded me of the "Lemon Pepper Shrimp with Mustard" recipe from this site.  My spouse does not care for asparagus, so I made this with broccoli the next day and she really enjoyed it!  The butter was not a huge problem...I actually reduced it by half and then added some to it as it was cooking so as not to overcook the garlic.  Very good and thanx!

Simple elegant side dish and so quick to make.  I did omit the butter just to make the recipe a little healthier, with EVOO (extra virgin olive oil)...who needs butter.  I would also recommend using fresh ground black pepper, and roasted minced garlic!

This was really good but WHY all of the butter? I substiuted the butter for margarine but the next time I make this I will greatly reduce the margarine and maybe only use 1 tbl spoon. I seriously dont think you will miss the butter if you reduce it....

Adds good flavor and texture to asparagus. Easy to make. Did cut down butter and oil by about 1/4 each. Didn't find it overly greasy.

I am not an asparagus fan, so this rating is from my husband.  He liked it, but then added some parmesean cheese because he said there wasn't a whole lot of flavor.  According to him, the cheese gives it just what it needs.  All is well that ends well, thanks for the post.

Wonderful recipe!  So easy to throw together for such a delicious side dish!  I've made it twice so far and will definitely be cooking this regularly (especially now that asparagus is in season!)  Fantastic with grilled sirloin steak and steamed mini new potatoes.

I made this last night and it was delicious.  I've never made asparagus before and I think I overcooked it a little bit, but the flavors were wonderful.  I enjoyed it immensely and ate it as a side dish to grilled tilapia.  Thanks for sharing.

Although this had a good flavor, it was greasy and oily to me.  Way too much oil/butter!  I will probably try again in nonstick skillet without all the fat.

This was a bit disappointing. I added lemon pepper at the end, which jazzed it up a bit, but otherwise, they were too oily and there wasn't enough flavor.

This is a very yummy dish - once i made modifications. There is no way you should use this much butter - you just want enough for the flavor. I also use a bit more garlic. Additionally, i cook the veggies for a shorter time - i prefer my veggies "al dente" (true Italian style!) - this also means that my asparagus is not mushy and brown - it is bright green and lovely!

I also cut the butter, oil, and the salt in half. Using 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I found that if you use the coarse salt, you should use less.  You can always add more.  Had a little trouble at the end with garlic.  The garlic will brown easily. This will be asparagus recipe from now on.

I, too, cut some of the oil and butter and added just short of a teaspoon of salt, and this was delicious!  A great sidedish to salmon fillets.

I never made it except steamed with butter. This looked smart. Only additionally I added a bit of gruyere cheese at the end to melt and crisp around them. I used the very narrow ones not thick stalks too. Dang! This was gone! Mom never tasted so good. Now I need to go to the store for more asparagus. :(

I prepared one package of asparagus, snapping off the ends to trim down. I followed all directions as written and at the end, when they were bright green and just firm/soft I turned the heat up for a minute to high to brown them. Don't turn your back if you do this! They will burn very quickly. When serving, I sprinkled them with shaved fresh parmesan.

I have played around making asparagus several ways. This WINS. This will be how I make asparagus from now on.  Made according to directions except with my thin spears it did not take but 5 min to cook. I also just eyed the ingredient amounts- does not have to be perfect.

Good / not great recipe. Substitute lemon for salt if you are on a low sodium diet.

Cut back on the garlic and butter and it'd taste a lot better. Also I cook this at a lower temp for longer.

Good, easy, simple recipe. A few thoughts:

1. Be sure to trim the ends off the asparagus before cooking.

2. I'd try it with only half the salt.

3. The smaller shoots don't take as long to cook.

This was fantastic - and I usually don't like asparagus!  I was looking for a good recipe because my husband likes it so much, and I will be making this again. This is similar to how I fry up my green beans, so I'll be making them this way as well.

I made this with extra garlic and baby asparagus for my sweethearts birthday-it accompanied the dry brined pan seared pork and baked yams for a perfect meal met with ooh's and awes! Even the kids asked for more of this simple tasty side.

We love this asparagus recipe... it is easy and so good!  We used with Kosher salt but it was too salty that way, we like it better with small salt pieces.  This is a great recipe!

I used EVOO & butter in equal amts. And it came out better. Too much butter like the other reviwer said. And I added the garlic towards the end of cooking. Added a large baked tomato in the center for color & decoration

After reading many of the helpful reviews, I decided to keep the stated amounts of the butter, olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic, but used 2.25 pounds of asparagus.  It was really good, but I could've used even less butter and oil and it still would have tasted good.  I added the garlic at 9 minutes of cooking.  Sprinkled with approximately a teaspoon of feta cheese at very end.

I followed a revised method but used the ingredients listed n it was a hit! Especially since this is our first time eating asparagus. Just wish I didn't over crisp the first few - still turned out great ;).

I made it with about half the butter and no oil, and it was amazing!  My asparagus spears were thin and tender and didn't need to cook the whole 10 minutes.

This is my new favorite way to prepare asparagus.  Even the boyfriend, who isn't a big asparagus lover, went back for seconds.  Will definitley double the recipe next time as this made closer to 2 servings than 4.

This had great flavor, but I was really glad that I cut back on the butter and oil by half - that was plenty. When it was all said and done, my garlic had become little crunchy bits that were delicious to eat on the side. Great way to make asparagus!

Really enjoyed this but wish I wouldn't have cooked the entire 10 minutes and it was a little too buttery and I love butter.  I like how the garlic was nicely roasted and crunchy at the end.  Yummy - thanks.

Nice flavour and an easy recipe to put together.  Meant to serve with lemon garlic butter, but forgot.  Was still really good served with garlic mashed potatoes and bacon wrapped pork medallions.

Very basic ingredients with outstanding flavor.  The boyfriend commented on how good it was.  Since asparagus is his favorite, I had to give this recipe 5 stars.

This was delicious! I have made this recipe twice and was very pleased both times! I did find that ten minutes is MUCH too long to cook asparagus unless you like it mushy. 3 minutes of sauteeing seemed to be perfect!

Super easy and very tasty! I have made this side-dish many times, and would give it five stars, except that I tend to halve the amount of butter called for in the recipe. I don't think it requires that much, but that's just me. Sometimes I like to add a touch of balsamic or a squirt of lemon too.

This was a nice, basic recipe. I would cut down the butter to at least 2 tbs. and save the garlic (if it's not fresh) till about 2 minutes before the end.

Awesome! I am so used to plain steamed asparagus, I didn't realize I could have been eating them this way all along! :) I did not use any butter at all, and it was plenty oily enough. Did everything else as recipe called for. This went beautifully with boiled baby red potatoes, and Shoyu Chicken from this site.

So easy and so stinkin' good! I used a couple tablespoons of butter and eyeball the salt. The recipe calls for way too much salt. I also added the minced garlic about a minute before the asparagus is done. Don't overcook! Should only take about 7 minutes total. Nobody likes saugy asparagus.

EXCELLENT dish.  I never thought to add the salt and pepper to the butter/oil before adding the asparagus.  It gave a great seasoned coating to the asparagus when I mixed it in.  Added the garlic towards the end.  Only needed to cook the asparagus a few minutes, maybe 3-5, (but I prefer it very crisp).  DELICIOUS and easy. Will definitely make my asparagus this way in the future. Even the kids gobbled it up.

OMGosh! We love these asparagus. My only suggestion is to make these just before you're going to serve your meal because if they wilt they tend to be very greasy.

This was awesome.  I made a few changes, I used butter flavored cooking spray instead of butter, 1 T olive oil instead of 2 T and I added a little garlic at the end.  It was phenomenal!!!

OK recipe, but it took me 15 minutes prep time (not 5), and I used just one tablespoon of butter instead of 4, and it was plenty greasy.  Cooked on natural gas for 20 minutes, and it was still too raw, but the rest of dinner was getting cold. Oh well. I think just steaming in the microwave is easiest and healthiest with less pots and utinsels and time involved.

This recipe has quickly become my favorite way to cook asparagus.  I used minced garlic as I didn't have any fresh on hand and drizzled with a bit of balsamic vinegar to finish it off.  Yummy!

I love asparagus, so I was really excited to try this recipe.  Unfortunately, it didn't turn out quite right.  I followed the directions to use a full pound of asparagus, but it was still to oily and too salty.  I may try this again, but i will definitely cut down on both the oil and salt.

My husband could not get enough!  Used closer to a pound of asparagus and only half of the butter.  Tasted great, I will be making this again!

I don't think I'll ever cook asparagus any other way.  I used frozen aspargus that I thawed (I figured it would be fresher than the fresh at my store and it cost about the same).  Everyone loved it cooked this way.  It was flavorful and just tender enough.  Hooray!  Another one to add to my favorites list.

I have never cooked asparagus before. It tasted great. I did not have olive oil so I had to use vegetable oil. I also did not have coarse salt  so I used table salt, and my asparagus was way too salty. I had one bunch of asparagus so maybe it was not the amount that the recipe actually called for. But all in all it was a tasty recipe.

This was an easy and delicious recipe.  After reading other reviews I used 1/4cup Olive oil and butter flavored pan spray to cut down on the oiliness.  It worked well.

I make this all the time and it is great! I used to hate asparagus because I had child hood memories of the slimy boiled stuff my mom always served. My picky 13 year old even asks me to make this. I also throw garlic in at the end or else it will burn. I sprinkle pan roasted slivered almonds for texture and grate a little fresh parm on top before seving. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Tastes great and so easy!!! Have made this many times. I add the garlic during the last couple of minutes to prevent it from overcooking. Great recipe!

Was OK. It was way too greasy for us and we are a butter kind of family. Will stick to steaming our asaparagus and topping with lemon juice and butter from now on.

QUICK, EASY, AND DELICIOUS!  Did I say delicious?  I didn't have garlic on hand so I put the asparagus in the pan and sprinkled liberally with garlic powder!  It tasted great and full of flavor.  The best part is that you have a side dish in less than 10 minutes.  I didn't cook for 10 minutes because I like mine with a lil crunch so I just watched/ turned them until they were the texture I wanted and took them out.  My 13 y.o. raved and said he couldn't stop eating them and my neighbor who was over for dinner commented how good the asp was.  Definitely a keeper!!

Next time, I would cut the butter way down, at least in half on this and still would have a great-tasting dish.  Only cooked for about 3-4 minutes until it was bright green, warmed through, but still crunchy; 10 minutes would have overcooked it.  This was really delicious and I think is my new fave way to prepare asparagus.  DH & I LOVED it!  Thank you, Kim!

I love asparagus and usually grill or steam it.  I loved this recipe although it was a lot of butter.  Next time I will use less butter.  Great and easy recipe!

Very, very good.  Easy, too.  I also tried it adding a little more garlic and used fresh string beans instead  of asparagus.  Also good.

This is another great way to cook asparagus if you're looking for something to do besides steaming it.  I reduced the cooking time to about 5 minutes, since I like it crisp and I reduced the amount of butter a bit.

Very yummy!  I thought it was a little too buttery though since I'm used to steamed veggies.  I'll probaby cut the amount of butter in half next time and I think it would still be just as tasty.  Also, I added just a  dash of lemon juice to mine which turned out well.

YUMMY!!!  My mom-im-law came over for dinner & I made this recipe along with the Cheesy Pesto Chicken Wraps(also found on this site)!!  Dinner looked like something you would get at an expensive rest.  There was a bit to much butter, & I even added 1 lb. of asparagus, I will reduce next time.  But this is a definite keeper recipe!  U will luv it!!

This was very tasty, although like others, I thought a little too greasy, even after cutting the fat in 1/2. I will make again, though, just with some adjustments.

Who knew asparagus could taste so good??  I 86'ed the butter and just used olive oil.  Also, I didn't add the garlic til the asparagus was cooking.  Yummy, thanks!  :o)

This is an excellent recipe.  I modify the cooking process slightly as I was having a dinner party and preparing more asparagus then the recipe called for. I increased the other ingredients.  I blanched the asparagus in small portions (dropped in boiling water for about 2-3 minutes then into ice water) first, then set aside, then later continued the pan frying process for about 2-3 minutes.  Al Dente.  Asparagus kept its nice green color. Thanks for sharing.  Lots of compliments from my guests.

For such a simple recipe, it is incredibly tasty!  I had a ton of asparagus so have made it the past two nights.  I did cut down on the amount of butter the second time - it was still wonderful.  Great recipe.

I always prepare asparagus like this and so I was pleasantly surprised to find this similar recipe.  I make it without the butter, however, and don't really find that I miss it.  I also add sliced mushrooms and find that it goes nicely with the asparagus :)

This was very good, but hubby prefers my old way, let the butter just brown with the seasonings then add 2 tablespoons of white wine to stop the browning so it doesn't burn.  When butter just begins to brown it takes on a nutty aroma and taste.  I also add almonds or pine nuts.

This recipe is fantastic. I did add shredded parmesan to asparagus right off of the stove (so it melts a little). I would however, definitely cut back on the butter. It seems like an unnecessary amount.

This recipe is so delicious and easy that I made it twice in one week!  And, my daughter, who never would try asparagus, at it too!!!   It is hard to keep the garlic from burning, so the second time I made it, I sliced the garlic thicker and as they started to brown it was easy to scoop them out of the pan.  THIS IS A KEEPER!  Thanks for sharing!

Very good recipe...except the spears turned out a bit too salty.  I will definitely make this again, but next time I would suggest reducing the butter and salt content.  : ) Thanks!

I have never liked asparagus before this recipe. I went to make it for my boyfriend b/c he likes it. I tasted a little and liked it alot. It had much more flaver with the garlic.  Didn't have olive oil and just used veggie oil turned out fine.  mmmm  I would make again!

Very delicious. The flavor was excellent and it was the first time I actually enjoyed eating asparagus. I would recommend blotting off a little bit of the grease, though, because it was so saturated with grease by the time it was done cooking that I felt a little bad eating it... the flavor was great, but it just felt like I had turned something healthy into something unhealthy.

This was pretty good.  I think I will use less olive oil and butter.  It seemed kinda greasy to me.  I might have not used enought asparagus though.  I will make it again.  My kids liked it.

Very good.  I used 1/4 cup of butter and 2 tablespoons of oil but cooked over a pound of asparagus and it was still too much butter and oil.  My mom had never eaten asparagus before, so I added extra garlic so that the asparagus wouldn't taste so strong.  She loves garlic so naturally, she liked it.

Wow. Buttery, delicious, perfect.  I've almost won over 2 of my 3 kids!  My garlic browned immediately, so I must've had the heat too high.  To serve, I lifted the asparagus out of the pan leaving the liquid, garlic & salt in the pan.  That kept it from being too strong tasting or too oily.

when i scaled the recipe to 8, it seemd to be a bit odd.  there was no way 1lb of asparagus would make 8 servings, so i recommend 3lbs, a full cup of butter, 1/2 cup of olive oil, 3.5tsp of salt, and 4tsp of minced garlic.  we may have clogged some arteries, but these were sensational!!

This is DELICIOUS. We are big asparagus fans and this recipe is the best. We like our asparagus quite crisp so I decreased the cooking time to 7 minutes. I also used about half the oil and butter. YUM!

A wonderful side dish! The only hint I would add is that if your aspargus is large, may take a little longer to cook. If your aspargus spears are thin, be careful toward the end of cooking or they will burn!

Simple and delicious. We used thick-stalked asparagus which, naturally, took longer to cook. Use the recommended cooking time of 10 min. as a general guideline only, and vary it accordingly. I also recommend using a medium-low heat setting, to prevent the garlic from burning before the asparagus is finished cooking.

This was excellent!  I'm glad I took the advice of some of the others who rated this recipe and lowered the oil and butter amounts.  I only used half and it was more than enough.  Will definitely make again, but use more garlic.  Thanks!

I like asparagus but I will not make this again.  I doubled the amount of asparagus and it was still swimming in oil.

I love asparagus already, and with this recipe, I love it even more!  This was easy to make, the recipe is great!  Unfortunately, if you're watching your weight, this isn't something you can have all the time...I'm going to try cutting back on the butter next time.  Hopefully it'll turn out just as well!  :)

Very fatty and salty.  Basic good flavor but I definitely won't make it again.

A Wonderful recipe.  We did, however, find them a bit salty, and will cut down on the salt to half the amount next time.

This is great. Although the asparagus doesn't look very appetizing (slightly on the brownish side), they are delicious! My asparagus hating children even liked them.

I made this recipe for our weekly Sunday night gathering for dinner at my Mother-in-law's house and it was a huge hit. Served with Bella's Rosemary Potatoes (also found on his site), which are already a family favorite, our meal was excellent! It will be hard to top next Sunday!

This was quite good.  After reading the reviews, I decided to make a few changes. After making the recipe, I would make even more changes. I think this is closer to what should be done: On med-high, melt 3 Tbsp Unsalted Butter + 1/2 tsp salt & 1/4 tsp pepper. Add asparagus & 2 Tbsp Olive Oil. Cook 5 min. Add garlic (3 tsp minced garlic), cook for another 2-3 minutes. Voila!

I agree with others who suggested less butter, and cut mine back some (but not enough). I also seasoned the cooking asparagus lightly with lemon pepper, which wasn't necessary but fit with the rest of the meal.  Very, very good!!

4.8 Stars:  I used an olive oil, butter mix and the pan got a little dry so I added a bit of chicken broth, which  boiled it.  I covered it per either this or another recipe, so between the broth and covering, it was a little more done than I wanted.  BUT, the recipe is great and I will cook asparagus like this more often.

I usually add a little soy sauce instead of salt but my husband and I loved this recipe.  The asparagus is accented not masked by the soy.  My son still likes the soy sauce version but he's a kid!

I love this recipe.  I added a few changes.  melt about 2 tsp of butter add asparagus. I add about 1 tsp of sea salt and 1 tsp of fresh ground pepper corns. Turn asparagus about 4 mins. each side. And add garlic at the end instead of at the beginning. Leave out the olive oil.

Great flavor! I think I prefer broiled or grilled asparagus, but those weren't an option for me this time as my oven was occupied and the grill looks like a snow drift... I added some lemon pepper and a little red wine vinegar at the end too. :)

I loved it. I just couldn't stop testing it in the pan well it was still cooking. I made exactly as stated except I used thawed frozen asparagus because it was what I had on hand. The temp seemed a bit high but in the end it caramelized on the asparagus wonderfully. I did use chopped garlic in the jar as it was what I had on hand. I cooked it for ten minutes then took the pan of the heat but let it sit well I finished the rest of dinner, say five minutes and it was amazing. My hunny told me to make it again tonight. I use to think asparagus with parm cheese roasted in the oven was my favorite but I was so wrong

Tried it for the first time last night and found it easy and delicious.  The only thing I added was a bit of grated parmesan cheese the last minute of cooking the asparagus.  This is a simple and elegant way of preparing asparagus.

Although I feel it is hard to ruin any asparagus dish, there is Way TOO much butter!!  I also added some fresh squeezed lemon to it and served it with Tilapia.  Yummy but cut butter in 1/2 for sure!!

My family really liked the taste but I agree with the rest of the reviews. The asparagus ended up being super slick due to the amount of butter and olive oil. I also questioned how healthy it was due to the amount of these ingredients but it was an undeniably tasty way to eat asparagus!

Very Good! I will definitely make again. I took some advice from the other reviews and lowered the amount of butter. I also waited till the end to put in the garlic. I used minced garlic which added a bit of crunchiness that was superb. I threw on a bit of lemon juice at the end as well.

I grew up with a father that kept his eye pealed for asparagus along the highway and railways - when it was ready to be picked---and was gone - he got a bit irate!! So when he was able to get some he didn't care if he shared it or not. In other words - asparagus was the only vegetable  that went on our table that I wasn't made to eat. Therefore I never became a fan of asparagus nor made it as an adult---until now. A nice neighbor dropped some off to us from farmers market. I really liked this recipe. I made it as was stated - but I did use some of the marinate from the chicken (Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kabobs)on top. Both were yummy!!

Great, simple recipe.  I added some garlic from a jar later in the cooking but only because I was too lazy to mince the fresh.

Really great flavor contrasts: salty, pungent and garlicky on the outside, bittersweet  asparagus flavor on the inside.  I like this recipe, but I made some changes.  I blanched the asparagus in a pot of boiling water for 1 minute, then cooled it.  Sauteed the garlic, salt and pepper in 1 T of olive oil; when the garlic was tender, I tossed the asparagus in, stirred to coat with the garlic oil, and done.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good.  I tend to like steamed better, but the pan-fried was very similar and the garlic flavor was a nice change.

This is a very simple and yummy way to make asparagus.  However I do agree with other reviews and suggest not to use as much butter and oil.  When this was served I was very dissappointed in the dripping because the asparagus was soaked in butter and oil.  The taste is wonderful and just needs less "fat" required to cook.

Great recipe but the amount of olive oil and butter is WAY too much. I followed Naples34102 advice.  I drizzled olive oil in a pan and stir fried the asparagus. I added a little bit of butter and added the salt, pepper, and garlic at the end after lowing the temp.

Wow this was great, will make all my asparagus this way from now on.  The only thing was I put a lid on the pan and cooked it quite a while longer because we like our asparagus a little more tender.  Thanks!

I have been using a similar recipe for many years, but do not use any butter.  Just olive oil! All other ingredients are the same.  Love It!  Better than any restaurant asparagus.

The BEST asparagus yet!  I think the garlic made the difference.  A little too much butter & olive oil though. I served it with the Foolproof Rib Roast from this site.

I never change a thing whenever I make this asparagus - perfect as is. However, I can understand why some people would think it's too buttery. I've never been a vegetable lover, so I need my greens soaked in SOMETHING so it's palatable. An 1/8 cup of butter would still work well. Happy cooking!

My parents said this was the best asparagus they've ever had. Even my hubby liked it and he is not an asparagus fan. I did use jar garlic and add it near the end of cooking. Great recipe!

Great seasonings, but next time I won't cook for a full 10 minutes... I like my asparagus to have a little crunch to it and this was just a little too soft.

Unbelievably good!! I'm not sure I'll ever eat steamed asparagus again! I followed the recipe exactly, except I added the garlic a little more than 1/2 way thru. Perfect!! I'll definately be making this again & again!! Thank you!

I followed the advice of others.  I cooked my asparagus in the butter/oil and when it was almost done, added the fresh garlic and lots of it. I used 2.25 lbs of asparagus.  Delish!

My children and I loved this dish. I followed directions to the t and did not have a problem with any of it. I kept my temps low so I wouldn't burn the garlic and it was fabulous!

Simple and yummy but I also had to change recipe.  Decrease the butter for the amount of asparagus and add garlic last so you do not burn it.  Garlic tastes bitter if you cook first.

It was good, not headline making but pretty tasty. Next time I'd like to try something a little different with asparagus, but fried in garlic was nice.

I steamed my asparagus 1st until tender crisp then finished it in the sauce.  I toasted some sliced almonds in the butter which adds sooo much flavor.  I usually like fresh garlic but I love the jarred, chopped stuff for this recipe.  It's a little sweeter/nuttier. This was the best asparagus I've had!  I do the exact same thing with green beans and love that even more. Thanks for the recipe!

Disappointing..  I used a bit of olive oil, and cut back on the butter, as suggested by most reviews.  It was bland.  Sorry!

Very good!  I made these to eat along side our Bacon Roasted Chicken.  When it was time to remove the bacon from the chicken, I chopped it up and added it to the fry pan with the asparagus.  It was a great addition and husband couldn't get enough!

I made this asparagus for a dinner party we had last night and it was really delicious.  I covered the asparagus to help it along, but having a lot of stuff on the go at once caused me to slightly overcook it.  In saying that, it was still very, very good and I will make it again for sure.  The only point worth mentioning is that the amount of butter/oil called for is not necessary; you can easily reduce the amounts by half.

Loved this recipe. I don't even like asparagus, but my husband does. Decided I'd try it from all the great reviews. I halved the oil, but kept everything else the same. I cooked until the asparagus was crispy on both sides. Tasty, easy and quick. My kind of recipe.

I used much less butter than was recommended in the recipe, and it all came out quite amazin'! Next time I'll probably just use 1 tp of butter(I used maybe 1 tb this time)--I wouldn't omit it as it adds flavor to the asparagus. I'll definitely be trying this with green beans next.

Even though it's not the healthiest application for asparagus, it tastes so good I had to give it 5 stars!  Definitely use at least 1 lb of asparagus for the listed amount of butter and oil.  I probably used about 1.5 pounds and I thought it turned out deliciously.

I've made this twice and absolutely love it the first I followed exactly and was a little to much butter, but still very good, next time I cut the butter in half and it was perfect. I've used asparagus and broccoli so far and will with squash. Thanks for this great recipe.

This is a great way to make asparagus.  I used Smart Balance Light butter to make it a little healthier and it was still great.  It had such a nice flavor.

This is one of the best asparagus recipes that I have tried.  I did double the amount of asparagus as others had suggested.  It would have been far to oily if left as stated in the recipe.  I will make this again.

Good, but the butter was too heavy (but I was in the mood for something light, so that's my fault). Also, I think it's important to put the garlic in towards the end.

LOVE this recipe, but I did make one modification. I just don't like the idea of that much butter, so I substituted a little more olive oil instead. Also, this kept me from burning the asparagus (which happened the first time when I made it with the butter). The flavor is still amazing using only oil and no butter. WONDERFUL recipe; thanks for it!!!

Like some other reviewers, I have been making this for years. You really can't go wrong. This works with many other veggies as well. I do add lots more garlic since we love it, and you can even use garlic salt instead of regular salt. I also don't use butter. The garlic is so yummy when it carmelizes, and I cook it on high so that the asparagus stays crunchy yet is browned beautifully...that's where your flavor is. So good!

Fabulous! We omitted the butter from the recipe and upped the olive oil. Asparagus fixed this way is very tasty!

I've cooked asparagus like this for years, it is an EXCELLENT recipie! Just don't cook them too long or they become soggy - 10 minutes max.  Instead of all that butter and fat, use about 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and you'll get the same results.

This is a standard recipe...I've used it for many years-Oil, litlle butter, garlic, salt & pepper..and any vegetable-my favorite is spinach. Make sure you par-boil and harder veggies you use (carrots, potatoes, etc.) Green beans also work well with this cooking method.

Great recipe that we make often.  I've also added parmesan and/or a little balsamic vinegar to change it up once in awhile.  Even my 5-year old eats this!

Great recipe. Just make sure you cut back on the oil and butter. I used half of what was called for for 3.5 pounds of asparagus. I do not like my veggies swimming in oil. I did prepare it a little different. I steamed the asparagus. I sauteed the garlic in the butter, oil and pepper as called for. I skipped the salt. I poured the butter mixture over the asparagus. I actually prepare this a day ahead and then just reheat. Very yummy. Thanks Kim for the simple ingredients that make for a great recipe. This recipe is enjoyed by asparagus lovers.

My mom does not like garlic so instead of mincing it, I just threw a clove in to decrease the intensity.  I also eyeballed about a tsp. of olive oil, 2 tsp. of butter, a pinch of salt and pepper for a 1/2 lb. of asparagus.  It was delicious and this was the first time I ate asparagus.

I prefer this recipe without the butter because the olive oil and the butter together make the asparagus too greasy.

overall this was good but I DEFINITELY will wait until the end to add the garlic! It was really burnt by the time the asparagus was done. I would shorten the cooking time also.

My daughter and I love asparagus and this recipe is the best! I only use 1 Tsp. butter and just a couple of Tsp. of olive oil. Like some of the other reviewers, I don't add the garlic until the last couple of minutes. It tastes wonderful and fresh, a true "taste of spring"!

I am not a big fan of asparagus and this was my first experience cooking it.  The recipe looked simple enough.  Although my boyfriend loved it, I'm not quite convinced yet.  Maybe my taste buds aren't mature enough for this vegetable just yet.  I'll make it again for him only if he asks for it.

Cut the salt DRASTICALLY!  I like salt, but half the called-for amount is still twice as much as you'll need or want.  Also, I cut the oil in half and it was still pretty oily.

This seemed a little bland to us even though we also added parmesan cheese towards the end. Plus, asparagus is so expensive this is not something you could make everyday.

Never made asparagus before, but my kids really liked it.  I agree it was too much butter and the cook time was a little long, top started to wilt.  But overall very tasty way to eat asparagus, will make again, though with less butter.

I cooked the asparagus too long, so it was a little mushy, but the flavour was excellent!  Definately something to make again.

We tried this recipe for Easter dinner. I'm so glad we did!! Everyone loved it, including my two year old, who ate all the leftovers. I will cut the butter in half next time, but other than that it was wonderful! I will make this everytime asparagus goes on sale!1

The only Asparagus I have liked until now is at Antoine's in New Orleans (yummy!). This is very good. I did take into account previous reviewers suggestions and use half the butter, used minced garlic from the jar. Thanks for the recipe and the previous reviewers suggestions!

Great flavor but it seemed like way too much butter/oil for 1/2# asparagus.  I didn't have coarse salt, so used 1/4 t of regular.  Will definitely use this recipe again, only increase asparagus to atleast 1#.  Think this would be great way to prepare broccoli too.  Thanks for sharing this very tasty recipe, Kim.

This is excellent.  I have made this multiple times and have always just used half the butter but the last time I omitted all of the butter, and it still was excellent.

No better way to enjoy the first asparagas of the spring than pan frying it! I usually add a little soy sauce.

Quick, tasty and great to add to any meal!  Wonderful way to spice up asparagus and we enjoyed it quite a bit.  I also added 1/3 part of white wine and 1/4 part extra virgin olive oil to add a richer flavor.  Went well with the garlic.  Also a nice side because it can sit and simmer, very low maintenance when approaching the end of cooking a meal....very good!

WOW - Thank you for this awesome recipe!  Used half the butter and oil, lots of fresh garlic(much better than the stuff from the jar)and we were fighting over them.

I loved the flavor, but would definitely use less butter next time.  I'll probably only use a couple of tablespoons the next time I make it, which will be soon!

This recipe is a great way to make veggies taste good!  I have made it twice.  The first time I used large asparagus and had to cook it much longer.  The second time I used thinner asparagus and zucchini spears.  Turned out great.  Will make this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing!

Yummy!  I could've eaten this for my whole meal! I used coarse Hawaiian Sea Salt and a bit more garlic. You don't have to saute the garlic first. Also, on my stove med-high for 10 minutes was too long.  Try 5-6 minutes for thin asparagus; I like mine a little crunchy. Thicker asparagus probably takes longer though.

WOW. Won't be able to have asparagus any other way! The seasonings are simple but just the right additions to enhance the flavor and disguise the sometimes-grassy taste of fresh asparagus. Our two- and four-year-olds even enjoyed their veggies tonight! Next time we may cut down on the butter and increase the olive oil to make it a little better for the heart. We served with Pinot Noir. Excellent choice.

This is my favorite way to make asparagus!  My picky brother and nephew despised asparagus before this recipe...my brother said it was ok, but ate all that was on his plate, my nephew ate what was on HIS plate, then ate what was leftover...I think he has a new respect for asparagus!

Excellent! I only used 2 tbs butter and 2 tbs olive oil, which was plenty. I also sprinkled some lemon pepper in it. My kids aren't thrilled with asparagus, but then neither was I when I was little. My husband and I loved this!

I would have given this 5 stars if it wasn't for the amount of butter called for in the recipe.  Thankfully I read the reviews before I prepared it.  I used about 3 T. of butter and more garlic than was called for.  I cooked and stirred it for a couple of minutes and then I covered it for about 4-5 minutes more.  It turned out perfectly crisp tender.  My brother really liked it.  He had 3 servings plus ate what was on his wife's place.

I added a splash of white cooking wine (which I found in another Allrecipes version submitted).  This is wonderful.  I made sure my asparagus was still bright green and a bit "snappy."  This is a keeper!

It's amazing how much tastier the asparagus is when it's pan-fried with garlic butter, versus steamed with butter added afterwards.  I doubled the amount of asparagus and it was perfect.  Wonderful asparagus!!

I am not a huge veggie fan however decided to try this recipe because I am always looking for good veggie recipes ... it was really good, I was pleasantly surprised.  I followed the recipe exactly but I did add some parmesan cheese (an idea I got from the Asparagus with Parmesan Crust recipe from this site).  Would definitely make this recipe again, it was very good.

My husband loved it more than me...I think I'll use just 1tbsp of olive oil...I found it a bit too oily, but the butter flavour was very good. Make sure not to put it in the fridge right away when it's still warm or they'll shrivel up a bit.

Much better flavor compared to simple steamed asparagus.  Make sure to measure out the oil though, as too much leaves it very oily and almost distracting from the veggie flavor.  Otherwise, garlic and pepper these bad boys up this is a tasty one!

"Delicious!" "Awesome!"  "This is the best asparagus I ever had!"   I cannot personally attest to how good this recipe is, as I would rather eat a stone than eat asparagus but I'm told by those I've made it for that it is very, very good.

GREAT FLAVOR.  I DOUBLED THE AMOUNT OF ASPARAGUS AND FEEL I STILL COULD HAVE USED LESS BUTTER.

Recipe was simple and quite good.  I think with a little effort it could become very good or outstanding.  I think it needs a little crunch maybe like some type of nut and I think I will try it with a little sprinkle of Parmesan on top just before serving.

The recipe is very good, but we had to cook it for much longer in a wok pan. We made it again today, but we steamed the aspargus first and then did the wok. Much faster!

This is a very good, very simple recipe.  Next time, I'll use less butter, probably half as much, because there was a lot left in the pan.  (I poured the leftover on top of potatoes, and it was great.)  I didn't have coarse salt, so I just substituted regular table salt, about a half-teaspoon.  I didn't have any trouble cooking the butter and garlic, but I'd recommend medium heat, rather than medium-high, especially if you're doing other things and can't watch it very closely. I wish I'd made a pound of asparagus, rather than half, though, because we wanted more.

Made this last night on the spur of the moment. Dh said he wasn't hungry but I didn't want the asparagus to go bad. I asked him to taste it and he sat down and ate the whole thing! He said the recipe was a keeper. 

I did cut back on the butter a little and I cooked for just under the 10min.

This was very good.  My husband and I don't usually eat much asparagus, but he asked for seconds!  Delicious!  I made it exactly like the recipe said.  It was a great side to the lobster I cooked for Valentine's Day!

Very good! I usually don't like asparagus either, but this was great. I reduced the butter by half, and I'm sure I had more than the 1/2 pound of asparagus in there-- more like 1 1/2 pounds, and there was still oil in the pan when I removed the asparagus to serve. Note: I wouldn't recommend white asparagus with this-- too fibrous to make the pan-frying work for fully cooking it.

This was very good, but next time I will only use about 1T each of butter and olive oil, as the current amount made it WAY too greasy.

OUTSTANDING!!  This has to be the best asparagus that I have had.  I made them for Easter and the 3lbs were gone.  I personnally dont like them real hard so cooked them longer than the 10 min. suggestion.  This one is a keeper.  
Thanks for sharing.

This was wonderful. I made it for Easter dinner but didn't use all the garlic the recipe called for. I did make it as originally submitted but my husband said the garlic drowned out the taste of the asparagus. I toned it down and it was great. Thank you!

Very good, but too salty. I would cut the amount of salt in half.

I make this alot - it is wonderful!!!  I only use half of all ingredients except asparagus and it turns out great.  It is best when you use the smallest asparagus you can find.

So easy & brought out such a wonderful flavor in the asparagus.  I halved both the butter & the oil & it turned out great.  The 10 minute cook time was perfect.

I agree with the ratings.  I did not use as much butter (and even oil).  It was absolutely awesome!  I won't ever cook asparagus a different way again.

It was a *tiny* bit salty for my taste, but everyone else just loved it!  If I were going to make it again, I would tone down the salt a bit.  Also, I  didn't fry the asparagus for a full ten minutes... it seemed done after about 8 minutes, so watch it carefully!  This dish is highly seasoned, but a great flavor.  Will make again!

Although it came out too salty for my taste, my husband loved it. I think next time I will omit half of the salt. Great garlic flavor in this.

AWESOME!  My husband and I loved this.  I made it for a fancy birthday dinner and he went nuts over it.  He said it was the highlight of the meal (it was a really fancy meal too) and he begs me to make it all the time!  You have to try it, it's so easy.

This was awesome and easy.  I only added half the salt and that seemed to be plenty.  The garlic fried up so nicely my husband wants me to make it with more next time.

Excellent flavor and easy and quick to prepare. The next time I make this recipe I will use 1/2 teaspoon of salt as compared to a full teaspoon. I used four cloves of garlic and feel this only enhanced an already great side dish.

This was an AMAZING dish!  We took advantage of the season and served it at Easter brunch.  The taste was awesome, and the texture was refreshing-crisp, and not soggy at all.  And the garlic and a wonderful complimenting flavor.  I have made this again several times, and will continue.  This has become a family favorite!

garlic too overpowering for the delicate (and expensive) taste of fresh asparagus.  Might work though with some fresh green beans.

Huge hit with me and my husband; we love garlic.  Nice to find a new way to cook asparagus. I cut back a bit on the butter and oil and it was still very flavorful.

Nice recipe, but watch out for the garlic.  I do love garlic, but it REALLY gets into the tips.  If you are having an otherwise spicy meal, you might want to cut down on the cloves.

I have never been a fan of asparagus but have been trying to "broaden my horizons" a little and try some different recipes.  This side dish was wonderful and so easy to make.  We all loved it.  Will definitely make again!

great-tasting, the garlic flavor is very intense (especially at the tips, if they brown/blacken).  Cook longer if you have thicker asparagus.

This was my first time making asparagus.  It literally took like 2 minutes to throw all the ingredients together and then cooked for 10 minutes.  My friends loved it, I couldn't believe how simple it was.

Very nice change in the preparation of fresh asparagus.  I reduced the butter and oil, but it is still delicious, either way.

My husband and I just loved this recipe. The kids on the other hand were less than enthusiastic. I will probably steam the asparagus a little before frying it as it took forever to soften up the stalks. Yummy

This was so tasty. I used very skinny asparagus and it worked great. I think the thick stalks would be too tough.

I have made this 3 times in the past 2 weeks.  I cut the butter to 2 tbsp and the last time added half of a sweet red pepper, sliced thin, with the asparagus.  My husband is really picky about vegetables and loves this, too!  Great recipe.

This recipe called for a surprising amount of oil. The cooking time is to long, it gave the asparagus a texture that was slightly to mushy.

We thought this was pretty good. The flavor was very intense. I had a hard time keeping the garlic from browning/burning, which intensified the flavor even more. It was still good though.

Wonderful!  I made this recipe for my husband and teen-age son.  They thought it was particularly flavorful and said it was definitely a keeper.  Very simple.  I did use half the butter/oil called for in the recipe with no consequence.

Cook whole green beans in similar way (with less oil and butter).  Beans change color as they're stir-fried.  Then add 4 tablespoons chicken broth, cover, and let steam for about 6 minutes for delicious green beans.  Very tasty, fast, & nutritious!

I made this for our Easter dinner today.  It was so easy and delicious.  I omited the olive oil and just used the butter and only about 4 tablespoons.  I used about 3 pounds of cut up asparagus.  It all was gone and received many compliments.  Thanks for sharing!!

I tested this recipe to make for  Easter dinner this year and  I loved it!!!  I'm sure 
my guests will love it too.  I added zucchini and yellow squash and it was wonderful!
My husband and I loved it and my picky kids even tried it.  I can't wait to serve
this dish on Easter Sunday!!!

WOW, in all my years of making asparagus I never thought to make them this way.  This was really great.  In the past, I would just boil or steam asparagus.  In looking at the reviews, I took one suggestion and cut down the butter and olive oil by half, and it was still excellent - 5 STARS!

This is a great way to fix asparagus, that's a little different.  The second time I made it, I used half the oil, butter, and salt, and it was still plenty.  Once you get the proportions the way you like them, it's delicious!

My kids were never big on asparagus, but always love dishes with lots of garlic.  This recipe had my 6-year old son asking for seconds.  Very good and very easy.  Will be making this again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it went over well with everyone who liked asparagus.  Nobody else would try it because of the bad reputation asparagus has, but those of us who ate it liked it really well.

Great recipe, I love garlic and it simply enhanced the flavor of the asparagus.
My husband doesn't like asparagus, but tasted this recipe and actually liked it!
Thank you Kim, now I can buy asparagus and know that it'll get eaten!

This dish was delicious and a hit with the company we had our first time making it.  We cut down on butter and salt as suggested and increased the oil.  My suggestion is to steam asparagus in the microwave for about five minutes first to soften it up.  Thanks!

Delicious!  I increased the olive oil to three tablespoons, cut the butter by half and cooked an entire 'bunch' of asparagus.  Since I used lightly salted butter, I scrapped that too.  It's melt in your mouth scrumptious.  I think it's one of the best, simple recipes I've ever seen anywhere.

We were at a loss as to how to make asparagus outside of steaming - this is wonderful.  We reduced the salt to our tastes, but otherwise, perfect!

loved it!  I didn't mind the amounts of butter and olive oil.  it was perfect for the bunch of asparagus I bought.  I did also add a dash of italian seasoning and a dash of lemon pepper (with less black pepper to start with).  That was really good!

Delicous! Here's a tip: make sure you put the asparagus in butter, not oil. I know the recipe says butter, but some people might put oil as a substitute, and that makes these very unflavorful. But, if you follow the recipe, these will taste amazing! Thanks for the recipe:)

After reading several reviews, I made a few changes. I used about half of the asparagus. First, I sauteed a handful of baby bella mushrooms in a little olive oil and butter for 2 min. Then I added the asparagus (~2" pieces). Sauteed that for about 8 min, for tender-crisp. About 1 minute before it was done, I added two cloves of minced garlic. Nothing worse than burnt garlic, and this would prevent it. Great topped with parmesan cheese, but I also tried with store-bought crisp fried onions.

I added the garlic in the last few minutes of cooking so it wouldn't burn. Will definitely make it again.

It's great, but don't give in to the olive oil mafia...you can't tell the difference without the olive oil. All the TV cooks try to get you to smother everything in olive oil. Even sometimes in deserts. Fight the olive oil mafia, only use it when you need to!

Great recipe except  the garlic got burned. Next time will add garlic towards the end where it only cooks for a few minutes. Better flavor than steaming the asparagus..

You can't go wrong with this recipe.  First I used my fork to eat them, then I was eating them like French fries (I would prefer these over fries any day, don't even need ketchup!).  I cooked them for about 8 1/2 - 9 minutes.

Super easy and pretty dang delish. A lot of people seemed to be all turned off with the amount of butter listed, but the fact is you don’t have to eat it all. It did help that I had more than a pound in the pan - they were pretty long so I cut them in half and then there seemed to be so much! But I had a lot of butter to move it around in, and in the end a bunch of butter in the pan (I removed to another bowl after cooking ). I didn’t find it too salty and the garlic didn’t burn either - it was quite delicious! I did consider topping off with some red wine, but decided to go with the recipe as written the first time. So glad I did - yum! Will try tweaks some other time. As is, it was a fabulous side to birthday steaks!

This is by far the best asparagus I've ever had.  I added mushrooms just because I love them. I'd share a picture but it didn't last long enough on our plates.  I did however shared this recipe on Facebook for everyone to try.
 Yum yum!

I made this with much less butter and oil and I also added the garlic closer to the end of cooking to prevent it burning. Turned out perfect and delicious. Can't wait to make again.

I have been making this for years.  I don't use olive oil, less butter and use more garlic but we love garlic.  I don't add the garlic until the asparagus is almost cooked because it will get over cooked.  Also, I use low to med low heat.  Once the aspargus is cooked tender crisp, take it off the heat, plate and serve immediately or put in a dish and serve immediately.  The hot pan will continue to cook the asparagus and it will get overcooked, Yuk.

This was really tasty. I did omit the olive oil, next time I will probably use half the butter. I used garlic salt instead of regular salt or garlic. Also at the end I sprinkled a bit of Parmesan cheese on it. My husband loved it!

Since I was making this for only two of us, I'm not sure now much asparagus I used but I eye-balled the other ingredients and directions.  The asparagus turned out very delicious and hubby enjoyed it as well as I.  Definitely a good way to cook this veggie and I will definitely make it this way again.

I don't like asparagus, but my husband does. He wanted to have it so I sought out a recipe that maybe I could like too. I was surprised by this because I liked it. I melted 2 tablespoons of butter with a splash of olive oil in a cast iron pan. Then I added the asparagus with sea salt and black pepper. Near the end of the cook time, I added three, minced, fresh garlic cloves. Great flavor and less green vegetable tasting. I served this alongside Red Wine Flavored Beef (on this site), so the red wine sauce combined with the asparagus. I'll make this recipe again.

This is how I've been preparing asparagus for years although I've never measured anything.  It's the preferred method for my husband and me. I like to add a few splashes of teriyaki or soy sauce and occasionally orange or lemon zest. The beauty of pan-fried is that you can play around with whatever seasonings you'd like to try. Thanks, Kim, for sharing your recipe!

Was not sure how many stars to give this because: there is no way you can cook this at said temp without the garlic burning and becoming quite bitter! I took this off burner, poured into microwave safe casserole the moment garlic started getting too brown, and finished off in microwave for 5 minutes at 50% power. It was delicious then.

Yummy!  Will definitely be making this again and again.  Had some cauliflower I wanted to use up, so sliced and cooked it with the asparagus. The second time I made the asparagus I sliced it into bite size pieces before  frying.  Probably not as nice a presentation, but much easier to eat.

My kids even love asparagus now! Buy young slender asparagus stalks. I trim off a fair amount to make sure it is tender. I have pan fried it, I have grilled it, I have backed it, all with this basic recipe. It's delicious no matter how you cook it.

Actually very tasty.  I liked it very much. Useful information on  preparing asparagus as well. Thanks for the tip. I recommend this recipe if you want something different for your asparagus. PS I wouldn't fried too long as recommended. I would fried it about 5 minutes as oppose to 10 minutes. We all enjoyed it!

It's a fairly basic recipe that has decent flavor, however:

It's nearly impossible to saute garlic over medium-high heat for over 10 minutes without it browning (and burning). The garlic should be added very close to the end, maybe with only a couple minutes left on the asparagus.

It's an awful lot of butter and olive oil for my taste, but I just used less than in the recipe and it tasted great.

Just know that you need to add the garlic toward the end of the 10 minutes, not before you even add the asparagus.

This was very good.  I took some other reviewers recommendations and cut down on the butter and added most of the garlic at the end.  I did cook a little garlic before added the asparagus so that the oil has some garlic flavor.    This was VERY easy, especially since I used jarred minced garlic..

I wish I had read the reviews and added the garlic at the end.  How do you not burn garlic when cooking it for 10 minutes?  Other than the burnt garlic, it was pretty good. I will be making this again only I will add the garlic at the end.  I think they need to change this step in the directions.

So good! Whenever asparagus is on sale we buy 3 or 4 bunches and make this recipe 3 or 4 days in a row. My husband and I finish off the whole batch ourselves.

I used garlic powder instead of cloves and added a light sprinkle of Cavender's Greek seasonings.  We loved it! !  Plan on growing my own asparagus. The tip about bending until it breaks was great,  I didn't know about this trick!

I made it twice and loved it!  However I think 10 minutes is to long because it turned out mushy!  I like a little crisp!

This was quite delicious! Didn't find it as garlicky as I would've liked but the flavor of the butter really shines through and I found that 10 minutes in the pan was a perfect amount of time to get them not too soft and not too hard.

I followed the recipe just as it is. I find it lacking in flavor, and also quite "greasy". It's not exactly greasy, but there is simply too much butter used (never thought I'd say that!). There was a pool of oil left in my plate.  I used a teflon pan, if that makes a difference. Also be wary that if you have thinner pieces, they may burn a bit. Not a bad start, but not a completed recipe. Asparagus shouldn't feel heavy!

This was pretty tasty and worked great as a side dish for a pasta alfredo recipe. I might keep it on a lower heat or cook for less time the next time I make it, so the asparagus is less wilted and more crispy. But it's a very simple and delicious recipe!

This is the best Asparagus recipe!! Great with steak or chicken! Packed with flavor! However not the healthiest way to cook asparagus, so if your looking for a healthy recipe I wouldn't make it.

I added a bit more olive oil, NO salt. I grated parmesan instead. The garlic browned but I prefer browned garlic butter sauce. Awesome!

I made them already twice! Love it! I made my own garlic butter  (garlic, butter, parsley, solt and pepper)  and I used that to fried the asparagus. I add a little bit olive oil  also.  So, very easy and delicious!

A very tasty and easy recipe, I didn't change a thing! I have made other asparagus recipes, but this one is by far the best and my family loves it. It's even a favorite among some of the pickier eaters in my family. I may try adding in some other vegetables like carrots or brussels sprouts later on. I highly recommend giving this recipe a try.

We love this recipe and it's the only way we eat it now. We do add the garlic the last two or three minutes of cooking.

My son actually made this.  He is still inexperienced when it comes to cooking.  I guided him but he did a great job.  He rated it a 10!

Most N. Italian food is great in our family - we all loved it on Easter! It's ok to use half the amount of butter, or use the recipe and drain most back into the cooking pan as I allowed , while placing it onto the serving platter. It does keep the flavor and leave behind most of the oil / butter.

Agree with a lot of reviewers.  Way too much butter and oil.  I like my veggies crisp and this just came out way too soggy.  Flavor wasn't bad,just too much grease.

A real crowd pleaser!  I also cut the butter down by half and added the garlic towards the last few minutes.  I brought this to a potluck, and it microwaved up very well.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've been cooking asparagus this way for years, my only suggestion is just before the asparagus is done to add the juice of half a fresh lemon and the zest..it really brightens up the flavor!  The garlic burns easily so be careful. A guick and delicious way to prepare asparagus.

Awesome. It's like I'm eating asparagus from a nice restaurant. I used less butter but more EVOO. Next time I won't cook for quite so long. I like mine to have more of a crunch.

I loved this quick and tasty recipe.  I did cut the butter and olive oil back considerably.  I like things lighter not to cover the taste of the asparagus.  I will make this a regular rotation...Thanks

Great, easy recipe. I over cooked it, but I'm sure next time it will be swell. I used far less butter and no olive oil to reduce the fat content. My husband even ate it without complaining, which is rare in incidents involving asparagus.

This was a tasty way to prepare asparagus. I love asparagus and eat it often, usually either steaming it or roasting it in the oven. This was the first time I tried pan-frying it, and it came out wonderfully. Definitely do wait to add the garlic until near the end, and I think medium-high heat is a bit much. Mine was done in less than ten minutes with medium to medium-low heat.

As many other reviewers have stated, you have to be very careful with how much oil and butter you use.  It smells fantastic while it's cooking and taste wise, it's pretty good.

I'd never made fresh asparagus before I tried this recipe.  Even after halving the butter and oil it was slightly greasy, but otherwise great.  I drained the asparagus on some papertowels after I cooked them to remove some of the grease.  My 7 year old son absolutely loved this and ate all of his veggies before he touched anything else on his plate.  I'll make this again but try a little less butter next time.

This is a great change from the steamed version I always do.  The outside was a little crisp with a smooth inside. Remember not to cook too long.  Even when you take out of the pan they will still cook a little.  I will for sure make my asparagus this way more often.

Great recipe.  I followed others suggestions by cutting down the butter and salt and it turned out great.  If you don't asparagus that much you might want to give this a try.....it might just change your mind about asparagus :-)

I never liked asparagus but decided to try this anyway. First off I would like to say I will be making this again it was delish, but I found it to be way to salty so Ill have to cut down on that.   Thanks for the recipe, I can't wait to try it again.

I did this with the modifications specified by naples (i.e. putting the garlic in toward the end so it didn't burn). I loved it...I used the leftovers the next night in the goat cheese and asparagus quesadillas from this site. I'm not sure I'll ever do asparagus another way- this was great!

This was awesome. I usually use a little lemon on asparagus but the lime just made it so much better. I've now been using alot of lime in my cooking where I would normal use lemon, the lime just gives a better flavor all the way around.

My husband started eating out of the pan-I tried too.  The asparagus was almost gone before dinner was served.  My only change was adding parmesan cheese at the end.  YUM! YUM!

With adjustments mentioned by top two reviewers - to greatly reduce butter and oil - this turned out divine. This was very simple, easy to make and delicious. The kids loved, the adults loved it and I am now mixing in broccoli and green beans with asparagus as well.

I agree that the directions are a little off here. You absolutely have to start the asparagus first and add the garlic later, or you risk burnt garlic. The heat is too high and garlic burns quickly. Tasty recipe, but only if you prepare it differently than written.

A family favorite of mine who are from northern Italy as well.  In addition to this recipe, we drain the asparagus after frying it, and scramble in as many eggs as we need to feed the family.  It is awesome!!

Had our priest over for dinner and made these as he loves asparagus. I didn't follow the recipe measurements but I did the ingredients. I felt there was too much oil/butter so I used 2 TB O.O. and I didn't use any butter at all. I will be making this again- it was simple and wonderfully good!

My boyfriend wanted to rate this a 10, but unfortunately I had to give it the maximum of 5 stars.  I added my garlic at the end of the cooking time and also squeezed a few drops of lemon juice. Delicious.

I actually use this recipe with green beans!  Add some bacon to the garlic when it is cooking and throw in the green beans instead of asparagus!  It is WONDERFUL!

This was great.  I love Asparagus but my hubby does not so I never buy it, but he was not going to be home last night so I bought a bundle.  This is my first attempt at cooking asparagus and it was easy and tasted wonderful.  I had it with baked salmon, wonderful dinner I made for myself.

This was really tasty! I added less butter and olive oil, and added/sauteed the garlic just a few minutes before I took the pan off of the burner. My guests loved it!

Kids love it.  Depending on the thickness of the aspargus.  I sometimes cut in in half and cook the bottom sections a couple of minutes longer so they are as soft as the tops.

This was very good.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to lower the heat to medium because my garlic did get brown.  I lowered it when I saw it starting to turn color but it was too late.  It didn't affect the taste though, just wasn't as appealing to the eye.

I didn't really care for Asparagus until I tried preparing it this way.  Now I love it.  I think it is the butter that makes it so tasty.

This recipe has too much oil and butter. After I started the asparagus I read the reviews and saw the correction by the one who posted the recipe. I will try again with half of those ingreds.

I must say that I agree with the fact that there is far to much oil and butter for my tastes. Id rather taste the asparagus than all the oil. I too use less and add the garlic at the end. My husband likes it with a small amount of lemon zest and black pepper sprinkled over the top right before I serve it

made this for hubby's b-day dinner.  I had to use fresh green beans because asparagus is not in season and I couldn't find any.  We love this recipe.  Like others, I added mushrooms and I waited to the end to add the garlic.

I made this for Easter when I had approx. 14 people over for dinner.  Everyone loved it.  I sized up the recipe to accomodate all of the people, but I could still have used more.  So, if I were to have 14 people again, I would probably size up the recipe for 18.  The asparagus shrunk up quite a bit.

Very good! However, I agree with the above reviews, butter and oil should be cut down.

This was my first time cooking asparagus. I changed the proportions for 2 servings, and found it to be a little too buttery.  The garlic, however, added a really great flavor.

Very simple, very good. I'm starting to prepare many vegetables this way. Last night I pan fried string beans. I put the veggies into a colander to remove excess oil/butter before I plate them.

Good recipe - I made a few changes that make it 5 star in my book. I cut out the butter to save on the calories and just used olive oil. I then replaced the black pepper with white pepper for something a little different. The recipe as written is very good but the alterations I made still produced an amazing dish that was raved about - there were no left overs.

Very delicious and easy to make side dish. I served it alongside steak and mashed potatoes. The only change I would make next time is to decrease the amount of oil/butter. Will definetly make this again!

It was OK, but not great. I couldn't taste the garlic as much as I expected, and with both the butter and oil, it seemed a little too greasy. I prefer roasted asparagus. Thanks for the recipe idea, though.

very yummy... a tad salty though.  if you have any sort of heart condition, i would recommend seriously cutting down on the amount of salt.  in fact, i'd almost recommend that anyway from a "preventative" point of view.  i'd almost say that it would still retain its level of taste with nearly half the salt.  good otherwise!

This recipe is awesome.  Used the amount of garlic called for-we love garlic.  Be sure and bend the asparagus to find where it will "snap" to get rid of the tough part of the stalk.  Used 3 Tbsp of butter with the olive oil, and added a little fresh squeezed lemon.  Everyone loved it, even my year old son!  Thanks for sharing!

Very good and easy!  I used a pound of asparagus and only one tbsp of olive oil.  I also love garlic so I used 3 cloves.  This is a great way to eat asparagus and you can cook it to the firmness that you desire!

I absolutely loved these!  I have cooked asparagus many different ways and this is by far the yummiest and most tender version I have ever tried. This is my new favorite way to eat asparagus and my husband and I will never go back to boiling or steaming after trying this!

I didn't use the exact measurments as I forgot to print off the recipe, but remembered the ingredients and sort of added as needed while cooking these. Awesome flavor, I only used a maybe 2 tablespoons of butter and that was MORE than enough! So good!

Found a similar recipe which we really like.

Follow this recipe, but add a splash of Soy Sauce and a few drops of sesame seed oil. Delishih for an oriental flavor.

I used minced garlic in my fridge, like another user suggested, and that really cut down on cook time.  I also ran out of regular olive oil, and had some garlic infused olive oil on had, so I braised the asparagus with that as well.  It was so delicious!  I didn't use any salt, but sprinkled some of Penzey's Lemon Pepper blend at the last second, very light, to keep the flavor from being knock-out garlic, so I think that helped.  I served this with minestrone soup and fresh bread...perfect spring dinner!

I found this recipe a long time ago, but never gave it a try. WOW, I was missing out! It was my first time making fresh asparagus and it was great! I followed this recipe to a T. The only thing I will do different next time is cook the thicker pieces a little longer. This was a side dish for shrimp piccata. Will make again, VERY SOON!

My husband and I love this recipe.  Until last year, we had never eaten or cooked asparagus!!  We were served some with our entree at a well-known restaurant and were fans from then on.  But this recipe really adds flavor and I use garlic whenever I can. 

I do hate to alter recipes, but I did a little "tweeking" with yours Kim.  I used less olive oil and butter and I only added the garlic at the very end so it wouldn't get too brown and taste bitter.

What a  great recipe, a "keeper" for sure!  Thanks so much for sharing, Kim.

Very delicious.  I used 1 tbsp of margarine and 1 tbsp of olive oil and that was enough. My husband said it was the best asparagus I have ever made.

This was good!  I just used a couple of Tablespoons of butter though - but other than that I followed it to a T. Oh - I don't think I cooked it for the full 10 minutes either.  More like 7?  Perfect.

Never really liked asparagus-until tonight. Yum! Used jarred minced garlic because that is what I had on hand, but worked fine. Cooled off quickly though, which was a little disappointing, otherwise terrific.

This is the best why to make asparagus.  You won't believe how good it tastes.  I made this last year for easter and my aunt loved it.  She's asked me to make it over last year when we've visited her and she's requested it for Easter again this year.

This was just so delicious! I left out the garlic out of pure laziness, and it was still full of flavor. I'm sure it would be even better with the garlic. I used a really good sea salt, it really accentuates the natural flavor of the veggie and you only have to use a tiny bit of salt.

This was great!  I used jarred minced garlic with Italian herbs, though.  Worked out great.  My hubby does not like asparagus, but says he can eat it any day as long as it's cooked like this:)

It's hard to go wrong with asparagus, but this recipe is perfect, because it is incredibly EASY.  Top to bottom -- it's done in 10 minutes.

We eat a lot of asparagus, so I wanted to try something a little different. I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly but didn't cook it for the full 10 minutes. I'll make this again.

Delicious!  The only thing I did different was to microwave the asparagus in a little bit of water for 4 minutes, then I drained it and prepared it as directed.

I used to HATE asparagus, but after I prepared it this way for my husband I will now eat it more often. This is a really good recipe, even my young boys ate it and would've had more had there been any!! (We added parmasan cheese as per other reeviews...yumm)

I read the reviews & used 1 lb of asparagus like the recipe submitter suggested in her review (she said allrecipes changed her recipe), it was very good but too oily. I will cut all the ingredients in half next time for 1 lb of asparagus. My husband chowed down on this, he never does that with veggies! We enjoyed. Thanks.

This was a perfect side to a baked pasta dish!  I will agree with the reviews that recommend putting the garlic in later in the process and using a pound of asparagus.

This was good.  Make sure you don't burn the garlic - that was bad. :)  (I had to start over.)  I'll make again as a side to steak & garlic mashed potatoes.

Very tasty, but I wish I put the garlic in towards the end of the cooking time as it did get a bit too dark.   Maybe next time I will try using medium heat instead of medium high.

My family loves this!!  To change the taste a bit, I sprinke a bit of ground rosemary on them.  (ground rosemary is sometimes hard to find, so if you have a food processor (I use the "magic bullet") just grind up some dried rosemary sticks.  DELICIOUS!

This is the only way my kids will eat asparagus.  I also add only a TBS or less of olive oil.  Always turns out great.

Let me start by saying that I do not like asparagus.  I had some in the fridge that was going bad, so I gave this recipe a try.  I LOVED IT!  Everyone ate it up and it was requested the next night.  The only thing I did different was using tripple the garlic.  Oh, I also used Kosher Salt (not sure if it is the same as course salt).  I thought it might be too salty, but it wasn't.

This recipe was delicious! We sprinkled the spears with crumbled bacon after they came out of the frying pan and that just added to the flavor.

OMG! Loving it. I actually sauted the garlic as the recipe stated, then let it sit in the oil on the stove for several hours until I was ready to make dinner. I thought this would give the oil a more intense garlic flavor. I also added a bit more garlic than the recipe required. A definate remaker.

This is a good way to prepare asparagus.  I used only a tablespoon of oil and 1/2 tablespoon butter, and it was plenty.  I liked the garlic.  I under-cooked it so it was a little too crispy (my fault).  Better under-done than over, when it comes to veggies anyways.  Served this with Chicken Dijon from this site and whole wheat fettucini.

This was good.  I used way less butter and oil, but it was still a little too greasy for us.  If I make this again, I will use the the oil and butter very sparingly.

Very good but I found it a bit salty. Perhaps next time I will cut the salt in half. But, I don't normally season with a lot of salt.

Superb!  I added a little bit of extra garlic and unknowingly put in a pound of asparagus instead of the half pound called for in the recipe.  Still, there was the perfect amount of sauce to cover the asparagus.  I will definitely make this again.

This is so good that although I think I'm making enough for a couple of days, there are never any leftovers the first time around.  I've already made it twice in the last 4 days.  Thanx for the quick and savory recipe.

This was really good--I didn't give it five stars because I think 10 minutes is too long to cook it, the recipe calls for way too much fat, and there should be a note telling you to stir, stir, stir to keep the garlic from burning.  I made this with a whole pound of asparagus and didn't double the fat, and it was plenty.  I wouldn't hesitate to cut the butter and oil in half next time.  Also, the finished product is quite salty, but we loved it!

delicious! i only cooked the asparagus for about 3 minutes, ten would have way overcooked it. i also added in some fresh baby spinach at the end and tossed it about until the spinach was just wilted.

I don't like asparagus much & even I ate four of these... Wonderful flavor! I do think the cooking time was a bit too long but, other than that, the recipe remains unchanged in my file.

Quick and Easy and adds a very light yet distinct complimentary flavor to the asparagus.
A little too much butter however for my tastes.

I am pretty new to the world of asparagus, it just has never been appealing to me.  I made this tonight and I really enjoyed the recipe.  I thought that it tasted really nice and is a great side dish.  My husband told me to make this again!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!:)

This was a very good recipe.  I plan to make it again.  It has a very good flavor.  The one thing I did not like is that the garlic burns.  The recipe calls for the garlic to be added once the butter has melted, but my husband suggest that it be added in the beginning with the unmelted butter.

This recipe is simply incredible!  It is very simple, but delicious.  We serve this to company all the time and even people who have always said that they "hated" asparagus like it!  We chop the asparagus into bite size pieces before pan frying, which makes it less awkward to eat.  Fabulous!!

I don't like asparagus, but I loved this dish. 

The only thing I would change is to cut back or omit the butter, it was a little too greasy.

My husband raved about this, too. There weren't any leftovers at all from this.

Thanks for making asparagus edible to me, as it is a heathly food.

Excellent recipe.  Tastes great.  Make sure the garlic is spread evenly across the bottom of the pan to prevent clumping.  I also like it cooked only about 6-8 minutes or it becomes too mushy.

I did not even 
like asparagus until I found this recipe.  I have never used the butter to make this, so I can imagine that it would be even tastier with.  Thanks to the reviewer suggestion of slicing on the diagonal before cooking, that made it so much easier to cook.

the asparagus turned out crispy!  I used a pepper flavored oil and added red pepper flakes as we like spice.  Thanks for the idea - great change from the usual steamed veggies.

Delicious...Asparagus is one of our favorite vegies, but this adds such a great taste to it.  I always put garlic and olive oil on most of my green vegies, this is especially great with fresh spinach.  My teenage daughter is now starting to enjoy asparagus so new ways to make it are always fun.
Thank you Kim

I tried making this twice and  followed the directions exactly and still they were overcooked. I don't know what happened! I love Asparagus and have never made them myself and was very disappointd with the results.  I haven't been cooking very long so I attribute the disaster to my own skills...

Asparagus is my favorite vegetable and now this is my favorite way to prepare it. Its so easy to make and tastes incredible. The only thing I changed was the amount of asparagus.  I used 2 bunches and it was perfect.

very easy, make sure & cook asparagus for full 10 minutes. Didn't use the butter, olive oil was enough. Made again with both and didn't add the garlic until the end, it's great with just olive oil or the combo. Nice easy and delicious side dish. Want to try with green beans.

Very easy to prepare;  I did not use butter at all.  I browned the garlic a little, which left almost a peanutty after-taste on the asparagus.  YUMMY!

We made this to serve as a side dish to a fabulous beef tenderloin recipe - they were very good together, like something you would eat at an upscale steakhouse. I thought the recipe called for too much butter, but overall it had a nice fresh flavor. With a reduction in butter and a squeeze of lemon, I'd give this recipe 5 stars. We will definitely make this one again.

i really liked this, but would reduce the amount of butter next time.  i usually just steam asparagus so this was sort of a decadent treat.

This was very good and probably the best way I've tried asparagus.  I cooked it for the 10 minutes but could have done only 7-8 and it wouldn't have started to shrivel.

Definitely cut back on the butter.  No need to use 1/4 cup.  Use 1 or 2 tbsp and you will be fine.  Cook medium not medium high if your cooking for 10 minutes or your garlic will burn.

i love using garlic & it works great with this recipe! *one note is that my store only had pencil thin asparagus which shrank to half it's diameter. next time i'll make sure to hunt down asparagus that has a thicker stalk. thank you kim!

This tasted great but I really think the sauce warrants alot more asparagus than called for.  Otherwise it is way to greasy.  Needs a major drainage of the grease.  But the flavor was wonderful after I drained off the fat.

I thought this tasted GREAT!  And, even better, all the ingredients are on hand (if you have asparagus you want to cook, that is).  My only problem was that there was definitely way too much salt.  Next time I'll cut the salt at least in half and then season as needed.  The garlic turns out perfect in this.. nice and crunchy and flavorful.  A keeper - thanks!!

I have served this for Sunday dinner company several times, because it is a great last minute fresh veggie addition to my make ahead menu.  Everyone, even picky eaters love it.  I have been asked for the recipe twice!  I cook it about 7-8 minutes to keep it crisp-tender.

This tasted O.K. but there was too much salt for my taste.  Also I had a hard time keeping the garlic from burning.

This was the best asparagus I've tasted. We only had 6 or 7 spears from our garden so we improvised and cut down on the butter (1 tbs) and the oil (1 tbs). We still used lots of garlic. Yum!

Fantastic recipe.  Made it for mother's day and my brother who said he hated asparagus ended up devouring 1/2 of the pan full!  Such an easy sidedish and very flavourful - will be a regular for guests!

Delicious! Everyone loved this. I have made this twice. The first time I followed the directions to the T but it came out super salty. The second time I omitted the salt, I also only used a quick drizzle of olive oil and it came out PERFECT!!! I think the butter has just enough salt to flavor this recipe. Yum Yum!

Excellent!  This recipe has made asparagus a staple in our household!  Only thing I changed is that I didn't have coarse salt so I used regular table salt.  Kim this is one of the best recipes I have made from this site!!

Very good! I used a full pound of asparagus. I probably cooked it too long because it was so limp. The second time I made it I shortened the cooking time. My son said he liked it better mushy!! You just can't go wrong with something buttery, salty, & garlicky!!!

We all enjoyed this recipe, but it was very salty.  Next time I make it, I will cut the salt in half.  Also, if you peel the ends of the asparagus stalks, the teder part that is left cooks very quickly and absorbs more salt than the tips.  In the future I will cut the stalks in half and add the peeled portions towards the end.

Loved this.  Used more than 15 spears of asparagus but kept everything else the same, which turned out great.  My husband, who supposedly doesn't like asparagus, scarfed this down!  Plus, this was VERY easy and quick.

I made this last night for dinner and it was fantastic.  My boyfriend who claimed he didn't like asparagus scarfed it down.  I made with grilled strip steaks and used the mixture left in the pan to sautee the steaks for about a minute per side before serving them.  They gave the steak a yummy garlic flavor.

My new favorite way to cook asparagus!  I will never steam it again.  This seems to concentrate the flavor and it lacked that mushy stringy texture you can sometimes get from steaming.  I used lemon pepper and added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice at the end.  We couldnt get enough.  I also cut my spears into about 1 inch size chunks, as it made it easier to saute them.

I first served this asparagus dish with fish, and my kids went crazy over the meal.  I was afraid somebody had substituted Stepford children for my own!  However, I've made the asparagus again, and it's true -- they really do like it!

YUM!  After years of boiling my poor asparagus, I've found a great new cooking method.  The taste is out of the world -- the addition of garlic, etc really brings out the flavor of the asparagus.  Highly recommended.

Since I had never had asparagus I did not know what to expect in the taste, but the recipe was easy to prepare.  I don't know if I cooked it too long or the heat was too high (medium), but it turned out a little soft, but all in all not too bad.

This was a wonderful new way to make aspargus.  I did screw up by cooking the aspargus too long and it did get a little mushy but the taste was wonderful.  Make sure you follow the directions for cooking time.

I am not a big fan of asparagus and I loved this dish. I served it with mostaccioli and it was a big hit with my guests. This is especially great if you are on a low carb diet, otherwise it's not so healthy. But still very good.

I didn't put as much butter in because I thought a 1/4 cup was way too much. I think I added too much salt. Other than that it was pretty good. I think I'd rather go the healthy way and steam it though.

My husband, who is an asparagus lover, really enjoyed this recipe, although his first reaction wass, "I guess this isn't good for me, eh?"  I tend to agree with that assessment.  Although it was tasty (coming from one who doesn't love asparagus), I generally like to think that my veggies are good, rather than bad, for me.  I probably won't be making this again.

I used frozen asparagus, which I thawed and drained in the sink.  It worked just as well.  I drizzeled with a simple lemon mustard sauce.

I stuck to the recipe (although I would recommend more garlic if you like garlic) and I used a pound of asparagus, and it worked out fine.  I burned the garlic, then I proceeded to burn the asparagus, not terribly though. It was "browned" I thought. :) The recipe was so simple, and it would have been great had I not burned...uh... browned it. Enjoy :)

Mine turned out to be a little on the oily side. However, I used frozen asparagus for this recipie because that was all I had on hand. I assume it would taste much better with fresh asparagus since it would cook properly.

It was a DISASTER......but I am sure that it was my fault.  I cooked it too long so pay attention to the reviews that mention to not overcook.  It was a brown, limp, charred mess.  I will definitely try it again.....I am going to get this one right!

OOOOHHHHH!  These were divine. I've been eating raw or steamed veggies for so long (to save cooking time) that I'd forgotten how lovely cooked & flavored veggies are!! I used half the salt and it was good.  I had a LOT of butter left in the pan.  Scaled to 5 - it was barely enough for hubby and me. So make lots!
