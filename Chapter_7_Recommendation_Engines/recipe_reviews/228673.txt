Excellent! Use 1 pork loin and chicken breast instead in sausage. Also added some parsley, used canola oil, and didn't use beans. Just awesome.

I enjoyed this. I didn't use sausage to keep it truly a vegetable stew. Also, I cooked the potatoes inside the stew. It just seemed logical. Thank you for the recipe.

I tried this today for me and my housemates. They totally loved it. I made it without zucchini and green beans though because I can't find them. I substituted the olive oil with vegetable oil. Nevertheless, it taste really good.
