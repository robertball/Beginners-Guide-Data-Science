This was wonderful! Rather than wasting the butter by using it to baste the fish while grilling, I made a simple butter sauce with the herbs & some reduced white wine & poured it over the halibut after it was plated. This is my first time cooking halibut & I'm thrilled this is the recipe I chose. Thanks so much:o)

Tried this recipe with halibut steaks and it was very tasty. The seasoned butter does not overpower the flavor of the fish. Used fresh minced onion in place of dried and a combo of salt and garlic powder for the garlic salt. Stay close to the grill because there will be flare-ups. I would definitely make this again.

I used swordfish, then accidentally substituted basil for the black pepper (don't ask) ... but it turned out fantastic! I'm not a huge fan of seafood, but this was incredibly flavorful and non-fishy tasting. Went perfectly over rice pilaf, and looks beautiful on the plate. Thanks!

The marinade was excellent.  My husband said it was one of the best he's tasted.  
I didn't have parsley, so I omitted that.
I used onion powder instead of minced onion (tasted great anyway).
I also didn't need that much butter; I used less than 3/4 cup.
I microwaved the butter ahead of time so it would mix well with the other dry ingredients too.
Easy & delicious!

I am a fan of cooking good fish very simply, without a bunch of sauces and goop. This, however, was so perfect. The butter was fabulous on top!  A couple of changes...  - I halved the amount of butter. You definitely don't need that much butter.  - I doubled the lemon juice.  - I only had garlic powder and that worked fine. - I accidentally put in about a tablespoon of sugar but it was still great!  I didn't use all of the butter on the halibut, and ended up melting the rest and serving it on the table. Guests poured it on bread and veggies! Absolutely fabulous!!

I had never made halibut before, sounded yummy enough - my only complaint is it fell apart while it was cooking.  I haven't mastered the fish on the grill yet... always seems to make a mess!  
I think this recipe calls for quite a bit of butter... I made less than what the recipe called for and still had some left over.  Very tasty though.

Wow, so simple yet SO yummy. I cut the butter to a little less than 1/2 cup and it turned out great. Actually did it on my stove using my grill pan with wonderful results. Perfect blend of spices for a delicate fish. Will be entertaining with this one again. :)

Excellent!  Everyone raved about it.  I made it with salmon and I didn't have dried minced onion so I just used onion powder.  It was very good!

Me and my husband decided to make fish for the first time. I went to the store and bought it fresh, and went home to make dinner. He wasn't especially fond of them, but he is a picky eater, I thought they were okay, I did like the seasoning, but we both agreed there was still a fishy taste. I may try again with this recipe as the base, but will be adding to it to try and change it to my liking more. Also, I cooked the steaks in foil packets at 325 for 25 minutes, they were AWESOME on texture. They stayed moist and came apart nicely!

We didn't think the recipe had much flavor, as the butter and seasonings melted off.  I probably won't make this one again.

This was EXCELLENT!  I enjoyed it very much. Used much less butter than was called for and it was just fine. I put this under the broiler for about 6-1/2 minutes on each side. Put the butter mixture on each side as I went along.  It was a little bit salty so I may just use minced garlic instead of garlic salt the next time I make it, and there will be many, many next times! Thank you, Lisa!

This was an excellent recipe for halibut on the grill! We made sure to put aluminum foil under the fish since we were nervous about the butter causing flare-ups. I'm only giving 4 stars instead of 5 because we ended up using about half of the butter sauce, even with adding more to the fish while it cooked. Very tasty and very moist. And for those reviewers that complain about their fish tasting "fishy", it's because the fish you bought wasn't fresh, not because of the recipe. We never by fish at the supermarket- always catch our own or go to a seafood market. When buying fish, always ask when and where it was caught. If they can't answer, don't buy it!

This was the best.  Instead of the minced onion and garlic salt, I just used minced garlic, as I try to reduce salt as much as possible.  My husband loved this and it may become one of our favourite meals.

This is a simple way to bring wonderful, delicate (moist!) flavor to white fish.  We eat LOTS of fresh fish, and I liked that this recipe enhanced that great fresh taste instead of smothering it.  I used Blue Marlin (swordfish), and served it on a bed of Mango/Peach Salsa with buttered brown rice.  It was really impressively good, I will be serving it to comapny for sure!

Was good, but didn't taste the marinade too much.  We used tilapia.  I'm not a big fish eater, and have recently been broadening my horizons.  Will cook again.

I am definitely NOT a fish lover but am trying to use different recipes to develop a taste for fish.  This recipe has me wanting to prepare it again!  Wow, it was delicious and easy to do.  The texture of halibut is what I had been searching for plus this herbed butter is fantastic!  My husband loves salmon so he will try using the butter on it next time he grills.

We eat tilapia at least once a week.  In Florida it is readily available and resonably priced, so this is the fish I used.   My husband has some favorite recipes but I am always trying to come up with something new.  I used my indoor stove top "BAR-B-Q" but made the recipe exactly as written.  It is definately a keeper.  Served with a fresh salad, parsley roasted potatoes and fresh carrots. Mild but flavorful.

This was good but seemed to be lacking something.  It seemed bland.  I softened the butter on the counter for a couple of hours.  Then I mixed it in a bowl with the herbs.  I rubbed the mixture on the Halibut and wrapped the fish in foil packets then grilled it for 5 minutes a side.   Next time I make this I will melt the butter before I mix the herbs with it and brush it on the Halibut.  I will make again with a few adjustments.
