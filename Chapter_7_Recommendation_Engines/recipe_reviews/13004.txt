Very good recipe.  I took some liberties as I was short on time, and still had a great result.  I used a large jar of purchased roasted red peppers.  I also used a large can of diced tomatoes, and veggie broth instead of chicken broth.  I ended up with all the ingredients simmering away in the pot and then used my immersion blender to puree everything right in the pot.  Excellent flavor and seasonings.  I also added some dry mashed potato flakes to thicken it up at the end instead of the butter/flour.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I really dislike tomato soup out of a can, but have had wonderful tomato soup in restaurants. This recipe was exactly what I was looking for! I made it for my book club and all the gals raved about it. I did make a few changes. First, I used canned diced tomatoes. I also sauted two chopped red peppers and used one roasted red pepper from a jar, putting them all in at the same time instead of reserving one for the end of the recipe. Instead of making the roux I added some cornstarch to a bit of the broth, stirred until smooth, and then mixed that into the soup. Finally, instead of the sour cream I added a few tablespoons of cream to the entire batch before serving. Wonderful!

This tasted like a soup you would get at a nice restaurant, with a lovely hue.  Based on other reviews, I used 4 red peppers and in place of fresh tomatoes (which are terrible this time of year, at least here) I used 2 (14 oz) cans of diced, peeled tomatoes.  I also did not reserve a pepper for use later.  People here at work that tasted it loved it as well.  Despite the effort (most of which is in the cooking time), this will be a soup I readily will make again.  In the future, I may or may not continue to use the roux (this time I did use it), but it looked ready to go without the roux being necessary.  Thanks, Carol!

An INSTANT hit! I make it at least 4 times every winter and everyone who tastes it ALWAYS has seconds! Here are my minor modifications:
1. I used 1 can of chopped tomatoes instead of peeling and seeding them myself (which took WAY too long). 
2. I added an extra red pepper (LOVE the taste of them. There is NO substitute for roasting your own peppers so take the time for this one.

Delicious soup. Used canned diced tomatoes as well as a huge jar of roasted red peppers. Added some heavy whipping cream, topped with sprigs of fresh basil. Plan on serving this at a holiday party.

very tasty soup indeed. I omitted the step of adding the tomatoes and onion to the broth and boiling. I just went straight to the puree and then placed evryhing back into the broth and simmered for 35 minutes.

Also I roasted all the vegaetables except for the tomatoes. This allowed for the onions to carmelize and the garlic to let out more flavor than jst crushed. The flavor improves with time. Served this soup at a church lunch and it was a hit.
Also did not have thyme so i subbed dried basil. For the salt I used coarse sea salt.

This recipe is excellent.  I used tomatoes I had frozen last summer and took the time to roast the red peppers instead of using jarred.  Used my immersion blender to meld the ingredients together and served with Bacon, Avocado, and Pepperjack Grilled Cheese Sandwiches also from AR. Terrific combination.  Thanks Carol!

I made this soup according to recipe (fresh tomatoes, fresh peppers I roasted myself), and it was good (but not great).  I would've used an additional pepper for more roasted red pepper flavor (and less chicken stock flavor).  Overall I found this soup to be a little bland, so I would also add more garlic, hot sauce, salt and pepper, etc.  It's also worth mentioning that this is a very labor-intensive soup to make...

this soup was really good! i served it with grilled cheese sandwiches. i made a few changes to save time: i used roasted red peppers from a bottle (trader joe's has good ones),  canned tomatoes (use a good brand- there is a difference!), and my wand blender to blend the soup (a potato masher would have worked, too). i brought leftovers to a couple of friends who had never had tomato soup before, and they just loved it! thanks for the recipe!

Made this for my boss (principal's day).  It is her favorite soup and she RAVED about it.  (Personally I don't like red pepper, so I didn't try it.) The entire faculty ate it up without leaving any leftovers.  So...this rating is from them.  Thanks for helping me out with the boss.  Thanks for the post.

This soup was fantastic!  The only change I made was to add a cup of milk at the very end to make it a little bit creamy.

I streamlined this recipe big-time - for ease as well as to use ingredients I had on hand.  In a nutshell,  I sautéed onions in olive oil –added the garlic, chopped, jarred roasted peppers, the chicken broth  and two  cups of tomatoes I put up from my garden. (This is for the recipe scaled down to 2 servings)  Added the thyme, salt, pepper and the hot sauce, but omitted the cayenne and sugar.  I let that simmer for about a half hour, then had Hubs puree it for me with the immersion blender.  The butter and flour were not necessary so I skipped that too. Delicious – robust, intense flavor, vivid red.  Garnished it with a crostini and a strip of roasted red pepper.

Healthy version: forget sugar. No sugar in any soup needed. Forget butter, use olive oil to cook onion and that is all. You can forget chicken broth as well. Vegetable broth will do. I don't add flour as well. Flour is needed to make a broth thicker. So, if you add less water, you will need less flour to make your water thicker. The point is why to add all those ingridients if you want to be healthy and not fat? I don't put sour cream either. But it's up to you. The MOST IMPORTANT: roast tomatoes as well. It brings flavor in cheap tomatoes that you can use for this soup. (Well, you not gonna use heirloom, correct?). Bottomline, you soup can be delicious and healthy at the same time. I changed the recipe and I do it the way I described and its awesome

Really enjoyed this soup.  Great taste, with a little kick.  I followed the ingredients exactly other than I had no hot pepper sauce, so I added a little dried pepper flakes.  I did change the way I cooked this slightly.  I pureed the vegetables after they had simmered for the first 25 minutes, before I added the stock.  This meant I could miss out the stage of having to strain the vegetables and then adding back to the stock once they had been pureed.  I doubled the batch of all ingredients, so that I had some left over to freeze.  (I freeze soup flat in ziplock bags, rather than tubs as it takes up so much less space in the freezer).  Just add soup to bag, push out excess air, and lie flat on a baking tray in the freezer.  Once frozen transfer to a small plastic tub upright in the freezer).

I have been looking for a red pepper soup similar to the one served at our favorite restaurant. The first time I made this recipe, it was good but missing something. The second time, I followed it exactly but threw in a carton of whipping cream (in place of the sour cream) at the end. That was the missing ingredient! It was amazing! This is THE best soup recipe I have found yet! Thanks for sharing.

This soup has a great flavor, but the instructions are a bit of a mess.  Taking out and adding in liquid is pointless.  Next time I make this I will leave the tomato juice in and add less broth.

Excellent soup.  Well worth the time.  I've made it a couple of times now and have figured out the changes that have made it the best yet.  1. 4 peppers. 2. 4 cups of chicken stock.  I wanted a thicker consistency.  3.  Didn't reserve a pepper - put all peppers in at once. 4. Used a hand blender to mix everything together.  I also made mini grilled cheese sandwiches and cut them into crouton size.  Threw them in right before serving.  Paired really nicely with the soup.  Enjoy!

This soup is so good that my 12 year old son requests it.  He likes it so much that he'll eat it two nights in a row (we have leftovers since there are only 3 of us).  While it is a little bit of work and takes some time, it is well worth it to all of us.  I use a 28 oz can of petite diced tomatoes, and 4 red peppers that I roast myself.  I added 2 tsp of dried basil and 1 tsp of dried oregano and increase the cayenne to 1/8 tsp and a couple of dashes of hot sauce.  We like it a little spicy, but even with these modifications, we don't find it hot.  Excellent recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

This was fantastic.  Like another reviewer, I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes (without the juice) and I used roasted red peppers from a jar (made it a lot easier and far less time); the soup was absolutely fantastic!  Rave reviews from my guests.

Very good soup.  To cut down the prep time, use an immersion blender.  After roasting and peeling peppers, I used one pot.  Sauteed the onions, peppers, and garlic, added broth (I used veg. broth) and spices.  I left out sugar and used a combo of fresh and canned tomatoes.  It's hard to find a good tomato in MD. this time of yeare!

This is an excellent soup!! I felt like a professional chef after serving a soup like this.  I made a different soup every day this week, and this was our favorite one. To make it even more healthy, I left out the sour cream and added  1 1/2 cup of milk to the roux before mixing it in with the rest of the soup. It's standard procedure in a lot creamy soup recipes, and it worked great with this one.

I made this recipe today and it is fantastic.  I used red pepper packed in oil instead of fresh red peppers and it came out great.  I didn't have to thicken it but I did put in a cup of milk.  Great color and texture.

I love this soup.  It takes a LONG time to prepare and cook.   It is very labor intensive and it makes a big mess.  It does taste good so I will make it again.  Next time I will plan my time better.  The 15 min prep time is not even close to accurate.   Also, next time I will leave out the extra roasted pepper added at the end.  My kids did not like the lumpy pepper in their tomato soup because they are used to a smooth soup

This is an awesome tomato soup recipe.  I roasted the tomatoes along with the peppers which really brought out the flavor of the tomatoes and made it easier to peel and seed them. Roasting them also releases some of the juices in the tomatoes and helps shorten the time needed to reduce the vegetables in step 2.  I made this for a cooking client who is a big fan of tomato soup and she loved it also.

Absolutely to die for soup! I add extra tomatoes and puree all the red peppers. When its done, I serve on top of a bed of cheese tortellini. I swear its the same recipe as my local gourmet soup restaurant.

As written, I found the recipe rather too mild tasting - just not enough flavour. I ended up reducing it somewhat further and adding some tomato sauce and a little extra of all the spices. I will definitely make it again, but next time with more tomato and an extra pepper. It ended up lovely regardless but I think it will be better next time.

Instead of thickening with the roux, I used skim milk powder for a bit of creaminess. 

I also didn't like the idea of cooking it down, adding stock THEN pureeing it (I don't have an immersion blender). I cooked the veggies, pureed them THEN added the stock.

This is a fabulous soup! I added a little more spice, including one small hot pepper, and increased both the amount of tomatoes and the red peppers, for a thicker soup. Delicious!
If freezes well too - always a plus for our family.

This tangy and delicious soup was great!   My kids both loved it (11&5) both are picky soup eaters.  I only had 2 red peppers and I used a can of diced tomatoes to save time.  I thickened only a bit with cornstarch and some of the broth that I held over .  This will definately be a soup I make again and again.

Love it! Of course I made some changes such as adding roasted eggplant, adding a load more roasted garlic and sub-ed goat milk cheese for sour cream but the base line of this recipe is awesome. The more roasted everything you can use the better

This soup was a great way to use up the tomato surplus from my garden.  I roasted the tomatoes alongside the red peppers to increase the delicious, smoky flavor.  To roast: I halved the tomatoes, used a skewer help seed them, gave a light spray of canola oil and placed cut side down on the grill until the skins started to wrinkle and the tomatoes softened a bit.  Once they cooled, I peeled off the skin, chopped and added the tomatoes as directed in the recipe.  I cut down on the cooking time to account for the fact that the tomatoes were pre-roasted.
My only complaint is that there was a bit too much Thyme for my taste.  I'll probably cut that down to a 1/2 teaspoon next time.  Otherwise, the recipe was fantastic.  Will definitely make this again!

I made this for dinner tonight, and it was delicious! It had a great combination of flavor, and wasn't hard. It would have been nice, though, if a time had been included for how long to broil the peppers in order to blacked them.

This just might be my favorite soup ever! I used dried minced garlic instead of fresh garlic and I pureed all the red peppers instead of reserving one.

made this for 3 and was very good. didnt mess with the seeding/peeling tomatoes just chopped them up retaininng their goodness and flavour. wouldnt add salt just cracked pepper. perfect serving portion. Used chilli powder instead of cayenne and hot pepper sauce (hard to find in france). lovely with grated parmesan on top instead of sour cream. Will try without butter n flour nxt time. Thanks! x

Very satisfiying.  I felt lazy so used canned tomatoes which meant there wasn't much juice to boil out so was much quicker to make.  I roasted my own peppers which really isn't difficult and is much cheaper.  Was very tempted to put feta in it but it really didn't need it so I served it with grilled cheese that I'd made with a little feta added in.

I've made this soup a half dozen times since I found the recipe. It tastes wonderful and keeps really well. 
You can also use this as a pasta sauce, just by using about half the chicken stock and thickening the soup a bit more with flour.

This soup was so delicious after step 3, I didn't even do steps 4-6.  It made for a different style...more chunky soup.  Also, very healthy!

Very Good thank you. Made this with extra tomatoes on hand from canning. Since I had a bumper crop of red peppers this season too, this was a good recipe to try. I added more roasted red pepper, used only 1 cup stock, tweaked the seasoning. Next time I will remove some of the processing steps and time.

super yummy, but not an easy soup to make nor is it a very cost effective soup.  6 cups of soup for about $10.  not sure if i would do it again, but it certainly was delicious.  maybe when red bell peppers and tomatoes are on sale :)

i thought the soup would be too runny so i tried to boil off some of the chicken broth, but the roux made it perfectly thick (duh . . .)  thanks for a great recipe!

I altered this recipe a bit.  I roased the tomatoes with some garlic and the thyme befor adding to the soup.  It was a little blah for me, so I added some Italian seasoning toward the end, omitted the sour cream, and topped it with homemade garlic croutons.

Delicious soup!  It is very time consuming to make but tastes so good!  I added some heavy cream instead of the sour cream and blended all of the peppers instead of reserving some.  I also added 3 tomatillos and one cayenne pepper for some added flavor.  Will make again!

Absolutely amazing soup.  The cayenne gives it a wonderful kick, it's not a eye-watering or nose-clearing one, but something more delicate that brings out the rest of the ingredients.  I have given this to people who hate anything remotely spicy and they love it.  Do not be put off by adding the cayenne!

This soup is pretty good, though I have certainly had better tomato and red pepper soups.  I thought tomato should have been a more featured taste and perhaps a bit more of an herb finish (basil maybe?).  All in all, a pretty spicy soup that is only moderately interesting.  Given that it's very labor intensive, I will not make this again.

This is a good recipe with great flavors although I think the recipe is little more complicated than it needs to be. Since you are pureeing the tomatos, I wouldn't bother with peeling them. Also, I didn't bother with the roux step, added all the peppers at the beginning,and used about half the hicken broth, pureed it all, and ended up with a rich and thick enough soup with much less fuss. Enjoy!

Well here I am two hours later with my soup. Tip - peeling tomatoes is a lot easier if you drop them for a minute in boiling water and easier still if you buy them in a can already peeled. This time, regrettably, I chose the former as a neighbor had given us a bag of tomatoes and five red peppers (hence my seeking out this recipe). Second tip, let the tomatoes cool prior to peeling, or like me, you'll be typing the rest of the day with burnt fingers.  So... Followed the recipe, all went well, but even from the outset I had my concerns about all that chicken stock, but being a novice in the kitchen, I figured you guys probably know more than I do. Guess not. The soup had a greasy film of chicken fat on top and had an unmistakable chicken broth aftertaste. Congrats to the cook who thought to use vegatable broth. Should've listened to you. In an attempt to salvage this mess, I pureed and added a cup of mild salsa, a can of diced chili ready tomatoes and three quarters of a cup of heavy cream. Not bad I suppose. At least I can only just taste that damned chicken broth now. But after all the effort, and clean up, opening a box of Pacific's organic red pepper and tomato soup would have clearly been the smart option.  One thing I did discover (before looking up how to peel tomatoes) is you can actually take the skin off a fairly firm romaine using nothing other than your standard issue household potato peeler. Who'd have thunk it?

My family loved this recipe!! I didn't have  fresh tomatos so I used canned and I smashed them the best I could and it came out like a chunky tomato which my husband loved. This tasted like a gourmet soup. I loved how roasted red peppers added great flavor. My kids loved this too.

Excellent soup!  

I added a little bacon and Smoked Gouda cheese (trying to replicate a soup served at a local cafe) - it turned out excellent!

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

I was worried while this was cooking because the tomato seemed very dominant and harsh and it smelled like pizza, but after simmering the pepper flavor came out nicely. It did seem like a lot of work for a simple supper though. My husband though it would be a good base for the addition of a lot of other vegetables.

This, was a lot of work. (i used fresh garden tomatoes) But it was so worth it! It turned out really great. While it was simmering i added some cheddar cheese, and stirred the sour cream in as well. I am freezing this soup so i have a quick and easy meal for myself at work.
This is the first soup i have ever made from scratch, and i am so proud, because it is wonderful. Thankyou for this recipe.!! :-)

Lovely lovely soup. Aroma and texture are wonderful. The whole family enjoyed this one. Even those who did not think they liked roasted red peppers! I roasted the peppers in a 400 degree oven for 40 min. Next time I will increase the time a little and perhaps turn the peppers over during cooking. I think when blackened flavour is intensified. Thanks

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly, and while I thought it was quite flavorful, I also didn't think it was worth the prep time. I tried it with jarred roasted peppers, and didn't think they were a good substitute either. However, I recently discovered 'Flame Roasted Peppers' on the olive bar at my local Meijer, and, wow, they are REALLY good in this soup! Ok, so nothing beats roasting your own peppers on a charcoal grill, but this is a great substitute for using in the colder months or when you're pushed for time. They also help make the soup the most beautiful deep red color (see my pic). I now make this every couple of weeks. Thanks, Carol!

This was the best tomato soup ever.  My husband, who dosen't usually like tomato soup, said this has to be the best soup of any kind, and we have to have this often.

WOW I love this sight but rarely rate anything this is top notch!! I used tomatoes from the garden and instead of the peeling/seeding I just put them thru my juicer. Didnt have all red peppers so one orange,yellow,red. Also added fresh chopped basil and shredded zuchinni(got use it up) I did not puree the vegetables (like it chunky).  I'm not a tomoto fan but this I have to make more when the rest of the tomatoes ripen its soooooo good!!!!!

Wow.  I mean, really.  Wow.  I used canned tomatoes, because they're cheaper (usually), and fresh cracked black pepper to season.  Fantastic recipe, and so healthy!  Next time, I'm going to roast a head of garlic and try adding that as a variation.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I loved this soup... as did my family.  I left out the hot spices (b/c of my 2 yr old), and added an extra clove of garlic.  I also added some extra veggies that I needed to use up.  The result was a fantastic.  I did not use the flour/ water, sugar or sour cream.  We are health nuts and I try to use as few "extras" as possible.  I will definitely be using this recipe again!

We were served a similar soup on a visit to Canada. We enjoyed it so much that I went looking for a recipe and found it on you website. I've made it several times and find it excellent cold weather fare

I've made this 4 times & have tweaked it each time.  The base recipe is solid so you can dabble with minor changes & the flavor is still great.  I now make it with 3 pounds of tomato, 4 large red bell peppers and increase the garlic/onion/spices in proportion.  I roast my onion & garlic along with the tomato in olive oil that has been infused with cilantro & roasted onion.  I add more cayenne & hot sauce(s) to give it extra punch & leave out the butter & flour.  It is tasty with or without sour cream.  This is a solid recipe with easy prep.  Lots of flexibility to tweak ingredients & dabble in spices without losing the great basic flavor.

This was a tasty soup! I roasted a red pepper earlier today and was looking for something to use it in. It does have a slight heat kick to it, though, but the color is brilliant. I might post a picture tomorrow. I thought the directions were a little much. So, I sauteed the onion in the olive oil for about 5 minutes and then added the garlic for about another minute. Then, I threw all of the ingredients in my Vitamix blender for 9 minutes as it has a heating function. I made 1/3 of a recipe and just rounded the ingredients up or down to make it easier. I knew that amount would fit in my blender also. I got about 4 soup cup type servings still, cutting back the recipe. I ate it with sesame crackers, but for a heavier meal this would be great with a grilled cheese.

Fabulous soup. Used 3 small red and 3 small yellow peppers, roasted and peeled. Five small-ish cloves of garlic, crushed. One 28-oz can diced tomatoes. 8 cups turkey stock (home made). A hefty dash of chipotle chili powder (instead of hot sauce and cayenne). And used an immersion blender to blitz. Took more salt than I thought it would to bring it up to my taste. Served with a little sour cream, and added a tablespoon of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Had great body and was hearty without being heavy. Delicious!

Good flavor. I used a seeded, chopped jalepeno in place of the hot sauce & cayenne. A great soup for when you have a cold, like I do right now.

I had several tomatoes and red peppers that needed to be used and this was perfect.  I cut the amount of broth in half and did not add the butter, flour or sour cream and it was still fantastic.

I used veg stock to make it vegetarian.  I also didn't bother peeling or seeding my tomatoes; the roasted peppers lend enough sugar to counteract any bitterness.  I also didn't entirely puree this - I like a little texture.  FABULOUS recipe!

This soup was great! I roasted the peppers and onions (per another reviewer's suggestion), used two cans of diced tomatoes and just one can (about 2 cups) of vegetable broth. I also doubled the spices, garlic and finished by adding half and half at the end to desired taste. Garnished with croutons. YUM!

Delicious recipe. I made with canned diced tomatoes, but did roast my own peppers. I also left out the hot sauce. Otherwise followed recipe exactly. Had a small kick to it, but not too much (I'm not a super spicy girl). I'm taking this to a soup exchange so we'll see how others like it. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent flavor.  It was worth the extra work.  I added more cayenne than was called for and also I didn't end up needing the flour thickening at the end - it was just fine as it was.  Thanks for sharing - wonderful flavors!

A delicious soup that can be easily doctored up for your own preferences.  I had no sour cream so I sprinkled some goat cheese on top.  It added creaminess and a contrasting taste.  Yum!!

First of all this has great potential however I am giving it 3 stars b/c it is lengthy, messy and I almost burned myself trying to puree the whole soup (chef error...I read the directions wrong).  The steam made the lid pop off and the soup went everywhere...almost burning me in the process. Made this today on a smaller scale and used store bought roasted red peppers to save a little time.     Will probably not make again not really worth the hassle.  Thanks for sharing though!

My family loved this soup, so much better than plain tomato. I made grilled cheese sandwiches on the side to dip. I did 2 large peppers, added some basil, and no onions. And the sour cream topped it off.  This is a fantastic meal, perfect for these cold winters!!!

This was good, but I couldn't get it as smooth as I'd like (even after using my emersion blender). It was ok for a change, but I've gotta say... nothing beats Campbells.

I liked this fresh tasting soup. I used my own canned tomatoes (about 4 cups) and did not use the roux. It was quite thick without it. The pepper taste was subtle. I will make it again for our cold winter night suppers.

I've made this many times and while it does take some time, it is worth it. Instead of peeling and seeding tomatoes, I just put the blended mixture through a sieve before adding back to the pot. You can also add some cream before serving for a milder taste. Great with a savory bread and salad! It freezes well too. Great recipe, thanks!

very good....I'm not a huge pepper fan, but found this recipe incredibly delicioius! I had some peppers that I needed to use up and this was a perfect plan. I took the advice of others and used a 28oz. can of diced tomatoes. I didn't have 3 red peppers, so I used one red, one orange and one yellow. I honestly don't know if it wouldn't made a difference, but it tasted great. I also put all the peppers into the soup right at the beginning, instead of reserving one for later as I didn't want the chunks of pepper. We didn't have sour cream the night we made the soup, but picked some up the next day, and to be honest, this really sweetened the deal. Its a must with this soup....amazing! Thanks for the recipe!

This was fantastic.  I added some thinly sliced scallions as garnish. Have already made it twice. Was a big hit with my husband/

Flavorful & delicious. I highly recommend this shoup.  I used jarred red bell peppers (plus two fresh) & fire roasted tomatoes.  Served with sour cream, but is also good plain. I pureed most of the solids and added the peppers that I roasted myself at the end.

Nice. I went easy on the thyme and left some of my veggies chunky for texture. Thanks for the recipe. :)

This was wonderful.  My 4, 6, and 8 year old also loved it.  I didn't use as much chicken broth because I like a thicker soup and I never added the hot pepper sauce to keep the kids happy.

I would not add as much pepper/cayenne.  I didn't even add the Tabasco and it was still a bit too spicy.  I added the instant potatoes at end to thicken.  We really liked it.

AMAZING!  Most likely the best roasted red pepper soup I have ever had!  I used fresh ingredients from my garden, using 6 peppers and about 12 roma tomatoes.  Other than that, quantities were kept the same.  When I roasted the peppers I left them sit in paper bags over night to really savour the juices.

This recipe has fabulous flavor.  To save time I used 2 12oz jars roasted peppers and 2 cans of Italian stewed tomatoes.Olnly used 4 cups chicken broth.  Pureed it right in the pot at the end and added 1/4 cup cream.  Did not need to thicken with flour and butter.

Not worth the time and effort. I tried it both ways, with and without cream in it. It is better without it. I thought the taste was somewhat bland. I ended up adding some balsamic vinegar and extra sugar to give it some taste. Topped it with fresh basil. It tastes more like tomato soup than roasted pepper soup.

Great solid recipe. Do use canned tomatoes - they are packaged during their peak season and taste best.

As others had recommended, I used canned diced tomatoes rather than fresh (not so great this time of year), but it still seemed a little low on 'tomato-ness,' so I added a can of plain tomato sauce and it thickened it into a perfect texture. This also blended easier than some other soups I've made. 

I made it for my parents' visit to my first "real apartment," and they were very impressed! Perfect with sandwiches and a loaf of crusty bread for a nice lunch on a cold day. I will be making this again.

I made this yesterday and it was great, but I am not sure how much better would have been had I used the exact ingredients and method of cooking. Did not have all the time requried so I took some shortcuts as other recommended: I used one can of Campbell concentrates soup and one can of chopped tomatoes (what I had in the pantry) I had only two bell peppers that I roasted directly on the stove until charred. I used only 1/2 an onion but one more garlic clove (I loved the stuff) I cooked the onions anbd garlic and added the spices and the tomatoes (canned) and cooked for 25 minutes. At this point I place in the blender to puree, and returned to the pan to which I added only two cups of chicken broth (did not have more and did not want to add water). I cooked for 15 minutes, and I thickened with a roux made with 1 T. butter, 2 T flour and 1 cup of warm milk. I served with a dollop of Greek yogurt (I use instead of sour cream all the time)and chopped cilantro. The spices were fantastic and the soup came up great. The four stars is for the modifications. i will try again without any changes to see if the original can get the 5 stars. I served this with a salad made with lettuce, tomatoes,olives and topped with abalones and hard boil egg with home made mayonnaise. A real treat for my two guys at home!

This is quite possibly the best tomato soup I've ever had!  I used roasted red peppers from a jar (Trader Joe's), but didn't change anything else.  So, so good with a gooey grilled cheese sandwich, total perfection!

I was in a hurry so I used two cans Campbel's tomato soup and about a third of the other ingredients and ate it with a toasted cheese sandwich.  It was ultimate delish.  I'm sure it would be better if I actually followed the recipe, but even with Campbel's and those other ingredients it was still very good.  I also didn't put the red pepper in a bag, but scraped the insides off the peel after broiling and it seemed to work fine.

As made, this was very good, but not quite excellent. It ages well, and is actually much improved the next day. The second time I made it I used half thyme and half basil, and grated some parmesan cheese instead of sour cream - then it was excellent!

This soup is so delicious! I just got done making it and I really love it. I did add some chili powder and I used Tobasco sauce for the hot sauce. I think that the next time I do this I will use canned tomatoes and already roasted peppers as preparing those things was really messy and took too much time for me. Otherwise, super-awesome recipe!

What a deliciously bold flavored soup!  This recipe was simple and easy although it did create quite a lot of dishes! I did not add the thickening agent at the end because I felt it was a great consistancy as is. Served with sour cream and cilantro- Family LOVED it!

This is a great recipe, but so much depends on the quality of the ingredients. The first time I made this, I used fresh tomatoes, peppers & basil from a nearby farm. It was the best tomato soup I've ever had, fantastic plain, or with added wild rice. I've made it since using produce from the grocery store, and haven't been as impressed--the flavor lacks the dimension fresh produce gives. It's still a great soup, but do it justice and buy fresh produce!

I have had so many complements on this soup and I never have left overs, even when I double the recipe.  I also add cooked tortellini once the soup starts to simmer. It's a big hit.--Denise--

I made this delicious soup for lunch today with a few alterations.  I used a jar of roasted red peppers, 1 clove minced garlic, 1 large (28 oz) can of tomatoes, and added 1 can of evaporated milk to the roux instead of the sour cream at the end (just to use what I had in my pantry. Hate running to the store for 1 thing. )  My husband and I really enjoyed this soup. I am sure it is probably even better with fresh veggies.  I will be making this again very soon.  Next time, I will puree the veggies before adding the chicken stock, etc. to reduce the time needed and to speed up the process for a busy weeknight meal.

this is SO good - and it's not even done cooking yet! my husband and i can't stop tasting it! i have tried many soup recipies and they usually turn out just so-so or not very good. this one has so much flavor!
(the only reason i did not give it 5 stars is b/c it does take a lot of effort.)

I had some tomatoes and bell peppers in the fridge that I needed to use and did an ingredient search and this is what came up. What a treat!! I used a wand blender directly in the pot. Otherwise, followed the recipe to a tee. Excellent soup!

Yummy.  We added tabasco sauce and garnished with whole yogurt and green onions for a healthy twist.  Very easy and flavourful.  Will definitely make again.

This is AWESOME!  A lot of work, but worth it.  Next time I'll use canned tomatoes as others have said (especially since the fresh tomatoes in winter aren't even all that flavorful).  Thanks Carol Crane!

This soup is fantastic....takes time to prepare, but well worth it. I have made it 3 times. I double the recipe, and can some for later, just as easy to make 2 batches as one. I use canned tomatoes after the first time, still great! Sometimes I add a tsp. of liquid smoke that is also very good!

This recipe is delicious!!  I would recommend roasting the tomatoes, however roast the tomatoes for only 15 seconds.

I, too, love Panera's soup, but this was not very similar.  It took about 3 hours to make and it wasn't exceptional.  Worth it, if you've got time to kill.

This was really great. Even my husband loved it and he doesn't care for peppers. ( I didn't tell him ;) I skipped the cayenne so it wouldn't be spicy.  Next time I will definately use canned tomatoes though.  Its very time consuming peeling the tomatoes yourself.

This soup was just what I've been looking for. I love Panera Bread's new Red Pepper - Tomato Bisque and this reminds me of it.  I used vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth since I'm a vegetarian but otherwise, stuck to the recipe. The thyme flavor was very strong so next time I'll try basil and maybe a bay leaf instead.  Thanks for a great one!

This tastes great.  I doubles the cayenne.  I also skipped the sour cream, but next time I may try some low-fat yogurt.  I froze a batch.  Highly recommended.

The soup was ok. I was disappointed that the roasted red pepper flavour wasn't strong and hearty. I suggest using additional roasted peppers if you'd like a stronger flavor.

I served this delightful soup at a wine tasting dinner party.  In order to shorten the cooking time, I cooked the peppers in olive oil instead of roasting.  I also used water in place of chicken broth to meet the needs of a vegetarian and replaced one half the water with heavy whipping cream.  What a delightful treat.  It was loved by all at the dinner party.

I absolutely love this soup! I did use only 2 red peppers instead of the 3 called for in the recipe, and it was super. The addition of the peppers spices up the tomato soup and makes it really flavorful.

Soup was excellent but I very much disagree with the prep time given - 15 min maybe if you were a speed demon, this recipe takes much longer than 15 min prep time....the soup is worth the work but beware.

I've been looking for a good tomato soup recipie and this one was tasty.  Worth the extra effort of roasting the peppers and running it through the blender.  The peppers gave it a nice twist.  This would be an impressive soup for company.  Kids didn't go for it however.

Love this soup.  I made the same changes as some others for the sake of convenience; used a can of crushed tomatoes, jar of red peppers and added cornstarch instead of the roux.  I also froze it into individual baggies which I laid flat in the freezer.  Looking forward to my lunch for a while.

I mixed it up a bit and roasted 5 peppers,  added 1 can of seasoned tomatoes as well as 2 fresh chopped tomatoes, chilli flakes and 3 instead of 2 garlic cloves.   I added one can of coconut milk at the end and it was amazing.  I'll be making this again.

I pretty much followed the recipe but I roasted all the veggies including the tomoatoes and onion (and garlic for a short time) and blended everything together at the end instead of separating it.  I added some homemade  tomato paste and a little butter when blending it. It tasted like  a restaurant tomato soup, I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was a huge hit! I made it using peppers and tomatoes from my garden. I also used some “sweet with heat” peppers from my garden and omitted the hot sauce and cayenne pepper. Wonderful!

I liked this a lot. I wish I could have given it 4.5 stars because I ranked it a 4 since I was going for more of the red pepper taste; hubby thought it was the best he'd ever had. 

I followed the recipe as it was, using about 2/3 regular tomatoes and the rest Roma. For the hot sauce, I used a dash of Sriracha.

Be forewarned: this is a tad labor-intensive. Next time, I'll make a double or triple batch and try freezing it.

I use tomatoes and peppers out of my own vegetable garden, and it makes this soup truly amazing in flavor!  I make a double recipe, and freeze it and eat it throughout the winter.  It's a bit of work to roast and peel the veggies, but very worth it.

To be fair, I didn't follow the recipe as is.  I had to use canned tomato and store bought roasted red peppers.  Fresh produce available didn't look great.  I also used vegetable broth and reduced the amount to 4 cups.  It was good. But needed additional seasoning to make it great.  I added smoked paprika, onion & garlic powder.  All in all a good base.

Easy to make - used two small hot red bell peppers roasted instead of the hot sauce and cayenne.

This is sooooo good.  Used only 1 red pepper and 10 Roma tomatoes.  Roasted those sprinkled with olive oil and sliced on a baking sheet and never did peel them -- the puree process took care of that.  Didn't add sugar, flour, or hot sauce.  Put all the other spices in with the sauté of onion and garlic (which is where I used the butter) then added (home made) chicken stock and roasted tomatoes and pepper.  Simmered then pureed as directed.  The taste of this is wonderful!

Made as described, (except for straining and blending, I just used my submersion blender). omitted the hot sauce. 
Very pure flavours, but I wasn't really impressed. I guess it's a matter of taste :-)

I like to make the recipe as is and then see if changes should be made.  Having made it for a group of 8 ladies, who all enjoyed it,  I don't think there's any need to make changes.  It was delicious as is.    I will say, however, that whoever said it took 15 minutes for prep must have had 5 other people in the kitchen helping .

This recipe has a bland to no flavor.  Everyone who gave it a 4 Star or more changed it up.  I wish I would have read the reviews before making the dish.  I made cornbread with it to compensate for taste.  It was quite a bit of work and took to long.  Thanks anyway!

I followed the directions for roasting the whole bell peppers but also roasted baby carrots (olive oil, salt/pepper & rosemary) with them. I added the seasonings as I cooked the onion/garlic. Instead of cooking all veggies together, I blended 2 cans of diced tomatoes (fresh per the directions would probably be good too but I had these on hand), roasted peppers/carrots and onion + fresh basil & spinach. I skipped the broth and flour/butter step. I’m not a fan of sour cream so I skipped that too. I would definitely make this again.

Yummy soup for a Fall Dinner! VERY LABOR INTENSIVE - plan to allow enough time. No mention of specific tomatoes so I used large Beefsteak and they were a bear to peel! Next time I will try Roma which tend to be easier to peel. No need to oil peppers prior to roasting (be sure to line pan with foil so they don't stick). I never measure so I just dumped ingredients into pot (more than recommended except sugar), including LOTS of fresh garlic (we LOVE garlic) and the flavors were AMAZING! 15 minute prep time is significantly under estimated.  Recommend doubling recipe so you can freeze it since its only a little more work. Served with beer-soaked grilled cheese - extra yummy!

Not pleased. WAAAAAAY too much thyme. I had a feeling it would be, should have listened to my gut. Next time I will cut the thyme to no more than 1/2 teaspoon and then maybe I will be able to taste the other flavours.

I didn't like this very well. Maybe it was because I didn't thin it with chicken stock. I thought it was ok, but I wouldn't make it again.

I changed it a little, I didn't add the flour nor the butter, it was thick enough. We liked it, I'll make it again for sure.

Wonderful soup! I made this with three red peppers, none reserved, and I also roasted the tomatoes. We like it spicy, so I added a touch more than a pinch of cayenne. Also, this is a great soup to freeze, just be sure to freeze before adding any dairy!!  And, lastly, I thickened with potato starch (1 T plus 2 T cold water)...soooo yummmmmm

I made exactly as instructed. Took the tomatoes to render their juices much longer than 25 minutes however moderate heat? I chose medium low, hence the wait time. That being said? OMG. Delish!  Peeling tomatoes? Normally I would blanch but did not call for that. A bit painful but the amount of heat & spices? Perfect! Having a dinner party in two months and the soup was on my list. Just make the day before. Gonna be a hit!

I cheated a little and used canned diced tomatoes and jarred roasted red pepper. It came together quickly and had good flavor.  I will definitely make it again.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  Has a bit of a kick to it, so if you're leary of a kick, ease up on the cayenne - my cayenne also came out a little quickly when I "dashed" it, so that may be partly my problem.  I'm not sure how necessary it is to separate the broth from the tomatoes/peppers to do the puree especially if you have a high powered blender, so I would probably skip that step next time and just puree things in batches.  Next time, I'm going to try and use a more paleo friendly thickener than flour.  Next time I will also do an additional pepper (suggested in other reviews).  

All in all, I will make again - a perfect soup for a cold winter day.  :)

I think this is a good soup recipe and here is what NOT to do.  I needed to use up some harvested cherry sized heirloom tomatoes and after roasting them with some beefsteak heirlooms , red and yellow bell peppers, red onions and garlic, I took the stick blender to them (having read that would work on seed and skins)  and spend a loooong time straining out the skins and seeds which removed most of the bitterness. I didn't use an equal amount of roasted peppers so that flavor is not enough to shine through.  I like the variation of using thyme, cayenne and paprika. I will try to stick to the recipe next time , but wanted to share my new wisdom.

I put dried basil in mine & it added a really nice layer of flavor. I used cayenne & chipotle to spice it - perfect level of heat! I'm only giving it 4 stars because I feel the tomatoes overwhelm the pepper flavor.

The recipe produces a flavourful result.  However, it was very labour-intensive.   It kept me on the move for all of the nearly two hours it took to prepare.  I'll be looking for shortcuts if I make it again:)

I really liked this. I only used about 5 cups chicken stock. I also used 1 yellow, 1 orange and 1 red pepper because that is what I already had. I also used canned petite diced tomatoes. I left everything in the pot and used my immersion blender. Flavor was great--tasted just like the recipe name roasted pepper and tomato soup. Great with a grilled cheese sandwich.

So I made this exactly as the recipe said at first my 5 year old tried it and first said he didn't like it. It tasted funny lol he is used to tomato basil soup. My husband said it tasted odd. I agree with both of them it's DEFININTLY NOT a soup I can just eat with some bread but I HATE TO WASTE anything this time consuming so after we attempted to have it for dinner I thought about the flavors. My husband and I felt tex mex which got me thinking CHILI. So the next morning I threw cooked hamburger, kidney beans, onions, tomatoes and chili seasoning in the crockpot and it made THE BEST chili my family had ever had super flavorful then add some cheese, fritos or cornbread we fell in love with it!!

Lovely recipe, my husband is usually not a fan of tomato soup, but loved this recipe. I added some tomato paste at the end to add colour, the rest is exactly.

I might've given more stars if I'd followed the exact recipe & it had come out great.  However, after the suggested 15 minutes of prep time had long passed me by (you've gotta be a master chef to do all that prepping in 15 minutes), I ended up taking some tips from other comments about cutting out a few steps.  My end product is ok.  Definitely needs more red peppers if you want that flavour to come through.  Next time, I'll remember to add the word 'easy' to my search for roasted red pepper & tomato soup.

This is a tasty soup!  There is a great deal of work involved and the soup does not have a very strong roasted red pepper flavor.  I will likely not make this again based on that.

Really yummy! I roasted my own red peppers, but since I didn't have any garden tomatoes, I used canned. I followed the advice of others and added an extra red pepper. I also skipped the back and forth with liquids and simply used my Cuisinart smart stick and pureed it all, right in the pot. For garnish I added a dollop of Greek yogurt and a sprig of cilantro. I'll make this one again!

2nd time making this. Only changes...I roasted peppers AND tomatoes, cooled, pulled skins off, and seeded peppers. Kept peeled tomatoes whole.Threw all into pot,  as is, no need to chop, as they're going to be pureed anyway. Cooked down as written. Added 2 of the 6 Cups Of broth, pureed with immersion blender. Added rest of broth, (chix, veg, turkey, any will be awesome...I used half  chix, half veg) then proceeded as written. Added about 12 oz half and half at end for depth, but we love bisque like soups, you may not! Thanks for an awesome Recipe! My family and paddle team thank you!

Just finished making it. Followed the recipe except blended stuff before adding the broth to it. Gave my husband a taste just after finishing it and he said "its not good". So all that for nothing:( It was a really labor intensive soup and I don't think the flavor is bad, but I also don't love it. Probably won't make this again.

Good soup but labor intensive.  I won't make this often but when I really want to cook, then I will make this.  Next time I will roast the tomatoes to see if there is any difference.  Maybe I will even consider the short cuts (canned items), just to compare.

Soup was fantastic!!! I wanted this soup to be dairy/meat free so instead of using the butter and flour at the end to thicken I used some tomato paste at the same time as putting the stock in (used veg instead of chicken as well) and it turned out great. Used an emersion blender also instead of straining which was much easier.
Even better the second day also after it's had a chance to mingle in the fridge overnight.

Delicious and creamy, even without the sour cream. The ONLY change I made was to decrease the amount of  broth for a thicker soup. Perfect for a light dinner or even with a 1/2 sandwich. Thank you!

OMG!  Eating this right now.  Used 3C veggie broth and 1C chix; did not add as much broth back to the pureed toms/pepps to avoid a thickening agent.  What a lovely soup!!

Meh soup. Roasted red pepper and spicing was good but the tomato overwhelmed everything and was too watery. Probably if I had better tomatos and cooked it longer during the second step to really, really cook off all the tomato juices it could have been better. I cut back on the chicken stock to 4 cups and I still would if I had to do it again. Definitely a labor and time intensive recipe.

Great recipe! I made some soft garlic twisty bread to go with this soup. I chunked up the bread and added to each bowl before serving. I topped with a sprinkle of parmesan and it was fantastic! Reminds me of Boston Pizza's version! Yum yum!

I found it quite good - tho' I didn't follow directions exactly - and tweaked with extra herbs/spices like I always.  Instead of making a roux tho'  - I just put in 1/4 cup of Italian bread crumbs - and it thickened up nicely - that was done on the last simmer phase.

Oh MAN was this worth every step!  YUM-O!  I love peppers, especially red peppers and I am supposed to get more of them in my diet.  I suppose better anti-oxidants eaten raw, but this is a fabulous way to use the delectable red pepper! Perfect on a stormy day like today.

Very close to the restaurant soup I was trying to recreate.  I modified the soup to be vegan, sugar and oil free and it was still very satisfying.  Fresh peppers at store looked awful, so I used two 12 ounce jars of roasted red peppers.  Used one 14 ounce can of fire roasted tomatoes.  Sauteed onions and garlic in water and used about 5 cups of vegetable broth.  Didn't use any sugar and used more cayenne pepper and hot sauce than in the recipe.  Also didn't reserve any peppers for the end and skipped the butter, flour and sour cream and the soup was fabulous.  Lots of flavor and very satisfying.  I'm sure the recipe as is is good, but I saved a lot of time using canned goods and it was yummy!!! And vegan.  : )

really good!  I didn't have cayenne pepper so I added some red pepper flakes.  It gave the soup a really good kick, especially if you like spicy foods.  I roasted my own peppers too, and it was definitely worth it!

I used jarred roasted red peppers from Trader Joes.  I also saw a jar of a curios pickled red pepper, so I threw those in too.  This recipe takes a bit more time, from straining and liquifying and putting it all back together, but the result is exceptional.  One of the best soups I've ever had.

This soup was wonderful.  The only change I made was to double everything but the tomatoes and chicken broth because I wanted to be sure the pepper flavor dominated.  I also did use diced canned tomatoes. It was good with  the sour cream, and we also substituted goat cheese which was nice.  A lot of work, but I plan to make it whenever red peppers are on sale and I've got the time!

This soup was great - I loved the flavor! I especially liked the little bit of a kick that the hot sauce and cayenne pepper gave the soup.  I made it exactly the way the recipe said.  I will definitely make this again!

This soup is wonderful.  I swapped out the chicken stock for veggie broth, added an extra pepper as one reviewer suggested, and only used 3 tomatoes (because that's all I had on hand).  I also skipped the hot sauce and added more cayenne (personal preference).  I really like the combination of flavours, have eaten it with salmon and grilled cheese and it's just fantastic... the only reason it's not 5 stars is because it takes so freakin' long to make!!  If I could find a way to cut down the prep time by about an hour, I'd make this all the time.

Best Soup Ever!!  I have made this several times, since I enjoy a creamy soup with no chunks, I just throw everything in the blender when it's done cooking and then add it to the already thickened chicken stock.

I agree with others that if you're looking for roasted red pepper taste, you should add more roasted red peppers.  Also, if you're  sensitive to spice like I am, I would be cautious with how much cayenne you add.

This was a good soup. However I do think that it lacked a depth of flavor, and did not know how to remedy that even with a few extra additions.

This recipe was wonderful.  It was a little time consuming but was completely worth it.  It was thick and flavorful, and the recipe made enough to freeze some for another meal.  I used a little less thyme than the recipe called for, simply because I am not overly fond of thyme, and used smoked paprika.  My husband raved over this.  Definitely a winner.

I modified the recipe to fit my needs.  Made it a little easier.  Sauteed onion, peppers (not roasted) and cherry tomatoes together.  Added tomato puree, veggie base, cooked and then pureed the pulp all together.  Very good.

This soup is delicious, but not necessarily worth the work.  I used at least six big pots, pan, blenders, and cookie sheets to make this,.  It takes around two hours to make from start to finish, and that's not wait time, you are working on it almost the entire time.  The taste is good, but not necessarily worth it for a weeknight dinner, and a busy household.  It is better then canned, but I'm going to search for a soup that's easier to make.

Loved the soup.  Took some other member suggestions and used canned diced tomatoes instead (way too much work to peel, deseed) and added 4th pepper.  Pureed them all, no reserving one chopped pepper.  I think it's better than Trader Joe's version.

I honestly didn't think this soup would be all that great.  I'm not a HUGE fan of red peppers and it just sounded like way too much for me.  But oh boy was I wrong.  This one is a keeper.  A little time consuming, but totally worth it and beautiful for a romantic dinner, valentines day, anniversay, etc.  Great with Salmon.

The soup is fantastic. And if I'd been a better cook it might even have tasted like it was supposed to have done.  However, (this is entirely my own fault -- I'm a new cook and still learning) it came out way hotter than I expected.  And I'm Indian so thats saying a lot.  Anyway, I wanted to make it with only one red bell pepper so I halved all the ingredients.  However instead of two I used one really large (size of a small squash) red vine ripened tomato.  I also had no paprika so I substituted red chilly flakes.  That might have been my first mistake.  I also had no thyme so ditched that.  And when it said to add a pinch of cayenne pepper (another thing I didn't have) I added a 1/4 tsp of red chilly powder. Mistake number two I fear.  What should I have done instead?  Any tips?

*update - you can use green peppers and it tastes the same - just not as pretty, but way less to make since red peppers are twice as much!  I only used 1 red pepper and half a green pepper for color, and this still turned out great. I also did not skin them, or blend up the cooked veggies, just made sure they were good and shredded/tiny. I like some texture to my soup. I also used diced tomatoes instead of fresh ones. A heaping blob of sour cream is a MUST with this recipe and goes awesome with grilled mozzarella cheese sandwiches.

YUM. It took a rather long time to make but it was worth the effort. It was so good, I forgot to put in the sour cream! The soup vanished in no time.

I was really looking forward to this recipe.  And while it was definitely better than something out of the can, it did not meet my expectations.  The hue and texture were both very nice, but I was hoping for something creamier.  This just didn't hit the spot for me.  It tasted more like a good marinara or pizza sauce than a tomato soup that warms you up on a cold night.  I have to admit that I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh ones which probably made some difference.  And I didn't have any cayenne on hand, so I used a pinch of Chili powder instead.  Nevertheless, I don't think either of those things changed it so much that is caused my disappointment, and I followed the rest of recipe as written.  Being that this soup takes so long to make, I doubt that I will make it again often if at all.  Maybe some cream added to it would give it what I'm looking for.  I may have to try it again some time with some modifications.

This soup looks wonderful, and I think it would make a really tasty pasta sauce. Hard to explain, but I almost found it too flavourful as a soup. Definitely worth trying though, because it's a unique taste.

Easy and good. I used canned tomatoes because it was winter, and that meant less cooking time. I was careful not to over blend so the soup had a nice texture. Instead of a flour roux I used cornstarch in a bit of cold water to save the calories of the butter.

This was awesome.  Except I probably added more tomato and red pepper than called for and I only did 5 cups of broth.  Did a final cup of heavy cream at the very end after the puree process and before the roux.  DELISH!

This was so delicious!  I did everything exactly the way it said, with just these two exceptions: I used less broth (1 can) and more cayenne and salt (to taste).  Other than that, it was to the T and I served it stuffed jalapenos and homemade cornbread.  My husband, who is a very picky eater, thought it was one of the best meals I've ever made.  Other reviews said it was too labor intensive, but for someone who loves to cook, it was a lot of fun!  I'll be making this again and again.

Very tasty, and if you use canned tomatoes and jarred roasted red pepper, it is quit quick and simple.  Perfect with a nice grilled cheese sandwich.

I really loved this soup and the leftovers are even better. I did use an extra pepper as others suggested and did not reserve any of it for the end.  I also used more than four tomatoes as mine were small...probably about 8 small tomatoes.  The flavor was wonderful but it did taste a bit like marinara sauce at times.  The prep is tedious so save this recipe for a time when you plan on all day cooking. I made grilled cheese sandwiches with thick fresh bread and cheddar cheese....so good!

So good! Can't eat wheat, so added a little bit of corn starch to thicken it up.  Also added a bit of tomato paste for flavour as we used 8 peppers.  Took a long time to make to worth it!!

This was truly a delicious soup.  I embarked upon making this without reviewing how much time it takes!  As others have stated, it is very labor intensive but worth it.  I found it to have plenty of flavor.  Served with a batch of grilled cheddar cheese sandwiches baked in the oven.  Would also be delicious with some big, homemade garlic croutons.

Perhaps this recipe was a little out of my league.  The soup was tasty, but mine came out a little thin. Next time I'll cook off more of the tomato juices and see how it goes.

This recipe turned out so delicious!
The only changes I made were to use much less sour cream.  I used about two tablespoons and I would say the soup was great even before then!
I also had some after it was made and reheated a day later and found that like most tomato soups and sauces it improves in quality if it is allowed to mature overnight in a refrigerator.

Sounds delicious but given the labor involved, wasn't worth effort. Flavor was good but there are other soups out there with more flavor where it doesn't take 1hr 40min and use up most of the stuff in the kitchen. Don't think I'll do again.

I know everyone has rated this a 5 star already, but its excellent. I found I needed to add a good amount of salt to taste it, and I went ahead and added basil, and the sour cream right to the pot instead of individual bowls. I also blended it all together (instead of straining); don't think it makes much of a difference. REALLY good.

Loved the recipe- did not take the 1 hr 40 min to make.  I rushed the simmering steps and completed the process in about 30 min.  I also substituted canned tomatoes, but used fresh roasted red peppers, I also added brown sugar and extra red pepper- it had a great kick!

Chose this because of all the fresh tomatoes and peppers available right now.  This is a winner!  I did use 2 red, 1 yellow and 1 orange bell because that's what I had.  Followed the rest exactly.  Hubby loves it too!

I didn't make any changes to this recipe. Asides from a small accident with a blender (an explosion really) everything went well. The soup tasted great but was missing something to put it over the top. I would reccomend this recipe to any lover of tomato soup.

YUMMMM!  This is such a great recipe.  I took the advice of others and used canned tomatos (thank goodness) because I knew the red peppers would take awhile.  Everything came out with such a great flavor and consistency.  I can't wait to mess around with the recipe and add my own pizazz to it!  FANTASTIC!!

Yum! This is far beyond "tomato soup" as other posters have been calling it. The red pepper flavour really comes through. I followed the original recipe with only a few changes. I roasted 4.5 peppers and only used 3.5 tomatoes. Also roasted a whole head of garlic and tossed that into the soup with the peppers. Blended everything with an immersion blender. I highly recommend extra peppers in this dish because otherwise it might be just plain old tomato soup. The cayenne gives it a nice kick. We ate this gorgeous soup with hot cornbread and butter. Will definitely make this again.

This soup took me a lot longer than 15 minutes in prep time. Actually, I felt like it took me the whole afternoon for an ok result. As a college student, it wasn't worth the time and the money. I'll find a quicker alternative next time.

This was sooo good! I loved how the soup had that tang of spiciness! I added some crushed red pepper flakes, and some sweet red peppers to this dish, along with the bell peppers. I also added some cooked noddles and red kidney beans. Is definatly a fav in my house!

This was a great tomato soup! I love the flavor that the roasted peppers add.  I've tried other recipes like this, and this one  a little easier.  My boyfriend keeps telling me how great it was and I made it 2 months ago!

After reading the reviews, I added more spices to this - basil, oregano, Old Bay, parsley, and some
Mrs. Dash original per taste. Also, 1/8 cup of potato flakes and 1/2 cup soy milk. I boiled 6 medium
size tomatoes and then peeled them and pureed
in the food processer which measured almost 4
cups.  I used 4 cups of water with chicken bouillion granules.  I only had one red pepper
which I chopped and sauteed in oil with the onion.
Very good.

At first I thought it was a little bland, but soon realized I had forgotten my  "salt to taste" which is very important- I added about a tablespoon. I also added a tablespoon of tomato paste, left out the roux (which I didnt think you needed) and added a 1/4 cup of milk. With the sour cream, and a little manchego cheese on top, it was FANTASTIC.  I will definately make it again, just maybe on  the weekend when I have more time.

Delicious! I substituted vegetable broth and it was fine. I added the butter/flour roux at the end--but I dont think the soup really needed it, if you are looking to save a few calories. I will have this on my menu any time the red bell peppers are on sale! Even my pickiest friends loved it.

This soup was everything I expected. Since I had made a similar soup, roasted red pepper and pear soup, which added a pasilla pepper (roasted and chopped) I added that to this soup as well, and it added just the right amount of kick. My kids even liked it, which is truly amazing!

I made this soup for 20 people for 2 Thanksgiving dinners last year. It was a super hit. All my guests asked for the recipe. I made some modifications. Instead of flour I used red potatoes skin and all, to thicken it. I did not use chicken broth because most of my guests were vegetarian. Instead I used water 1/2 the amount the recipe calls for. Ofcourse my hot pepper sauce was garam masala (used in most Indian cooking). I garnished with finely chopped fresh basil. No sour cream. Yum!!! I make it all the time for my family. This is our favorite soup.

I think tomato soup is kind of gross and unpleaseant tasting. This recipe however is hearty almost meaty tasting. The roasted pepers almost gives ita pizza flavor. It is the most awesome tomato soup you will ever try. It has a rich consistency and flavor that you will think this comes from a fine dining restaraunt.

I used what I thought was the equivalent amount of jarred roasted red pepper but I guess I didn't use enough because I couldn't taste it.  But as a tomato soup, this is still a good recipe.  I left out the butter and just mixed a little bit of soup into the flour and then added it back to the soup.
