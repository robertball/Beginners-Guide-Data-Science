I loved this! I do agree with the first reviewer that grilled veggies are a stand out on their own....but I disagree in a 2 star rating....I thought this was really very good. I used leftover Simple Grilled Vegetables from this site...asparagus. zucchini, yellow squash, tomatoes, and mushrooms. This dish was perfect for leftovers. I roughly chopped the veggies and then made the quick dressing and tossed and chilled until dinner. I did decrease the dressing to 1 tblspn of olive oil, 2 tblspns red wine vinegar, 1 tablspn of dijon, the garlic, salt and cracked pepper. Great flavors and I would definately make again. Thanks!

Grilled veggies are the best. Rather than make a salad - I serve the dressing as a dip. 8 tablespoons of oil for 6 servings seems excessive so I also cut down on the oil. I like to serve with crumbled gorgonzola. Also grill some corn, pineapple, tomatoes, green onions, eggplantr, ... and make this a dinner.

This wasn't terrible, but we didn't really enjoy it.  The tastes of grilled veggies are so wonderful on their own, the vinaigrette really masked and overwhelmed their flavors.

I enjoyed this recipe, I kept to the dressing as written, and it was excellent. Since this dish can be served at room temperature, I took whole wheat rotini and added it to bowl with the bite size pieces of vegetables to make a pasta salad type thing. I'll make it again for sure!!

I think you can use this as a dressing or a dip, that is how good it is!  I served this at a barbeque with some very picky eaters and it was a huge hit.  I even subsituted Dijon mustard with regular mustard because that was all I had and everyone love it!  If you can appeal to the masses, you have a hit on your hands!

The veggies are wonderful on their own.  I served them without the dressing and with balsamic vinegar as a dipping sauce.  They were a huge hit!  I think next time, I will half some cherry tomatoes and grill them along with a few julienne strips of jalapenos.  Salt is completely unnecessary to me.

I loved this recipe and have made it several times. Yes, grilled vegetables stand on their own and don't need a dressing, but if you are grilling for a crowd, sometimes there isn't room on the grill for everything. You can make this dish ahead of time, and then save the grill for the meat. I think the salad is even better the next day, after the vegetables have soaked up some of the dressing. I've also added fusilli pasta to it, and served it on a bed of arugula.

Absolutely delicious and simple! Didn't need anything else for dinner, it was so filling.

I grilled up some corn in their husks and cut off the kernels into the salad to add a bit of crunch and sweetness. I also used different colored peppers out of personal preference.

Don't even dare use all that dressing. I spooned a bit on the veggies toward the end of their cooking and then just a couple tablespoons tossed in for a slight acidic accent. Added a little salt and lots of ground black pepper to my personal helping.

YUM

I took this to a pot luck picnic.  Fixed it as is, and as soon as it was done walked out the door to the picnic.    It was great because it was a different side dish from the usual baked beans, pasta, and potato salads.  I will make again since everyone enjoyed it and it is so easy to make.

I followed this recipe exactly as written except I left out the asparagus and I diced the veggies up then added banza noodles which are noodles that are made out of chickpeas, and I made a cold noodle salad. Even my pickiest eater who hates anything with onions loved it. Her only complaint was I put too many onions in it. Next time I may add some cherry tomatoes.

It's a simple, solid recipe.  The amount vinaigrette does seem out of line with the quantity of vegetables.  I'll make this again but will reduce the  vinaigrette ingredients by a 1/3 to a 1/2.

Made this multiple times with whatever veggies I have in surplus - always squash, zucchini and onions. Family really enjoys it, which means it's a great, healthy way to use up all of my veggies. If there are leftovers, dressing can get a bit too much, so I usually keep it separate for everyone to add what they want.

Excellent summer side. We used eggplant in place of the yellow squash because we couldn't find squash. Worked great. I used less of the dressing but it was delish- light and fresh.

I used zucchini, asparagus, red onion, mushrooms, and red/yellow/orange/green  bell peppers. I cut the veggies into strips instead of cubes. I grilled them on a stovetop grill seasoned with smoked salt.  Perfect! I also added some celery seed and black pepper to the dressing! This dish is one of the best things we've ever eaten.

The review is for the vinaigrette!  So glad I didn't pour it on the delicious grilled vegies!  It was much to vinegary for my taste.  Always love grilled vegetables though.
