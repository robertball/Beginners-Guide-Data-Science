I enjoyed this, but I like unusual/exotic dishes. However, the group of ladies I served it to didn't seem to enjoy it, nor did they ask for the recipe (which they always do when they like a dish served at our ladies luncheons.) If you like out-of-the-ordinary fare, you'll probably enjoy this.  The cilantro (must use fresh, not dried) really makes this dish!! It needed more salt, and I doubled the amount of peas and almonds.

Excellent salad!  I left out the honey because I prefer the tanginess of the dressing without it.  The only change I'll make next time would be to double the spices for a little more flavor.

Good stuff!  I made this for a family party ... that I later had to skip ... so I was left with a double recipe's worth.  I am eating it this week for lunch at the office.  I am gussying it up for the sake of variety...with (at this point) either horseradish or garlic paste (available at the Indian gorcery; looks a lot like horseradish).  My one comment on the original recipe: I'm not sure if the bacon added anything at all, except keeping it out of vegetarian hands!

This was great.  I didn't understand a couple of the reviews that said it was dry.  This is very creamy.  I had some brown rice left over from another recipe so I had to scale the recipe back to match the amount of rice I had.  I left out the almonds but I added chopped waterchestnuts and that gave it a great crunch.  I also used turkey bacon to cut back fat a little more.  So simple to make.

I Thought this recipe was great!  My family does not eat pork so I switched the bacon for a can of chickpeas and it was fantastic!  You could also swap the sour cream for 'soy cream' substitute and make the dish vegan friendly!  we also tried it with wild rice mixed in and it added an extra nutty crunch!  we will surely make it again!  thank you!

Not nearly as much flavor as I thought it would have.  Still good, just different than I expected.

Yum. Few minor changes due to what was in the kitchen: fat free sour cream instead of low fat, canadian bacon instead of traditional and pine nuts in stead of almonds. I also used red pepper flakes instead of a res bell pepper. I had some leftover english cucumber from another salad recipe so I tiossed that in as well. Would be good with some tomatoes in this as well. as well as some broccoli slaw

A delicious recipe!  I doubled the spices and left out the cilantro, as my family doesn't care for it.  
And, as another cook suggested, I also omitted the bacon & added chick peas. 
Very tasty & healthy - LOVE the cumin!

I really liked the flavors of this creamy and satisfying salad.  I left out the cilantro cause I really dont care for it and it was great.  A great way to get in your fiber.  I used minute brown rice also cause its easier.  Wonderful!  Thanks.

Ick.  Sorry, but a very odd concoction. No one here cared for it at all.

Wow, I thought this salad looked like it would be good, but I was surprised at how good it really was!  I will definately make it again.  This makes a healthy, satisfying lunch.

This was just okay. The blend of flavors gave it a funny smell as well as a very different after taste. I don't think I will be making this again.

Great salad on serving day, better the 2nd day!  I subbed yogurt for the sour cream, used additional almonds in place of the bacon and used extra lime juice in place of the vinegar.  I'll be making this again!

But don't include the almonds because then it tastes like some of the rice didn't finish cooking.

Tried this for lunch to take to work.  This is OK but it seemed pretty dry and a little bland after letting sit overnight in the fridge.  Maybe if I doubled the spices and red wine vinegar and added another 1/2 cup of sour cream it would be the consistency I was looking for?  I'll continue to eat this until it's gone but I'm not sure if we'll make again.

I liked this very much. Thought it had very good flavor.
