My husband made a face when I told him what we were having for dinner but guess what? He really liked this recipe as did I. We are both pepperoni lovers. Only thing I would do differently next time is use bow-tie pasta.

This is my recipe and I have made it forever. However I have made changes over the years. I cook the spaghetti first and now I use whole wheat thin. Then while that's draining in the same pan I cook up two peppers (any color) and one onion and any amount of pepperoni. Add the spaghetti back in and then I add one of those containers of real parmesan cheese stir and serve.

Didn't even miss the sauce in this spaghetti! I used chicken sausage because that's what i had on hand but I know this would be fab with pepperoni.

I liked this recipe. It was easy to make and called for ingredients I already had on hand. Though I didn't have much bell pepper I added some asparagus and two dashes of crushed red pepper for some zing. I also didn't find it neccessary to bake as the cheese melted to a nice texture when added to the hot pasta.

I was apprehensive that my fiance would like this recipe but we both loved it. I only used one green pepper but I added mushrooms and grape tomatoes. Like someone else had sad I also added a little crushed red pepper for a little extra spice. I also used bow tie pasta instead of spaghetti. It turned out great.

I remade this dish using Johnsonville Sausage in place of the pepperoni. I also omitted the green pepper since my family does not care for it. I used only one 8 ounce package of angel hair pasta as the recipe yield states it makes 8 servings but using 2 boxes of pasta would yield 16 servings. Using just one box gave plenty of pasta. This turned out pretty well and works great for a quick meal when you only have a little bit of time to throw something together. The kids ate it and didn't complain so that's a win.

It was good but extremely dry.... definitely needs a sauce!
