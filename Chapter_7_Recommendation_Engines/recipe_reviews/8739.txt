I changed things slightly to fit my family's tastes.  I added a bit more mexican kick by tossing the cubed chicken in taco seasoning before cooking.  I used brown rice to make it a bit healthier and I only used a sprinkling of cheese instead of the recommended amount.  Then I served it up with a dolop of fat free sour cream and home made guacamole.  It was fantastic.  The leftovers will be great to use as a burrito filling.  My husband is a diabetic and this recipe is chock full of flavor, protein and, since I used brown rice, has healthy carbohydrates for him to enjoy.

Um...can you say DELICIOUS!!?? This is such a fantastic recipe! The version I make takes a bit longer because I don't use instant rice:
If I have it, I like to use 6-8 bone-in skinless chicken pieces...season them and brown them in olive oil. While they're browning I also throw some sliced yellow onions in the pan and get them all nice a browned as well. Then I add the chicken broth and salsa (I always use the fresh stuff from the deli section of the grocery store packed with cilantro!!), also add 1 cup uncooked brown rice and 1 cup water..and as a nice nutritional bonus, a can of black beans. Turn to low, cover and simmer until the rice is cooked, about an hour, adding water if necessary. Cilantro is a yummy garnish. Also, if you use the small cubed chicken as in the recipe or just pick some chicken off the bone in my version..this makes amazing taco/burrito filling!

I made Salsa Chicken in the crockpot today (homemade salsa, chicken breasts, homemade taco seasoning--cook on low all day) in order to make this dish. I just folded in the chopped Salsa Chicken into the rice after it had cooked. I also adjusted the dish in order to use regular long-grain rice instead of instant, which I never keep on hand. Other than that, I kept everything the same. I did not care for this, but my husband and kids did--they ate every single bite. I served this with additional salsa and reduced fat sour cream and I made a black bean/corn "salad" to go with--the combination together was very nice.

Love Love Loved this recipe!  Will make again and again. Next time will add a bag of frozen mexican veggies (black beans,corn,onion, peppers) and maybe use brown rice to make it healthier.  The only change I made was to add taco seasoning to the chicken while it was cooking, i think it added lots of flavor

This has good flavor, but I wonder if the 2 cups of instant rice isn't too much.  I included 16 ounces of salsa instead of only 8, and added 1/2 cup sour cream and 2 tablespoons green chilies before the rice.  I served it with taco sauce and tortilla chips.  You can also throw in a cup of corn, or serve with corn bread.

Simple, quick, and delicious! Everything in one pan for easy clean-up which was a plus. I needed something easy for a late night supper for me and my husband and this was perfect. I did season the chicken with "Taco Seasoning II" from this site before browning. And I used Ortega's Thick and Chuncky salsa - a bit more than called for actually. This was done in no time at all! I used a Mexican blend cheese and to make the presentation a little better I chopped some green onion and sliced black olives on top and served with a side of light sour cream. This has to be one of the easiest meals I've ever made off of this site!

This was great. I was not sure if two cups of rice meant cooked or uncooked so I only put one bag of uncooked rice in and it needed more so I put two. Hopefully that will help anyone else that may be wondering. It is definitely worth tryig.

Excellent!  Used brown rice and sprinkled the chicken with some taco seasoning while it was cooking. Added some corn and topped it off with some sour cream, very good! Thank you!

My FAVORITE! I have made this recipe about 5 or 6 times already and love it!  It is super simple and delicious. I never have instant rice on hand, so I just use regular rice. I also add a dab or two of sour cream before serving and I add less cheese than the recipe calls for. Other than that, it is perfect!!!

I used 4 chic breasts(they were big) and tossed them into taco seasoning as someone suggested. I also added more salsa. I think you could add anything to give it more flavor or your secret ingredient. Great thing to put in a burrito as someone suggested.

This was ok, but I like it better to use regular rice. Instant didnt aborb the flavors very well. The flavor was so much better and more authentic when I tried a second time. I used 1 c regular long grain rice. I added it to the cooked chicken before adding the broth and salsa. I covered and brought the whole thing to a slow boil for about 20 minutes. Next time I will throw some onion and bell pepper in with the chicken too. Thanks for an easy arroz con pollo idea :)

So Yummy! Relatively quick to make.  The longest part of it is frying the chicken.  It tastes great, but even I like a little less cheese.  The flavor is great and I love it.  I make it once a week I like it so much!  Thank you to whoever submitted this one!

This couldn't be any quicker to make. Added paprika & cumin as others did to the browning chicken (used Tyson diced frozen chicken -- so easy!) Followed remainder of recipe as is and found it a little bland. Could be due to the mild salsa I used. So I added 2 tsp diced jalapeno, 1 tbsp Cilantro and 10 drops Tobasco. Now we're talkin'. Decided I would throw in a can of diced tomatoes in the juice and a can of rinsed corn as others did. It is now delicious and with just enough of a kick -- not too spicy. Going to serve corn bread on the side.

Easy; delicious; doesn't need the added salt on the chicken. I used instant brown rice and kept the pan on low while it cooked; I also added black beans. Served with unsalted taco chips and corn bread.
I made this again, one week later. This time, I sauteed onion and green peppers, added white beans,pineapple chunks, and a pinch of cayenne, and used a peach-pineapple salsa. Delicious!

4 stars as written, minor modifications for even better results.

2 chicken breast sauteed with 1Tbs taco seasoning (although I wish I didnt use the packet as it became sticky. Next time a homemade taco seasoning or just some paprika and cumin.) ENSURE the broth is at a rolling boil before adding the rice, mine took a while too cook and I had a little extra mositure...boiling for a little longer should prevent this next time. ADDED half cup corn (great addition) and I topped with light coating of reduced fat cheese (1cup?). 

The bf LOVED it. Definetly make this again. Super fast. Super simple. And I had all the ingredients on hand.

As is, I believe this recipe is about a 3.5 taste wise.  Very simple to make though.  I used taco seasoning as suggested by some reviewers.  I also added garlic, paprika, oregano and parsley.  I changed the procedure slightly and cooked the rice separately so maybe that is why?  I used a lot less salsa, 3 tbs with the chicken with a bit of water rather than broth in the meat mixture.  The reason for reducing the salsa so much is due to children who do not like anything spicy.  I also added a can of black beans, 1/2 cup of corn and multi-colored bell peppers to the meat mixture as well.  Added a bit of shredded cheese with a dollop of sour cream to top off each serving.

I was wary on this one but after reading the reviews I tried it. My family loved it. We literally cleaned the pan. Great recipe. I did take a shortcut and bought a rotiserrie chicken and pulled off all the meat which shortened the prep time and was still delicious. Unbelievably tasty!!!!

This is wonderful and easy to make!  I would use MILD rotel in place of salsa.  It adds so much more flavor.  This is a definite repeat.  My family LOVED it!

Not bad! I didn't use Instant rice. I cooked two cups, and then spooned the chicken/salsa/broth mixture over individual servings of about 2 ice cream dippers on each plate. Also I tried using a drained can of Ro-Tel in place of the salsa. (mainly because I didn't want to go to the store to get salsa that I thought I had). The only thing I will do different next time is adding onions and garlic. However,  as is, it played to rave reveiws amongst a small group of family and friends. The best sign...no leftovers.

I would like to see this recipe amended so that the time for preparation and cooking is included and so that the issue of the rice (cooked or uncooked ??) is addressed.  I'm not that smart at cooking so I don't know these things.  Also, I would like to see what the change would be with regular (not instant) rice.  Thank You.

I made this dish exactly as stated not expecting it to be all that great, but it was good enough for a weekday meal and for lunch the next day. It tasted fine, and could be made special by adding other ingredients as some other reviewers did. One thing I liked about it was that you could make it with items you have on your shelf and without fresh ingredients as it is nice to have a few meals like this in your recipe file.

Great idea!  I used brown instant rice.  I used 1/2 tsp salt, pepper, paprika & cumin.  I added a bag of frozen corn, peppers & onions when it was done cooking.  I served this on soft tortillas with sour cream.  I also at it plain and it was good.  Will definitely make again.  5 Stars.

Very good dish! Like other reviews just used a little taco seasoning instead of salt and pepper...added jalapenos and used brown rice instead...easy and delicious!

This was a nice quick dish to prepare after dinner.  I added onion and hatch green chilies.  I am sure glad that I did, or I would be fearful that it would have been rather bland.  The dish is tasty, but for the calories of this dish, I think that there are some other dishes I would rather make.

This was really yummy, and oh so easy! I doubled the recipe, used fresh salsa, put the chicken in a bag and tossed with a package of low sodium taco seasoning and added a can of black beans rinsed and drained and cut the cheese down as suggested by others. Dh added some sliced serrano chili on his. next time I make this I would probably add some frozen corn to the mixture.

I read the reviews and added taco seasoning mix to the chicken and a can of Ro-Tel Mexican flavored chopped tomato with lime juice. I also threw in some chopped onion, bell pepper and green chilis, sort of in the "fajita" style. I refrigerated part and froze the rest in portion sized freezer bags for my teenagers to make healthy burritos from after school (instead of the other junk they usually eat!) They can just heat the packet in the microwave and wrap 'em up in a tortilla - I'll make it again with different ingredients; I think everyone at my house is gonna like this idea!

LOVED IT!!!  I added taco seasoning to the chicken while cooking in the olive oil.  Didn't have instant rice so used 1 cup regular rice and added 1 cup water.  Simmered for about 40 minutes.  Came out perfect and my hubby loved it!!

Excellent recipe!  Based on other's suggestions I did make a few additions including red kidney beans, corn and taco seasoning.  Loved the meal and my kids went wild scooping the mixture up with nacho chips and sour cream!  Will use leftovers for lunches tomorrow in a wrap!  Thanks for the great meal idea!

I had tossed some rice in my steamer and wanted something to go with it and came across this recipe. After reading the reviews I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and cumin and when it was done added Salsa, a can of corn and a can of black beans. We made burritos with it and it was very good! Will make again.

I used this recipe as a jumping off point. I cubed 1.5lbs of boneless/skinless chicken breasts and cooked them in olive oil with a packet of Taco Bell taco seasoning. Added some chicken broth (not sure how much), 2 packets of Taco Bell salsa from a taco kit (all I had), 1 can of well rinsed black beans, 1 can of rinsed corn niblets, and about 1.5C uncooked brown rice. I then just let everything simmer for over an hour. After it was all cooked, I decided it needed more tomatoes, so I added 1 can of diced tomatoes. In the future, if I'm short on salsa I'll be sure to add the tomatoes earlier so they absorb the taco flavor better. I completely forgot to add cheese, but it was still *delicious*! I'm sure a little cheese, as well as some sour cream would enhance this further. Anyway, needless to say, this is a definite keeper. As a base that you can modify, I think it's great. As a complete recipe, I imagine it'd be awfully bland. Regardless, thanks for a great idea! :)

Very good! we changed it up a little. We added bell peppers and onions (frozen), we used 1/2 - 2/3 can of cheddar cheese soup instead of the shredded cheese and we added some black olives. Super good and filling.

You should definitely add that the rice needs to be cooked FIRST if you are not using instant rice.

I loved this recipe.  I only gave it 4 stars because I did alter the recipe as others suggested.  I cooked the cubed chicken in about 2 tbsp of butter (I prefer the flavor over oil - I know not good for you).  Then I added a package of fajita seasoning to spice up the chicken in place of the salt and pepper.  I only used about half the can of chicken broth and used a whole 16 oz. jar of Pace's chuncky salsa.  While all of that was cooking I cooked two boil-in-bag's of rice in the microwave for about 7 minutes.  When they were done I added almost all of both bags (maybe about 1 1/2) to the chicken mixture and topped with the cheese.  I covered and let sit.  This was delicious and easy.  One of the first recipes I've found that both my boyfriend and I enjoyed!

My favourite stand-by recipe. The only thing I do differently is I add half a package of fajita seasoning when I'm cooking the chicken and then the other half when I'm boiling the broth and salsa.  Gives it a little more flavour!

Very good and easy!! I added some chopped onion and minced garlic when sauteeing the chicken, and it turned out great! Good last-minute meal and it tastes awesome!! :) It's good with or without the sour cream.

This is one of my favorite dishes when I am in the mood for semi-mexican flavors.  It is so quick and easy.  Not to mention, its amazing in taste.  The only difference I do is roll the chicken in taco seasoning before cooking.  I also add the green chilies with salsa and chicken broth.  Then, I serve wtih a dallop of sour cream on top...fabulous!!!  Try it, you'll love it!! Thanks!!!

Excellent dish.  I didn't have salsa, so I sauteed onions and green bell pepper with the chicken and added diced tomatoes.  Had to let it sit a little longer to make sure all the rice was soft. My husband took it to work and now I have a request to make a batch for the guys :-).

This recipe turned out great and was so easy!  My husband did not like it as much as I did though.  I cooked up some brown rice separate and served the salsa chicken over top of the rice and then sprinkled cheddar cheese on top.  To make the chicken sauc, I first sauteed half of a medium onion in some butter and then I added the chicken cubes.  I cooked the chicken in salt and pepper, and then squirted lime juice on top to give it some zing.  Then I added a whole 16 oz tub fresh summer salsa and let it simmer with the chicken until it reduced a bit.  Then I added 1/2 cup of sour cream to make it a cream sauce.  I served it over the brown rice then added cheese.  I think next time I will go ahead and mix it with the rice.  I think this would make an excellent filling for tacos or burritos!  Thanks for the recipe, it gave me some great ideas and I will DEFINATELY make this again!!!

Excellent recipe!  I like how you can take control of the heat factor by the type of salsa you use....this is a keeper.

This one gets a 5 star for flavor - I used fresh salsa so it was amazing.  It also gets 5 stars for simplicity.  The only other change I made was to do as another had suggested and coated my chicken in Taco Seasoning (also from this site - I always keep it on hand).  My husband loved it and said it was definitely a keeper.    In the future I would probably not use an instant rice and I think I am going to try it with sausage as well.  Thank you Jamey for sharing.  :-)

What a wonderful quick meal - I needed a very fast dinner and had chicken tenderloins.  I browned them and didn't cut them up.  All I had was regular rice so I just barely browned them.  I also didn't have salsa so I used a can of Rotel.  So I had to cook for 20 min and that worked out great.  With the rice, broth and Rotel I put in onion, garlic powder, Fiesta seasoning, taco seasoning and cumin.  When the rice was done I added a can of black beans and a can of corn.  The leftovers were even better the next day - had 2 great meals for very little effort and an awesome one pan dish.

I used brown rice and it takes a little longer to cook.  I used GOOD salsa not el paso and bought rotisserie chicken and shredded it (I was short on time) followed the rest of the recipe as noted except for adding Bijol (yellow coloring that latins use in arroz con pollo).  It was delicious.  Thanks :)

Made this tonight. It was very tasty. I used taco seasoning in with the chicken as suggested so I didn't add salt or pepper and used No salt added chicken broth. Turned out excellent...I will definitely make it again.

I was really excited about this recipe, but it was not good at all. It came out way too soupy, even after I cut the broth down a little. I had to serve it with a slotted spoon and it was still way too soupy. And the rice was undercooked and I had to cook it more, but it was still kind of gross. Great idea, doesn't work at all.

This was an excellent recipe. I didn't use instant rice and only used about 4 ounces of hot Pace salsa and it was quite spicy, but still yummy. Used about 1 1/2 lbs chicken.  Browned the chicken with 1/2 cup diced onion and 1 Tbsp. butter then added put it all in the rice cooker (except the cheese) and let it do the work for me. So good!

I rated it 4 stars due to all the changes I had to make to it. For me, the recipe was too "box like" and basic and with a few simple additions, it was fantastic. I cooked mexican rice II (from allrecipes), seasoned the diced chicken with salt, pepper, and cumin, browned it, then added 10 ounces of salsa, a bit less than a whole can of black beans, a can of green chilis, and some corn. I completely omited the chicken stock since I cooked the rice on the side. Once the mixture started to boil, I added the already cooked mexican rice and stirred. I used 4 oz of cheddar cheese which was perfect. My family LOVED it.

I used one cup of diced tomatoes with garlic and basil instead of salsa, I poured one packet of taco seasoning into the mix, reduced the broth to a half cup, and used jasmine rice (my favorite). It was a big hit with husband!

This recipe was pretty amazing. My husband and I give it a 4. Pairs well with cornbread on the side to help with the spiceyness. I added frozen vegetables (corn, onion, red and green pepper package) and taco seasoning. I was going to add black beans but I forgot them. I noticed though that I needed more liquid after we started chiding down. The rice wasn't able to fully cook because there was not enough liquid. Next time I might add a 1/2 cup of water just to be safe.

Followed the recipe exactly as written and it came out too salty for my taste. If I make it again I will probably completely omit the salt.

Cooked the chicken in crock pot the day before so it would be quicker on the night that I made the recipe.  Cooked the rice (used brown rice) first in water and some taco seasoning.  Only used 4-6oz cheese to keep it lower fat.  Served with a little sour cream.  Next time will add black beans (I meant to this time but forgot).  Very good quick and easy dish.

I made this last night for the first time. The recipe was very easy to put together, but I thought it tasted a bit bland. However, that could be because of the salsa, which was mild. I'll try it next time with maybe half medium salsa and half hot. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!! :)

This was fantastic! I cut the amount of rice in half, leaving it more soupy. I also added a can of black beans & a little bit of sour cream, then served for dinner with tortilla chips. My husband and 2 yr-old son loved it! I'm definitely saving this recipe!

This as quick, easy, but average. I left it covered for 15 minutes and the rice was not as soft as we would have liked. My husband put his in a soft tortilla and said it made a good burrito.

Loved this receipe.  I pan roasted 5 large bone in chicken breasts at 350 degrees for 40 minutes after they where washed, patted dry with paper towel, drizzeled with a good olive oil and plenty of kosher salt and black pepper.  After they rested for 15 minutes I shredded them.  Meanwhile, in a dutch oven, I sauteed one yellow onion cut into rings.  Added the Chicken, 1 can of Chicken Stock, and 1/2 quart of homeade salsa.  I added the rice, cut it down to low and cooked on stove top for 30 minutes.  Then I stirred it, and added one more can of chicken stock and about 1/2 cu of salsa.  Covered it, and Cooked for 30 more minutes.  I then cut it off.  Put the cheddar cheese on top and covered it again for ten minutes.  It is a very very tasty receipe!  Thanks!

I changed this so much it may not even qualify as the same recipe. I needed to cut back on the spice, so I marinaded the sliced chicken in a mixture of taco seasoning (from this site) with 1/4 cup of olive oil, 2 Tbsp white wine and 2 Tbsp lemon juice. Then I drained the marinade and stir fried the chicken at medium-high for a few minutes until done and browned. Put it on top of rice and then, for those who wanted it, put salsa on top of that. Those with tender tummies had it without the salsa - and it is delicious!

Coated chicken cubes with chili powder. Added onion and green pepper when browning chicken. Added black beans when chicken was cooked. Added corn to boiling mixture, before rice.

Not bad, but it seemed like something was missing. I did use brown rice that I cooked ahead of time, so that might of been if. Next time I may try adding some green chilies.

Definitely needs green onions.  Also, I seasoned the chicken with my homemade taco seasoning that is awesome.  And I made the rice into a burrito with guacamole, sour cream, reduced fat cheese, and black beans.  It was great!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because it would probably have been a bit bland for us without the changes I made.  I sprinkled the chicken pieces with some taco seasoning, then sauteed with a sliced onion and a couple cloves of minced fresh garlic.  I used my home-made salsa, and also added some frozen corn.  I thought the rice/liquid ratio was off, so I only used 1 cup of instant rice, and it turned out perfect.  I made this early in the day, then poured it into a casserole dish, topped with shredded cheese, and aluminum foil, then refrigerated it.  30 minutes in the oven before dinner time, and it was ready.  I served it with tortilla chips and sour cream.  It was delicious!  This will be a regular for us.

Thought this was great. I made my chicken bite size and sauteed yellow onion while browning the chicken. I used picante sauce since it was all I had. In the future I would like a little more chunchs of tomatoes so I may chane to a regular salsa.

This was great- fast, easy and super flavorful. I used our favorite salsa, Garden Fresh, and there was no need to make any modifications. I'll definitely make this again!

We weren't huge fans of this.  But...I'm willing to say that some of it could have been the salsa we used.  I think it I had made it with pace rather than the salsa I did, it might have turned out much better.  I will probably give it one more shot to just see.  Keeping my fingers crossed b/c it was really easy to make!

Really quick to throw together! I added garlic powder and onion powder to the chicken, crushed red pepper instead of black pepper. Instead of the olive oil, I cooked the chicken in 1/2C of broth. The rest of the broth was omitted because I used cooked rice instead. Next time I'd add cumin and fresh cilantro. Great and quick!

This is an interesting idea, and it WAS really easy... but the recipe calls for waaay too much rice. That is why it's bland. I might try cooking it again with about half the rice, and more southwest seasoning.

This is great, simple, and FAST! I chopped up some red onions, green bell peppers, a large tomato, and some garlic... let that go over medium heat with some oil... then added the cubed chicken. Didn't have chicken broth on hand, so I used some water and Beef Stock had... added salt/pepper/garlic powder... and of course the salsa... then brought to a boil. I put it into another pot (skillet wasn't holding it!) ... then added the cheese and a bit more salsa from another jar just for kicks! It is GREAT! Thanks again for the super easy recipe! -erica b.

So simple, yet so good! So quick... I had this on the table in 30 minutes (including defrosting the chicken). I used plenty of garlic powder while cooking the chicken and added a can of whole kernel corn. I used Black Bean and Corn Salsa from Wal-Mart, which was really good in this. I also only used 1 cup of rice and found that was plenty. Served with warm flour tortillas and sour cream on top. Yum! Thanks!

Wow, what a great recipe! I added sour cream and a can of drained black beans, next time I cook this I'll also add a can of corn and green peppers. My only suggestion is to cook the rice seperate then mix together. My rice wasn't fully cooked even after letting it sit close to 20 minutes.

I really liked this recipe. I didnt have instant rice on hand so I had to use the other stuff. I just added more chicken broth so the rice would have more time to simmer. My 7 year old son on the other hand liked only the chicken and wouldnt touch the rice which is why I can only give it 4 stars.

Delicious. I add a tsp of chili powder, a tsp of cumin, and substitute seasoned salt for regular salt when pan-frying the chicken. I also add 1/2 c of corn with the broth for some additional texture. We also use the brown rice and the 2% shredded Cheddar. I don't really measure the cheese, I just sprinkle some on there for the flavor. Love this recipe!

I made this last night for me and my boyfriend and we really enjoyed it.  I added some taco seasoning, and used rotel instead of salsa.  Also added a can of corn and black beans.  I used it as a burrito filling as other suggested and we just added cheese to our burritos instead of the whole dish.  I will definitely make this again...and hopefully have some sour cream on hand!

This stuff was AMAZING!  The recipes says to stir in the rice then put on the cheese and cover it, I suggest to stir in the rice, and cover it for a minute or 2, then put on the cheese and let it sit for 5 min or more....just so the rice would fully get cooked.  I also used brown rice and fat free cheese to make it more diet friendly for my mom.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly as it says and it turned out FANTASTIC!

I prepared this for a party and it was a HUGE hit.  Everyone loved it!  The only changes I made were that I grilled the chicken beforehand about 80% done and then I put the pieces in the oil with some taco seasoning, garlic powder and pepper.  I took other reviewers advice and used instant rice, but I used Mexican flavored rice (like rice-a-roni) instead of plain white rice.  Also, I used a Mexican cheese blend instead of just cheddar.  This is a GREAT dish (and so easy) and I'll be making it again for the family in the near future.

This is a great last minute dinner! As a busy mom of 3 kids all under age 5, this was a cinch to make. It's tasty as is, but fun to play with too. I used fresh salsa and mexican blend shredded cheese (what I had on hand). I cook the chicken with dried minced garlic, onion and a dash of cumin. I also subbed in instant brown rice for the white rice and topped each serving off with a tablespoon of lowfat sour cream. I didn't feel a lick of guilt gobbling this down! This one's goin' in my recipe box! Thanks!

This recipe was excellent! My whole family enjoyed it very much. I took the advice of others and added a can of corn and a can of mushrooms and it tasted wonderful. Next time I'll try making it with black beans.

My family liked it but it was definitely too much rice...  it made it dry.  But with the right rice consistency it would be very good.  I added a little sour cream to the mix, as well.

Yummy, and so easy to make... the only change I would make is to cut the amount of cheese in half.  I love cheese, but that was too much for me.

This was great!  I skipped the S&P and seasoned the chicken as it was cooking with Penzey's fajita seasoning instead (1 1/2 - 2 tsp).  In the end, this turned out plenty salty from the broth (used Penzey's chicken base for that); had I salted the meat, think it would have been far too salty.  Also used half cheddar and half Mexican blend shredded cheeses.  For me, the salsa negated any need for extra onion or green chilies.  This had plenty of flavor!  I agree with others, though the instant rice makes this come together quickly and is a nice option, I'm going to try regular long grain rice next time.  The instant seems to crumble too easily.  I'll also boost the liquid a bit, mine got dry when sitting for a short while.  Overall, very simple and quite tasty!  I've tried similar recipes and in my opinion,  this one is considerably better.  A keeper -- thanks for sharing!

This is my daughter's favorite meal! I took the advice from another reviewer and added a taco seasoning packet to the chicken while it cooked in the skillet. I also use a whole jar (16 oz.) of salsa. The salsa really makes a difference in how good this will taste, so once you find a salsa that really compliments this dish, keep using it. I also add a can of drained and rinsed black beans when I add the rice. I like to put a lot of cheese on top, and then I let it all stand for about 20 minutes. I feel the longer you let it sit, the better. Don't worry-- After 20 minutes it's still plenty hot to eat.

This is a delicious chicken dish! However, it turned out kind of runny. I thought it was the frozen brown rice I used, but not sure. Aside from the runniness, it was very good.

Holy cow this is awesome! I substituted white rice for instant brown rice and tossed the cubed chicken in taco seasoning to up the flavor. I also added a can of rinsed black beans during the simmer step. Topped with a bit sour cream and a dash of dried cilantro (wish I had fresh on hand) this truly hit the spot. It'll be made again and again!

Very good!! Will definitely make again, but as others suggested, 2 cups of rice was way too much... I only ended up using 1 cup and I still think that was a bit much.  I did add a bit more salsa, put it in a tortilla and make it as a burrito.... Great starter recipe, many ways to change this.  Gonna try it with steak next time.

This was awesome! Had enough to take to work and share with a couple of friends, they also said how good it was.  And it had such simple ingredients. The hardest part was cutting up the chicken.  :)

This was easy to make.  I added taco seasoning and used brown rice.  I also added corn.  I think it would be good with black beans also.

Wonderfully easy, delicious and filling.  Thank you Jamey for your recipe, I've made it twice in the last week and have shared with several friends.  The only thing I changed is to cook brown rice in broth, add to the chicken, added a little corn and some olives, put the salsa in, mixed it altogether added a little cheese put the lid on and cooked for about 5 min. on low.  Sooooooo yummy!  Even the leftovers tonight!

This is my first review ever and this recipe has to be one of the best dishes I have ever made. Used a mild salsa and added 1 Tbsp of dried minced garlic to the salsa and chicken broth before adding to the pan. Also sprinkled 1 tsp or so of oregano onto the chicken while browning. So much flavor and so easy to prepare. Loved it!!!!

4 stars as written, i added taco seasoning and corn to the mix, meant to throw in some black beans but forgot. i think it would lack a little flavor without the taco seasoning. great base recipe though and very easy to tinker with and improve. can always add different things each time you make it. also very easy to throw together, wich i loved. keeping this one.

I made the recipe just as it reads (using medium salsa, for a slight kick), and I thought it was absolutely PERFECT!  However, I do like the suggestions of using taco seasoning, mexican veggies, corn, and sour cream.  Now I can't wait to make it again!

This is really good. The first time I had it, I thought I was just hungry, it didn't seem as though it should be this good. But it is. And I used a mild salsa since I can stand a bit of spice, but not really hot.

Very tasty and easy to make.  Did not have instant rice so used regular.  I cut it to 1.5 cups but it was still too much.  Next time I will use 1 cup.  Think I will add some peas as well.  Seemed to need something else.  Will diffidently make again.

Pretty good!  Tossed chicken in taco seasoning before cooking.  Used 3 bags of rice-in-a-bag so used more chicken broth ~ 2 1/2 cups.  And covered at the end to cook rice through.  Added corn and black beans.  

Served with cornbread.

It was rather " soupy "  & kinda looked pinkish. I would try it again but I'd use less salsa & less chicken broth.

I made this recipe tonight and it was a huge hit with my husband and 17-year old son. I did make a few adjustments similar to those I read in other reviews. I added one package of taco mix to add some flavor, I used a 16 oz jar of salsa, and substituted instant brown rice vs white rice. I did have to add about a cup of add'l water and simmer for about 15 minutes to make sure the rice cooked all the way through. Then I topped with the cheese (I used about half the amount the recipe called for) and served once melted. I served with homemade guacamole and sour cream. This will become a regular meal in our house. Thanks for sharing.

Made the recipe as written except for adding corn with the salsa and broth.  Next time, I will use medium salsa as it needed more flavor.  Family also thought there was too much cheese.

5 star fabulous!  I was wondering what I could do with my leftover chicken today, and this recipe popped up in my mailbox.  I served it with Scoops, sour cream, and jalapenos, and everyone loved it (husband and 2 kids- ages 12 and 9).  Unbelievably easy, fast, and delicious.  A keeper~ thank you Jamey!

This recipe was quick, easy, and actually pretty tasty. The only changes I made are as followed: added taco seasoning to the chicken after cubing, used whole wheat instant rice and much less cheese. Overall, a great recipe!

I add can of rotel, and cilantro. The salsa that you use makes all the difference. I love this recipe, it's quick and yummy. Great for potlucks, total crowd pleaser, can be easily doubled.

Great!  I did not have instant rice, so I used regular rice and simmered it for 30 minutes.  I also tossed chicken in taco seasoning as per other suggestions.

This made for a quick and easy dinner.  My kids put this into tortillas and rolled them up, and my husband and I used tortilla chips to scoop it up and eat it.  This was a great family meal and was also great as leftovers.

I had regular rice, and no shredded cheese.  So, I cooked the rice separately, omitted the broth and used a can of cheddar cheese soup.  It was still really good!  Thank you for the quick yummy recipe!

Used ground chicken thighs and taco seasoning as suggested in most reviews.  Added corn & green chiles also.  Excellent!  Only gave 4 stars because of the additions.  Great base for a ton of kitchen fun!

This dish is so good. I will definitely make it again. The only thing I did differently was I seasoned my chicken with Emeril Essence. I also added the cheese at the very end instead of with the rice. I served it all in a bowl with warm buttered tortillas.

AWESOME!!! My husband and I LOVED this recipe! I put a little more salsa and rice in it and I also put Cheddar and Feta cheese on top! It was a wonderful recipe and you pretty much have all the ingredients in the house already which makes it even better!

Tasty!  I really enjoyed this meal.  It was easy to make, quick and I didn't need a bunch of ingredients.  I only used half the amount of cheese and it turned out as good as expected.  Don't get me wrong, I love cheese, but I am trying to stretch my dollar, so I used less.  Fantastic!  Thank you!

This is very good as is (thus the 4 stars), but use taco seasoning on the chicken and top with a dollop of sour cream and its a 5 star recipe!  My VERY picky son LOVED it!  Good stuff!

I really did love this recipe! BUT instead of salt and pepper i added a package of taco seasoning. It was the perfect taste for this recipe. And i only did 1 1/2 cups rice. Wonderful food for the whole family. thanks

Good recipe! I used instant brown rice and added an extra can of stewed tomatoes to add more "umph". I served it over a bed of greens and with tortilla chips and EVERYONE loved it. It's versatile enough that you could add a few more veggies too. Definitely will make again. Thanks!

This recipe ended up in our regular rotation from the start.  The whole family enjoys it, from my mom who's 90, down to our 15-year-old son.  When it's been a while since we've had it, someone will always say, it's about time for "salsa chicken" again!  I made it as the recipe states several times and then added black beans and a couple of dashes of hot sauce, or a spicier salsa, and we like it that way, too.  A quick, simple and tasty chicken dish.

Served with fresh guacamole and chips.  Flavor was very good, my little 5 year old gobbled it right up.  Preparation was simple;  took less than 30 minutes to get this on the table, so this is a great meal for busy weeknights.  My only issue was that the finished product was very soupy.  The liquid to rice ratio was way off for me.  I used instant rice when preparing this so perhaps that was part of the problem.  I typically steer clear of the instant stuff.  Since the flavor was good I will try this recipe again except next time I will use regular rice instead of instant and make sure I have the correct ration of liquid to rice (2:1).

I thought this was wonderful, I also coated my chicken in some taco seasoning before browning and I added a can of black beans (drained) and some frozen corn. I also used regular long grain rice, I just added and extra half of can of broth and just simmered it for 20 minutes covered and it turned out wonderful!  After the rice cooked all the way I dumped the mixture into a caserole dish topped with the cheese and stuck it in a 350 degree oven until the cheese was melted.  We dished it directly into a flour tortilla and it was perfect!! Thanks!

Pretty good...tastes a lot like similar recipes. I think 2 cups is too much rice, or there needs to be more liquid. I ended up adding 8 oz. more of salsa, and some water, too.

I think that this is better if you add some additional ingredients like peppers and onions.  I added peppers, onions, and mushroom.  I cooked conventional rice in a rice cooker and then added the rice at the end.

I made this recipe last night because it contained the only things I had in my pantry!  At first I thought I was going to screw it up because I didn't have instant rice and instead used whole grain rice to make it healthier.  I cooked it separately until it was almost done and then added to the chicken/salsa mixture.  Because I didn't have the instant rice to suck up the liquid, it was pretty watery at first.  I just drained off the liquid and it was perfect.  I served topped w/ Fat Free Sour Cream and fresh sliced avocado's.  It was delicious, and SO easy!!  It tastes like a healthy version of Arroz con Pollo from our favorite Mexican restaurant.  The only thing I plan to change for next time is to add jalepeno's for some spice.

This is the first recipe on this site I've reviewed because I was soooo pleased! I was desperate to think of something to make for dinner and chose this because I actually had all the ingredients on hand and it looked quick! I was not disappointed!! I used brown rice instead of white and added some black beans when I added the rice. Other than that, followed the recipe to the tee. I served it with a dollap of sour cream on top and the fam all raved including 2 kiddos. Hubby said it tasted just like Chicken Enchiladas! I can't speak high enough about this recipe and how good it tastes esp considering how easy it is to make with ingredients I almost always have on hand and it's a one skillet deal!

This recipe is wonderful. The flavors are delicious and even one of the most picky eaters in my family loved it. I used homemade salsa, which tends to be really spicy so i cut back on how much i put in. Plus adding some taco seasoning is a very good choice.

This is really good with ground turkey or beef and added zucchini. I also use real rice otherwise my husband complains.  It is much easier with the instant stuff though!

I too added taco seasoning to the chicken before cooking and it was great. I added a drained can of corn. I used monteray jack and it was great served with sour cream on top. Will be making over and over again.

This was good with the suggestions of the other reviewers. My husband loved it, but I felt that it was missing something. I didn't have instant rice, so I made rice with the broth and then added it (as suggested by another) to the chicken.

It was good, but I will change a few things. I will add green peppers and onion and reduce the cheese. I love cheese but this was toooo much. I will make again.

I sauteed half a chopped green bell pepper, half a chopped onion & 2 cloves of minced garlic with the chicken, and added about 2 tsp. taco seasoning. Used 1 cup of jasmine rice in place of instant rice. Omitted cheese. Very simple delicious dinner.

This was great and my teen daughter had seconds and even ate leftovers, which she NEVER does.  I added an entire jar of salsa to give it a little more kick.  But now I have a way to make a chicken-rice dish my kids really enjoy.

Super simple especially if you have the chicken cut up and frozen already.  Tastes very similar to cheesy chicken tortilla soup that many restaraunts have.  The whole family loved it, even my five year old!

This was a good, fast recipe for a weeknight dinner.  We will be making it again, but next time I think I might use normal long grain rice and bake it, rather than minute rice on the stove.

I was delightfully surprized by this recipe.  It was YUMMY!!  I made the following changes.... I used wild rice instead of white instant. Just cook the rice according to directions... and I used "Sam's" black bean and corn salsa for the salsa add.

This recipe will go into my scrapbook of favorites and will be served again and again.

Great recipe, my boyfriend loved it! Very little effort for a great meal. I changed a bit by using 16 oz. of salsa, using brown rice instead of white and I added a tbsp. of red pepper flakes for some extra spice. I'll definately be making this again!

My husband enjoyed this but I didn't even finish my first helping... I expected more flavor than it had, and I even tossed the chicken in taco seasoning before cooking. If I make it again, I will use a spicier salsa to add some flavor.

Of course, this turned out great :o) ... I used a couple of shortcuts to make it even quicker.  When I boil chicken for a stew I cook up extra for meals like this.  It'll keep in the fridge a good while, and I can throw it in a bowl with some precooked rice (I always make extra when I cook some up, it'll also keep a nice while in the fridge), some fresh salsa, low fat sour cream, pre grated cheese, stir it all up, plop in a casserole dish, top with more grated cheese, pop it in the oven for as long as I feel like (20 - 45 min @ 350 or so) and - voila!  We're good to go!  Next time I'm going to add in some sliced olives, and double the amount I make (to wrap in tortillas the next day).

I followed this recipe exactly. The rice turned out perfect and it had an excellent taste! We topped ours with sour cream and wrapped it in tortillas. My husband didn't even leave any leftovers, he loved it so much. Also- it is SO quick to make! It was done in around 10 to 15 minutes. I will definitely be making this easy delicious recipe again.

My husband and I thought this was really good.  I cooked the chicken with some chopped onion and seasoned with some taco seasoning, cumin and garlic.  When I added the rice, I also added a can of black beans (rinsed) and a can of corn.  I did not put the cheese on/into chicken rice mixture.  I served it on tortillas with cheese, sour cream and taco sauce.

My husband went bonkers over this.  He says it is reason to keep a supply of sour cream handy.  Instead of using instant rice, I make regular rice and just mix it together at the end.  He actually gets excited when I make this.  Very Odd.  I suspect there is some sort of hidden male hormone triggering ingredient in this. ;)

This is very good.  I have made it many times.   I even swapped out the chicken with seasoned (taco seasoning) ground beef and that was a big hit.  We also like to use this as a filling for a totilla shell.  Yum!

A good quick recipe to use when the imagination just doesn't want to work.  I too added taco seasoning to the chicken while it cooked, and it turned out great.  I used Medium salsa, and just a warning: this definitely gets hotter the next day (much like anything with spice).  Very tasty though.

Very cheesy! I followed the recipe as is and found the chicken to be a little bland for my taste. No problem, that is completely fixable. My husband didn't see it as a complete meal though. I have to figure out what to serve it with next time.

Very good and easy to make. I used brown rice(all I had), can of green chilies and a can of black beans. I served with a dollop of sour cream. Will be making again, thanks for recipe.

I made this the other night for my boyfriend and I  - we LOVED it!  We also put a little bit of sour cream on top.  The leftovers are just as good as when it is freshly made.  I can't wait to make it again!! :-)

This recipe was very very good!  My family loved it.  I used brown rice that I had already cooked the day before and made my own salsa.  The cheese on top really finished it off perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum! I added a can of corn like everyone said to do and thought it was great. It makes it stretch for a bigger family too. The thing about this recipe is that it is super easy!

This was good and easy to make.  I used brown rice instead of white, and it was moist and flavorful.  I will make this again.

This was a hit!  Everyone had seconds and requested for lunch the next day.  I used 1 cup rice and 1 can of black beans.  I doubled the salsa (I used black bean and corn salsa) and halved the chicken broth since I prepared the rice separately.  I served with the little round Tostitos tortilla chips and sour cream on the side so it was almost like dip.  The rice and beans were fantastic, next time I won't even add chicken.  This made 8 filling servings for us and tasted just as good the next day.

My husband and I really liked this. I made a half batch but I’ll makes full one next time for leftovers. It was a little soupy, which could be my measurements for half. I may add more rice and no salt (salsa already had enough). Will make it again.

My parents really enjoyed it and I thought it was OK. I added a bit of rice  and cheese to my personal taste. If I make again in the future, I will probably use a non-instant rice for a bit of a better flavor because the rice was a bit bland.

YUM!!! So simple, so tasty! I was skeptical but oh man it’s delicious. Definitely season the chicken a bit. I didn’t have taco seasoning so I just used some regular Monterey chicken seasoning but it is absolutely delicious. I love cheese and I wanted a lot of rice to make it extra filling so I stayed pretty true to the recipe, but you could definitely add some corn or peppers and cut out a bit on the rice and cheese! Regardless I am super impressed!

Good recipe followed as is (except I didn't use instant rice, and I made the rice in the broth). I don't think I would make again, but the flavor was nice. My husband kind of liked it, too, but was kind of indifferent; I think we both were. This recipe makes quite a bit as written.

Delicious, my picky family loved it. I added some homemade fajita season to the chicken as it was cooking and threw in some peppers and celery too. My husband was a little late for supper so instead of covering it, I laid the pan in the oven to keep in warm. Definitely a keeper, thanks!

This was an awesome recipe. We did add 1 taco seasoning to the chicken while frying, then added another when we put the salsa and chicken broth. Once back to boil I added black beans,  2 cans green chilies, 4 raw jalapeños, 1-10oz frozen-onion, 1-12oz frozen corn, and 1-14oz frozen pepper strips. I will definitely be making this again. Family loved it, and it’s easy to make.

This was very quick and easy.  I did add taco seasoning, pepper, 1/2 large chopped onion and a chopped bell pepper to the chicken cubes while cooking.  No salt.  I added one can of Rotel and one can of Mexi corn.  It was delicious!

Made this last night and it was delicious!! Can't wait to have it again!
I didn't have chicken broth so I used vegetable and it turned out great. I'll try it next time with the chicken broth but I don't think it can get any better!
Thanks for sharing this one!
UPDATE: Made this the other night with ground beef and it was as delicious as the chicken! Love that it's versatile!

This dish was a hit with our family.  Since it was my first time that I made this, I didn't change anything but next time I will add a bit more salsa for flavor  and cut my chicken cubes much smaller.  I definitely recommend this recipe!

It you have kids or folks who can't tolerate spicy heat, careful to check for mild salsa.  Even the rice was too spicy for my kids.  Minute rice or instant rice works if you're pressed for time, but I'm going to go for healthier rice or quinoa next time.  This is great for using up leftover veggies, including onion, corn, carrots and sweet peppers.  If it's too spicy for you, adding frozen veggies and letting it simmer helps a lot.  Maybe I went overboard with the chicken broth, but I did have to let the rice simmer longer in order for the extra liquid to evaporate.  Will use the recipe again. Very simple one-pan recipe!

Made this tonight with a few changes. Cooked the chicken and seasoned with taco seasoning. Used homemade salsa and also added corn, black beans, and rotel. Used long grain white rice (not instant cuz all I had). Topped/baked final long enough to melt cheese in a casserole dish. Served topped with a spoon of sour cream and sliced jalapeno peppers. Went over very well. (Only gave 4 stars cuz of all the changes I made)

This was soooo tasty!  I took the advice of other reviewers (I always read the reviews first) and put my own taco seasoning on the chicken (I don't use packaged stuff) while I sauteed it.  My kids stuffed tortilla shells with it.  The whole family loved it and it was so easy to make!

This recipe is delicious flavor wise, but I made it I believe 3 times so far and I can get the darn rice cooked all the way through!! I think I was using basmati rice because that is all I had in the cabinet. So next time, I will be sure to use the correct rice and hope I can enjoy it once and for all!!
-- used minute rice this time - turned out perfect!!

This is a favorite in our house. I add taco seasoning to the chicken when cooking, and I add a can of black beans that have been drained and rinsed. Super simple, quick dinner that feeds a crowd. Great the next day with tortilla chips:)

I have made this recipe many times for my family, and they love it! I do make a few changes. In addition to the salt and pepper seasoning on the chicken I add half a packet of taco seasoning. I also use my own homemade salsa and I use white American cheese (shredded) instead of the cheddar cheese.  Otherwise I make exactly as stated and it turns out great!!!!

The entire family LOVED it! I did increase the recipe size. I did 2 cans of Campbells chicken broth, 3 heaping cups of rice, 12 oz. of Pace picante sauce and 2 lbs. of  chicken.  It served 5 teenagers and 2 parents.

WOW!!!  This is off the charts good!  I've only rated 2 recipes...this and maw maw's chicken and rice.  Both are so great that I wouldn't feel right about not rating them!  Don't shoot me, but i did add some taco seasoning to the chicken.  Served with warm cut-up tortillas.  YUM!  As an added bonus, the kids want it for their school lunch tomorrow.

It's good! Easy and fast to make, I did make a small tweak and used taco cheese instead of cheddar cheese (I just happen to have some sitting around). Based on some of the reviews it sounded like the recipe needed a little seasoning boost anyways.

It was inexpensive, cheap, and so easy my 10 year old made it from the directions.  She did use regular rice because I forgot to get the instant rice, but it worked out just fine.  I doubt it changed it much.  I liked that the cheese was added at the end.  My little guy can have extra cheese and I can have light cheese, nice.

Super quick and easy..and cheap..and delicious! The only change I made was using a can of cream of chicken because I was out of chicken broth. I'm sure it was more creamy this was but tasted great! I will definitely be making this again and again. Thank you!

Delicious!! I used regular rice instead of instant, so I just needed to add about 3/4 cup more chicken broth to cook the rice. Also, I made it the way the recipe stated, but I think next time I'd add more chicken to balance the amount of rice.

This was a hit with the entire family. The following changes made based on reviews: 1) I started by sautéing 1/2 c chopped onions. 2) I added broth, store brand salsa and 1 1/2 lb cooked cubed chicken (that was sprinkled with taco seasoning) and 1 c frozen corn. 3) once the mix came to a boil I added 3/4 c regular rice. 4) simmered until the rice was cooked. Served on 6" flour tortilla with salsa and shredded cheddar.

Was really easy to make. I even turned it into a casserole dish. I cooked the chicken, then added everything into the casserole dish. Needed more seasoning though we I added Tony Chachere's original seasoning and it was perfect.

Really good but made some changes.  Used regular rice instead of instant, sauteed onion with the chicken and seasoned with adobo and taco seasoning.  Used a can of drained black beans and a small drained can of corn so it was more of a complete meal in a skillet!  The addition of the veggies, however ,made the rice start to stick, so I added more salsa in addition to the recommended 8 oz., and also had to add a little water because it took longer for the regular rice to cook.  Was really tasty and easy.  Will be making this again since I usually have all of the ingredients on hand.

This is a delicious recipe.  It is wholesome enough for dinner and fast enough to make for lunch. When I make it for dinner I add some veggies (corn, green beans, etc.) to it. I love it with some sour cream mixed in.

This was DELICIOUS! It was also so simple to make!  What I did a little different is put a little more salsa, seasoned the chicken with taco seasoning, and added frozen vegetables.  You can also add beans but I didn't do that because my husband is not so crazy about eating beans.  I made my own taco seasoning.  It was so easy.  I googled what was in taco seasoning and I already had all the spices mentioned.  So I saved some money there!  Taco seasoning has salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, red pepper flakes, chili or cayenne powder, paprika, and oregano.

I tried it because of the simplicity. I do believe simple can be wonderful. This was ehh but easy. I needed a easy after work recipe that would use salsa I had in the fridge before it spoiled and instant rice as well that I had on hand. I already had frozen cooked chicken in the freezer. This wound up being a good starter recipe. It needed more liquid to cook through and it was bland. I added sour cream and all the extra "mexican" seasonings. After that it was pretty good. I made cornbread on the side as suggested. I think corn would have been a great add in. Also black beans would be too if eaten with tortilla chips. Thank you for submitting this!

Very very good. I made it exactly as the recipe instructed. As good as it was, I will make some modifications next time around. 1 1/2 lbs. of chicken. Only 4 oz. of cheese. 12 oz. of salsa. And I will add veggies and beans.

So easy! My male friend that was 40 before he learned to make a grilled cheese or scramble eggs can make this. If you are putting together recipes for people going out on their own that need to be easy to build their confidence, include this one for sure!

I usually add 1/2 a can of drained black beans and would recommend that. I have also added taco seasoning, extra spicy salsa for a kick, or just more salsa for a higher ratio of it to rice - but this recipe is great as is with no alterations. 

It can also be used as a burrito filling or tostada base.

HAVE SOUR CREAM ON HAND!!

This recipe was so tasty and so easy! I too added taco seasoning to the chicken while cooking and a can of black beans. I don't use instant rice so I cooked it ahead of time and then added the rice at the end. We topped it with Greek yogurt(in place of sour cream), cheese and more salsa. This is a keeper!!!

Would give 5 stars but I didn't follow recipe exactly, not an instant rice fan. Very delicious recipe tho! Took someone else's idea on taco seasoning. I like that the ingredients are easy to have around the house.

I only made it four stars because we do alter the recipe -we add a can of UNDRAINED Rotel (mild if there are kids, original for some spice) to add moisture and flavor and with that we LOVE this recipe! Everything else stays the same as the original recipe and we love this!!

I have been making this recipe since 2009 and should have reviewed it much earlier.  It's an easy-to-make, great-tasting recipe.  I've modified here and there, but stick with this basic recipe.  Now my daughters are making it in college because it's just that easy and a crowd pleaser.

This was great! I used regular rice (pre cooked) and just boiled a few bullion cubes in a cup of water instead of using the 14 oz can. was great! Thanks!

Really good, really easy made as is first time and it is a keeper. Second time added taco seasoning to the chicken as suggested by some reviews but it just comes off the chicken when you add the broth and salsa. Still I suppose it adds some extra flavor.

This was delicious and so easy to make! I used regular rice instead of instant and added it after the broth and salsa came to a boil. I cooked for an additional 15-20 minutes and added the cheese at the very end, just long enough to melt a bit. This recipe is definitely a keeper! Next time I will change it up a bit to play with flavors, but it is definitely great as is.

My whole family loves this. It is now in my regular rotation. I don't use instant rice though. I cook the rice separately in chicken broth, using about a cup of rice. I mix it all together to simmer for about 10 minutes before serving. I also use taco seasoning on the chicken. I serve this with sour cream, tortilla chips and avocado if I have it.

Great recipe.  I added some thin slices of green pepper and onion, 1/2 can of corn and 1/2 can of black beans.  Also added a couple shakes of hot sauce.  I was perfect!

I Absolutely love this recipe. It's a good, quick weeknight meal for your family.  The only thing I changed is I use already cooked rotisserie chicken and green salsa verde (16 oz jar)   This time, since I'm  making this during the summertime I added fresh corn right off the cob.  Yummy!

This was very good, used my homemade salsa and increased the servings to 6 because we had an extra child.  However, they must have been big servings because we ended up with a fair amount of left overs.  Only thing I will change is that I will let the rice cook a bit and then stir it again before putting the cheese on the top.

Delicious!  I cut my chicken up and shook in a baggie with taco seasoning as others suggested.  I also baked my chicken instead of cooking it in the pan, just as a personal preference.

I made this with some minor changes, I seasoned the chicken in homemade taco seasoning I also sautéed a thinly sliced shallot with the chicken, I then added 1 cup uncooked long grain rice ( not instant) about half a jar of hot salsa, a can of chopped green chiles, and brought to a boil and reduced heat to low and simmered 20 minutes, then added cheese, it was delicious!

Everyone loved it.  I made it with instant once because I had a box given to me.  I decided I just hate instant rice.  I now precook rice (just in one of the cheap microwave cookers) while I cut and cook the chicken and such, and then throw the regular rice in at the end after the soup and salsa are boiling.  I also throw in a bunch of cheese into it then and stir it up so it melts throughout. It's just as quick and much better. Good comfort food.

The end result was pretty good. Some have advocated using "real" rice (e.g. non-instant rice). We tried that and it was difficult to get it to cook through, so I'll stick to the instant rice in the future.

This was pretty good.  I didn't use as much rice as it calls for.  I only used about 1-1/2 cups.  We also topped it with extra salsa at the table.  This makes great burritos from the leftovers.  Put a little salsa and cheese on a tortilla with the leftovers and roll up.  Zap in the mircrowave for a little bit and you have a great burrito!

I loved this!  I took the advice of the others and sprinkled taco seasoning on the chicken.  I also cooked chopped onion and minced fresh garlic with the chicken.  Next time, I will add black beans to the mix.  Yummy and easy!

My husband is VERY picky so when he likes something I always like to leave a review, and he liked this. I only did it slightly different. The only thing I measured was the rice and salsa everything else I just kind of tossed it in there. I didn't have chicken broth so I used chicken broth granuales and mixed w/1 cup of water. I used bone-in chicken and just cup it up before I cooked it. The last thing I did different was, I added sour cream. Not to all of it just a dollup in individual bowls.

I have made this time and time again. It is fast, easy, and delicious. I make a few modifications... I add half an onion, green pepper, and tomato diced to the chicken when it is just about done. Then I add the entire jar of salsa, not just what the recipe calls for. A can of black beans and some cumin finishes off the flavors.

Took away the rater's comments and woah, this dinner went over really well! Added more salsa, two tomatoes, a little water (since I used white rice, not instant), the Taco Seasoning I recipe seasonings and served in tortillas with sour cream, shredded cheddar and olives on top. A few bites and my husband said "Five Stars!" and "Make this again sometime!" Love that. Thanks.

This was good! I modified slightly because my chicken was cooked already.  Heated the broth, salsa and chic to boiling.  Added rice, topped with cheese.  My salsa had black beans and corn in it already, so I didn't feel the need to add anything else. Definitely worth repeating.

YUMMY!! I followed other reviewer's suggestions to add a pkg of taco seasoning to the chicken, added some frozen corn, used a 16oz jar of salsa, I used the full amount of cheese. The first night we ate this on a plate as is with a dollop of sour cream but it was amazing heated up the second and third night when we used it as a filling for toasted burritos!

Great recipe!  The whole family loved it including my one year old.  I used the suggestions and cooked the chicken with taco seasoning and used real rice (don't like the taste of instant).  I did still use the entire can of chicken broth and just boiled it down.  I also added black beans and corn.  Will certainly make again!

I made this once before and it was pretty good, though not quite the flavor I was looking for.  I made it over lunch today with a few changes.  I used a rotisserie chicken and a box of Spanish rice.  After shredding the chicken I threw it in with Spanish rice to cook.  I did add a little chopped jalapenos and about 1/2 cup of salsa.  It was so delicious and done in 15 minutes.

Great Mexican flavor. I actually used 1 c. rice and a package of Spanish rice because I didn't have enough rice but it turned out great.  Quick, easy and great flavor.

Very good!  I didn't have a large quantity of ingredients and my husband doesn't really care for Mexican style food so I halved the recipe.  I didn't have any instant rice so I used 1/2 cup of uncooked white rice.  I put that along with 1 cup of chicken broth and 1 cup of salsa and mixed it in an 8x8 baking dish.  I already had some grilled chicken so I chopped it up and threw it in as well.  I covered it in foil and baked it at 350 for 1 hour.  Then I put 4 oz of cheddar on top, put the foil back on and heated for 5 minutes.  This definitely wasn't the easy, quick way but man was it good!  I'm thinking of adding black beans next time as well as doing another suggestion, cooking fresh chicken with taco seasoning.  YUM, definitely a keeper!

Finally a good casserole that does not include a cream soup. The only change I made was to use brown rice ( our preference). The receipe is good as is or could be tweaked in many ways.

Oh. My. Gosh.  I made this dish for my boyfriend the other night because he likes spicy food and it was a HUGE hit.  Jeff couldn't stop raving about how great this dish tasted and even took the left-overs to work with him the next day.  After some hesitation (he didn't want to share) he had a co-worker try the dish and he loved it too.  Now I'm trading food for labor, as we needed some work done around the house and the co-worker said he'll do anything we need as long as I make the spicy rice and chicken for him! 10+ stars!!  P.S. I did coat the chicken pieces in taco seasoning as suggested by another reviewer and used Pace Picante HOT sauce as my salsa.  GREAT!

I love this recipe, cheap, easy, and yummy! The only change I made is less cheese and I add the cheese just a minute or two before serving. I have also made this without the chicken and it was a great meatless dinner.

This was so wonderful! This will be a new addition to our dinner menu; full of flavor!

After making again I thought I'd spice up the chicken a little bit. Cut into pieces and dip chicken into taco seasoning. Works great and gives it a great flavor. Eat it with sour cream also and it's like a mexican dish!

This was delicious! I was not sure how much flavour it would have, but it surprised me. I used a cup of brown and wild rice and cooked it before adding to the remainder of the ingredients. I also used one really large chicken breast with a little fahita spice added. It was a hit with the whole family.

This taste soooo GOOD!!! I did make some changes like other reviewers did.  Mixed my chicken with taco seasoning (like a dry rub)and added a small chopped onion. Also added a few pinches of chili powder & cumin..Dash of salt and pepper (not too much) Bigger jar of chunky salsa. Cooked rice and added it to mixture and let it cook a few..Then poured mixture in a casserole dish and added colby & monterey jack cheese on top. Baked until cheese was melted. My 13 year old is VERY VERY PICKY and she loved it...Hubby also loved it...Served it with sweet corn and sweet corn muffins..DELISH

I added a can of green chilies and it added some good spice.  I feel that it needed more chicken...I am going to do a 1.5 pounds next time.  Doubling the salsa really helped....I didn't like the salt and pepper.  I will season with taco seasoning next time.  Very easy!

So easy and so yummy!  I used vegetable broth in place of chicken and used regular brown rice in place of instant since that's what I had on hand.  Worked perfectly.  This is a very adaptable recipe.  Next time I might throw in some corn or green bell pepper for some added variety.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This dish is amazing, and is a complete hit at my table. Instead of stove top, I pour the whole thing into a cassarole dish, and then the cheese and bake it until the chesse melts...so good, and really yummy the next day warmed up..if there is any left!!

Great weeknight supper.  I made two changes, the first was the amount of cheese used, like some others, I only sprinkled on some to taste, not the full amount.  I also used a black bean and corn salsa (Paul Newman's) and added a can of rinsed black beans.  Adds a great taste and more fiber and protein!  We will certainly be eating this again!  thanks!!

This is simple and very good. I will be making it often, my whole family loved it! I loved that it only took about 30 minutes if that. I seasoned the chicken a little more and used brown instant rice instead of the while. Couldn't even tell the difference. Try this you won't be sorry!!!

Excellent! Very easy to make. I followed other's advice and doubled the salsa. I made it mild so my daughter would eat it but will get spicier salsa next time

Wow, I can't believe how easy, fast and tasty this recipe is. I boiled the chicken ahead of time and used the broth from that. My husband asked me if this was Paella, which gave me the idea to add shrimp and sausage next time. How delicious.

so easy to make, and my husband and daughter liked it very much. The only deviation I made from the menu was using regular long grain rice which I cooked ahead of time in broth and then added with the salsa (I don't use instant rice). A great easy on the cook dish. Thanks!

Hmmm...I made this with a little chili powder and added a small chopped green pepper and a small chopped red pepper. Served with chopped tomato and green onions, and a little dab of sour cream. After all of that, it still seemed to be missing something. We both decided that we prefer the Mexican Style Ground Beef from this site. We feel that it has more flavour. Thanks for the recipe, though!

Overall was very good. Doubled the recipe with the exception of the rice and was still too much. Added extra ortegas and freshed diced avacados on top YUM

SURPRISINGLY good!  I made this dish because I just happened to have all the ingredients on hand and I was blown away!  Super easy and quick and very tasty.    That being said, I think the quality of the Salsa will greatly effect this dish, so make sure you use something you would eat plain!  A few tiny changes: 1.  I only had chick stock cubes so used that instead of proper 'broth' 2.  Added Cumin (I love cumin!) 3.  In England 'instant' rice takes 10 minutes, so we left it on a low heat for 5 minutes and then let it stand for 5 minutes.  Next time:  we'll add more cheese, but at the very end and mix it into the entire dish, not on top.  Add this to your cooking repertoire... you won't be disappointed!

This was great. I used homemade salsa and I think it makes a huge difference in the taste. This was a big hit with the whole family. A definite keeper.

This was so good. It seems more like a side item than a main dish though. I was searching for main dishes when I found this. Oh well. It was ALL gone in the first round. :)

This was great!  I did make a few slight changed though... First, I addad some corn and chopped green pepper.  Then, used chicken bullion to make the broth-- Didn't have any.  And when I was cooking the chicken pieces, I added a little taco seasoning.  This dish was fabulous and I will be making it again!  Thanks for a great meal.  :)

Yum!  I needed a quick idea for some left-over chicken..this was fast and delicious.  I used a "Santa Fe" mild salsa and coated the chicken with half a package of taco seasoning as another reviewer suggested; (an excellent touch by the way).  I added a can of corn and topped it with shredded mozzarella and baby swiss cheese.  My husband hummed with every bite. Thank you!

This is a great base for a recipe, however I think it needs a lot more liquid. I used 16 oz of a chunky salsa and more broth. I also think it helps to put the rice in while everything is still boiling, then cover, then turn off the heat. I would then do the cheese after the rice is done. I used a mango apricot salsa from the local grocery store and a mix of shredded mozzarella/provolone. Will try regular salsa.  Tasty and very easy!

I make this recipe all of the time, and it's great! I add hot sauce when I'm cooking the chicken and make it with mozarella cheese instead of cheddar; either way, it's definitely a favorite!

I used 1.5 cups rice/chicken broth instead of the 2 cups and put in some drained and rinsed black beans. I didn't measure how much cheese I used but it wasn't the whole amount, just threw some on top. Served with sour cream. This was wonderful!

Delicious and rather easy to make.  I cooked the cut up chicken with some garlic and onion and added a little chopped cilantro while cooking the rice.  It went great in burritos with a bit of sour cream.  I'll definitely be making this one again.

I made this last night and was a little skeptical because of the mixed reviews, but I loved it. All I did was not add the salt, but I thought it was full of flavor and and didn't feel the need to add a tortilla.

Very quick and easy! I did however only use about 4oz cheese instead of the 8 oz and it was plenty cheesy. This was also  good for left over's hot or cold w/ tortilla chips.

5 stars! I will definately make this again. The calories aren't too bad if you use brown rice and stick to the portion size. mmmm!

Good as a filling for tacos, but not much by itself.  I was pretty disappointed by this one, but looking at the ingredients I don't know what I really expected.

This was pretty good :-).  And super fast too.  Can't beat that when you've got 4 kids ages 5 & under!  It's really good w/ tortilla chips too.  Adding a sprinkling of onion powder, garlic powder, & chili powder w/ the salt & pepper are the only changes that I made.  I will definitely make again but will try to cut down the sodium by not sprinkling the salt on the chicken & possibly using a low-sodium broth.  I found myself drinking a lot of water as I stuffed my face ;-).

This chicken was so moist because of the chicken broth. I also added a package of taco seasoning to give it more flavor and made with brown rice and reduced fat cheese to make it more healthy. My husband and I loved it!

I have been making this for years. My husband has always loved the leftovers because this dish becomes even more flavorful the next day. I have even put some in a tortilla with beans the next day to vary it.

I followed the recipe exactly, except using less cheese. I agree with other reviewers on too much rice. I used a medium salsa, but still didn't give me enough flavor. Rated 4*'s as DH & DS devoured it! Would also be good with a warm tortilla wrapped around it!

I thought that this was a great quick meal for the family.  For the salsa, I used salsa and rotel.  I only used 1 cup of rice and also added just a bit of taco seasoning and it was perfect mixture.

One word to describe this recipe: YUMMY!!I've prepared this recipe on three different occasions because my girlfriend keeps asking me to cook it for her.  My best friend also found it amazing. I've always added more chicken in order to make it 'meatier'.  Next time, I will replace the chicken with hot Italian sausage just to give it a try.

The only salsa I had was a little hot, but I think this would have been great with a mild salsa. The recipe is just a little different from the norm and was a nice change.

This was awesome!  I make a lot of meals ahead of time to freeze.  This one, I made everything except the rice and froze it.  Then when we were ready to eat it, I heated it up in a pan on the stove, and added instant rice.  It was ready in just a few minutes!

I just made this tonight for my husband and I. I thought it was really good. My husband thought it was ok. He isn't really a salsa person, so that's probably why. He did say that he would eat it again. As far as preparation, it was sooo easy to make. Took me like 20 maybe 30 minutes total from start to finish. The recipes says that it only takes 5 minutes for the rice to cook, but my rice was still crunchy after five minutes. I left it on the stove 5 minutes more and it was perfect! I will probably make this again!

We made this by grilling chicken thighs with a little bit of olive oil and jamaican jerk seasoning and adding it to the rice mixture.  We used Newman's pineapple salsa and ended up making a second batch.

Great, easy recipe!  I make a week's worth of lunches every week for work, and this was quick and simple.  I added some leftover green peppers I chopped up from making stuffed peppers the week before and it was a nice touch.  You could even add a can of green chilis for some extra zest instead of the peppers.  After it was all cooked and combined, I added some sour cream...delicious!  Ended up a bit dry, that's why the add-in of the sour cream when served.

We found this recipe over a year ago and it is still my favorite thing to make.  I change it up every once in a while now by adding different spices to the chicken, but other than that this recipe is awesome!  Thank you for adding this recipe here!!!

My husband really liked this, but myself and my 2 sons didn't.  It was kinda bland for my tastes; needs some additional spices in my opinion.  I won't be making this again.

We loved it! I didn't have salsa, so I used Pace Picante Sauce, the green chilles made a great kick!  When I presented it to my husband, he told me he is not fond of salsa and rice, but when he tried it, he asked for more!  I changed it by adding chopped onions and chopped tomates, since I wasn't using salsa.  And I only used 1/4 of the recommended cheese.  It made for an awesome burrito filling the next day!

My husband and I loved this dish.  I sauteed yellow onion with the chicken and added green pepper to the chicken when it was half done.  I didn't have instant rice so I cooked rice seperately and then added it once the salsa and chicken broth were boiling. To ensure that the flavors infused into the rice I let it simmer on med-low for a few minutes before adding the cheese.  So Yummy!!!

This was really good!  I threw in a can of black beans (drained) and instead of cooking the rice with the dish, I just poured it over white rice.  Nice recipe.

SO simple and yummy. I used Olive Oil Pam instead of regular Olive Oil and a little less cheese.  Instant Rice = Uncooked Rice, make sure it's fully covered by the liquid.  I think it woudl be good burrito or taco stuffing too.

A yummy, quick recipe.  I would recommend using medium salsa to give the recipe some kick.  I also added in a pinch of red pepper and adobo seasoning.

Loved the recipe.  Easy and Delicious.  I use brown rice so that took a little longer to cook, but after that the ingredients went together quickly.  I also threw in a can of black beans (rinsed).  Got rave reviews from my husband.

I was pretty disappointed with this dish. It was really just a filling for a burrito rather than a meal that stands on its own. It tasted good, but I couln't have imagined serving it without it stuffed in a taco shell.

I made this last sunday for lunch, it was great! I made a few changes: I didn't have instant rice, so I cooked 1 cup of jasmine rice in the microwave in 2 cups of canned chicken broth.  While that was cooking, I browned 4 chicken tenderloins, that I had diced, in olive oil, then added 3 crushed garlic cloves.  I added the rice to the chicken, poured 1/2 cup of broth, added salsa, then simmered on low.  I used mozzerella cheese, I didn't have any cheddar on hand, and though the flavor was mild, it was still very good, hubby loved it! Will make againa and again, thanks!

I thought this was a very good recipe - quick, easy and diet friendly when I used fat free cheese.  I omitted the chicken broth and cooked brown rice separately, then mixed together to serve.  We rolled the leftovers in fat free flour tortillas and loved those too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Bit disappointed because I usually like this type of dish better.  It was pretty decent, but nothing spectacular.  And frankly, if I have to "jazz it up" as everyone has suggested, then I believe it's everyone else's recipe, and I'm rating *this* one.  I didn't think it was too much rice though. :-)  I'd probably make it again but not often.

This was delicious for what it is; a quick simple meal. Based on other reviews I cut the rice. I only used 1 c, but the mixture came out too soupy, so I would suggest 1 1/2 c. Great with a side of guacamole and tortilla.

This recipe was very easy to make and fulfilling enough that my whole family enjoyed it.  You could add several items to jazz it up like others have mentioned.  I sliced up an avocado and added it on top right before serving.  Let people add a dollop of sour cream, too, if desired.  Yum!

I was SO surprised by this recipe! It was delicious! I used Instant brown rice, and for some reason, it took a lot longer to cook. I also used double the salsa and half the cheese.  I served it as a dip (casserole consistency) with tortilla chips! Yum! I will definitely make again.

Yummy!  When I added the broth and salsa I also added 1 cup corn and 1 cup black beans and then brought to boil.  Also used 1 1/2 c. salsa.  I then put in only 1 1/2 c. rice and put the cheese on top.....when I checked it about 10 minutes later it was still thin, so I added the other 1/2 c. rice and just stirred the cheese in.  I simmered it uncovered until it got to the right consistency.  My hubby loved it and so did I!  Also, my salsa was HOT, and it made the dish great!

Wouldn't make it all the time, but very good if you want something a little different.
