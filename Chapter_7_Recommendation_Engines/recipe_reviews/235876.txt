Only made half a recipe.  Wish I had made more!  Only had regular rum which worked fine.  Next time I think I'll peel the apples.  I served it along side a breakfast casserole Christmas morning.  Everyone loved it.

Made for a wonderful quick dessert. Made the recipe as written.  Will make again.  Served with some ice cream and a splash of rum on top. Worked really well cooking on top of the wood stove and made the house smell delicious.

I enjoyed this  immensely , I needed a good recipe for some applesauce and so I made this and cooled it in the fridge . After it was cool I took some and blended and this minced up some of the other and added it to the blended. It worked out great for a muffin recipe I was creating... AWESOME..thanks??

Absolutely a drunken apples replica!  I added a little more sugar and cinnamon.  These are great!  Should have made a double batch.  My husband went through them quickly!

I doubled the run and cinnamon, added a tablespoon of butter and drizzled the dish with caramel sauce. It was totally delicious, and so easy that I'm already planning he next time I make it.

Yumm!!! Very good as is, I used coconut rum and fresh grated nutmeg. Next time I'll cut the sugar back and use half brown sugar instead of white.
