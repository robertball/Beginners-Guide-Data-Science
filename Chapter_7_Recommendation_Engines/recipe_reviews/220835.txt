This quiche is delicious!  I had one piece, and DH and DS devoured the rest.  I wish I had been able to find morels, but since I couldn't, I used regular button mushrooms.  My only other deviation from the recipe was to use 6 green onions, with tops, for the chopped onion.  Excellent!  Sorry, my picture doesn't do it justice.

Only change I made was mixed mushrooms and an additional egg.

This recipe is to die for! I did not have any regular ham so I used cooked, smoked ham from Presidents' Choice. Morels are hard to find, but I will definitely make it again, even if I have to use a different type of mushroom.

I used this recipe as a base for my quiche. I followed the ratios of the egg mixture and added my own toppings; bacon and sweet peppers. The eggs in this are nice and fluffy; which I have not found as much of in other recipes.
