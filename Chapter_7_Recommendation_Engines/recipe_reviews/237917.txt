Way too much liquid, even though I decreased the water to 1 cup as one reviewer suggested.  Flavor was good. Texture was good.  Just too much liquid. I will make this again with some revisions, either less water, or one less can on tomato sauce.

Love this recipe! I will never eat ground beef tacos again! I am not a vegetarian or vegan but my son is and that's how I came across this recipe. It's super easy, tasty and I love that it's so healthy for me.

I'm vegan and my family is not. But everyone loved it. Would definitely make it again.  I also took tips from other reviews and lowered the amount of water.

I make this all the time. It's easy and delish. I put a bit less water and smash up the black beans some to more closely mimic taco filling, but otherwise- perfection!

Thought it was really good, will make again. I agree with other reviewers that the amount of water should be decreased.

It was very good. Everybody enjoyed it. It had a nice heavy feel to it, which I value in a meat-substitute.

I made this for my company's veggie taco bar, and it was such a big hit! Everyone that tried it loved it, and I had many requests for the recipe. Very easy to make and worth the time to make it!

Very yummy for a quick vegan meal (for someone who lives with all non-vegans).  I cut the recipe in half and still had plenty of leftovers, and it's very filling.  Cut down on the water as suggested.  Served on a large flour tortilla with vegan sour cream, nutritional yeast, and lettuce.  Will be sharing recipe and making again!

So good I was insisting my friends come over and try some. Next time I make it, I'll make sure I have some cotija cheese as a garnish. It didn't work so well as a soft taco filling, though. The tortillas apart around it within a minute and, actually, made it much blander. I'd serve it straight without a shell or tortilla at all.

Excellent alternative to beef! I've made this twice and received very positive feedback from both Vegetarians n Beefeaters.  Both times it was a bit too runny to use in taco shells so if you plan to this, I would cut the water down to 1 cup rather than 1 1/12 cups or give it much more time to cook down.

This is an awesome dish that adults and children  both can enjoy. I threw in some bell peppers to give it more of a crunch.

This is a really good place to start, it i simple enough that you can change it up to suit your tastes. I didn't exactly stick to the vegan guideline as I used chicken broth to cook the quinoa. It still fit the bill for meatless Monday. Like an idgit I forgot to check and see if there were any canned black beans in the house so I had to use re-fried beans and I only had burrito tortillas. Everything still worked out and the burritos were delicious.
