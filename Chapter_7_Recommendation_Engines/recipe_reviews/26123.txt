I found these cookies to be very cakey and they did not brown on top or spread very well.

A very good cookie and easy to make.  It wasn't as chewy as I had hoped so next time I will use a little less flour.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I recalculated the recipe in order to make 36 cookies, so that may have altered the outcome.  The flavor of the cookie is great (might use a little bit more sugar next time though) but the texture is a little weird.  It's more like a cake than a cookie.  Very spongy....also, the "cookies" didn't flatten out at all on the cookie sheet.  Other than that, they're great though!
