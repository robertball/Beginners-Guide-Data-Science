Perfect! A super healthy alternative to traditional fried rice without all the carbs! This fits nicely into my healthy lifestyle. It's a little time-consuming, but it's so worth it. I cut the cauliflower into florets and was easily able to "rice" it in my Ninja blender pitcher in a matter of seconds. Super easy! Next time I'll definitely use much more red pepper flakes and poblano because this wasn't spicy at all for my tastes. Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

This is wonderful! I halved the recipe for 2 people. Plenty! The only changes I made were to use honey instead of brown sugar (out of it) in the sauce, and I subbed in kale and peas for the veggies (what I had on hand in the freezer). I also sautéed some shrimp marinated in a bit of granulated garlic, salt, & paprika and cooked very quickly in olive oil & mixed in the shrimp at the end. Outstanding dish! Thanks for sharing! This is a keeper.

Very good!  I don’t even like cauliflower, but I had to try this.  The seasonings and other ingredients mask the taste well.   Now I have one more way to get more veggies in my diet.  I used what I had on hand:  leftover teriyaki pork tenderloin, carrots, green onions, frozen peas.  I only used half the cauliflower but kept the other things the same.  I didn’t have a chili pepper so I just used a bigger pinch of red pepper flakes.  I will make this again.  
PS:  my husband couldn’t guess what the “secret” ingredient was.  He really thought it was rice.

I loved this recipe. I used shrimp instead of pork and I added snap peas. It was delicious and very filling. I will definitely make this again.

It was decent. My teenagers ate it. Nothing special about it. Next time I will make it with shrimp.

So good!  My husband is not a fan of cauliflower, but he said it was the best cauliflower he had ever eaten. This recipe has great flavor and was such a good swap for regular fried rice.

I made this tonight and it did not look anything like the picture but it tasted amazing.  Even my kids liked it, which is saying a lot.  Easy way to get the kids to eat vegetables.  I will make this again.  May even trying stuffing it in bell peppers and baking next time.  It did take a little more effort/time than I budgeted for.  Great recipe.

Quick, easy, healthy, and really good!  I didn't find this to be at all spicy (hot).  I added a little chicken broth at the end to keep it from being dry.

I've made this twice now. The first time I doubled the sauce. The second I made it as suggested. Doubled had more flavor but was juicier. Also, thie second rime i added sugar snap peas for more crunch and vegetables. I can hardly believe I'm eating mostly vegetables with this. It is so good and good for you!

lacked flavor.  A lot of work for little enjoyment.

This was an amazing dish. Recipe easy to follow and simple to make. Thought that it would be very tasting with some shrimp added

Yum!  Came out well. You'll want to prep all ingredients before you start cooking for ease of cooking.
