Served this to my bridge club and we decided that if you add cooked chicken makes a great luncheon or light evening meal.

It certainly was missing something.  The avocado certainly overpowered the stuffing.   It needed more zing - some rice wine vinegar, perhaps, garlic, a sprinkling of pepper flakes, something.  The stuffing "complimented" the avocado (dried fruits, vinaigrette...) but there was no contrast.  The textures were spot on, however.

This is a delicious and healthy salad.  I diced the avocado and added it right in.  I will make this often.

yummy... but one really needs to make sure the avacado is ripe. This recipe was well recieved at a dinner party... but lots of people left the avacado.
