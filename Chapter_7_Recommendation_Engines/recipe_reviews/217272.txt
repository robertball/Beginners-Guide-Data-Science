I noticed some of the reviewers thought this was bland, so, I thought I would adjust the seasonings to be more flavorful.  I used 4 chicken breasts instead of 6.   I doubled all components of the rub except for the salt.  I kept it at the same measurement.   I heavily sprinkled the chicken breasts with the rub.   I also sauteed the mushrooms in a little butter until they were golden brown before adding to the crock pot.  This adds additional flavor.   I did not add the sour cream at first because I did not want it to curdle or clump.  I mixed the soup, chardonnay,  mushrooms and covered the chicken.  I cooked for 3 hours in the sauce.  I then removed the chicken breasts and whisked the sour cream into the sauce until fully incorporated.  I then added the chicken breasts back into the sauce and cooked for an additional hour.   Boneless chicken breasts definitely do not need 8 hours to cook or they will be dry.  The sauce was thick and very flavorful.  The chicken was moist and delicious.   I served with Jasmine rice and broccoli.  Very simple to make and tasty!   I'll definitely make again.

This has always been a favorite of mine!  The recipe calls for the wine, sour cream, mushroom soup and mushrooms to be added together and poured on chicken to cook.  I, personally, wait till the last half hour to add the sour cream.  Yum

tastes great. I added a teaspoon of minced garlic. I love garlic. Doesn't need extra.

YUM!  Absolutely delicious. My husband emphasized I needed to keep track of this recipe for future use. :) And said it would be great for when we have company.  The only thing I did differently was I didn't make it in the slow-cooker.

I browned the chicken in a saucepan with some olive oil, butter (just a bit of each) and garlic, as well as the spices mentioned. Then I removed the chicken to a glass pan and put it in the oven at 350. Then I sauteed the mushrooms in the same pan (more garlic and a bit more butter), then added the liquids. I let this simmer on low for about 15-20 minutes while the chicken cooked in the oven. Then, I transferred the sauce onto the chicken and let it cook another 25 minutes or so in the oven.   I served it on a bed of rice, with a side of roasted asparagus. YUM YUM YUM!  The wine's definitely the key ingredient.

This recipe is so delicious. Tweaked it a bit, adding the sour cream in the last hour which was suggested by another. As well as shredding the chicken and putting it back into the sauce for the last hour.

It was pretty good but it could have used more sauce. I think next time I'll double the sauce ingredients.

This was the first crock pot recipe I tried. Added potatoes to it to make it a full meal. Next time I might try different spices because it tasted a bit bland to me.

I'd call this chicken stroganoff! I really liked it, as written, and so did the family. I figured that the chicken was going to be shredded since it cooked so long, so it wasn't the most visually pleasing dish! I served over egg noodles, and it was a delicious, hearty meal. I was able to get six 1 cup servings out of the recipe. Will make again!

Not sure what or if I did something wrong but I thought I followed recipe exactly and did not care for it at all.  Chicken was dry and tasteless, sauce was bland and somewhat curdled.   (Apologies to author -- it may just be my taste.)

This was just ok.  The chicken breasts stayed together well but were dry even in all that sauce and overcooked in 6 hrs. Was a touch bland for my tastes. Only substitution was soaked shiitake mushrooms for fresh.  Served with egg noodles that went well with the sauce.

Unfortunately I had no fresh mushrooms which would have been a great addition. I also did not have 8 hours, so I just panned seared the chicken in olive oil then simmered in the sauce for about 40 minutes. I added about half of the sour cream the recipe called for and put fresh garlic. Even with my tweaks, it was delicious! Next time I will be trying this in the slow cooker and I have a feeling it will be amazing.

I thought this dish was great and so did my family. The chicken was so juicy and not dry at all, I used 5 boneless skinless breasts and cooked on low for 10 hours (the whole time we were at work). The only changes I made was adding extra spices, not adding the sour cream until I got home which was right before we ate and partially shreaded the chicken.  I served with wild rice and artichokes...it was a Great dinner that I will make again.

It was great,  I also changed some things, adding sour cream at end so it was more creamy. I definitely will make it again.

This was delish!  I fixed it as the states, but I cooked a cup of rice then about 5 minutes before serving, mixed it into the pot.  It thickened up real well.  a definite keeper.

Wow.. this is a recipe from the past!  I have made this for probably 35 years.  Almost identical recipe came with my old crock pot and it was called Parisian Chicken and we love it!  Thanks for the reminder, I'm going to try this recipe.

I didn't use the lemon pepper or wine and added a few chilli flakes and onions. It's really tasty with rice and sweet potato.

My husband and I enjoyed the flavor. I followed the diretions with the amount of spices but didn't have any white wine and used water instead as well as used thigh instead of breast, it was on sale when I went shopping. Overall good flavor and went well over rice.

Definitely hold the sour cream until last or it curdles. Wine gives it a great flavor. A great, tasty dish.

The chicken with the rub is definitely not bland. I took the advice of other reviewers and sauteed the mushrooms in a little butter before adding to the pot and I added the sour cream 30 minutes before serving.  I also cut the chicken into bite size pieces and put back in the pot after adding the sour cream.  My family really liked it.  I will definitely be making this again. I had 2 lbs. chicken breast that I cut horizontally across before adding the rub so my breast were thinner and it only took like 3 1/2 hours total to cook.  The last half hour I turned it up to high.  Served over slightly buttered Jasmine rice.  I did double the sauce which does make a lot. Unless you really want a lot of sauce I wouldn't recommend it.  Because I doubled the sauce I also doubled the mushrooms. The next day I grilled up some more chicken with the same rub and added to the sauce and served for dinner again.  It was very tasty. Thanks wx2computers for sharing a simple and easy but great recipe.  UPDATE:  The next time we made this my husband threw some of the leftover spice set from the rub (he made a little extra) into the finished sauce and stirred it all together.  The extra spices added even more delicious flavor to this dish.

This isn't the prettiest dinner I've ever served, but it does taste great.  Next time I'll wait to add the sour cream so the sauce doesn't look so split.  I didn't have any lemon-pepper so I added the juice of a lemon just before serving.  Very easy and tastes great:  will definitely make again!

It sounded so good, but turned out so bad!  Watery, overcooked, boiled chicken with curdled sour cream after only 4 hours on Low.  I sure wish I had read some of the reviews and tweaked the recipe before trying it as written.  What a disappointment.

This recipe was easy but it lacked flavor, even though I added a larger amount of spices than the recipe called for. My husband asked whether I'd boiled the chicken because to him it didn't have the taste of chicken. I agree. I cooked it in the slow cooker for 6 hours on low and added the sour cream an hour before serving it over buttered noodles. The chicken was moist, but the dish was nothing special. Sorry, but I won't be making this again.

3.5  Tasted good, too watery and I guess I should have added the sour cream at the end but I wasn't home as everything looked curdled.  Nope, had such high hopes for it................

This was very tasty.  I read some of the reviews beforehand and I too waited until the last hour before adding the sour cream.  The wine was also a nice touch.  My friend went back for seconds.  It was a hit.

Definitely double up on the spices amounts, and like others have suggested, sour cream goes in 30-60 minutes at the end. I marinated mine overnight so I let it cook a long time on low, about 6 or 7 hours and it still came out very juicy.

Tasted great.  Converted it to stove top and oven, though. Next time added garlic to the recipe,  tasted even better.

I followed this simple and delicious recipe except that I made my own cream of mushroom soup from a recipe I found on Pinterest and I cooked it for 30-40 minutes, covered at 350F. It was not at all bland- tasty and delicious!!! Try it with a homemade soup recipe to avoid the MSG, sodium and other questionable ingredients- just butter, flour, milk, mushrooms and garlic* and onion* (*optional) for a healthier option.

I butterflied and flattened each breast adding salt and garlic  then browned.  Removed from skillet (keeping warm) and combined all the rest of the ingredients into the skillet and whipped well over medium heat.  Added chicken back to the skillet and cooked on medium for 15min. Served over white rice.  Thanks for this it is wonderful.

I made it twice so far, but not with the mushrooms, since no on in my family likes it. I used 1.5 lbs of chicken. Everyone loved it!

This was delicious. I did omit the sour cream and doubled up on the cream of mushroom and wine. It was great because I had 1lb of leftover diced up cooked chicken I was going to use to make a mexican dish but wanted something else. This was perfect and easy. I also added extra garlic.

This was a quick prep and a tasty, simple meal for summer slow cooking.  I followed the recipe closely on the chicken seasoning, but thought the sauce needed a little doctoring so I added some lemon pepper, lemon juice , worchestershire sauce and salt.  Served over kluski noodles.  Sincere thanks for sharing your recipe.

I cooked it for 4 hours on low and then shredded the chicken and put it back into the crock pot and shut it off.  It came out perfect.  The sauce was wonderful served over rice.  This is a great meal for any busy family.

Tasty, but I admit I made a lot of changes. I used frozen chicken breasts, put them in the crock pot first, then topped with sliced mushrooms. Then I mixed the rest of the ingredients together and poured it over the top. I swapped out the sour cream for fat free plain yogurt, used healthy soup to cut some calories, and doubled the spices (except for the salt). Easy and healthy dinner.

This is going to be the new favorite at our house! Easy to put together and put in a crock-pot! This would be a wonderful meal for an evening at home with friends. It did cook faster than noted. However, I think it might depend on the cooks' type of cooker. I followed someone's suggestion and floured and browned the chicken. Also, added chopped onions and garlic. I don't do many reviews but this one was so good I just had to share!

I just made this recipe tonight for the first time. My teen son inhaled 2 plates. I'd call out a success! I didn't add any wine in mine but it turned out well without it. It's a keeper.

Based on feedback and a distant memory of something similar from my childhood, I made a number of changes.  I used 2 huge chicken breasts that I split in half lengthwise.  I used a can of cream of mushroom, a can of cream of chicken, 3 cups of sliced white mushrooms sauteed in butter and canola, one diced yellow onion sauteed in canola oil, salt and pepper on both and increased the wine to 3/4 cup.  I also added 2 tsp fresh thyme leaves and the seasoning for the chicken was rubbed in garlic powder, Johnny's seasoning salt and fresh ground pepper.  As others have mentioned cooking time was drastically shorter and I didn't add the sour cream until the last 1/2 hour.  I served it with white rice steamed in chicken broth with butter and fresh steamed broccoli.  Very popular at my house.

I did not care for this recipe. The chicken was very bland. I will use the chicken to make sour cream enchiladas tomorrow. Will not make this recipe again.

This recipe was great. I got the small can of Campbell's cream of mushroom w/reduced sodium. Didn't use sour cream and used chicken thighs. I doubled up all the spices except salt like the other reviewer recommended. I pan fried the chicken on both sides in garlic (30 seconds each side) along with half of the dry rub and then put it in slow cooker for 2 hours. Found the sauce too thin so added 2 tablespoons of all purpose flour to thicken it. My slow cooker goes to warm mode after the timer goes off so not sure if that's what made the sauce thin.

I served it with pasta and it was great. I have enough sauce remaining for another dinner so I've frozen it till the next time.
