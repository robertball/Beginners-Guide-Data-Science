Yummy!  Good holiday cake. I made it as is, and also as a bundt cake with a jigger of brandy added and glazed it with melted hard sauce.

This was a lovely,easy cake to make. I used my homemade green tomato mincemeat instead of the commercial mincemeat. Instead of a 2 layer cake I baked in a bundt pan and drizzled the frosting over the top to run down the sides. Everyone really enjoyed it and said I could make this one again!

I am always looking for mincemeat recipes.  I love the boxed mincemeat because there is no HFCS.  This is a great recipe.  Add this ti my holiday rotation of sweets.  I made an applesauce glaze for this  cake instead of the caramel frosting.  a citrus glaze would be nice as well. Thanks

Excellent cake and not just for the holidays. I used my own mincemeat and followed the recipe, which I baked in a bundt pan.  I made my own caramel icing but made it as a glaze.  The cake is beautifully moist and tender and delicious.  I doubled the recipe to serve 25 people today and they all raved about it.

What a wonderful cake!  My only problem was with the frosting; I'm unfamiliar with caramelizing sugar, and although I succeeded in getting it to turn "golden," getting it out of the pan into the sugar/butter/cream mixture was a challenge.  I ended up spilling a small amount of the hot mixture into the stuck caramel and stirring like crazy to loosen and dissolve it - it worked, but I was nervous about burning the OTHER mixture while working it free.  The end result was worth it, though - a perfectly spiced cake with a lovely golden frosting that looked quite festive with my red & green sprinkle white chocolate nonpareils.  Thanks, Barbara!
