My family loved this recipe, even my son who usually only eats chocolate chip and doesn't like pineapple.

I used coconut instead of the almonds. Everyone liked them. They are a very chewy cookie, like eating a granola bar.

A nice and light cookie however no one else in my family cared for them so I probably will not be making again. Made with whole wheat pastry flour and omitted the salt.

I did not like this cookie and will not make them again. I love pineapples, raisins and nuts and could not wait to try this recipe. I was disappointed. The pineapples didn't seem to blend well with cinnamon and left the cookies tasting a bit bland to me. Also it is not a sweet cookie. I make some with coconut instead of raisins and some with the raisins. I didn't like them either way. The previous two ratings were 5 stars, just goes to show that we all have different tastes.
