Really excellent! Once everything was chopped, this came together very quickly. Was out of time to do the Crock-Pot version so just simmered it on the stove for an hour. Didn't have a jalapeno so used a can of diced tomatoes with jalapenos and onions. Used 6 boneless thighs instead of 4 bone-in. Flavor and heat was wonderful! Just to add a touch of brightness and pop of complementary flavor, we sprinkled chopped cilantro on top of each serving. Served over rice and it was amazing!! I want to try it with andouille sausage next time! Thanks for posting!

I made this dish tonight and turned out so good. My husband could not get enough of it. My step son who doesn't like a lot of veggies in this dish loved it. I followed the recipe exactly the way it's instructed. Definitely will be making this again!!!

Not bad. Definitely not like from back home in Louisiana, but still good in it's on right. Double up on the chicken though and shred it instead of cutting it up.

Slow Cooked Chicken & Sausage Gumbo Haiku: "Celery still crunchy. And roux more than ten minutes. But yum! We loved this." Full disclosure: I followed the recipe except I used a can of Kirkland chicken instead of the chicken thighs and a chicken Andouille sausage instead of Italian sausage. Didn't substitute anything else though, and we ate ours over faux-rice (food processor'ed cauliflower) with a baguette, you know, to appeal to starch-happy children, who it turns out, didn't mind that there was some heat in this gumbo. A pleasant tickle heat in the back of your throat, not reach-for-your-drink fire. If it wasn't for the celery (that I should've known better and sauteed first) being a bit al dente, and the roux taking more like 25 min. to develop that nice nutty color and aroma, I would've given this 5 stars.

I didn’t have time for the 1/2 hour prep work so dumped everything into the crockpot from the get go, frozen chicken, sausages, broth and all. I didn’t see the need to precook chicken that will be cooking in a crockpot for 6 hours!  Only change were andouille sausage instead of Italian, and mushrooms that needed to be used up.  Instead of the roux I had some flour I previously cooked in a cast iron pan in the oven for an hour, stirring every 15 minutes, then stored.  Same nutty deliciousness but less fat and effort.  Turned out great!

I used breasts instead of thighs, spicy sausage and shrimp. It turned out perfect!! I will definitely continue to use this recipe.

Omgoodness! This is so good. I followed the exact recipe but added a serranto along with jalapeño and everyone loved it. I will definitely make it again.

This was fantastic!  I made it last week and my family raved.  They told me so many times about how great it was that it got embarrassing!   Today I'm making it again and planning on putting it in individual sized containers for my husband to take to work for lunch.
   I added fresh okra.
