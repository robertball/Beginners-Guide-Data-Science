It's delicious. I didn't change any ingredients. However, I highly recommend roasting it at 325F for 80-90mins. This will make it incredibly tender! It literally melted in my mouth. If you're concerned about too much salt, I would reduce the amount of chili paste and/or soy sauce. You MUST use light soy sauce, otherwise the regular soy sauce is too salty. Another way to modify the saltiness is to keep the salt content but increase the brown sugar content. At the end of roasting, the marinade was greatly reduced. You can put the marinade in a pan on the stovetop, whisk in some flour or corn starch, add hydrated mushrooms (I use shiitake but buttons or creminis would work too) to make a gravy. Absolutely delicious!!! Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

Fantastic marinade. I used 1/4 soy sauce and also cooked it longer at lower temp to be more tender per other reviewers. Fresh chopped ginger puts this great marinate over the top! I bought some of those cheap ramen noodle packages and used the noodles in them stir fried with boy choy, mushrooms and celery tossed with some peanut oil, chicken broth, and a bit of the marinade sauce. Was SO GOOD!

Very tender and delicious. I added fresh ginger and cut down slightly on the sesame oil (as others suggested). I also did not have chili paste on hand so I used Asian chili sauce instead. Still quite spicy. The marinade smelled wonderful. I baked at 400 degrees instead of 450 and the marinade didn't burn in the pan at all. I will definitely make this again and again. Thank you!

Absolutely sensational.  This is the best pork dish I have ever tried. I made it almost exactly as written, although I marinated it for 20 hours.  Unlike some other writers,  I think that the sesame oil and Asian chili sauce are absolutely essential.  For the chili sauce, I used Guilin Chili Sauce by Lee Kum Lee, which you can buy at an Asian grocery.  It's as authentic as the sauces that I used while living in China.  I am puzzled, however, over the 25-30 minute cooking time for a 2lb. pork roast.  After 30 minutes, the pork was only at 120 degrees.  Even at the recommended 450, it took far longer to get it close to 160.  I wanted it barely done, because I dislike well done pork; 50 minutes did the job.  I covered the pork for the first 15-20 minutes and left it uncovered for the remainder of the time.;  Next time, I'll add grated ginger, although it was delicious without it.  Another nice addition is a sauce that in Japan is known simply as "Sauce."  The closest that I have found here is Bull-Dog Vegetable and Fruit Sauce (semi-sweet), also available at Asian grocery stores.  It's a good Worcestershire sauce substitute (I used some of this sauce in place of part of the Worcestershire).

Excellent! My husband and I really enjoyed this. I enjoyed how easy it was. I didn't want to buy Chili Paste since I don't like spicy and wasn't sure how spicy it would be so I used some Chili Powder instead about 1 teaspoon. I also started late on marinating so it marinated for 6 hours and I used both tenderloins and marinated in a resealable bag. It was plenty of marinade. I did use the leftover marinade, heated it up on the stove and added about a 1/2 T cornstarch to thicken it. I noticed a few reviews mentioned how the marinade burned on the foiled pan, I don't know if you poured all the marinade onto the pork on the pan, I just took the pork out and put on a lined foiled pan sprayed with cooking spray. This worked out fine, the pork didn't stick and the cleanup was easy since I tossed the foil.

A recipe with great potentials.  The flavors were great but I think next time I'll bake it at a very low temperature for at least 2 hours so the meat can be tender.  At 450F for 30min, although the internal temp registered high enough, the meat was not soft enough.

I halved the sesame oil and added some fresh ginger as well.  I tried it with tenderloin at 350F for about 50min and it came out very juicy.  I did a loin at 400 for 1hr30min and that worked well too.  I doubled the chile paste and it still had a great balance between the sweet and spicy.  I am thinking of trying out a squeeze or two of lime juice next time.

Oh Boy, Oh Boy, Oh Boy!!!  As another reviewer said "Onlicious" indeed.  This is a 10!!!  Didn't change a thing with the marinade and I won't in the future.  Perfect!!!  I used bonless pork chops and then broiled them.  If you sprinkle the chops with paprika you will get that charred BBQ look and  taste! The next time I will make rice with it and use that marinade as a sauce since we do like HOT.  As another reviewer said - the chops do not get overly spicey - just simply delicious and moist!!

Wow, this sure was good. My husband kept saying how much he was enjoying it as he was eating. I marinated the meat for about 12 hours and reduced the sesame oil to a tablespoon. Thanks for the great recipe!

Asian Pork Tenderloin Haiku: "Dinner pork success! (But lower temp for longer.) Ate the whole darn thing!" My tenderloin was a little over a pound for 3 of us, so I reduced the marinade (which I followed in ingredients and ratios to a T), and left it in the fridge for more than over-night. I think it's necessary to bake/roast such a piece of pork at a lower temp for a longer time, for that melted, fork-tender goodness, so I went w/ 325 deg. for about an hr. The flavor was very, very rich and deep, so my suggestion is pairing it w/ light veggies and rice, not too terribly seasoned. Extremely good, and all the better to see my pre-schooler devour her's in a wink.

Very flavorful and easy dish.  I adjusted the ingredients based on the reviews I read and to suit our taste.  I mixed the 1/3 cup with half soy and half worcerstershire sauce to cut down on saltiness.   I use 1/8 cup sesame oil and 1/8 cup vegetable oil.  I added 2 tsps of fresh ginger & used Sriracha chili sauce since I couldn't find the paste.  It definitely kicked it up with some heat.   I saved the marinade in the refrigerator while the pork cooked and when ready brought it to a rolling boil on the stove for 2-3 minutes to kill any bacteria and drizzled over the pork. I cooked at 350 until done so the pork would be tender.

I loved this. I added the juice of an orange to the marinade, and cut down on the chile sauce. I marinated for 2 hours, then removed my 1lb tenderloin and patted it dry. I pan fried the tenderloin on each side for about a minute until browned, then poured all of the marinade over the meat and put in a 400 degree oven for 18 minutes and removed from oven when internal temp was 145-150 degrees and let rest . I made a stir fry of carrots, onions and red bell pepper, and topped a pile of rice with the stirfry , tenderloin and poured the sauce over it all. It was delicious!!! Thank you for the recipe. It sounds like quite a few changes, but its pretty much the same recipe just slightly tweaked.

I am on this website again to re-print this recipe because it was a big hit with my family.
Two things I did differently. I could NOT find Asian Chile Paste at the store, so I just left it out. Secondly, instead of marinating overnight, I began this recipe in the morning and put it in the crock pot all day. DELISH!
Oh, I also put some slicked carrots in the crock pot with the roast. They made a nice side dish.

I can only give this 4 stars because I had to modify what was used based on what I had on hand. I used regular oil instead of the sesame and chili powder instead of the chile paste. It was wonderful and even my Asian food skeptical husband loved it. Will be using this recipe again.

Loved it, one of the best port tenderloin recipes I've ever done!  The only thing I changed in the recipe, I saved the used marinade I heated it up bringing it to a boil and added 1 - tbs of butter to it and made a sauce out of it to serve over it.

This recipe is an absolute keeper.  Some of the reviewers said that the seasame oil was too strong.  I never use sesame but regular canola oil.  Sesame oil tends to get very strong if it gets old and I don't like the taste so I never use it.  It comes out wonderful and my family all loves it.  I also think as far as the tenderness goes thats why you let it sit covered for at least 10-20 minutes before carving.  As long as it is covered it continues to cook and keeps all tenderness in the meat. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

This is amazing. I also add ginger, and instead of baking it I BBQ it like in a Korean restaurant. Boil the marinade for a few minutes and you can use it as a sauce. So delicious!

When I followed directions, the top of pork became black and a undesirable taste. When roasting my fire alarm went off of smoke, so be careful and add some water in pan. I suggest to cook completly. Add pinnapple and juice to sauce but cook at a lower Temp & but use lower temperature and cook longer.

This was pretty good.  My chili sauce was spicy so this was to.  I did not marinate overnight just a couple of hours.  I would have cooked it a lot less as we like our pork medium to medium rare.  This was not pink at all after it rested.  Cooking it less would also prevent the marinade from burning around the edges.  Next time I might throw it on the grill.  Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious! I used a pork loin instead of a tenderloin. The loin was about 4lbs. and I doubled the marinade recipe. I didn't add quite as much sesame oil. After it was baked(325 for 1 1/2hr.) I drained the marinade and reduced it by half and it became slightly thicker and slightly sweeter. I served it on the side so you could spoon it over your serving.

I cooked this exactly as is, and it was spectacular!  Your house will smell wonderfl for hours.  Also, when finished, I sliced it thin and served it over garlic smashed potatoes one day, and wild rice another.  Incredible dish!

Wow, was this ever good! I cut my tenderloin into steaks and then marinated for several hours. At the end of the day they went onto the grill and were absolutely wonderful. Served with sesame noodles. Thank you!

Omitted chili paste because I didn't have any and replaced green onions with regular chopped onions (again bc i didnt have any)...still came out delicious!  I used a 1 lb pork tenderloin but made the same amt of sauce indicated...used the sauce to serve on top of steamed veges and rice.  mMmMmmm!

Made this last night.  I thought that the flavor was nice.  Did not have pork tenderloin so I made it with bone in pork chops and it still tasted pretty good.

Very good!!  I think 1 1/2 tablespoons is a little too much if you're using an authentic chile paste, I used maybe 1 1/2 teaspoons.  Had a lot of flavor, and compliments all around.

This recipe was incredibly good and deserves a solid five stars! The marinade is absolutely amazing and probably would be great on chicken and maybe salmon as well.  It's definitely a keeper!

This is a great - no fuss recipe!  I use this recipe for when I need to take a meal to someone who is sick or just had a baby.  I make a couple ahead of time and freeze.  I omit the green onions and chile paste.  I also use only half of the sesame oil and double the remaining sauce recipe.  I prepare everything in a zip lock bag, put that bag inside another and freeze until ready to thaw and use.  Everyone asks for the recipe (I serve it to company a lot).

Great marinade. Next time I'll try to make it a little spicier, but it really did have great flavor. The meat almost melts in your mouth.

Definitely a keeper! Great blend of flavors. I didn't change a thing. My company liked it so well, they asked me to make it again the next night with grilled Halibut. We reserved part of the marinade, warmed, and used as a sauce to top the fish. I also found it makes great oven BBQ shrimp.

This was soooo great - That marinade is perfect! Knocked the socks off my husband, who requested we triple the marinade recipe for the next time. I think this would be good with shrimp or scallops, too. We made one of those Thai boxed stir fry noodles with it and mixed in an assortment of Asian-type veggies and chopped peanuts. Great dinner - Thank you!

Marinaded, and grilled four pork loin chops:  Didn't alter ingredients.  Tender, moist, and wonderful flavour.  Next time I will not generously top my rice with remaining marinade (which I cooked):  HOT!  However, the marinade was not 'HOT!' for a marinade.  An ono keeper.  Mahalo!

I made half the marinade for a one pound pork tenderloin and marinated this for about 9 hours.  I did cut the sesame oil back to 1 T. for my half recipe.  I didn’t have Asian chile paste, but did have and used a generous 1/2 teaspoon of Thai Chili Garlic Paste.  I cut the amount way back on that because it is super hot stuff.   The reviews are all over the place in terms of what temperature everyone used.  Well, I thought 450 degrees was a bit much, so I settled with 400 degrees.  I roasted this along with the marinade to an internal temperature of 150, then allowed it to rest for about 5-10 minutes.  It was perfectly cooked and tender with a just a slight blush of pink in the center.  This turned out very well and we both enjoyed it.  I think next time I might try to sneak in one more tablespoon of brown sugar to sweeten it up just a bit more.  And I would love to try this on the grill!

Family loved this. I usually use another recipe for pork tenderloin that uses a dry rub, but tried this, and everyone loved it. I used 2 One-pound tenderloins from Costco, and cooked it at 325 for an hour. Was very moist, tender and delicious. Pretty easy, too. I mixed the marinade and marinated all in a gallon zip plastic bag to cut down on washing up.

Loved did and so did everyone who tried it, I didn't have the "Asian Chili Sauce", so I used Hosion Sauce, I cut in small diagonal pieces and pan fried with lots of the Marinade,  Excellent.

I followed the recipe almost exactly and it was delicious! My whole family enjoyed and my in laws took home the left overs. I made two small pork tenderloins and marinated over night, that was the only deviation from the original recipe. A keeper!

This was fantastic and so easy.  My entire family said that it was a make again recipe, this NEVER happens.  I decided what I was making for dinner late in the day, only marinated for 4 hours, still very flavorful, next time I will marinate longer just to make the meat more tender.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this for dinner tonight.  I like to give the recipe a chance before making changes but the only change I made was to cook on BBQ grill.  I reserved some of the marinade to put on top slices if needed. My roast was 3 lbs. and I cooked it until 160 degrees, tented it with foil and rested it for 20 min.  Perfect and moist.  I will certainly make this again but the only thing I would do as some have suggested is to reduce the amount of Sesame Oil by half.  It was good as it was but just a little to much for our taste.  Wonderful recipe and so excited to cook a Pork Tenderloin that did not come out dry.

Best Pork Tenderloin recipe I have come across in years. Some suggestions- cook at 325 for 80 muinutes.  Just as many others I was unable to locate the Asian Chile paste.  Use Chile Garlic sauce which you can find in the supermarket as well as fresh grated ginger.  Next time I will make extra sauce so that I can serve with leftovers the next day.  Try this one, you won't be disappointed!

Delicious!!!  I added more chili paste thinking I wanted it more spicy but I went a little overboard so I was taking drinks of water after every bite but that was my fault!  The flavor was wonderful!  We had it with brown rice.

AMAZING!! I'm an average cook. I can follow a recipe and that's about it.  Every time I make this recipe, everyone thinks I'm an amazing cook!  This recipe makes you look SO good.   I usually start too late to marinate more than 30 min and my family doesn't like spicy so I use chili powder as another reviewer suggested.

This was incredible! I marinated it overnight and baked at 325 F and turned out to be one of the most tender pieces of meat I've ever eaten. I also boiled the sauce and served over the meat, but there wasn't very much left. Next time I will make extra marinade, so I will have more sauce to serve with the meat.

Fabulous! Would be a great marinade for many cuts of meat.

It was delicious! I made wasabi mashed patatoes as a side dish with it. Will absolutely make it again.

A tasty dish. Our tweaks: used half the soy sauce, 2/3 of the sesame oil, added splashes of white wine vinegar & cooking sherry. Perforating loin with carving fork all over helps marinade do its work (2 hours). After cooking a 2.5 pounder @ 335dF for 90 minutes, it looked charred and lovely though was a little bit too done (160d internal) -- for my taste,  not for others'. But it was still very moist and juicy. Served w/basmati rice w/cardamoms and a stir fry of mushrooms, scallions, garlic, carrot slices and rutabaga wedges. Good one!

This was truly "ono" as we say in Hawaii.  I used chili garlic sauce as a substitute for the chili paste. I marinated overnight and threw on the grill. I have also prepared in the oven. You will not be disappointed!  PS, I did not use as much sesame oil as described. I used about 3 tablespoons, otherwise you would lose the soy flavor. Also, fresh grated ginger adds ZING!

Delicious, I basically tried this recipe because my friend Linda McLean said it was good. I took her advice,  as I usually do, and left it for 20 hours.
Only change I made was use Splenda brown sugar and gut the amount in 1/2.  Did not use Worcester to cut down on the salt. Did not have Asian chili powder so used regular. Not any serious changes that I could tell.
A nice change to pork tenderloin!

This tasted so yummy!  I hate pork, but the marinade was so delicious. The green onions definitely added a lot of flavour to it!  I pan-fried it instead of grilling and it still tasted wonderful.

UPDATED: I know what went wrong with the first time I made this meal. I used the wrong cut of meat. I didn't realize that pork loin and pork tender loin are two very different cuts.  This time I followed the recipe to the letter and it was fantastic. Served with blanched Chinese broccoli and jasmine rice.

This was fabulous... I made exactly as recipe stated; only change I made was to roast at 325 for 45 mins.  It had just the right amount of sweet/hot flavor.

I added a little water, maybe 1/3 to 1/2 cup, to thin out the marinade so that we could use it, cooked, as a sauce over rice without it being too salty. It turned out perfectly! I agree that the meat should be cooked at a lower temperature for longer to prevent scorching the garlic. I baked it at 325 for about 85 minutes to reach 145 degrees internally.

This deserves TEN stars!!! I followed the recipe to the letter, only thing I did different was to let my loin marinade for 24 hours. I baked it at 325 degrees for 90 minutes. This was soo juicy and tender and delicious! I'll always make pork loin this way.

This was so delicious!  I followed the recipe as written with the following exceptions:  regular soy sauce instead of lite, doubled the brown sugar, used onion powder instead of green onion, used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic.  I mixed up the marinade and poured it over a 2 1/2 pound boneless pork sirloin roast in a pyrex baking dish and let it marinate for around an hour at room temperature.  While marinating I kept turning the roast over and spooning the marinade over it to make sure it was coated well.  I then baked the roast in the pyrex dish that I marinated it in (with the marinade) in a 325 degree oven for 60 minutes.  I took the roast out of the marinade and put it onto a serving platter and poured the marinade into a saucepan and boiled it with cornstarch to make a sauce.  I served it with white rice with the sauce drizzled over it and a roasted chile-garlic broccoli recipe that I got from the Cooking Light website (highly recommended).  This was a very delicious meal that both of my teenagers gobbled up.  I will definitely put this recipe in my rotation!  :)  Thank you for a delicious recipe.

This is so delicious! I made it for New Year's Eve and got rave reviews. I didn't change a thing except that I convection roasted it at 325 degrees. I did as another reviewer suggested and preserved the marinade, boiled it, then added water and corn starch until I got my desired taste/consistency for a gravy. I served it with jasmine rice. Did I mention it's delicious??

Just tried this and it came out AWESOME. Used a little bit less regular soy sauce because it's what I had and it wasn't too salty at all. Meat was very tender and flavorful. I'll be making this again for sure!

We love this!  I've made it about five times.  I support all the same suggestions: marinate overnight and use the marinate to make a drizzle.  I never have leftovers and there are only three of us.

Tried this for four people with pork tenderloin chops, the boneless oval ones. It was fabulous. I also took the marinade, after it came from the oven, and put it in a saucepan, added some honey and brown sugar and two packets of Real Orange. Boiled it, and served across bias sliced pork, and rice. We had Sweet and Spicy Green Beans (from this site) with it. EXCELLENT!

Very good. Cooked at 325 for 90 min. Put the pork in a pyrex dish which I sprayed with pam. Pork on a rack, covered with marinade and added some chicken stock to the marinade after the first 30 min. Added more chicken stock when needed.
The only thing I changed in the ingredients was added additional sugar.
This is a definite make again

This recipe is so good!   We marinaded our pork for about 12 hours. The only recommendation that I would make is to make extra sauce because it is so tasty.

This absolutely rocks! It works on so many levels. Marinate for 4 hours, 8 . . . whatever works. Add more or less sugar. More or less soy sauce. Add 1 1/2" chopped ginger. It all works! Bake 450d F for 15 minutes, then reduce to 400d F for about 30 until internal temp. reaches 150d. Serve with the suggested Bok Choy, mushroom, celery and ramen noodle saute another commenter wrote about. Add cashews  as well. This saute was also outstanding. This was so good, I signed up on allrecipes.com.

This was great.  I was looking for a pork recipe with a little different flavor and this one did the trick.  I didn't have any chile paste, so I used Siracha HOT Chili Sauce (it's the one you can buy in most grocery stores where you can see the chile sauce in a clear bottle with a green squeeze top).  My husband is the pork lover and he said it was great too.

Great flavor!  It was a bit dryer than I'd hoped.  I used a meat thermometer to ensure it was cooked to the recommended safe temperature. Perhaps using a cut of pork with a bit more fat would have helped.  Overall it was good.

oh my oh my, this is good!!!  made only a few minor changes (used Splenda Brown instead of brown sugar, and onion powder when i discovered i'd forgotten to buy green onions), left it in its marinade for 4 days, and grilled it---it was brilliant!  both my husband and i loved it, and it will be appearing on our dinner table again!  thank you!!!

While this was certainly edible I did find it just average for me.  So many other recipes I prefer to this one.  I thought it was too much sesame oil and a bit salty even though I did use low sodium soy sauce.  Will not make this one again.

This was an easy marinade to put together. I marinated for only 5 hours because I misread the recipe. But the meat still took on the flavor. I tried to slow roast like other reviewers suggested but 90 minutes did not cook mine through. So I would go back to the original recipe if you are not using one of those tiny Hormel things.  My daughter and I liked it. My boys did not.

Instead of using pork tenderloin, I used meaty chicken wings and they were great!  I didnt have worcestershire sauce, so I used fish sauce instead and for the chili paste I used a Vietnamese garlic chili sauce. I also added more garlic and more green onion.  After marinating it for 24 hours, I let the wings bake for about 1 hr or so until brown, crispy and succulent. I basted the wings during the cooking time. For those that think the sesame oil is overpowering dilute the sesame oil with a lighter tasting oil like canola or another vegetable oil. Update: I finally made the dish with pork tenderloin but I didnt have as much time to marinate it, so I threw everything in a blender and marinated for a couple of hours. I also grilled it on the BBQ it was tasty.

I halved the recipe for a 1lb tender.  I didn't have enough sesame oil so I added 1t of toasted sesame seeds.  Marinated for 2 days.  I would have given this 5*, but my smoke alarm went off three times while cooking.  You lose 1* for scaring my cat!

My boyfriend RAVED about these. I didn't have lite soy sauce so I used regular and I added lots more chili paste since we love spicy food. It came out great! TIP: Buy sesame oil and soy sauce at your local Asian Market and it'll be 1/3 cheaper.

Husband loved this dish.  I used pork chops.  Followed recipe exactly except used chili sauce instead of chili paste.  I found the sauce really good...but a tad strong.  Considering the ease of this dish, will make again.  Made with "Fried Rice with Cilantro" from this site...good combination.

Holy cow, this is a fantastic recipe!  I can't believe how simple it is to make.  I didn't have time to let it marinate overnight, but I was able to let it marinate for 5 hours.  It was still delicious!  The next time I make this, I will definitely prepare the night before and let is soak.  This is a keeper and will make it again!****UPDATE:  Made it again since my brother kept reminding me how much he enjoyed this loin.  I was able to marinate it overnight, actually for about 15 hours and did it really infuse the flavor!!  If you have the time, I highly recommend marinating overnight as it soaks up all the flavor.  I also poke a few holes into the loin so it sucks up the sauce while marinating.   SUPERB RECIPE!! *********

I've made this 4 or 5 times... as is.  I did not change the ingredients at all.  Last year I made it for Christmas and marinated for 3 days, ahead of time.  It was AMAZING and melts in your mouth.  Also, the drippings make the BEST gravy.  Try it!  Everyone asked for this again, this year so it is now a family Christmas tradition (But its great for regular week nights, too).

Wow, super good! The marinade is a little on the spicy side, so if you're making this and have someone that is sensitive to spice, be warned. I also cooked this at 450F for 30 minutes, let rest for 15, and it came out medium rare. I was a little leery of eating it so I put it back in for 10 minutes.

This was outstanding! I changed a few things after reading some of the other reviews.  I added at least 1/8 cup of minced fresh ginger.  I used Sambal Oelek Asian chili paste which gave it a great spicy flavor. Back off a little on that if you don't want it a little hot.  I only had one larger green onion, but it seemed sufficient.
** Cooking: I gave it 10 minutes at 450F but then turned it down to 350F.  After 20 minutes, check the temperature. It required another 5 minutes to get it to a perfect 140F internal temperature. I'd go with 138-140F. I did reserve most of the marinade and brought it to a boil in a pot, adding a little cornstarch slurry for slight thickening, topping the slices with it.

I loved this.  Substituted about 1 t. red pepper flakes for the chili paste and pepper and eliminated green onions.  Marinated overnight then dumped the whole thing in a glass roasting dish & baked 1 hour at 325 as others suggested. Really tender and flavorful. Highly recommend.  I did find that the sauce burnt to the bottom of the pan, (maybe because of glass dish?) but that did not take away from the flavor of the meat.

didn't have chili paste on hand - will get some at the store now for sure... but this was GOOD! followed otherwise 100% ingredients - did cook it longer was a little on the pink side so back in the oven it went.  will cook low and slower next time.  other than that this was PHENOMINAL!! ate it cold out of the frig the next day and it was still so tender!! Think I might use this on a flank steak as well

Excellent flavor and tenderness from this recipe! I only omitted the chili paste (kids eating it)and decided to slow cook it in the crockpot. The meat was fall-apart tender and the sauce was different and delicious. Served it with stir fry veggies and Jasmine rice. I did double the sauce so I was sure there would be plenty for the rice, etc. Definitely a keeper for us.

this was delicious! i would definitely make it again - although I would reduce the temperature. There was a lot of smoke and the pork was a little dried out. Also, when they say use a foil lined pan - they are NOT kidding! It's been a week and I still am soaking and scrubbing the pan!

We really liked this!  I cut the chili paste to 1/2 teaspoon since ours is really spicy, and I cut the pork into cubes before marinating it.  I cooked it in batches in a bit of vegetable oil.  Everyone in my family enjoyed it, including the super-picky eater!

This is my go-to Asian pork recipe. The flavor is awesome but is over-the-top awesome if marinated for two days. My only change was to add minced ginger.  Next time I will also double the marinade and then boil it on the stovetop and add cornstarch/water to thicken so it  can be used as a sauce for rice.  Like another reviewer, one time I did it in the slow cooker. It was on low for 11 hours and the meat was so tender it came apart in chunks with a fork piercing. Served it with rice.

Fantastic recipe, of course I added: fresh ginger and cilantro. The hubby called it a winner. Sauteed zucchini and shitake mushrooms, added sauce to veggies (from pork loin) and served over soba noodles...FANTASTIC!

Delish! I marinated the tenderloin in this marinade for about 24 hours and it was awesome! So much flavor and the pork stayed nice and moist! My husband loved it and it's becoming a staple in our household.

Fantastic! I marinated for about 4 hours, then, sliced into medallions, and marinated another 4 hours.
Heated a little olive oil and pat of butter in st steel skillet, and pan-fried. O-M-G! Incredible. My only substitute was Hot Chili Oil, instead of Asian chile paste. Made Sesame noodles and Sweet/Sour green beans as sides. It was awesome!

This was delicious and easy. I bought one of those giant Cosco/Sam's Club packages of pork tenderloin that amounted to around 5.67 lbs. of meat. I tripled the marinade ingredients. I made green beans to go with it and served them with the sauce from the meat drizzled over them. If you wanted to make rice, that too would be delicious with the sauce over it.

Tender and tasty.  Best pork recipe I've had.  I keep marinade ingredients exactly as written but also add 1 tsp minced ginger.  I tried cooking this at 400 degrees for 30 minutes and the marinade has always  burned terribly --  super smelly kitchen, but very tasty, tender pork.  Next time I'll try 325 degrees for longer as suggested.  Or just roast the tenderloin without the marinade.  d

This is delicious.  I didn't marinade overnight; instead I put the sauce over the pork inside of a foil packet tightly sealed and let it braise for about 3 hours in a low oven (around 250).  It came out so tender and flavorful!  I agree with previous reviewers that you have to use low-sodium soy sauce or it will be very salty!

My family LOVES this recipe!  My husband raves about it and the man who never has a suggestion as to what to make for dinner actually says "Hey why don't we buy a pork tenderloin so you can do that thing you do with it" meaning this recipe!  :o)  I Love the recipe just the way it is, however, I could not find chili paste, so I used chili sauce instead!  Also, I did use less sesame oil than the recipe calls for as I do not care for an over-powering sesame oil flavor.  Otherwise, it is just PERFECT!  I serve it with my home made fried rice and everyone is happy!

I normally don't rate recipes but this one was simple and really delicious.  I followed the advice of others and marinated it over night and roasted it at 425 F (220 C) for 25-30 minutes.  Very flavorful.  I wish I had reserved some of the marinate for a gravy.

I will definitely make this again. Used all the ingredients as listed and marinated the tenderloin for over 24 hours. As it was roasting I made the rest of the marinade into a sauce by adding a bit more brown sugar, a tiny bit of flour and simmering it until thickened. It was sweet, savory and just tasty!

I needed a recipe for an asian chuck roast but couldn't find one. So I used the recipe as my guide and it worked out fabulously. After browning the roast in a saute pan, I placed it in my crockpot with the marinade sauce, plus 1 can of COKE, for 3-4 on low. Now, i will have to try this one. I love the sesame oil:)

Absolutely delicious! I cut the sesame oil to 1/8 cup and used Thai Chili Garlic Paste. I marinated it about 12 hours, then baked at 350 for @45 min.  The smell as it baked was heavenly, and for once, I think I was more excited over it than my husband, who is such a carnivore! The cooked marinade makes an excellent gravy when thickened w/cornstarch. This will be a regular.

This was very flavorful and yummy!  Did as another reviewer suggested and decreased the sesame oil to 1TBS.  Also, used LEE KUM KEE Chili Garlic Sauce as I didn't have any plain on hand and it worked great.  Marinated for 6-7 hours and it had plenty of flavor.  Will make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

We let the tenderloin sit overnight and cooked it on the grill instead. I grilled up some broccoli to serve along side it and turned the extra marinade into a sauce that we drizzled over the pork and veggies. We added a few cashews on top to finish it off. Great taste and presentation. Wish I had taken a picture :)

Very flavorful.  I prepared this with a slight variation.  I cut the tenderloin in half legnthwise making them smaller. After cooking, cut them legnthwise again, then cut across into little cubes.  Stuck each one with toothpick and took as an appetiser to a party.  Was a big hit.

Our family liked this a lot.  I had to cheat a little because I was short on time.  I sliced my tenderloin into 3/4" thick chops and marinated them for only about 2 hours, then pan-fried them quickly on each side, about 5 minutes total.  That left them totally coated in marinade, and really tender!

I've made this twice now and it was delicious both times. Once I baked as directed and the second time I cooked the sliced tenderloin in a skillet. It is very tender and went great with rice.

This was very good....i did the sauce and left it in frig for 8 hr. I cooked it in the rotisserie for about 10 min per pound and covered it with foil for another 10 min. It was juicy and very tasty..I think this sauce would be great on chicken.

good marinade.  I put up the tenderloin into four pieces and poked holes in with a fork so it woudld absorb better.
Use tabasco instead of chile paste, and added fresh ginger.

We thought this was an ok dish.  I did add ginger as suggested by another reviewer, and I used spicy thai chili sauce instead of paste.  I also reduced the amount of sesame oil to 1 Tbsp.  In the end, it was alright, but we didn't feel that the flavours really penetrated the meat (just the outside of the tenderloin), and this was after marinated for nearly 2 days.  So it didn't taste bad...we've just had way better.

Just made this using less of the oil, and sriracha instead of chili paste. I also used chives pulled from my garden.  No issues with saltiness. I doubled the recipe and marinated two tenderloins in two separate ziplock bags about 7 hours. I cooked in oven at 400, for about 30min (I use a meat thermometer and cook till around 135) then let rest for 10min. I simmered the leftover marinade in a large skillet till cooked down, and used as a sauce.  Very very yummy.

This was delicious, and my entire family loved it. That doesn’t happen everyday, as picky palates often prevail. The only change I made to the recipe was to delete the brown sugar, as we are limiting as many carbs as possible. I substituted two packets of Splenda for the necessary sweetness and that worked well.  It may have caramelized better with the brown sugar, but it still produced a rich, thick and delicious sauce.  I served it with roasted broccoli and Asian sesame ginger slaw. Thanks for a great recipe.  This one’s a keeper for sure!

I love this recipe, very tasty,  even my 11 yr old grandson loved it and he hates everything.  I knew I wanted to use the marinade, but I also knew I didn't want to use this cooking method, so I used a 2# pork  sirloin-tip roast, marinated for a few days (not my choice, it just happened) and cooked it using  the High Heat method. 20minuites in 500 degrees and it was perfection. I almost always use the high heat method with pork because it's perfection...I only gave the 4 star because I didn't follow the receipt exactly, YUMM! Try it's sooo good.

This is awesome.  I did halve the sesame oil and substituted the Asian chili paste with Korean red pepper paste (go chu jang).  It has never failed me for a big crowd.

Excellent meal - I made it just as suggested other than I put everything in a one gallon zip loc bag to marinate instead of  using a pan.  Using heavy foil to line a casserole dish when baking it meant I had zero clean up too ;-) Sauce was excellent and meat was flavorful and  very tender.  Looked pretty enough for company, but easy enough for any day.  I marinated it about 8 hours (I've found too long in the marinade can make a pork tenderloin mushy so I watch the time now).  I cooked it a bit longer than suggested (maybe my tenderloin was thicker than most?) so I suggest being a little flexible in your cooking time.  Meat sliced and held together well, so presentation was picture perfect also.  I can see this sliced and arranged on a platter with sauce on top at a buffet or holiday meal - it really is a very pretty dish!

This was quite good especially for a last minute weeknight dinner.  I would actually award 4.5 stars. It marinaded for approximately an hour.  I made the sauce using minced shallots and Siracha chili sauce as that's what I had on hand.  My tenderloin was not 2# so I adjusted the cooking time accordingly.   I did not read the previous reviews so I'm sure some of my points have been addressed. Much of the sauce burned on the aluminum foil roasting at 450*.  Next time, I will double the marinade/sauce and add ginger.  In half the sauce, I will marinate the pork then use the sauce for basting the pork while roasting instead of roasting in the sauce.   With the other half of the sauce I will add sauteed mushrooms and reduce to about 1/2 to serve tableside as a sauce.  I will also roast at 400* instead of 450*.  All in all, this was a really good recipe that just needs some adjustment for our personal preference.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I cooked a large tenderloin... maybe 5lbs.  I doubled portions, but it could still use more asian flavors.  Also cooked it a little longer to 45mins.

Such a delicious and easy thing to make! I only made small changes to the recipe. I added two tsp grated fresh ginger. Also I let the tenderloin marinate for four hours. It was still super moist.

I made this twice, second time with 3 tablespoons of honey instead of brown sugar, marinating it for about 6 hours and grilling it. This recipe turned out better than the first time, and the first time was a 4.5 out of 5 stars. We have a gas grill with 3 burners. I heated the grill to its max, turned off the back burner while keeping the front two on high. By placing the pork over the non-lit burner in the back and turning frequently, it created a nice browned crust which kept the juices in. I then turned down the front two burners to medium high and grilled the pork until juices ran clear when pressed. After removing pork from grill, I let it rest for a few minutes before slicing. The flavor was spectacular and the pork was moist and tender.

I made this absolutely wonderful recipe and it turned out wonderful!!  My husband wants more and I have shared this with others already and they felt the same way.  The only thing different that I did was to roast the tenderloin in a hot oven-450 degrees on an aluminum foiled baking pan for 13-14 minutes.  It came out perfect with a pink center.  The leftovers were just as good the next day too.  Thank you for the recipe!

Easy to make, very tasty and a quick clean up gives it five stars in my book. I reduced the soy sauce to a smidge over 1/4 cup and didn’t add the green onions as I didn’t have any.  Otherwise the sauce was made as written.  I did cook it at 325 for about 85 minutes.  I had two 1 lb tenderloins and drizzled some marinade over the meat for cooking and heated the rest with 1/2 tsp cornstarch to serve with the meal.  It didn’t make a lot of sauce but was enough to spoon over the slices and the brown rice we had with it. The meat was moist and tender and my husband especially loved the sauce.  This recipe is a keeper!

YUM!! Yes, I made some of the suggested changes, but this still gets 5 stars for flavor and ease of prep. The taste is phenomenal and the tenderloin lived up to its name: tender! I did lower the amount of oil and used EVOO, used Asian chili sauce from chain (Buffalo) Wing Shop instead of paste, and altered the time/temp, as follows: covered w/foil and cooked at 400 deg for 30 min, checked the temp, kept it covered but lowered to 375  and cooked for another 15 min, then uncovered for 15 min. DEFINITELY line your baking pan/dish with foil! I reserved some of the marinade before putting the pork in a zipper bag and used that to coat the stir fry veggies (green beans, baby carrots, red bell) and ramen noodles that I served with the. tenderloin. Sooo good, will make again for sure --thank you for the recipe : )

I made this for three generations of my family and they all enjoyed it very much. I have never had such juicy pork tenderloin before. I served with lemon garlic egg noodles , snow peas and broccoli.   So good that we fight over leftovers.  It has a nice mild flavor. The only thing I didn’t have was the Chili paste so I just omitted it.   I think I will continue to make it this way.

It was very good. Didn't change anything except I cooked it on the grill instead of in the oven.  I'd make it again.

I've made this several times now and it's great every time!  I follow the recipe exactly although I think it would be great with some of the additions other reviewers have mentioned.  I use pork tenderloin  (not pork loin) and it cooks perfect as specified in the recipe.  I will confess I have made this a few times with only  an hour or so of marinade time and it's still great!  It works great for me as a last minute throw together meal. Thanks for giving us a great family favorite!

Came out awesome. I rated it four stars just because it didn't make me cry it was so good, but was still very good!

One tweak - the pork for some reason took longer to cook than the 30 minutes after i refrigerated it overnight... took me about 50 minutes ... at 450.... 

VERY good recipe!

It's delicious. I did change the chili paste for Sirachia sauce and used regular chicken broth not low sodium.  I did not add any salt as called for.  Also, could not buy a pork tenderloin but used a rolled pork loin.  I  highly recommend roasting it at 325F for 80-90mins. This will make it incredibly tender! It literally melted in my mouth. You MUST use light soy sauce, otherwise the regular soy sauce is too salty. At the end of roasting, the marinade was greatly reduced. You can put the marinade in a pan on the stovetop, whisk in some flour or corn starch, add mushrooms  to make a gravy. Needed to let the mushrooms cook, about 20 minutes in the gravy sauce, stirring frequently. 
 Absolutely delicious!!! Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

Amazing!  Made it just like the recipe said, and it was delicious.  My husband was commenting on how good the house smelled while it was baking.

We cooked a tenderloin like this, and then sliced it up to go in Vietnamese spring rolls.  It was super tasty... and not just a few pieces of the meat went straight in our mouths before making it into spring rolls.

This is excellent and easy.  Spicy but not too hot.  I marinated it in a ziplock for about 36 hours (plenty of marinade for two tenderloins).  I roasted it at 425 degrees on convection bake, basting it with the marinade halfway through, until about 155 degrees.  I will definitely be making this again.

We used a heaping tablespoon of yellow Thai curry and a dollop of Asian Chile sauce in place of the Asian Chile paste. We also let it marinate for about 36 hrs and then cooked it at 300f by mistake for half an hour. Then we gave it another fifteen or so at the proper ish temperature. Anyway it turned out freaking incredible. Juicy and extremely flavorful and tender.

Very tasty!  I followed the suggestions of cutting back on sesame oil, adding ginger, and cooking at a lower temperature. I’m very pleased with the results but if I were making for company I’d cut back on the chili paste.  I appreciate the heat but many others do not.

Loved it! My tenderloin was two 1# pieces instead of one 2# piece. I also cooked the meat in the marinade. There is none left, and all my kids had seconds! Will definitely be making again.

I made this recipe using two 1lb pork loins, using the same ingredients. I marinated them for about 18 hours, flipping every so often. Also, I followed a suggestion to cook at a lower temp. I cooked the pork loins on 325°F for 80 minutes, flipping once (40 minutes into cooking time). Came out delicious and tender. Recommended.

I cut the sesame oil in half and marinated this overnight. I cooked it at 325 for about 75-80 minutes then turned it up to 375 for the last 15ish or so. I also took another reviewers suggestion and made a "gravy" out of the leftover marinade by just adding a cornstarch slurry and less than 1/2 cup of water and boiling it for a few minutes. Poured that right on top of the now SLICED pork loin and that sent it over the top! Will definitely make again, this was a big hit!

I made this today, like others I cut the Sesame oil in half and used Olive oil for the other half. The flavour was amazing. Cooked at 325 for 80 minutes but the marinade burned. Next time I'd make extra marinade to make sauce

this is my go-to recipe whenever I have a tenderloin. my tip would be..  create a "boat", gently wrap the loin in aluminum foil.  this keeps the meat covered in the marinate while cooking instead of spreading out and drying up in the pan.

I really liked this pork roast; however,  I felt the marinade was too salty, so I kept adding brown sugar until it cut the saltiness.  I didn't have a single tenderloin as it was two that looked like one, but the advantage to that was we got two meals out of the tenderloins.  I lowered the temperature of the oven and only cooked about 25 minutes.  Very tender and tasty.

Prepared pretty much as written. Marinaded for 20 hrs. Subbed Thai chili sauce in place of the Asian chili paste. Roasted a 2 lb cut for 1 1/2 hrs at 325 deg.  Came out great!  Very juicy and really good flavor!  Boiled the marinade, thickened with corn starch added 8 oz of shrooms, served it all over rice. Did someone already say, best pork I ever ate? DW liked it even more!

Very disappointed because we had this marinating overnight & I couldn't taste anything. It was moist, but we did put on the grill as others suggested.  My husband thought it should be rated higher so we'll try again. I couldn't taste or smell the sesame oil even & that is strong smelling.  Maybe we'll sear & bake to see if that makes a difference.

Prior to roasting, sear the pork on all sides in a skillet.
Also, highly recommend cooking the roast in a tent otherwise it will dry out

This is a very tasty sauce but there is on;y one problem:
What remains of the sauce after cooking the roast will be watery and diluted from the juices of the roast.
I would recommend making extra sauce and cook it down a bit to thicken it while the roast is in the oven and use it as a garnish.

This was easy to prepare and tasted fantastic.  I love pork tenderloin because it cooks so quickly.  I would advise to not cook too long as a tenderloin is a very lean cut of meat.  We quickly grilled our tenderloins over direct flame on all sides, and then placed it up on the top rack of our BBQ to finish cooking through.  I doubled the garlic and added about a tbs of fresh ginger.  For leftovers, we cooked up some chow mein noodles and thinly sliced up some cabbage, broccoli and carrots.  It's a super quick and tasty meal the next night as well!  You could also slice up the pork and make some fresh salad rolls with rice paper rounds.

I made this almost exactly as-is, but added 1tsp of fresh minced ginger to the marinade.

I let it marinade for about 24 hours, then grilled it over charcoal with some hickory wood chips. 

I got the grill nice and hot - around 450°F - 500°F to get those nice grill marks and a nice char to it. Then, I dipped the pork back into the marinade, wrapped it in foil, and placed it on the top rack until the internal temp reached 145°F. 

This is probably the best recipe I’ve made to-date for pork tenderloin (so says the gf)!

Fantastic!  We loved it. I made the marinade as written but will double it next time for sauce.  I took advice from other reviews and cooked it at 325 for about 70 minutes to 160 degrees on the meat thermometer. I let it sit for about 20 minutes. My boyfriend said it was the best pork he’d ever eaten.

This was outstanding!  Roasted to perfection.  Delicious and tender.  The only substitute I made was fresh chives for the green onion.  I would definitely fix this for company.

I made this recipe for a large luncheon I was serving (about 30 people) and it was fabulous!! I had some of the guys at the luncheon telling me they loved me because of this pork. Because I cooked the night before and rewarmed the next day to serve, I made sure I took the pork out when internal temp reached 140 degrees. This way it did not overcook / dry out in the re-warming process. It was awesome - and so moist! Everyone loved it! Thank you so much!!! I know I can always trust recipes from this website. Allrecipes ROCKS!

Couldn’t find anything I would change about this.  Made it as written, with a house full of company, and we all loved it.  It was super easy.  I marinated it the night before and Left it in the fridge until the next evening when it was time to preheat the oven.  It was cooked through, moist, tender and delicious flavors.  Will keep this in the rotation, for sure.  Thanks so much.

I didn’t have green onions I added 1/2 cup chopped onions to the marinated.  I let it marinated 36 hours and I wouldn’t do it for any shorter time.  Everyone enjoyed the roast it was very moist great flavor. Going to try it on chicken and cook in the crockpot.

My family enjoyed this recipe but the cooking time depends on how thick your pork loin is.  I did one a little under 2lbs and after 45 minutes in the oven the meat thermometer wasn't even registering.  I took it out of the oven, sliced it, poured the sauce over it and baked another 10-15 minutes to get rid of the pink.  I did marinate the pork for 2 days and the flavor was great.  Other than the baking time I didn't change anything.  Will definitely make again.

Good recipe, but low sodium soy sauce is essential! Save the marinade to reduce on the stove and make a sauce to pour over the pork when it’s done. Hubby loved it!

I really liked the way this recipe sounded; I love pork tenderloin and sesame oil, so it seemed a perfect fit.  But the end product was disappointing.  Perhaps I marinated it too long.  I took a reviewer's suggestion and cooked it at 300 for an hour and a  half, and it turned out quite hard and dry.  I still like the idea, and may try it again.

Hubby and I loved this! Followed recipe and only change for future would be to cook longer on lower temp, to make more tender. Flavour was awesome! Served with some veggies and noodles stir fried together with the extra sauce. Will be making this again!

Delicious recipe and very easy to make.  I also added some fresh minced ginger to the marinade and since it's summer, I cooked it on the grill and occasionally basted it with the marinade.  As with all marinades, I put the marinade and the tenderloin in a zip lock bag and squeezed out most of the air  for the marinating process. Yum!

The family liked this recipe. I served sliced tenderloin over rice noodles. I did need to cook my pork about twenty extra minutes.  30 minutes is not long enough. After an hour the pork was done and tender.

Will definitely  make this again. Only changes were to add grated ginger and roast at lower temperature of 350 degrees F.  Meat was very tasty and tender. We served slices of pork with coconut rice, Indonesian cucumbers, and Asian vegetable stir-fry. I want to try this with a pork loin roast in the future.

Really good and easy to make. I baked it at 400 for 40 mins and it was great. Try to reduce the salt a bit.

I will definitely make this again. I didn't use chili paste because my family doesn't like the heat. I added some hoisin instead. The pork was very flavorful!

I made it as a sauce instead of a marinade. It needs way less oil when done that way. I also added a small amount of corn starch to thicken it. It was fragrant and tasty, and I'm excited to make it again!

This absolutely delicious.  I served it to a couple of foodie friends and got wild raves.  Definitely a great recipe.  The only changes I made were the addition of some ginger, as others recommended, and some fresh lime.  I think it would have been great anyway, but I like these flavors in the mix.

This was delicious! I didn't have the chili paste, but I added some Hoisin sauce to taste. Made extra after trying the sauce as I knew we were going to put it on everything! Will make again!

After reading the other reviews and what other people had recommended, I put the tenderloin in the oven at 325 for 80 minutes. Ended up great and tender!!

Would definitely recommended taking the extra marinade and moving it into a sauce pan and adding some corn starch to thicken it up. Put that thicker sauce over the final sliced product and you'd have an amazing dish. Also, a side with something green would also be helpful.

Made a couple changes. Onion powder instead of Green Onion and Chili powder and Red Pepper Flakes instead of the Asian Chili Paste. Plus I halved the Sesame Oil and Garlic along with adding Ginger. Cooked in a Crock Pot on low for 4 hours, turned out pretty good. A little dry and the flavor wasn't as strong as I would have liked, but that's on me. I would definitely make again though!

I added ginger and cooked it at 330 for 90 min. It was delicious! The kids found it a touch spicy with the chili sauce. I made cilantro rice that paired well with it. I will be making this one again.

This is the best pork tenderloin marinade I've ever used, and I've used many!  I made it exactly as the recipe called for and I marinated it for 24 hours.  It tasted so good and, even though pork tenderloin is pretty tender to being with, this marinade made it even more tender.  And, it was easy to make with easy to find ingredients.  Loved it!

I had 2 x 2 lb pork tenderloins but I kept the scale as written, I reduce the sesame oil to 1 tbsp and halved the pepper and chile paste. I marinated for 60 hours as something came up and we were delayed. I used the low and slow method of 325 for 80 minutes and it was perfect. I lined the pan with parchment, clean up was easy, I poured off the juices/marinade once it finished cooking, boiled and thickened with cornstarch for a sauce. Very flavourful and tender.

Our entire family absolutely loved this recipe - even our 2 fussy teenagers. We marinated overnight and cut back on the sesame oil to about half of what is called for. As others suggested we also lowered the temp to 325 and baked for about 90 minutes. Other than that, pretty much followed the recipe as written. We also saved the marinade and boiled it and added to ramen noodles to make a nice noodle side dish.

I will definitely make it again.  I may tweak it a little to give it a little more "oomph" but it was delicious as is.  We did bake it at 350 for just over an hour. Hubby and kids liked it as well.

We loved this delicious pork tenderloin! Thank you for the recipe. I'm not very familiar with cooking pork, so I followed the recipe exactly. I can't imagine that it could have been any better if I had of changed anything. It was perfect! I served it with homemade vegetarian fried rice (with peas & scallions) and Awesomely Easy Sesame asparagus (from this website too) and baked crescent rolls.  What a feast! My husband said it was the best meal he's ever had (?!) except for Morton's Steakhouse which is where we celebrate special occasions. It looked so pretty & fancy on the plate too, suitable for company.

If I can give it more stars, I would!! Absolutely fantastic!! the first time I made it I followed the recipe to the letter but cut back on the Chilli because I was afraid it would be too spicy for my toddler. big mistake. so this time i added the full amount and it was much better. I also didn't have time to marinade the second time around so I just dumped everything in the casserole dish and baked it... and it still turned out excellent. After the pork was done, I let it rest on the chopping board. In the mean time I took the leftover marinade and boiled it on the stove top in a saucepan. I thickened end it with cornstarch+water and served it on the side so my family can have it on their rice and veggies that accompanied this succulent meant. :)

This is definitely a keeper! I made this the other night for a small dinner party and received rave reviews (sadly there were no leftovers so I will double it next time). I didnt realize I had no brown sugar so substituted white sugar with a little bit of honey and added crushed ginger, and it was great. I followed reviews and reduced the temp and cooked longer. Next time I will try with brown sugar and marinate longer, and may even try to make in the slow cooker. Thanks so much for posting this recipe!!

Um. Yes! Great recipe. I did not have to marinade for 8 hours. I simply poured it on top and threw it in the oven. There were three changes I made to the recipe (I am confident that if I had followed the recipe exactly it would have been just as great). I had no green onions (they would have kept my kids from trying it anyways), I used Braggs instead of soy sauce (I got rid of that sodium riddled stuff for the better alternative long ago), and I added a little bit of cold French press coffee (just a splash). I could barely taste it but there were subtle notes. It was so tender! No knife needed!

We liked the flavor and reduced the cooking temp to 350 degrees.  We think it was the Aldi's pork loin that may have ruined this for us; we never used their meat before and it was rubbery.  We will try again with a better loin.

Liked this very much but a little too spicy for me!  Next time I will either leave out the chilli paste or pepper!  I would add grated ginger too and a bit more brown sugar!  I cooked it at the 450 it suggests for 30 minutes and doubled the sauce for 3 tenderloins, it was just a slight pink in centre! Perfectly cooked for me.

This was amazing!!  My family loved this!  I didn't have green onions so I used chpd red onions.  Also, I used chili pepper flakes instead of the paste.  Grilled the tenderloin from Costco on low (high on the non meat side of the BBQ) turning every 10 mins for about 45 mins or so.  This worked on chicken but much better on the pork!!

This really was a fantastic recipe.  I love tenderloin, but I've had a really difficult time in not having a dry, boring piece of meat.  I marinated for about 8 hours.  I didn't really alter the recipe as much as I just didn't have somethings, but all in all, I think the main components were there or equally substituted and the flavor came out perfect.  My wife is not a left over eater, but this, the entire family had no problem eating later.  This is definitely my new go-to recipe. It's totally up to you, but I removed my tenderloin right when the internal temp hit 140. Very juicy and cooked throughout, but not dried out.

I have made this at least 5 times. Sooo good. I add the green onion into the marinade and marinate it for 24hrs. Comes out perfect every time. Moist and super tender.

Delish! I did use chili-garlic sauce, used regular soy sauce, used canola oil and added ginger. I cooked it at 350 for 110 mins, I had a 2.8 tenderloin. I also marinated it for 3 days. This was so good, tender and the marinate is perfect.

This recipe is on the money, 5 stars for excellent!! My wife and I were searching for something new and came across this recipe and we decided to give it a shot. The ingredients were easy to find and it didn't look to hard to make. We prepped the pork loin and let it marinate for about 6 hours. We pre-heated our oven to 450 and put that bad boy in for some cooking. Well after all was said and done  we gave this pork loin a taste and WOW this was some good eating. We recommend this recipe...Enjoy!

The first time I made this it was terrific.  This time I removed the fat and baked it in a clay pot for 90 minutes at 325 without the marinade.  Dry and overdone. It didn't help that I dropped the contents of the pot getting it out of the oven!  Next time I will leave the fat on and use the marinade , also a metal pan that won't shatter.

I tried this tonight, and used some of the suggestions from other reviews.  I lessened the sesame oil, but added a whole lot more garlic because, well, it's my favorite!  The pork smelled amazing while it cooked, which I did at 325 for about 90 minutes.  One thing I'll suggest, I let it rest too long and it got a little dry so definitely either cook a little less or stick to the 5/10 minute resting time!  Other than that, it was awesome!  The sauce was a bit too spicy for my mom, but she's not a hot and spicy person.  It was just right for me!  I will definitely use this recipe again.

This pork is AMAZING!  I followed all directions, but I only used 1 TBSP of chili sauce to be on the safe side.  I also followed the advice of many other commenters to cook low and slow.  325* for an hour, and one of my loins was ready, the other needed another 10 minutes.  I usually have a hard time being patient and letting the meat rest, but I did this time and was rewarded.  The flavor is perfect, but since it is a salty sauce I discarded what was left in the pan.  I will definitely be making this many more times!

Sooooo delicious!
Apart from adding some fresh ginger to the sauce I followed the recipe to the T. After marinating the tenderloin for 14 hours I roasted it at 160° C (325F) for 85 minutes - uncovered for the last half an hour. 
Thanks for the recipe, it's definitely a keeper!

This is easy to make and was rated 5 stars by my husband. I made additional marinade and thickened it with some cornstarch to serve. Served with rice noodles and stir fried carrots and bok choy for an easy Asian-themed supper. Thanks!

Super tasty and easy! It is very difficult to feed my family pork but this recipe was money! I substituted olive oil for the sesame oil and I added some  juices from the pan over the pork slices for even more flavor. Will definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious. The only change I made was to use less chile paste since my kids are sensitive to heat. I used 1 tsp, so it was not spicy at all and will add more next time. Loved the flavor and so easy to prepare, definitely a keeper.

Fantastic! I followed the recipe for the most part... only change was that I used another reviewer's suggestion to roast at 325 for 90 minutes. So flavorful and tender! My 4 yr old even gave it a thumbs up! :)

Very nice. Served with Wild Rice Blend and saute'd Bok Choy, this made a really tasty dinner tonight that was satisfying yet not heavy.  Marinaded in oven overnight and baked in slow oven for 2 hours.  Delicious! Couldn't be easier although finding Asian Chile Paste was not all that easy especially considering I live in the lower mainland.  We loved this and I will be keeping this recipe in my favorite file.

Kung hei fat choi! Happy Lunar New Year! I'm having some friends over for a home cooked Chinese feast this weekend, and I decided to test drive this recipe before I make it for my guests. Wow is all I can say. I will definitely be serving this at my party. I added a pinch of five spice powder, because I love five spice powder but that is the only change I made.

I followed the marinade recipe and the tenderloins were tender and juicy with a great flavor. I did throw some quartered yukon gold and red skinned potatoes on the sheet also. Baked at 350 for 50 minutes, per another reviewer. Thanks for posting this recipe ONOLICIOUS, my husband loved it.

My husband liked the meat, but I thought it had far too much sesame oil.  If I try it again I will reduce the sesame oil & add a bit of ginger to give more depth to the marinade.

I made this yesterday,modifying the recipe for a 2 and 1/2 roast,added the juice from one-half of a lime and a touch of honey. Also used red onion because did not have scallions. I did not have eight hours to marinate it,so I cooked it,on 305 F. Convect-Roast for about 80 minutes and then cooled it and refrigerated.  So it basically marinated after and still had that wonderful sauce.  My teenage,football-playing-weight-lifting  son ate almost half of it and hubby and I loved it too. Next time,I would cut back the soy sauce to maybe 1/8 cup and  add fresh,grated ginger.

This was super yummy. I marinated my tenderloin overnight, and I did have to cook it for 40 minutes rather than 30. It was so moist and tender. I served this with stir-fried broccoli, carrots, snow peas and mushrooms, and brown rice. I'll definitely make this again.

sesame oil was overpowering, and the overall taste was nothing special.
