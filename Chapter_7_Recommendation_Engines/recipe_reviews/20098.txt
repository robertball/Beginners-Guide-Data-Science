This seems to be one of those recipes where anything you want to throw into the pot is acceptable. As long as the end product tastes good, the endevour has been a success.  Several of the reviews mentioned that the "pie" was bland. This was my clue to expermient. So I put in some things to give it a kick.  First I added a can of cream corn (cause I really like corn) as several reviewers mentioned and I used mushroom soup instead of veggy soup, then three cloves of finely cut garlic. In the potatoes, I added milk and a LARGE tablespoon of creamy horseradish sauce (anything with the word horse in it should give it a "kick"). I added a dash or two of worchestershire sauce and a dash or three of garlic salt. I tossed in a can of white beans (this one gave it a real boost and I highly recommend concidering the beans as an additive). I also used more than the three cups of potatoes. I used three good sized russet potatoes. I have no idea what Colby longhorn cheese is, so I had some medium chedar that I used. The end product of this concoction was absolutely delicious! My wife, who is kinda pickey, had three helpings and I had four. Between the two of us we ate three quarters of the "pie" at one sitting!! This was really, really good and full of great flavors. Thank you Lisa for a great recipe idea.

This is truly the best Shepherd's pie we've ever had! I more than doubled the recipe and used about 3lbs of hamburg. I used a little less thyme then it called for and used condensed golden mushroom soup. I totally forgot to add the onion and celery while cooking the burger, so I sauteed them in a little butter afterwards and added it to the burger & soup mix. I layered the hamburger, then corn, then the potatoes and WOW, it was so good! There were 4 adults (very hungry ones!) and the entire 9x13 pan was gone. My dad said it was the best he ever had...even better then my mom's (which is saying a lot!) I'm making it again for Sunday football...hope there's enough! Thanks for the great recipe!

I love shepherd's pie, but the rest of my crew could probably do without, so this review is all my own. I like this recipe becasue it is your "basic" shepherd's pie recipe, so you can add or take away what you like. I spruced up my meat mixture a little more by adding chopped bell pepper, canned tomatoes and garlic to my ground meat.  It makes it a little heartier, and  I like to flavor my mashed potatoes with some garlic and onion powder.  I don't measure out the cheese...I just throw lots and lots on top. I would definitely recommed using this recipe as your foundation, and then play around with it. Thanks Lisa.

Discovered this recipe a while back, and this has become one of our favorite dishes. I add at least another onion and tons of garlic to the browning meat. I also use lots more vegatables (frozen stir-fry veggies give it a fun, interesting, and easy boost) and two cans of vegitable soup because I make a big bunch of it. I always use instant pototoes (SO much faster than the other kind and I can't really tell a differenc) and pour on the thyme because I love the unique flavor. I also pile on the cheese--because I love it! My family loves this, and I make enough to have leftovers. The best thing, though, is that you can totally change/add/remove anything you want!

This was delicious.  As I was using 1 1/2 lbs. ground beef, I increased the onion to 2/3 cup and left the celery at1/2 cup.  Just make sure celery and onion are cooked through.  I also used two cans condensed vegetable beef soup and I added about a cup of frozen peas and carrots, which I cooked first.  I only sprinkled on a little bit of thyme.  Used lots of potatoes.  Family loved it.

I never even heard of Shepard's Pie, but I thought I'd give it a try. The recipe has turned out great every time I've made it. I've even made it with boxed mashed potatoes and it still has a lot of great flavor. I personaly add a few more spices to the ground beef, throw in more veggies and use a blend of cheddar/munster cheese on top instead of Colby. It really fills you up and is great for those of us who have very little time to cook. Even my sister-in-law, who is a chef, liked the recipe. Thank you !!

I didn't like the version of this with the vegetable soup and it didn't go over well with my family. I'll stick with cream of mushroom soup.

Heavy but tasty. I used instant potatoes and added carrots and frozen peas. Iâ€™ve never heard of colby longhorn cheese, so I used colby jack. After my additions, this made about eight servings. It reheated well as leftovers. Next time I will try cream of mushroom soup instead of the vegetable.

This recipe was fantastic. I changed it just a little.I left out the thyme, and added cajun spices and italian seasoning to the ground turkey while browning it. I also added 1 cup beef broth along with the veg. soup. I used monterey jack with jalapeno peppers. Thanks for the recipe.

I also added a can of corn. An additional can of vegetables would not hurt either. I also think fresh mushrooms would be good in it. Made a great and hearty meal!

This gets five stars for ease of preparation.  I took the advice of other reviewers and threw in a few additional handfuls of frozen vegetables. I also added about 1/4 soup can of water so it would have some "gravy."  Finally, I used only a smidgen of thyme and used rosemary as the main herb.  Personal preference; I like rosemary in shepherd pie.  Husband and I loved it.

Good Stuff. I've been making this for a few years now, and my family and I enjoy it. Its easy, and tastes good. I always add a package of liptons onion soup mix to the beef as I'm browning it. It gives it more flavor. We also pour a little crystals hot sauce on each of our indiviual servings to taste.

My husband loves this recipe, he has requested it over and over and it's very simple to prepare. I don't add any thyme, simply because I don't care for the flavor and I do use a pretty thick layer of instant mashed potatoes on top (more than the original recipe calls for). This is a very hearty, "stick to your ribs" kind of meal. Perfect for brisk fall evenings. Thanks Lisa!

With a few splashes of Worchestershire sauce and a dash or three of garlic powder, this turned out to be a really tasty, comforting dish.  My husband really liked it and looks forward to having it again.

Loved it! Husband loved it! The only thing I changed was I omitted the thyme, added some hot sauce to the ground beef as I was frying it and stirred in a can of creamed corn with the soup.  this is a new favourite in my house!

My family loved this, to the meat I added a lot of garlic, ground pepper, and a little worcestershire sauce, in place of the veggie soup, as I had none in the pantry, I used a can of condensed french onion soup, added a bag of frozen mixed veggies and can of corn and they went berzerk over this, hubby especially.....I will make this again and again

This was quick and easy, and put those left over mashed potatoes to good use.  I did omit the celery and thyme and used onion powder. (my kids don't like onions) I also used frozen mixed veggies and a can of tomato soup instead of the vegetable soup.  Topped with last nights leftover garlic mashed potatoes and shredded mild cheddar.  Great comfort food!

THIS WAS A GREAT RECIPE TO FIX ON A HURRICANE DAY. WE HAVE 5 FOSTER CHILDREN AND THEY ALL LOVED IT. PRETTY GOOD SINCE THE OLDEST ONE IS 6. I DID SPICE UP THE POTATOES A BIT WITH SOUR CREAM AND GARLIC AND ADDED A CAN OF MUSHROOM SOUP AND USED MIXED VEGETABLES INSTEAD OF THE SOUP MOSTLY BECAUSE THAT WAS WHAT I HAD BUT A 5 STAR HIT AT OUR HOME

Delicious!  I added some freshly chopped carrots, green bell peppers.  I also used a few splashes of worcestershire sauce and salt & pepper (for extra flavour) to the beef mix. I also used 4 cups mashed potatoes instead of 3.  Turned out to be a huge hit.  Thanks for the great recipe -- I'll definitely be making this again!

I am only giving this 3 stars because with a few changes this recipe is so much better.  Cook the beef and onion, leave out the celery. Use any cream of soup, I think it is best with cream of mushroom. Mix soup with Cooked beef and onion. Use this as the bottom layer. Add steamed or canned corn as 2nd layer. Mashed potatoes are the third layer. The use American cheese slices to cover top.  My late father made this when mom was away. "snow on the mountain"

So good it makes me say "more" with an evil grin.  My picky hubby loved it.  We ate 2/3 of it in one sitting.  Great with cornbread.  Next time I would put another can of veggy soup with it.  Thanks for the formula friend.

This is a great base recipe for shepherd's pie.  I added a can of each cream of mushroom and cream of chicken in place of the vegetable soup.  I also added a can of corn and couple tablespoons Worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture.  For the potatoes I added sour cream, milk, butter, romano cheese, and sauteed garlic and mushrooms.  This was my first tome making shepherd's pie and it was a huge success!  Thank you!

Sorry, but I give this recipe three stars only hesitantly. For starters, even as a "basic" recipe that can be altered to suit individual tastes, salt and pepper should have been necessary ingredients. However, my husband and son had multiple servings, but that was after my addition of salt, pepper, Worstershire sauce, garlic, carrots and corn.  I also topped it off with bread crumbs along with the cheese. We also drizzled Louisiana hot sauce on our servings. In the end, my son (my most honest critic) told me that it needed more vegetables, potatoes and cheese, but as it was, I tripled the amount of vegetables, increased the amount of potatoes to 4 cups and increased the cheese up to 1 1/4 cups.  I apologize for being negative, but I wasn't terribly impressed.  Nevertheless, thank you for sharing Lisa!

This was an excellent recipe.  Next time I will cut out the celery, though - I thought it detracted a bit.  Other than that, it was good - even the kids liked it, and they are at that picky stage.

Easy to make..... however preparation + cooking time is more like 1 1/2 hours for 1 person. I used cream of mushroom rather than cream of vegetable, and added some minced carrots and corn to the beef mixture. Will try using Colby cheese rather than cheddar cheese next time around!

This recipe was really good, instead of using cream of vegetable, I used cream of mushroom soup, and added green beans, corn, and leftover roast from the night before.  I also added a mixture of other spices besides the ones listed.  I didn't have to double the soup even though there was a lot more food than the original recipe, and added a bit more cheese on top of the potatoes.   It was delicious!

This has been a family favorite since I was a kid,but my mother used cream of mushroom soup, and frozen veggies, topped with shredded cheddar cheese. Today I do the,same but I use Fiesta Mexican Mix Cheese for the topping. My family loves it all the same.

I've been using this recipe for a year now, and I thought I'd finally rate it. I have to double the recipe because my family loves it. It's super easy, and appeals to the meat and potatoes fan. I use mushroom soup like the others, and also cooked mixed veggies (frozen). I also sprinkle with garlic salt as well as the thyme.

Very good.  I changed the veggies around a little bit.  Sauted some onions, carrots, mushrooms and some minced garlic first.  Then added back in after ground beef was cooked.  I used Cream of mushroom soup because I had that on hand already.   It got rave reviews from my hubby and my father.

My husband LOVED this. Per others' suggestions, I used cream of mushroom soup, skipped the thyme (I don't like it much) and substituted colby jack. I cheated and used frozen prepared mashed potatoes, with sour cream and chive flavoring and all. It was really easy, and my husband is a big fan of it!

When I've made this before, I saute ground beef, onion and garlic together then add a package of frozen peas and carrots and a jar of beef gravy along with the spices. Then I add mashed potatoes with chedder mixed into them to the top and bake. After baking I add some more cheese on top of the potatoes.

This recipe was good but did need a little more meat and more seasonings, it was a bit bland.  My kids liked it and I will make it again with the changes above.

Great tasting and easy recipe!!! I substituted the vegetable soup with cream of mushroom like everyone else suggests, and instead of celery I added corn. I will be making this again. Thanks for sharing

I absolutely agree with many other comments. This is a good base recipe and then add other ingredients to your liking. I added Worcestershire to the meat along with a few other spices (pepper, garlic powder). I put some thawed frozen peas and carrots on the meat before adding the potatoes. I used the steam and mash potatoes from the freezer section (Ore Ida brand) and they worked great. Really easy for a weekday night. I'm a huge mashed potato snob and I thought those were just fine. Just add some butter and milk and they fluff up just fine. I'll be making this one again.

Love this recipe, great for using up leftover mashed potatoes. I used the mushroom soup and added leftover carrots, green peppers, 2 cups of cheese and fresh garlic. I didn't use the thyme thought it would clash. Definitely a keeper.

This is a wonderful recipe, very easy to make and easy to change up.  I added mixed veggies and great northern beans to mine. I also used Campbells Golden Mushroom soup (2 cans). Instead of thyme I also used oregano and worcestershire sauce, just a little of each to spice it up. I will certainly be making this again with a few more twists. I really don't think you could mess this up, anything could go in this recipe. Recreate it as many times as you'd like.

I made quite a few changes. I used a jar of Au jus instead of the soup.  I used store bought fresh mashed potatoes.  I mixed the ground beef and au jus with some garlic, a dash of worchestire sauce and put in the bottom of casserole pan. Then I put a layer of frozen corn and peas, then mashed potatoes and baked.  It was great to have the brown gravy with the mashed potatoes!

Even though several reviews said that they didn't like the thyme, I still included it because I'm quite a fan of thyme. I definitely won't the next time. Thyme just does not work with the flavors in this recipe. Otherwise, the flavors were good. I used 3 lbs of ground beef, with 1 can of cream of mushroom, 1 can of cream of celery, and about a 1/4 of a can of beef broth. For veggies I used a bag of frozen mixed peas and carrots. Steam them beforehand, though, as 30 minutes in the oven isn't enough to soften them. Mine were still crunchy.

I really loked forward to making this meal for my family and it was bad. The veggie soup and thyme made this meal to the point that we couldn't eat it. My kids enjoyed eating the cheese off the top though.

I had to make some changes.  I would suggest reducing the vegetable broth in with the meat.  I used oregano instead of thyme (I get heartburn).  The meat could also use some more flavour, maybe not lean meat since you drain the meat anyhow.  This recipe needed some corn so I layered frozen corn over the meat then the mashed potatoes.  
I was not certain about the celery but it was GREAT in this recipe.

This is a simple yet hearty and tasty meal.  Made a few changes as suggested by others.  I seasoned up the ground beef with Tony Chachere's and used golden cream of mushroom instead of the vegetable soup.  I also added in a can of corn and sprinkled some cheese on top of the meat mixture before putting the potatoes on (we made 8 servings of instant mashed potatoes).  My husband and I really enjoyed this and even our kids, who usually only eat a tablespoon of anything, ate this well.

Yummy and easy!  I used ground turkey and added some cooked carrots and peas.  Didn't have any veggie soup so added 1 veggie bullion cube and 1 cup water.  Also added 1/4 cup tomato sauce.  Used the box mash potatoes for simplicity and because they tend to be less dense.  GREAT!

It was a bit bland.  I ended up adding mushrooms and Velveeta cheese to the meat mixture the next time.  That put a little more twist to the dish.

My family really liked it.  I did use cream of chicken for the soup and I added a bag of peas and carrots, I used 2 lb ground deer, I also added  a Tbls of seasoned salt to the meat, it was a bit too much, so next time I will cut that in half.

I made this & halved it cause there are just 2 of us. My husband is a picky eater. He had seconds & said the rest is lunch tomorrow. I only used salt, pepper,&garlic powder to season. All those veggies flavors melded together very well. We will have this again.

Delicious..put my own spin by using chili meat and ground beef. I also used a few boxes of scallop potatoes, left out the celery and thyme, and used cream of mushroom soup instead of veggie soup, cajun seasonings, and extra, extra veggies. Hubby loved it!

Very easy version of Shepherd's Pie, which is just what I was looking for.  I followed the recipe as written, except that I also added some leftover corn and green beans I had in the fridge.  It's a good 'cleaning out the fridge' meal!

My kids and hubby liked it. I did change a few things. I seasoned the meat to my families liking which included garlic, salt, pepper and a bit of worchestire sauce.  I added green peppers with the meat and onions and celery.  I used cream of mushroom instead and added a can of corn (drained) everyone liked a great quick meal with some yummy rolls or corn bread make a hearty warm meal for cold rainy Seattle days!

followed some of the reviews and used a can of corn, a can of green beans and a can of mushroom soup instead of the veggie soup it says. YUMMY!

This was pretty good as is, but if I make it again I will change it up a bit. I will use more veggies and my husband wanted more meat. Other than that it was pretty good.

Always, always a hit, whether I'm at home or for pot luck. I never use celery or onion, just the veggies, for my kids' sakes. I cook a separate, smaller dish for my vegetarian, using her Morning Star crumbles, but both kids love it and go back for seconds every time.

I love this receipe, its very filling! I added some green and red peppers and a clove of garlic. I also followed the another reviewer's advice and added 
3T of Worchershire. I will definitely make this again. This was great for a beginner like me.

This is one of comfort foods. The rest of the family seems to really like this too. I add lots of garlic, I usually use cream of mushroom and some times I add veggies canned or frozen. Yum yum

Usually canned soup gives dishes a canned, cheap taste but this is a very good basic recipe.   I add a clove of garlic and double the onion.

This recipe has become a fast favorite for my husband and I.  I did change a few things (cream of mushroom soup instead of veggie, added a layer of corn, & added biscuits on top) but that's the great thing about this recipe- it's easily changed to fit each person's taste.  We love it and make it all the time, I'm SO glad I found this recipe!

Just got done eating this. I've always made shepherds pie w/ cream of mushroom soup but thought I'd try this. This way is SOO much better. I browned the hamb. in an electic skillet and added the vegetable soup to it. I omitted the celery for personal preference. I made instant mashed potatoes and put them right on top of the hamb/soup mix. Topped with cheese slices and put the cover on for a few min. till the cheese melted. Yummy!!!!

My family loved this recipe. I used the cream of mushroom soup instead of veggie soup though. My picky eater sons ate it and my spanish husband who usually won't eat my "comfort foods". This was such a sucess and for once I didn't have to make three different dinners. I am excited about this and I can't tell you how the leftover would be...there is none!!!

I made this for my husband and he thinks it is pretty good. I think the celery the recipe calls for is unecessary- there was plenty of celery in the soup. I think if I make it again I will go with the other people's suggestions of using frozen mixed vegetables and beef broth. I thought the thyme was perfect and I put even more than the recipe required and it wasn't too strong.

Made this with adjustments & turned out great!  I used ground turkey instead of beef, since I don't eat beef.  Also used a can of mixed veggies, and omitted the celery.  There were a lot of veggies in the meat mixture.  I also substituted a can of vegetarian vegetable soup for regular veggie soup.  Used 4 cps. prepared instant mashed potatoes.  Per my husband's suggestion, put about a 1/2 tsp. of chicken base (paste) & 1/4 cp. of water to add flavor since I had used 1 1/2 lbs. of ground turkey.  Turned out great, and will more than likely be even better as leftovers.

I gave it 4 stars just because I made a few changes.  I doubled the recipe, used cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soups. I also added Worcestershire sauce, parsley, and garlic powder. Instead of celery, I used a can of corn. I also increased the amount of thyme.  This is a good basic recipe and w/ the changes, I'd give it 5 stars.

I omitted veggie soup & replaced with can of creamed corn & can of cream of mushroom or chicken (whatever I have) as some others suggested. I also put more onion & use whatever cheese I have on hand as well (usually cheddar).  My husband practically eats the whole dish in one sitting!

This makes a warm, hearty, and delicious meal!  I added some garlic powder and worcheshire sauce to the meat mixture, and used one can of cream of mushroom soup in place of the vegetable soup.  I also used Cheddar cheese on top.

Very good recipe hubby ate it up! I did alter from others review's and to speed it up. I added garlic w/ the meat and then put cream of onion soup, worcestshire, salt/pepp and frozen veggies (corn, peas, carrots) and heated in pan.  Used instant potatoes and then put the hot mixture in pan and topped with cheese put it in the oven for 8 - 10 minutes with cresent rolls.  Very yummy!

I have made my own version of shepherds pie for years. I did like the idea of this recipe, but didn't have the vegetable soup. So I used cream of mushroom. Also, I used ground moose meat for this shepherds pie - delicious, and much less greasy. I also added a can of corn to the meat mixture - family preference. Omitted  the cheese as the family doesn't like it.

I really liked this..I used 1 lb of ground turkey and also some hot turkey sausage mixed in with it. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of vegetable and used a mix of colby and monteray jack cheese..it was good..I will make again.

It was easy to make, but the thyme was very overwhelming and the soup flavored overwhelmed the beef.  It wasn't bad, just not for me.  Very easy to make if in a rush though.

This is the best shepherd's pie recipe I've tasted.  I love the flavoring of the thyme and also the vegetable soup which gives it some extra moisture and flavoring.  My husband prefers the old-fashioned kind...just beef, corn and potatoes.  BORING in my opinion.  I love this recipe!

This concept of a recipe is great but I changed it to my liking and we think it is so much better this way. I saute the ground beef and onions and when browned I add our favorite barbecue sauce and then put into a baking dish and top with the mashed potatos in which I add about a teaspoon of cajun seasoning and just a pinch or two of crushed red pepper flakes for a little heat and it it wonderful. Definitely something you should try!

Great recipe!!  I made some substitutions...wanted to use up some things in the frig.  I added fresh carrots and celery to the saute, then used cream of mushroom soup.  Topped off with some garlic pesto cheese.  I loved it!

I have been looking for some time for an good and easy Shepherd's Pie recipe and this one fits the bill.  The thyme was a bit much for my family so I added a little Italian Seasoning the second time I cooked it.  Used Colby Jack cheese as well and it is terrific!  The frozen mashed potatoes out today taste as good as the real thing so, all in all, this is one terrific & easy recipe!  Thanks, Lisa!

Only a four star. Very good comfort food, but it doesn't have outstanding flavor.  Thyme is not what I'd choose for this.  I think next time I'll add basil and a bit of oregano instead.  I doubled the recipe because I was confident it would be at least a four star and that it could be frozen well.

I make numerous changes. Instead of soup I used frozen mixed vegetables.  I also zipped up the flavor a bit more with chili powder and garlic salt.  Garlic mashed potatoes on the and shredded pepper jack cheese really gave this a nice flavor!

Pretty good, but a few variations like putting mashed both on the bottom and top, and using tomato sauce and real veggies instead of canned soup, and egg on top to give it a nice color, would make it excellent

This was great, even though I had to use an entirely different soup than what the recipe calls for.  Let me explain...

This recipe calls for a can of condensed vegetable soup.  However, when you add this recipe to your shopping list, it magically decides to call that "1 can of vegetable stock" which is entirely different!

I emailed the staff about this glitch - hopefully it's fixed by the time you're reading this review!

Otherwise, it was great.  I ended up using this bacon potato soup I had, worked fine.

I use cream of mushroom soup and place of the vegetable soup and add a half teaspoon of onion powder, Salt and pepper to taste. Are used about 1/3 more potatoes than the recipe calls for. Turned out amazing!

We used a bit of garlic salt in the mashed potatoes and garlic & herb cheese (Cracker Barrel brand). The garlicky additions were wonderful. Overall we enjoyed this recipe and will definitely be making it again.

I made this last night & it was absolutely delicious! Although, I did make it completely different, lol. After browning the hamburger with the onion & celery I added: white beans, creamed corn, stewed tomatos, onion soup mix, green chilis & cream of mushroom soup. I did not use thyme or vegetable soup. I made my own mashed potatos to put on top and mixed some cheese into the potatos instead of topping it with cheese at the end. You really can throw anything you want in there. My boyfriend & I both agreed this was one of the best things I have made in awhile. Don't be afraid to experiment! Oh yeah and salt & pepper to taste (always).

My family loved this!  I used a hearty, thickened vegetable broth instead of soup and added the real vegetables in between.  Even when we had it as leftovers, the kids raved.

This recipe was good with modifications (thank you, Sworden!).  I really liked it, and my boyfriend thought it was good, but not great.  I added a clove of garlic to the hamburger, celery, and onions and cooked that on the stove.  I used vegetable soup.  I also added about half a can of green beans, half a can of corn, and -- this is SO important -- 3 tablespoons of worchestire sauce.  Without the worchestire, this would be super bland.  I also added the 4-cheese Idahoan brand potatoes on top, which tasted great!  I only used one package, and it was barely enough to cover the top.  If you want a thick layer of taters, you should use 1 1/2 to two packages of potatoes.  Served this with cornbread, which was a great flavor combo.  I also used very lean ground beef to cut fat and so I didn't even have to strain the beef after cooking.  Will make this again.

Using suggestions from others: extra seasonings, black pepper, paprika, garlic, and substituting cream of mushroom soup, this was perfect for my picky husband, he doesn't like too many veggies so I added small cans of corn and green beans to meat mixture, it was great! I will make this again soon!

Just tried this last night and loved it!  I made a few modifications, which worked out wonderfully.  I used both a can of vegetable soup and a can of cream of mushroom soup -- the two flavors worked wonderfully together.  I also used sharp cheddar cheese; I shredded about 1 cup of the cheese and mixed it into the mashed potatoes before baking.  Then sprinked some more on top toward the end.

This recipe is awesome!  I read that many people changed the soup from vegetable to mushroom, but I decided to stick with the recipe.  The soup added great flavor to the beef mixture.  I added corn, green beans, 3 T of Worcestershire sauce (brings out the flavor), 1 clove of garlic when cooking meat. Instead of ground beef, I used ground turkey.  I also used Idahoan Four Cheese potatoes and omitted the thyme, since I'm not a big fan of thyme.  It was amazing!  Definitely will be making this again! Thank you so much for this recipe!
Update....I tried it with cream of mushroom soup, and it still tastes wonderful.  Definitely add the Worcestershire; without it, it's bland.

the dish was very good, not as thick as i thought it was suppost to be. I made some changes to the recipe, instead of thyme i put italian seasoning and added minced garlic (1tsp.) and some corn. Taste great and will make it again but with small changes.

I changed the recipe based on other recommendations, plus because I try to make it healthy, (canned soups are high in sodium)..this is what I changed: I used 2 lbs beef and added 1 clove garlic, and increased onions to 2/3 cup.. I added 1 1/2 tsp. worchestershire , and 1/2 tsp peri peri to meat. I don't use canned soup, so I used "Imagine"  organic creamy tomato & basil soup..(about 2 cups for 2 lbs. beef)... I also added some frozen peas to beef mixture I added the soup to the meat / veg mixture in the frying pan and mixed together. We like lots of potatoes, so I used 6 rather huge ones... I also omitted the cheese, as we are lactose interolerant. Yummy!!!!

This was a good Shepherd's pie recipe.  Not great- but solidly "good".   My son, however, loved it and is begging me to make it again.  I think maybe adding some minced garlic would liven it up a bit.  Of course, I add garlic to almost anything.  THanks for sharing.  I'll be making this again.

This was pretty darn good. Easy and semi-quick to make. I didn't have condensed soup so I used regular, drained it and added cream of celery to it to thicken. So i thought it was darn good, plus topped with cheese was really good. My fam liked it.

All three of us (including the 2-year-old) gobbled this right up! I was forced to modify it because I could not find condensed vegetable soup, even after searching three different stores. So I made a double batch and used one can each of condensed broccoli and condensed celery soup. Because I doubled it to solve the soup problem, I made two pies. We ate one that night, and I left one without cheese and put it in the fridge for later in the week. When it was time to cook the second, I just used the same time and temperature, adding the cheese as directed by the original recipe. The second pie was just as good as the first! I will definitely make this again.

Wow--this was a great family meal.  Like others, I added asparagus, carrots, and celery, and used generic cream of mushroom soup.  Next time, I will try to have time to add fresh herbs, but the dried thyme was fine.

This is great, I agree with others though, it's a fantastic base, but you have to add some things to make it awesome.  I kind of like that about it though!

use cream of mushroom soup instead of vegetable soup.  add some garlic.  use mixed vegetables - especially add corn, even creamed corn.

This recipe had no flavor.  I even made it a second time and doctored it up with salt, pepper, and assorted herbs and it was still tasteless.  We also didn't care for the texture.  We do like highly seasoned food so this is obviously not the recipe for us.  Those that like their recipes bland will probably enjoy this.

Yum - perfect for a fall/winter meal.  I doubled and used 1 can cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of celery. Also added a small bag of petite mixed veggies.  I went to reach for my Worcestershire, and I FORGOT I was all out.  Would have added the perfect kick as some other reviews have mentioned.  Will add it next time.

Very good but I did change it up by adding sour cream to my mashed potatos and chicken broth to replace milk and using cream of muchroom soup to replace the veggie soup. I also added fresh mushrooms, frozen peas and corn. It was a hit. Thanks for the idea.

I tried this last night & even my picky kids had seconds!  I did change it to use up stuff I had open in the fridge.  Plus, I was out of onion, celery (my kids won't eat that) & veg. soup.  So, after browning & draining the meat, I did the following:

Added 2 T. (may have been a bit much) of Roast Seasoning -- I think onion soup would have been ok too.

Added 1 can (drained) of mixed veggies & 1/2 can of tomato sauce (the sauce was leftovers -- so you probably could add the whole can).

Added 1 c. of pinto beans (drained & rinsed) -- again these were leftovers I had in the fridge.  Gave the mix some real heartiness.

Added about 1/4 c. of beef broth (again -- had an open can in the fridge) -- just to get the consistency right.  Then added a few dashed of worcestershire sauce until it was just right.

I made homemade mashed potatoes with sour cream & topped it with jack cheese (again, all I had).

It was great!

I accidentally bought a can of Campbell's condensed vegetable soup with the alphabet letters, and it worked perfect.  I'm making it for dinner tonight because it is back by popular demand.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Great recipe for limited time!  I was able to put this all together in pretty much 30 minutes!!  Sauteed onion and celery with a bit of salt.  Then cooked the meat with thyme, garlic and paprika.    Threw in a half bag of mixed veggies by Libby (carrots, peas, string beans, etc), and warmed them up in the skillet with the meat, etc. Drained. Used instant potatoes. Placed  into a glass dish and topped with a mixed blend of shredded cheese.
Taste was fine and having more relax time was great!!  Will use this again!!!! ;)

I followed some of the other reviews suggestions and swapped out the soup for condensed cream of mushroom, and used canned corn instead of celery (more due to what was in the house than anything else) Very good!
UPDATED: I have also made this exactly according to the recipe and my family gobbled it down just as quick!

I really learned to like the taste of thyme after trying this recipe.  I used condensed chicken soup instead and it was great.  It is a heavy meal, so you don't need to make anything else with it.  It reheats great.

This was a good basic recipe, I used packaged mashed potatoes and it worked fine.  I thought the condensed soup was odd but it tasted great with the ground beef.

Everyone loved this.  I did eliminate the thyme and added salt and pepper to taste.  Used red potatoes with peeling.  Mashed with 1/2 butter, 1/2 milk and garlic powder.  I have added this to my collection.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was good.  I added mushrooms and garlic when browning the beef as well as spices (garlic salt, parlsey, beef seasoning, etc.) as well as a can of mixed vegetables to the soup mix.  I could only find vegetable soup with small noodles, but this worked fine.  I also dressed up my potatoes with garlic and parm. cheese.  This turned out really good.

Very good recipe.  I substituted mild pork sausage for the beef and used leftover mashed potatoes.  Excellent comfort food, I will make this one again. Could be improved by a bit more seasoning and maybe a can of green beans.   Thank you.

My family gobbled this recipe up!  Very highly recommended and so easy!  I left out the onion and celery, and substituted garlic & onion powder instead.  Also left out the thyme, and it tasted great.

I changed this up a bit.....onion flakes instead of onion, and celery salt instead of celery.  And I added a bit more Thyme. (I'm a dumper, not a measurer, so I don't know exactly how much Thyme I added.) This has become a family favorite.  I make it at least once a month.  We love it!

An authentic Shepherd's Pie is made with ground lamb not beef. (hence the 'shepherd') Cottage Pie is made with ground beef.

This is a very forgiving recipe - you can substitute many different things, based on what you have on hand.  I used ground turkey meat, and cream of chicken soup.  I also threw in all my leftover veggies.  It was a hit.

Very good. My wife said this was a true comfort food dish. I followed others advice and used mixed vegs and I used some garlic with the beef. I only had cream of mushroom soup and used that and it worked out very well. Easy, especially if you have leftover mashed potatoes.

This is a great recipe....I changed it a bit and thought it turned out fabulous!!!  We added fresh thyme and fresh basil, extra chopped garlic, chopped red pepper that I had in the freezer and of course 4 cups of mashed potatoes with sour cream added to them...they were a huge hit with my hubby and kids!  We sent an extra pan over to some friends in need and they said it was great too!  Thanks for the recipe!

Fixed this pie for the first time last night.  Based on the other reviews, I seasoned my ground beef well with Worchestshire, Montreal Steak seasoning, chopped garlic, celery and onions. I added Golden Mushroom soup instead of vegetable soup.  Then I added frozen peas that I quickly microwaved.  Added 4 cups of cooked, well seasoned instant mashed potatoes.  Covered with the Colby cheese, longhorn style.  The dish is simply delicious!  Thanks for the recipe Lisa!!

My family just pushed this meal around with the fork and even I have to admit it wasn't that appetizing.  I used more ground beef than called for hoping it would make the meal a little more filling, but that didn't help.

Great comfort food for cold weather!  The only vegetable soup I could find had macaroni noodles in it, so next time I may subsitute a different soup.  Good for leftovers too.

This was a very tasty recipe.  I did change it a bit though.  I used leftover steak, mushroom soup and marble cheese instead as that is what I had on hand.  It was really good, and I will make again, thanks!

I had never had sheperd's pie before, but this is so simple to make, I had to give it a try.  I omitted the thyme, and added canned corn.  Turned out good, my 1 year old loved it.  I must say though it is not something I would make for company it is not very nice to look at.

The first time I made this, I didn't like it at all.  I now know I hate the taste of thyme, plus there were way to many mashed potatoes with not enough meat and soup underneath.  Other than the thyme, it was VERY bland.  So... the second time I made it I added salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the meat, and used basil and oregano in the soup instead.  I also used one can of condensed vegetable soup as suggested, but added a can of Campbell's Salisbury Steak soup (which has lots of veggies in it) and removed the chunks of steak from it.  It's much better now, but still not great.  I'll keep working with it.

I substituted rosemary, basil, and tarragon for thyme and it worked well.   The only condensed vegetable soup I could find had alphabets in it.  And something about the taste of the processed soup didn't gel right.   I'm going to look into alternatives to using the soup and getting the same flavoring.   I'm thinking tomato paste and fresh veggies.

The vegetable soup made a nice addition to shepherd's pie.  I only added a small can of green beans for extra veggies.

I cooked 4 lg russet potatoes for 20 minutes in the Instant Pot, did a quick release and set them aside to cool a bit.
I washed the inner pot and set the IP to saute, cooking the extra lean ground beef, celery and onions as directed.  After draining the mixture I added a can of condensed vegetable soup but mine has no corn so I also added about 200g canned corn. I replaced the IP lid just to keep the contents warm then peeled the potatoes and put them into the kitchenaid mixer. I mixed at 1 for about 45 seconds.
Some thinly sliced old cheddar was placed on top of the potatoes after they went onto the meat mixture I had placed into an 8" square pyrex pan.
Twenty minutes later and voila! 
Salt and pepper were added by individuals as was butter.
Very easy, tasty and quick.

Delicious! Great way to use left over roast beef. Add any veggies you like...which I had leftover broccoli, carrots & onions. Broccoli not our favorite, but it was still quite tasty. Used instant mashed potatoes to make a quicker dish and it was fine. Husband has eaten the dish twice as for lunch.  Will make again when I have leftover roast beef.

I love shepherd's pie. In my specific case, I had a lot of leftover beef vegetable soup I had made. Rather than keep eating it as a soup, I decided to use it to make this. I just drained the meat & vege's. I like the addition of creamy Cream of Mushroom soup. Used 1/2-N-1/2 for potatoes.  Plain cheddar cheese, as that's what I had. Excellent, quick dish. We loved it.

Weâ€™ve made this for years in my family. 2 cans of vegetable soup, and try velveeta inside. The layers are like this: soup and burger mix on bottom, green beans (or veggies of choice) next, velveeta cheese on top of the veggies, the mashed potatoes on top. Yummy with a nice cheesy sauce!

I've made this many times,  but we didn't care for the vegetable soup so I now use a can of condensed cream of mushroom with 1/4 can of water and add about a cup of mixed frozen vegetables (peas, carrots, corn and green beans - no need to thaw them - they cook to a nice non-mushy consistency).  Satisfying and filling on a cool winter's day!

I have been searching for YEARS for this recipe since losing my nearly identical one when I lost my cookbook in a fire. I was SO happy and excited to find it and one other nearly identical recipe from my book! This will finally, once again, become a regular dinner go to in my house.

For those who don't know what Colby Longhorn is, you must not live in the midwest :)     Longhorn is a style of American Colby cheese defined by its round, long, orange cylindrical shape. When cut for packaging it resembles a moon or shalf moon. It is made from cow's milk rather than sheep's or goat's milk. The flavour can be anything from mild to sharp but it is usually a Colby or Jack cheese.

Turned out really good! I had never made, or eaten a Shepard's pie before so I was  a little  skeptical. I did tweek the recipe a bit. I didn't have any veggie soup, so I used a couple of cans of cream of mushroom that I had on hand. I didn't use any thyme, the kids don't like onions so those are out, I don't eat celery so that had to go. I did throw in a can of peas, corn, and green beans. For the cheese I used Mexican blend shredded, and a little mozzarella.  Everyone in the house loved it.  A wonderfully flexible recipe!

Good cottage pie. I liked the thyme, but Colby cheese is not the best choice - I prefer good old English Cheddar.

I hate the Thyme and the vegetable soup.  This is bland, and does not much flavor other than the strong taste of Thyme.

This is an excellent dish when you get sick of tacos and hamburgers.  I made it back in January and my family scarfed it down.  I used flour in mine though.

I also used the cream of mushroom, and I added some frozen mixed veggies(carrots/peas/corn) and some worstershire and fresh garlic too. With these simple changes it's a 5 star!

My husband loves this one! The substitutions I made are condensed Cream of Chicken instead of Vegetable, herb seasonings instead of Thyme and added Sea Salt and a little Cayenne pepper to give it a kick.

We were not crazy for this Shepherd's Pie. I added 1/4 cup chopped carrots, 2 garlic cloves and some worchestershire to the meat but it was still bland for us. My husband ended up putting hot sauce on his.

This recipe is so simple to make and so good!  I doubled the recipe and added cream of mushroom soup (with garlic) and frozen veggies thawed in place of the condensed veggie soup.  I also had to double the onions because I did not have any celery, so I also added celery salt to the beef while it was cooking.  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

I think this recipe was just okay, as is. Could be because I accidentally bought a can of vegetable soup with alphabet pasta, which made the filling a little thicker than suggested.  Oops.  It seemed a little bland.  I would try this again, with additions as suggested by several other reviewers, including corn, and maybe a second can of soup to make it a little thinner.  I will say this was very quick and easy to make.

As another reviewer has stated, this recipe is one definately where anything goes. I didn't have a can of condensed soup on hand, so I added some carrots to the mix and heated it with the meat, celery and onion.  Also, I am a big fan of garlic, so I added three minced cloves in as well.  After heating, I added 3/4 C of garlic spaghetti sauce, a can of green beans and a can of peas. I didn't have dried thyme, so I substituted ground thyme. Finally, I added salt to bring out the flavors.

I thought this was very good and I don't like Shepherd's Pie. I used the cream of mushroom soup and I thought it was excellent. I had a bag of shredded taco cheese so I used that for the topping and it was great! Thanks so much - I'll surely make this again.

This recipe was so easy to make!  I used cream of mushroom soup and a can of tomato sauce to give it some flavor.  I added a can of corn, some basil, oregano and garlic.  I also added a layer of cheese between the beef and the mashed potatoes.

This was a great quickie meal.  I used 2 cans of the Campbell's Chunky 
Vegetable w/Beef soup (drained w/a little reserved juice for the mix) instead of the condensed soup as stated.  My hubby says it would have been better if I had just used vegetable soup without the beef.

This was a great cold night dinner meal.  My family loved it!  I doubled the recipe and thank goodness I did.  I had very little leftovers. Next time - I would increase the green beans and maybe add more veggies - more fiber, more filling and I used low fat cheddar.  Delicious!

I thought this recipe was kind of bad. The leftovers went uneaten.  The recipe I had used before this is way better, I just thought I would try to follow a recipe for it and didn't turn out to my liking.  But it seems like lots of people like it, maybe they know something I don't.

Added cream of corn (only about 1/8 cup), 1/16 cup of canned peas, & about a 1 tsp. of jarred garlic.  I had just opened up a can of cream of celery so used that instead of vegetable soup. Also instead of Colby, used American cheese. I just had some that needed used up and decided to give this a try since I didnâ€™t have Colby. These substitutitions were for 2 servings. I had some left over cream of corn and added about Â¼ cup of that. The only thing I shouldnâ€™t had done is adding the cream of corn, it caused the mashed potatoes not to firm up during cooking. I'll definately try this again without using the cream of corn of course.

THIS WAS SOOO yummy-----BUt----my husband did NOT like the thyme taste to it...next time I will cut the thyme by a third....it overpowered the dish too much I felt.  Also, I added corn to the dish, as when I looked at the soup being added it seemed that there were not enough veges inside.  I grew up with an Australian mom that made REAL shepherd's pie (lamb) and I was really craving all the veges I remember it having inside.  It didn't seem to matter that I added more...it actually enhanced it.  I will DEFINATELY make this again.  YUM! (I also added more cheese on top----YUMMY!)

Yummy!!! Everyone loved this in my family except my picky 4 1/2 year old son. Even my 3 year old loved it!!! I think next time I might double the recipe because we barely had enough for a family of 5 [2 adults and 3 kids].

Terrific.  I used "Momma's Mashed Potatoes" from the allrecipe site and added 2 or 3 ounces of cream cheese to the potatoes.  Delicious!  I like this with vegetable soup, but will try other soups when I prepare it again.  Not fancy, but easy to prepare.  It's classic comfort food.

I do not like veg soup, but I made this to see if I could like it with the additional items. I did not like this dish too well, but only because of the soup. I did give it 5 stars because I have 3 very picky children who do not like vegtables. All three of my children loved this dish and asked for seconds, so because of that this recipes wins me over. Any recipe that has veg and gets my kids to eat it will be remade in my house. Thank you.

I have been making this recipe for years and everyone loves it. I use vegetarian vegetable soup. I never leave the thyme out because that is what makes it Shepherd's pie. In the true Irish version, thyme is a main ingredient.

I am not a big fan of this kind of meal, but my family is and they really liked it! Although I noticed many used different kinds of soups, I went ahead and used the veggie soup because I had it in the house. I think it might be fun to experiment with different kinds of soups and even the corn in the future..maybe next time cream of mushroom or something. I also omitted the thyme, only because we are not a big fan of the flavor of thyme. 

Thanx for the recipe, and I will be keeping this handy in "my recipe box" and will be making it again!

This was a big hit with us.  I modified a little for our tastes by using Old Bay Seasoning, and garlic powder with chopped onion and green peppers while browning the meat.  I drained a can of pinto beans and spicy veg all, added the thyme and meat mixture.  Topped with instant potatoes for a time saver and nacho blend cheese.  My husband raved and insisted I write down the changes for the next time. Thanks, Lisa, for a wonderful one dish meal.

Tasted even better the next day. Definately a good meal to do "the night before". I added a can of corn and used Cream of Mushroom soup instead of vegtable soup. I also added a bag of mixed veggies. Turned out great!

OK.  If you want a recipe that your husband will actually request all the time...this is it!  It is so easy to throw together (well except the potatoes, but that is was makes it good! real mashers)  I have made it about 4 different times in the past 6 weeks, everytime making it a little different! (add rotel, add vegis, add Adobo, it's fun to be imaginative with this recipe!)
Thanks!

I'm not a fan of Shepherd's Pie, but my husband and daughter absolutely love it.  They both really like this recipe with a slight modification.  They both thought it needed more corn, so I add a small corn of whole corn in the last step.

Wonderful recipe! We did alter it a bit, though. We used low-salt crackers and dehydrated onions and mushrooms. Great taste, but there was too much sauce on top. My husband usually likes everything drenched in sauce and even he thought there was too much. Next time we will cut the sauce in half. Thanks for the keeper recipe:)

This was good but still needs tweaking.  Like others, I used cream of mush. soup instead of vegetable soup, green pepper instead of celery, and I added a can of corn and some fresh garlic.  It tasted a lot like creamed beef with potatoes on top.  Next time I'll try another soup instead:  golden mushroom, tomato, or even condensed beef stock.  Used cheddar on top because it was all I had, and still tasted good.

So easy! I use "store bought" mashed potatoes.
For a little more pizzazz, add a can of crisp corn with jalapeno peppers.

Not too bad!  Easy and good. We're not too fond of the texture of celery but like the taste so we used celery seed instead. Will make this one again.

I thought this recipe was so - so.  It was super easy to make, and the clean up was minimal. However, I thought it only tasted okay and the kids went to bed without eating.  It reminded me of a church meal, edible but not all that great.

This recipe was a great time saver, I added some frozen vegetables, and instead of using ground beef I used steak,and for an added time saver I used the small whole onions, instead of chopping,and also used instant mashed potatoes no-one even knew! My husband loved this. As for my child, well he went to bed hungry.

This recipe does have a down home classic flavour.  I did add a layer of Swiss cheese prior to topping with the Potatoes.  Also, put in some chopped fresh parsley.  8 servings was not enough for our family!

This was a very easy recipe. I used the vegetable soup with alphabet letters and I found the flavour to be good. I added extra precooked mixed vegetables, which I think was a necessary addition. The thyme contributed a lot of flavour, so if you don't care for the taste of thyme, add less or leave it out completely and add another appropriate spice.

This was a very quick and easy recipe! I made instant potatoes to shorten the preparation, added some chili powder to the meat. I would increase the hamburger to 1 and half pounds as it wasn't meaty enough for my boyfriend. Very quick and easy! Thank you. We will be having this again.

This was very good. Next time I think that I will try ground turkey and fresh vegetables. Great submission Lisa, thanks.

My husband is a lover of Shephard's Pie and truly LOVED this one.  It was the easiest thing I've ever made, everyone loved it!  The more potatoes on top the better, for a square pyrex dish 4 or 5 small potatoes wasn't enough, Shephard's Pie is better with an inch thick layer of potatoes, I think.

I had used instant potatoes instead of real potatoes.  My whole family loved it.

You need to watch closely the amount of thyme.  Too much at all is WAY too much
