Finally an almond bread recipe that doesn't taste eggy!  Thank you!  I reduced the baking powder to 1 tsp but will try it with 2 tsp next time.  I used 2 whole eggs and 4 egg whites instead of 4 whole eggs and 4 egg whites.  I added 4 TBSP vinegar to the egg whites after beating.  When the vinegar and baking powder combine right before baking, it creates a chemical reaction "rise" similar to how bread normally rises.  The bread was moist and didn't crumble like another recipe I've tried in the past.  Thank you!

Awesome recipe, loved that it was half egg whites vs whole eggs. Can definitely taste the egg but not as much as other recipes! I didn’t have xantham powder so I substituted with Psyllium Husk Powder which is part of gluten free recipes. Texture and taste was similar to cornbread. It was a little salty for my taste but will use less salt next time. Will save this recipe for future use! Thank you :)

just thought I would throw my 2 cents in on Bridget's comment. You do not need to add an acid as this calls for baking powder and not baking soda. decent low carb recipe but hard to replace real bread.

Did not like the texture and tasted like eggs too much. My husband liked the texture and enjoyed a few sandwiches.
