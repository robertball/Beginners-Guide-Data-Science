I have used this recipe for a couple years now and love it everytime!  I have friends that have asked me for it as well.  The only problem I have is using only a 1/4 cup of beer and then the rest gets wasted because I always start the marinade in the a.m.  So, I have learned to make a large batch of the marinade.  I freeze it with my chix breasts and also bags of cut-up peppers for my future fajitas.  I just pull it out in the a.m. to thaw and it's ready to grill by the time I get home.

I thought this marinade was really good.  I added a little more of all the spices and a couple more cloves of garlic, marinated 2 chicken breasts (cut up) in the fridge for about an hour.  Then I cooked the chicken, some onion and red pepper IN the marinade.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I've had better, but all in all a good recipe and I would probably make again.  Thanks!!

My husband and son thought it was good. I think it would be a good marinade for chicken, then I would have given it 5/5, actually I wanted to give it 4 1/2 out of 5. It was tangy with the citrus flavors. As for a fajita, I'm used to having fajita's for beef, chicken and shrimp with the usual fajita flavor(like my favorite resturant). It would be better in a category for just citrus marinade for chicken.

I followed the recipe exact. I let my meat marinate for an hour. With lime juice, you have to watch it or it'll cook your chicken. This was good, but I feel it could have used a bit more cumin. And something else I couldn't put my finger on. I'd use this again and double the spice.

This was so good.  It was hard to part with a 1/4 cup of my beloved beer but I followed exact.  I cut my chicken into strips before marinating and then grilled them.  I would grill them if possible. I will definately use this marinade again.

Thank you for the great recipe, even though I changed it quite a bit!  That's partly what's so great about this website -- I'm learning to use other peoples' experience and trust my instincts too.  I didn't even measure, used no beer, squeezed half a lemon, threw in some white wine Worcestershire, a bit of flavored vinegar, oil, cumin, brown sugar, and of course cayenne, black pepper and sea salt. Next time I'll use the beer too.  Used the ziplock bag and mostly frozen breast tenders -- so easy!  It made such great fajitas! Thank you!

Very good. I grilled my chicken and moistened the chicken with the marinade each time I turned it. I will use this recipe again.

This was a great marinade.  However it works much better on chicken than steak.  I  will definitely make this again but suggest marinating overnight.  Thanks for sharing.  Yummy.

My fajitas came nice and juicy! Cooked them on the gas grill, also sliced peppers and onions and put them in a foil pack with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Heated the tortillas on the grill too. Delish!!

DEEEELICIOUS!!! This recipe is perfect as is. No alterations are necessary, IMHO. Although my hubby wasn't as willing to give this a superb  rating, he didn't have any "real" complaints either.... His only comment was that our fajitas were a little "limey," but that's what I like most about this recipe! I recently misplaced my go-to fajita recipe and am glad to have found a very similar replacement (and it's just as "limey"). :) After reading several reviews, I determined that my husband's opinion seems to be the dominant opinion on here also. Not wanting to cross-contaminate (i.e. marinating veggies w/ raw chicken), I made 2 batches of marinade - 1 for my cut-up chicken (I purchased a pkg. of tenderloins on sale) & another for my veggies (sliced Vadilla onion & red / green bell peppers). I marinated everything for 2 hrs. and used a sm. amount of the marinade (from veggies) to saute in, but I don't think the latter was necessary. I used Corona lite in my marinade w/ excellent results. For a fun presentaton, I preheated fajita pans (500 degree oven for ~ an hr.) to get a nice "sizzle" effect just like they do at authentic Mexican restaurants (or Chili's for that matter...). NOTE: The acidity of lime juice will break down (i.e. cook) your chicken. Two hrs. MAX is SPOT ON, allowing just enough time for the marinade to do it's magic. :)  Served w/ Mexican Rice III (ALANSMOM), guac / chips & Mike's hard margaritas, this was an EXCELLENT meal! Thanks for sharing, Olivia! :-)

As written, this is almost tasteless even when marinated for over 3 hours.  Notice that a lot of the reviewers who rated this highly made changes to give it taste. 

Flavor is extremely thin, a hint of lime, a hint of Worcestershire sauce, but everything else is lost.

I was looking for a good chicken fajita marinade that was fairly simple but had authentic taste.  THIS IS IT!  The end product has a very nice citrus flair from the lime juice combined with a nice smoky flavor from the cumin.  We marinated for about 3 hours the first batch and it was pretty good.  We put the extra chicken breasts in the used marinade and marinated overnight and they were UNBELIEVABLE!  Try this, you'll love it!

Good, but a little too sweet for us. The second time I made it I added a little chili powder and cayenne to balance out the sweetness.

Very good - needed more "heat" for us. I did add both chili powder and hot pepper sauce for our tastes. Grilled the chicken in my grill pan in a little of the marinade-then grilled onion and pepper strips in the same juices.  The vegetables were unbelievable!

Take this review with a grain of salt as I altered a bit.  I felt still justified A) if I fessed up and B) because what I am really commenting on is the brown sugar and cilantro which I think is key to this recipe.  I used more and also added quite a bit of various vinegars which I think it needed but the sweet cilantro-y flavor came through.

I made this for a family birthday celebration. It was very easy to put together. The flavors were so rich and fantastic. I'll never buy packaged fajita marinade again now that I have this great recipe. Everyone raved about how great the fajitas tasted. Thanks for sharing the recipe Olivia!!

I thought it seemed like a bit too much lime juice in the marinade, so I just used the juice of two very small limes.  I'm glad I did that, because even so the lime flavor was quite strong.  I let it marinade about 4 hours, then cooked in and let it simmer in some mole sauce.  Served with Mexican rice.  Delicious!

This recipe was a big hit tonight at dinner, and it was so easy to make. The family is on the P90X fitness/nutrition plan, and I wanted to surprise them with Chicken Fajitas!

I used thin-sliced chicken breast, placed them in a zip-lock bag with all the marinade ingredients (excluding the beer.) Then I sliced up strips of green & red peppers, but those in Ziploc steam bags. (easy & fat free instead of frying)and ready in just minutes. Marinated the chicken for close to 3 hours.

Served on "whole wheat" torillas, low-fat sour cream and fresh store bought salsa on the side, plus a homemade guacamole dip as well. Added a dish of Whole Wheat Tortilla Chips as well.

I got rave reviews from my husband & adult sons. They want me to make again and again....

Thank you for sharing this marinade recipe. I'll also try this recipe with steak fajita's for a change as well.

I felt so good tonite with all my family's compliments!

Fantastic! With just a few tweaks, this is a really great recipe! I doubled the amount of cumin, added a few dashes of cayenne pepper, chili powder, and a green chili hot sauce, and then added one tablespoon of cider vinegar.  I only had one hour to let it marinade, but it was still extremely flavorful! My husband and I couldn't get enough of this! Thank you!

The flavors in this were great.. except the Worcestershire sauce. I like Worcestershire, but it was all I could taste, and I didn't find that it worked well with the other flavors. I also found it a little sweet. I think, even if I were to omit the Worcestershire and brown sugar, I wouldn't be chomping at the bit to make this again; it was underwhelming.

I modified this a little by adding some chopped scallion and a dash of red pepper flakes, and didn't stick to the amounts given (I just eyeball and go by the amounts we like), but I have to say, it turned out excellent!!  Hubby said we should start doing fajitas once a week!

The marinade had an excellent flavor and my husband and 11 year daughter loved it.  My daughter had it for dinner and said it heated up great the next day for lunch.  Grilled the chicken until almost done than added it to sauteed veggies with the marinade and heated for about 5 minutes.  The chicken was very moist.  It wasn't as intense as we normally like so the only thing different I would do is leave it to marinade longer than the stated time - just our preference.  P.S. Only had bottled lime juice and dried cilantro in the house and they worked great.  Will be using this from now on.  Thanks Olivia!

I marinated the chicken for a couple of hours. The only change I made was lemon instead of lime juice, because my limes weren't very juicy. The chicken turned out super moist and tender and tasty. Thanks!

This was a great marinade except just a little too sweet. Next time I will definitely eliminate the brown sugar and add a little bit more lime.  I also cooked my chicken and the vegetables in the marinade which tasted amazing.

My favorite thing for fajitas now! I add a little balsamic and cut the sugar down, and sometimes add a little red pepper flake for spice, but it is amazing as written too. Very cilantro-y. I usually add a bit of the marinade to my peppers and onions too. Can't get enough!

I cook a lot o fajitas and I'm going to make this my standard marinade. Good balance of flavours and got a thumbs up from the whole family. I cut up my chicken first, marinated it in a baggie for a couple of hours and cooked it in the frying pan. Ate with homemade guac and some corn salsa. Worked just great. Bbq next time if its not raining.

I didn't use beer or brown sugar because I didn't have them and this still turned out great! I made fajitas for a group of girls and they ate up every last bite! I even made a separate portion for a vegetarian friend and marinated the veggies - she left with the recipe!

This was a really good marinade for chicken, but it was a little to lime-y for my tastes. I would suggest halving the amount of lime. I let my marinade for ~10 hours. I sauteed onions, green bell peppers and the chicken in a skillet (like other people said they did in other reviews), but it wasn't really like fajitas that you get at Mexican restaurants. Overall, good marinade for chicken.

WOW.  This was good.  Flavors meld well and are nice and clean.  I actually marinaded the chicken for a full day, not intentionally.  I cut them into nice pieces and sauted them in a skillet with peppers and onions.  I added a bit more cumin than the recipe called for.

I made these changes: upped the garlic to 3 cloves, used 1 tsp of cumin, 1 tsp chili powder, and 1/2 tsp of liquid smoke.  It tasted good, but not for fajitas.  It needs spice.  In the future I would just use this as a chicken marinade, not for fajitas.

These were by far the best fajitas I have ever made! I followed the ingredients exactly except for the fact I eyeballed them instead of using measurements. . ( Which I do 99% of the time I cook anything) I used the fit and trim Purdue chicken breasts, because my husband and I are both trying to loose 30 pounds. Which is why I chose this recipe. Its so low cal. I used Michelob Ultra Lime Cactus beer. We grilled the chicken, and I sauteed the peppers with an olive oil spray, paprika, garlic, and chipotle, and served it on a whole wheat tortilla. My kids and my husband and I loved this, and will make it again!

This is my 2nd time in a month making this marinade, 1st for fajitas and today just for grilled chicken, its delicious!!!  I do not have cumin on hand but other than that I follow everything to a T.  I make it in the morning and put it in a shaker bottle in the fridge and when I go to the fridge I give it a lil shake all day long (I am wondering if this could stay in the fridge for a few days or possibly be frozen in ice cube trays?).  I marinade the chicken for 3 hours. I do add some srircha (sp) to it, for some kick and wow this is awesome!!!  Use salt to bring out all the great flavors, its essential!  Thanks for a great recipe, I LOVE IT!!

OMG, this was wonderful.  thanks.  I didn't feel like opening a beer, though, so I substituted some tequila.  Sliced the chicken before marinating it and fried it with onions and bell peppers.  Served it on fresh flour tortillas (actually easy to make!).  Kids and hubby loved it!

I thought this marinade was fabulous.  I probably used 1/2 cup beer instead of 1/4 cup, a little more spices and let it soak for 4-5 hours.  My family loved it (and they are NOT easy to please).  I'm even thinking about using it for a marinde for BBQ chicken.  I WILL use it again and I have passed it on to all my BBQ friends. Carol, Allen Park, MI

What a fabulous marinade! I made it exactly as written, but had to use half "fake" lime juice (the kind that comes out of a little plastic lime) for half of the lime juice called for because my limes were so dry. Everything else stayed the same. 3 hours was plenty of time for the flavors to soak through. I served this on corn tortillas with all of the fixings. So so good!

Sadly, my kids now insist we always eat in for fajitas . . . better than their fav restaurant they say ;-)  So I guess this is a keeper!  Super easy to prepare with great flavour (but giving up that 1/4 cup of beer . . . ).  Next time I do it I'm going to save a bit of marinade apart to marinade the chicken as I grill it.

We used this marinade recipe to make about 15 lbs of chicken for a housewarming party.  Everyone loved it.  We used the leftovers to make chicken nachos and they were delish too!

Super easy, really tasty recipe, with ingredients most of us already have in the cupboard. Impressed everyone and made me look like a pro cantina chef. I found it's better with a longer marinade, at least 12 hours.

Very good marinade.  I left out the cilantro, as cilantro cane be very overpowering.  I marinated a yellow onion and red pepper with the chicken.

This marinade made a tasty chicken for on top of a Mexican salad.  The chicken was very juicy and VERY flavorful - the only minor complaint is that it had an overpowering lime flavor - next time I would use less lime juice, or dilute it a little with something else.

I follwed the recipe exactly, marinating the chicken breasts for 3 hours.  It had good flavor but not great, I will make this again but marinade it much longer

This marinade made my chicken very tender and juicy.  The flavor was light and delicious but I felt that it needed a little more "oomph".  Maybe some more cumin and some onion powder would have done the trick.  I will definately try this again with a few adjustments.

This marinade is quick, cheap, and easy. Has a fresh taste instead of that salty out of the bottle taste. My whole family ate this up. I also let my veggies soak this up. Spectacular!

Very disappointing, and I followed this recipe to the T. We could definitely taste the lime, but not the chili, cumin and other flavorings we thought would make the chicken really zingy. This one goes in the trash for me.

I really liked this recipe, it made for a nice change. I used a thin cut chicken breast and cut it up before marinading for 1 hour, then I put foil on the top rack of my gas grill and cooked it that way. It was so tender and had a nice flavor!  Will use again and recommend to friends.

Very Good!!! but I tripled it and used it with chicken, steak and shrimp. I split 2/3 of it into 3 bags and left to marinate in the fridge. I drained tha mariande then cooked the meats, with the 1/3 fresh marinade instead of what the meat had soaked in.

I did enjoy this recipe, but felt it needed as others have said more zing. Next time I will add some soy sauce, more cilantro and maybe even white vinegar.

Very good recipe!  I doubled the ingredients for the marinade.  As I made this on a 25 below zero winter night in Chicago, I cooked the chicken indoors in a skillet.  I added onions and green pepper strips and the marinade once the chicken was cooked thru. Boiled the marinade and cooked until the onions and pepper strips were cooked.  Delicious!

This was  a great recipe!! Never before had I made fajitas soI was thrilled at how these turned out.  I used a dark beer (it's all I had) and I did not have lime juice ( I thought I did) so I used lemon juice.  Next time I will make sure I use lime juice.

We did shrimp and chicken but I only marinated the shrimp briefly to keep them from getting chewy. Yum, big hit with my 20 something kids. I used Corona and did use generous amounts of cumin and some chili powder bc we like some kick. These aren't a spicy variety but are flavorful none the less. Nice and tender. I also marinated the veggies in a seperate bag.

I added a little oregano and chili powder, about 1t of salt, and some pepper.  Marinated for 5 hours or so and grilled the chicken.  This turned out very well - will definitely make again.  Thanks!

Only change I made was 1 tablespoon oregano in place of the cilantro (husband doesn't like cilantro). We enjoyed it and will make again!  I might add some more spice like other reviewers suggested (hot sauce, chili powder, etc.).

I actually thought this was pretty tasty and easy.  I grilled my chicken and thinly sliced.  I didn't have lime juice, so I just put in Bud Light Lime for the beer and lime juice portions...LOL...and it turned out tasting just fine!  Next time I will try with actual lime juice, but I would definitely make this again.  Thanks!

This is one of the best fajita marinades ever. I also use it for beef and grilled shrimp. My kids love chicken tenders marinated in this, then grilled. Fantastic recipe!!

This has become my go to fajita marinade for a couple years now! Amazing flavour combo! I don't usually measure the ingredients, just eyeball it. Thanks for submitting this!

Delicioso! I didn't have beer but decided to substitute ginger ale. My husband also didn't like cilantro, so I substituted oregano, as suggested by another cook. I also used lemon juice instead of lime, because that was what I had on hand. I marinated the meat for 2 1/2 hours, removed carefully the chicken and seared on a grill pan. It smelled so good cooking! Then I used 1/2 of the bag of frozen red/yellow/green peppers (Trader Joe's) and sliced red onions. After cooking the chicken, I removed from the pan, added the vegetables and poured the marinade on them. Turned the grill pan on high for a few minutes, then lowered to medium-high for about 3 more minutes, added the chicken for a minute, then lowered the burner to low. Heated the soft tortillas and dished the mixture inside, sprinkled some sharp cheddar on top, wrapped and served. My husband said it was "superb!" I used 2 chicken breasts sliced into pieces. It made 5 medium wraps. Thanks so much Olivia. We loved it!

We loved this recipe.  I made chicken and flank steak.  I will probably marinate the steak over night next time but it was a huge hit with my friends.  This is a definite marinate for our next fajita night.  Thank you for the recipe.  Loved it

EXCELLENT recipe!  It had a great flavor!  I didn't have any lime home, so used a little lemon juice instead and it still tasted great.  My family devoured it. I will definitely be making this again.   Thanks!

The marinade was pretty good. I added another tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce. Next time I think I will also add a little more garlic but I will use again :)

I made some adjustments to this recipe and we loved it.  I added oregano in place of the cilantro (can't stand it), 1 jalapeno, and 2-3 dashes of cayenne.  I added some of the marinade to the chicken, peppers, and onions when I cooked them.

Yum!  I had to pull myself away from tasting the marinade in order to get the chicken into it!  Doubled up on all spices and added freshly grated pepper.  I couldn't help poking a fork gently throughout each chicken breast.  I wanted to MAKE SURE this marinade got soaked up!  I also used the marinade while grilling the chicken.  Thanks!

This was fantastic!  I used Michelob w/ lime for the beer and marinated the sliced chicken for just over an hour.  Didn't grill- cooked in a saucepan with vegetable oil and leftover marinade.  My husband LOVED this!

This was not to my liking. I let it marinate for about 6 hours. It was so bitter from the combination of the lime and beer put together. I will not try this recipe again

not even "so-so".  I like a more "grilled" type chicken, and this was "wet".  Even with all the seasonings (I added extra at others advice) it was still very bland.

I did not care for this recipe. I'm not apt to make this again. Not very flavorful even after marinading for the designated time. I used Quorn Chik'n Tenders which can be used in place of chicken. Too sweet for me - I kept having to doctor it up.

This was ok for me, the chicken was not as tasty as I would like it to be.  It needed more salt, but I guess if you have more if the other add ons for fajitas it would be better.

My husband really enjoyed this recipe, as did I!  This will be made many more times I'm sure!  I didn't have time to marinate this recipe, so I simply put the marinade in the frying pan, and fried the chicken in it until it was gone. Tasted awesome, and was quick this way!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I found this bland for my taste as written. I added extra cumin, some chili powder, and some tamarind powder (can get in Asian store) the tamarind gives it a little more tangy complexity. I also used garlic salt instead of regular salt. We loved it after those changes.

I've looked this recipe up so many times over the past several years I figured I should finally review it. It's definitely my go to for fajitas, and it freezes great too. I make this marinade and pour it over the chicken strips in a ziploc freezer bag and toss it into the freezer for a lazy dinner prep night. So great!

I know this was for chicken, but I marinated a couple boneless pork chops over night.  Then after grilling them, I sliced them up and made wraps with rice and cabbage mixed with lime juice, mayo, sour cream and smoky chili powder.  Next will be with chicken. But can be used with both. Turn out wonderful. Thanks!!

This was good but nothing exceptional; I think I might  have marinated too long or maybe overcooked the chicken though. I doubled the recipe, but only used 1/3 C fresh lime juice and then used Nellie's lime juice for the other 1/3 C so maybe that also brought the flavor level down a bit?
I did discover squirting fresh lime juice on the chicken after it was cooked really made a big difference in flavor though-- would do that to all the chicken next time! Might use again and add more garlic and a bit more salt and maybe some oregano.

It was an awesome marinade!! I made it for a "Fiesta" last night and they were a big hit. The night before, I made the marinade exactly as the recipe stated and started to marinade the tenders in a ziploc, but then, quickly realized that the lime juice might actually cook my tenders or make them chewy while they hung out in the fridge. I rinsed out the tenders, kept the marinade, and re-marinated them 3 hours prior to the party. I also added a few dashes of liquid smoke, oregano, chili powder, & more cumin. I made a separate marinade for my veggie friends and marinated slices of green, red, and yellow bell peppers with sweet onions. The balance of the lime juice, garlic, & beer was perfect!! My husband cooked the veggies on an iron skillet on the grill and put the chicken on a flattop on the grill. I will definitely make these again. Thank-you reviewers for your modifications and Olivia for a great recipe!!

I used the marinade on chicken to make fajitas. I marinated the chicken for 5 hours and it was absolutely wonderful. The entire family loved it! The chicken was so tasty we wanted to eat it without all of the fajita fixings. Will definitely make this marinade again!

Good marinade.  It was sweet and I did want a bit more spice.  Next time I think I will add more cumin and maybe some liquid smoke.

It's a good base recipe, but I thought it lacked in fajita flavor and was a little too sweet.  So I added one tablespoon of liquid smoke, which made it perfect!

Made this tonight for dinner and it's two thumbs up!  Only marinated for about 45 minutes (chicken breasts) and then grilled.  Put the onions and red bell pepper in foil with evoo, salt and pepper and grilled too, and all was very tasty!  Prefer hands down over the packet of dry fajita seasoning.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe, even my picky kids loved it.  Used white wine instead of beer since that's what I had on hand.  Sliced the chicken before marinating, and 30 minutes was enough time.  Will use this recipe regularly - thank you!!

This came out perfectly when prepared exactly according to the recipe, and I have a hard time finding chicken recipes that come out well. I marinated the chicken for about 3 hours. I'm not a big fan of cilantro, but the 1 T called for in the recipe didn't give it an overpowering cilantro flavor. It's a keeper!

Just by the smell of the marinade alone I knew this was going to make some fine tasting chicken and it came thru with flying colors! Followed the recipe with the exception of the cilantro; not a fan. Family loved this one and I think next time I'd like to try this with a nice piece of cod. Yum and thank you Olivia!
