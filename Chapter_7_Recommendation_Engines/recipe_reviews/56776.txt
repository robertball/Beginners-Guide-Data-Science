This is a beautiful appetizer!  2 suggestions for preparation and presentation:  spray PAM on your knife when slicing the cheese (especially the cream cheese) and use a dark colored serving dish.  I used white and it would have been prettier on a different colored dish.

I make this recipe all the time. My family and friends always ask for it. I use bottled Italian Dressing istead of the oil and seasoning mixture. I just pour the dressing over the cheese, onions, pimento and the parsley. It is much easier and tastes the same if not better.

This was so good. I used a small cookie cutter to cut the cheddar into small stars and flowers. I out the cream cheese in the freezer for a little while before I cut it and had no problem. Everyone's favorite was the cream cheese it really soaks up the flavor of the marinade. It made for a really pretty presentation. I doubled the marinade and put some in the middle of the platter with a small spoon so they could pour extra onto their cheese.

WOW! What an awesome recipe! Excellent! Made exactly as written & served with Triscuit Garden Herb crackers (you need a sturdy cracker). 8oz blocks of cream cheese and cheddar cheese, alternating standing squares, filled the bottom of a bread loaf pan perfectly! The marinade was fantastic! My family raved about it! The only suggestion from several was to not use the squares, but to cut the cheese (sorry for the pun) into halves again for smaller rectangles and just layer the bottom of the pan with them, which can be spooned onto a cracker a littler easier! The squares were slightly awkward to maneuver onto a cracker along with some of the marinade. Overall though, they LOVED it! Thanks!

This is an outstanding recipe!!  I used soft mozzarella cheese and cheddar cheese--and was it ever good!!!  The marinate is also good (along with some of the cheese) as dressing on salad greens with some toasted almonds along with crusty bread on the side. Thanks for a great recipe.

I have made this 6 times now. People request it now! I have used sundried tomatoes in place of pimentoes. I like it both ways.

I made this for the first time and served it for Easter as an appetizer with crackers.  Rave reviews!  Everyone loved it.  I'm not fond or pimentos and did not have them on hand, so I substituted chopped sun-dried tomatoes, which gave the same visual effect, and went nicely with the other ingredients.  Yummy!

Wonderful recipe - everyone love it.  SUGGESTION: I make double the marinade and divide in baggies.  In addition to the cheeses I marinate mushrooms, steamed asparagus, steamed green beans and black olives.  By dividing the marinade in baggies you can marinate individually.  After marinating overnight, take each out of their bags (discard remaining marinade) and place on a platter.   Presentation is beautiful when placed properly.  I usually use roasted red peppers instead on pimentos simply because I usually have them on hand.

This was great!  It had a beautiful presentation; one note is that there is a LOT of marinade - you'll definetly want to re-plate before you serve.  Otherwise two thumbs up!

This is a great easy recipe.  Make sure the cream cheese is super cold before you slice it.  It makes a lot more than you would expect!!

This a very classy appetizer.  I prefer to use fresh mozzeralla or other mild cheeses.  Quite often the flavor of the cheddard will clash with the marinade.  You can dizzle the marinade over the cheese, over fresh cut vegetables or save for dipping bread in.

I had been looking for this recipe for quite some time and was pleased to find it.  I used white balsamic vinegar instead of white wine vinegar and it was amazing!  I didn't change anything else and it turned out fabulous.  Thanks!

I have been making this recipe for years--my family loves it.  A few tips:  Use ONLY Philadelphia brand cream cheese, cut in half long ways then put it in the freezer for about 15 minutes before cutting--if not, you will have a gooey mess.  If you are using dried parsley, use 1 1/2 tbsp.  You can sub red wine vinegar for white wine but white is best.

This was a huge hit as an appetizer at Thanksgiving.  I marinated it overnight and then poured off a little of the oil before plating it up.  Gorgeous presentation and great flavor.  I will definitely be making this again... maybe even as soon as Christmas Eve :)

Oh... and to those that were having trouble with slicing up the cream cheese, I would recommend using a piece of dental floss instead of a knife.

I give this 5 stars for taste but the prep and presentation needs some work.  The cream cheese tasted wonderful but was very difficult to work with.  I ended up with very tasty blobs.  The cheddar cheese didn't seem to absorb the marinade as well as the cream chesse.  I think when I make it again I will use other soft cheese like havarti, mozzerella or gouda.  And find a different, softer yellow cheese.  Any ideas?

WOW!  I had this for the first time at a Church function and it was fantastic.  I was a little leery of trying it after I read some of the reviews posted here (mainly problems with the cream cheese), but I didn't have any problem.  I used Meijer brand cream cheese (full fat brand), and put it in the freezer for a bit.  If you work quickly slicing it, there shouldn't be a problem.  The only thing I did differently was to use fresh basil instead of dry, and Splenda for the sugar.  I also poured off most of the oil before serving, and it was fantastic.  If you do pour off the oil, don't throw it away!!  We saved it and brushed it on the bread we used to make the Double Tomato Bruschetta on this site, which is also fantastic.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I have used this recipe for years and I'm in the middle of moving, and can't find it.  Luckily I found it here.  It is always a hit and a very nice looking appetizer.  I especially love to take it to a potluck when I have a busy schedule the day of the event and don't have time to be in the kitchen.  That way I make it the night before and it's ready to go when I am!  It is good with Triscuits or melba toast or pretty much any cracker!

Yummm...this is addicting! Looks good and tastes great. I always use mozzarella in place of cream cheese. Also, I tasted this after marinating for 6 hours and the vinegar was way too much. I recommend starting with half the vinegar, half of the oil, and tasting after a few hours and adding more if you think necessary.  I always just cube the cheese, arrange on a pretty platter, and cover with the marinade. Nice change from normal cheese dips and cheese balls. Thank you for sharing such a unique and yummy recipe! One of the absolute best recipes I've tried - ever.

This is absolutely fabulous!!  It is very pretty with the checkerboard cheeses!  The only thing I do different is I serve it right from the dish I marinated in.  People like the "juice"  I lost track of how many times I have been requested to make this!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very tasty. I found that the cream cheese was easy to cut if you wet the knife between slices.

Everyone wants this recipe!  I served it with thin slices of a crusty baguette.  If you assemble this in a disposable aluminum pan (pound cake size), before serving just cut open the side of the pan and slide onto a serving tray. All of the marinade ingredients remain on top of the cheese for a beautiful presentation. I had to substitute chives for green onions and rice vinegar for the wine vinegar, but it was still great.

This was such an easy recipe to make and so delicious!!  I took it to a NYE party and it was a HUGE hit!!  Even the pickiest of teenagers liked it!  Definitely a keeper!  A little advice...place the cream cheese in the freezer for a few minutes just to make it a little firmer for slicing.  Having a cheese slicer helped too!  Awesome recipe!

Awesome recipe! I only marinated for 3 hours and it still came out great! Next time I will cut the cream cheese into smaller pieces than the cheddar. I used mild cheddar cheese because I was scared sharp cheddar would overpower the marinade but I couldn't taste enough cheddar. If you like cheddar cheese, use sharp cheddar.

OUTSTANDING!! Took this to a party and it was gone in no time. Everyone kept asking who made this and what is the recipe. Thanks to a previous reviewer, who suggested putting the cream cheese in the freezer prior to slicing. This may have to be done several times while you are placing your cheeses. But that made the whole process a snap.
The recipe is perfect as is. But you do need to swap out another plate for serving, because of the excess amount of marinade. Very pretty presentation. Thank you for Sharing.

I was skeptical about this recipe but it was a big hit at my bunco party. I used cheddar, pepper jack and creme cheeses, marinated in bottled Zesty Italian dressing with green onion tops and roasted red peppers. I served it with Crunchmaster sesame crackers and everyone loved it. I will definitely make again for a crowd.

Loved this recipe.  A friend of mine has this recipe but uses balsamic vinegar.  I've made it both ways and I have to say if you like balsamic it gives this recipe one more star!

This was very good, but I will make a few changes next time. Specifically, I will use more cream cheese, and if I use cheddar again, I will slice it thinner and longer. The cheddar never gets a texture where it becomes easy to use on a cracker or crostini; so next time, I'll just cut it directly into a shape that will work well with my breads. If you let it marinate for days on end, the oil solidifies, but you can just scrape it off and discard or just leave your cheese on display at room temperature and the oil solids melt again. Not a pleasant mental image, but doesn't hurt the flavor either!

I made this for a party at my husband's co-worker's house and had to abandon it and buy something at the last minute. I froze the cream cheese to make it easier to cut, but in no time it was soft again and impossible to pickup. It began sort of melting into the dressing and looked terrible. It tasted good, but it was ugly to look at and not appetizing. We ate it at home, but there was no way that I could bring this to a party

Made this recipe for Ist time for family party. What a hit!!!
did make some changes, added lots of sun-dried tom. chopped(in oil)and more garlic. Spooned it onto large round platter, using toasted bruscheta slices around outer edge of platter. Tossed remaining marinade with drained can of large black olives and filled opening in center of platter with them.Finished center with a tomato rosette. Looked great!!!

I made this for an appetizer for the 4th of July. It was very, very good. I substituted low fat cream cheese and it kind of melted into a blob, but a very delicious one. The cheddar held it's shape well and was very good plain or on a cracker. If it's warm and you want a good presentation, serve on ice. But it is so good, no one will really care what it looks like. Thanks!

I've made this recipe several times and get comments about how elegant and gourmetish is looks.  Instead of crackers I go to the neighborhood bakery and have a demi sliced thin. The bread is great with the marinade.

Made this yesterday for a cocktail party where everyone brought a dish and it was gone by the end of the evening. I served on crackers, or you could stick in toothpicks and serve that way. One suggestion, make sure you have a large serving tray or it won't all fit if you are taking this with you.
I had a lot of marinade left over so I used it as a salad dressing today.

This was a great recipe.  Everyone loved it.  You do have to let it marinate however, if you want to get all that flavor.  I did try to make it with sweetner one time, instead of sugar.  Wasn't quite as good, but an option.

This is an absolutely amazing appetizer! I have made this for two parties. My daughter has made it for a party at her house and every time it is a huge hit. Be sure to freeze the cream cheese for about 45 minutes before you cut it. It makes it so much easier. Otherwise follow recipe as printed for the one of the most delicious cheese appetizers ever!

Excellent recipe!  It's very attractive when plated nicely.  I had a handful of swiss and mozzarella to use up so I cut those up too and they were delicious in the marinade.

Disappointed with this especially since there are so many wonderful reviews.  I thought maybe it was just my personal taste but I took it to dinner party and it did not go over very well.  I think everyone tried it but I recieved no compliments or requests for the recipe.  I only marinated for 5 hours (thank goodness as the wine vinegar is very strong) I removed from the marinate to plate and it was still very greasy.  I will not make again.

This is a great recipe. I dont have pimentos so I would used grilled bell peppers (green, red, and yellow), to add more color to it and the grilled peppers add a nice smokey flavor to the cheese. Cut back a bit on the oil, it may be a little too runny or greasy. Also instead of using crackers and having it as a type of dip, do it hors d'eourve style. Cut a baguette into 1" slices spread a little butter on them and toast them, than top with the cheese marinade, making it into a crustini. Place on a nice platter and all your friends will be amazed at the beautiful display.

I marinated the cream cheese only and it was a hit. I had some extra marinade and I put some on my husband's sandwich the next day. I also made the marinade two days before the party. That really helps the flavors develop more. Tasty!

This is one of my favorite things to take to a party. It always gets rave reviews-especially from the women! I have layered cheddar, mozzarella and cream cheese or any combination. The cream cheese soaks up the flavor better than the other cheeses. i think soft cheeses absorb the flavors better.

Wonderful recipe. Beautiful presentation. I took this to a couples Bunco and it disappeared! The men enjoyed it even more than the women. they couldnt stop eating it. I did add and 8 oz pkg of Moneray Jack cheeze, as I knew I would be serving many. Other than that i didnt change a thing!

Amazing!  Full of flavor.  A friend shared this recipe with me and I served this at a Pampered Chef party.  Every single person LOVED it.  My copy of the recipe walked out the door with the demonstrator.  I served the remainder of the marinade with french bread slices per my friend's suggestion. Thanks Elle!

This was H-U-G-E hit at our Thanksgiving table. Everyone commented on how absoloutely beautiful it looked and were impressed by the taste.  Needless, to say it was gobbled up within minutes.  The only complaint: You didn't make enough! I am going to triple the recipe for Christmas! Thanks for this outstanding, absolutely georgous appetizer! We're from Philly so we love cream cheese in anything, of course! Four Stars!

I took this to a party and it was a big hit.  I did make a few minor changes.  I substituted diced sundried tomatoes for the pimento and used 1-1/2 tsp minced fresh basil.  I also used cheddar and monterey jack cheese.  I want to try mozzarella and other cheeses next time.

This tastes best with Cilantro instead of parsley. Forget serving with crackers, tastes fabulous served with french bread to absorb all the marinade. My husband and I made this "dinner" with a glass of wine. :)

I made this dish for a church function and everyone loved it.  I've never had so many people ask me for a recipe before.  I couldn't find white wine vinegar so I substituted balsamic vinegar.  It still tasted great, but some of the colors of the dish were lost in the darker color of the vinegar.  I also substituted the sun-dried tomatoes for the pimentos, as another reader suggested.  I am looking forward to making this again with the white wine vinegar.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This recipe is amazing. I went to a wine tasting last night and it was wonderful both tangy and creamy. I'm so glad I found the recipie. I read the other reveiews and the suggestions are spot on - use a dark colored plate to highlight the dish and you may want to replate as there is a lot of marinade.

Delicious and unique appetizer!  I recently served it at a party and everyone wanted the recipe.  It's especially nice during the holidays. I serve with triscuits or wheat thins.

Wow, this was wonderful. Everyone who tried this ask for the recipe. I have served this at a Christmas party (looks very festive) and a progressive dinner. I placed the cream cheese in the freezer for a while, it really helps in making nice clean slices.

This recipe is awesome!  I've made it a few times for friends and family and it's always a hit!  It's best to make the recipe the night before but be sure to use it the next day, because it doesn't keep well past the next day (the cream cheese turns to liquid).

Fantastic! This was a big hit at my dinner party. I put the (low fat) cream cheese in the freezer for about two hours to make cutting it easier. Have your cheddar ready to go before preparing the cream cheese. That way you're ready to start assembling as soon as you've sliced the cream cheese (it will get soft quickly). I had some roasted red peppers on hand, so I used those in place of the pimento. I served with wheat crackers and pita chips. Yummy!

Big Hit!  had this at a friends party - soo- yummy!  The key is to freeze the cream cheese before slicing(If that doesn't work for you, I think it would be nice with mozzarella or provolone in it's place)

Amazing!  I ended up having to put the cream cheese in the freezer for a bit because it was too soft to cut.  Next time I'll try using fresh mozzerella balls.

I had this at a party and wanted to make it for my own New Year's Eve party. AWESOME! I did try the cream cheese, but I'll skip it next time. It was too mushy. However, the dish was much prettier with the white cream cheese. The marinate was wonderful and a huge it with my guests

I have been making this recipe for about 10 years. It's always a favorite and I even coveted it for a long time : ) giving it only as very special secret recipe gifts to friends. 
A wonderful appetizer! I usually add a bit more dried basil ,use sharp cheddar & always extra garlic, though you really don't have to change it a bit!

OUTSTANDING!  My sister-in-law made this as a Christmas appetizer and it was devoured in no time.  The flavor of the marinade is absolutely divine.  And the color from the pimento was so festive for the holidays.  This recipe is going in my Appetizer File immediately!  Oh, I just thought some people would like to know:  She started marinating hers around 7 a.m. Christmas morning, and it was delicious by 2 p.m.  (in case you forget the night before!)

If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.  This is a hit every time I take it to a party.  One of my favorites.  Visually impressive, too, and great because you can make it a day in advance.  Great for a wine party!

I've made this recipe twice and it has been the hit of the evening both times. Everyone asks for the recipe (including a neighbor who is a chef)and it is gone by the end of the night. I know the reviews on this recipe are mixed, but everyone in our neighborhood rates it at 5+.

Hint: I put the cream cheese in the freezer just long enough to make it stiffer. This made it hold together better while cutting.

Fantastic!  I take this everywhere and everyone (I do mean everyone) loves it!  It's great on Triscuits, bagel chips, or baby baquettes.  I make it in a shallow quiche dish and don't even worry about transferring it to another dish for serving.  I have been asked for the recipe so many times I have it memorized.  The key is to let it marinate at least 24 hours.

I could not find white wine vinegar so I used red. I used white cheddar cheese, but I think the orange wouuld give more contrast against the cream cheese. One of my friend suggested arranging the cheese in a circle and it would look like a Christmas wreath. There was a lot of marinate left over.

Wow!!  This was sooo good.  The favorite was the cream cheese but is was so hard to cut and didn't hold its shape while marinating so I just marinated the whole block and served it with the sauce poured over it.  Awesome!!

I hate to be in the minority here, but I didn't like this at all and I'm not a picky eater.  I took it to a potluck over the weekend.  I didn't hear one compliment on it and there were 50 people there.  I used cilantro instead of the parsley, but followed everything else as stated.  Sorry!

This is beyond belief.  I took it to a potluck and it disappeared.  I used celentro instead of parsley, and marinated tofu vegan friends.  The cream cheese is my personal favorite.

I made this and took it to work to see how it would go over. Most people (including myself) loved it and it was gone by the end of the day. My husband loved it, too. The cream cheese was the best! Would use sharp cheddar instead of medium next time. This is a great low carb snack on a Triscuit. YUM!

I can't believe how good this is!  I didn't think the cream cheese would be good at all and my husband wasn't going to even try this.  After being talked into trying it, he absolutely loved it.  He kept talking about how good this was several hours after eating it. Thanks.

This recipe is excellent made with Cilantro.  Tried this by chance.  Didn't have parsley, but had Cilantro.  I will use Cilantro in the future.

This was very good.  I didn't have white vinegar on hand so I used Rice Vinegar and it tasted better than I expected.  I kept nibbling on this while preparing for the party.

I make this often for parties.  It makes a beautiful dish.  The flavors are a little too strong though.  I use only 2 TBSP of green onions and 1 clove of garlic and bump up to 2 tsp of sugar.  I generally like rich, spicy food and even so prefer these changes.

I use balsamic instead of the white wine vinegar and about a tablespoon of the dry italian salad dressig mix (in addition to the seasonings already on the recipe). Everyone inhales this and it is a regularly requested item. Works great with triscuits that hold up so well with the cheese and marinade. If making for a party of more than a few people highly recommend doubling the recipe.

I made this for a Thanksgiving appetizer and my guests could NOT get enough of it.  I'm not a fan of pimento, but I quickly roasted some red bell peppers I had on hand and added those.  The only other change I made was to add some slices of hard salami I wanted to use up and I do believe it really enhanced the flavors.  Will  make this over and over.  Just loved it!!

I brought this to  a neigbourhood party. i had neighbours begging for the recipe. this is awesome. I used sundried tomotoes which worked well.
the cream cheese is the best cheese in the dish so leave it in. i put it in the freezer for 15 minutes and it was easy to slice.
unique and very yummy.

Used it at three gatherings recently -- absolutely everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. Used sun-dried tomatoes. Did not slice cream cheese second and third time -- just cut a bit and smeared it onto cheddar cheese. Served with Trader Joe's Multigrain & Flaxseed Water Crackers. Each serving had cracker with cheddar AND cream cheese covered in marinade. Did not transfer to new plate. Would love to know if I could freeze this marinade ahead of time.

I’ve been making this for years and it’s ALWAYS a hit no matter when, where or what the occasion; everyone always wants the recipe.  It definitely has that strong taste of vinegar so I recommend you use high quality white wine vinegar, but all the other spices mellow it out to help soften your palette.  It is also very easy to make and has a really pretty presentation.

I LOVE this recipe!  I've occasionally added sun-dried tomatoes.  I sometimes use Monterrey Jack along with the cheddar and cream cheese.  The milder cheeses absorb the flavors of the marinade better.  Yum.

I love that this recipe has to be made hours in advance so that there is no preparation work when ready to serve.  You must eat it within 36 hours, otherwise it gets a congealed texture.

I made this as an appetizer for Christmas after one of my coworkers was telling me how wonderfully hers went over at our recent Christmas party (it was so good it was gone before I had a chance to try it).    I used sharp cheddar, mozzarella, and cream cheese and followed everything to a "t" with the exception of using grilled red peppers and green zucchini marinated in oil (found a jar at the market) in place of the pimento and parsley.  I marinated overnight in the fridge for 12+ hours.  The smell of the white wine vinegar was completely overwhelming and the flavor was NOT appealing.  I was really disappointed.  I really don't think the vinegar should be in equal proportion to the oil.  Needless to say only half was eaten (though my boyfriend and mom braved their way through most of that), and my aunt, who hosted, sent us back home with the other half.    I wished the outcome was better, but I won't be trying this one again.

Not pretty, but tasty. I'll stick to an easier version of this with less ingredients. If it LOOKED better, it would be great, but by the time people dig in, it's just a big ugly mess...

I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out pretty well! I thought that the taste of the vinegar was fairly strong, though. It was a pretty dish though, and nicer than just plain cheese with crackers. I will definitely make this again. (I think in the future I will freeze the cream cheese for a few minutes before cutting it; the "squares" of cream cheese didn't stay very square as I was cutting them.)

I did a few other things to help this recipe along, such as additional seasonings, some parm, capers and black olives as a garnish. The cheddar, capers and olives went at our gathering, but the cream cheese just sat there. No one raved or even commented on this recipe. Oh well, can't win 'em all. Thanks anyway.

I really didn't like this recipe as written.  The marinade did not have much flavor and I had to add a lot of additional seasoning.  The presentation was very pretty.

I made this twice, for two different groups of people. I was thinking that the first group must've been wrong since everyone pretty much avoided it, but no.  It was oily and too messy to eat.  The flavours were ok but it wasn't something you wanted more than one or two bites of.  It didn't present well on the dish no matter how hard I tried to make it look appealing, it just wasn't.  I would not make this again.

This is always a hit! Put the cream cheese in the freezer to help with slicing. You can use roasted red peppers instead of pimento. Serve with crackers for the cheese and bread for the marinade.

I've been making this for holiday parties for years, I always get requests to make this! It's delicious served on Triscuits and toasted baguette. It's a little bit of work to put together, but worth the effort! I know some use chopped roasted red pepper or sundried tomatoes, but I prefer the pimento as the recipe calls for. Delicious!

Two stars for ease of prep.  Looked good, but  no one cared for it .  Out of 8 people only one person liked it and I think they were being polite.   I thought it was okay, but I  won't make it again.

I have made this before but lost the recipe.  It is the best marinated cheese I have found.  
Easy to put together. I didn't bother with the presentation just sliced the cheese put it in a container and poured the marinade over.  Gave some samples to me friends and they loved it also.
I did add extra garlic and used rice wine vinegar because that is what I had.  
Thank you for sharing.

This is a spectacular recipe!  I Highly recommend making it the night before to allow the wonderful flavors to more completely bind together.

Perhaps the most amazing thing about this recipe is the grilled cheese sandwiches that you can make with any left-overs.

I use 2 different colors of cheddar for contrast between slices. It's my number one loved appetizer!

I put on the side a cut up a French bread to dip in the marinade.

I've made this a few times and it's very good!  I agree the cream cheese is difficult to work with.  After making it as is, and making it with minor changes, here is my preferred way to make it now:
I use a quality sharp cheddar cheese, and I use fresh mozzarella cheese in the little balls, about the size of grape tomatoes. I make the marinade as stated, maybe a little extra garlic, and put it in a large ziploc bag.  Cut the cheddar, drain the mozz balls, and add them both to the marinade.  Marinade for a few hours.
At serving time, in a divided bowl, I put olives (blue cheese stuffed the best) on one side and marinated cheeses on the other.   Next to this a plate of crackers and some smoked sausage.  Easy easy easy, nice presentation, and delicious.  The cheese tastes better as it sits out at room temp.  Thanks for a fine recipe!

Very easy to make and is a hit with everyone that tries it.  I never have any left.  I normally put the cream cheese in freezer for about 10 minutes.  It is a lot easier to cut.

I made this twice, and both times it didn't generate any comments from those who tried it.  I thought it was reasonably good, but apparently it didn't impress others.  It seemed a little vinegary, but otherwise it had a good taste.  I substituted Monterey Jack for the cream cheese based on the comments from others about the difficulty of cutting the cream cheese.  I also just put the pieces randomly into my serving dish rather than trying to arrange them.  It makes a pretty presentation, and it's certainly easy enough to make.

This has been a favorite of mine for years.  It's lovely and so, so good.    The flavors are supposed to be strong, but I guess that doesn't work for everyone's palate.  However, I have never served it without it disappearing quickly (and people begging for the recipe).

I made this recipe for a fall dinner party I attended and it was a HUGE hit! Everyone wanted a copy of the recipe. It was easy to make (other than a little tricky to slice cream cheese!) and I like the prepare-ahead aspect. Thank you for posting :-)

This was good!  I was worried about the cream cheese breaking down like others said, but mine didn't (I used the full fat version, maybe that's why).  I used sun dried tomatoes instead of pimento.

Great for parties!  Guests rave about the presentation and taste.  It's just as good if you substitute Italian dressing for the dressing mixture.  It's also delicious (although not as pretty) if you use hot pepper cheese instead of cheddar.

This is one of the best appetizer recipes I have ever come across!  I make this every year for Christmas and everybody loves it!  I can't get enough of it and always make enough for the next day because it is even better after it's been sitting for a day or two in the fridge.  YUM!!!

I make this recipe for our fat days at work. It's always one of the first plates to disappear.
  This year I added a black olive Tapinade to the mix.  Poured over the top of the cheese platter with a spoon. I purchase demi's from the local bakery sliced thin.

Boy, everyone loved this recipe!  I found it easier to just spread the cream cheese in between the slices of cheddar rather than try to cut the cream cheese.  Very yummy with crackers!  The whole thing was devoured.

I am really on the fence on this one, it does make a nice presentation, however, the vinegar is way too overpowering. I was really excited to make this because I've wanted to make it for a long time, but was really disappointed with the taste. The first bite I thought was really bad, then I waited a few days & tried it again & it was ok, so I can't make up my mind...I wouldn't make it for anybody tho....sorry, I was realy disappointed!

At my hospital's annual fundraiser, this appetizer was my greatest downfall.  I had been begging for the recipe for over a month when I found it on this site.  Looks great, tastes great, and easy to make--What combo!  Putting the cream cheese in the freezer for an hour or so helped the cutting process alot! thanks!

This was a great recipe. I served it with garlic triscuits. We love garlic. It was a hit and everyone asked for the recipe. Pepper cheese works as it is soft and adds an extra kick. Thanks for the great recipe.

It is best if it is not marinated more than twelve hours and the liquid is drained before serving. Also, I no longer use cheddar cheese (it does not absord the seasoning as well) or serve it with crackers (only because no body eats the crackers or bread I serve with it.) Freezing the cream cheese before cutting is a good idea in theory but seems to cause the cream to cream to run more than if just kept int he freezer. If the presentation doesn't turn out well, maybe it is you. I am glad I gave it try and so does anyone else who tries it!!

I made this for a family party and everyone liked it but I would drain off the marinade before I served it as it made it very oily.

WARNING! You will not be able to stop eating this! I used 3 different types of cubed cheese ( I was in a hurry) and displayed them like a puzzle. Fantastic!

What a great recipe for any occasion!  Because of the ingredients, it makes a great Christmas party presentation, but I can't imagine leaving it off the menu for any type of get together, it is easy and delicious!

This made a very pretty, colorful dish; however, I didn't care for the oiliness(?).  Hubby - who normally loves anything even remotely Italian - only tried one piece.  I took this to my in-laws on Christmas Eve and I was disappointed.

My sister-in-law made this for Thanksgiving and I had never tried anything like it.  I had to stay away from it or I would have eaten it all!!  Made it myself for Christmas---left out pimetos tho--not a fan of them.

I had a hard time visualizing the recipe, the comment about changing dishs.
I put it in the dish I wanted to serve it first, good thing, the cream cheese is too soft to handle very much.
Served it as a party appetizer, many teens, the adults tried it, about half LOVED it and wanted the recipe, the others could take it or leave it. My husband thinks the leftovers would be good in a salad w/the sauce as dressing.
I'll try again at Easter, using something else besides cream chees.

I have made it for years and people love it!  I was in a hurry today and did not have long for it to marinate so I sliced the cheddar cheese and stuck it in the marinade and let it get a little on each piece while I cut up the cream cheese.  (It really helps to put the cream cheese in the freezer for 15 minutes and use a small knife to slice it) It is beautiful and tasty!

this was soooo good - i have made it several times and each time it was gone in about 5 minutes. I agree with some of the other reviewers that the crean cheese is difficult to slice, but once it's on crackers or tiny toast no one cares - they just want to eat it !!! a definite keeper.

Well, I have to say I was very disappointed with this, especially since it got such a high rating.  I made the marinade exactly as stated.  I used only cheddar cheese, and found that after letting it sit for almost 2 days, the cheese was nothing but cheese with sauce on it.  The cheddar hadn't absorbed any of the marinade.  And the marinade itself was was too sour.  I am going to add some more sugar to what I have left, just so we will eat it.  I will not be making this again.

This was very beautiful, but looks aren't everything. I was a little disappointed that all those ingredients didn't deliver more interesting flavor. Probably won't make this again, too time consuming for just fair results.

I'm afraid I'll have to agree with those who did not care for this recipe.  The presentation was pretty...nice and colorful, but no one at our family gathering gave it a "thumbs up".  I'll keep looking for that "special" recipe to add to my collection.

This was very good served on Triscuits!  I'm thinking that next time I make it, I'll try mozzarella cheese and balsamic vinegar. It's a keeper for sure.

A new favorite! I even cheated and used dried parsley and minced roasted garlic from a jar. I did add a dash of red pepper. Next time I will try bruschetta or a bread. Yummy!!
