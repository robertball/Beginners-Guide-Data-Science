I love sweet potatoes and had to try this recipe. I'm glad to report that it did not disappoint! I made mine in my crockpot on low for 5-6 hours. I sauteed the onions and aromatics as directed in step 4 and added to the crockpot along with the ingredients in step 5, and the black beans in step 6. I roasted the sweet potatoes while the chili was cooking and added them to the crockpot at the end to heat through. 

I didn't reduce the water in the recipe, and the amount of liquid at the end of the cook time was just right. To add more body to the chili, I smashed some of the beans up right in the crockpot to fill it out some. Sometimes when making chili if I remember, I reserve a 1/2 cup or so of the rinsed beans to smash and add when the chili is about done. I usually forget though and just smash in the pot. 

I served this with a pan of cornbread and topped the chili with fresh cilantro and a little shredded cheddar.

I have used this recipe twice, and it comes out perfect every time. It is my all time favorite chili recipe now. It is spicy, but not too hot. It is also very rich with just a hint of sweetness.

The second time I cooked it, the only thing I changed was that instead of putting a teaspoon of sugar in the chili, I put about a tablespoon of sugar on the sweet potatoes before I roasted them. This helped them brown and caramelize a little more. It came out great!

Yummy. Followed all directions with the exception of the jalapenos because I'm a wimp. It was really filling and tasted great. Love the chipotle flavor.

I made this for a Vegetarian/Vegan Potluck, and It was a great hit. Now I made this cause I wanted to make something different for the potluck. I generally don't like sweet potatoes, but I loved this and so did everyone else. It has a nice kick to it from the spices, and the sweet potatoes give the chili a really nice body. I will definately be making this again.

This turned out to be amazingly good. I used Trader Joe's low sodium Garden Patch vegetable juice in place of some of the water. I did not add any salt nor did I add any sugar and skipped the cornmeal. I used a dash of cayenne pepper instead of any ancho chili powder because I did not have any ancho chili powder. All of my dinner guests also loved this dish. Thank you Chef John for the recipe and the very helpful video.

I followed the recipe to a 't' and also made some rice to go along with it.  While the dish tasted fine, and I had enough for leftovers I won't make again.  The level of effort (chopping) and all of the ingredients I had to source left me wanting more.

If you have all the ingredients on hand - try it, but I wouldn't make a special trip to the store just to pick up the ingredients for this dish.

Sorry :(

I made this the other day and it was FANTASTIC!!  I had to make it friendly for a 3 and 5 yr old so I omitted all of the pepper, except for the red one, added a cup of frozen corn and some Mrs. Dash and it was still great! Everyone liked it and said they'd eat it again. I made scratch cornbread with the cornmeal I used in it and that was a hit too!

I followed the recipe exactly, paying no attention to those who said it was too hot because I love hot and spicy food!  I loved the layers of tastes and textures, but it IS too hot...a bit overpoweringly.  I would make this again, but I would stipulate using a *small* jalapeno pepper, and perhaps taking out the seeds.  Thanks for a vegetarian chili that really packs a punch!

What a difference roasting the sweet potatoes makes in the flavor of the chili. I have made sweet potato chili before but the flavor of the sweet potatoes can get lost in the simmering. I also roasted the red peppers along with the sweet potato, but still added them in with the tomatoes as suggested. We enjoyed this chili, but next time I think I'll reduce the chili powder and cumin a bit.

Loved, loved, loved this flavorful chili.  Didn't add chipotle, discarded the jalepeno seeds and used regular chili powder - other than that, made as directed.  Only gave 4 stars because too spicy if you don't tone it down.

So easy, and quick. I left out the sugar and cornmeal, and substituted tomato paste (saut√©ed with onions and peppers) and reconstituted sun-dried tomatoes for canned, since I didn't have them. Roasting the sweet potatoes in a cast iron skillet added even more flavor. The final result was saucy, spicy, smoky and delicious. I didn't miss the meat at all, and can't wait to make this many more times.

Simply the best vegan/ vegetarian chili I've ever tasted! I skipped the sugar (not necessary) and used one square of Lindt 90% cocoa bar instead of cocoa powder, because I had it on hand.  I also omitted the corn meal, because I didn't have any. For vegans, skip the sour cream; this chili is fabulous without it.

Surprisingly delicious (especially for a big-time meat-eater).  I cut back on the heat, and used 1 tbsp of mild chili powder.   I also some corn in the mix near the end of cooking.
This can totally be made a day ahead and actually tastes better after the flavours have all melded.

The first time I made it I thought it was the jalopena that made it too hot, so am making a big pot for a dinner party without jalopena and it's so spicy it's not even edible. And I followed to a t as well. This is extremely disappointing and I have to order a pizza in for my party. How can I be the only person to think the spiciness is unedible?  My 12 dinner guests will agree I'm sure and head right to the pizza box

I did make this recipe only used butternut squash instead of sweet potatoes because that was what I had. Fixed the squash like the potatoes only used smoked paprika. Didn't have jalapenos so used 1/2 can of chilpotle peppers in adobo sauce 7.5 oz chopped up. We loved it and our daughter loved it and I will definitely make it again.

I only scrubbed the sweet potatoes then cubed them with the skins on..... And I tossed them with olive oil, cinnamon, garlic powder & salt before roasting. Oh my! The flavors really penetrated the whole dish (and the house!)This is one of the best chili renditions. For you meat lovers add sauteed mild Italian sausage....YUM! Jogee

WOW!  This came out really good!  The grocery store was out of jalapenos, so I used a hot green pepper instead.  I also put in only a teensy bit of cayenne pepper, so overall this came out very mild.  I like a little spice, so will use a jalapeno and a little more cayenne next time.  I have to say, this is restaurant quality soup - I would buy this out to eat, and yet it was relatively easy to make right at home.  So happy with this and am sure will make this often!

I tried this recipe!!! Awesome, awesome, awesome. Starting the beginning of this year, I became a Nutritarian and I was thinking about vegan/vegetarian recipes I could add to my diet, and I just happened to have this one in my email, I clicked on it and decided to try it, I am so glad I did it was totally awesome! I love it. I kept thinking it had meat in it. It was so good and flavorful with just the right amount of kick. It was even better the second day. I had some left over and I froze it, about a week later I came home and wanted something I could eat quickly and I warmed it up, my biggest regret is that there wasn't a bit more of it in the container to fully enjoy. This one is definitely a keeper.

I have made this twice. Once for an office potluck and once for a dear friend who has turned vegan!!! It was a hit both times. Roasting the sweet potatoes not only helps keep their shape in the chili but also brings out their flavor. No, I did not follow the recipe exactly. Used a single ghost pepper the first time - SPICY!!! Added lime juice just before serving. Skipped the sour cream. 
For my friend, just used a smaller amount of chili powder. Used one red and one yellow bell pepper and skipped the sugar and cocoa powder. Terrific Recipe!!!

This is an awesome recipe! Since I didn't have chipotle or ancho chili powders, I just used my regular Kroger chili powder and a dash of red pepper. I also added a can of drained corn. Simply scrumptious!

I used the recommended amount of ancho chile powder and jalapeno (seeded).  I love hot/spicy food but this was RIDICULOUSLY HOT!  I can't even judge the taste because of the heat.  I might try this again without so much spice.  Good lord this is hot!

I have lost weight lately and am always looking for a good healthy recipe that includes vegetables and uses all whole foods. However this had way too many spices and hot peppers for me. I only used the cayenne but I added diced cooked Italian sausage to still give it a spicier kick. The whole family loved it!

I loved the flavor in this!  Very tasty, but sooo spicy.  I left out the jalapenos and still had to guzzle down milk with it..  and I generally like spicy foods.

I love sweet potatoes every which way. Hubby dislikes sweet potatoes most ways but loves them here! The recipe is a definite keeper based on that alone! I added/omitted/substituted some items due to what I had in stock. I omitted the red bell pepper, substituted cayenne for the ancho chile on the sweet potatoes during roasting, did not peel the sweet potatoes for added nutrition, de-seeded the sliced jalapenos (Hubby doesn't handle spicy foods well) and added meat and juices of a 7-bone roast that I cooked in a slow cooker.

The recipe made closer to 6 servings than the stated 4. We will be eating this for lunch throughout the week with some cornbread, of course!

Excellent recipe! I'm laughing at those who think 1 jalape√±o and a pinch of cayenne is too spicey in like a gallon of two of chili.

This chili is awesome!  My daughter prefers vegetarian meals, and she could eat this every day.  My six year old son loves it, too, even though he claims to "hate" sweet potatoes.

Okay, so I've had this recipe several times. A couple things to note--roasting the sweet potatoes is genius and really helps keep the texture. The recipe calls for ancho chile powder. You HAVE to use ancho chile (or some other really mild pepper). Generic chili powder is too hot. I made this mistake the first time around when serving this at a dinner party and no one finished their bowls.

This last time I "Africanized" and it was out of this world. It was amazing. Seriously, I have made a lot of chilis in my day, but the way I modified it would have won an award. Chili is one of those things in which you can make a good recipe, but not great. This was great. I added ginger to the garlic mixture. I reduced the ancho chili to half, added some smoked paprika and a generous pinch of cardamom. I used hickory smoked salt on the sweet potatoes and at the end when seasoning. I reduced the oregano to a pinch (probably could have omitted it from the African version). I used chicken stock instead of water and added a generous dollop of peanut butter. I also used fresh heirloom tomatoes. I have nothing against canned, but I had them on hand and needed to use them. The flavor that the tomatoes added was amazing. It made a huge difference. I used black pepper instead of cayenne, and of course seasoned at the end to taste.

I made this using regular pepper instead of chipotle pepper, and a few dashes of cayenne instead of the ancho chili powder. I also left the jalape√±o seeds outs, as I was trying to minimize spice. It was tasty!

I entered this chili in the vegetarian category at my company's annual chili cook-off and it won!  It even came in second place overall, only losing to a more conventional meat chili.  The only thing I added was a cup or so of frozen corn for a little more texture and color.  I love this chili!

Oh my gosh! This chili is the bomb! I made it for dinner tonight and my family was going nuts. They loved it! I adjusted only a couple of things; I added only one tablespoon of ancho chili powder instead of two and I minced my jalape√±o rather than slicing it. Also, I did not add cayenne pepper. Even with these changes (or omissions) the chili still had a "kick" to it....it was the perfect spicy-ness. Even my 13- and 9-year-old boys loved it! Definitely a keeper.

It was so delicious and pretty easy to make. I've made it twice. First time I followed the recipe exactly, and it was good. But what made it better the second time around is cutting the sweet potatoes into bite-sized cubes and adding just a little bit of bbq sauce for added sweetness and smokiness. Can't recommend it enough. Even my meat-loving husband enjoys this chili!

As a note of encouragement to those who don't have cumin or ancho chili powder on hand - you don't need it.  I used red pepper flakes, chili powder, and a New Orleans Cajun seasoning in leu of those two items, and then used Cayenne as directed. I also did not have a jalapeno, cornmeal, or a red bell pepper.  I exchanged half of the diced tomato amount with a can of rotel, exchanged the cornmeal for flour, and the red bell pepper for a green bell pepper.  So the moral of the story is, this recipe is awesome even if you have to improvise half of the ingredients.

I got compliments from everyone on this chili!  I did add some shredded seasoned chicken that I had cooked in the crock pot.  Also removed the seeds from the jalapeno pepper to make less hot but used spicy black beans from Whole Foods.  Absolutely delicious and will make again!

Very, very good and different too. I followed the recipe but added two extra ingredients. A can of corn and some chicken. I roasted the sweet potatoes (and precooked the chicken) like in the recipe but did everything else in the crockpot. My husband loved it. I would definitely make this again.

This recipe is a keeper.  I always caution restraint with ground cumin though.  If you ever "OD" on cumin the aroma of "old gym locker" will never leave you.  I used 1 tsp instead of 1 T and it was quite sufficient I thought.  Also consider yourself fortunate if you get your sweet potatoes (yams) from California or Utah because they will be naturally sweet.  Here on the E. coast our sweet potatoes are not really sweet.  We usually help them out with copious brown sugar and cinnamon. So the recipe as I made it didn't have quite the impact it should have.  Next time (and there will definitely be a next time)I think I will try some kind of glaze on the Sweet potatoes as they bake and see if it helps.

Really, really good. I love sweet potatoes and black beans, so I knew I was going to like this recipe from the start. But the flavor that it has adds a whole new element to this combination. And despite some of the reviews that it would be too spicy, I ended up adding more of everything to make up for the zucchini, mushrooms, and corn that I added. It was delicious and I will definitely make it again!

The chili base is so amazing.  Do not omit the cocoa as it is magic.  Great dish all around.  The sweet potatoes not only make an interesting addition, but they turn this into a complete protein meal.  I will admit that they contrasted too much with the base, but it really works well.  My mods... used Italian seasoning due to no oregano, added some paprika, used brown sugar instead of white.  if it seems like too much heat reduce or omit the ancho chili, and you can remove jalapeno seeds.  I would not limit Chipotle because it adds its own flavor and does not contribute much to the heat.

Wow, this is a good 'un!  I was looking for recipes that were lower GI & this fit the bill - you can even trade out that tiny teaspoon of sugar for agave.  Not only is it healthy, but uber tasty, too.  Nice & spicy!

This was fantastic! The only changes I made were I used vegetable spray instead of olive oil in both instances and substituted Splenda for sugar. I ended up using about 2 1/2 cups water for my chili. I also roasted, then cooled my sweet potatoes while the rest was simmering on the stove. At the 30 minute mark all was ready to combine, heat through and eat!

Made this (tripled)for a school potluck, without the cayenne, and with only 2 jalape√±os, just in case it might be too hot for some.  Added the tomatoes, water, beans, and roasted sweet potatoes all at once and finished it in the slow cooker for an hour. Came out great, and all got eaten!

Yet another great recipe from Chef John!  I am a confirmed carnivore, but this vegetarian, vegan even, I think, recipe was fantastic. I didn't have a jalapeno, so added a bit more chipotle pepper.  I had too much sweet potato, but cooked it all up as the recipe suggested and ate the extras straight up -- a great spicy sweet potato fry.
Thanks Chef John

I left out the sugar since it didn't need it as well as the corn meal and instead of sour cream I used greek yogurt with some lemon and chopped cilantro.    The "four" servings using the amounts shown came out to seven servings in total.

This is an amazingly flavorful chili.  I've made it 3 times since october and it's the best.  I have reduced the jalapeno to 1/2 of the pepper since it is a bit too spicy for some.  The sweet potatoes add a nice sweetness to the spiciness.  And I've used dark chocolate baking square instead of powdered chocolate/

I am not a huge fan of chili!!  I made this recipe for a chili cook off and won!  The flavors are incredible.  Roasting the potatoes really give the chili a great flavor.  Every time I serve this, it is a huge hit.

My wife and I have never had a meatless chilli and I was really worried about how it would turn out compared to the traditional way that everyone is used to. Well, let me tell you, worry no more. This was absolutely amazing in flavor, you didn't even miss the lack of meat. The potatoes took over the show as far as that was concerned and the heat from the peppers combined with the sour cream and cilantro topped it off and made all the I,ingredients come together. This was truly a spectacular show of a well blended recipe that was might tasty, long live Chef John!

I make this just the way the recipes calls for. I also often make just the roasted sweet potatoes to use as a side dish.

As usual, chef John's recipe is right on! I did make one change...  Instead of water, I used tomato juice. Just my personal preference. Thanx Chef John

So Good.  I used regular chili powder and it is amazing.  Everyone wants the recipe that tastes it.  The only thing is I found that roasting the sweet potatoes takes MUCH longer.  Put aside an extra hour just to be sure.  Simply Delicious.

The long list of yummy sounding ingredients and the additional techniques really had me excited about the layers of flavor I was sure this chili would provide.  While pretty good it certainly did not deliver the depth or layers of flavor to justify all the extra ingredients or extra techniques.

This was outstanding!  I halved the recipe in general but was heavy on the spices.  I also added a touch of cinnamon.  The sweet potatoes didn't come through as I expected but I'm sure it was bec I gave more bite on spices.  My husband says it's a keeper!

I LOVE this chili! I've made it at least once a month for the past couple years and everyone who tries it loves it, too, even people who religiously eat meat chili. My boyfriend was hesitant about it and didn't think it'd be filling. I usually increase all the seasonings a little bit and add some frozen corn at the same time as the beans and potatoes and serve it with a piece of cornbread in the bottom of the bowl, the sweetness of the cornbread compliments it soooo well. This is definitely a keeper, and it's pretty cheap to make as well!

I've made this several times now, and it's become my go to vegetarian chili. My family prefers a smooth sauce, but I didn't want to lose the red peppers. My solution has been to roast a whole pepper while I'm roasting the sweet potatoes. I make the tomato base without bell pepper, puree it, and then add in the beans, roasted peppers, and sweet potatoes. Delicious!

amazing!  made this for a vegetarian friend and my carnivorous husband raved about it!  Might dial down the spice next time for our pallets but otherwise a great hearty and low-fat dinner option for those cold winter nights.

This was so good. I don't normally like sweet potatoes and was looking for a way to use some up; my boyfriend couldn't believe I served him a meal without meat but even he admitted it was "decent." I didn't have ancho chile powder so left it out, I added more cayenne because it did need a bit more spice.

This was very good tasting & healthy too, also economical. Even my vegetarian sister & brother in law could eat this. I made this exactly as written except I deliberately I cut down on the amount of  heat by using the 1/2 t. ground dried chipotle pepper & only 1/2 of a fresh jalapeno pepper instead of a whole jalapeno. The heat from those two was plenty for us. I omitted the Ancho chili & cayenne. This had a really nice flavor especially when topped with the fresh cilantro & a dollop of sour cream.This also looks nice in the bowls with the black,red, orange, green and white colors. I'll be making this again from time to time.  Thanks for a good recipe Chef John.

I made this following the recipe to the letter and it came out absolutely perfectly. The sweet potatoes add such a richness, and it has perfect amount of kick from the jalapenos without the spiciness overwhelming the other flavors. It was also quite filling. Looking forward to making this one of our staple winter dishes!

This was great!!  The only thing I changed was to omit the sugar, and I seeded & chopped the jalapeno... it wasn't over spicy at all, and everyone (including my carnivore husband) loved it.  Thanks for another great recipe!

I just made this over the weekend and had it for the first time last night for dinner.  This is the BEST chili (without meat)!!!  Of course, I had to make a couple of adjustments because I didn't have some ingredients - I didn't have any ground chipotle pepper, so I used one Knorr chipotle mini cube to season the sweet potato before roasting and I didn't have any ancho chili powder, so I used cayenne pepper, but cut the amount to only 2 teaspoons instead of tablespoons.  It was AMAZING!!!  It had just the right amount of heat for me.  I like my chili thick, so I didn't bother adding more water at the end.  Oh, since I am a fan of garlic, I used about 2 tablespoons of chopped garlic.  I also used 2 jalapeno peppers for added heat.  Absolutely, without a doubt, this is my favorite recipe to date!!!

I made this recipe with some minor changes (left out the jalapeno and used red pepper flakes instead of cayenne), and it was much better than I expected. I have never made a meatless chili before, but I found this vegetarian chili very satisfying. The cocoa powder makes the broth rich in flavor and dark in color. Also, roasting the sweet potatoes ahead of time is definitely worth the extra step. I can see this recipe making its way into my regular rotation!

We made this today and it turned out so good. Very good in fact.  The favors of all the spices really added such a great taste.  I was worried about the jalapenos, but they really added a great favor and was not very hot at all.  I will make this again.  Will not change a thing on it.

I loved this. I roasted the pepper with the potatoes and then decided later that I wanted more potato so I diced up two more and added them with the tomatoes and both were good but I think searing the spices to the potatoes during the roasting really added to the flavor. Roasting the potatoes really improved the texture.  I will roast sweet potatoes in these spices again to serve alone, they were so good (maybe that is why I needed more for the chili).  I made this with the Awesome and easy creamy corn casserole and they were great.  thanks for a great recipe.  Ymmmmmmm.

Wow! This recipe is perfect! I made it in a slow cooker after saut√©ing the first ingredients, switched out a can of corn for one of the black beans and added the roasted sweet potatoes a half an hour before finishing on low. Sprinkled a little cheddar and dab of sour cream and it was amazing!  The chipotle spice is a must and really changes the flavor profile of regular chili. My husband and friends loved it!

Delicious! Zesty! Love it!
I couldn't find corn meal so I used a 1/4 cup of instant oats for the texture of "meat" even though this is a vegetarian recipe. Also, used my favorite tomato pasta sauce, one cup, and an extra half cup of water since I had no diced tomatoes. Will make again!

I loved this dish! I made it for a dinner party and it was a hit! Sad to say I had no leftovers; I'll have to make it again soon. Sauteed ingredients in step 4 then added to all from step 5, cooking in the crockpot on high for four hours. Right before serving I added roasted sweet potatoes. I also did what reviewer Spyce recommended and reserved 1/2 cup of rinsed black beans which I mashed and added at the end with the potatoes. Great taste and full texture!

This has been a wonderful, flexible, much-shared recipe!  For the corn-free crowd, I left out the corn meal.  It's already good for the dairy-free and veggie.  I've swapped in butternut squash for some sweet potatoes when i ran short and it was still wonderful!

This chili was GREAT!!!! I had to make it twice in just a period of 7 days. Made it for my husband and I and we just loved it. My daughter was coming home for Christmas and since she is vegan I have to always think of something extra good for her to eat. I made this chili and she absolutely loved it and took the recipe with her. Then my daughter in law came for a visit, tried some and also wanted the recipe, thank you so much for this delicious chili recipe.

This was great, my husband say this is the only chili recipe from now on. I did not have jalapeno pepper and used the chili powder I had handy and still had lots of zip to it.  Seems everything I have tried from Chef John is excellent.

This is really good chili. I added one link of chorizo and doubled the cocoa powder. It had plenty of flavor on its own and didn't need salt. Oh and the sweet potatoes were great on there own, they almost didn't make it into the chili.

Great googly moogly this is delicious! The only changes I made were done so because I didn't have something on hand. I used a yellow bell pepper and 1 can black beans plus 1 can chickpeas. The rest was all the same. I was thinking about forgoing the "special" spices (chipotle and ancho) but boy am I glad I didn't! Wonderful smoky flavor they added. I don't even like cilantro much but it adds something in the end. And it wasn't too spicy for me at all. If anything next time I'll add another jalape√±o.

I loved this recipe!  I made It today for a girls lunch and it was a hit. One of the girls doesn't care for sweet potatoes but loved them in this dish!  I omitted the jalape√±os but followed everything else as written. The flavor was complex and satisfying.  Interesting choice of ingredients, but they all somehow worked so well together.  Thank you for this delicious spin on chili and as other reviewers stated, you don't even miss the meat! I served it with sweet cornbread muffins. Perfect!

I skipped the cornmeal, and made with red kidney beans and black beans.  Also added red bell pepper at the end.  The result was a very colorful dish (red, black and orange) with sprinkle of greet chopped cilantro.  It is a perfect dish for a cold day, and looked beautiful when served.

This recipe was great!  The sweet potatoes and chipotle seasoning really added some fantastic flavors.  I added a green bell pepper in addition to the red one, and used honey instead of sugar -- other than that I followed the recipe as directed.

This is a good meatless recipe.   I substituted a jalapeno pepper and Mexican chili powder and also use a can of mild Rotel tomatoes.  It definitely has a bite, but is really good.  My girlfriend doesn't eat meat, so I gave her some and she loved it too.  You do need to add extra water also.  Thanks for sharing.

Oh Vishnu! Oh Kali! Oh Klahoma! This recipe is really really good. I followed 87% of the recipe because I love to improvise. No need for the corn meal if you slow cooker it. I added 3 dashes of cinnamon and subtracted 1/3 of the fresh jalape√±o. I would cut that down to 1/2 because it was borderline "Geez, this is frigging hot!"
I also substituted canned chipotle for the fresh stuff, but it worked just as well.

This is a keeper.

Very good. Robust flavor. I modified the peppery spices a bit and used chili style diced tomatoes. i have never used cornmeal as a thickener before, but I like it and I would certainly try this recipe again.

I am very calorie conscious so I took left out the sour cream and substituted Splenda for the sugar. Also left out the cornmeal and used fresh tomatos instead of canned. Thanks to the reviewers that reduced and or omitted the peppers. I decided to follow their advice and left out the spicy peppers. Excellent still with all the changes.

I loved it.  I took the seeds out of the jalapeno pepper to ease it up a little bit other than that it was a delicious find, and not hard to make.  I will be using this again.  Thanks!

I made this tonight and it was so scrumptious i cant wait for leftovers tomorrow. Now I did make some alterations because it would be entirely too spicy, add more nutrients and for time saving. I used frozen veggies and canned yams(reserve the juice) instead of fresh. I eliminated most of the peppers and just went with cayenne and chili pepper and a few "nacho" jalepeno I bought the cilantro but forgot to put it in used it for garnish with the sour cream, green onion and chives. I dont like using water for anything so I used veg broth and the reserved canned yam juice to nicely thin out the chili. veg broth kept it flavorful while the yam liquid kept it chili dense i did add a bag of vegetable stew veggies(okra, lima beans, corn, celery) I also used diced flavored tomatoes instead of whole peeled crushed. I served this with a chopped salad and salmon cornbread cakes

An awesome recipe!   I made a slight change - I roasted my sweet potatoes in the smoker and added smoked paprika with the other spices.   A little sweet, smokey and spicy - the perfect combination!  For personal preference I didn‚Äôt  use any cayenne - it was perfectly seasoned as it was.

Easy to make and a way to use up frozen tomatoes and frozen peppers.  My husband is vegetarian and loves sweet potatoes as well as chipotle, so this is a great dish for his taste.  I will certainly make again.

This is a recipe I've used more than anything else, other than a couple bread recipes. It suits a wide range of diets and palates.  I replace the jalapenos with a small can of fire roasted green chilies. Because I make this at least 3-4 times a year, buying all the spices was no waste. Dont forget trying a store where you can buy spices in bulk if you arent sure you'll make it again.
Perfect fall and winter meal with cornbread. 
Definitely make this!!

This was an amazingly easy recipe (I am a novice cook) for a healthy, freezable meal.  I was able to eat a bowl and freeze 5 additional servings, and I was able to cut out the sugar and greatly reduce the olive oil, so don't let the 600 calorie count per serving scare you away.  I cut the chipotle pepper in half, subbing in some smoked paprika in its place and left out the jalapeno, instead adding additional heat at the end with a few dashes of cayenne. I also left out the sugar (The tomatoes and sweet potatoes were sweet enough for me) and only sprayed the sweet potatoes with olive oil rather than using a whole tablespoon as suggested in the recipe.   The sweet potatoes were so delicious coming out of the oven that I have made a note to use the roasted sweet potato part of this recipe as a side for Mexican dishes such as chicken fajitas (instead of tortillas).  Next time that I make this chili, I will blend 1/2  of one of the cans of black beans (and maybe a cup or so of the chili mixture) in order to bring the ingredients together to make it a more cohesive tasting dish.  That being said, I was very happy with how this chili came out, and I will be freezing leftovers for lunches.  It took me less than 15 minutes to prep ingredients and required minimal effort through out the cooking process.  A great recipe to make on a weekend morning when you are doing other things around the house.

Couldn't find chipotle powder, so used more than a pinch of Cayenne (red pepper) instead, along with a fresh jalape√±o. Did find the ancho chile powder, however, and the other ingredients. It was a 5-star success. 
Roasting the sweet potatoes is what we normally do, so that part was easy. I will make this again and look up other recipes from Chef John on the allrecipes site.

I did this almost exactly as written. Delicious black bean and sweet potato Chili. And perfect with sour cream and fresh cilantro to garnish it.

makes way more than 4 servings I didn't have any cocoa or cornmeal but still turned out really well. Quite spicy so you may want to dial back the chili poweder

This was so good!  Will definitely make it again. Left out oregano and sugar. The sweet potatoes gave it enough oof a sweet taste.  Cut sweet potatoes into small bites.

I have made this recipe many times.  The cocoa and ancho chile powder give it incredible depth of flavor. Smoked paprika is a nice add.  I usually use 2 lbs. dried beans when I make it - yes that much!  It is spectacular when cold out or you are feeling autumnal.  If you cook the chili too long the sweet potatoes dissolve - this is not going to ruin it, but it is very undesirable.

I subbed extra anchos + liquid smoke for chipotle peppers, which I didn't have. You can't go wrong adding liquid smoke. I also subbed stevia for the sugar, which I could have done w/ less of. I completely forgot to add the cayenne, and it was fine for me. Next time I would add the bell peppers toward the end for a crunchier texture. They don't need to be stewed for the whole duration.

My go to veggie chili recipe. Better than with meat. I've fooled a lot of meat eaters with this recipe. They don't realize it doesn't have meat,. The flavor is perfect and complex. I think The cocoa gives it the complexity. Thank you Chef John!

I made this on Sunday and I listened to the reviewers who said it was super spicy so I dialed down the chipotle chili pepper, substituted regular chili powder for ancho chile and dialed back the cayenne. I found the dish not spicy at all!!! I'm not sure I would go all the way to the full amounts stated but I'm definitely going to be putting in much more chile in it next time. 

Despite the lack of heat, it was great on flavor. However, it came out super dry. I omitted the cornmeal as I didn't have any and even ended up adding an extra 3/4 cup of water and it was still very thick. I am not sure what to do to add liquid without compromising on flavor as it was perfect but I had to drink a lot while eating it. Another hit from Chef John!

This is one of the very best chili recipes I've ever tasted. With the added fact that it's a vegetarian dish, this is a wonderful addition to our family's list  of meals.  Follow the recipe as written and it will NOT be too spicy. Roast the sweet potatoes while you're putting the rest of the ingredients together.  I added Mexican chorizo to the recipe the last time I made it and it was luscious.  I highly recommend this one.

Too spicy. Followed recipe exactly but used black pepper instead of chipotle pepper to season sweet potatoes as I didn‚Äôt have that. Had to use this as a side curry dish with rice as was too spicy for me to be eaten alone as chilli. But looks really great and has potential. Next time would make the below changes-a) put only 2 teaspoon or 1 tablespoon instead of recommended 2 tablespoon of ancho chile powder. b)Put in only ¬º of jalapeno pepper, deseeded & white membranes removed instead of whole jalapeno. Thanks for the recipe, Chef John.

I agree that roasting the sweet potatoes before adding them to the stew brings out the sweetness. I have mixed red, and yellow peppers along with the green. I'm not vegetarian but I am cutting back on fatty meats so to make this stew more like a chili I add ground Turkey meat which makes it that hearty awesome Winter staple.

Its one of the best chili recipes i use. Im more on the carnivorous side but you dont even miss the meat with a chili like this. If you dont want It so spicy. Cut back on the chili powders. I would do it as is, and cool it with a dollop of sour cream

Chef John strikes again!  :)  This is not a recipe I would have picked for myself, but I needed something for a work potluck with vegan team members. Taking into account the changes I was forced to make (see below), it had a warm, rustic texture, wonderfully developed flavor, and not too much heat. My husband and I loved it, and several team members had the same comment.

Changes: (1) Substituted regular chili powder for ancho chili powder, and cayenne pepper for dried chipotle pepper (None of the four grocery stores I had time to visit had them.) (2) Used 1/2 the amount of jalapeno peppers, ancho chili powder, cumin, and oregano. (Because I realized I forgot to ask everyone if they were ok with spicy food. I know cumin and oregano aren't spicy, but I wanted to keep the ratios the same. ) 

Suggestions: For the vegetarians on the team, I brought plain greek yogurt instead of sour cream. That worked really well.

Positive: Phenomenal depth of flavor. Negative: Way too spicy! And I don't shy away from spice. I purposefully didn't do the chili powder on the sweet potatoes while roasting, omitted the jalapeno, and halved the ancho chili powder for my nursing baby's sake. And it was still ridiculously spicy. "Serve with sour cream" is a necessity, not a suggestion.

Our family loved this meal.  I did need to add quite a bit of water (maybe 2 cups), but it didn't affect the flavor of the chili, which was absolutely delicious.  I served it with sour cream, cilantro, and also a chopped bacon topping for the non-vegetarians.  In the future, I think I will cut back the sweet potato a little (from 3 to 2 potatoes) just as a personal preference.  Chef John never disappoints me!

I used less than a whole jalapeno and only one Tablespoon of the ancho  chili powder and the heat degree was just right. It had a spicy flavor but did not burn our taste buds. I would make this again.

Very, very tasty! I found this recipe after planning to make a similar one. This had more seasonings and appealed to me more. Didn't have any jalapeno, but will add it the next time around. Although I did roast the sweet potatoes, I didn't use any oil. A very satisfying dish that I'll make again and again!

I have probably made this 10 times now and shared it with at least 5.  It can be made ahead of time and refrigerated for a day or 2 - great for entertaining.  You don't miss the meat and feel better eating a "healthy" chili.

Really good.  I pretty much followed the recipe, but since I was making for my family (kids), I cut back on the spicy ingredients--regular chili powder and only 1/2 jalapeno w/o seeds.  Still had great flavor.  Even my picky daughter liked it (and she is a big meat eater).  Definitely think the roasting of the sweet potatoes makes the dish.

I made it tonight using Cooking in Russia's chili powder blend, and it was the second best chili I have ever put in my mouth. (The best was with beef shanks and beef broth.) This is going to be a staple in our house.

Another banger of a recipe from Chef John! I made this for my meal prep Sunday last week and oh my God - this will be my go-to veggie chili from now on. I didn't miss the meat at all, and it clocked in at just over 250 cals per serving without rice. Just go very sparingly on the oil and use fat free yogurt instead of sour cream for garnish.

My tweaks - I didn‚Äôt have any cornmeal, and I added a tablespoon of guajillo chili powder in addition to the ancho and chipotle, plus a rehydrated dried mulatto chili. I like my chili to be on the spicy side and this was perfect for me. I also added a quarter cup of Mrs Renfro‚Äôs green salsa as I needed to use it up.  I didn‚Äôt put in quite as much water for a thicker chili.  

This made about 8 servings. It‚Äôs filling enough to eat without rice, and it made a great filling for corn tortillas for awesome veggie tacos. It also works nicely as a spicy brunch dish if you add a bit more water, then poach an egg in it as you reheat, for a kind of Tex-Mex shakshuka.

This one wins every potluck I‚Äôve ever brought it to. (Winning a potluck means no leftovers to bring home!) it‚Äôs vegetarian and gluten-free and still flavorful and kicky and delicious. Everyone asks for the recipe, so I just print out several copies in advance to bring along!

Great recipe! I‚Äôll absolutely make it again. I only changed a couple things. I cooked up and added 6 chopped up pieces of bacon. And I used a chili and chipotle infused olive oil. I also used more dark chili seasoning and cumin bc I love a lot of flavor.

This was very easy to make and tasty! I was worried that the jalapeno and the spicy spices would make it too spicy for my family (not me, I love zippy food), but no one said it was too hot. We were home on a snow day with 10" of snow and it was the perfect dish!

Fantastic recipe! I did make a few changes, but it was out of necessity as I couldn't find a few of the spices. In lieu of chipotle powder on the sweet potatoes, I used a combination of smoked paprika and cayenne pepper. I also used veggie stock instead of water for extra flavor, and added a lot more liquid than the recipe calls for as I like my chili on the soupier side. Other than that, followed the recipe exactly and it was a hit with my meat loving family.

I made this with a few modifications - I omitted the chipotle pepper, onion, red bell pepper, jalapeno pepper, cornmeal, and sour cream. Instead of the ancho chili pepper I used diced up ancho chili pods. Despite not having these other ingredients It was not lacking in flavor at all! Yum!

I kept to the basic recipe and the outcome was a delicious chili which we enjoyed with thick slice of sourdough bread.  Since there's only two of us, there was a lot left over, so I've frozen the left overs and will have it over the next few weeks.  This is a fabulous meal for a damp, chilly fall or winter day.

Very easy and delicious. I cut the chili powder by about 40% and it was still plenty spicy but very good. This is very hearty and filling and of course very healthy with all of the ingredients. I didn‚Äôt have any white sugar but it worked just as well with brown sugar that I used as a substitute. I didn‚Äôt bother to simmer for 30 minutes, just 20 and I let it reheat with the beans and sweet potato for 7-8 minutes instead of 15 and everything was just fine.

Deeeee-licious. I used my crock pot. The only thing I prepared ahead of time were the yams.  I couldn't find ground dried chipotle pepper, so I used some from a can with sauce. Didn't know how much to add, so just guessed. Used two of the peppers, minced, and a little sauce, and tossed with the yams and other ingredients in that step. Baked as instructed. Turned out nice :) 

Other than the yams with chipotle, I just threw everything else in the crockpot and cooked them all together (including my beans - they were too firm as my rehydrating them didn't work out properly!). The spices came through so nicely given the long cook time.  I added the yams about 1/2 hour before I turned the crock pot off. The thickness of the chilli is divine.

Oh, and I added mushrooms. Because I love them. So much experimenting can be done with this in terms of bean and veggie combinations. You could even turn this into an amazing carnivorous dish by adding some shredded chicken thigh. So perfect for an autumn night!

It is a great basic recipe. I just added 2 of my chili staples; 1 cup of brewed coffee and a bottle of beer. 

I also added a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste because I thought there wouldn't be enough tomato taste. Big mistake! It made the chili way too sweet. I should have just trusted the recipe.

I agree that the sweet potato cubes right out of the oven were impossible to resist. I'm going to be making them a lot more.

This was my first meatless chili recipe and I don't think I'll have to find another one :)

Very good, but I modified it to my taste which is not everyone's, as I like spicy chilli.  I omitted the chocolate and starch.  I rolled the sweet potatoes in olive oil and a couple taps of adobo sauce.  Added a can of kidney beans and tomato paste.  Instead of a jalape√±o I chopped 1 chipotle pepper in  adobo sauce.  Instead of water I used vegetable broth.  I found I had to cook it longer than the suggested time, but turned out great!!

One of my  all time favorite meatless dishes. Can't say I change anything, though I do make it on the mild side. Hot sauce is added by  those that want heat. A meat option is to add shredded pork , chicken or favorite leftovers a garnish.

I've been looking for a "savoury" sweet potato dish and I found it.  I loved this recipe, and so did my fussy husband!  I suspect that the leftovers will be even more flavourful tomorrow.  I was intrigued by the cocoa powder and not sure what to expect, but WOW!  It is easy and cheap to make and is  on the "will make again" list.

The best chili hands down!!  I've added a few ingredients based on my families likes which helped make it a bit more filling & they are IN LOVE with this chili!!  1)I add a small can of tomato sauce, 2cups of water, instead of sugar, I add a natural syrup or some type of honey, lastly, I add  ground chicken. I'm telling you this dish is amazing! The baked, seasoned, sweet potatoes are the key!!  YUMMMM.....

Amazing!! I used regular chili powder, but other than that I stuck to the recipe. Wow! Even my toddler loved it! Will definitely keep this on a regular rotation. We had enough for two dinners! Served over rice with corn chips and corn bread on the side. And used plain Greek yogurt as a topping.

Have made it a few times now -  fantastic  and satisfying.  Made it verbatim the first time 'round, but have added a few modest changes since.
Tonight didn't have 2lbs worth of sweet potato, so added a cubed butternut squash along w/ my one lowly (yet giant) sw. potato and tossed it all up with half the the spices.
Used red wine in place of the h2O, added some sweet crisp corn near the end, and served with cilantro-yogurt and lime tortillas. 
Excellent!

I came to this after I had made sweet potatoes and black beans, looking to improve what had been intended for a burrito, and create a soup or stew instead.  I added strained tomatoes, chipotle sauce, and chocolate.  Spectacular.

As a Trader Joe's cook, next time I'll use TJs cuban black beans, TJ's fire roasted onions and peppers, and pretty much follow these directions for the potatoes and other spices.  I did use some honey in the sweet potato roasting pan, so no need for sugar later.

. I didn't have any cocoa powder. I never use it. I thought it would be wasteful to have to go out and buy a whole can just for one recipe. So I just threw in about 3-4 unsweetened chocolate chips.  No clue if this was enough or too much or if even did the trick.  I didn't LOVE it, but I really LIKED it!`

I didn't have fresh jalapenos so I used jalapeno powder and it tasted great. I also added a pound of lean ground beef and some chicken stock to stretch the broth.

This was phenomenal!

I've made this three times now and my three year old son and husband absolutely love it! There's rarely enough for me to have a second bowl because they devour their second helpings quickly. My mother in law was visiting once when I made it and she said it was the best chili she's ever had. I like it a lot too! I always use a crockpot and let it simmer on high for an hour. I don't sautee the onions and pepper, just throw them in and they soften. I also don't use a jalape√±o just because I think it's give it too much spice for my son. I never have Ancho chili powder but use chipotle chili powder instead and it works well! And a quick note, you can omit the sugar of you'd like. I've made it both ways, and you can't tell a difference but be sure to roast the sweet potatoes because the flavor is great! Next time, I'll be smart and double the recipe so I have left overs ;)

For a deeper flavor and heartier texture, I pureed about 1/4 of the roasted sweet potatoes then threw them into the pot along with a beef bullion cube and 2 teaspoons of molasses.  Delicious!

Me and hubby are doing a 2 week no meat menu to start. Made this and it was delicious! Had to gradually add about a cup more of water, but other than that, it was a great recipe to make. Luckily I had all the ingredients.....even the sour cream and cilantro to tip it with. Also topped it a green onions.  Can't wait to try it again tomorrow when all the spices blend together.

This was delicious, got rave reviews!  It was a bit labor intensive, but worth the effort.  I did make a few changes: I added ground beef and had to increase the amount of all the spices as it was a little bland as written.  I definitely agree that roasting the sweet potatoes is a MUST as this makes the chili.

I loved it!  I didn't have dried chipotle pepper so I left that out and I couldn't find dried ancho chile but I purchased dried ancho chiles and chopped one up and added it.  I think my jalape√±o pepper was rather hot enough.  It was spicy, but we like it like that. Good, healthy dish.

We love the black bean-sweet potato combination in our home. Roasting the potatoes kept them from melting away in the pot. Yummy! Skipped the ancho, cornmeal and sugar...didn't need the extra heat for us, didn't have cornmeal and didn't think it needed added sweetness of sugar. Used vegetable broth for the water and it was greatly enjoyed! Thank you!!!

Being from the southwest, of course I changed this recipe for items on hand. Used roasted Hatch green chili, no jalapeno or Ancho; 1 ear of sweet corn cut off the cob; added diced chicken breast; this is a good recipe as is, but I couldn't help myself.

I have to say this is AMAZING!!!!  I tried it as I can't eat gluten or soy, so I'm always looking for something adventurous.  It really is absolutely one of the best chilis I've ever made.  The flavors are complex and really one of the best chilis I've had, never mind meatless.   I added a bit of habanero, not jalape√±o.  We like spicy here so that adds to our stars.  We used cilantro to top it off and sour cream for those who can have dairy in our household.  I'm not one to rave about a recipe, but this one rocks!!

I toned down the spiciness by using Anaheim peppers instead of jalapenos and no cayenne pepper.  Otherwise followed the rest of the recipe.

Family members who did not like sweet potatoes even liked it!  Was a hit with our vegan friends.  Definitely would make again!

Call me crazy, but I made this per the recipe and didn't change a thing and it was great.  Actually, I've made this 5 or 6 times over the past 2 years,  and bring it to work as a complete 1 dish lunch.  Occasionally I've been short an ingredient and substituted things (kidney for black beans once) and its still worked well. Love Chef John.

Delicious! We will definitely be making this again! I am a heat-wimp, so I cut out a bunch of the chili powders, and I removed the seeds from the jalape√±o. We used one can black beans and one can kidney, just because of what we have in the house. Yummy!

This is a recipe that is even better the day after. All of it sits and ruminates! There were a few things I didn't have and decided not to use (cocoa powder, jalapeno, etc). I did use Rotel in this. But, honestly the spices you have, the sweet potato and the black beans make it quite tasty!

Excellent cold-weather comfort food. I make is three or four times during the winter. The jalopeno goes a long way and I adjust the amount of that ingredient depending on how spicy I want the chili to turn out.

Absolutely amazing.  Everyone raved about it.  Lots of ingredients but not a ton of work.  I did, however, leave out some of the peppers per other reviewers' suggestions.

I didn't have the ancho chili powder, so I substituted 1 Tbsp chipotle chili pepper.  Soup was okay, but not so amazing that i wanted more.  I did, however, have extra sweet potatoes, and those were amazing plain!!!  I think I'll keep this recipe, but probably only to make the roasted sweet potatoes - they had a BBQ chip taste.  YUM!

So delicious it was hard to stop eating it.  I used 1/2 tsp salt, not one tsp.  Discard the jalapeno seeds.  Omit the sour cream and cilantro, they take away from the chili, not add.  This is considerable work to put together, advise doing advance prep of ingredients and preparing over a couple days.

I've made this a few times and everyone LOVES IT! Never anything left :-) I like how hearty and 'meaty' it tastes...without the meat. Thank you so much for sharing this Chef John. Do share any other veggie/vegan recipes you have. Much gratitude!

This is an excellent filling meal! And, it allows me to feed everyone, as my son is a vegan. The only change I am going to make is to use gluten -free cornmeal, as I have gluten-free family members!

Great recipe! I left out the jalepenos and cayenne as we don't like spicy. I also added a can of plain tomato sauce. We used chick peas as that's all we had at home. And I added 1/2 c frozen corn kernels. Delicious!

Loved, loved, loved it!! I made it for a Merry Christmas Eve celebration and wasn't sure how it'd turn out, but it was super delish. I followed the basics of the recipe, but I always add more garlic and onions to recipes. I also roasted parsnips and butternut squash instead of the sweet potato, added corn, and did a black bean/ chick pea combo instead of just black beans. May sound like a lot of changes, but that's the beauty of the recipe, it can easily be tweaked to suit your cravings and be a big hit. Enjoy!!! P.S. def. has a nice spice level that I loved, but watch out of you're sensitive to the heat monster.

Very happy with the results! I thought I had everything I needed but had ran out of ancho so I used regular chili powder. I love ancho and would have been even better with it. I only added a few slices of jalapeno because I'm sharing with a group and don't want to make it too spicy in case someone is a sissy and can't handle it. Everything else I followed exactly and I will definitely make again!

Fantastic!  I made this for a Chili cook-off lunch.  It was nice to have a meatless chili option.  I read the comments and decided to skip the Chipotle powder and I used only half of the Ancho chili powder.  Next time (there will be a next time, for sure) I will use a little more of the Ancho chili powder .

This is great! It is non-traditional: a bit like a cross between a chili and a really hearty stew. Roasting the sweet potatoes is key (and I have done this step on its own as a fall vegetable side by itself - fabulous!). You can make this recipe straight as written or you can add small chunks of chicken breast. I tend to like a bit of acid in my stews, so I also add a small splash of white balsamic vinegar at the very end - it is slightly spicy, sweet and bright! Everyone raves, and like all stews and chills it is better on the second day if there is any left. Thank you Chef John!

I followed the recipe pretty faithfully, lessening salt and sugar just a bit.  I also used 1/2 a large serrano pepper without ribs or seeds, as we are pretty wimpy when it comes to heat.  I'm sure the full measure would please many.  The flavor is complex and the mouth tastes many flavors as you eat it.   I will make it again.

Five stars isn't enough for this dish. We love spicy so we doubled the spices and OMGoodness this chili is by far and away my favorite. We left the potatoes in a bit longer just so they didn't get soggy and we weren't disappointed. We made this chili multiple times last season and we are excited to see chili season come around again.

Easy to adjust to make it mildly spicy. I left out  the jalepeno and only used 1T Ancho chile powder (1/2 suggested). I also followed another users suggestion to use 1T of sugar and add it before roasting the sweet potatoes. Even thought I cut the sweet potatoes into fairly small chunks (about 1/2 in.), I had to roast them for 40 min, not the 20 - 25 suggested in order for them to start to caramelize and be fully cooked. I'll definitely make this again.

Its a great recipie that's fun to mix up with other chili peppers and hot sauces. I like to change up the type of chili peppers or sauce depending on how much heat I feel like. It's delicouse very time! Also, it's well worth the extra time to bake the potatoes first!

I enjoy sweet potatoes and I was looking forward to trying this recipe. The strong and spicy taste of the chile covered  the flavor of the sweet potatoes. I will not be making this recipe again.

This was very tasty.  I didn't have ancho or chipotle chili or jalapeno (kids don't like hot), so I used diced green chilis and a different chili powder.  I loved the smokey flavor of the chipotle chili powder (I did have that).  Very hardy.  I think the recipe should say 6-8 servings, not 4 'cause that would be way too much of a portion size.  I also added some frozen corn for color and taste.  I never would have thought to put sweet potatoes in chili but I loved it.

This was a great alternative to regular chili! It was pretty spicy though so I substituted the ancho chile powder for regular chili powder and left out the jalapeno pepper. Also 2 pounds of sweet potatoes were too many, 1-1.5 would have been plenty.

This is delicious!  Chef John's recipes are always wonderful.  I did add some lean hamburger for my son-in-law, about 1 cup more water with a TB of beef bouillon and a healthy handful of frozen corn. I also used Penzeys Chili 3000 in place of the spices.  It is perfect for a chilly n breezy January night!  Thank you for sharing the recipe :)

Very good if you leave out all the pepper and salt.  It is still very flavorful.   I chopped about 1/2 cup of cilantro and added it in at the end.  Everyone loved this dinner, kids too!  The meat eaters added chopped grilled chicken breasts to their chili.

In step 4, spices clump and stick to bottom of pan if added as instructed.  Spices should be added after vegetables are cooked.

I made this as written so I could give it a fair review. I liked it but felt like it needs a little tweaking. I'm one of those that usually needs to go extra on spices and herbs so that will be one thing I try next time. All in all, a good healthy chili. I also did not find it too hot at all. Thanks, Chef John, for another good recipe!

I've made this twice and it is our new favorite Chili.  It's a lot of work to make, but it makes a lot and we have it for a few nights for dinner.  I used the Jalapeno but took out the seeds.  I use the Chipolte pepper as directed but I don't put in as much of the Ancho chili pepper.  I also added a can of corn (drained) and that gave it a little more texture.  Yes, it's a lot of cutting and chopping, but it is worth it.

Everyone loved this!  I cut the ancho chili powder in half and used small  jalapeno and diced (without seeds, of course) instead of slicing..  Also used one square of unsweetened chocolate bar instead of cocoa powder.  Just the right enough spice for all.  The texture was fabulous too.  The cost outlay was high due to special seasonings i did not have, but i figure it will cost about $15 the next time i make it!  One of the  reviews said there was too much slicing and dicing, but for me, that's the great part about preparing a meal!  Next time i think i will double the recipe so i will have plenty leftover!

This is very good, but even with eliminating some of the spicy seasonings (jalepeno and hot pepper), it was still pretty spicy for me.  I will make it again but tone it down even more.  Adding the sour cream is a must to finish out the flavors.

I followed this recipe exactly. I had to search to find the ancho chile powder, but it was SO worth it.  Spectacular recipe! The roasted sweet potato is an amazing complement to the various peppers (ancho, chipotle and jalapeno).  I did not find this too spicy at all (of course, I do quite a bit of Indian cooking so I may be a bit immune to the "fire") and have recommended this recipe to many people.  It freezes well, too, which is great for me since I live alone. I may add frozen kernel corn to the next batch. I'm making a point of searching out other recipes from Chef John. Love this!

This recipe is superb! Used a mixture of orange & purple skinned (yellow inside) sweet potatoes called kumara in New Zealand where I'm from. Used two cans of Delmaine Black Beans in Chilli Sauce plus two cans of diced tomatoes so only added 1 tsp chilli flakes & third of a sachet of taco seasoning. Cut the cumin down to 1 heaped tsp. Other ingredients the same but different brands. What a beautiful, velvety chilli! The prep is worth it but have made it ahead of time to get all the flavours when friends arrive tomorrow night. Will serve with steamed rice & salad. Omitted the sugar & water. Thankyou Chef John.

We have made this over & over.  Amazing.  
The only changes we made to it was that we used the southwest black beans that already have the jalapenos inside the can.  This adds a bit of heat that we love.  The other change was that instead of sour cream we used Greek Yogurt Cheese. This gives it a real ZING! Mmm! (Use 1/3 or 1/2 of the block of Yogurt Cheese)
It truly does eat like a meat dish.  Meat-eaters won't miss the meat, I promise.  So many flavors & so good for you!

Wow.  Just awesome. I didn't have a fresh bell pepper on hand so used some frozen tri-color bell peppers, added them in at the end with the beans and potatoes. Used a whole tsp oregano too, I love the stuff. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  The texture was spot on, that step of roasting the sweet potatoes really makes a difference.  I've never had ancho chili powder that was very hot so I used the recipe amount.  The finished dish was not that hot to me.  At first I was taken aback by the large caloric number here, until I realized this recipe thinks it's 4 servings. I'll get at least 6 servings out of this, it makes a pretty big pot.  When I use my own software to determine nutrition for 6 servings I get 350 calories, 6g fat, 68g carb, 14g fiber, 12g protein.  Now that makes more sense.  Anyway, I love this dish and will make it often.  Thanks Chef John!

This recipe was 4 stars as written (omitting the jalape√±o and decreasing chili powder). It definitely would need more liquid to be chili/soup like. What I did that made it delicious? Added a little leftover corn, then put it in a greased 13x9. I mixed up a batch of my regular CORNBREAD (buttermilk cornbread on this site), and used a little less sugar and a handful of shredded cheese. Spread the cornbread mix on top, and bake at.  375 for 20-25 min until golden. Add a dollop of sour cream and it is absolutely divine!

This was absolutely delicious!  I accidentally grabbed white sweet potatoes at the grocery and used those, and they were extra sweet and wonderful with the spicy chipotle powder.  Will definitely make this again!

I have been experimenting with a lot of vegetarian dishes since my meat loving hubby turned vegan for better health.  This is the best dish by far.  I love spicy dishes, so all of the hot spices are a plus.  I am still looking for more dishes, but this one is rotated regularly.

This recipe is amazing!! I prefer white sweet potatoes so I used both white and regular. The natural sweetest of the white sweet potatoes really made this for me. Everyone that has tasted this says it should be in a restaurant. Amazing recipe! Thx for sharing

Just won first place in a Chili Cookoff with this recipe!  I did cut back on the chili powder by half and used a small jalapeno.  Still had plenty of heat! And I loved the taste of the chipotle pepper.

We didn't use cocoa powder, cayenne pepper or corn meal. We only used one table spoon of chili powder and 3/4 teaspoon of cumin. And just a tiny bit of the jalapeno pepper. This was perfect. The chili was so flavorful! Absolutely out of this world good!! Not too spicy , just perfect. The sweet potatoes mixed in with all of these ingredients was amazing! I will definitely be making this again!!

This chili was fantastic! The Kids loved it. I used fresh black beans by soaking them overnight in water to soften them. The Sweet potato was a great relish to all the spices. Loved it!!! Sharon S.

This is so good!  I was a little scared by some of the reviews that said this was too spicy, so I toned it down by using two tablespoons of regular chili powder instead of ancho chili powder.  I added a tsp. of ancho chili powder.  I used a Serrano pepper in place of the Jalapeno and removed some of the seeds.  Also, I didn't have any dried chipotle pepper, so I used Mrs. Dash Southwest chipotle seasoning instead.  Regardless of the changes I made, it was one of the best chilis we've ever eaten!  If you want to add meat, I'm sure chorizo would be a perfect addition--I'll probably try that next time.  While this recipe is time-consuming, it is well worth it!

And my husband loved it to. Made this both organic and gluten free and my husband didn't even miss the meat. We both agree it was delicious and filling. Taste better and spicier after a day of sitting in the fridge.

Everyone loved it and asked me for the recipe. The recipe is best served the next day when the ingredients merge. I didn't have chipolte peppers and jalapeno so I substituted 1 crushed dried red hot pepper and 1 dried jalapeno I grew in my garden last summer (removed seeds), a shake of pizza peppers and half a thinly sliced fresh poblano pepper. It was splendid!

I was looking at the nutritional values of this and it seems quite high.  600 calories per serving?  Does that come from the potatoes or the beans.  There doesnt seem to be much else that would account for it.  I would love to try this but being on Weight Watchers and computing points of 12 I am hesitant.  What is the serving size?

I already reviewed this recipe, but just had to add something: I was asked to make this dish twice in the SAME week!  You KNOW it's good when it gets requested twice in the same week, especially in my house.  Chef John, you scored a winner with this one!

I made this recipe while following the video, and did not realize the amount of chipotle pepper was as little as the recipe called for, so my chili turned out a little hotter than it was supposed to, I'm sure... but not a problem, as instead of just using the sour cream for garnish, I actually added about 1/4 cup to the chili to help tame the heat, and it turned out really creamy and delish - I will do this addition again when I make it, even though I will now go easier on the pepper.... other than that, it was a really hearty and delicious dish. I served this with the 'Mexican Corn Bread' recipe found on this site.... and it was a fantastic combination!

This is awesome!!  I used 3 canned chipotle peppers and about a Tablespoon of the adobo sauce in place of the jalapeno and the ancho chile powder, because I had that on hand and also because I prefer the smokey flavor of the chipotle pepper.  Also followed the other reviewers and left out the white sugar.  It was delicious!  I will definitely make it again!

I have made this twice, and it is wonderful!  The sweet potatoes add so much to the dish. Now I can't imagine eating any other type of chile.  I added about 3/4 lbs ground turkey to the dish, which I enjoy.
I like the spicyness of the dish--it is not overpowering at all.

This was incredible!  I added chicken, just because but it would be fine without it.  After my husband and I ate it I roasted some more sweet potatoes and added a little more of everything.  I then had him bring it to the office the next day.  I asked how everyone liked it.  Comments were: "the best chili I ever had", "great, minus the sweet potatoes", and one didn't waste any time and went straight to my Pinterest page to get the recipe!!!

This is great. I doubled recipe but only had one 28oz can of diced tomatoes so added a 14 oz can of stewed tomatoes I had on hand. I used only one cup of water. That was the only change. Fabulous.

I made this for the first time and I have to say I was not disappointed. I used grape seed oil instead of olive (i prefer the flavor of it) and served it with some cornbread. It was a huge hit with my friend who is a picky eater. I can't wait to eat it for leftovers after it has sat for a day!!

This is great stuff.  I did the sweet potatoes like he said, but I put everything else but the black beans in a crock pot and let it cook for several hours.  I then added the sweet potatoes and black beans about 30 minutes prior to serving.  It is VERY spicy (I like it that way!), so you may want to go easy on the chipotle and/or seed the jalapeno.  We'll be making this again!

OMG. This is the best chili recipe I've ever made. Even the kids liked it. I cut out the jalapeno and cut the chile powder if half to suit them and it was just the right amount of heat.  I added a pound of ground buffalo, browned with the onions and garlic, then threw it all into the crock pot. Added the sweet potatoes near the end.  Really wonderful.

Very tasty. Used half sweet potato and half butternut squash because it's what I had. The texture of the sweet potato was much better. Next time I'll try doubling the cocoa.

I served this at a dinner this fall and everyone loved it.
I didnot use chipotle, as some don't really care for it. So I just used reg chilli powder. The fresh cilantro makes it taste so fresh!!

I adjusted this recipe for 6 servings. It was a hit with my husband and 3 adult kids that dropped in to visit.  I loved the roasted sweet potatoes and it was so worth that step.  I followed the recipe exactly as written except I did not have cornmeal and omitted it entirely.  I added a 3rd can of beans (pinto) which gave the chili more variety, and also added 1 Tablespoon of chili powder.  I also cut up 4 boneless chicken breasts, saut√©ed them in olive oil, salt and pepper, then followed the recipe with the onions, etc.   I will make this version again.  Thanks for all the comments and a good recipe!

This is one of the most beautiful and delicious soups I have ever tried! We didn't have ancho chili powder but we did have poblano peppers. We  sauteed the diced poblano pepper and didn't miss the powder at all. Otherwise I followed this recipe exactly and it was amazing! The only problem we had was that the roasted sweet potatoes with chipotle chili powder were so yummy, that many of them didn't make it into the soup! They are a wonderful snack or side dish on their own! Yum!

Oh my goodness, this is such a delicious meal. If I could I would give it 6 stars. The only thing I did different,  I bought the beans and soaked them overnight. beside that I followed the directions of recipe

Wonderful!  Rather than roast the potatoes, I just cubed them and partially cooked them and let them finish cooking in the soup.  I also substituted chicken broth for the water to give it a little more flavor.  Super on a chilly night!!

Made this for my family last night, following the directions completely, which is odd for me. The taste was great but the texture of the dish was such that I probably will not make it again. I need meat in my chili! Anyways, great flavor, great look, four stars.

This is a keeper, wonderful taste and deep flavor. You crank the heat up or down by using the ingredients listed. Amazing and such a healthly dish to make for a cold fall day!

I really liked the taste.  With all the peppers and other ingredients, I thought it would turn out to be too hot. but it actually was very tasty with only a small amount of a heat after taste.  I wanted to make the recipe as stated even though I thought it would be too hot, but I was pleasantly surprised.  It was surprisingly easy to put together with all the detailed instructions so that even a non-cook like me could make it. I did clean the seeds out of the jalapeno pepper, but I am definitely going to make this chili for the next potluck I go to, as there are a few vegetarians (including me)who will enjoy it as well.

Very good...but I could see that it might easily be way too spicy for some.  Could not find any ancho chili powder at the local market...so I left that out.  The jalapenos from my garden this year are unpredictable... it took me 4 to find one with some heat... that one I deseeded....but I used all 4 peppers for the bright green color because it looked so nice :-)..... (also chopped up a couple of small yellow/orange peppers to add for the color).  Thought the toppings of sour cream, cilantro and some raw onion really added to the dish.  Served with a mixed green salad and some saltines.  Will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I eliminated the jalapeno pepper because it may have made this too spicey for the kids. I also made some pearled barley to serve with on the side and my 6 year old and 4 year old ate it all! I am glad I found this recipe as I am changing my diet to vegetarian and introducing my kids to a whole new way of eating healthy with the extra fiber from the sweet potato, beans and barley.

This recipe is great!  I love the sweet potatoes and the black beans.  Will adjust spiciness when I make it next time to suit my taste, but very happy with the ease of making, the finished meal, and, most of all, it is delicious and healthy. -- George

Very tasty and delicious. I liked the touch of the semi-hard (as opposed to mushy) baked sweet potatoes.

Wow, I made this recipe and the kitchen just smelled wonderful.  The guys all looked at it questioningly, not so sure about the sweet potatoes, but they liked it !
