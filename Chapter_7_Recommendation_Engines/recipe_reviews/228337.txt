I used popcorn flavourings, rather than the yeast, to get the cheese flavour. Although the yeast is fine, I am not a fan of it! I tossed mine in a bit of olive oil, and salted lightly with sea salt, but will add garlic, or seasoning of sorts next time. I'm thinking about salad seasoning, like Mrs Dash or others. I get a seasoning that is for Greek dishes which would be great on the kale. I also used parchemnt on the sheet when baking, as I can mist with my oil mister, and sprinkle the seasoning on easily. Cleanup is a breeze.

These are excellent!  Thanks for delicious way to enjoy kale.  If you don't have nutritional yeast use parmesan.

This was insanely fantastic and addicting.  I made 5 batches - it was all gone within 24 hours, am now having to make more.  Thank goodness there is lots of free kale in the garden.  This was enjoyed on ALL ages from 5-70.  Even the little kids who were saying "ew" when picking the kale and watching me make it absolutely loved it and I had to take them away!

Absolutely incredibly awesome!  Brewers Yeast is awesome on these!  My baking times are 20 min - flip kale & rotate baking pans - 30 min - flip kale & rotate baking pans - then 20 min.
I've made this recipe 4 times now and have the perfect baking times down  :)

This is a really easy, simple, and delicious recipe.  I gave my kale a little "massage" to help spread the olive oil around before I added the nutritional yeast and salt to help it stick.  I also found it helpful to use parchment on my baking sheet for easy cleanup.

As a side note, I made and reviewed this recipe exactly as written.  You can't substitute popcorn seasoning for the main ingredient (other than kale) in this recipe and expect to get the same results.  It's a totally different recipe.

Loved it!  

Instead of just salt and nutritional yeast, I used the recipe for parmesan-like sprinkles:

1/2 cup yeast flakes
1/2 cup ground sesame seeds
2 t garlic powder
1 t onion powder
1 T chicken-like seasoning or salt
1 T lemon juice

Very yummy. The whole family loves these! 
I put it all in a gallon ziplock bag, it was much easier to make sure the seasons distributed evenly that way, and your hands don't get dirty; plus then the kids could help. :)

Yum!  I made four batches: 2 exactly as the recipe called for, one with just olive oil and sea salt, and one with sesame oil, sesame seed and garlic salt.  My seven year old daughter ate the entire first batch and came  back for more.  My favorite of the 3 is this one with nutritional yeast. Thanks!

I used Dino Kale.  It is a sweeter Kale that I use in Salads and it was great in the Kale chips.  Be careful not to use to much Sea Salt.  Use as much nutritional yeast as you want as it gives it that cheesy flavor (I use nutritional yeast on popcorn, yummy)  I baked these but I will try a dehydrator next time. I buy Kale Chips commercially and they are an expensive snack. I wanted to make them myself.  This recipe was easy.  These chips were delicious and addictive.  What a wonderful low calorie and healthy snack to have on hand to serve to family and friends!!

this is truly the best recipe out there. I've tried a few other recipes (well rated ones) and they all say to heat the oven to 300 instead of two hundred. this crisps them faster, but they also get soggy and gross much faster after! whereas cooking them at a lower temperature and keeping them in twice as long results in a MUCH better texture, and they stay crispy for as long as you have them! this is the only perfect kale chip recipe I've found. for real. I've never written a review here before and I've been here for 3 years. that's how serious I am right now.

These are delicious. I sometimes also add garlic powder, cumin and onion powder, if I'm in the mood for super-flavorful chips.
Great for portable vegetables! I'm not a fan of raw veggies, so these are a great alternative. I pack them in bag lunches.

I tried to make the recipe with some of the add-ins for the paremsan-like sprinkles from another reviewer. I thought this to be ok, but not great. I like the technique of cooking it slower, though it means you have to wait a lot longer for the chips to be ready. I also placed the chips on a cooling rack while cooking to produce a more even crisp and to negate the need for turning. Perhaps it is just my taste buds, I love, love the maple chips and will be applying this slower method to them, but I found the taste while not inedible, not very enjoyable.

I have flat-leafed kale and they were paper-thin so the texture was off-putting but the taste was okay.

AWESOME! I keep trying to like kale. I have quit trying "chips" because of lousy results, until now. Had to dig out the dehydrator but what a perfect match!  Thank you so much!!!

Great recipe! So much more economical than buying ready-made at the natural foods store.  I crush up some cashew nuts to mix with the yeast and give it some more "grab" and substance on the kale.  I've tried making kale chips several ways, and this low-temp method seems to be a lot easier. I don't have to "babysit" them so much to prevent scorching.  Thanks for sharing!

I bought some commercially made chips last week and loved them so I thought they must be easy to make!  They are!  I used the oven to dehydrate and just a sprinkle of Thai seasoning in addition to the yeast, instead of salt.  Delicious!!! Thanks for the awesomely easy recipe!  Make sure to buy a couple bunches of kale... The first one will be gone as soon as they're done!

If my oven was big enough I would make 10 batches at a time. It's easier to make if you put the olive oil and nutritional yeast at the bottom of the bowl and put the kale on top to mix, much easier to get it evenly distributed.

Did this recipe almost exactly as written - my oven crisped the kale up nicely in 40 minutes that was the only difference. I won't have enough to save until tomorrow because I can't stop eating it - SO delicious.

This was super yummy!!! Next time, I'm going to try garlic salt!  I bet that would be great too!  Great cheesy flavor with the Nut yeast :)  I put mine in my dehydrator about 115 to start, then hour later I turn it up to 135 .  Total dry time was about 3 hours and they were very crispy!  Thanks!!

Very addictive! I have some more in the oven as I type. My boys love them and requested I go get more Kale. Very simular taste to pumpkin seeds. I added some garlic salt. I know the batch in the oven will be good because they tasted good even before going in the oven.

I've made this several times and we all love it!  Like someone else mentioned, I add the oil to the kale in a large bowl and massage the kale to get it more evenly distributed and to help the seasoning stick to more of the kale.  Then I add the seasoning, which I've experimented with too.  I love the nutritional yeast, but also add some parmesan cheese and garlic powder to mine.  Sometimes I also add Trader Joe's "21 Seasoning Salute" for a little more of a "kick."  I line the baking sheets with parchment paper and then set cooling racks on top of that.  The racks help keep the kale more curled instead of flattening out  on the bottom of the pan and prevent any need to turn the chips in the middle of the baking process. (Rotating the pans is still advised.)  This is definitely a keeper!  --A great way to use all that kale from the garden and a way healthier snack than potato chips cooked in GMO-laden oils!

These chips are good just need to get use to them, they are a bit different. I haven't had kale before or the nutritional yeast. It taste like a cross between a cheddar and a parmesan cheese. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

I'm sitting here eating the chips between keystrokes. I did make a substitution, though. Instead of plain kale, I soaked about about a cup of organic edamame beans (soy) for an hour, pureed them in the oil/yeast mixture, and then used the mix to coat the kale.

This adds a little to the drying and crisping time (about 10 minutes). But I'm telling you, these are every bit as good as what people are paying $5.99/bag for at health food stores.

I really just use the basic recipe.  I like to throw cheese and ranch powder on them.  It's a fun, healthy snack to play around with.

I have to try again....my oven baked it in 20 minutes and I needed more salt. I tried it with Tahiti and sesame oil. Will get brewer's yeast for next try. All in all I am a fan.

Super simple, super easy, and a great way to use kale that’s gone a little limp in your crisper. I’m a big cheesehead, and the nutritional yeast gave me the cheesy flavor I was looking for. A healthier, low-carb alternative to potato chips. Think I’ll experiment with other seasonings and flavorings.

I had kale from my garden that wasn’t the curly-kale and it worked out just great. although, next time I might use more kale or less of the nutrient yeast because it was a little bit stronger than I’d like. definitely a great recipe that I will be using often.

These chips were delish.  Used dinosaur kale instead of curly and avocado oil because that's what I had in hand.

Loved this recipe, super easy but only cooked mine for 30 minutes and came out perfect. You can also make this without the yeast if you would like, just use salt and olive oil it will still be delicious!

Oh goodness. Highly addictive!! Kept me from snacking on bad items.
I did increase oven to 300 and just watch and rotate pans for even baking. I baked it at 300 (convection) for 20 min. then rotated for about 13 more minutes ...Yum! Worth making more than one batch at a time. Too easy not to!

I definitely did it wrong the first time, by making the oven way too hot, and putting far too much salt than I should have.  But had I made it exactly as the recipe calls for, I think it would have been great.  I'll try it again!

Scumdidilyumtious! The first tray a made came out a little too greasy so  used only about  2 tsp or less olive oil on the next batch. I also just tossed the kale in the olive oil and Romano cheese seasoning blend instead of canola and yeast. I definitely will make these again.

These are easy and tasty!  I've made them twice.  The second time I didn't have as much yeast and honestly I liked them better that way.  I added a little cayenne pepper to  the first batch and some Berbere seasoning to the second batch.  I'll try them again with different seasonings.
WAY more economical than buying kale chips, and you know exactly what you put into them.

I was trying to find ways to incorporate kale into my diet, since I just hate it so much. I tried these kale chips, using my air fryer, addicting! tasted like popcorn to me.

I made it exactly as written and thought they turned out very nicely.  The taste was good - not too salty or bitter.  The kale chips had a nice crunch to them and just the right amount of cheese.  I've made them twice thus far and will continue to do so in the future.

Used Red Robin Seasoned Salt, because I had some in my spice cabinet, and increased the cooking  temperature  to 300°, because I'm impatient.  Three of us promptly devoured the entire batch!

Wonderful,  addictive, and kid-approved! Wait, whaaaat? Kid-approved KALE??  Yes, this treat went down their gullet with nary a complaint.  Instead of tossing in a bowl, I put the torn kale in a zip lock bag with the kale and oil, then massaged  to coat. Easy peasy.

Maybe I was expecting something different. The yeast didn't give it a cheesy flavor and absolutely stank up my house to the point where my kids were not excited to try it bc of the smell. It did not taste bad and did have a great crunch but I also could not shake the feeling that I'd cooked out all the nutritional value. I think I will stick to raw or lightly sautéed kale in future.

Good basic recipe. The kale shrinks ALOT though so you don't end up with a lot of chips, but it's much cheaper to make them at home than to buy pre-made ones. I want to try this again with some cashew pieces.

Amazingly addicting.  My family loves these.  I made using a gallon bag and massaged the oil into the kale and then added nutritional yeast and sea salt and shook.  A food dehydrator is the way to go if you have one.
