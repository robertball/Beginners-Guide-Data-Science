My son used this recipe for one of his 4-H enteries last year and received a blue ribbon.  I personal thought it could have been a little sweeter.  Make sure the bananas are VERY ripe.

This turned out perfect! I followed this recipe to a "t", only adding a touch of nutmeg AND cinnamon. Great, great, great!

This came out very tasty, though I only tasted it by itself, not ON anything.  I quartered the recipe because I only had 3 bananas, which was a little over 1 cup mashed.  I added a sprinkle of cinnamon and a few drops of vanilla extract.  Thanks for this recipe, I'm sure I'll make it again someday!

This was very easy to make, though it did take quite a few ripe bananas to get up to 4 cups. It was very delicious and seemed to taste the best on pancakes. I tried putting it on scrambled eggs and that tasted good too. *Yes, I do have odd tastes* My entire family loved it, and it is much healtheir then the usual syrup we use.

Excellent! My kids love jam sandwiches and I made this, as we had run out of store bought jam. I think we will keep doing this instead - they love it and its affordable!  Only thing is I wasn't sure how long to leave it on the stove top and don't think I left it on long enough, and I also burnt it a bit initially because I had the stove top too hot.  Very yummy though!

The result of this recipe was definitely edible, but I feel like it could have been so much better. Even when using a measuring cup to add all the ingredients, I found the lemon taste to be too strong. I will probably halve the amount next time. Adding a touch of cinnamon (as suggested by other reviewers) was definitely a nice touch.

Yay! I looked all over the internets for a recipe like this! I wanted to find a yummy banana spread (for toast) that didn't involve another fruit - just bananas. I just wasn't sure what all could go into it (I lack creative juice when it comes to food) until I found this recipe. Now, I didn't follow it *exactly* because I just guestimated the amounts of each ingredient as I wanted to make this with just one banana. If you do all this *to taste* you can get a wonderfully banana-y flavor with a a kick of nutmeg (and cinnamon - I took that advice). I also took the advice to use a very ripe banana. They're half way to mush anyways, and much sweeter. ALSO, what added to the deliciousness was texture: don't blend this up! Hand-mush that fruit and you will get some lovely lumps of banana-y goodness. ALSO, I didn't cook this. Don't know how long it will keep, but I jarred the little extra that I had and stuck it in the fridge... we'll see! Maybe I'll try cooking it up next time.

This recipe is an excellent alternative to making banana bread for using up over-ripe bananas! We have definitely enjoyed this both times I have made it, although I can't imagine having enough old bananas in order to be able to have 4 cups worth once mashed: so the recipe was quartered the first time, and halved the second, and both were still very yummy warm on French toast!

i wasn't a big fan, however, it was a hit with those who received this jam as Christmas gifts.  For that reason I will keep this in my arsenal of homemade gifts.
