Very good, in our opinion it is very sugary.  Instead of using instant coffee we used 8oz of liquid coffee syrup that you make with a toddy coffee maker.

I decided to try out a homemade liqueur to see what it would taste like, not knowing what it would taste like I reduced the quantity substantially. I didn't have any vanilla beans so this one looked pretty easy given I had vanilla extract. I wanted the flavor to be a little bit more intense so I used an instant espresso. This was good, but I really do think a Vanilla Bean would've enhanced the flavor more.
