This is a good, old-fashioned deviled egg with a little chopped celery and red onion to give it some crunch.  Nothing not to like here!

FAAAAR too thin.  It comes out to a syrup consistency.  You could POUR it into the eggs.  Had to boil 6 more at the last minute to thicken it up.

The mixture needs to be thicker. Maybe next time I'll cut back on the mayo & add just a pinch of salt.

1 cup of mayo is way too much............1 or 2 tablespoons is plenty for this recipe. This is the fifth recipe from your site that has been way off when it lists the ingredients.

The consistency is too weak. Too runny. I would have used one cup or maybe even half a cup of mayo, had I known. Not what I wanted at all. sadly I do not have any more eggs to boil and makes to thicken it with :(  Need to add salt for taste.  I honestly believe they forgot to add salt to the recipe.

Very good easy recipe however I added some sweet pickle relish and a bit of sugar to taste. I also just used some celery seed instead of fresh celery because I didn't have any fresh on hand.

I made this with half of the Mayo, and added finely chopped gherkins and Dill to the mix. They were a huge hit.

I like the simplicity of this recipe, but next time I would change the ratios. The mixture was thin and much more “liquid” than I would like, and I had almost double the mixture I needed to simply fill the eggs. I even put extra mixture on the eggs and still had a bunch left over. I would definitely do less mayo in the future.

The consistency was very thin so added 6 more eggs  . Next time I would highly suggest half  the mayo. For a little kick I added a few rip of Tabasco . 0verall the taste was good and everyone liked them.

Great classic recipe.  It was not soupy for me but I would use only 1/2 cup mayo even for up to 8-9 eggs without changing any of the other proportions.  I would substitute about 2 tablespoons or a little more of plain yogurt for some of the half a cup of mayo just to make it healthier. (I tried 1/2 cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of plain yogurt but it was way too tangy and 1 cup was way way way too much in quantity.)

this was the first time I made this recipe and I always follow the directions the first time. Next time I will cut the mayo by half, adding more only if needed, to help preserve the egg flavor.  The flavor was good but more mayo than egg.  I had a LOT of filling left over  which probably wouldn't have happened had I used less of the mayo.
