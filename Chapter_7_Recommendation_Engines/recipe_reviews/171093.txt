I submitted this recipe.  Allrecipes omitted my warning not to use this recipe on soft-fleshed fruits like strawberries or raspberries.  The wash will "burn" these fragile fruits.  Best if used on fruits that have a "skin" like apples and blueberries.

Gotta wash those veggies!  This was simple to make but the instructions don't say to shake it before you use it - the soda isn't dissolving completely.  Also, it does foam so I made it in a bowl, stirred, then put into the spray bottle.  It doesn't say to leave it on the counter or put it in the fridge - I put it in the fridge to be on the safe side.
