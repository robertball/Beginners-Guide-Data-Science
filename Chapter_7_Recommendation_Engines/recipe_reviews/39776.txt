This is the best flan i've ever had!  I couldn't find the chocolate flavor packets at the store so I used 1/3 cup of unsweetened baking chocolate instead.

Incredibly easy to prepare, this fancy flan really impresses.  I made one large flan for a party, instead of the individual flans, which also worked well, but I had to increase the bake time to about 80 minutes. (gas oven) Again, it's super easy to make and a definite crowd pleaser.

I love this recipe.  I have tried other chocolate flan recipes and they were definitely inferior.  I suggest using Mexcian vanilla in this flan.  I have also omitted the chocolate and it turns out just great.

This recipe has been in my family for years, I was surprised  to find it.   I make it a bit differently thou.  I don't use any chocolate or butter, and only 3 eggs.  I also use a meat loaf pan.  For flan glass don't work.  Every time there is a pot-luck people ask me to bring the flan.

We love flan and this is the best recipe I have found for it. This recipe sounded a lot harder than it actually was to make (it was very easy).  I follow the same recipe but sometimes omit the chocolate and it is still excellent.  Also, I use one baking dish instead of a muffin pan or ramekins.

I couldn't get this blended like I would have preferred. There were bits of cream cheese and butter that floated to the top (which becomes the bottom) and they gave a weird texture to the flan. It tasted good, but not my favorite flan recipe. Nice to have something different though.

I made this for my friends who found out they don't really like flan lol that would have helped. But, over-all, if you enjoy flan, this might be a change of pace from the norm.
