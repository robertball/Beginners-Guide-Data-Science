I have made this recipe twice now.  The first time it was awful...there was a taste in it that my husband and I just couldn't get past.  It was the white vinegar and the liquid smoke.  Next time I made it, I deleted those 2 ingredients and they turned out wonderful!  I guess you have to make them to suite your own personal taste.

This one of the best recipes I have ever tried, especially within a five minute notice.  I didn't add the veggies nor the liquid smoke and the parsely due to it's unavailablility but regardless, the recipe turned out to my satisfaction, but I'm giving it a 5-star rating because my three picky teenagers thought it was the best they had ever eaten, and actually thought that I had bought the sloppy joe mix in the store.  Imagine their wide eyes, and suddenly stopped chewing when I told them it was not from the store but from this website.  They all three simultaneously gave me the thumbs up symbol before they resumed eating!

I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOOD, BUT IF YOU HAVE TO BUY ALL THE INGRIDIENTS I THINK IT WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE. I THINK MY SLOPPY JOES(WITH ONION, KETCHUP, BBQ SAUCE AND A BIT OF BROWN SUGAR IS JUST AS GOOD..I HAVE EVEN BEEN OUT OF BROWN SUGAR AND USED WHITE SUGAR AND NOBODY KNEW THE DIFFERENCE). I THINK I WILL STICK WITH THE CHEAPER VERSION OF THE TWO.

I give anyone credit who spends the time trying to perfect a recipe. In our house sloppy joes are for the nights I need to make "quickie dinners" and truthfully, the canned stuff works just fine. This was, however, pretty good.

**3780 calories for the total recipe as written, (adding a 1/2 head of cabbage totals up to 3920)**

I have been using this recipe for the past 10 YEARS, it was the 1st recipe I printed off the internet! :) 
Two big changes I have made: 
~HALVE the vinegar and lemon juice. 
~Chop up an entire head of cabbage in the food processor (to small crumbs) and add it to the doubled recipe (just a half head for the recipe as written). It might look like too much but it's not, it blends perfectly with the texture of the groundbeef and my family can't tell the difference when I make it without the cabbage. Cabbage is super cheap (and healthy!) and is a great way to really stretch the meat in this dish without gumming it up with oatmeal like so many recipes call for.
This is a superb freezer meal--I make a double batch every couple months or whenever ground beef is on a great sale and bag it up in freezer bags. Quicker (and cheaper!) to just defrost a bag quickly than even opening a can and browning up the meat. My family gives this a two big thumbs up--with the caveat of the vinegar/lemon juice change ;)
(oh, and you can use the un-condensed version of the gumbo soup if you can't find it, I've done that often with no noticeable difference, it'll just need to simmer a bit longer to compensate for the additional liquid. Another frugal hint: Aldi's often carries the uncondensed version in their Fit & Active brand if you have one of their stores nearby)
Anyways, Thanks Mark, love the recipe!

This recipe is awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated however, didn't have any liquid smoke - no problem - I am not a big fan of it anyway.  But my kids devoured it.  I was so skeptical at first......but it was absolutely fantastic.  Didn't have time for a crock pot - simmered on the stove for 2 hrs. - PERFECTION!!

The texture of these is phenomenal. I think every ingredient is well worth the work. Jalapeno is an extra my husband and I added. We'll never go back to the "old" way of doin' em.

I made this over the weekend to feed the friends that were helping my daughter move. It was a big hit!!! Only thing I left out was the liquid smoke. I will make this again and again.

I got roped into making sloppy joes for the office, (seems I have the only stove in town).  Decided on this recipe because the ingredients felt right.  I did cut back on the vinegar and lemon juice, and they were wonderful.  It's definitly a keeper.  Thanks Mark

I used 3 pound beef and added chopped green onions, cooked in a crockpot.  This is the best sloppy joes I've ever tasted, my family loved it.

Loved this recipe, was expecting to be able to freeze at least half but these were gobbled down before I had a chance. Will be making these again. Would be great for a potluck. Thanks for the great recipe.

This recipe was very delicious & I'll be using it often. After mixing the ingredients, I simmered for 1/2 hour and served. I love the taste of fresh vegs. and all was consumed. This recipe is in my recipe box for future meals.

I didn't have condensed chicken gumbo soup so I used organic powdered condensed chicken soup, I also didn't have yellow mustard but used gluten free white mustard and lastly I didn't have white vinegar intead I used Mirin cooking wine. 
The dish was wonderful! Much better than I remember the best canned sauce mix.

We ate these, but none of use were too impressed with them.  The vinegar taste was very strong.  I guess we are used to a tomato-base sloppy joe.

I have looked for years for my sloppy joe recipe that used Chicken Gumbo Soup.  I was thrilled to find this one.  Substitute any other ingredient (of course, not the beef!)....but leave in the Chicken Gumbo Soup....it's the secret!

I loved the looks of this recipe and tried it last night.  I found it to be too vinagery for my taste.  I added another can of tomato paste to slightly thicken & tone it down, let it set in the fridge overnight, and had it for lunch today.  It was great.

The next time I make this, I wiil go with 3 lbs hamburger, (freeze for when I go ice fishing for an easy meal), and lighten up on the vinager and lemon juice.  Now to me, that will be the perfect sloppy joe!  Thanks for the recipe.

I put this together and everyone was commenting on the strange smoke flavoring scent (I think they were worried) but it was an overall hit with them and especially my kids.
Thanks again

Followed the recipe as written and it had an overwhelmingly vinegar taste. I tried adding another can of tomato paste at the suggestion of another reviewer and then tried adding brown sugar to counteract the vinegar to no avail.I will not make this recipe again.

THESE ARE THE BEST!!!!!  You definately have this one perfected!!!  It is worth the effort, and most of the ingredients are things that are always on hand!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe...I will never make sloppy joes from a packet or can again!

I made this recipe but  I didn't taste it.  I don't care for Sloppy Joe's but the family does. And they liked it. Based on the reviews I left out the liquid smoke and the vinegar. I added a 1/4 of a red bell pepper that I needed to use up. Since I'm not a fan of this dish I think I'll just continue to make it the easy way....out of a can.

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I don't even like sloppy joes but this recipe I love them!  I omited the vinegar and smoke flavoring.  Instead of regular mustard I use dijon mustard.  I also add a touch of cumin and a clove of garlic to mine.  They are so good and it makes a lot - sometimes i freeze some of it and then on nights i am too busy to cook I can just pull it out.

We thought this was just OK, but then we're not huge sloppy joe fans.  I thought it was a little too tangy.  I'll probably not make this again.

Given to me by my mother before 1950! She always used chicken gumbo soup for sloppy joes, but not so many ingredients.  Very good!!
