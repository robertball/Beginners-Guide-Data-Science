Would rate this a 10 if I could.  Browned breakfast sausage (from this site) with 1 lb hamburger.  Added onion, celery and red pepper.  Mixed in undrained can tomatoes and green chilies and drained and rinsed can red kidney beans. Mixed cooked noodles with the meat mixture.  Poured into greased baking dish.  Topped with shredded provel cheese and sharp cheddar.  Baked for 15 minutes.  Very versatile recipe.  Next time will melt Velveeta cheese on top.

I changed this recipe a little. I omitted the stewed tomatoes and added jar prego sauce. I also left out the kidney beans. I also added provolone and mild cheddar cheeses.

This casserole is EXCELLENT. I like to add extra cheddar cheese, mushrooms and chilies to give it some extra kick... my friends love it. Thanks from a (formerly) hungry college student.

I omitted the green pepper and pork and doubled the tomatoes to up the veggie quotient.  Very tasty!

I divided the recipe in two.  Substitutions: no ground pork, no beans, used a large jar of of chunky spaghetti sauce, sprinkled shredded Italian cheese mix and baked for only 20 minutes.  The family absolutely loved it and asked for it to be on the regular rotation! Good base recipe.

It just seemed that it was going to be too dry for my likings so I added a little flour to my meat/veggie mixture (to thicken) and then added a can of beef broth, making a gravy/sauce before adding the tomatoes, beans and a can of mushrooms.  Also added some mozzarella to the sauce and then seasoned to taste w/salt & pepper.  I did top w/parmesan & baked as directed. :)  Sorry.  Not really a review of the original recipe but thanks for the idea for a quick after work meal for my family.

It tasted ok but really felt like it needed something to bring it all together better.  In it's current form it's very dry and comes out really as just a loose collection of ingredients.  It feels like there was some fundamental ingredient omitted like a cream soup base.  Also confusing recipe in that only 1/2 cup of parmesan is listed in the ingredients list but then the recipe calls for use of 2 cups of cheese for the topping.

I liked it. I made some adjustments according to what I had on hand. I think next time I'll use mozzarella instead to tie things together. Everything was very separated. Needs a little Italian seasoning too.

Really great and highly flexible dish. A few changes I made was using black beans and Mexican seasoned tomatoes instead of stewed. I like a little spicer so added some cayenne and a few diced jalape√±os.

Love this recipe, but I made a couple of changes. The only meat I use is 1 pound of 93/7 ground turkey, I use veggie penne, and I usually do not bake it (it's too hot in Texas is run the oven if you can avoid it.)
