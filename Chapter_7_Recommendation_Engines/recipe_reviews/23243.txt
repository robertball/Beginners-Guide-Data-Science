Awesome!  I too tripled the amount of whipping cream for the sauce but don't triple the flour.  1 tbsp. should still be enough but add just a tiny bit at a time if it's not otherwise you'll end up having to thin it out with water like I did.  Also, a quick side note, if you use pre-cooked shrimp a way to keep them from getting rubbery is to just add them at the very end so they just warm instead of cook more.

Had a good flavor...we added more Parmesean and whipping cream...Not enough of a sauce for us.  Pretty good, though!

Yum, Yum, Yum...I thought this was a restaurant-quality recipe.  I did agree that it needed more sauce , though, and next time I will probably make more.

I changed the recipe a bit by adding sun-dried tomatoes instead of roma.  It made an incredible difference and made this already great recipe even better!!

Excellent recipe.  Will double the amount of sauce next time as I felt like I was eating pasta with just a side of the sauce.

Wow, this recipe is really special. It is my boyfriends absolute favorite recipe. He claims that it is better than anything he has ever had while eating out. I love how simple is is, and I love all the fresh tomatoes, especially how healthy they are. I always make more sauce than called for. I find that I can cut down on the butter to about half, and use part light cream and part 1% milk to cut on calories.

This is such a good recipe. I changed it a little.  I used a little bit of onion and subbed in some chopped green onion.  I took advice and used 3/4 or so cup of cream.  I used one of my big orange heirloom tomatoes and a nice red pepper.  I also used some of my purple basil.  It was so pretty with the red, orange, purple, green from my garden, and pink from the shrimp.  The only change I might add next time, which there definately will be a next time, I will add a little white wine for a little more complex flavor.  With the changes I made, this is a resteraunt quality meal!

Listen I made this last night and this recipe is GREAT try it even if you're not a good cook. I added a little extra salt, some crushed red peppers and used sundried tomatoes instead of roma tomatoes. I also doubled the whipping cream. My husband loved it and wants it again on friday :)

My husband & kids love this dish.  It's the only one I can make continously and not have him complain.  I add more heavy cream, garlic, and cheese to my dish. So yummy!

good creamy sauce for shrimp pasta.  I would have added mushrooms just to tweek it to my liking, but I was overruled by the rest of the house.

"This is really good" according to my husband. Delicious. I made more pasta because he doesn't like it too saucy. I'm going to try with chicken next time. A definite keeper.
