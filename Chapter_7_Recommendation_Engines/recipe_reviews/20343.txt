This recipe is awesome!  It's got the least ingredients of all the other pies I looked at, and it is SO easy to make.  I made it exact the first time, my family said it was "too sweet".  (As if there were such a thing...but they are not that into sweets & when they do have them, they tend to think they have more sweetness than other people.)  When I made it a second time, I cut the amount of sugar in half.  Still "too sweet" for some family.  I cut the sugar all the way down to 1/3 cup.  Just right for them.  AND, it still tastes sweet to those who DO eat sweets a lot & like the sweetness.  I also changed from regular peanut butter to "natural" peanut butter on the most recent pie...and I think that toned some of the sweet down also.  The *only* reason I changed the sugar amount originally was b/c of my family.  I love the original...and I like the less sugar versions I made also.

This is outstanding.  My family asks for it all the time.  A variation is: instead of peanut butter, use Nutella (a hazelnut-chocolate spread)  ooo boy

Heavenly! It is very smooth and creamy tasting. I make this according to the directions and I top mine with whip cream, chocolate and caramel syrup and crushed Reeses cups. You can also store this in the freezer. It won;t freeze solid, it just stays firm and cold and it is best eaten when it is firm and cold, I highly recommend trying it. I accidently discovered it and now I store mine in the freezer all the time.

This pie tastes impressive for very little work!  Taking other reviewer's advice, I used 1 cup pb, 8 oz cream cheese, and 1 cup regular sugar--SO GOOD!


UPDATE: for a really delicious twist, try adding slice bananas to this pie--I put them in the crust before adding the pb filling.

WOW!  that's all I can say really.  I used an oreo crust and I drizzled chocolate syrup individually on each slice and it turned out to be fantastic.  It was a little hard to mix the peanut butter, confectioner's sugar, and cream cheese together by hand, but boy was it worth it.  I don't hand out 5-star ratings frivolously, but this one really deserves it!  If I make it again I will experiment with different toppings.  Thanks for the recipe!

Made this pie for a pie auction and it was a hit!  Drizzled Hershey's chocolate syrup over the filling and crumbled Reese's candy bar on top.  Will definitely make again!

Only improvements I made to the recipe were to use real whipped cream (1 cup whipping cream plus 3 Tb powdered sugar, whipped until stiff) in place of the Cool Whip, which always imparts an artificial taste, and add 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. With the real cream, this was sublime! I topped with chocolate syrup and quartered peanut butter cups. Easy, but fabulous flavor!

WOW! This is wonderful! It isn't heavy like some PB pies are. It's very light and airy and doesn't make you feel overly full. I took advice from MySweetCreations and added chopped up Reese's and Chocolate Syrup. I picked up the 8oz CoolWhip and didn't realize until I was making it that I was short 4oz. It didn't matter, everything still turned out and it was gobbled up at Thanksgiving! I will be making this many more times. Thanks for the great recipe! :)

This was very easy and tasty!  I made for Easter and everyone loved it.  The only change I made was to add a little more peanut butter.

This was good, but very rich.  I used a store-bought chocolate oreo crust.  If you choose tho make this pie, make sure you have plenty of milk to go with it!

I made my own graham cracker crust, I put a chocolat pudding layer then added the p.b. mix (which I used 1 cup p.b., less 1 cup sugar, and a full 8oz cream cheese)  froze it for about 3 hrs then put in fridge for hour before dinner.  It was really good - very decedant and rich. next time would lighten up on p.b. to original 3/4 cup.  still very good.

One of our most favorite pies. I make this once a month--especially during that special time during the month.......like Tuesday. ;) You wanna make this really awesome? Today I used Nutter Butters in a homemade crust and drizzled the top with homemade hot fudge and chopped peanuts. It's AWESOME. For someone who dosen't like peanut butter, I LOVE this pie.

I guess I'm in the minority here but I didn't love  this pie.I thought I would have because I love everything in it but it was way too sweet. I realize that it's dessert and it's supposed to be sweet but it was really over the top. Even my six year old who could eat eat sugar by the spoonfuls didn't like it.  I think an 8oz block of cream cream instead of 3oz cream cheese might have made a difference. It may have cut the sweetness of it somewhat. Don't think I would make it again anyway.

I used all natural peanut butter increased to 1 1/4 cups, reduced sugar to 1/3 cup,and used 4 ozs of cream cheese.  Came out great!  It was very rich and not too sweet.  Thanks for the recipe.  Oh, and it was super easy to make too!

I used the extra smooth cool whip and then decorated the top with chopped up Reese's Cups and Special Dark Hershey's Syrup. This pie won me first place at out local festival's pie contest. They wouldn't even give me the prize until I gave them the recipe!

Wow!  This was a hit!  If I could, I would ding it just half a star because the amount of sugar is over the top. I used natural peanut butter (only ingredients = peanuts and a little salt) so I figured a cup of sugar wouldn't be too much, yet it was too sweet.  If you are using a PB with sugar or another sweetener listed in its ingredients, I highly suggest you add only 1/2 C sugar or maybe even less.  I chose this recipe over the others because it had less ingredients, but make sure you buy some mini PB cups to garnish with!  Super simple to whip up with the Kitchen Aid!

This pie was absolutely wonderful! This was the first dish I had ever brought over to my mother-in-law's house, and I was incredibly nervous since she has been a professional cook for 30 years. Imagine my relief when she ended up loving the pie! This was so easy to make, and everyone found it to be so yummy. I made the crust homemade with melted butter and crushes Chocolate Animal Crackers. For the top, I drizzled caramel and chocolate syrup and spread crushed Reese's Peanutbutter cups.

This is a great pie & very easy to make! I made 4 of these pies for several different families on Thanksgiving. I followed other's suggestions and used 8oz cream cheese and lined crust with bananas. I topped with whip cream, 2 reeses cups, marshmallows, caramel & nutella. Everyone who tried this loved it.

Super easy, very good, and VERY rich.  You can only eat a small piece, but it's a delicious small piece.  My only note is that I would put it in the freezer rather than the fridge so that you will get a firmer and less gelatinous pie.

Love it!  I used a regular graham cracker crust since I didn't have a chocolate one.  I melted chocolate chips and coated the bottom of the crust before filling it.  I also drizzled the top with semi sweet chocolate and topped it with fall colored sprinkles.  Wow!

This is the best pie ever!  Everyone I make it for goes crazy over it!  It's so easy.  The only thing I change is I put 1 cup of confectioners sugar instead of the 1 1/4.

Yummers....thought it set up and tasted better about day 2 and 3.  I did refrig. it several hours before serving but, it still was fairly soft---however, it didn't stop people from eating it.  Next time I"ll refrig. at least 1-2 days.  Really easy too!

Oh was this good!!!  I used 6 oz cream cheese instead of 3, I only used 1 cup or powdered sugar, and since I love PB, I used a cup.  Even my husband, who isn't a PB fan, loved it, but I could eat the whole thing myself!!!!!  Thanks for sharing - i will make this again and again.  It's so quick and easy!

If you are a peanut butter fan and are looking for an easy, foolproof recipe for a creamy peanut butter pie, this is it! I made the pie the night before, placed in the refrigerator and just prior to serving sliced, topped each serving with a swirl of homemade whipped cream and a miniature Reece's peanut butter cup. I was so hoping I would have at least one slice leftover :( Thanks for sharing your recipe, MickeyRenee! It is a solid 5 star recipe and a definite keeper for me!

Wonderful!  Smooth, creamy, and decadent.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used a regular graham cracker crust instead of chocolate out of personal preference. Made it for my family, but will definately make again for a party!

My husband (a SUGAR maniac) said it was too sweet.  But I'm giving it 5 stars anyway because I used my own homemade whipped topping AND added cut up frozen mini peanut butter cups on the top w/ chocolate syrup to make it pretty.  So the additions may have done it!  Will definately make again - just w/ less sugary add-ons!

Chocolate and peanut butter!  Yummy.  I made no changes with this one.  My oldest daughter gets the credit for helping and decorating.  I just made suggestions.  She used Butterfingers and Heath bars for the decorations. As for the rating, it was not my alone either.  They rated it too.

I've made this pie many times, and it's always a hit! I started using crushed Oreos  and chocolate sauce as the "crust," and topping with more chocolate sauce. It's so simple and easy to make, and so rich and delicious! I'll keep using this one for many years to come.

After reading reviews that it may be too sweet, I created my own recipe to help cut back on the sugar.  I used all natural pb with no sugar added.  I use heavy whipping cream that I whip until stiff and do not add sugar to it.  I then can taste the filling to see how much sugar needs to be added.  If you like the flavor of bp, do not add a lot.  If you like a sweeter pie, then add more.  Or just follow the original directions.

Took this to a pie party, and it was the first to disappear!  For the crust, I pulverized a box of chocolate graham crackers and mixed in melted butter.  Also went a bit heavy on the PB and slightly light on sugar...probably will cut back even further on the sugar next time.

I served this tonight to some friends, who all really liked it. I used an Oreo crust, natural (1 ingredient) peanut butter, lined the crust with sliced bananas, and drizzled melted milk chocolate over the top. Delicious, but very runny! I'll make this again, but store it in the freezer until use.

Delicious! I made 1/3 of the recipe and put it into individual dessert dishes with a graham cracker crust and whipped cream on top.  I didn't have chocolate graham crackers, so I used regular, but we all agreed it would be better with chocolate. Easy to make and very, very good!

I love this pie!  I used 1 cup peanut butter and only 1 cup powdered sugar since I don't like overly sweet desserts.  I topped mine with extra whipped topping and chocolate sauce.  Delicious.

So good, and SO rich!  Not necessarily a bad thing, but next time I may try to alter it just a tad.  But only a tad, and yes, there WILL be a next time!

This one just didn't turn the way expected. I made the day before serving and it didn't get very firm.

Yum!  Make with the oreo crust and low fat cream cheese & cool whip.  Then topped it with crumbled mini Reese's peanut butter cups.  Looked good and tasted even better!!

I was craving peanut butter pie so I made this.  I made it exactly as written and I didn't like it!  It was ok but next time I will make it with 8oz cream cheese and granulated sugar for a fluffier pie.  This was very rich!

I LOVE to make this pie! My boyfriend always requests it and it does NOT last! I always use low fat everything, and sometimes I use choc. milk. I top it with crushed up nutterbutters or butterfingers. Someday I'll try the non fat version!

This is heavenly... quite rich, but very good!   I, too, used crunchy peanut butter and I found it easier to mix the ingredients by stirring them one at a time into the whipped topping, although next time I'll mash up the cream cheese before stirring it in -- with both the cream cheese and the whipped topping being white, it was hard to tell if I got all the lumps of cream cheese mixed in. But a delicious and easy recipe!

This recipe is fabulous!  I made it exactly as directed, then added two chopped peanut butter cups for garnish.  I used generic whipped topping and it turned out great.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  Thanks!

So so good!! I made an Oreo crust. And I put 1 cup sugar, 1 cup peanut butter, and 8 oz of whipped cream in the pie. I would recommend reducing sugar to just one cup, but I would do everything else per recipe next time to make it less rich and "lighter" for everyone else. 
I dropped whipped cream on top using a spoon,cut up I think 3 or 4 Reese's cups and placed those in the gaps between the whipped cream,and drizzled melted dark chocolate and peanut butter on top. It looked  fantastic!

Omg, this pie is divine! I eyeballed the peanut butter and probably added more than 3/4 cup. I also decreased the confectioners' sugar to 3/4 cup, I think more than that would make it way sweeter than it needs to be. I followed others recommendations to use the entire 8oz block of cream cheese and an 8oz container of Cool Whip. I also mixed in maybe a cup of milk chocolate chips. MmmmmMmmmm, this recipe is a keeper!

This is a great and easy recipe.  Both times I've made it, it was the first dessert to be gone!  I just use a graham cracker crust, and I top with some chocolate syrup for decoration.

This pie was so simple to make and it was a huge hit for Father's Day. It looks decadent with the Reece's Peanut Butter Cups and chocolate syrup on top, and the taste is even better! So rich and creamy... this will definitely be my go-to dessert for get-togethers.

Absolutely decadent!  I used 1 C peanut butter and 1 C powdered sugar and realized I had only bought an 8oz container of coolwhip (sugar free!) but it worked out awesome!  Mde my own crust with chocolate teddy grahams and crumbled Reese Peanut Butter Eggs on top!  LOVED IT!  I am planning to slice the rest and freeze as singles!

Wow this was good, a wonderful pie from so few ingredients. I made as written and may try adding less sugar just for heath reasons: not for the flavor, I think with sugar, peanut butter and cream cheese it will be a rich pie no matter what. The texture was perfectly silky. I may try doctoring the pie itself up in the future (peanut butter cup pieces, fudge layer, lots of decoration on the top) but this will be the only filling I use, thanks very much for sharing :)

I could eat this whole pie! I used a full cup of a peanut butter and only 1 cup of confectioners sugar and drizzled a little hershey's chocolate syrup on top. After my first piece my mouth was watering for more. DH loved it too! Thanks Mickey - will be making again and again!

A very good recipe! I made it last year and have been asked to make it again this year. I have seen other "peanut butter pie" recipes since then, but this is still the best. Why? It's simply to make and the least expensive one. Thank you for sharing.

Yummy. Very easy to make. Used 1 cup peanut butter, 1 cup powdered sugar, kept other ingredients the same. Still sweet and rich. Store didn't have chocolate crust so used regular graham cracker crust. Drizzled with chocolate syrup.

Delicious! I used 1 tub (8 oz) toffuti cream cheese instead of regular cream cheese and I used reduced fat peanut butter. I topped it with chocolate chips, pieces of "Cookie Dough for Ice Cream (Eggless)" from this site and drizzled it with "chocolate glaze I" from this site. I served it frozen, straight from the freezer and it was delicious!

Use an electric mixer and make sure your cream cheese is room temperature. Very good and not as heavy as peanut butter cheesecake.

This was a great dessert!  I did only use half of the sugar that the recipe called for, because I was afraid that it would be too sweet.  I was glad that I made the choice to alter it.  I finished it off with crushed Reese's Cups on top.

Beyond delicious for peanut butter lovers and lovers of creamy desserts! Made in 9" springform pan with
a chocolate crust: 1 1/2 pkg. graham crackers, 1/2 C 10X sugar, 1/3 C unsweetened cocoa, and 1/3 C melted butter. Upped the peanut butter to approximately 1 1/4 C, doubled the cream cheese and 10X sugar respectively to 6 oz., and 2 1/2 C., combined with the 12 oz. Cool Whip. Plated beautifully as a quasi-torte.

This was great! I added more peanut butter and decorated the top with reese's and chocolate sauce. Oh, and my grocery store only had graham cracker crust, so I melted chocolate chips and smoothed it over the crust and hardened it in the fridge before filling.

This pie was a hit on thanksgiving day. It was not too sweet like alot of other peanut butter pie/cheesecake recipes. The only reason I rated this recipe 4 stars is because it said to use 3 ounces of cream cheese. I used 8 ounces because I did not think using 3 ounces would be enough to fill up the pie pan. Other than that this is a very good recipe, and I will make it again.

This pie is awesome.  I made a few minor changes for my (our) taste - used chunky PB. Made my own crust out of Oreo cookies (Oreo cookies with filling,  finely crushed in food processor, mix in very soft butter until it holds together and baked off and cooled) make my own real whip cream.  Topped with mini dark chocolate PB cups.   Family said it is the best PB pie they ever had.

I used another reviewer's adaptation of 8 oz. cream cheese, 1 c. powdered sugar, and 1 c. PB (only because I hated to have 5 oz. of cream cheese left over. Using the whole block was easier).
It was DELICIOUS, but only if you like PB as a dessert. Some of my family didn't care much for it for that reason, but two of us loved it.
I used whipped cream on top, since the filling didn't quite fill my graham cracker crust. The light whipped cream was the perfect compliment to the heavy filling.
Next time I will use my mixer to mix the filling. I was not able to blend it smoothly with just a whisk.

been making this for years! The family loves it especially my peanut butter/chocolate loving husband.
I just went ahead and added the whole 6 oz block of cream cheese.  
trick is to actually give it time to setup in the fridge...good luck with that (but it really does make a difference- so try to resist for just a couple hours)

I used this recipe as a guideline. I made homemade Oreo crust,  cut the sugar back and used real whipped cream.  With these changes the pie was great, but very rich!  A little piece is enough to satisfy, I will make again.

So good. So easy. Very few ingredients. The first time I made it we also made homemade lemon meringue, pumpkin and apple. All homemade crust and all. Guess which one was the most popular. Yup, this easy peanut butter one. I like to garnish with crushed up snickers bars (my favorite over Reese's peanut butter) and then I melt peanut butter and drizzle it. Then I melt a few chocolate chips and drizzle. Looks pretty even though it's store bought crust and super easy. Thank you!!!

Delicious! I reduced powdered sugar to about 3/4 c., used natural peanut butter, and topped with a layer of fresh whipped cream and a drizzle of hot fudge topping before refrigerating.  I didn't have a prepared pie crust so I made it in a quick & easy homemade Oreo crust - 24 crushed Oreos + 1/4 c. melted butter.  My whole family & our friends loved it!

This was really good. I did pay attention to the other reviews and cut the powdered sugar down to only 1/3 c. Next time I may even go down to 1/4 cup because it was still plenty sweet and we like to watch our sugar these days. Also, I made the mistake of chilling it in the fridge (i've never made a pie like this before). Next time I'll put it in the freezer. ;)

This was a winner, with minor changes.  Used 1 cup natural peanut butter, 3/4 cup sugar, 6 oz cream cheese, 8 oz of cool whip.  It wasn't overly sweet or heavy to us.  Drizzled crushed peanut butter cup and chocolate over the top along with dollups of whipped cream.  Will make this again.

Made as written- but used less cool-whip. Stopped at 9 oz because it was getting fluffy. Used the graham cracker crust II from here also.

I used more cream cheese than the recommended 3 ozs it called for. Five ounces was definitely the sweet spot. Cream cheese is one of my favorite things to use.The organic peanut butter i used- Trader Joes was creamy but it was too liquidy so I used a little whipping cream to help it out a little. I then I added the Cool Whip and everything came out just the right texture. I then drenched the top with caramel sauce and decorated it with whipped cream and chocolate chips. The premade Oreo crust, I used was disappointing. It was the only chocolate cookie crust in the store.  I think a chocolate chip cookie crust would have gone a whole lot better. Will have to try that next time. Overall, a huge success!

Yum yum and yum! I went with a shortbread crust rather than a crumb crust just out of personal preference and I doubled the filling because I was using a deep dish pie pan. This is just soooo good!

This pie is amazing!  It is by far one of the best pies I have ever had.  It is very rich and I wish I could figure out how to make a lighter version so I could enjoy it without the guilt.

Very good, but very rich. Only a small piece needed. Made it with 8 oz cream cheese, 1 cup peanut butter, and 8 oz Cool Whip. Topped it off with chocolate chips.

This pie was surprisingly easy to make and has a scrumptious decadent peanut butter flavor. My husband adores it. The only change I made was hand-whipping Bird's Dream Topping instead of using Cool Whip as you cannot get Cool Whip in UK grocery stores.  I would make this pie again and again.  This recipe will become a dessert staple.

I used 8 oz cream cheese as recommended by other users. The cream cheese flavor is prominent, so keep that in mind if you choose to use 8 oz. I added sugar to taste; I used about 3/4 cup. I whipped my own cream (I don't care for Cool Whip). I whipped extra and used that to top the pie. I crushed peanut butter cups for the bottom of the pie and chopped more for the top. I threw it in the freezer for a quick set. It was pretty darn good. Using fresh home made whipped cream really put it over the top. I'll make this again, but plan on tweaking it to make it even better.

This is okay, but the ingredient amounts seemed "off". It was too cloyingly sweet. The second time I made it, I increased the cream cheese (I actually used Neufchatel to cut down on the fat and calories without sacrificing taste) to 8 ounces and increased the peanut butter to 1 cup. This fixed it! Delicious and the perfect blend of sweet and tasty. To put this over the top, I used crushed nutter butter cookies for the crust and OMGosh, too scrumptious for words!

I have made this recipe more times than I can count.  The reason is because once I bring it somewhere I am always asked to bring it again!  This pie is so easy to make and SO delicious!!  I think the recipe is fantastic as is, but I do cut the sugar to 3/4 cup just for my families taste.  I also reserve some of the whipped topping to put on top and then drizzle some chocolate sauce on top.  It looks great!!  I store it in the freezer and take it out about 30 minutes prior to cutting.

3oz of cream cheese has to be a mis-print!  I used 8oz and it was perfect-  great consistency and flavor- super easy to make.  I drizzeled hot fudge in the bottom of the pie crust before filling with the peanut butter mix and then drizzeled hot fudge on top- amazing!

Wow this was great, it was so peanut buttery and thick, I will never buy a frozen peanut butter pie again, the only modification I made was I did about 8oz cream cheese to make the pie thicker. This is a quick keeper dessert.

This is so good and so easy to make (10 min), as long as you have a couple hours for it to set in the fridge. It's a crowd pleaser...really how many people don't love chocolate and peanut butter?

Yum yum. Pie is a tad rich but that didnt stop me eating my piece and more. The only change I made was making my own whip cream. (2 pint carton of whipping cream and about 3 or 4 tablespoons of powdered sugar whipped together)

Fab!  Made this for a friend, and their family rated it in the top 3 desserts they've ever had.  (A 2nd only to "Better than Sex Cake".  
I used a full cup of PB, a cup of powdered sugar, and the rest the same.  I halved mini Resee cups and placed them face up around the crust edges and spelled "Thank you" in Hershey's syrup in the middle.
A BIG HIT!!

Wonderful!  Made 2 of these today...one I made as written, but crumbled homemade chocolate covered peanut butter eggs on top for garnish.  The second one I added 1/2 c hazelnut liqueur to make it an adult treat. Because of the extra liquid, I added about 1/2 c extra peanut butter, and maybe 1/2 c more powdered sugar.  Both were scrumptious!

This recipe was great.  I melted some Reese's pb chips and spread over the shell.  The end result was yummy.  Really sweet, so I could only eat a little piece.  Great with some whipped topping and a big 'ol glass of milk.  Thanks! :)
