I loved this. As others said, cut way down on the butter, use equal amounts of mustard and honey so it's not so sweet. Cover breasts in sauce then dredge in bread crumbs. Yum - comes out moist with some crisp on the outside--eliminates the basting too. So easy!

I made a few revisions but this was fantastic and GREAT as leftovers.  The butter should definitely be cut in at least half, and I added a generous portion of curry powder which made it absolutely spectacular.  I also used O'Charley's brand honey mustard instead of mixing my own honey and mustard.  I baked chicken legs and boneless pork chops in a 9x13 with this poured over it and served with rice and steamed carrots.  It was absolutely delicious.

Great Easy Meal!  I love that the ingredients are all things that I keep stocked in the pantry.  I only needed 2 chicken breasts so I cut the sauce in half and there was still a lot.  I'm not good about basting once the meat goes into the oven.  With a 3 year old, I want to "set it and forget it", so my sauce didn't glaze very well.  I still gave 5 stars because that was my own problem.  Next time, I will only pour half the sauce over the meat, and put the rest in a sauce pan, to thicken.  Then pour the sauce over the meat at the end.

I served this with fresh green beans and squash-apple bake.  A great Fall meal.

Fast, easy and delicious!  You can't ask for more.  Next time, I'll try this with pork chops.  Should be great!

We really liked this chicken dinner!  I wanted to make six chicken breasts, so following the recommendations of others, I adjusted the recipe as follows:  1/4 cup butter; 1 cup honey; 1/2 cup mustard and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  It did make a lot of the sauce, but that was fine. (It worked out well for the six chicken breasts, and we like a lot of sauce!) Served it with rice and green beans.  The sauce also tasted good on the rice. I baked it at 375 for 45 minutes; worked out well for the six chicken breasts. I only basted once, and probably didn't even need to do that.  I will definitedly make this again.

This was really good.  I used less than 1/4 cup of butter, added garlic powder, & cayenne powder to the mustard mix.  I slathered two good sized chicken breast pieces in the sauce and then coated them in breadcrumbs.  I baked for close to an hour and it turned out moist and delicious with a good balance of flavors.  This was quick & easy.  I will definitely make again.

The only reason I gave this a 4 instead of a 5 is because it way too much butter.  If you at least cut the butter in half and add some cayenne to kick it up a little, it is wonderful.  I was in a hurry so I made it on the stovetop and it turned out just fine.  My husband and I really liked this and will add to the regular rotation.  Thanks for this super easy and delicious recipe!

I made this with thighs. It turned out well, but I cut the butter waaaay down - one tablespoon of butter and one tablespoon of olive oil was more than enough. I also added some cayenne and a little bit of powdered ancho chili for flavour.

This was delicious. I used lemon pepper, Emeril's Essense and garlic salt. We dripped the broth over rice. I will definitely make this again.

I don't really like babying my chicken while it's in the oven, so I took the advice of another reviewer and simply dredged the chicken breasts in the sauce and then rolled it in crushed butter crackers to bake it. The result was a moist chicken breast with lots of flavor and a crispy coating. My husband loved it! I also reduced the butter to about a tablespoon, with great results.

This is great!  I used the leftovers the next day in a quesadilla.  I just added goat cheese and dipped it in some apricot jam.  Uh-mazing!

This was a very easy and delicious dish.  I only used 2 Tablespoons of butter but otherwise made as written.  The chicken was moist, tender and the sauce was excellent.  No basting was required as the chicken fit into a 9x13 pan all touching with the sauce poured over the top.  I had extra large chicken brests so butterflied them to make thinner pieces.  Hubby rated in his Top 10!

This sauce is amazing. I used honey mustard dressing instead because it is what we had, added some red pepper, dredged the chicken in crushed Ritz crackers before baking for crispy-ness and had no leftovers.

I'm giving this 5 stars for the finished outcome with some slight modifications; I took others advice and cut back the butter by half and I doubled the mustard.  Before baking I salt and peppered each piece of chicken.  I also stopped baking at 30 minutes then placed the pan under the broiler for 5 minutes.  This helped carmalize the sauce a bit and gave a bit more color.  I spooned the extra sauce on top when I served it and it was wonderful!  Thinking I may try all under the broiler next time.  Served with saffron rice and veggies!

I found this recipe when looking for something new to serve friends for dinner.   I read a lot of the recommendations people made, and came up with these modifications.  I use equal parts of everything.  When I make 6 breasts, I use 1 cup honey, 1 cup dijon mustard, 1 stick of melted butter, and 1 tsp. pepper.  This recipe comes out great every time, and is super easy.  Thanks for the recipe.

I've made this chicken several times now -- it's great for a quick and tasty weeknight meal.  I omit the butter completely (trust me, you won't even miss it) and just mix equal parts honey and dijon mustard with a healthy dose of black pepper.  I brown the chicken breasts on the stove in a smidgen of olive oil before putting them into a baking dish.  Then I slather them with the honey mustard and bake them for about a half an hour.  Good with wild rice and steamed veggies.  Also works well sliced up and laid on top of a salad.  Either way, save a little honey mustard to drizzle over the top of the meat just before serving.  YUM.

This was great. I reduced the butter by at least half and added a couple T's of curry powder. I also ran out of honey so I used Agave Nectar which was just fine. I also used a tenderizer hammer and flattened the chicken breasts quite a bit, and after coating in the sauce, I coated it in bread crumbs. I saved a bit of the sauce and drizzled it on top when it was done. Good stuff.

No repeats on this one, but not bad.  If I were a honey mustard lover, I'd like it more.  Chose to do 1/4c mayo & no butter.  The sauce was already pretty thin so I thought the mayo would still provide the moistness & thicken it a little, too.  I did 1/3c honey, 1/3c dijon, 1/4c mayo & 1/8t cayenne pepper.  It was good - still a little too sweet, but you could taste the cayenne.  BUT!  :D  Tip of sprinkling plain breadcrumbs over it so it would stick was a GREAT TIP!  Remember that one!

My family loved this dinner.  I made exactly according to the recipe, which I like to do the 1st time I try one.  Next time, I'll use 1/2 as much butter, even though we are butter LOVERS, because it was greasy and unnecessary.  The flavor was AWESOME and it was an easy dish!  As leftovers the next day, the grease hardened at the top of the dish, I scraped it off and after reheating, the flavor was fantastic (again) w/out butter, so it really was not adding much.  My family said its a "do again dinner" and so simple!

Very delicious and easy. I like to mallet thin the breasts first, tenderizes them and keeps them more submerged in the sauce as they cook!

This recipe is D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S!!! The chicken is full of flavor and this is coming from someone who never uses honey-mustard. I followed the recipe with the exception of butter- I did not use any. I don't know what it tastes like with butter, but it is perfect without. 

I lined the pan with foil so no mess! I also sprinkled an herb rub on top and marinaded for 4 hours. 

The only problem I ran into was the dryness. I covered with foil throughout the cooking time, yet it was very tough. However, the flavor is divine and I will definitely be making this again, and again...and again! Only next time, I will check it at 30 minutes instead of 45.

I absolutely loved this chicken!  I did use yellow mustard instead of dijon because that's what I had on hand. Added a bit of cayenne. Didn't use butter, just a little olive oil. Only made 2 chicken breasts in an 8x8 pan, but made all the sauce.  So there was plenty of it.

For something different, I used thighs. Changes....I used a 1/4 cup honey and a little less than a 1/4 cup of butter. Added 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and black pepper. Baked in the oven for nearly a hour. DH loooves this recipe!

I made it using the suggestions made by others, 1/4 cup butter, 1 cup honey, 1/2 cup mustard. It was easy, delicious, and there is enough sauce to pour over rice! I also made 7 small chicken breasts instead of 4 regular sized.

OMG... I really liked this recipe.  I used coarse ground dijon mustard.  I also cut down on the butter.  Be sure to baste it as the recipe calls for.  I will make extra sauce next time so that I can drizzle it on rice and serve along with the chicken.  This one will be in my regular rotation.  So quick and easy and you can eyeball the ingredients.  THANK YOU!

This one is a keeper, and so easy. But I do use less butter than the recipe calls for and it is not missed.

I made this for my parents last night.  I couldn't use pepper due to food sensitivities, but substituted garlic powder and it worked great!  I also made the honey/mustard equal portions as suggested by others here.

I did flour and sear the breasts in a pan with butter before putting them in the dish to cook - it browned them up a little and really helped the sweet mustard sauce "hold on" to them during cooking.

Parents declared that this recipe is "a keeper!" and continued to ask what I did to make the meat so very tender (other than the pan searing, just followed the recipe!).

I think it would be very nice over a rice or herb buttered pasta.  Going to try the pasta next time and see...

I thought is was ok, although I agree with some of the other reviews that it is over rated.  My husband hated it and my little ones would barely touch it.  Unfortunately, I won't be making this again even if I did doctor it up.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Such a great taste for just a few ingredients! I cooked the chicken in the crockpot rather than in the oven and it turned out perfectly.

Very easy to make and tasty, especially with Grey Pupon mustard.  This is a new staple in my house.  I use chicken tenderloin strips and bake them for only 20 minutes.  I recommend using a small enough baking pan so that the sauce covers the chicken as much as possible.  This heats up well for leftovers, too.

Love this recipe.. make it about every other week. Very simple.. I don't modify much but since I am watching my diet these days I do the following:

Cut down the butter... Maybe 1/4 cup AT MAX. I use the same amount of mustard and honey (1/4 cup as well). I use 3 chkn breasts, cut up in strips, and throw everything in a baking dish. I use a smaller baking dish so that the chicken is almost covered by the sauce.. that way it cooks in the juice/sauce vs the "basting frequently"... and viola!

Sooo yummy! It's a family favourite. Cut back the butter is the only critic....as if it needed to be said again! Hahaha. This sauce is excellent if made on it's own for a dipping sauce for chicken nuggets. A full five stars from me, even if it calls for too much butter. No biggie, just adjust.

To make it healthier, I omitted the butter all together.  I eyeballed the other ingredients, dipped the chicken, then dipped it in panko crumbs.  I drizzled the remaining sauce over the chicken.  No need to baste with the crumbs.  I also used 8 chicken breast halves.  So easy, tender, and tasty!

Easy to make and has great flavor.  The chicken was tender and very juicy.  Like others, I cut the amount of butter to 2 TBSP.  I made a little extra sauce to pour over a side of white rice.

Delicious, I am licking my fingers as I type. I used half the butter and because I didn't have enough Dijon mustard, I used what I could of Dijon and Honey and for the rest I added sweet honey Dijon mustard. Amazing! Husband loved it too, so you know I will make it again.

Very nice- even though I made significant changes.  I did not have honey in the house, so I used apricot jam instead.  This worked wonderfully, and produced a great flavor.  I want to try this in the future with pork.

I cut out the butter and it was great. Easy delish chicken. I also like to fix and forget it in the oven so I coated the chicken in the honey-mustard and coated it in crushed corn flakes. Which basically changes the recipe so I feel that I can not honestly review the dish as it deserves

I used this recipe on chicken thighs.  I did make one change, because thighs not as lean as breasts.  I omitted the butter entirely and used 1 TBS canola oil to make the sauce a little thinner.  The chicken was very flavorful without being overwhelming and I enjoyed it.  I will try it with breasts and butter, next time.  This is a keeper.

This was yummy and oh so easy to make. I only had regular mustard so I used that. I also added some red potatoes to the mix, which was a really good use for the extra sauce.

I added chicken seasoning, and cracker crumbs. I also used a lot less butter. Turned out lovely! This is going to become a regular meal for us! I also made it with ham instead of chicken and broiled it at the end for about 5mins. It made a nice glaze, tasted really good!

This recipe was good...mostly because it was tasty and easy. It wasn't anything spectacular but I appreciate the fact that it was so easy! I took the advice of some of the reviewers and only used about 1/2 the amount of butter, added corn starch, a few bread crumbs and a bit of garlic powder. We also ate it with rice (w/chicken stock for flavour), and I poured some sauce over the rice which was a mistake on my part. It was too sweet and the chicken and rice would have been good on its own.

My fiance and I thought this chicken was good.  I would take other reviewers advice and cut the butter in half next time.  I made just two chicken breasts (they were large), but halved the mixture and still thought it had to much butter. I also baked mine for about 35 minutes instead of the 45 it calls for.  Oh, make sure you baste often as the directions say.  It makes the sauce glaze the meat.

FANTASTIC!  I followed what others said & used only 1/4 c. of melted butter.  I made this in an 8x8 glass dish with 4 small chicken breasts & the sauce stayed put & was absolutely delicious!

very easy to prepare, although could but back on the butter.  i dipped chicken in the sauce and coated w/ italian seasoned japanese panko bread crumbs & baked as directed.  it was absolutely delicious, tender, & flavorful!  the bread crumbs add flavor & trap in the chicken juices + sauce.  didn't have to baste during baking or marinate beforehand.

I cut the butter in half as suggested by other reviewers. It tasted good, but the sauce seemed thin. Next time I think I would add a little cornstarch to get it to thicken and glaze better.

I  cut the boneless, skinless breasts into large strips. After reading reviews did the following:  Used equal amounts of honey and plain mustard(didn't have dijon on hand) and used no butter at all. I then coated with italian bread crumbs and baked till largest strip was not showing any pink.  It was fabulous and whole family loved it. Quick and easy.

Wow - this is so good!  We gobbled it down.  I used 1/4 c. butter instead and will use less next time, as I don't think it needs that much.  Also, I used Whey Low brown sugar sub instead of honey, as I am cutting back on sugar.  It was so yummy.

I thought it was great and so did my husband and young children.  It was sweet and very tastey.  I did change the amount of butter like other reviews suggested. I used 1/4 cup instead.  Otherwise I didn't change a thing.  I had no problem remembering to baste it and didn't find that a draw back at all.  We will be adding it to our favorites and our regular rotation for sure.  I loved that it was a boneless, skinless, baked chicken recipe with so few ingredients.  I served it with the "Easy Rice Pilaf" recipe on this site and steamed carrots. So easy and so yummy, perfect for those busy week nights!

This was delicious and so easy. Husband loved it. I used chicken tenderloins as that's all I had an just baked for a shorter amount of time. Used less butter and added more pepper. Excited to have a new, easy chicken recipe for busy weeknights! Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  My breasts were pretty thin so mine only needed about 25-30 minutes in the oven.  I cut thin slits crosswise down the chicken to get the sauce flavor into the chicken better.  We loved it, thanks!

I enjoyed this recipe.  The chicken was extremely moist and juicy.  It had good flavor, but I wish the sauce would have thickened up a little bit more so that some of it would have stuck to the chicken.  Overall, it was a good recipe though.

cooked this last night.  I only used about 1/8 cup (I was running low) and 1/8 c dijon mustard.  Only used 1/4 c butter, as other reviews stated.  I marinated in the fridge for about 4 hours and then pan-fried it on the stove with butter-flavor spray in the pan.  The chicken turned out so yummy, it was not dry in the least and the flavor was great, not too heavy on the mustard OR the honey.

Our family of 5 LOVED this chicken recipe!  I've never written a review before but had to comment on this delicious dish. Made the recipe as is but used half grainy Dijon and half spicy/honey Dijon. I also added a bit of cayenne pepper for a little "kick".  I used a combo of boneless breasts and thighs. My family wants this chicken again next week!!

This is an excellent recipe! I did as one viewer suggested and coated the chicken with bread crumbs after dipping it in the honey mustard mixture.  The chicken was very tender.  I will definitely make this again!

We really enjoyed this chicken! Hubby and son gave it two thumbs up. I also used equal parts of a stone ground dijon mustard and honey and added a pinch of garlic powder. I also only used a couple TBsp. of butter as suggested. The chicken came out really moist. Will definitely make this again.

It was absolutely delicious...only I added 2 teaspoons of mayo to my "marinade" to help it coat the chicken better and I also cut the butter. With Au Gratin potatoes and string beans....this meal was a great treat.

This is a good family friendly recipe.  I used chicken tenders and baked at 350 for about 30 minutes.  Mixed same amount honey and dijon, 1/4 cup butter and pepper to taste.  Dipped tenders in mixture then rolled in breadcrumbs.  Very good!  Thanks for the recipe.

Used other suggestions and cut the butter in half.  Cooked at 350 covered for 30mins and uncovered 45mins basting every 15-20mins.  YUMMMMMMMMMY!!!  My picky kids and hubby destroyed it.

After reading other reviews, I made the following changes.  I used 1/4 cup honey, used Honey Dijon mustard and use 1/4 cup melted butter.  I also sprinkled Italian Panko breadcrums over the chicken.  This was a very flavorful dish, which I will make again.

My family loved this - so five stars, but I did have some adjustments. As other mentioned, 1/2 c. butter is way too much.  I used 1/4 c. and I think I will use even less next time (it is so flavorful without the extra fat - who needs it)?  I also added a tsp of curry powder and it rounded out the dish perfectly.  For baking - it came out super moist by baking at 375 degrees for 30 minutes with foil over, then basting and baking an additional 5 minutes without foil.  Then basted one last time and put under a hot broiler for about 2 minutes.  This gave it a great golden top. (I use a convection oven - so less time was needed than the 45 min mentioned in recipe). It really is a great fall recipe!!

Great recipe. Another big hit.  The only reason it wasn't a 5 for me is because  the chicken itself (beyond the taste of the sauce) needed something IMO... maybe a slight sprinkling of salt?  Not sure, but if you prefer your meat to be well seasoned, you may need to modify the recipe to suit your own taste buds.  It's a fabulous recipe as is though.  Thanks for sharing.

My family really likes this recipe.  I cut the butter to 5-6 Tbsp.  The key is to bake it in a shallow (9x13) pan.  Once when I used a smaller pan, the chicken just sat in the butter. When baked in a shallow pan, the sauce almost looks like it burns or becomes crisp and dark after it cooks for a little while.  That's when I start basting it.  There's not a lot of sauce left over.  The sauce becomes a glaze, if you keep basting it.

This is by far the BEST recipe I have tried so far.. The flavor was incredible.. I followed the recipe exactly! My husband and I loved the flavor of the sauce, no single ingredient was overwhelming in the flavor, it was just right!

This recipe received mixed reviews from both family and friends. While everyone agreed that it was ok, not everyone agreed that they would want it agin. I did decrease the butter as others suggested and lightly seasoned the chicken before adding the sauce, otherwise, I followed the directions exactly. I agree there was too much sauce, the chicken swam in it and basting was not required. Listening to what the complaints seemed to be, I will try it one more time making about 3/4 of the sauce recipe or increasing the amount of the chicken AND cut back half on the amount of honey mustard so it won't be quite as an overwhelming/strong mustard flavor.

This was pretty good! I needed a quick fix so I sauteed thin chicken breasts, then added honey, dijion mustard, and a little corn starch for thinkness. In a matter of minutes a had a delightful meal.

YUM! Our family enjoyed this. I didn't add pepper, I let everyone put their own amount on after. I broiled the chicken at the very end of the cooking time and it put a real nice brown coating on, it was DELICIOUS!

I halved the butter as others did. Also, I made one piece of chicken without breading (as the recipe dictates) and the sauce just ran all over the pan and did not really penetrate to flavor the chicken much. I coated the other pieces of chicken with the sauce and then rolled them in bread crumbs. This locked the flavor in and turned out wonderfully. My husband loved it!

Worth every review, I read the reviews first so I knew to cut back on the butter, wasn't quite sure how to do the basting but still turned out good, even if a little dry. I had it with a side of broccoli and the sauce tasted excellent on it. Try experimenting with different spices and herbs to really get the most out of this recipe.

So quick and easy which makes it a favorite already! I did as others suggested and cut the butter in half, I too added a little cayenne and garlic powder. Oh didn't have the Dijon (not a big fan of it) so I used what I had which was spicy brown mustard and this was delish! Four thumbs up at my house which includes a picky 14 year old. Thanks for a new way to eat chicken for us!

While I seem to be in the minority here, this didn't do much for me. I thought it was just ok, but my family was even more lukewarm. Made it as written, chicken was moist enough, but just nothing special. Might be ok in a pinch since the ingredients are often on hand, but I probably won't make this again.

YUMMY! I used 1/4 cup salted butter, 3 tbs dijon mustard, 3/4 cup honey. I put alittle (1 tsp) veg oil on the bottem of a warm shallow glass dish, baked it @ 400 for 30 min turning every 10 min. My kids loved it. I served it with yello/green bean carrot mix and 6 cheese tortalini from m&m's. That was good. I put alittle bit of the juice over the chicken and veg mix. MMMmmm Thank u.

This is a great easy recipe!  I misunderstood other reviews with regard to coating the chicken with breadcrumbs.  I used drumsticks (skin removed) , rolled them in bread crumbs THEN poured most of the sauce over the chicken.  (Other reviewers sauced the chicken then coated in breadcrumbs.)  I basted once.  I'm sure it's good with the breadcrumb coating ether way.  I was pleased with my mistake!  Took other's suggestions and reduced butter.  I used 2T butter.  Lined baking dish with parchment paper for easy clean up.  Great over rice!

Very good! Per other reviewers I cut butter in half, down to 2 T. I think next time, I'll use only 1 T. Recipe makes lots of sauce, I made rice (used some sauce for the rice) and sauteed fresh veg.

Simple and easy recipe. I took the advice of others and: 1) dipped chicken in mustard sauce then dredged in Italian style bread crumbs; 2) used 1/4 c. butter, 1/2 c. mustard, 1/2 c. honey. Used this up to coat chicken, so I made another batch to pour over chicken.

Excellent!  Took others suggestion and made the ratio of honey/mustard equal.  Also cut the butter in half.  And added garlic powder, onion powder, extra ground black pepper, and seasoned salt.  Increased heat in the last 5 minutes to thicken the sauce and brown the tops.

I followed others suggestions and mixed 1/4 cup each of Gray Poupon mustard and honey and melted buttler. I dipped the chicken in the mix and rolled in bread crumbs before baking.  Then I made another batch of sauce on the stove and dribbled it across thee chicken and rice just before serving.  Everyone loved it!

YUMMY!!!  as many others mentioned, i cut the butter in half and i used almost equal parts honey and mustard- i went a little heavier on mustard because i didn't want it too sweet.  i also just used plain old yellow mustard because that's all i had on hand.  i also used chicken tenders instead of breasts, packed tightly together.  it was sooo moist and tender.  this went in my recipe box and i will be making this again and again!

What a perfect, easy, delicious recipe that the whole family will absolutely LOVE!!  I feed six very different taste buds and this was totally a hit for everyone!!  Totally agree on the equal amounts of mustard and honey and half the butter.  I did not have bread crumbs to coat after I dipped the chicken in the mustard sauce, so I used corn meal and it was outstanding and very moist!  A definite favorite hit!!

The chicken came out really good. I used regular mustard and reduced everything to 1/4 a cup and it was very tangy, but my family loved it. I think next time I will use a little more honey. The sause also tastes great on pork chops.

Followed the advice to lower amount of butter and honey. I used 1/4 C of each ingredient. Left out the pepper but added it to bread crumbs along with garlic and onion powder. Since I used a bread crumb coating, I didn't need to baste. My 13 yr. old son is the pickiest eater in the world and doesn't normally eat chicken but he ate a whole chicken breast!

nice change for chicken - I used a mallett to thin the chicken and seared the breasts - added mushrooms - sauce was a little too sweet - next time I will decrease the honey by half - overall a good dinner -served with baked herbed baby red potatoes, fresh green beans with bacon and crusty bread. I will make again

I absolutely loved this!  I was lazy and used French's Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce instead of making my own, hence the 4 stars.  Very moist and tasty chicken, can't wait to make it again!

This dish is very sweet. I'm kind of confused as to why it's getting such great reviews when everyone is commenting about how they tweaked the recipe. I used 1/4 cup of butter and i would half the honey as well. It's too sweet. My husband and i both didn't like it. :(

This was so good and very easy. I reserved some of the sauce while the chicken was baking and used it to saute some onions. I also added curry that was suggested on another review. I put everything on top of some cooked brown rice. My family liked it so much I had to make it again the next evening.

Our family of 10 all loved this recipe.  We made it tonight and only cut the butter in half.  We all wanted seconds, the flavor was great, the chicken was moist.  We served over rice and had fresh green beans with bacon.  Nothing could be finer. This is only the second time I ever reviewed a recipe because they are usually just so so.

Family enjoyed this recipe. I made it exactly as stated and the sauce was very good! I only wish the chicken had absorbed more of the flavor, as without drowning in sauce, the chicken was a bit plain. Even better leftover.

I usually love honey mustard and same with my kids but didn't really enjoy this.  The flavor just off a little and not really sure why.  Wasn't horrible but just will not make it again.

Simple and delicious!  I made it with the full amount of butter required, and it's perfectly tasty that way. I did, however, halve the recipe and add garlic powder and chili flakes. Gave it a nice extra bit of zing!  The chicken is tender and the sauce is delicious. I'm putting this in my regular dinner rotation.

This recipe was fantastic! I also used a store brand honey mustard to save time and then coated it in crushed saltines as I did not have breadcrumbs. It was a hit! My 7 year old hates mustard and still loved this recipe!

This recipe was easy to make and the chicken was moist, but a little bland. Its a good recipe but not fantastic, I'll try another one next time.  Like others, I used half the amount of butter.

This recipe is so incredibly easy! I made 4 chicken tenderloins... I used 1/4 cup of spicy mustard, 1/4 cup of honey, 1/8 teaspoon of pepper, and 2 tbs of butter. I put all the ingredients in a microwavable bowl and melted everything together and stirred. Then I coated all the chicken with the honey mustard sauce then with italian breadcrumbs. Finally, I baked it for 25 mins. This recipe is easy and fast! Thanks!!

Delicious!  I used half honey and half brown sugar (didn't have enough honey) and half the butter.  Will definitely be making this again - I'd like to try it with all honey.  We didn't think it was too sweet as written.

I followed the suggestions of making the butter, honey and mustard in equal amounts - however I should have made the amount only 1/4 cup.  I had a lot of sauce left over.  It was delicious with white rice and green beans.

I took the advice of another reviewer and dredged the chicken in bread crumbs after dipping in the sauce.  The breasts were moist, delicious and easy to make.

This recipe was Soooooo GOOD! Very quick and easy. I followed other suggestions and did equal parts butter, dijon mustard and honey (1/4 cup each).  I also seasoned the chicken with an all-purpose seasoning.  The chicken was very moist and the honey mustard was perfect, not too sweet or tangy.  This recipe is a definite keeper, my son asked me when are we having it again and I just made it last night. You will not be disappointed with this recipe if you like honey mustard.

Good- Jon just thought it was OK. I kept 1/2 the sauce back, simmered it on the stove and served it on top of the chicken. Served with wild rice.

I followed the advice of other reviewers and coated the chicken breasts in the honey mustard buttery liquid and then dredged them in bread crumbs!  Absolutely wonderful idea!  I even followed another reviewers menu suggestion and served them with green beans and rice.  I loved this recipe.  Nice, easy and yummy dinner!  Will make again!

I'm on a diet and my 10 year old is in charge of cooking on Monday night.  This was so simple and easy.  We used 1/2 of the honey and substituted 2T of lite margarine for the butter.  It was PERFECT and easy enough for a kid to make with only minimum supervision.  This one is a keeper!

I too have been making this for years, but as a BBQ chicken burger.  I pound the chicken breast a bit thinner, marinate them in the honey/mustard, and grill them on the BBQ, basting with the sauce as I go. I also add a last basting (with a fresh mixture of honey and mustard) after they are cooked and we eat them on toasted buns with coleslaw on the side. I will be trying them this way now too.

I have been making this same recipe for years, got it from a friend in college.  I use a little curry powder instead of pepper.  I also cover it while baking to keep the sauce thinner.  I cook egg noodles and add them to the pan before serving.  Yummy!  My hubby's favorite.

4 stars because this doesn't need a half stick of butter - I only used 2T. Otherwise, a great quick meal for weeknight meals! Next time I will try the breadcrumb suggestion.

simple,quick- I dipped in sauce and in bread crumbs for husband and son- for me (low carb) I just left plain and basted during cooking- I used sugar free honey (sold at the wally world, tastes like real deal!) and ballpark mustard (outta dijon)- didn't cut butter, seemed fine for us- chicken was very tender- husband said he would not eat again soon- said it was good but not his favorite thing- son thought it was awesome- they like honey mustard more for dipping though- thanks

Excellent! I also changed the recipe to equal parts honey and mustard, with only a small pat of butter. I dredged the chicken breasts in the sauce and then coated in a mix of plain bread crumbs, parsley and crushed french fried onions and baked at 350 till done...great!

The only reason I am giving this a 4 instead of a 5 is because I don't care for it the way it is written.  The first time I made this as the recipe is posted and found it to be way too sweet for our liking.  I made the following adjustments:  1/4 cup melted butter, 1/4 cup dijon, 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and the taste was out of this world and the best part of all, I can actually remember how much of everything without having to look it up everytime I make it!!  This has got to be one of the easiest recipes on the site and can be adjusted to suit your own personal taste (s).  This is one recipe I will be making for years to come!

This fits the bill for an easy weeknight meal.  An added plus that my very picky 6 year old asked for thirds!  I used 2 table spoons of olive oil instead of butter, and added poultry seasoning.  Served with rice and green beans, very easy!

An easy, rewarding recipe. The results are similar to what you'd expect looking at the ingredient - there's no big kick-in-the-mouth flavor, but rather a pleasant, sweet, and mild flavor. Both the mustard and the honey come through clearly. As others have noted, I used a few modifications: -I used less butter. -I added a little bit of salt and ground garlic to the honey, Dijon, and butter mix. -After dipping the chicken in the sauce, I then rolled the chicken in unseasoned breadcrumbs. -I flipped the chicken once midway through baking. -Since I used breadcrumbs, I do not baste the chicken, but I did pour a little more honey on each piece a few minutes before the chicken was done cooking. This isn't gourmet, but it doesn't try to be either.  It's simple, easy, and good.

I decided to try this recipe because of its positive ratings. The ratings are false positives because unless you really doctor this recipe, you will be unhappy with the results. Almost every reviewer had their own twist, giving this recipe a false high rating. Preparing word for word...this in itself is disgusting. The chicken was way too sweet and my husband wouldn't even try it. When I tried it, I couldn't even eat it. I was more mad at the fact that I had to throw away chicken. I wasn't satisfied with this recipe at all and unless you doctor this heavily, you won't either.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. After 45 minutes with no basting the chicken was tender and flavorful and moist. I will definitely make this again as it is so easy and the few ingredients required are ones I always have on hand.

This was a winner for even my picky husband. Take all the tips to heart -- bake for only 35 minutes, add bread crumbs, use half the butter and add some extra spices to the chicken and/or sauce. Will definitely make again and share recipe with friends.

With all these glowing reviews, I'm sad to say this wasn't a home run for us.  I went back to be sure I didn't mess up the recipe, and I definitely did not.  Hmmmmmmm.  If you decide to make this, I will say there's way too much sauce and it's very thin and runny.  If I were to try it again, I'd cut the butter in half because I think it would make the sauce thicker (and reduce the calories and fat) and I might add garlic and a little more of the mustard.  It needs a little something more for me.   Sorry!

Thank you, thank you!  I was starting to think I was a really really bad cook.  My last 4 new recipes were horrible.  This was one of the best chicken recipes we've ever had.  Perfect.  We used about half the butter and basted about every 15 minutes.  Took just minutes to put together.  Definitely a keeper!

My family enjoyed this receipe.  I cooked the chicken for only thirty mins.  It was moist and perfectly cooked through.  I added some garlic powder.  I think next time, I will also add hot sauce to balance the sweet.  However, very tasty!

wish i could give it 4.5 stars. This smelled good in the oven, and my hubby especially liked it. I followed some of the other reviews and used about equal parts of mustard and honey, and just a little butter. i topped the chicken with a few mushrooms, green onion and strips of bell pepper when almost done. i wish i had taken a pic, it was pretty and tasty, too!

I saw some reviews that made this a couple of different ways. so when I made it I tried it two different ways on two pieces of chicken. I made the mustard sauce as written (butter or no butter it was pretty good!) and then one piece of chicken I dipped in the mixture and placed in the pan, the other I dipped in the mixture, sprinkled with a tiny bit of curry and dredged in panko bread crumbs before putting it in the pan. While they were cooking, I continuously basted the first one and every so often drizzled the other one with a fork dipped in the sauce. When they came out, I liked the bread crumb one infinitely better. The crumbs hold the flavor of the sauce and add a crunch. although next time, to avoid sogginess I would avoid drizzling with more sauce. The first one was simply too bland. Much of the sauce ran off into the dish even though I basted it, and even though you got a little flavor it wasn't much. Over all, I thought the flavors and everything was ok but not outstanding, so I did not keep the recipe for my personal collection. Others may really like it so it might be worth a try, but I would definitely recommend the bread crumbs.

This was delicious and we were starving so I didn't get a picture of it. I took a few reviewers' advice and used equal parts dijon mustard and honey. I love dijon and didn't want it to be too sweet. I also added a tsp of each garlic powder and cayenne pepper for extra kick and cut butter in half. I served with spinach salad and brown rice pilaf. Will definitely make again!

It's great as is. I used chicken thighs instead of breasts, maybe that's why I didn't have a problem with the sweetness, as others have mentioned. I spooned the liquid over the meat every 10 min. By the end of the cooking time, I had a thick glaze.

Followed this recipe as is but followed recommendations on decreasing the amount of butter. I used 2 tbsp of butter and it turned out great! My family loved it! Can't wait to make it for when company comes over.

I prepared this recipe exactly as stated.  I agree it was too much butter, but my chicken turned out very dry.  I put it in a 375 degree oven for 45 minutes, uncovered and basted it several times.

Giving three starts because my 3 year old loved it. I thought the proportions of the sauce were off. I only used 1/4 cup of butter like some reviewers did, and I thought there was too much honey. Maybe the butter I left out would have cut the sweetness? I'm not sure, but I think a 50/50 split of honey and mustard might  be best. 1/2 cup of honey was too much for me. With that said, I did eat it. Will try again with modifications.

Very good!  My husband does not like honey mustard but he even liked this chicken.  Serve with rice and you can put some of the honey mustard dressing on the rice for extra flavor.

My husband is a very fussy eater, but he does like chicken.  So, when I saw this I thought I'd give it a try and he loved it!!!  I changed a couple things. Very minor - I used cayenne instead of black pepper and I thought I was out of Dijon mustard so tossed in a Dijon mustard mayo I had and then discovered I had replenished the reg. Dijon mustard.  I didn't measure anything.  I thought I'd give the old "that looks about right" measurements and it turned out wonderful and will definitely try again (prob. be just a bit diff. again).

So quick and easy! I was able to mix the sauce in a couple of minutes and go for a walk while my son took care of the basting. Finished up with some steamed spinach when I returned for an easy week night dinner. The boneless breasts were dry in the middle, so next time I'll tenderize first or use bone in chicken breasts.

This was very delicious. I used 1/2 cup of honey, 1/3 cup of Dijon mustard, 1/4 tspn pepper, 1 tspn garlic powder, and then dipped the breasts in the honey mustard and then into bread crumbs. Very good. Next time I think I'll let the breasts marinate in the honey mustard for a bit before I dip them in bread crumbs. I enjoyed the sweetness. This is going into my recipe box. :-)

Tasty recipe!  My husband said it seemed sweet, but he liked it anyway.  I didn't quite follow the recipe, since I discovered I was almost out of dijon, so I mixed honey mustard with what I had and then reduced the honey a bit.  I followed some of the other suggestions about dredging in bread crumbs to eliminate the basting need.  I will definitely serve this one again.

I made this last week with very high hopes.  Had the sauce not been so sweet, I would probably have given it 4 stars because the chicken itself was very tasty (smelled wonderful while baking), but just wasn't crazy about the sauce. I even used equal parts honey & dijon as many reviews suggested.  I do love the simplicity of this recipe and the fact that these are typically "on hand" ingredients.  If I make it again, I'll cut the honey even further....more like 1 part honey to 2 parts dijon.

This is my favorite recipe! It is easy and delicious! I served it with veggies and Jasmin rice. It was SO good the four year old even appreciated it! Don't change thing, I followed the recipe to the TEE. The only thing I did was turn the oven on BROIL the last few moments to brown up the tops a bit. MMM!

So moist and tender and perfectly sweet.  I think next time I'll adjust the sauce a little to make more of a sticky glaze.

This chicken was a good, easy recipe to make for the end of a busy weekend. One thing that I really liked about this recipe is that it calls for ingredients that I always have on hand so there really isn't much planning involved with making it. I think to make this chicken a little healthier next time I won't add as much butter, and it would probablyy end up tasting just about the same. To make this even easier, this could probably be adapted to using the crockpot - just put everything together in the morning, and heat on low for a few hours. Thanks for the recipe, I know we will be making again soon!

This was SOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOOOOD!!!! I had 6 chicken breasts and used EQUAL parts honey, mustard and butter.  Before pouring the sauce over the chicken, I brushed on some of the sauce and then coated the chicken with EQUAL parts seasoned bread crumbs and grated parmesan cheese, just to give it a little bit of crunch and texture.  Came out GREAT!!!  All THREE of my kids RAVED about it, had seconds and practically licked their plates clean!!  Thanks for sharing this easy and YUMMY recipe!!  It's a keeper!!

This recipe was VERY GOOD! This was the first time my family had tasted something with dijon mustard in it and it REALLY suprised us! I scaled back some of the ingredients like some of the other reviewers said too. I used 1/4 cup of honey instead of a 1/2 and 1-2 Tbsp. of butter intead of a 1/2 also. Oh and I added just a pinch of garlic powder. We will definitely be having this again, next time I think I'll serve over rice. Can't wait!

Well, mine didn't turn out anything like the picture.  And I hate it when people rate something five stars, but changed the recipe completely and added more ingredients.  It'd be nice to read a review to a recipe exactly as written.   As for me, it wasn't bad, but it didn't turn out how I'd hoped.  My chicken was a little chewy and I had hoped the sauce would thicken up a bit more as I basted the chicken and give it some type of glaze.  Maybe with some tweaking this could be an excellent recipe, but as written it was just ok.

My whole family adored this recipe!  We used real honey from the honey farm.  I also breaded the chicken before cooking.  It added a nice texture, and help to keep the moisture sealed in.  When cutting into my chicken at dinner, my chicken sprayed it was so moist and yummy!  I def recommend chicken lovers to try this one!

This was okay but lacked flavor.  I followed the suggestion of others and cut the butter by half.  I then rolled the coated chicken in Panko breadcrumbs and baked it to an internal temperature of 180.  I've had much, much more flavorful chicken.

This was so good and very easy to make!!  I did use equal parts of dijon mustard and honey (1/4 cup each) and reduced the butter to 1/4 cup.  The chicken breasts I used were very little and thin and took less time to cook.  Yummy!!!!

This was awesome, but I did take other reviewers advice and only used 1/4 cup of butter for the sauce. I'm going to try the sauce on pork next time. I also added some garlic powder for a little extra flavor. Very tasty recipe!!

My husband really liked this and it was so easy to prepare.  I cut the recipe in half and used a tblsp. less of the butter.  I also increased the amount of mustard by a tsp. or so.

Used equal parts honey and dijon.  Try using Panko breading for this.  We did and it was fantastic.  Dipped in sauce and then rolled in Italian flavored Panko.  Turned the sauce into a reduction and then drizzled over the chicken before serving.  Outstanding!

I love this dish because it tastes great, and it is easy to prepare.  I added a little white wine to the mix.  Also, I've used Agave syrup instead of honey.  Those of you watching your sugars will love this option.   My family loves this meal prepared with either method!  When I make it again, I'm planning to add a piece of Swiss cheese just at the end of the baking time and melt it under the broiler.  Enjoy!

Pretty good!  We took the advice of other reviewers and cut the butter in half.  We also used equal parts honey and Dijon, choosing an amount intermediate to those described in the original recipe.  After dipping the chicken in the sauce, we coated in bread crumbs and baked.  We reduced the sauce down and used it for dipping - wonderful!  Unfortunately the sauce separated, but it was still a great addition (we though the chicken alone didn't quite have enough flavor).  We were impressed by how moist the chicken was.  Next time we will try basting (without breading) as the original recipe suggests.

My husband liked this so much, I had to make the exact same meal 2 days later with the leftover chicken. I did use 1/4 cup butter and played around with the honey/mustard ratio. I also put in some garlic powder and curry powder. I'm thinking this will be made often!!

I have to say, this is the first recipe that I HAD to review. It was amazingly good. I cook for 2 men (my boyfriend and our roommate) and they both LOVED this. My boyfriend asked me to make this part of our regulars. The only thing I think I changed was I had used slightly less honey but it wasn't much. I basted every 10 mins for a total of 4 times and it was perfect. I also did use 1/2 cup of butter, it thinned the sauce making it easier to baste and make the perfect coat on the breasts. I will definitely make this again and again.

Thank you, dfries for a wonderful recipe!  I wanted something different to do with my chix, and this hit the spot!  VERY tasty.  Served with Basmati Rice Medley --- used the sauce to drizzle on the medley. Husband raved.  Glad you gave this to us! (I did cut the butter, but that was for me --- everything else just as recipe stated.)

This was excellent and we'll definitely add it to our list of regular meals.  Like others, I cut the amount of butter in half, also added some garlic salt, and topped with bread crumbs.   Sooooo good and very easy.  My husband loved it but wanted a bit more of a bite--next time might try to mix in a little spicy brown mustard.  This one's a keeper!

This was an excellent recipe!  I followed the directions exactly and everyone loved it!  I did turn the chicken over several times while baking so the flavors could get to all the chicken.  Next time after cooking, I will thicken the sauce and serve with rice.

Had this tonight - absolutely delicious! Cut the butter a bit, but you need some in order to be able to baste. Sooooo easy! I took the advice of others and dipped the chicken in the sauce, then in bread crumbs, pouring the rest of the sauce over the top. Made 1 1/2 times the sauce recipe. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

The basic recipe was great, but did cut down on the butter. Other ingredients were doubled to pour over a whole No, 13 chook and done in the slow cooker. Great dinner with rice and green veggies. My partner couldn't get enough.

WOW! this recipe is amazing! i took the advice of others and cut the butter down by half. i also drenched the chicken in the sauce and then rolled it in bread crumbs. next time i wont do that because it was too messy to begin with and the breading came off too easy because it didn't stick while backing. besides that the taste is SPOT on!! i don't use measuring cups or spoons so i just eyeballed to what i thought was the correct measurements. i also made extra sauce to pour over the top when it was done baking. soooo yummy! i loved it.

This is an easy go to recipe.  I make this in the winter when it is just too cold to grill chicken.  I usually serve this with rice and green beans.  The mustard to honey ratio is perfect.  Nice and easy recipe.

Simple but amazingly flavorful! I adjusted the proportions so that I used 1/4 cup more mustard than honey, which made this recipe tangy-sweet and scrumptious. Fast to make and exceptionally delicious.

This recipe was sweet and simple.  I added some carrots and slices of potatoes to the mix.  The carrots add another sweetness to the already sweet sauce.  Fantastic with a bottle of white wine.

I love this recipe for the simple fact that it can be made without going out and buying a fortune's worth of ingredients that will otherwise never be used. And, it's good.  The flavor is similar to a Chinese restaurant's honey chicken, but without the soy sauce.  I made the recipe as written but with half the butter (as a result, it needed a bit more salt).  The chicken had a significant honey flavor but the mustard was barely detectable, which made for a good balance.  The recipe for some might be a little bland, so adding some herbs might be a good idea.  Anyway, this recipe is a keeper.

This was excellent! I made it as an impromptu dinner the other night for my in-law (very picky eaters) and they loved it! Even my Chef brother-in-law approved. One thing I will try diffrently next time is, at the end of the baking, I'll take the sauce and boil it down to make a  thicker sauce. As it was it was wonderful over rice!

My entire family loved this recipe!!  The only change I made was taking another users suggestion and dipping the chicken in the sause and then rolling in breadcrumps. I then took the balance ofthe sauce and poured it around the chicken and baked.  Good recipe to make for company.

I was really pleased with the way this turned out. Although I must advise that if you don't like it sweet you may not be happy with the taste. I added garlic, salt and only 1 tablespoon of butter. I like to keep butter to a minimum and 1/2 cup just seemed way too much for a healthy body. The chicken browned up and the sauce was wonderfully sticky, sweet and tangy. I put the chicken in a little foil boat as recommended by someone else and this worked a treat. I served it on a bed of sweet potato with some brocollini on the side. Might add some rice if I do it again. Husband loved it daughter stuck her nose up but then she does that with most of what comes out of my kitchen. Smiles from Australia!

I personally didn't like this recipe, my husband thought it wasn't too bad.  I felt that the mustard mixture tasted weird.  The only thing I changed is to cut down on the butter and changed the serving for 2 instead of 4.  I don't think I will be making this recipe again.

I followed others' advice and flattened the chicken slightly, dipped it in the sauce, rolled the cutlets into "Kievs" and breaded them in seasoned breadcrumbs.  Put the rolled, breaded breasts in the oven for 45 minutes as directed, and served the remaining honey-mustard sauce on the side.  The family loved it.  It was sooo tender and flavorful!  I'm definitely keeping this recipe, and using this altered method of prep for many other future recipes as well.

This recipe was amazing. I had to make 6 chicken breasts instead of the specified 4. I was going to increase the ingredients and added an 1/8 c extra mustard, but I didn't have any extra honey, so I only added the called for 1/2 c. It turned out perfect. Everyone enjoyed it and there were no leftovers.

Wow! This recipe was great. I did follow others' suggestions and decreased the butter and honey to just 1/4 c each and left the mustard at 1/4 c. I will definitely make this again!

Yummy! I used 1/4c of honey and 1/4 steak sauce and turned the heat up to 425 for about 45 mins. (I'm paranoid about undercooked chicken) and it came out very god. The whole family enjoyed it.

Very good. I made it as written. The only thing I did was to turn the chicken over after 1/2 hour. The chicken was very moist and flavorful. Will definetly make again. It's a keeper.

My family enjoyed this recipe. Chicken was moist and modestly flavored tangy and sweet to the palate.  I added 1/8 tsp coriander and 1/8 tsp paprika. I also marinated the chicken for 1 - 1 1/2 hours before baking.  I'll make this dish again! I served with wild rice and green salad.

I have made recipes similar to this but like other reviews, it lacked something for me.  I add a good dose of curry to it to liven it up - great combo with the honey - didn't even use the butter.  Just sprayed the baking dish so it wouldn't stick -

The taste was delicious and the chicken was moist and tender. The best part is that it was a very quick and easy weeknight meal. I added (1) chopped garlic clove to the mixture and sea salt and fresh ground pepper to the chicken breasts before baking. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was yummy!  I took the advice of the other reviewers & only used 1 tbsp of butter & reduced the cooking time to 35 minutes. I also added a bag of petite frozen Brussels sprouts.  They tasted great in the sauce.

Loved this recipe! I made it on the stovetop. Cut way down on the butter. Sauteed some mushrooms and made the sauce separate. Added curry like someone suggested. This was great!

Very easy, great taste, and the chicken stayed very moist.  I used a spicy brown mustard instead and thought it was good.  I also used two 5 chicken breasts without altering the directions and had plenty of of the mustard/honey mixture.  I will do this one again.

This is good, but I only gave it four stars because it was a bit overcooked at 45 minutes. I used two big chicken breast halves and put it in a 9 x 9 baking dish. The sauce did glaze a bit, but I think that I will take the advise of others and use less butter and then cook maybe 35 minutes. Pretty good overall.

This was very good. Very similar to Aussie chicken. Sweet and tangy too. Great flavor and the sauce complimented the chicken. I'd make this again.

Easy, good, did not require so many ingredients that I had to make an extra trip to the store.  I just altered the recipe slightly by adding a few more spices like garlic and curry.  Tasty and the whole family enjoyed this dish.

This was delicious!  I used chicken breasts for me and my husband and legs for my kids.  We all liked it.
My husband and I thought it may be nice made as chicken medallions, then served with the sauce over rice.  Also, if we are cooking for just the adults, we may add some hot pepper flakes as well.  
When I shared this with a friend, she said it would be good with salmon as well.

Bland. Even upon the advice of breading the chicken and addinng garlic I still found this to be very ho-hum.

This recipe was delicious. i usually dont like to make the same recipe twice but i've already made this one four times. Everyone loves it when I make it and my mother in law keeps asking for the recipe. make sure you cook it at least 45 minutes, I sometimes leave it in a bit longer. my husband loves to eat this with tagliatelle. YUM!

I thought the flavor of this sauce was wonderful!  I was really expecting more of a "glaze" to cook on the chicken, but it all stayed really runny.  So after baking it the required time, I put it on broil for several minutes on each side to try and get the sauce to be a glaze on the chicken. It worked, just a bit too much trouble!  Thanks!

Yummy.. I made a few changes however. Used less butter (and lite!), dipped the chicken in the sauce and coated with breadcrumbs. I cooked it for about 42 minutes, and it was good! Juicy and yummy. I served it with basmati rice.

It was good, but definitely needed more sauce. I left out 1/2 the butter and would add 1/2 more honey and dijon mustard next time.. But it was good.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I have made it twice and my husband raved.  We eat a lot of chicken so I am always looking for a different recipe.  I served this with a citrus and spinach salad, steamed whole green beans, and rice.  The sauce cooks down to a nice thick consistency which is very good over the rice.

VERY quick and easy, and very tasty. Needed something quick and easy after working all day, then going home and harvesting veggies from the garden, and this fit the bill.  Didn't really like the idea of all that butter, so I used 1/4 cup Smart Balance, and it came out great. Next time I will probably add garlic for some more taste. Served with Garlic Roasted Potatoes with Greens from this site (without the greeens) and fresh-picked zucchini from the garden!  Thanks for a great week-night keeper!

This was a great meal to make quickly! I used 1 lb of turkey breast, cut into tenderloins. I also cut down the sauce half and only used 2 tbl. of low-fat margarine; could use more pepper. I poured off 3/4 of the liquid in the pan about half way through to allow the turkey to brown and the sauce to carmelize on the meat. Right before serving, I used some of the leftover sauce and drizzled it over the turkey. Will try again with chicken and maybe the curry powder like another reviewer mentioned. Yummers!

Excellent Recipe. Perfect with Rice and a green veg. Double the mustard that it calls for, and keep everything else the same. Add a pinch of garlic salt and a splash of dry white wine. No matter how you cook it, the chicken comes out fork tender....great dish.

I used half the amount of butter that the recipe suggested and I still could have used a lot less. It just made the sauce more runny so it didn't really stick to the chicken well. It had great flavor but the sauce just had way too much butter.

Easy to do with ingredients you'll find in your kitchen...what's not to love?

Only had Yellow mustard and Agave Nectar.
Used Olive oil, no butter. Seasoned with salt pepper first and rub in olive oil, browned top in skillet. Mixed Agave, mustard, cayenne pepper  and onion salt and a little more Olive oil.  Put chicken in and covered with that mixture. Put in baking pan and poured the remaining mixture in pan also covered with foil.Baked on 375 for 25mins and broiled 8mins for crispy glaze. Everyone LOVED IT! A great go to for now on!
oh and I season to taste but used more agave then  mustard and tasted the mix before I added the chicken.

Excellent.  I poured the excess sauce over already-cooked rice and it was excellent.  Next time I will try dredging in crackers for a crispy chicken crust.

I will make the glaze thicker, it tasted great but I think would have been better if it was a little thicker....  My whole family liked it, including a few drop by guests....

Very easy and quick to make.  I did follow the suggestions of others regarding using less butter and using equal parts of honey and mustard.  It turned out really good.  I did not have a baster on hand so with a pair of tongs I would turn the chicken breast covering them all over with the sauce.  This is an important step because it creates a thin golden layer on the outside that makes the chicken look so much better.  I will make more sauce the next time because with the chicken flavor and simmering for an hour in the oven it makes a delicious sauce to cover the whole chicken and rice, I just found myself wanting more of it.

This was delish!!! I did add some salt and garlic powder to the sauce and only used 1/4 cup of butter plus a tablespoon of olive oil. We also used chicken fingers to make it more kid friendly. 

Once the chicken was finished cooking, I pulled it out of the oven dish, spooned a little sauce over it, and used the leftover sauce to toss some veggies in it and baked them. 

Served  the chicken fingers with homemade cheddar mash potatoes, and the glazed veggies. It was a complete hit! Super delicious, super fast and reheats perfectly for leftovers later on. It's now part of our dinner rotation :)

My family loves this recipe, I used the 1/4 cup butter as suggested.  I also use regular yellow mustard, because that is all I ever have onhand.  After I dip the chicken breast in the honey mustard mixture, I bread it with Panko crumbs.  Bake it for an hour and its always taste great.

This tasted delicious! I used chicken tenders instead of breasts so it would cook faster. They were done in about 30 minutes. I also used 1/2 cup of butter but next time I will probably use even less. I coated each tender and then lightly breaded them.

This is an excellent chicken dish.  As per other reviews I cut the butter in half, but other wise kept this the same.  A simple, delicious recipe that I make all the time.  Thanks!

This was closer to 4.5 stars...the toddlers didn't like the dijon so that was the only bummer. I took another reviewers advice and dredged the chicken in the marinade, then in panko. Then cooked it for 45 min. Moist and yummy. Boiled the rest of the sauce to serve on top. Will probably try without the panko next time.

Very easy recipe using ingredients I keep in my pantry.  I did follow some of the reviewer's advice and cut the butter to 1/4 cup (or 1/2 a stick).  I used 6 chicken breast tenders and baked for 30 minutes, basting twice during that time.  I also poured some of the remaining sauce over the chicken when I served it.  A hit with the hubby and two young boys.  Thanks.

I melted the butter but then forgot to add it; I  didn't miss it.  I used equal parts mustard and honey and finished by coating in herbed seasoned bread crumbs so that I didn't need to baste.  Yum.

This was great!  I didn't have Dijon mustard on hand and just used regular (will try Dijon next time).  I added yellow onion and fresh garlic to the sauce.  I also added a couple tablespoons of olive oil in place of the butter.  I might cut back a little on the honey next time so it's slightly tangier.  Otherwise, loved it!

I made this last night.  It was pretty good.  I took the suggestion of cutting way down on the butter and using equal parts of honey and mustard. Even my husband liked it, and he's not a big chicken fan.

I made a few changes to the recipe after reading other reviews. They were - used 1/4 cup butter,  spicy brown mustard, dredged in canned plain bread crumbs and baked for close to an hour. They were awesome!

This was yummy. I didn't have chickenbreast, the men in my house are darkmeatlovers, so I cut a whole chicken in half. I also used only a bit of olive oil instead of butter since I left the skin on the chicken. Toward the end i sprinkled some breadcrumbs and baked a little longer. Everyone loved it. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Simple, easy, and delicious!  Even my roommate (who hates mustard) loved it!  I served it with rice and made a little extra sauce to serve over it.  All around great dish

I mixed thin sliced chicken cutlets in the sauce mixture, then breaded in panko and fried.  This was quick and delicious!

I just cooked this tonight. Wow! It was hard to believe so much flavor with such little prepartion. I followed the recipe exactly as it should be done the first go around, then I will change anything to our taste if it is needed next time.  Well let me tell ya, nothing had to be changed! This recipe is great as it is written. I would not change one thing. Anything that can make my husbands head turn to me and say, "This is really good, hon", is a keeper.  Thank you, dfries for posting it for us!

Yummy! I cut the butter, honey, and dijon mustard to 1/4 cup for 4 breasts but I still had a ton left over so I will cut that in half again next time! I also added cayenne pepper and garlic powder (just couple sprinkles) and then topped with breadcrumbs with the last basting. It is flavorful and moist!

Very good recipe.  My husband loved it.  The only thing I'm going to explore a little more is to make the honey mustard sauce a little thicker.  It was a little runny with all the juices coming out of the chicken.  So I'm definately going to keep this recipe around and tweek it a little.  Thank you!

I liked this!  I made the honey mustard and reserved about 3/4 of it.  With the remaining 1/4, I dipped the chicken in it and then in breadcrumbs and fried it in the skillet. I then poured the saved sauce on top of the chicken before serving.  This was a nice change to the normal old chicken.

This chick was so easy and super good with a few variations.  Use equal amounts of honey and mustard (if you like it less sweet use even a little less honey) and cut the butter in 1/2 or even 1/4.  We peeled and thickly sliced potatoes with a little olive oil salt and pepper in a seperate baking dish and shared the oven space...simple quick dinner:)

This was a great dish. I cut the recipe in half since it is just my husband and I. He was disappointed there wasn't more. I followed other reviews and cut the butter in half. The chicken was moist and had a wonderful flavor. I think using all of the butter would have taken away from the other flavors. I will be making this dish again very soon.

This was SO GOOD. I used skinless thighs, used plain mustard instead of Dijon, reduced the butter to a couple of tablespoons, and sprinked fresh seasoned bread crumbs over the chicken after pouring on the honey mustard sauce. This is a keeper!

I never give any recipes 5 stars but this one takes the cake!  I didn't change the amounts but right at the end I put some bread crumbs on just one side- added just a little more juice over the top and broiled it.   Came out AMAZING.   I will agree with the others though...it is A LOT of butter and there was so much more mix left over.  this recipe was for like 10 chicken breasts!  I still wouldn't change it though.  it tasted too good.  And I wasn't even going to eat it because I was feeling sick.  Glad I did, thank you!

I did as many previous reviewers suggested and coated the chicken breasts in equal parts of honey and spicy mustard, then dipped the chicken in bread crumbs.  I should have repeated this process a few times to make the honey mustard flavor stand out a bit more.  I could barely taste it.  Next time, I'll also try marinating it a bit and see how that works out.  The chicken was very moist.  We liked it very much - thanks!

Lovely, I left the skin on when cooking but will remove it the next time as the chicken certainly is moist enough without it.  The flavor is wonderful not too sweet, and finger licking good.  My husband loved it.

I'm sorry.  This did not turn out the way I would have hoped.  The picture shows dark sauce.  My sauce was the color of dijon and the chicken was dry.  Maybe I did something wrong.  Would not make again.

We really enjoyed this recipe...I did not have enough honey or straight dijon mustard so I used honey- Diijon and it turned out great!  I wish I would have looked at the reviews for cutting down on the butter but still great!  Will use again!

I followe this recipe exactly and I found it to be a bit too mustardy for me.  Very Tender though.  If I make it again I would use a bit more honey.

Dries out too much in the oven.  This is better on the grill.  Also, it is lacking spices - try some paprika & thyme and substitute regular mustard for some of the dijon for more variety.  There are better honey mustard chicken recipes out there.

yummy, I made it with tenders, and they were really good. I will let the tenders sit in the sauce and marinade next time to increase Flavor.

Great way to dress up chicken breast!  Definately cut back on the butter - by at least half.  The honey mustard recipe is delicious - even for other meals!

I thought this was alright. It does have an odd flavor. I usually dont like sweet chicken but next time if I make this again Im gonna add more honey or maybe Cranberry dijon mustard. I added breadcrumbs also It helped out the flavor a bit. Good base needs some help. thanks anyways

This recipe is great for weekdays, when I'm trying to prepare a meal quickly & easily after work. It was good & worth cooking again. But it lacked the 'wow' factor & I wouldn't serve this when having guests over for a dinner party.

There was way TOO MUCH "melted butter." It completely diluted the flavor. Next time I try it, I'll try it without the butter and see if that works.

This chicken recipe is the one I go to when I get home late and still want to cook. Once,I used whole seed mustard instead and it added a subtle new texture to the dish. Very grown-up!

I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup and seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before pouring on the sauce.  I pounded the chicken flat to decrease the baking time.  I was not sure what to expect out of this dish but it was good.  My two boys ate it without complaint and that is all I ask for.  I will be making this again.

My daughter and I love this chicken recipe. The best parts are how easy this is to make, my 14 yr old daughter cooks it, and two the taste. There is so much flavor. It has quickly become a favorite in my home.

I did not care for this recipe. The butter overwhelms the honey and Dijon mustard. The chicken is moist, but for me, the taste is awful.

Pretty good. I just made it for myself, so I just used the one chicken breast and adjusted the recipe accordingly. I added some paprika and lemon juice to the recipe and went light on the butter and honey. I also used Dijon mustard instead of yellow. With these modifications, it turned out perfect served with Mexican rice and green beans.

My wife and I both agree this was OK. There was definitely something missing from the chicken for our taste. I did follow the other recommendations by cutting down on the butter, adding curry and garlic salt to the mixture. It did add some additional flavor. Would make again, but may add some additional mustard and cut back on the honey. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is excellent! I typically enjoy chicken breast much less than any other cut because of its dryness and tough texture. But this recipe produced very tasty results with great texture and juiciness.

This was Yummy! I did add more seasonings. I love seasoned salt, seasoned pepper and tarragon, so I added that to my chicken and I did baste often like it calls for and when the top of the chicken had that nice roasted golden brown top to it, it was ready. Wonderful flavor. It does help to place it in a sort of tin foil boat so that you can get to the juices easier for basting.

Way too much sauce!  I cooked chicken thighs and they were delicious!  Only baked 30 min, then broiled until nice and brown.  Everyone raved!

Wow, what a wonderful recipe. So simple, yet the taste was wonderful. You could definitely taste the honey and the mustard in these. Make sure you turn the chicken and baste 4-6 times during baking. I will make this over and over.

Great recipe! Even my 10 yrs old finicky son liked it. Definitely will make it again. I also added 2 TBSP flour to the sauce at the end.To make it a little richer.

This was very tasty, everyone loved it!  My sauce didn't thicken well, I think I used too much butter.  I turned on the broiler the last few minutes to give the chicken a brown color.  Will definitely make again!

Wow what a fantastic recipe.  I really liked the flavour of the sauce.  I wish i'd have read the reviews prior to making as i would have only used half the required ammount of butter.  It was a bit runny but still very yummy.  I poured the left over sauce over the chicken it was delicious.

We really liked this recipe. I followed some other reviewers advice and rolled the chicken in the sauce before putting it in the pan and then poured the remaining sauce over top. I basted twice during the cooking process. My hubby and I agreed that this chicken makes it into the regular rotation. YUM!

Great flavor! I, as others, cut the butter. I used 1/4C. Promise as I'm cooking for my grandmother who was recently released from the hospital with heart failure. We now eat a lot of chicken, so I'm always looking for something new. Even my husband liked this and he's not big on chicken! We'll definately have this again!

Yummy....yummy! Wouldn't change a thing in the ingredients, but would bake only 30 min. next time. A little overbaked. Especially nice with rice.
