I loved this, but one of my guests thought it was too strong. I would probably add a bit more oil next time to dilute it a bit.

In a word - delicious!  I've never had the honey balsamic dressing from TGI Friday's but if this is it or even close I'm glad I gave it a try.  I put all the ingredients into a mini food processor and let it go.  The only thing I did was to use a low sodium soy sauce and if I want to change this up I would add a little dijon mustard.

This ROCKS!  I halved the recipe (enough for 2 BIG salads) and subbed dried minced onion for fresh (have I ever mentioned I'm kinda lazy?) and (even w/my mod) it was spot on.  I used it for fresh veggie  grilled chicken salads and I was practically licking my bowl!  I wish I'd have had some fresh Italian bread to use to mop up the excess dressing in my bowl.  If you're a vinaigrette lover, this is a MUST TRY!  Thanks for a great salad dressing, CATHYRAE!

Hubs described this aptly when he called it “potent.”  A little does go a long way.  In all fairness we are used to, and prefer, much lighter vinaigrettes (with no sweetness) so we both may be fairly biased.  I used a good, aged balsamic so this was thick, dark and syrupy and might be the reason I found I enjoyed it more than I thought I would.  Still, as tasty as it is, this most assuredly is a dressing you’ll want to drizzle lightly.

Amazing!!!  I used a shallot instead of onion (its what I had), and didn't add sugar initially - instead I added afterward to taste - ended up probably using 2 tsp.  Made in advance, threw in the fridge, and just shook up vigorously before serving over a bed of mixed greens with golden raisins and toasted almonds.  Side note:  I've only used "golden balsamic vinegar" so far to make this... haven't tried with regular balsamic.

This was tasty but very sweet. I think I'll either cut down the honey or eliminate the sugar next time I make it.

This vinaigrette is excellent! I made it for a New Years Eve party and everyone loved it. I omitted the red pepper because I thoght it would be too spicy for my taste. I will definitely make this again. Thanks CathyRae!

This turned out to be delish as is!! Unfortunately I didn't have enough honey left so it wasn't as sweet as I would like. I will definitely be buying more honey and keeping it on hand. Can't wait to make this again.

Yum, Yum, Yum! Simple and so flavorful. I have to admit, I did not have an onion on hand so I just skipped it, and I didn't miss it one bit. I served on top of a chicken mozzarella salad with fresh strawberries and basil from the local farmers market. Can't wait to eat some more today!

So good and easy to make.  Can't imagine it be any better but I used lite soy sauce and jared minced garlic. I would use it again but I'm wondering what the shelf life is.

I made half of this recipe, using part as a salad dressing and part as a basting sauce for grilled chicken, that I served on top of the salad.  I just eyeballed the amount of onion and used my emersion blender to puree it.  Worked beautifully and made a nice emulsion.  I would make this one again!

Good flavor and easy to make.  I did add a pinch more salt than just depending on the soy sauce.  In my opinion, the 1 TB sugar is not necessary.  Test it without, then if you think it needs to be sweeter you can add it.

I did not deviate from the recipe and was rewarded with a luscious balsamic vinaigrette the likes I have never tasted. It was superb.  I used this vinaigrette on top of a spinach, cranberry, and honey-almond salad from this website called Beautiful Salad. It was featured on my Christmas table with rack of lamb and new potatoes. Got rave compliments on this dressing.

Wow!,  This was fantastic.   I used about a quarter of a large red onion and only about 1/2 tsp of white sugar. I can see how this would be a great marinade for pork or chicken.  Next time I would half the recipe because you don't need to use a lot since it's so flavourful.  I'm not sure how long it will keep in the refrigerator when using fresh onion and garlic, which is another reason to make less next time. Definite keeper!

This is excellent with a mixed greens, strawberries, feta, and sunflower seeds.  It is really sweet and potent, so a 2 Tbsp serving can cover a really big salad.

This was a good, basic dressing recipe. I will scale back the onion next time, as it was a bit too pungent for our taste.

I loved this dressing - I put it on the Roasted Carrot salad from this site - delicious.  Although mine came out way darker than the pictures shown here...not sure why, but it tastes good!

Tasty, delicious and perfectly spiced.  Only complaint is that it is incredibly thick- not ideal for a light summer salad.  Still, it is a nice change of pace from bottled dressings!

Great recipe! I didn't have any fresh garlic, so I just used some garlic powder and it still turned out great! Also used low sodium soy sauce and omitted the chilli flakes. I'll be using this again for sure!

This is pretty spicy, but I love it.  I make half a recipe, as I don't like to store vinaigrette with garlic in it for more than a couple of days, even in the refrigerator.  The flavor is deep.  Thanks a lot.

I had this recipe in mind when I threw this dressing together, but didn't actually refer to it. Mixed together honey, balsamic vinegar, olive oil, salt and freshly cracked pepper, and added three cloves of crushed garlic. I let it sit for an hour before using it on a baby spinach/Parmesan salad. Scrumptious! Can't wait to try the recipe as its written, the flavors must be more complex.

Nice dressing, a little goes a long way for me (the vinegar in this was a bit much for me, I prefer more oil to vinegar in my dressings).  I did enjoy the sweetness of the honey and the touch of heat brought from red pepper at the end (I added more b/c I love the sweet and spicy combo).  This will go into my rotation of salad dressings, thanks for the recipe!

My husband is a carnivore, but this salad dressing is his ABSOLUTE favorite.  However I followed the first rater's advice of salt&pepper to the garlic and it was brilliant.  The kraft dressings in the fridge are put to shame.  Easy, great and simple ingredients, right up our ally and my carnivore husband now can consume salads  without the tug of war.

Didn't want to make an entire batch and be stuck with something I didn't like so I did 1/4 cup balsamic, half a medium sweet mayan onion and kept all the other ingredients the same, using a little less than the 2/3 cup extra virgin oil.  Had an 8 ounce glass bottle of some other salad dressing that was empty so I used it to store the dressing I'd just made. Tasted a little of it before putting it into the fridge for salad at lunch tomorrow and thought it was pretty good.  Will be tossing it into a salad comprised of hard boiled egg, tomato, avocado, cucumber, lettuce and tomato. The only thing missing is probably some sesame seeds, for looks.  Thanks for an easy recipe!

Great dressing!  Good coloring with an Asian taste to it!  I decreased the sugar to 1/2 Tbl and increased the honey to 4 Tbl for my personal taste.

This dressing recipe was excellent!  I served it at a dinner party and everyone raved about it.  I didn't have quite enough balsamic vinegar so I added in some red wine vinegar and it still turned out great!

Loved this... so sweet and oniony at the same time. I put it on a "cheese" salad... which is just lettuce, cheddar, mozza, parm, feta, tomatoes and cucumber... so wonderful.

Very good!  I've tried a lot of recipes from allrecipes, and I've never been as happy with the result.  It was very simple to make.  I only added 1 tsp of dijon mustard to help emulsify the ingredients and I chopped up the onions very finely before I mixed everything.  I think it will go great with tonight's baby greens for my brother's birthday!

This was OK.  I can't put my finger on what taste came through that I didn't particularly like.  I will keep looking.

This is great!  Like all dressings it's to taste. I only used 1/4 c oil and rest water. I added 1T miso paste and probably 2T of raw cashews to give it some creaminess. This is a great recipe with changes or stand alone.

I can't get enough of this salad dressing. I crave it throughout the day and on days like today, where I'm out of salad, I try to find something in the pantry to dip it in. It is THAT good!!

We enjoyed this dressing on a red leaf romaine salad with chicken breasts.  My balsamic vinegar was of average quality, but the taste was still good.  I would make this one again.

This was like heaven in my mouth! delicious!!!! the only thing I did different and I know that some people complain about making changes to recipes but you have to give it your own personal touch! so I only used 2 tbsp of honey, and didn't have onion so I gave it a few shakes of minced onion, no pepper flakes because I didn't have any!! OMG it was sooo good, I poured it over grilled shrimp, cooked rotini, blanched asparagus, cherry tomatoes, fresh basil and feta cheese!!

Very good! I cut the recipe in half and used slightly less oil than called for, because I don't like oily dressings. I didn't think it was too strongly flavored of honey or anything else - nice balance of acid and sweetness. Thanks!

Whenever I try making a new salad dressing I always half the recipe.  The only thing I used 1/2 tbls minced onions and 1/2 tsp sugar and the rest was exactly as written.  The crushed red pepper flakes give it a little nice kick.  This is a GREAT recipe.  Going to marinade some chicken tenders tonight.  Should be great too!

This dressing is insane!!! I will never ever EVER!!!! buy store bought dressing again. I did not have fresh garlic I used powdered, I also added some fresh lemon juice and a tiny bit of spicy mustard next time I'll add some fresh ginger to change it up a bit.

This has just the right balance of tangy and sweet; it's very delicious!  I omitted the sugar (the honey is plenty sweet), used 1/2 shallot instead of an onion, and left out the red pepper.  Even my two small boys love this dressing!

We no longer purchase dressing and just use this recipe. I made it in a blender for the first time today with the onions, which was fantastic. However, everything (sans the onions) in a "blender bottle" works perfectly too.

This was delicious! I served it over a spinach salad with strawberries, bacon, and feta cheese.  Be warned that it does have a strong flavor profile (which I happen to like).  Thanks for the great recipe!

Followed recipe with exception of red chili flakes: added about quarter cup for added heat kick.  Poured over leafy green mixed salad with dried cranberries and crushed candied walnuts.   Delicious.   Made extra to leave in fridge for meals this week.

Oh wow, this is tasty! Only change was using 3 cloves of roasted garlic because I had some to use up.  Tangy, sweet with just the right amount of kick from the onion, garlic and red pepper flakes.  I should mention I used a really yummy local raw honey, and I think that gave this an extra depth of flavor.  Really good dressing! Thanks, Cathyrae!

This was excellent, thank you!  I did not have soy sauce, so I added a little dry mustard, to give it a bit of a sweet and sour tang.  It turned out very well and worked perfectly with pasta salad!

This was great, came out very thick, may use as a marinade, great over a salad & following the serving size, this makes a lot, red pepper flakes give this dressing a kick!

If I could give this more than 5 stars I would.  I fell in love with this the first time I made it.  Since then I haven't used any other dressing.  I love how the balsamic vinegar and honey taste together.  Just make sure to blend it well otherwise the onions and garlic leave little chunks, which still tastes good but the texture makes it a little off.

I went hog wild and added a ridiculous amount of the listed ing. after I first made according to directions and it tasted like pure oil. I found out later I had not "emulsified" the mixture well enough--- I don't have Popeye forearms, so I put it in my mini chopper for a couple minutes and this did the trick. Only at that point I had added too much junk! I ended up using as a marinade and was DELIGHTFULLY surprised at how wonderful it turned out. So if using for salad, stick to qty listed and emulsify. If using as marinade, jazz it up with more of your faves listed in the ing list!

I didn't change one bit of this vinaigrette - it's fantastic.  I'm going to make a bottle every week and never have to worry about making last-minute vinaigrette when we have a salad.

had this for dinner tonight. Tasted great but all I can taste now is garlic. I guess next time maybe I would cut the garlic in half and strain it or maybe just crush a clove and let it sit over night and remove it before serving. I dunno, it taste really good while we were eating it so I will fiddle with this and see what can be done

Red pepper flakes are a great change/addition to this recipe!  I accidentally bought honey goat cheese and included about a tablespoon in the dressing and it tasted great and got a bit creamy!  It was great over any salad, especially one with spinach, strawberries, honey goat cheese and French fried jalapeños.  Yum!

Made this exactly by the recipe. It was really great! Best dressing I've had in a long time. The one thing I would change is I would only make 1/2 a recipe for my family of 4.  I did not enjoy  it as much on day 2.

I could drink this.  I did not measure, I approximated into my BlendTec using dried minced onions, 2 garlic cloves, a couple long squeezes of raw local honey, a few grinds of Trader Joe's seasoning that has mustard seed, pepper, salt and some other herbs, a handful of shakes if red pepper flakes. I forgot sugar, but didn't need it. After well blending I poured in the olive oil while it was blending... it turned creamy from emulsifying. I love sweet balsamic, so it worked for us.

My FB post - Delisciousness... over baby spinach, rotisserie chicken, raspberries, blueberries, blue cheese, and chopped cinnamon almonds. Wish I took a picture. Hubby went for 2nds.

I followed the recipe exactly...well, almost exactly. I had a store brand bottle of balsamic vinegar which I used, and the dressing was REALLY strong and bitter.  So, I trashed that, ran to the store and got a good brand, remade, and my wife and I absolutely loved it. We preferred a pinch of salt, which enhanced the flavors greatly. Thank you for sharing a great recipe.

This dressing is simple AND simply amazing!!! So amazing, that I was tempted to have a salad for breakfast!! I used a good quality balsamic, raw organic honey and dried onions (didn't have a fresh one). I might decrease the amount of honey next time since it tasted a bit sweet, but, I'll decide that tonight after it's been refrigerated.  I really can't wait for dinner...it was that good!! I'm sure I'll never buy store bought dressing again!!

This makes a lot of dressing so I halve the recipe.  Also, the sugar should be added to taste as it can be very sweet.  Serve it on a romaine and spinach salad with some toasted pecans and it is delicious.  Golden raisins are also a nice addition and the dressing can also be used as a amarinade. And, finally, if you are out of garlic you can use jarred and diced garlic.

Both my husband and I love it.  I changed it up a bit, by using JD Gourmet Blueberry Balsamic Vinegar.   I added one tbl spoon of Dijon Mustard, and used agave nectar because I ran out of honey.   Everything else I kept the same.     Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Thank you so much for sharing this.  I hate store bought salad dressing, but I'm not a cook, so I've avoided making my own.  This was my first salad dressing and my entire family loved it!  It was easy, easy & very flavorful.  I used it on fresh spinich and salmon salad.

Super easy to make and very tasty!! I modified it slightly by leaving out the onion and substituting ground red pepper for the flakes and it turned out great. Also I used a Lemon Extra Virgin Olive oil. Yum!

I followed the recipe exactly as written, except I substituted a shallot for the small onion, since it was all I had on hand. It it was a huge hit! All of my very picky kiddos, and hubby, loved it.  I served it with a harvest salad I threw together  (spinach, dried cranberries, roasted almonds, sliced Granny Smith Apple, diced red onion and grilled chicken) and it was the perfect complement. Many thanks!!

I suggest 1/2 of an onion is plenty and 1/2 Red Pepper Flakes. To just tone down the bite of the flavor. Using a whole onion, over powered the taste and it was plenty spicy so less Red Pepper Flakes as well.

I really like the mix of flavors, the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it was a little sweet for my taste.  But I'm more of a savory person. Knowing that I omitted the sugar and only used honey, but was still a bit sweet for me.   Next time I will add only 1 or 1 1/2 T of honey.  My family loved it the way it was.

I made the recipe exactly as listed and it's delicious.  I was a little hesitant about adding the onion, but it turned out to be the perfect balancer...keeps the vinegar from making it too sour and keeps the oil from making it too greasy.

This was very good.  I usually follow the recipe the first time I try one however I did not have honey in the house and just could not use white sugar so I left both out.  Tastes great without both if using a quality balsamic vinegar which is sweet on its own.  Thank you.

This is the best salad dressing I have ever made, but I am a particular fan of the sweet-salty combo.  I could seriously drink this stuff, but I'll put it on salad to make it a bit healthier!

Overall this recipe is a keeper! The only change I would make is to reduce the onion by half. It overpowered the other ingredidents. I used this vinaigrette with an apple, walnut, feta salad. I would make this again.

I used maple balsamic vinegar and, because it is sweet, I left out the white sugar. I had no crushed red pepper, so I used a bit of chipotle pepper. The best vinaigrette I have ever had, bar none. I will be making this again!

So tasty!  I left out the sugar and doubled the red pepper.  Next time I will add less onion - I put in half a large red onion, and the onion aftertaste was too much for me.  

Use less than you think you need on your salad, it will be enough!

In LOVE with this recipe, makes me want to eat a salad for every meal! Next time will cut back on the honey & sugar as those are probably the two "worst" things (healthy wise) in it. But just love this dressing!

This is a lovely salad dressing, I made it today with a basic salad of lettuce, red onions, cucumber and tomatoes, even my children who are not much of salad eaters, they loved it. The only modification I made was using garlic powder instead of fresh garlic and cut a bit of the olive oil to reduce caloric intake .. it was great.

Awesome!!!!  Thanks so much.  I thought the soy sauce was weird, but made it exactly like the recipe states and it is amazing!  I used it on a kale salad with apple and almonds.  Perfecto!

Made this for a mixed greens, walnut, Gorgonzola salad & it was a hit! I did leave out the soy(too salty) & used shallot vs onion.  Very easy to make.

This is a really nice dressing.  I used a small shallot and did not blend the ingredients (didn't feel like making more dirty dishes).  I eyeballed most of the ingredients, used a little less oil, left out the sugar, and I think this recipe is really easy to customize to your own taste.  Definitely will make again since it's quick, delicious and I usually have the ingredients on-hand

I made this with Vegetable Oil because I did not have Olive Oil handy. The key to this is using a high quality Balsamic Vinegar! Came out very good. Next time will use a high quality Olive Oil instead.

This is wonderful vinaigrette but a little goes a long way.  The vinegar flavor is prominent, so be sure to use a high quality vinegar.

Easiest thing in the world to make.  I did a taste test before adding the tbsp of sugar and it was already pretty sweet, so I didn't add the sugar.  Actually did this as a dressing to go with "Beautiful Salad" that I found here at allrecipes.com as well.  Loved it!

Great dressing - enough body to let you know you you have a dressing - thicker than regular vinaigrette so you can use less to cut calories.  Declicious.  Only change I made was to use a bit more garlic.  Easy and much better than any store bought. THANKS MUCH FOR THE RECIPE

WOOHOO!! This was delish! I had several guests for supper and they all requested the recipe.  I made it with the "beautiful salad" from this site as well.  Great combo!  I won't be purchasing any bottled balsamic vinaigrette again.  I found the balance of sweetness and tang to be just right.

Oops added too much  pepper flakes, cause we like it spicy.  Kids were drinking water and licking the bowl.

Great homemade salad dressing - easy and quick to make!  I used it on a salad the first night I made it and mixed it with a variety of cut up veggies for a marinated veggie side dish the next and I think the flavors were even better the next day!  It's not overly sweet.  The honey compliments without overpowering that classic vinegar tang.

This was good very good but I hated the taste of raw onion/garlic it left in my mouth. I think I may try it with just garlic powder for flavor.

Delicious balsamic dressing.  We served this over a spinach and romaine salad with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella.  Delicious.  I like it better than our old standby- Annie's organic balsamic dressing.

Delicious! Quick and easy with an immersion blender. I substituted gluten-free tamari for the soy sauce and omitted the white sugar.

This is simply delicious! I am watching my added sugar intake, so I halved the honey and didn't add the additional sugar, and it came out great. Thank you for the recipe.

My husband and I didn't like this.  I only put 2/3 of the onions in, and it was still way to "oniony."  It also makes a whole lot, so unless you know you like it...cut the recipe down.  I might try this again without the onions.

This recipe was amazing. With so many diverse ingredients I was a little nervous about the outcome but the reviews on it were overwhelmingly positive so I gave it a try. My husband rarely gets excited about recipes but he asks for this every week!

Really good. Didnt thinken up much.  Mine was quite dark. Not like the pic at all.  Onion floated to the top so we skimmed it off. Still think it had the flavor though.

I was looking for a recipe that was similar to one that I have at a favorite restaurant.  It came very close, but the consistency is just a little different.    I couldn't bring myself to put the soy sauce in, and I left out the sugar because of previous reviewers suggestions.    It's a super good recipe ... try it!!

Made this vinaigrette for our Christmas Eve dinner, served it on a mixed greens salad with tomatoes, cukes, radishes, red onions, avocado and mixed nuts and dried fruits.  Everyone loved it.  I highly recommend it ~ it is so much better than any store bought dressing.  Thank you CATHYRAE :)

I thought, after reading the reviews, that "if this is good as a dressing, it would probably work as a marinade too."  Boy was I ever right! I used this a marinade for Salmon cooked on the grill.  Unbelievable!  Everyone loved it and claimed that I was an incredible cook.  Thank you Cathy Rae!!!

I had to try this as soon as I saw it, even though it was past my bedtime.  It was very good.  I doubled the garlic and that was great for my taste.  Also left out the tbsp. of sugar and used a smidge of cayenne instead of the crushed red pepper.  Might try white balsamic vinegar next time, as it is my favorite.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good. I cut the white sugar down to half and only used half the olive oil (I ran out *gasp*). This one is a keeper so tasty!! I was going to take a pic of it so the recipe would have one but low and behold it was all gone once everyone tasted it. Maybe next time ;)
