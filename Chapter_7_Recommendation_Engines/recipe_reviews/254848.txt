3.10.17  Easy, definitely.  Confused, yes.  Confused because there’s neither baking powder nor baking soda in this recipe, so how does the cornbread rise???  Considering no leavening ingredient, I just assumed that there was a typo, and this should have been “self-rising cornmeal,” so that’s what I used.  This was a total disappointment because, unfortunately, what I ended up with was dense, heavy, and dry.  I ate one piece, and threw the rest away, something I rarely do.  Jillian Horton I know this is your grandmother’s recipe, and I’m sorry for the bad review, but in all honesty, I simply cannot rate this recipe highly.  There’s not much room for cook’s error here, and this was just a failure for me.

Love this cornbread! Same recipe my mom has used for years, except she’s cooked it so long she doesn’t measure anything.
