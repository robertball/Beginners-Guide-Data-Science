This turned out really good. I used all purpose flour instead of wheat, and i used a heaping 1/3 cup of sugar. I am not a peanut butter fan, but I really liked it!! I made it so my kids could have a neat treat for breakfast. They are both PB lovers. It turned out sweet, and crunchy on the outside. I would definitely make this one again.

a tasty bread.  I added a touch more sugar and baked in small loaf pans for gifts.  Watch the baking time--can really dry out!

Followed the directions and enjoyed it, but it always came out too crumbly for my tastes and not quite moist enough. Don't get me wrong, it was still yummy! Just isn't my favorite peanut butter bread recipe.

I am a HUGE peanut butter fan. I was nervous about this bread, as I had read the reviews prior to baking it, so I added a few things to moisten the bread and make it more appealing to a bigger crowd. - 1/2 cup or so of sour cream - 1 tbsp of ground cinnamon - 1 tbsp maple syrup - 1 tsp ground cloves  I used different amounts of white and brown sugar - it came out peanut buttery and sweet, and I got some good compliments from several folks! I added chocolate chips the next time, and more people were willing to try it, and plenty more liked it.  Altogether not a bad recipe at all!! Thanks!

I made 12 mini bundt cakes, baked at 375 for 35 minutes. I think these could be a bit sweeter, but if you keep an eye on them, they won't dry out.

I enjoyed this bread. I've made it twice, and it's fool-proof. There was a really strong peanut butter flavor, and it became a breakfast favorite. Not surprisingly, it was great with grape jelly. The only drawback was that it did have a slightly dry tecture, but that was fine for me.

Following the receipe as written, I was stumped by"pour batter" the dough looked more like something you would make cookies from. As it turned out, very dry, "Where is the peanut butter taste" Seems  like more of the wheat flour taste than the peanut butter"

Loved this hearty bread.  The PB and whole wheat flour are a nice combo.  I used honey instead of sugar....ummm, ummm good.

I made this exactly as written (except that I forgot to grease the pan, which was a big mistake and made it difficult to get the loaf out of the pan, and to clean it afterwards). This was an interesting recipe, but it didn't wow me. Cooking for 50 minutes (I didn't do the toothpick test until then, but should have) gave me a slightly dry, crumbly loaf, much like previous reviewers have mentioned. And I agree that the whole-wheat-bread flavor somewhat dominated the peanut butter flavor. The suggestions to add some sugar (or maybe some honey?) and more peanut butter might have some merit, I think. I may make this again, but with a shortened baking time, for sure.

Ok, not great.  It is very dry and crumbly and doesn't have much taste.  It needs more moisture, a little bit more sugar and even some more peanut butter for flavor as the wheat flavor takes over and you can hardly taste the peanut butter.  I don't think I will be making this again.

I think it could have used a little more sugar, but I used all purpose flour and crunchy peanut butter and my kids went nuts!!! My husband said it was perfect with jelly.

too much peanut butter! the whole wheat flour added a nice touch though, i would recommend adding yes, more sugar, but cutting the peanut butter to 1/2-3/4 cup.
