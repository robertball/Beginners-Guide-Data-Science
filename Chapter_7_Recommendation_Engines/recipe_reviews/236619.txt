I really liked this (my kids, not so much). I don't care for dark beer, so I used a "German style lager" that I picked up at Aldi. It was just the right amount of beer taste for me. I would make this again!

Made this recipe for an international potluck dinner. I used Granny Smith apples and the only change I would make is to use a sweet apple next time to balance flavor.
