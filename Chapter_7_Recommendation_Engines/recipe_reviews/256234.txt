This stuff is awesome. It tastes a bit like condensed milk but it isn't too sweet and it gets super creamy, too. I added some vanilla bean paste. I froze it in small glass jars to serve individually (keeps the kids from leaving the tub of it on the counter to melt). Only fill it 2/3 full and mix in fruit, jam, rum-soaked raisins...you get the idea. Terrific recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

I have made this several times. To make chocolate add 1 half cup of cocoa powder. Butter pecan melt 2 T butter in a pan. Add 4 oz pecans to pan beat about 3 minutes. Let cool stir into ice cream mixture. Today I added strawberry puree and shaved chocolate. Swirled the puree added chocolate shaving with my mixer. My 1at attempt was strawberries and chocolate chips. Chips got very hard strawberries turned into frozen bites in the ice cream. Strawberries didn't taste had but definitely preferred the puree. I also add about a half teaspoon of vanilla. Love the basic recipe. Stays creamy. No ice crystals. Even better I know exactly safe in it.

This was my very first adventure into home made ice cream and I chose this one because it's easy.    It took a lot longer to set up than I was expecting.   3 - 4 hours.   I'm not sure if this is normal or not.   I did add in vanilla for extra flavor, but I found this with an extremely sweet condensed milk flavor.   After being refrigerated the over night, it still was very soft and very sweet.

Made this and swirled in some strawberry and mango puree.  I read elsewhere that vanilla extract helps to keep it from getting too hard.  I find it best after about 4 hours.  I like the versatility but need to find a version that doesn't have so much fat and calories, but what fun is that? =)
