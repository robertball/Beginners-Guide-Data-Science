This was pretty good but not great. I made this for myself by just putting ice in a glass, adding 7Up, and stirring in rainbow sherbet. This would be refreshing for a hot summer day and is an alternative to a milkshake.

We love this. The only change I make is to omit the ice. I just scoop the sherbet in the glass with the soda and it is wonderful. We love it with orange sherbet!!!

I cut this down to just one serving, which was 2 T sherbet and 1/4 c of ice. Then I just filled my glass with 7-up. This was between good and just OK. I liked having the ice in the drink, but it watered it down too much. I think if I had used beverage cubes made from juice, it would have been perfect.
