FANTASTIC! I was leary of using 1/2 cup of margarine in the crust, and it was pretty oily when I was pressing it into the pan, but it came out great. I used a 9-1/2" springform pan, adding about 8 minutes to the cook time to get it set. I only ended up using 1/2 of the sour cream topping, so I know to halve that next time for my size pan. This cheese cake was one of the firsts that I have made that did not crack at all and did not brown on top...it was PERFECT (and cut beautifully)! I did put a pan of water on the bottom rack of the oven while this was baking, so I'm sure that helped. Creamy, rich and yummy...everything a good cheesecake should be. I served it with salted caramel drizzle and strawberries, mmmmm.... I will def be making this again and again~YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

I served this to our Christmas guests and it was a HUGE hit! My only complaint is the 30 minutes and eventual phone call to my brother's house, to figure out how many (full size) nilla wafers equal 7 ounces. I will save you the trouble -it's 53. You're welcome. I made it in a (greased) springform pan. My crust appeared to be a little burnt but didn't taste burnt at all and there were no complaints.. I served with a raspberry sauce (just a pint of berries and a bit of sugar, blended well in my vitamix, then strained the seeds out). Everyone loved it! Will definitely make this again and often!

This cheesecake was delicious! But one thing I would add, when you're beating the filling, use a low setting. I put it on high and once it was done, the texture was a bit odd and spongey. Still tasted great however, and would make it again!

Really delicious and wonderful size for a crowd. I made it in a glass 9 by 13 inch pan and didn't have trouble with cracks or flaws like I have with some other cheesecakes. I didn't do a water bath or anything like that. It wasn't a thick cheesecake in that size pan but the potions came out as yummy bars that I decorated with a fruit topping. The sour cream topping was subtle. Maybe without the fruit you would notice it more. I used graham cracker crumbs and butter for the crust which was great & what I would prefer. My family loved it and it was not too difficult. A keeper!

Absolutely a crowd pleaser and rather easy to make. Followed the recipe except I used a 10" spring pan with water bath under (as precaution based on other review). Don't know if it was necessary (next time I will try without) and it baked an additional 12 minutes to set. Great recipe - a keeper for sure! Thanks for sharing.

This recipe had me second guessing it, but it was delicious! Lots of raving from friends who tried it. The sour cream mixture put on top definitely enhanced the flavor of the cheesecake and helped mellow the flavor down to keep it from over the top sweet. I will be making this again!

Terrific! I wouldn't change a thing. I didn't even have an opportunity to take a picture because my family devoured it too soon. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This recipe was easy and the results were better than I expected. I made this on a whim and brought it into work. Several people said it was one of the best cheesecakes they'd had. This was my first attempt at a cheesecake so I was thrilled with the result. I made two changes, based on what I had in the cupboard - I used plain graham crackers and unsalted butter rather than the vanilla wafers and margarine. I also prepared a black and blue berry sauce to serve with it, but it didn't need it. It took a full 30 minutes for the cake to set. I will definitely make this again.

DELICIOUS! I made this for Thanksgiving to have something besides the pumpkin desserts and it was a hit! I didn't change a thing and will definitely make again.
