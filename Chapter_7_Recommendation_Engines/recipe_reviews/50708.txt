I used blue mussels, green olives and linguine because of availablity and added a little lemon and fresh parsley. This is simple and delicious! Thanks for the recipe. :)

This was yummy, although it did seem to miss something, I'm not sure what. The first time I made this exactly as stated, the second time I added a couple of Tb's of sundried tomato pesto and a dash of chilli, plus a bit of salt. It was still very nice, but needed a little more oomph. Maybe next time I'll add whole black peppercorns.

Pretty good. I only had pre-frozen mussels since I do not live in an area that you can buy fresh, so I cooked them right at the end and turned them in. The pasta was pretty good, decent flavor, although I do not usually like such a watery sauce on my pasta. I would try again and modify the ingredients to more my liking.

I made this as a light main dish with crusty bread. Very tasty. I used canned fire roasted tomatoes for added flavor. Next time I will use black mussels because I think they are easier to clean and prefer their taste.

It's not a bad start for a tomato based recipe for mussels but it isn't good as is without some changes. Just a few things I did, added more tomato paste and added some toasted fennel and coriander. Wish I would have had some fresh parsley. I'm sure that would have been delicious.

This dish came out great. I used frozen black mussels which worked out nicely. I also added some hot pepper to give it a kick.

We have made this several times and we love it!  We skip the canned tomatoes and use all fresh diced tomatoes from the beginning along with fresh herbs and extra garlic (can you ever have too much?).  Light, healthy and fancy at the same time.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

Used fresh ‘hand-picked out of the salt pond’ mussels from 3 hours earlier.

Have made this twice.  Once with mussels (my kids favorite).  The second time with scallops.  Both times it was great.   Packed the leftovers for my lunch.

For the record, 36 mussels was exactly 1#. That, of course, could be different with other sizes of mussels, but I had the girl at the meat counter count them out this time!
I used all fresh tomatoes  (because I had late season tomatoes fresh from the garden) and left out the tarragon because I don't care for it.  Like others, I added a healthy squeeze of lemon juice, and I added about a quarter cup of chopped fresh cilantro.

Very nice sauce! Used the olives too. My only critique would be that it could definitely use some salt. Obviously, you can add salt afterwards, but it doesn't really get dissolved into the sauce and so the mussels are very hard to salt individually. My suggestion would be 1 teaspoon or so of sea salt when you add the tomato. Definitely going to make this again, as an appetizer with bread on the side, no pasta.

I left out the tomato paste and feel it had very little effect on how it turned out.  I will definitely make it again

Wow!  Amazing.  The sauce this recipe produced had my husband happily dipping the bread in it. Will definitely make this again.  If you have guests coming this will definitely impress your seafood loving folks.  Make sure you use the small mussels they are more tender.
