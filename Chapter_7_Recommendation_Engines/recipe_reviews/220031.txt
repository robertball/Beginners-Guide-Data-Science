Very good and so easy! We used refried beans instead of pintos and cut up chicken breast tenders instead of thighs. We will definitely make this again!

This was quite good and super easy.  I wasn't sure about using that soup, but it was very nice.  Tasted great!

this is so good!  I love to double my batch and freeze the leftovers for an easy meal for another night!    We also like to add rice to it.

This. Was. AWESOME! I made it according to the directions and the meat was so tender and delicious. My husband even went back for thirds!
