A couple things when you're making this recipe.  Firstly, I'd suggest making slightly more dressing than it directs.  The coating is VERY light.  Especially if you add a protein, as I did (shrimp).  

Second, don't let the dressing's taste scare you before you actually dress the salad!  It's definitely meant to be paired with the pickled vegetables.  

I made this recipe in steps and while the rice was a little dry (it had been refrigerated overnight), it was nice to be able to do pieces here and there.  My pickles were refrigerated for a little over 24 hrs and they were still crisp and delightful.  

Ultimately, this still gets three stars because the flavor profile is just a little too tame.  I served the salad cold which does dull flavors a touch but I'd say maybe a little more chili paste.  A little more lime juice.  Just some overall kick!

Made some changes, grocery's store was out of daikon, put in diced cucumbers. It was OK. Not the greatest, but not bad.
