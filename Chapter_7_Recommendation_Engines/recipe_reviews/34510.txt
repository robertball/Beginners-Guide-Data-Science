What is chipped ham??? Yunz gotta be a 'Burgher to know that chipped ham is shaved ham. Any kind of deli baked ham can be used, cut very thinly or shaved. In Pittsburgh, it is "chipped". An early version of this dish used a local brand, Isaly's Chipped Chopped Ham, a rather greasy but tasty composite loaf. One of those things you really didn't want to know what the contents really were. Anyway, I use a similar recipe with more vinegar and brown sugar, and onions and garlic, too. This is a very convenient and good-tasting sandwich to take to a picnic (use the crockpot) or to sell at a fund-raiser.

I live in Pgh now, but I didn't grow up here. Knowing how particular Pittsburghers can be about their ham bbq, I was nervous to try making it myself. But, I made your recipe, and all my hubby's relatives (natives)have absolutely RAVED about it, saying it is the best they've had. It made me proud, so thanks a ton! That was 2 years ago, and I still make it often. I make it exactly as written, too :)

Gotta love anything Pittsburgh! My children were both born at Magee Womens and we lived in da Burgh for 11 years! Anyway, we love these. When in a hurry, I just put the ham in the skillet, put either Sweet Baby Ray's or KC Masterpiece on and get the mixture good and thick, then I add a little Sprite or other lemon lime drink, thicken that a bit and have the most delicious sandwiches! My oldest asks me for these and now can make them himself! Go Pens, Steelers and Pirates!

Tastes just like the barbecue sandwiches I had when I was growing up in Pittsburgh!  I was delighted to find authentic Isaly's chopped ham in the deli at our local store (in the eastern panhandle of WV, no less!). It just doesn't taste the same with anything else! But the "what to drink" suggestion...Riesling??? Really??? Come on, you can't drink anything but Iron City beer with this! I even put a little in the sauce!

I grew up on Chipped Ham Barbecues. I was a little leary of the cinnamon and now wish I'd left it out. This was pretty good, but the cinnamon just didn't do it for me. The tangy-sweet and slightly smoky flavors are plenty, but the cinnamon was overkill. Next time I will leave it out. I also wish I'd had another 1/4 lb of ham to throw in as there was too much sauce letover. Thanks for a good base recipe.

We r from Pgh.. don't live there now so can't get the Islay's but as every1 else suggested just asked for thin sliced or shaved ham. I make it in a crock pot: layering meat, bbq sauce,lil ketchup, sprinkle brown sugar, relish, lil mustard.. just keep layering & stirring & then let all flavors combine on low til warm. Not an actual "recipe" cuz it's all by taste, in our family for years! I made 'em up here in northern NY & no1 had ever had anything like them. Pgh original anyway u make them!

Even if you are not from the Pittsburgh area-you have to give these a try!  Easy to make and ohhhh so good!  Thin sliced or deli "chipped" that is how they actually sell the meat in the Pittsburgh area-which is just ham shaved pretty much-work the best-go the farthest as well, but you can just use sliced ham from the deli as well.  Tavern, honey, smoked, all are good-experiment to see which you like best.  To be honest-we have liked them all and don't really have a favorite!  Go Steelers!

back home, about 40 minutes from PGH, we refered to this as chip chop ham. It's is a staple in many homes in the area. Can't wait to make it for Super Bowl!!! Thanks for bringing back an awesome memory from childhood.

Wonderful flavor!  We really liked it.  The only change I will make next time is to cut the water amount in half.  It was way too runny.

I grew up on chipped ham barbecues in the Pittsburgh area.  We had them at home, at  school and at church club.  My husband had never heard of chipped ham and I couldn't wait to make these for him.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe and Allrecipes for giving the nod to this Pittsburgh favorite in honor of the superbowl!

This makes for a very tasty ham sandwich, and I've gotten a lot of compliments with it. I make it in a slow cooker, but it tends to be very watery and creates a soggy bun. I reduce the water to just 1/4 cup. The water in the ham keeps it from drying out.

I'm from Pittsburgh and this recipe brought me back home...we used to use Isley's chipped ham to make these when I was a kid. This recipe is very good but another way to make it is equal parts chili sauce and ketchup then add 
bar-b-que sauce to taste. Thank you for this recipe! Now I'm homesick!!

YES! A taste of home on a bun! Recently moved to East Texas and let me start by saying it was quite the ordeal explaining to the deli employee what chipped ham was :| and how to shave it thin enough :| I crave the tastes of "Da Burgh" and this hit the spot! Thanks!

I make this for my family often.  Our local store puts Isaly's chipped ham on sale about twice a month and this recipe is fantastic.  The only change I made was to brown the ham in a frying pan until the edges get crispy.  I never have leftovers!!!

I'm sorry.  I am born and raised Pittsburgh and this just doesn't do the trick.  My daughter wouldn't even eat it.  The cinnamon was totally new to me.  Thanks for bringing Pittsburgh into the light, but there should be a better representation of our ham barbecue.

Way too salty.  Maybe I could rinse the chipped ham, but I feel my blood pressure rising.  I will try other recipes to see if they fit the bill of real chipped ham sandwiches,

These ham barbecues are just like the ones my granny made with Isaly's chipped ham!!!    For those of you that are not 'Burghers, be sure to use pressed or boiled ham, and I learned that the translation in Chicago for chipped is shaved!  MMMMMMMM!

I can't believe this recipie is on here!  I'm from State College, PA, but my parents were from south of Pittsburgh so I had LOTS of these as a child.  I just might make them for my hubby tonight!  I never added liquid smoke either - in fact I think we just put ketcup and relish, although I'm not sure.  Thanks for the memories!

We really loved this, a couple of modifications...I added some diced onion and Tobasco sauce. I used garlic powder and no salt. We thought it was a little sweet, so I put in a little mustard before adding the ham. I'll cut the sugar in half next time. Will definitely make this again, maybe tomorrow! We have a lot of leftover ham.

I was raised with these ham bbq sandwiches. My Mother always said you had to use Isaly's chipped ham. That was the secret ingredient. I have been in the Navy for many years, it goes without saying my family moved every three years. The minute I left Pittsburgh, I left ISALY'S chipped ham. Now you can get shaved, you can get it cut thin, but that's the point, make sure you get it sliced as thin as possible, considering your not using Isaly's, you make do with what you have in your area/State. These are quick to make, and are a hit at gatherings like picnics, or when you have a lot of people coming over. My kids like them even more the next day, which Im guessing because all flavors have had time to merry. I strongly encourage people out there to try these. It is different, but they are really yummy! Have a nice winter everyone, Im sure here in ND wont be any different!

Quick and easy! I made this tasty dish with Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce because I didn't have the other ingredients...I also added a dash of A1 Steak sauce. We never had BBQ Ham sandwiches and they were delicious!

Lived on these as a child.  I skipped the relish and cinnamon the second time around.  Not exactly like Isley's or my Mums, but pretty close.

I haven't made these yet, but I know they are going to be great.  I grew up in Castle Shannon right outside of Pgh. and remember being surprised when I was a kid that I liked the barbecues when I found out there was relish in them.  I have been buying jars of the Isaly's barbecue sauce for my barbecues but have been wanting to make a homemade batch.  Thanks so much for the authentic recipe!

Being a Pittsburgh native, I grew up on Isaly's chipped ham barbcue sandwhiches...adding a slice of american cheese and a little more Heinz sweet-pickle relish. This recipe is right on....taking me back many years....Thank You Marcie for the memories.

This recipe is awesome. You can probably leave out the relish, according to your taste. Although, if you can't obtain Isaly's chopped ham, use regular ham. It's not the same--nowhere close--but there isn't any other company who can make chopped ham worth eating. And no, Patsy, chipped ham isn't just shaved ham... It's shaved chopped ham.

Worked in a Isaly's in Clairton.

This was really simple to put together and used things I normally keep on hand. I used mesquite smoked deli shaved ham and mesquite liquid smoke. This had a bit of a bite and was tangy. I didn't care for the pickle flavor though. The sauce was runny and much too thin for my liking. This barbecue sauce had an off flavor like it needed something to balance it out. Overall it was alright but I probably won't fix this particular recipe again. Thanks for sharing though as I always love trying out a new recipe and dish!

No offense, but I am hosting a superbowl party right now and ALL of my guests have very honestly informed me that this is the most terrible Ham BBQ recipe they have ever tasted. I am from Pittsburgh and am embarrassed to even have served this. (Yes i made it correctly, following all directions exactly as written/typed)

I friend gave me this recipe. My hubbuy & son are very picky eaters, they both love bbq chipped ham. But once I tried this recipe they ask for it often. I make it no less than twice a month.The only difference is I put it in the crock pot on high for 3-4 hrs. Turns out perfect everytime.

My husband and I are originally from The Burgh and I have to say that aside from the sweet relish ( which I omitted after the 1st time) is right on the money. The sauce is very much like Isaly'S.Thanks.

I grew up in Pittsburgh--and remember these sandwiches from the Shaler High lunchroom as well as the Burchfield Elementary lunchroom where I taught.  Funny, as we are getting ready for the Super Bowl today, I thought of chipped ham barbecue sandwiches.  A must for today's menu!! but I don't remember my mom adding liquid smoke when she made them.

Excellent! Because I'm on the west coast, finding chipped ham is impossible.  I used high quality Virginia ham and had the deli slice it as thin as possible.  It worked great.  I made this in the crockpot - delicious!

How funny to find this recipe here. I have been making this for over 55 years!!!! However, I don't add the spices, just the ketchup, vinegar, less water and some onion and maybe a little more brown sugar. As I live in TX now this is a great change from the usual beef brisket BBQ made here.

Much better than what my Mother made. I'm convinced she just warmed up ketchup and worcestershire sauce. This has a slight tang with a pleasant sweetness. I skipped the liquid smoke though. It has too strong of a taste for us. We loved it otherwise. Very simple too and economical.

I love BBQ and had a ham to get rid of, so I thought I'd try this. Imagining all these ingredients together made me cringe, but the result was phenomenal! I can't get enough of this stuff and will be making a second batch this weekend. :)

I used left over ham that I chopped very small.  My kids loved it and had second and thirds.  It was a fun spin on sloppy joes and a great way to use up left overs.

I never heard of this til I married a Pittsburgher.  My M-I-L uses spicy ketsup and I make it 1/2 spicy and 1/2 regular ketsup and put it in the crock pot on low for about three hours.  I'm from Philly so I serve on Amoroso's steak rolls.  Easy, yummy and reheats well.

This recipe reminded us of Harvey Ham Sandwiches (which were a lot easier to make).  Still, we liked the taste and could see how the sandwich would have a faithful following.  Thanks for a taste of your town.

I've made this recipe before and it's fantastic!  We used to get these in elementary school...such good memories.  It's not your typical barbecue, maybe only those of us from the Burgh can truly appreciate it.  But I'm cooking up a batch for the Super Bowl this sunday!  Go Steelers!!!

These sandwiches are awesome!!! I left out the liquid smoke flavoring since I could not find it in the store. I froze individual portions in sandwich bags. They are easy to thaw and taste just as good as the day they were made. Delicious!

This is a true Pittsburgh recipe! I usually don't add liquid smoke or cinammon and I think that everyone who grew up in Pgh has their own way to prepare it, but I LOVE HAM BBQ'S!!!!!! And this was great.

I hate to add a negative vote, but we didn't like this recipe. We have eaten much better BBQ than that. Definitely not a keeper.

I added a 1/2 teaspoon of paprika , and cut the water in 1/2.  Ham tends to have water in it.. 
I also cooked it in the crock pot on low for 4 hours

This was delicious. I cooked it in the crockpot. Left out most of the water because I didn’t want it too runny.  Also left out the liquid smoke because I didn’t have any. Finally, I did add a little mustard because I always remembered seeing mustard used when I watched it being made as a kid.

I came across this recipe while trying to figure out something different to do with a ham that had been in mom's freezer just this side of too long.  I cut it into big chunks and put it into a slow cooker with the rest of the ingredients.  A few hours later the ham was so soft and tender and just pulled apart.  BBQ'd ham?!?   She was skeptical at first but one bite and she asked me to add this to our family recipes.

No one uses sweet pickle relish in recipes (potato salad included) and calls it a Pittsburgh or Western PA recipe. We do not add sweet relish to BBQ sauce. That is a Southern thing. We are not the South.

Thank you so much for the recipe. DO NOT add that quantity of sweet relish maybe a teaspoon or less, the relish made the whole recipe taste like pickles and I had to do doctoring to reverse it by adding a can of tomato paste, sriracha and cooked it longer to cook out the strong pickle taste ... everyone at the party absolutely loved it and it tasted like a really good ham bbq. But skip the extra stuff and make the whole recipe then ADD RELISH TO TASTE. And you’ll have a 5 star recipe. Again thanks for posting.

I am a Pittsburgh gal and  remember this dish from my childhood.  I thought it was very good, but next time I would probably eliminate the sweet relish. (I don't think Mom used that when she made it) An excellent and easy dish.

I had a recipe for Barbecued Ham that I couldn’t find so I did a search and found this. I thought it seemed similar to my other recipe so I decided to make it. I was kinda disappointed. It is sooo watery. Taste was ok, but I won’t be making again as sauce is too thin and made a very soggy bun.

These chipped ham barbecue sandwiches are so easy to make and are delicious and inexpensive.  This is great to bring to group events, in a crock pot. My only changes to the recipe is that I omitted the cinnamon, liquid smoke, and I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  Chopped ham is very salty in itself, and I didn’t want to add any extra salt.  I wouldn’t recommend, as other reviewers have, to substitute the chopped ham with other deli hams.  It just wouldn’t taste right.  For those of you not familiar with chopped ham, the deli meat is called chopped ham, and you ask for it chipped.

I grew up in the Pittsburgh area. This has a bit too much  cider vinegar in it. I had to add more brown sugar to it.  Tastes nothing like  what I grew up with.

Was looking for a sixth star, oh well. I'll be 70 tomorrow and grew up there. I've been living in Mountain Home, ID for a couple years now. I try to go back to the burgh every summer. I forgot to get my supply of chipped ham last year, so I stopped at our local Walmart and asked for two pounds. Well I thought they were going to call the men in white coats, then I explained to the woman how to go about cutting me some. Thought maybe I could start a trend here. Took a few slices for her to get it thin enough. I wasn't looking when she began cutting with a manual slicer, felt sorry for her and when she handed it to me said, "Will you please order first when you come shopping so I'll have it ready for you when you cash out?" I just started laughing. I just got back from another trip back home, but this time I went to Giant Igle and pick myself up a few pounds to bring back. Just love the stuff!

Wow! I had Islay's chipped ham that needed to be used for lunch, and one child who was disinterested in a chipped ham sandwich.  I thought, gee Grandma makes chipped ham bbq with Islay's jarred sauce and she loves it.  Maybe I can find a recipe.  A quick search found this.  I had my doubts, but, wow!  With just what I had on hand I was able to create a chipped ham bbq just as good as Grandma's (Jarred)!  I followed exactly but did not have liquid smoke, did not miss it!!   Thank you!!

I only made a slight change to the receipe.I added raw onions and I did not add the liquid smoke.I do not like fake smoke flavoring. I was born and raised in Pittsburgh.This receipe blows isly jar barbeque sauce out of the water.One added ingredient that I definitely liked was the apple cider vinigar.It adds a nice zing to the recipe.Wow!!! I would give way more than 5 stars if I could. Thumbs to the cook who came up this recipe!!!

Very easy recipe except I mixed all ingredients in a mixing bowl (except the chipped ham) then mixed with the chipped ham in the crockpot. Cooked on low for 2 to 4 hours. One of the best if not the best BBQ ham recipes out there.

Love the sauce.   I skipped the liquid smoke because I didn't have any.   Just a little less water next time.   I did double the recipe.

This was a sweet and tangy twist on my usual ham bbq recipe. I loved it.

My husband is from Pittsburgh (I am not) and said this is better than anything he had growing up. I never had it before tonight but it was tasty.

So glad I found this recipe!  Was looking for something different to use up left over ham.  Very very good!  Will make again!

I hate to be the lone dissenter but, these were just your average bbq ham sandwiches. From all the raves I was expecting something more. I think I'll just keep making my bbq sandwiches with Saz's bbq sauce to keep things quick and easy.

I love this recipe.  I make it for family get togethers, and everyone loves them!  I use Dill relish instead of sweet relish.

It's a Pittsburgh thing. This is better than Isaly's.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us.

Can't say enough!  Easy and tasty.  I've shared this recipe with co-workers who had to suffer through me heating leftovers at work.  Everyone loves it.  I did add a bit of finely diced onion.  I haven't added the liquid smoke as our grocery store doesn't carry it and I can't remember to check any others.  My SO would prefer we have these once a week...

This is great! Having had (and loved) chip-chopped ham in Pittsburgh, this brings back memories. I had another, simpler recipe using Heinz chili sauce and brown sugar, but this is better! Thanks for the memories.

As a native Pittsburgher, I really enjoyed this recipe...my mom used to make something similar (but not as good)!  Very tasty on a cold night and super easy.  I served this with Chuck's Mac and Cheese from this site.  Thanks Marcia!

This were absolutely delicious!!  However, I didn't use the liquid smoke flavoring.  Quick and easy to make too.  Thanks a bunch :)

I USED SHAVED EAGLE VALLEY MAPLE HAM. ALSO SHAVED VIRGINA BAKED HAM, THIS IS VERY EASY TO MAKE AND VERY TASTY. MY HUSBAND RON REALLY LIKED THEM AS DID I. WE DON'T CARE FOR LIQUID SMOKE SO I LEFT IT OUT. AND I SERVED THEM ON SEMI HARD WHEAT BUNS.
