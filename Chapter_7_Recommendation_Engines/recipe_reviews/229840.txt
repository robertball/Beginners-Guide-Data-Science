I made this cake for my grandson's 14th Birthday.  He said it was the best carrot cake he ever had.  My daughter is a fabulous baker and  my son in law was a chef. So my grandson gets the best of the best!  The whole family liked it and each of us had two pieces!  It was very moist and so delicious.  I think the pineapple made the cake better.  I was a little afraid to take it out of the Bundt pan but I used a plastic knife around the edges and also set the pan  on a towel in a couple inches of boiling water before taking it out of the pan.  I had read this on a different site and  it came out of the pan almost perfect.  There was one small area that stuck on the side. But once I frosted  it, it wasn't noticeable . Besides it tasted so good. I will make this again.

Absolutely fabulous; I would recommend using only 1 cup of oil. When making a bundt cake make sure you grease the bottom and flour the pan correctly in order for it not to stick. I use Crisco shortening and whole wheat flour instead of white. The pineapple was definitely a nice touch!

I made this for Father's Day & it is now our new "favorite cake"! Everyone else loved it too. I was looking for a carrot cake recipe that had (in addition to carrots) raisins, nuts and pineapple. I chose this one as I was also looking for one made in a bundt pan. I didn't want to mess around with layers. This cake was perfect. So moist! I will definitely make this again and again!

I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins, just because I happened to have them on hand, and I thinned the icing with some of the leftover pineapple juice. I should have thinned it a bit more, but it turned out very tasty!

Great recipe, made the cake using all ingredients proposed.  For the icing I chose to use a ready made vanilla icing that I melted slightly in the microwave and then poured over the top of the cake with a few colored sprinkles and chocolate Easter Eggs for decoration.

Great cake!
Only used one cup of oil and it was very moist.
Also used gluten free flour and it came out perfect.

Perfect as written. Super moist.  Very difficult to get out of Bundt pan - even though pan was generously greased.

The cake tastes great. I wouldnâ€™t make it in a bundt pan again as it was too moist and didnt come out of the pan easily. I had greased and floured the pan. The cake was very moist.
