I made this yesterday and the only reason this is getting a 3/5 is because of the filling. The crust was dry and almost tasteless. I would use a graham cracker crust, as I find it pairs well with mousse-type pies. Though the filling was good, it definitely needed a little more lemon. Perhaps the use of the juice from my one large lemon wasn't enough... I also used Nutriwhip instead of heavy cream. I felt this was alot of work for something that had such a simple taste and look; not really worth it. There is a lemon cake I made from here that tasted much better. I may refer to this recipe again for the filling, not sure.

A total disaster was averted only because I'm an experienced baker and know how to improvise.
