The kids were snowed in from school. We had no pancake mix so I ran across this recipe. I will never buy pancake mix again this is the best really good I added a little more sugar by accident more like a 1/2 cup rather than 1/4cup It was perfect.

I used to do this but as I learned to eat healthier, had to get away from the white flour habit. I now use multi-grain flours and use clambered milk to 'soften'/'condition' the flours so the pancakes are soft and fluffy. As I also use eggs in the batter, that, along with the milk, instead of baking powder, I use just baking soda. I mix the flours together with whatever spices and then add the clambered milk. I let set covered in a warm place at least a hour. Then I add the soda and eggs. I use right away. I use the same method to make herb and or pepper n cheese pan cakes/breads.

I liked the idea of mixing up all the dry ingredients ahead of time and adding the wet ingredients in the morning when everyone is hungry. What a time saver!! I even pre-measured the dry ingredients into 2 cup batches in baggies as an additional time saver, so all I had to do was dump it all into a bowl and add the wet ingredients. Flavor was not an issue; no left overs here! These are a cake type of pancake, so if you like a flatter-type of pancake, you can certainly add a little more water, but be careful not to add too much. I measured my pancakes using a1/4 cup measure and got 12 5-inch pancakes. I am thinking that these would make a nice 'Pancakes in a Jar' type of gift, too. Thanks so much for this recipe. I truly dislike that boxed stuff with mystery ingredients no one can pronounce. I would give you more stars if I could.

Well, we ran out of pancake mix and I came upon this recipe. This is so easy!!! It makes quite a bit so it's great that you can store it for up to 8 months!!! The taste is definitely better than the boxed mix!!! We added some bananas to it and it still cooked evenly and came out excellent. Just as if you were preparing the boxed kind, if you find your homemade mix to be to thin once you've added the wet ingredients, simply add a little more of your dry mix to thicken it up!!! If its too thick, add a tiny bit more water until you have your desired consistency! But once again, very easy & FAST to make, tasty and the consistency was nice, not too dense you know? I LOVE great tasting recipes that involve using things one normally has on hand!! Like some of the other Allrecipes.com members wrote in their comments, I too will NEVER buy boxed mix again... Just great, thanks!!!

This recipe is fantastic. I am now preparing the mix and placing it in Ziploc bags. When my children prepare breakfast for my grandchildren they are not as rushed as if they had to make it from scratch. The only change that I made to the recipe was to use 1 1/2 cups of water as opposed to one cup of water.

This is a great recipe, but never beat pancakes until they're smooth.  It makes them tough.  Beat the wet ingredients together well then gently stir in the dry with a fork just until blended.  A few little lumps are OK.  Just before cooking you can fold in some small chunks of fruit (we like bananas & blueberries), chocolate chips, or my favorite, pecans.  Another thing my kids like is to substitute melted peanut butter (a few seconds in the microwave will do it) for the oil. Delicious!

This pancake mix is seriously amazing! I made these last night while trying to get rid of some extra powdered milk. I made the recipe almost exactly as stated, except for I used less white sugar (I try to reduce sugar wherever possible). Even with the reduced sugar these were so delicious. I think it would be pretty difficult to mess this recipe up. I think I'll experiment next time with some of the ideas given by other posters such as adding melted peanut butter to the batter, fruit, nuts, cinnamon, vanilla, etc. I might also add some cottage cheese to the batter to increase the protein content and if I do I'll tell how it turned out. I used to do this while making "protein pancakes". Another option to increase the protein content is some plain whey powder. It makes a perfectly balanced pancake with protein:carbs ratio.

The recipe as stated though is amazing. I didn't add any extra water, but I suppose you could add just a tad if the pancakes are too thick. But for us the first time, they turned out fluffy and filling. We topped them off with peanut butter and jam! Delish!

I've been making this batter for a while now.  I use whole wheat flour and add oatmeal to it. I'll also powder some chia seeds and add to the mix to make it healthier.  When it's pancake day i use one egg, 1 1/2 cups of mix and enough almond milk so that it has the right consistency (about 1 1/2 cups). My family loves them!

I've used a couple different mix recipes and this one has the best flavor yet. I added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla to it when I added the eggs and water.

I made a half batch of this to start with, just in case we didn't like it. Boy, was that a mistake... I should have doubled it instead! We were out of the first batch in less than a day. These are so amazingly fluffy, way better than a store bought mix. The only down side is that if you're making pancakes for just one person, a half batch is better and then you have to split an egg up...not impossible, but I don't like to waste the other half of egg. Still an amazing recipe!!

It's very good but we have to add far more water than the 1cup stated in the notes otherwise it's extremely thick. Once we get the right consistency it's great.

This is so much better than mixes! To kick it up a notch, I sometimes add 1tsp. Cinnamon and 1/2 a 1 cup finely chopped Apple or 1 cup blueberries. Great for a breakfast for dinner night!

This recipe is great. My family loves homemade pancakes. I stored my mix in a large mason jar and that works perfectly. This recipe beats store bought every time. I followed the recipe and added cinnamon to it.

Excellent.  Kids say these are their favorite. Sometimes I mix in cinnamon or apple pie spice before I add the wet ingredients. Also we use coconut oil.

Very delicious! A single batch, though, makes an odd number of cups. I doubled the recipe and filled pint jars to have premeasured bathes ready to go.

GREAT SIMPLE AND TASTY.
We have made up a large air tight jar with the base and in the morning measure out 3/4 cup of mix, add a room temp. egg and enough water to bring it to the proper constancy. Makes two large pancakes and there is no waste.

Ever since my husband discovered this recipe, he won't use any other. The pancakes are light and fluffy - just like restaurant style.

10 Stars if they had that many. Very simple and unbelievably good. I think the dry milk makes the difference. Seriously, these pancake are like.... Seriously good. Stuck with the receipt straight up, no deviation though I wasn't very precise measuring. Simply added what looked to be the correct amount of ingredients. In other words very hard to mess this one up. A keeper for sure

FANTASTIC recipe! I will never buy store mix again! I made the dry mix, as directed.  Then, I made a triple batch of batter (6 cups of dry mix). I substituted vanilla for some of the water, mixed in 1/2 C ground flax seed, and 15 oz canned pureed pumpkin (along with eggs, water, and oil). O-M-Geeee! These were unbelievably DELICIOUS!!!

I used 600 grams cassava flour instead.   I added an extra egg and extra water to the pancakes and waffles. Turns out excellent! Highly recommended.  My new go-to.

Wow! This recipe really is the best and is far better than anything one could ever find in a boxed pancake mix.  I doubled the recipe and put it in a large airtight canister. To the doubled mix I added 4 teaspoons of cinnamon and 2 teaspoon of nutmeg.  When I made the pancakes, I used butter instead of oil and added one teaspoon of vanilla extract.  The pancakes came out nice and fluffy and very tasty. They were sooo good! The whole family likes them, especially my grandson. Thanks for sharing.

I love this recipe. I have made the pancake mix several times. I also use the same recipe  to make breakfast crepes by adding just a little more water to thin out the batter.

I didn't have powdered milk but the kids were hungry for pancakes so I went ahead without it. They ran it engraved over these pancakes! I did put in a little milk 1%, with the water .

To make this healthier I added a cup of ground flaxseed and a cup of wheat germ. I also increased the sugar to 1/2 cup to make them a little sweeter for my kids.

This was a nice treat.  I did have to add quite a bit more water than 1 cup to make a pourable mix.  The taste was good with peanut butter and syrup.  Thanks for the recipe!

Obviously not quite as good as a completely from scratch recipe using real milk, butter,  etc.  But excellent for a  mix.  So much better than a store bought dry mix.  Those are just junk.  I love this as a quicker option in the morning before school and my family thinks they're great.

It was very nice and fluffy!  However, one side of my pancake would look BEAUTIFUL but the other would have a bunch of holes because of air bubbles...does that mean I overmixed?  I was trying to get rid of all the clumps - too vigorous of mixing?

Wow!  These are amazing and super fluffy.  We have converted, we will never go back to box.
