I was looking for a jar recipe that didn't contain brown sugar (b.c. it gets hard), but still tasted yummy.  Jackpot!!  I did a trial run last night after reading the reviews, and I'm very pleased (after making some changes).  One reviewer suggested using only 2 c. sugar and 3 eggs (thanks!) & that made it fit in the jar perfectly.  To cut down the "all sugar" look, I layered as follows:  flour mixture first, then 1/3 c. cocoa, 1 c. sugar, 1/3 c. cocoa, 1 c. sugar, then the pecans.  It looked better that way.  I used cones I made from printer paper to fill the jar, and after each addition I tapped the jar on the counter to settle the ingredients.  When I mixed up the batch to bake, I did add a tsp. vanilla with the 3 eggs.  As someone else mentioned, it was a little dry, so I added another 1/4 c melted butter for a total of 1 cup.  Just right!!  My husband (who doesn't like sweets that much) had 3 in a row!  They were very moist and delish.  Thanks so much, now I have x-mas gifts!

Ok a few things. First, the taste definitely gets 5 stars, BUT only with the user recommended changes to the recipe. Those changes are as follows: use 1 c. melted butter, 3 eggs, and 1 teaspoon vanilla(this requires you to change the info on the tag you print; trust me you want to do that, i did a test run and they are sooooooooo good w/ the changes). Also, for the ingrediants in the jar it's fine w/ only 2 c. sugar. 
OK second, another major problem is getting everything to fit. I used 1 quart wide-mouth canning jars. You HAVE to pack down everything!!!! I found making my hand into a fist and using my knuckles and back of hand to pack down ingrediants works really well.Pack very tight!!!, seriously.In this order,Flour, baking powder, and salt, PACK!, then cocoa, PACK!, then wipe the inside of the jar with a dry paper towel(it gets pretty messy and will make the above sugar look dirty), then put the sugar (packing here helps only a little bit but still do it). 
*Another reveiwer figured out a clever trick which i will reiterate here "To cut down the "all sugar" look, I layered as follows: flour mixture first, then 1/3 c. cocoa, 1 c. sugar, 1/3 c. cocoa, 1 c. sugar, then the pecans." This works well and looks good, but i ran out of time, so just did the norm way and it looks fine.*

Ok by now there is very little room in the jar, even with all that packing. So I basically improvised. I put about 1/4 c each of nuts and choc chips. You could do just one or the other but my point

I though I'd give this recipe a try before gift giving.  I modified slightly:  increasing butter to 1 cup, adding a teaspoon vanilla, and using a vegetable spray instead of greasing and flouring the pan.  I ended up with moist, tasty brownies that came out of the pan easily.  Needless to say, several jars of this mix will leave my kitchen as gifts.  It is an excellent recipe!

I make these with the changes suggested by the other reviewers, and it is such an incredible hit wherever I serve it. The best part about it is how easy it is to make. (Also, cut out a couple of pieces for yourself when it's right out of the oven. It's gooey and messy but utterly heavenly.) The changes - 3 eggs, 1 cup butter, 2 cups sugar, 3/4 cup pecans, + 1 tsp vanilla essence and 1 cup choc. chips.

I think that the brownies are great, however when I made the jars, the cocoa made them look like a mess.  It was seeping into the other layers and I panicked that I had wasted a perfectly good jar.  I ended up sticking a chopstick down the side about every inch to make it look like sand art.  If I had left it, I wouldn't have even thought of sending it out as a gift.

I made this one night late last week when two friends of mine and my fiancee was over.  It was soooo good!  Everyone gobbled it up before I new it!  I left out the nuts, just because I'm not fond of nuts on my brownies.  I even had to make them again the next night, our friends practically begged, even helped!  The 2nd day we made it i put in a half a cup of milk chocolate chips, it made it taste even better!  I will make these up for x-mas this year!

I was looking for an "in a jar" recipe for teacher gifts at our school.  After reading all the reviews for this recipe, I thought it would be the perfect gift. NOT!  We used one-quart wide-mouth mason jars as the recipe indicated, however, not all the ingredients fit and all you could see was SUGAR.  Not much of a layered look.  I was very disappointed.  All my volunteers ended up using less sugar and JAMMING the nuts in last, which didn't even fit quite as many as I would have liked.  I have yet to taste the recipe, but after all that work, they better be good.  Just disappointed.  I thought they'd look nicer than they actually do, maybe we did something wrong.

We plan to give soup and brownie mixes this year for xmas and although I am not a brownie fan, we had to taste-test before giving these as gifts. My family seemed to like them (although I only thought they were okay-but then again, I am biased as I don't really care for brownies in the first place).  Therefore, these will be packaged for gifts. Be careful with the cocoa! It can make your jar a mess so I would recommend using a filter and letting it "settle" before wiping the jar clean for the next layer. I'm sure these will be well received!

I tried these before making them as gifts and they were good, not the best I've ever had but good (not as moist as I like 'em). I used the suggestion from a previous review to use a paper funnel to get the layers into the jar, I also tapped the jar on the counter to even it out before adding the next layer (it also added a pretty "snowfall" effect). I also did Cowboy Cookie Mix in a Jar (also on this site) for Christmas gifts and thought they turned out much prettier than the brownie mix because they have many more different layers and they were much easier!

Great to give as a gift. When I was ready to bake these, it was really easy to mix and bake. A good idea for busy mom's to make the jars ahead of time and bake them up later when you are in a hurry.

I decided to give this out as gifts this year to some of my friends, but first wanted to make them to see how they tasted.  Both my husband and I thought they were great.  I only made 3 minor modifications to the recipe:  1) I used 5 eggs instead of 4 as the batter seemed a little dry to me without the 5th egg 2) I added 1 tsp of vanilla extract and 3) I add about a 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips into the batter in addition to the nuts.  They had good chocolate flavor and were very moist.  As far as giving as a gift, I had no problems layering or fitting the ingredients in the jar - you do need to firmly pack each layer before adding the next.  Since not everyone likes nuts or may be allergic to them, I packed the nuts separately in a bag and then packed last in the jar.  If using the jar method is too much trouble for you, then simply mixing and adding the ingredients into a plastic bag works great too.  You can decorate the bag or enclose the bag in some type of other decorative container; just make sure the bag is tightly secured/closed.  I've done this method lots of times with "in a jar" type gifts and there are tons of creative opportunities with this method without the hassle.

We solved the "not fitting in the jar problem" by mixing all our white ingredients together. Then we took roughly 1 1/2 cups of the combined white mix and added it to the coca. The result was more brown ingredients to layer with the white. Looks way better in the jar. We had to add a handful of chocolate chips to the walnuts & a wee piece of paper towel at the top because there was so much room! They look great! Added Chrismas material with an elastic band, Raffia overtop and a jingle bell.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and these brownies were HEAVENLY!  Not at all dry - very moist and chocolately.  I was in the market not for a gift idea, but for a brownie mix that I could prepare (several batches) ahead of time and seal in storage bags.  This recipe works great!  You may guess that my family loves brownies, and this is more economical than, and almost as easy as, the boxed mixes.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe.  We made these in PINT size jars with 30 preschoolers in our MOP's program.  It went so well.

I made these brownies as a present for my sister in law last christmas. It was a success!! she tried them and was very happy and pleased because they were very easy to make. I made a tag to go along with the jar with the instruccions and the whole recipe in case she wanted to make them again. I changed two things though: instead of using 2 1/4 cup sugar, I put 1 1/2 cup of white sugar and added 1/2 cup of chocolate chips, and it still worked fine. Great recipe!

Excellent recipe!  This is the first jar mix I have made and I learned very quickly that spaghetti jars don't work because they are too small.  I added lib really quickly by putting the nuts in a baggie of Syran-Wrap and hanging it off the side with the same ribbon that held the instructions.  I thought it looked lovely!

I love this easy recipe. I do make a few changes like some others. I add 1 cup butter and 3 eggs to make it more like fudge and less like cake. And I add chocolate chips instead of nuts.

I made this fat-free by using yogurt instead of the oil and fat-free egg substitute.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla, a few chocolate chips, and left out the pecans.  Oh, and cut the sugar back to 1 3/4 cups.  It obviously didn't taste like a typical fudgy brownie, but it definitely satisfies a chocolate craving in a healthy way!  I liked it with whipped cream and toasted almonds on top, or some raspberry jam spread over.  Yum. =]

I made this recipe (with three eggs) along with Sand Art Brownies and I couldn't tell the difference between the two. Both are super easy to do but I preferred the Sand Art because of the stir-ins.

Try another one. Tested before giving as gifts, and glad I did. Will not be using. Only OK. Not better than ANY box brownie I've made. Also, very cake like. Overall, not worth the ingredient cost.

This is a great recipe.  I made about 12 batches for Christmas gifts this year.  Of course, I had to "test" one first, and it was very good!

Just tested this recipe out to use for holiday gifts this year, and the brownies are delicious!  To make these as friendly as possible for everyone, we replaced the nuts with chocolate chips, which my family loved.  I didn't need the full 25-30 minutes too cook them in my oven, though - when I checked them at 22 minutes, they were finished.

I made these to put in a gift basket for my boyfriends mom for mothers day. I added Peanut Butter chips to top off the jars. They turned out so cute, and I even got to taste the finished product. Great, a rich chewy, gooey brownie. These make great gifts.

The only bad thing I can say about this recipe is that it has too much of dark chocolate taste for me (I am NOT a dark chocolate person). Also, I did not put in the nuts because I hate nuts and it gave the brownies a weird taste. If I make it again, I will definitely add more sugar and will use at least semi-sweet cocoa. I would also say that this mix is even better with chocolate chips! Overall, this is a good mix - if you like nuts and dark chocolate!

great recipe, a little cakey like the other reviewers said even after i just used 3 eggs. still a bit on the sweet side for my family, but just a tad because i usually enjoy my desserts a bit less sweet. i used 2 cups of sugar and 2 sticks of butter like the other reviewers have recommended but will most likely use  1 and 3/4 cups of sugar next time.

Overall, a good brownie recipe. I skipped the packaging part to just make the brownies, and they turned out really well. A bit crumbly, but they were delicious!

YUMMY! Very much a cake-style brownie. I used 1/4c nuts, 1/8 choc chips, and 1/8 M&Ms because they were for a brown and blue baby shower. I followed reviews and used 3 cups of sugar, and vanilla, 3 eggs, and 1c butter when mixing. I also used the suggestion to layer from bottom to top, flour/choc/sugar/choc/sugar/nuts/chips/candy

Right! Like some of the other commenters have said way to much stuff to fit in a regular mouth mason jar. I had to put the pecans and the rest of the sugar in a bag and tape it to the side

I made several for a recent baby shower and was thrilled! I made a slight adjustment by using chocolate chips instead of the nuts, in case any guests had allergies. I ended up needing about 6 oz. (or half of a standard 12 oz. package) to top off the jars.    I was a bit nervous using an "in a jar" recipe, but they turned out so well, and I have only received rave reviews from friends. The brownies turned out moist and delicious. This is a recipe I'll use even if I'm not prepping them in a jar ahead of time.

mine turned out a bit dry. More like a cake. Not moist. I would add a cup of chocolate chips to add those melted moist structure to them.

The layers were a little boring in the jar but the brownies were wonderful, I used canola oil instead of butter and the brownies were wonderfully chewy.  I figured the taste should win over the presentation.

This is by far the best brownie recipie I have ever tried.  I get asked to make it all the time.  Try adding some milk instead of some eggs.  Once I found the batter a little on the dry side so I added some milk and the brownies came out softer then ever.  Almost exactly like the two-bite brownies you can buy from the store.

I just made two pans of these brownies - one as written, the other with the changes that most reviewers made (1 cup melted butter, 1 tsp vanilla, and 3 eggs) and I must say that I prefer them the way the recipe is written - one cup of butter seems to be too much to me. 

 One thing I did do when assembling the jars was to put the pecans into a small resealable plastic bag before putting them into the jars - this way those who do not care for nuts in their brownies (and I have found that many don't) can exclude them if they wish.

Per others' suggestions, I used 1 c. melted butter and only 3 eggs plus 1 t. vanilla flavoring, and swapped 1/2 c. semisweet chocolate chips for the 1/2 c. nuts. I baked mine in an 8x8 pan and increased baking time by 15 minutes, and the results were the thickest, most decadently divine brownies ever. DEFINITELY gift-worthy - package the mix in plastic bags and put that inside a brown paper lunch bag for a cheaper alternative to glass jars. Add a raffia or holiday ribbon bow along with an instruction tag, and put a holiday die-cut on the front with the name of the mix (minus the "in the jar" part). That's how I'm giving mine this year!

Very good jar recipe. I took the advice of other reviews and used 1 c. butter and 3 eggs. To make it look less like a jar of sugar, I made up the flour mix and put half in the jar first. The other half I divided again and mixed in 1/6 c. cocoa, & 1/2 c. sugar and added it to the jar. The next layer I added 1/3 c. cocoa (funnel with printer paper), the 1 c. sugar. I then mixed the rest of the flour mix with remaining 1/6 c. cocoa and 1/2 c. sugar and added it to the jar. Since not everyone likes nuts I made half of my jars with half white chocolate and chocolate chips. Another option would be to wrap nuts in saran wrap so they could add them or take them out if they wish. I used chopped macadamia nuts. USE A WIDE MOUTH JAR! Very tasty!

I made these as christmas gifts this year. But I improvised a little. Alot of my friends are still single and forcing them to make a whole batch of brownies didnt seem right, so instead I cut the recipe in half and put them in pint jars instead. They are still pretty and i did a test run to see if they would come out and they do. Instead of an 8x8 pan I greased a cupcake/muffin pan and place the brownie mixture in it. They were good and turned out alot better then i had imagined! Great gift and I agree with alot of the other users that the cocoa does stick to the side, I recommend using a funnel or a pastry bag to fill the jars, and when packing them remind yourself that maybe it all wont fit but giving your friends options is alot nicer. I placed walnuts, christmas mnms, and mini chocolate chips in bags and attached them to the jars, so when they made them they had the option to use one, all, or none. Great gift idea that helped the ball roll!

I had to change my review after making the second batch which came out absolutely perfect with these changes: 2 cups sugar, 1 cup buter, 3 eggs, 1/2 cup chocolate chips, 3/4 cup pecans, and 1 tsp vanilla. They were so fudgy and yummy! I brought them to work and my co-workers kept asking me to make more! For gifts, I actually decided to go ahead and bake the brownies and put them in Christmas tubs from the dollar store! So cute!

This recipe makes a great looking gift AND a great tasting brownie.  I substituted 1/2 cup chocolate chips for the pecans because of a nut allergy.  I even forgot to add the chocolate chips in my tester recipe and they're still delicious.  

We made the jars at my 8 year old's birthday party, so I mixed the ingredients a little differently than stated to try to avoid the messy cocoa problems, and called it Zebra Brownie Mix.  

I put 1/3 cup cocoa and 1/2 cup flour (plus the baking powder and salt); then one cup sugar (we decreased the recipe by 1/4 cup); next 1 cup sugar and 1/3 cup cocoa; fourth was 3/4 cup flour; then the chocolate chips at the top.  

I separated the five layers into Sharpie-numbered ziploc baggies for each of the girls at the party so they just had to pour them in (no measuring).  Use a wide mouth quart jar and funnel and pack each layer by pounding on the bottom of the jar before adding the next layer.  They turned out great and the kids loved it.

On the back of the cooking instructions tag I put "Zebra Brownie Mix contains:" and listed the layered ingredients so they can duplicate the recipe since it was so good!

I made these up and gave several as Christmas gifts.  I simplified and just mixed everything together and put in the jars because I just couldn't get them to look nice when I layered the ingredients. I added a homespun jar topper and tied the instructions on with jute, and they looked great. But, the most important thing is everyone says they're the best brownies they've ever eaten!

These made very tasty brownies!  I sent a batch with my husband to work & they were a big hit!!

However, as another person mentioned, I wish I had broken up the sugar layer to give it a better look in the jar. Also, I placed a square of fabric on the top of the jar & tied it off with a ribbon--it makes a very nice presentation.  You could also attach a small wooden spoon to the ribbon as I've seen done in the stores (they sell these jars for $10!)

5 stars but only with the following changes. For the jar itself I mixed together flour, sugar, salt and baking powder and then added 1 cup of the white ingredients to the cocoa. Then I layered with 1/2 cup flour mix and a heaping 1/3 cup of the cocoa mix. 

After each layer, tap jar on counter to remove air bubbles and wipe inside of jar with paper towel. This makes 4 layers of flour mix and 4 layers of cocoa mix. I topped with 1/2 cup chocolate chips and left out the nuts due to nut allergies. To make this jar look nice you will need patience and not mind a messy counter. You might breath in a bit of flour and cocoa dust too.  I added a photo for reference.

For the recipe itself I used 3 eggs, 1 cup of butter, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla. This mix is going to be a staple in my home from now on.

Just made this (with the following modifications recommended by other reviewers: 1 cup butter, 1 tsp vanilla extract). Not very good. Decent, fixed my chocolate craving, but not something I'd both to make again.

I also used only 1 and a half cups of sugar, chocolate chips in place of nuts, only three eggs, 1 cup of butter and a teaspoon of vanilla essence and it was yummy. I took them in to work and everyone loved them, I had to share the recipe!

Excellent!  I too, made the recommended changes.  3 eggs, 1 c butter, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 c choc chips, less sugar (I did 2 c. but next time might even do a little less) and no nuts (personal preference).  Brownies are one of my favorite desserts and the best thing is, I can now make them hydrogenated free from scratch! YEAH!!!!

I made this recipe twice--the first as the other reviewers recommended and again exactly as stated on the recipe.  The rating I gave is on the original recipe (3 stars).  

As written, the brownies came out kind of bland and cake-like, yet at the same time too sweet. I will not be making it again as stated.

With the changes other reviewers recommended, it is a definite 5 star recipe.  They are rich, fudgy, and yet not too sweet and I will be making them again for sure.  

If you make no other changes to the original recipe, definitely at least add some vanilla extact, you'll need it!

Oh what a wonderful recipies mmmmm chocolatey and moist I did something different I added 1/2 cup of choclate chips to it and added a chocolate glaze I found from another recipie and made it into a death by chocolate recipie!!!!! My hubby loved them!!!!!! Ok now hubby eats these by the panfull!!!!   Not only that but by melting in chocolate chips it made the brownie better!!  Hubby likes it cause now they have a thin crunchy crust on top then he gets cake then a smooth choclate center then cake again!!!  Hubby makes me slave to make em for him.  But good a diversion for when baking other stuff at least now he can hover over the pan of brownies while I make my pies and cakes!!!!!

After years of bought brownie mixes, these are the real deal.  They taste like homemade and are perfect for brownie sundaes, topped with ice cream and drizzled hot fudge. Of course they're terrific as is, too.  I made up jars for gifts and they were a smash hit!

Okay, I have GOT to STOP saving all these dessert and treat recipes. It's gonna wind up costing me too much money for new, bigger clothes. LOL

This is absolutely the BEST brownie recipe I have ever tried. Hopefully you'll have neighbors to pass half the batch onto. If not, expect to be running out for more milk - which ALWAYS goes with luscious chocolate!

Loved these brownies!!  I used chocolate chips instead of nuts, and the brownies were fantastic.  I haven't tried layering the ingredients in a jar yet, but plan on using this idea for Christmas gifts!

This recipe is THE BEST!  I was in a pinch for a gift this weekend, so my kids helped me make these for some friends without ever having tried the recipe myself.  I made them for my family today and they were GREAT!  Realy moist, rich and tasty!  The only change I made was I used 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips instead of pecans.  I didn't know if our friends liked nuts, and I didn't want to take a chance.  The mini chips worked great.  Added flavor and moistness without being overwhelming.  I would highly recommend this recipe.

Although I did not make this, I did put it together in a jar, and just so you know, all the ingredients did not fit.  I was barely able to fit the sugar, there was no room at all for the pecans.  I'm just saying.

I made these to determine if I wanted to give them as gifts in jars.  These were very good, very chocolately.  If you like dense, chewy brownies, these are not for you.  These brownies are more 'cakey.'

I usually make Brownie Mixes from the store - because they're fast, cheap, and taste as good as homemade.  THIS recipe was as easy and AS GOOD AS store box mixes. MAYBE better.  Definitely a do-again, even for the very high sugar content.  Looks good in a jar.

GREAT mix! You can even give it a fat-reduced option that's quite rich: Instead of adding a whole egg, add the equivalent volume of egg whites and substitute nonfat yogurt for the fat.

I have never made brownies from scratch, and I will not be making them any other way from now on. Everone loved them. Nice and fudgy but not overly sweet or rich. I did take others suggestions and used 1 cup of butter, 2 cups of sugar, would have been too sweet with more than that, half a cup of chocolate chips,1 tsp of vailla,3 eggs and only 1/2 cup of pecans. I also put the batter in an 8x8 pyrex dish so they would be thicker and fudgier, but it added about 15 minutes onto the time. Love it and so did everyone else. much easier to make than i thought, barely any cleanup, and stuff you already have on hand. Thanks for the great recipe!!

i made this looking for a recipe that tastes like the box. perfect. i used 1 cup butter as per other reviews but it would be fine with 3/4c. this recipe makes more batter than the box if you don't want them too deep you could probably use 2 9x9's instead of a 9x13. very good brownies, fudgy.

This is the best brownie mix I've ever come across to in my years of baking.  My family and friends really loved it!  I followed what the others suggested -- that of using 1 cup of butter instead of 3/4.  I also added a chocolate glaze on top using a cup of melted chocolate and 1 cup condensed milk.

This was a very good and easy recipe to make.  I altered it a little bit, I used only 2 cups sugar, 1 cup melted butter, 3 eggs, and 12 cup chocolate chips since I don't care for nuts.  I also broke up the cocoa and sugar when layering it in the jars.  Thank for that great idea.

Very pretty gifts! I liked the simplicity of the ingredients. I suggest using a funnel to get the ingredients in the jar and also wide mouth mason jars might make it a little easier too (I used 1 qt. reg mouth mason jars). I covered the lids with country fabric and tied it with jute twine and attached the instructions to the jute. Very cute looking! I hope my family enjoys these handmade gifts this year!!! Thanks Lisa!!!

This recipe made delicious brownies!  Just what I was looking for to satisfy my chocolate craving.  I had all the ingredients, but had to half the recipe because I only had a little over one cup of sugar available.  We like our brownies more cake-like so I added about 5 Tbsp of water to the batter.  Baked it in a 8x8 pan for 30 minutes and they came out wonderfully moist - just the way our family likes it!  My children keep asking for more.  Too bad we didn't have enough ingredients to bake the brownies in a 9x12 pan.  However, I think my waistline is thankful we didn't!

I think this recipe is awesome!! It's great for a gift for sweet toothed relatives that appreciate homemade  gifts. I only had 1 pint jars, so I divided the recipe in two and replaced the pecans with almonds and marshmallows. Fantastic!! ;)

Being a brownie girl, I had to try it before making this for a Christmas gift. AWESOME!!! I used  1 cup butter, 1 cup flour and added 2 tablespoons each of butterscotch and chocolate chips. Also, if you don't think your recipient will want to use that much butter, half the recipe and put it in a pint jar! This recipe definitely gets 5 stars.

As many reviews suggested, I used 2 cups o fsugar and 3 eggs. I also added 1/2cup of chocolate chips. I baked in a 9x9 pan, so I baked them for 55 minutes. They tasted great. I am giving it a 4 because it's not the best ever, but its close.

These are a great basic brownie!! I adjusted the eggs and butter as other reviewers suggested. I also substituted 1 Cup Splenda sugar blend for the regular sugar. Will definitely be making these again. Thanks for the recipe!!

Great brownies and just as easy as the box kind but MUCH MUCH BETTER!! I used 2 cups of sugar and some vanilla, was still a little sweet so will cut the sugar even more next time. My husband LOVED these. Commented more than once how good and moist they were. This is a real KEEPER!!

I made this mix for a craft fair. I had plenty left over and I'm glad! These are the best brownies and I will never make boxed ones again. These are so easy to whip up and everyone loves them.

I just made the brownies, might try the jars some other time.  I wanted to make these but was out of butter.  I thought I'd experiment to see whether margerine or oil would work.  I made a batch with margerine, one with oil, also used just three eggs and 2 cups sugar, as suggsted (chocolate chips sound good too, but I didn't have any).  The oil batch seemed dry so I added a little water to make it the same consistency as the other one.  I thought both batches tasted good - the one with oil tasted slightly better, with no aftertaste like you sometimes get with margerine.  The only thing I would do differently is to use a smaller pan - these don't rise much.  I'm sure they are great, maybe even better, made with butter, but you can definitely use margerine or oil for a cheaper and (somewhat)healthier alternative.

These are really great!! A very very versatile recipe. I think it is the best basic one I have had. I also altered the recipe. I made two pans of these each differently. First one: 1 cup butter, 3 eggs, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 cup sliced almonds, 1/4 cup sweetened coconut. These gave me a very fudgey cnd chewy brownie, VERY YUMMY!!! Second batch: 1 cup butter, 4 eggs, and 1 1/4 tsp vanilla. This made a very yummy and nice cake like fudgey brownie. Both are very good. But if you prefer thicker brownies the second way is best!! This is now my brownie recipe!!!

These brownies, are absolutely...S-U-P-E-R! They are just right - very rich and chocolatey, gooey, fudgy and slightly chewy. I made them as is but without nuts and I added a teaspoon of vanilla. These are so heavenly, I can easily finish the entire pan all to myself in one day if I am not careful. You have to try them!

I gave these as gifts at christmas.  They were a big hit!  Great flavor but, I didn't like the look of the layers-even after wiping the jar between layers-it still looked messy.  I took the handle of a wooden spoon and pushed it down between the jar and the layers.  It looked more festive-like sand art. I will make again.

I haven't tried the recipe, but the jar was so easy to make.  It's not difficult to make all the ingredients fit.  Just pack them down and if you think there is too much white, seperate the layers more.  A very nice gift for any occasion.  Thanks!

OH MY GOODNESS!! WOW! I am looking for a Homemade Christmas gift idea for my husband’s employees and this is it! I made a trial run for friends last night and we couldn’t stop eating them! My pan was a bit larger than 9x13 so I only baked them for 20 minutes and they were gooey the way I like them! I used DEBMILLIKAN’s recommendations and cut the sugar to 2 cups, only used 3 eggs, added 1 tsp of vanilla and upped the butter to 1 cup. I also used a silver non stick baking pan and coated with Baking Non-stick spray that has flour in it. You will LOVE these super moist delicious brownies whether you put the dry ingredients in a jar or not!!

Very easy and fun to make! I shared this recipe as a DIY Christmas Gift on YouTube. You will most likely want to put this in a mason jar as a gift but be aware you will need a larger container or you will need to use two mason jars.

I made this one for my friends birthday, and she said it tasted amazing! It's good to be creative and abnosome when decorating the jar. Also make sure it's a glass jar, or else whenever you hold it you will mess up the pattern.

I love these brownies! And how easy is the recipe? I have made them using tips suggested by other reviewers - 2 cups of sugar,3 eggs - and they are  great! My children love them and they are so moreish.I get asked for the recipe whenever I make them. They look great in the jar as a gift, too. Brownies and the "in a jar" thing aren't as popular or well known here in Australia, except at my house!

Delicious.  I'm only giving a four because i modifyed the recipe.  I used the 1 cup of butter and 3 eggs.  At first I thought i had mad a mistake.  They were gooey.  After firming up I could describe them as the perfect brownie.  I also substitutes the choco chips of the nuts.

I normally like to follow a recipie exactly like it reads so that I can make my own judgements and then change as needed. I figure I need to give it a fair shot. I have been making my own brownies from scratch for years- and every one loves them- but it is not one you can put in a jar. I did try this so I could give as gifts. I found that I do agree with other readers- too much sugar. I found it a bit to cake like and agree that 3 eggs would be better and make it more fudgier. I am not giving up I will try again with the suggested reviews.

I've been searching for a good brownie recipe that uses cocoa powder instead of the unsweetened baking chocolate squares and I am so glad to find this one! I never have the baker's chocolate squares on hand, but always have cocoa powder.  But when I went to try this recipe I quickly discovered I was 1/3 cup short of cocoa powder, so I stirred in 1/4 cup of dark chocolate syrup and it worked great!  I can't wait to try it with the full 2/3 cup of cocoa. I also reduced the sugar to 2 cups. Thanks for sharing this recipe! I will be making the jar gifts for this in the future for sure!

I usually replace the pecans with peanut butter M&Ms, peanut butter morsels, white chocolate morsels, or chocolate-carmel swirl morsels--> everyone loves them.  They are always a great gift.

This is my new brownie recipe - does not even compare to a box of mix.  I did follow suggestions to change butter/egg amounts, added chips and did not add nuts as personal preference.  Absolute raves for these - Thanks for the recipe!

We made these as just regular brownies... not brownies in a jar.  They were WONDERFUL!!  We took some of the other suggestions and added 1 tsp vanilla and a full cup of butter. We also just sprayed some Olive Oil Pam on the Pan instead the whole grease and flour method. Came out of the pan great!! Nice a chocolatey!!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Well, I made these, and they're just ok.  Definitely add some vanilla and decrease the butter a bit.  I think I'll try the "Sand Art" brownies in a jar on this site before I make my decision. Oh how awful, that means I'll HAVE to eat more brownies...to test them out, you know. LOL! Ally

Most brownie recipes that use melted chocolate are too sweet for my taste so I tried this one because it uses cocoa and sure enough it tastes great! Very moist and chocolatey! I made a few changes -  3 eggs instead of 4 for a fudgier brownie, 1 cup of butter and 2 cups of sugar. I also added a cup of chocolate chips and 1.5 cups of walnuts to give the brownie a little more texture... Will definitely make again!

These are the best brownies ever, especially if you add in chocolate chips. I was the head cook at a summer camp this year, and these were friday's lunch dessert. Counselors counld hardly wait for fridays and campers loved them!!!!

Excellent!  I used an air insulated pan which helped even out the baking and kept them nice and fudgy.  Also, if you don't have a lot of jars around, try using the "disposable" plastic containers.  They come in 1 quart sizes, and you can still layer - they're just harder to decorate.  For close friends and family (especially guys) that will appreciate whats inside more than the outside appearance, it's a great alternative.

extremely delicious! I'm a teen, and I'm very picky about the recipe being easy and simple. This is the absolute best brownie recipe yet! I baked some for my parents, and they loved it so much that they asked me if i could bake more so they can bring it for their friends at work! The pecans were very helpful with the taste! I love it!

This receipe is frustrating because it did not fit in a small mouth, quart jar!  There is no room for the nuts...so if you do try this receipe...be sure to use a wide-mouth, quart jar!

These brownies are indeed delicious, like everyone else said! I've made two batches so far and both have been excellent. I also made the jars to put them in - definitely heed the advice about aggressively packing each layer.

I loved making it with my kids! They had so much fun and so did I.The only thing I would change is the amount of sugar in the jar. I think there should be lots more sugar! Only because I know how 'tangy' brownies can get when not enough sugar. But overall rate is 4/5 stars and they did taste great!!!!

Very easy.  I'd recommend using wide-mouth jar, as it's easier to press each layer down all around.
I shaped and taped a sheet of paper (8.5"x11") into a funnel that fit perfectly into each jar; this made things much easier and much less messy!  Even the cocoa powder did not coat the sides (which the recipe warns about).

I was doing a trial run for Christmas gifts am after cracking eggs and mixing dry ingredients realized we had no butter. I used half a cup of vegetable oil and a quarter cup of water and the brownies came out cakey and delicious. I tried it again with the butter and they were moist and fudgy both ways were good. I cook them for 30 minutes. I used 2 cups of sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla and half a cup of chocolate chips. I like that the vegetable oil and water is so quick and easy and lower in fat. I layered them in the jar doing flour first and then mixing the Cocoa with 1/2 cup of sugar putting half of that for a brown layer, an additional cup of sugar, rest of brown and remaining 1/2 sugar and chocolate chips on top. Will be great gifts!

I'm planning to make these for an upcoming bazaar sale, so made the recipe beforehand.  I had no problems fitting the ingredients into a regular quart mason jar, I had no wide mouth on hand, and the ingredients fit just fine in a regular.  The only change I made when preparing the recipe was to substitute an equal amount of vegetable oil for the butter.  These turned out perfectly & are delicious!  I'm pleased with the recipe & will definately be adding them to the 'recipes in a jar' list for the bazaar.

These were great brownies.  I did follow the changes as indicated by the 7/10/06 reviewer - 3 eggs, 2 cups sugar, etc..  I still found it a tad sweet, so I may even cut back on the sugar another 1/4 cup next time, but all in all, terrific.

I took the others' advice and used 3 eggs, tsp vanilla and some choc chips in lieu of the nuts. Really delicious. Right out of the oven would be really good with a scoop of ice cream on top! YUM!

A wonderful fast mix to make. Makes a good present, but I hate to give a batch away - I want it for myself. ;-)

Sometimes I add a little cinnamon, sometimes some vanilla sugar.

This was my first time making brownies from scratch and they turned out great!  I did a few alterations.
1 cup butter, 3 jumbo eggs, and two cups sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla. No nuts. A great moist brownie!

This recipe was good, but not fantastic. I tried to test it before giving it as a gift, and it went from being very wiggly and underdone to being too dry when I left it in 10 mins longer. I also followed others suggestions and used 1 cup of butter, choc chips and peacans.  I immediately made it again to see what went wrong, and made sure it was not overcooked.  It was better the second time around, but has to be watched carefully.  I also like a thicker brownie,so the 9x13 pan I used the first time produced brownies that were rather flat and thin. The second time around, I used a 9x9 pan & extended the time by 5 mins. Got a higher brownie, but next time I will use an 8x8 pan to get an even higher, fudgier brownie.

I tried these out before giving them out as gifts and found them to be quite good.  The only changes I made was to add 3 eggs, instead of 4, so the brownies would be fudgier, and took other people's recommendatons of adding 1 tsp. vanilla.  As I was layering the mix, I added 1 cup of the sugar, then the pecans, then the rest of the sugar to give it a more layered look.  The sugar mixes down somewhat in with the pecans, but still looks nice.  Be sure to pack each layer down as this BARELY fits into a qt. jar.  Good recipe, Lisa!

Homemade brownies as good as grandma used to make!  Super easy, pretty goof-proof.  I sometimes add chocolate chips or the new raspberry chocolate chips, a nice twist.

I made these for a baby shower favor, attaching cookie cutters for decoration, and both recipients called me and asked for the recipe.  I never tasted them but both women said they were great.  I omitted the pecan in one and my friend said she added leftover Halloween Reese's  cups to hers.  She said they were great with that addition.
