I made this cake for a bake sale and it was a HUGE hit! The only changes I made were out of necessity: I couldn't find orange cake mix so I substituted lemon, and orangecello for the triple sec because that's what I had on hand. It came out of the oven tender, moist, and golden. Oh, and I also "dusted" my bundt pan with granulated sugar, so my cake even had a pretty "salt rim!!" The glaze as written is very tart (and alcoholic!), but I like sour things and when paired with the cake it tasted fine. I would recommend tasting the glaze before you put it on the cake and adjust with added water and/or sugar to your tastes.

Did not have triple sec so I used grand marnier instead. Otherwise made as stated. It was good - maybe not the best ever, but very good. Really, really moist. Smelled wonderful. I didn't care for the glaze, so if I make again I will tweak that a little. All around good recipe. Thanks for sharing.

This is delicious.! However,  for the glaze I omitted the alcohol and just used the fresh lime juice and fresh strawberry juice (which added a nice pink tint)
