Great texture.  Faint raspberry taste and slightly sweet.  I think the 3 T of vanilla is way too much.  I used 2 T and it was more than enough.  Made good toast.  Would be good with a spread of cream cheese and a cup of cocoa.

I know what they say--don't rate it unless you make it exactly--so take my review with a grain of salt.  I wanted a different style of white bread and the yogurt intrigued me.  I didn't want a fruity flavor (and only had plain yogurt anyway) so I used that and nixed the vanilla.  I used low fat Greek style plain yogurt.  I found this dough to require less flour than the recipe called for; I believe I used somewhat less than 3 cups to get a good consistency.  I also didn't use a bread machine, as I prefer to knead by hand; the dough was very heavy and dense when I kneaded it.  I also think I should have let the yogurt warm first as I think the cold yogurt caused the bread to rise slowly.  The bread itself (I made rolls) was dense, moist, mildly tart/yogurt flavored, tender and lightly chewy.  It worked well as dinner rolls, served with butter and honey.  If I made this again, I would warm the yogurt first and try it with butter instead both for the flavor and for the contrast between the chewy inside and what would be a crispier outside.

I made this as written but with strawberry yogurt in place of raspberry.  This bread is moist and slightly chewy, a little sweet without being overpowering.  I personally liked the stronger vanilla flavor, but if you are not a big fan of vanilla I would suggest toning it down a little.  This is good with jam and/or cream cheese.  I am planning on making french toast with it as well.
