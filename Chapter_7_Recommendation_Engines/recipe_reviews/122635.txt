This is the second time I have made these.  I think their is some missing directions.  First off, is whipped topping Cool whip or heavy whipping cream?  Either way mine did not get stiff.  Second, the recipe never states when to add this "whipped" mixture to the egg mixture or flour mixture.  This is not a "1" bowl recipe.   I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon of organic ground flaxseed. My pancakes come out pretty flat.  That may be due in part to the fact I didn't use a "boxed" pancake mix but the homemade pancake mix recipe from this site.  However these pancakes TASTE VERY FLAVORFUL!! I will make again.

These pancakes were quick and easy!  My whole family loved them.  I didn't make the topping for them, but they were great with plain old syrup.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I first had banana nut pancakes in Hawaii and I have searched for a similar recipe for the last 4 years since then and this is a very good version! The only change a made was the topping? I didn't get it... Maybe if it were a dessert but still, I didn't like the sound of it. I served mine with sliced bananas between the pancakes and coconut syrup on top and you really can't believe how wonderful it is. I recommend this as a special morning breakfast that anyone will love

I doubled this recipe, used soured milk, added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and used a cinnamon sugar mix for the tbsp. of sugar. This made WAY more servings than four, unless you have pancake lovers in your family. These browned up really well though they were a bit flat. Flavor was real good, like banana bread. Great way to use up ripe bananas. I'd make these again. NOTE: I didn't make the topping. I could see how it would be good, I just didn't have the ingredients.

These were so tasty!  I followed the recipe except I added 1 tsp vanilla and substituted the nuts for 1/4 cup chocolate chips.  Instead of the topping I thinly sliced bananas and stacked with pancakes along with some butter.  Great Recipe!!  Kids loved it too!

Unbelivably good!! My guests went back for seconds. I warmed some maple syrup and drizzled it over the top. Amazing, thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was delicious. I substituted the pecsns for 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and it turned out really yummy. If I had a suggestion, I would say definitely mash the bananas before you put them in, NOT after. I ended up having really big chunks of banana in my pancakes. But it was still good!

These were delicious!  My kids even gobbled them up.  They do tend to cook more quickly then regular pancakes, so just be mindful to keep a close eye on them.  I also toasted my pecan first...and doubled the recipe so we can have more tomorrow!

Wonderful! Didn't use their topping. Used AR's "Absolute Best Pancake Syrup." Used "Arrowhead Mills Multigrain Pancake & Waffle Mix." 
2nd time: left out the sugar and used olive oil; still awesome!!

I opted out of making the topping, but the pancakes were fantastic. I didn't make any modifications, and the crowd LOVED them. Personally I think an extra banana could be used if you really like banana flavoring, but either way they are great with old fashioned butter and syrup.

What I really like about this recipe is the topping because it goes so well with the bananas and pecans, and is a nice change from maple syrup.  It softens and melts on the warm pancakes, making a wonderful treat for the family.  We all helped make this breakfast.  Even our 3 yr old got into the action, using his new pampered chef child safety knife to slice the bananas!  Thank you so much for a simple recipe that turned into a fun family activity.

Yummy! I followed the recipe other than substituting nutmeg and cinnamon for the sugar. Everyone raved about it. The only issue I had was how thin the batter was but how huge it rised and how it was hard to turn the cakes. It's a way different consistency than regular pancakes, and they're hard to flip, but they're way worth it!

A quick and easy breakfast treat.  I used half of the oil, and brown sugar, and they turned out great.  I also didn't make the topping, as it sounded a little rich for breakfast.  They were tasty with strawberries though :)
