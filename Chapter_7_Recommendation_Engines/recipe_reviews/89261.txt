This classic sauce of sauteed butter, parsley and lemon juice is fantastic.  Definitely saute the garlic or else it will taste too raw, even after it's baked.  I have used this sauce for almost all types of fish- true cod, halibut, basa, tilapia, sole, trout, and salmon.  All tasted superb.  ALWAYS increase the garlic.  For 4 filets, I use 3 large cloves, 3-4 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoon lemon juice. Just make sure you always have less lemon juice than butter or else it will taste too lemony -even when doubling/tripling it.  For a large filet of salmon, I triple the amount.  Lightly salt and pepper the fish for more flavor and I sometimes add 2-3 tablespoon of buttered bread crumbs or finely crushed (buttered) ritz crackers for an extra crunch.  And of course, fresh parsley is better than dried and  use real butter, never margarine.  3 stars for original recipe, 5 stars for slight alterations.  Simple and flavorful marinade that still lets the flavor of the fish shine through. TIP- do NOT bake for 30 min, especially tilapia, which is so thin.  High temperature, quick cooking time is a rule of thumb for all fish.  For this, I did 400 degrees, for 10-12 min (at most!).  If filets are super thin, try 8-10 min.

This is my recipe and I just wanted to add a note here for everyone that you can substitute the butter for 1 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil and it tastes great!

I couldn't believe how easy and delicious this was!   I changed the recipe a little based on suggestions from other reviewers...I saut√©ed the garlic, lemon juice and parsley in the butter before drizzling it over the tilapia, plus I added some red pepper flakes to the mixture.  I covered the fillets with chili powder and I sprinkled parmesan cheese on top when there were only 10 minutes of baking time left.  Absolutely delicious!

I used an idea someone earlier presented - I baked these fillets individually in foil packets.  I used garlic powder instead of garlic cloves (my husband is not a huge fan of garlic) and also added onion powder.  The fish was flaky and delicious and the juices from the foil packets were so tasty over the rice we had with the fish.  Green beans rounded out the meal.  My husband and I want to eat healthier and this recipe will become a regular one, I am sure!

Excellent, simple recipe.  I do agree with outher members on a few comments.  Butter is better, but it can be cut with some EVOO to reduce the saturated fat.  It is better with fresh parsley also.  And, it is a bit bland without a bit of salt and pepper before covering with the sauteed garlic/butter/oil mixture.  I too put the lemon juice over the fish first for a short time.  Be careful not to let it marinate too long or the fish will begin to soften (i.e.cook) due to the acid of the juice and the time for cooking will need to be shortened.  I cooked it for about 10 min. at 400.  Great!!

Easy, quick, delicious -- but DO NOT bake for 30 minutes! Bake for 10 minutes and test for flakiness. If the fish flakes, it's done. Mine was perfect at 10 minutes.

This was very good!!! I did mine a little different. I melted 1 stick of butter and sauteed 3 cloves of garlic and the juice from one lemon in the butter. I seasoned the fish with garlic salt, pepper, and cajun seasoning, poured the butter, garlic, and lemon mixture over the fish and let it sit in the pan with alluminum foil over it for about 2 hours before cooking. I let it cook for about 15 min on 375 and broiled it for about 2 min. It was the best baked fish I've ever had!!

This was quick and easy.  I Melted 2 T. butter in saucepan, then sauteed the garlic, parsley, and lemon juice in the butter. I salted and peppered the bottom of the tilapia fillets, then sprinkled the tops generously with Cajun seasoning (Tony Chachere's). Then I drizzled the butter mixture over fillets, then sprinkled generously with Parmesan cheese. Baked as directed for 15 minutes.  Moist, flaky, and delicious!

The fish is the issue, not the recipe, use another type fish and I'm fine with it. I do not eat Tilapia because of how they are raised. Big fish farms raise fish in huge tanks. They put Tilapia in the tanks to keep the tanks clean, Tilapia eat the feces from the primary fish. After the primary fish are removed the Tilapia are harvested. A recent additional BIG money maker for the fish farms. (I got no problem with making money) That's why you see Tilapia pushed so much. They are basically a freebie to raise (no feed costs!) and almost pure profit. And almost pure.............. "You are what you eat" I'm just sayin'.

For sure a 5*. Only change I made was to add the crushed garlic to the melted butter drizzle over the fish. My tilapia was frozen and I left it that way- straight into the oven. Came out perfect. Thought the lemon would be too much, was wrong... perfect, light and wonderful.  Thanks Eireann.

Incredible.  I used a bit more garlic and put it in the melting butter as one member suggested.  Wow wow wow.  I also used a bit of herb/lemon Old Bay on the filets before putting on the lemon juice and butter/garlic.  Cooked until it was just crispy on the bottom.  If I have my say, this is the only way I will eat tilapia.  Next time I will add a bit more lemon juice but this is fine just as listed.  Give this one a go!   Can I say 'wow' one more time?  :o)

Oh my gosh, is this ever fantastic!  I've made this dozens of times already since first seeing this recipe.  The only thing I do differently is that I use olive oil instead of butter, and I've always used Basa fillets instead of tilapia.  I create individual pouches for each fillet out of aluminum foil, drizzle the filets with the marinade, and then top them with slices of lemon.  I close up the pouch, and bake them in the oven for about 30 minutes.  I've always used frozen fish fillets, so it takes about that long to cook from frozen.  The amount of delicious liquid each fillet produces as it cooks is lovely, it would be fabulous served over rice.  Sooo tasty, I love this recipe!!!

A wonderful recipe!  I bought some frozen tilapia at frozen food section at Target.  To make this fish more healthy, I used canola oil instead of butter.  To add more flavor, thaw and marinate the fish in lemon juice, garlic, canola or olive oil, parsley and fresh black pepper at least a few hours ahead of time.  Don't be afraid to add more garlic.  I used three cloves to three large pieces of tilapia along with some scallions for extra tang and the fish was yummy!  Finally, 15 minutes of cooking time at 375 degrees is sufficient.  I used a small Pyrex baking pan covered with aluminum foil in a counter top toaster oven. Serve this fish with any steamed green vegetable and rice and you'll have a healthy dinner.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was delicious!  I made it exactly as stated, but didn't have to cook for as long as it stated to make sure not to overcook.  I think next time I will cook in aluminum foil to preserve even more moisture. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've got to agree with first reviewer.  More garlic and butter, cook hot and fast.  30 minutes, especially for thin Tilapia filets, is way too long.  415 degrees for 10 minutes or less.   Otherwise, very tasty recipe!

I fixed this tonight for my entire family!  Everyone loved it!  I also put the lemon, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, parsley, salt, and pepper on each fillet along with lots of butter!  YUMMY! I served Onion Rice Pilaf with this as a side dish... recipe also on this site!  Also had garden salad and Best Sweet Basic Bread (recipe on this site) with honey butter!  Fantastic dinner!  This is a keeper! :-)

easy prep and ingredients that one tends to have on hand make this a nice timesaver and light meal.  Rubbed Tilapia w/some Old Bay, Salt and pepper, crushed 1 large clove of garlic, and then lemon juice over top.  I let it marinate for a bit.  I didn't bother melting the butter.  Just diced it and placed over top w/fresh parsley.  Light nice flavor.  If I had white wine on hand, would have used that instead of lemon juice.  The mild flavor of Tilapia allows for alot of diverse ingredients.

Very delicious, while also being light and healthy - definitely highlights the flavor of the fish in subtle way.  I sauteed minced garlic in the butter, used fresh parsley, added salt and pepper to the fish, and baked at 400 degrees for 10 minutes.

This might be my favorite fish recipe ever.  I took the advice of other reviewers on this site, increasing the butter and garlic and decreasing the lemon juice; I used 4 tablespoons of butter, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, and 3 cloves of garlic.  I drizzled the lemon juice over the fish first and then cooked the garlic in the butter and parsley.  (You have to be a little patient with the garlic; since there's nothing else in the pan to absorb the heat, it'll burn really easily, so be sure to cook it on low heat and take it off before it gets brown.  Burnt garlic = icky.)  I cooked it at 400 degrees for 10 minutes and it came out perfectly.  I served it with a salad made from mixed greens, grape tomatoes and herbed goat cheese with balsamic vinegar, and even my husband - who is disinclined by nature to notice such things - thought it was a nice complement.

YUM!  I used lime juice instead of lemon juice because we prefer lime, salted the fillets before drizzling the sauce over them (I sauteed all the sauce ingredients before topping the fish), and doubled the garlic.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and baked it at 400 degrees for about 12 minutes and it was perfect.  I had to fight my younger daughter off of my portion after she had gobbled down her own and my older daughter said she'd love to have tilapia this way again.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Very nice. I used flounder because we prefer that. I grated my garlic on a microplane to get more of a mush that would distribute through the sauce more,  then added it with the butter, 1 tsp olive oil, salt, pepper into a small sauce pan and simmered it for just a few minutes.   I laid my fish out in a pan, seasoned each piece then I spooned the mixture atop each fillet and baked.   We will definitely make this again.

I'm sorry, but the way this recipe is written only earns it one star! We eat a lot of tilapia here in southern California, and I can tell you that 30 minutes to cook it is way, way, way too long! I cooked mine 10 minutes and it was perfect. Also, because I like to keep things simple, I just combined all the sauce ingredients together at once, instead of adding them separately. I decided to cook the sauce a bit before pouring it over the fish because I don't like raw garlic. The way I prepared this recipe was a big hit, and I will make it many more times.

This recipe tasted great...after I made some of the alterations suggested by other reviewers.  I lightly seasoned the fish with Greek seasoning, and then poured on the lemon juice.  I also sauteed the garlic and parsley in the butter before topping the fish with it.  I cooked it at 400 for about 10 minutes.  My family loved it!

I took another reviewers advice and upped the butter to 4 tbs, the garlic to 3 cloves, and left the lemon juice at 3 tbs.  I also sprinkled the fillets with Tony Chacheres seasoning, and sauteed the garlic, butter, lemon juice and pareley before pouring over the fish.  I baked it for about 12 minutes at 400 degrees.  It was fantastic!  I don't even like fish, but it was so good.  My boyfriend loved it as well.  It was a perfect meal with a green salad and some crusty french bread.  Thanks for the recipe and thanks to the other reviewers for the tips!

I am not the best cook so I wasn't sure how this recipe would turn out but it was delicious! I sprinkled some Old Bay seasoning on the fillets before I poured the butter over them. I also sprinkled them with 1/2 tsp garlic and parmesan cheese at the same time that I sprinkled them with the parsley and pepper. This dish is nice and light witha great flavor. Definitely a keeper!

Very good recipe. I also sauteed the garlic in the lemon butter with the parsley and drizzled over the top of the fish right before baking. I also seasoned the filet's with salt and pepper for more flavor. I highly recommend sprinkling parmesan cheese over the top of the fish the last 5 minutes of baking. It adds to the flavor as well. Cook the fish for 10-12 minutes, and it's perfect. I seved with baby red potatoes coated in vegetable oil, and sprinkled with 3 cloves of garlic, onion powder, and lemon pepper. Cooked for 35-40 min at 400 degrees. DELICIOUS!

I made this as written, only sauteing the garlic in the butter first. This was just ok for us, basic to the point of boring.  Adding some breadcrumbs to the top might help.

Since my husband and I cannot eat garlic, I make it without.  First the fish, then salt 'n pepper, parsley flakes, dust panko bread crumbs on the top, then top is all off with pats of butter. lemon juice, and a touch of paprika.  Bake at 375 for approx. 15-20 min.  Easy and excellent.

This recipe gave me a great base for an amazing dish! I sauteed fresh parsley, butter, a splash of French olive oil, 1/4 cup of chopped white onion and garlic until onion was tender. Then I blended together to create a parslet pesto, adding a bit of grey sea salt and pepper. After putting lemon on the fish, I drizzled a bit of the French olive oil, sprinkled a bit of grey sea salt and spread the pesto mixture over the fish. In the same sautee pan, I sauteed another 1/2 cup white onion, 1 cup each of diced green and yellow squash, and 1/2 Tbsp. of Herbs de Provence. I topped the fish with the sauteed veggies and baked at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes. I made a little white wine, dijon and lemon sauce and served it over the fish with whole wheat pasta. SO GOOD!

While I consider myself a fairly accomplished cook, I always have a problem with fish.  NOT THIS TIME!  This was incredible and our new favorite fish.  Living on Maui for the past 6 years, we are used to Ono or Opa, both white, delicate fish.  But you can't find it (not fresh or good anyway) in CA, so this is a perfect alternative for us.  I took the other reviewers suggestions and saut√©ed the onion and garlic before adding the butter and lemon.  I also put some thin sliced yellow onion on the bottom of the baking dish with just a dash of olive oil and s/p.  I also put s/p on the filets then covered them with the butter/lemon mixture.  Baked for ONLY 10 minutes and it was perfect.  I'll make this over and over.  ***UPDATE***  Had this again last night (so good, he asked for it again) and this time I added capers to the butter/lemon/garlic.  WOW.  i'll always add the capers from now on.

I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out great. I have made this for people who do not even like fish and they liked this. It is so simple and fast. I'm a gourmet cook for under $8!

All the ingredients sound right, but this did not add up to a tasty dish. I followed the recipe exactly and what I got was a bland fish. The lemon flavor was definitely there but nothing else. I added lots of salt but this was really lacking in flavor. I won't make this again.

I saute the garlic + lemon juice + EVOO and the butter. I absolutely have to have dill weed on my tilapia, so I replaced the parsley flakes and sprinkled dill weed on the fish just before baking. Very good.

This was wonderful.  I am not a fish eater, but have been trying a few different ones as a healthier option to always having red meat.  This will be a family favorite for sure.  My 6 year old had 4 helpings!!!  I made a few changes as noted by others.  I added more garlic (we love it), used a little more than half a stick of butter, increased the lemon juice (almost tripled), and added parm cheese as well as sea-salt and pepper.  When it was done I broiled it for about 5 minutes to make it a little crispy.

I was tempted by the ease of preparation and the small number of ingredients. I followed the suggestion of sauteeing the olive oil (which I used to replace the butter), garlic, spices, and lemon proir to sprinking, and also put salt, pepper, and parsley directly on the fish before that. Very nice complement to the flakiness of tilapia, but a tad too tart from the lemon. I would add more garlic and olive oil to balance it out.  Update: Much better with butter than olive oil.

It's simple, easy and very tasty.  I placed little chucks of butter on the fillet instead, and sprinkled bread crumbs on top.  I also spreaded minced garlic instead of using garlic powder.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

I used garlic powder instead of chopped garlic, and margerine instead of butter, and it was wonderful.  My 2 filets were done in 25 minutes (maybe a little overdone, even).  Very good, with fairly subtle flavors that accent the tilapia well.

I have made this dish several times and I love it! It is very easy, quick, and always comes out wonderfully. I do add more salt for flavor, and sometimes a little fresh rosemary. Also... this recipe works well with chicken breast - comes out very moist.

My wife does not like fish, ever! However, she does ask for this dish by name. I would highly recommend this for the family that has a picky eater. There is enough fish taste to appease the seafood lover, but it is laid back enough to keep the land lovers at rest.

My husband loves this - but I make it a little differently. I use more lemon juice (he loves a real lemony flavor), enough to surround the fillets. I also sprinkle lemon pepper seasoning on top of the butter (which I put on top of the fillets without melting it... it will melt in the oven) and top off everything with a few shakes of Parmesan cheese. I bake at 375 to 400 for about 15 to 20 minutes. Voila! Pulls apart with ease - buttery, lemony and gone in 5 minutes.

I made this for hubby and the kids for dinner and they enjoyed it. I used 3 cloves of garlic as we are a garlic loving family, and had to omit the parsley flakes as I had forgotten I was out. Instead of baking the fish, I heated the butter in a skillet, then cooked the fish on one side for a couple minutes, then sprinkled the garlic and lemon juice, salt and pepper and then flipped the pieces over. Cooked for another couple minutes, removed the fish, and simmered the pan sauce for another minute, then poured it over the fish. I served this with steamed green beans and homemade almond rice pilaf. Would definitely make this again -- quick and easy!

Nice subtle flavor. I substituted the butter with olive oil and sauteed three cloves of garlic before adding to the marinade. I also used fresh parsley. I wanted to salt and pepper the fillets before covering in marinade, but forgot... next time. Wrapped in foil packets and baked a little longer because the fillets had been frozen. Next time, I'll probably double the marinade to make sure both sides of the fish get covered.

This fish was wonderful though I did change it somewhat.  I placed the fish atop lemon slices which infused lemon flavor while helping to keep the fish from sticking.  I seasoned the fish with lemon juice, old bay seasoning, a smidge of lemon pepper, garlic and butter and toward the end I added fresh chopped flat-leaf parsley. It was delicious though it only took about 20 minutes to be perfectly cooked.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This tilapia was absolutely amazing.

I made several modifications, following the advice of some of the other reviewers.

I increased the garlic to two cloves, sauteeing it in butter before topping the tilapia with it. Altogether, I think that I used approximately three tablespoons of butter (including that in which I sauteed the garlic). I was more liberal in using the parsley, also.

I followed the cooking time suggestion of another reader, and cooked it for 10 minutes at 400 degrees.

The tilapia came out perfectly. It was cooked just right, and was so flavorful and moist.

Thank you for the wonderful recipe, and for all the suggestions that followed! I will definitely use this recipe again!

After topping w/ lemon juice & butter, I sprinkled my filets w/ a bit of riesling wine (about 1/2 cup)& then let them marinade in the fridge for an hour or two. I used fresh minced garlic & added old bay seasoning & onion powder. I didn't find the lemon flavor to be too much at all....I think the wine helped balance out the tartness.I wanted a light & healthy meal (don't we all, this time of year!) so I served shrimp cocktail "martinis" as a starter, this fish dish & Italian Peas (a recipe from this site) w/ a glass of riesling & then blew my diet all to heck w/ a rich chocolate pudding served in tiny (thank goodness!) antique teacups w/ a couple of vanilla wafers on the side. Thanks Eireann...this was quick, healthy, had minimal prep, was tasty & will be  a repeater.

My boyfriend raved about this, and I loved it too. I made two fillets and I recommend doubling the butter and spices for each. It is nice served with roasted potatoes and asparagus. I put some parm cheese on top too!

Made this dish for Christmas dinner for a group of 5, three of whom were quasi vegitarians (they do eat fish).  Used 6 fillets and wished I had used 10.  All raved about the dish.  I did spice it up just a little by adding oregano, crushed red pepper, dill weed, and cayenne pepper -just a pinch of each sprinkled over each fillet.  I would have liked more of the pepper but everyone else thought it was "just right".  The recipe lends itself to easy experimentation with different spices, though probably shouldn't use as many at one time as I did since you lose a lot of the distinctive taste of any one.  All in all, an excellent recipe which will be made again and again.

I let sit in marinade for a few hours before BBQing. It was pretty good, but I think it would have more flavor if baked in the oven in the marinade.

Good, very easy to make. I felt that it tasted like lemon, only lemon. I was a bit shocked when I took my first bite and it was so lemon-y. Tilapia is so flavorless and I felt the garlic and parsley added nothing. My husband liked it more than I did.

Simple, healthy, and delicious.  As mentioned by others, around 15 minutes is enough, and I upped the temp to 400.  I also added a little paprika for color.

Made this with other suggestions.  Breaded the tilapia with italian flavored bread crumbs, added lemon juice, butter, garlic and parsley, then sprinkled parmesan cheese.  This was GREAT.  Will share this recipe and will make again.

Wonderful!  Took advice from other reviews-- sauteed garlic in butter before sprinkling over fish, and baked at higher temp for less time.  We used this for both salmon and tilapia, and it was delicious.  An easy recipe that enhances the fish and lets the true flavor come through!

This was absolutely delicious and a hit with my family.  The only changes I made to is was added another garlic clove and substituted olive oil for butter.  I then sauteed the garlic, lemon juice, and parsley flakes in the olive oil first a bit to cook the garlic some what and infuse the flavors better.  I then poured that over the fish.  It actually only took about 20 minutes to bake, so I would watch the fish after 15 minutes or so instead of 30 minutes. Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely excellent. This is the first time I've made tilapia and this was the best recipe I've tasted! I did as suggested in some other comments and used more butter than lemon juice, and baked at 400 for 10 minutes. I also sauted the garlic in the butter and lemon juice before pouring over the lightly seasoned fillets.   Thanks for sharing this, I will definitely make this again.

This was very tasty and easy to make.  I used the jarred minced garlic and we really like garlic so I actually doubled the amount the recipe called for. The fish was very tender and flavorful.  I served with steamed veggies and rolls.  YUM!

I made this last minute when I had pretty much a bare kitchen. I had lemons and garlic and butter. I am dieting and eat fish a few times a week so finding a good way to change things up is hard to do. I have to say it was quick and easy. I didnt cook the fish for 30 minutes as Tilapia is a thin fillet and it does not require as much. I did 20 minutes instead. Also I added more garlic and Lemon. All in all I loved this fish dish.

Excellent! The flavors were very clean and this cooking method left the fish very flavorful as well as moist! I did use a tad more butter and lemon juice than the recipe called for but my filets were on the large side. I sauteed the butter lemon and garlic before pouring it over the fish to bake which married all the flavors quite well.

Great baked fish recipe.  Nothing super fantabulous, but really tasty!  I did sub in dill for the parsley as I thought it'd be a good little twist.  YUM!  Served with steamed broccoli and a spiced up couscous which I made while waiting for the fish to bake.

If you really love lemon/garlic fish this was wonderfu.  Next time I will use less lemon.  A bit too much even using juice of just one lemon for my taste.  I did saute butter, lemon, garlic, parsley (and added one fresh chopped tomatoe and a dash of cajun spice). I sprayed baking pan with olive oil, placed the thin filets in pan, poured the saute over and baked uncovered.  took 15 minutes only. I was worried it would dry out without foil or something but it was great.  My husband loved it.  He just mentioned it was a bit too much lemon for his taste. I will make this again and again I am sure

Excellent!  Followed the advice of previous reviewers and sauteed the garlic first.  I also substituted the butter with olive oil.  Baked for 15 minutes @ 400 degrees - turned out perfectly.  My 3 year old daughter cleaned her plate, which is a first!!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Delicious.  I'd give it 5-stars as adapted:  Saute together 2-3 TBSP butter, 1 TBSP lemon juice, 3-4 cloves garlic (minced).  Top tilapia fillets/ loins and sprinkle with sea salt and pepper.  Cook at 400 F for 15-20 minutes.  In last 10 minutes, top with bread crumbs and fresh grated parm (more butter if you want it to brown).  We're not a big "fish" family and this was an instant favorite!

This had good flavor and was easy to prepare.  I used all the ingredients in the recipe.  I just did it in this order.  I put the fish in the dish and put the lemon juice on each piece and let set while I started other parts of dinner, probably about 10 min or so.  I also had melted the butter added the garlic and parsley let sit also.  Then just before putting oven I poured the butter, garlic, parsley over the fish.  I had read some reviews that said that it was bland.  I think letting the flavors mix helps.  My son missed the fact that I usually put crouton crumbs on top, so next time I will use this combo of flavors, but top his with his croutons.  O I also did a small dish of scallops this way too.  Thanks

Very tasty and quick way to prepare Tilapia.  I also added red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese. I didn't have any dried parsley on hand, but used dried basil instead.  I put the butter and garlic in a microwave safe dish and cooked it until the butter melted. Then I stirred in the basil, salt & pepper, red pepper flakes, and parmesan cheese.  I then poured that over the tilapia.  It came out great!

I make this dish with a few additions and LOVE it!!! Its so easy and so tasty. I follow the recipe as indicated but add capers and 1 cap full of Zatarain's liquid crab/shrimp boil. Im from Louisiana and use this stuff on just about everything and its FANTASTIC. You have to be a little careful because its very strong but adds a little extra kick to most dishes. After baking the fish I make couscous and serve the fish on top of couscous with a little extra sauce on the side. Ive made this dish for several friends and they all love it. Very tasty.

I have never eaten nor made talapia before and this was easy and so good. I did saute the garlic in the butter first. I poured the lemon on before i sauted the garlic so it had time to sink into the fish. Then I drizzled the garlic butter on and let it sit for about 20 minutes. Then I spinkled a little salt, pepper, parsley and parmesan cheese on and baked!

The basic recipe here is good, however, it is much better with some modifications.  For three medium size pieces of tilapia, I melted 4 T. of butter with three crushed cloves of garlic.  I then mixed in 2 t. of lemon juice.  I poured this mixture over the tilapia and sprinkled the top with dried parsley.  Bake at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes and broil for two more.  The result was over-the-top and wonderful!!

Yummy fish!  My husband thinks he hates fish but he liked this very much.  It was very simple, also.

Watch out for cooking times -- 15 was enough for the fillets I got.

This was my first time cooking tilapia at home and this recipe was easy and delicous.  I followed previous reviewers' suggestions to saute everything together and then pour it over the fish.  It was great and I will definitely make this again!

Really good!  I used a little bit more garlic.  I made this recipe for 10 because I wanted to take some to my father-in-law.  That didn't happen because my 14yo son ate 5 of the 10 pieces!! (no joke!)  We had it with some wild rice and a simple plate of sliced tomato, sliced cucumber, crumbles feta cheese, and fresh basil drizzled with a little italian dressing.  Wonderful meal!  Will absolutely be making it again.

The recipe was pretty good.  The lemon and garlic gave the fish flavor however, it did not need to be cooked for 30 minutes, I would have to say that 10 minutes would have probablly been long enough.  Otherwise pretty good-easy-and I would make it again.

My family enjoys tilapia and this is a very easy recipe as well as tasty.  The only thing I added was dill weed as suggested in another review.

Made this last week for the first time and I'm making it again for dinner tonight! Followed the recipe almost to a T - Only addition was salt and pepper to the fish.  I used 3 large cloves, 3-4 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoon lemon juice. Browned the garlic in the butter and added the lemon juice the final minute of making my sauce.  Spooned over the fish (had about 5 fillets) and baked for 30 minutes @ 400 degrees. Hubby isnt a fishy guy, but he LOVED this recipe!  :)

Just did a little twist and seasoned the fillets before placing them in the baking dish.  Also followed two of the reviewers ideas, sprinkled Parmesan cheese the last five minutes of baking and served it with oven roasted red potatoes, steamed green beans and carrots. Easy and delicious!

Very good. I've made this twice in the last two weeks. The last time I made double the sauce and baked at 350 for about 20 minutes.

Delicious, all three of my children enjoyed it. I added some creole seasoning and let it sit for a few hours with the lemon juice and garlic & refrigerated. Sprinkled with parsley which my son loved, and baked to perfection.

Easy and Delicious! I used more butter than lemon or it's too lemony (3T butter, 2T lemon) and 4 cloves of sauteed garlic. Seasoned with S&P and parsley (fresh is better) and cooked at 400 for 12 minutes (the filets were on the thicker side. Served with steamed broccoli and rice.

Very nice dish. However, BAKING FOR 30 MINUTES IS NOT A GREAT IDEA. I had rather thick filets, and 12-15 minutes at 375F was perfect. Adding freshly-grated parmesan was also a nice added touch and gives complexity to the dish.

This was really great!  I didn't have Tilapia, I had Pickeral, but it was fantastic, I used the baking in tin foil method as I didn't want to lose any moisture, my kids and I loved it, ate every last piece!!

Delicious.  As others have said, saute the garlic and lemon juice with the butter.  Sprinkle salt and pepper on the bottom and old bay and Parmesan on the top.  Bake for about 15 min at 350.

Delicious and simple. For even less prep, simply brush olive oil on fillets and add lemon juice with a dusting of garlic salt.

Do not bake for 30 minutes.  Mine were done in about 15-20 min.  Just make sure to check it at 15min.  The fish had a good amount of flavor with not too much fat.

This was amaaazing! My male cousins and friends were in love, they raved about it the entire meal. I lightly salted and peppered the Tilapia before adding the lemon juice, which I let it sit in for about 5 minutes. Added freshly minced parsley and I mixed panko breadcrumbs and Lots of garlic with the butter before spreading it on the fillets.  I only Let it bake for 10-12 minutes and it was superb!  Will definitely make this again.

delicious and healthy, doesnt get any better. esp on a hot summer day this is a light meal and even my meat loving brother told me more than once how tasty this is. that says a lot! i also sauteed the garlic, half olive oil half butter and added some salt n pepper on the fish. also i found pouring the leftover juices over the fish at the end results in more flavor, since the meatier parts of the fish can taste bland inside.

Great recipe!  I play around with the spices from time to time, and about half the time I pan fry the tilapia while following the rest of this recipe.  I serve it with a rice pilaf most of the time.

I used a lot more garlic and added basil and this was still lackluster.  There are much better tilapia recipes out there, I won't bother making this again.

A really great, simple recipe. I would definitely poke a few holes in the filet to allow the fish to absorb the flavor.  Maybe after the first fifteen-twenty minutes, I would cover the baking dish with aluminum foil to retain the moisture.

Great.  Frozen fillets were on sale, so I got those, and rubbed them in olive oil instead of butter.  Was trying to make it quicker also so I used powdered garlic.  Put the frozen fillets in little foil tents/packets for the amount recommended in the recipe, and it was excellent!  Very flaky with tons of flavor.  Make sure you have lots of lemon to squeeze on it.

This was only my second time preparing tilapia and i thought it was wonderful. I did double the butter/lemon mixture and used fresh parsley and extra garlic. I upped the heat to 400 and thought 12 min would be fine but it was undercooked. I ended up cooking it for 20 minutes and even stuck it in the broiler for a few minutes. I probably ended up overcooking (im still nervous when cooking fish) but i actually really liked the finish product. This is a keeper.

AWESOME! Even the 4 year old couldn't get enough :) Def saute the butter/lemon mix before pouring over fish and I added just a light sprinkle of parmesean cheese on the fish before popping it in the oven for 12 min. Will most definitely be making this one again!

I made this for dinner tonight.  It was only my second time making fish but it turned out much better than the last!  I used frozen tilapia filets and it was still finished cooking in the time stated.  I also used 2 lemons because I had to seperate the filets into 2 different dishes.  I wasn't really sure how much juice you get out of one lemon and I was in a hurry.  It was very lemony.  Sometimes I got a bite that was a bit too lemony so I wouldn't advise using that much lemon.  Other than eyeballing the lemon, I followed the recipe to a "T" and it turned out pretty good!  My fiance really enjoyed it!

We love fish recipes in our home, and this was a bit bland. More lemon juice and Fresh parsley next time? Thank you for sharing.

Very good and easy recipe. My husband said maybe a little too much lemon. My son loved it. First time he had fish that was non-breaded and fried. Will make it again.

for 2 pieces of tilapia i used 2 cloves of garlic, 2.5 tbs butter, 1 tbs lemon juice - sauteed the mixture on the stove (be sure not to burn the garlic) added cilantro (didnt have parsley on hand) and poured over fish (in a pie dish sprayed with non stick). topped with a little salt and garlic powder, and Parmesan and ritz crackers crushed (hubby didnt like the ritz - i loved it!). baked in the oven at 400 for 13 minutes.... yumm! served with red beans and rice and sauteed spinach/onion/tomato mix. UPDATE: did this today without cooking the garlic first and thought it was yummy still. didnt add the ritz either or Parmesan. just took the fish, sprinkled salt, pepper and Montreal seasoning; topped with butter lemon juice garlic cilantro mix and baked at 400F for 12-13 minutes.

Absolutely wonderful!  I made sure to saute the garlic in some melted butter beforehand, and I placed the tilapia fillets on foil and tented them.  I baked 3 large fillets at the temp listed for about 20 minutes and they were melt-in-your-mouth perfect!  Not fishy at all either!

As has been said, this is an excellent and traditional way to prepare baked fish. I added paprika as I like the taste on fish. I will also try lime next time. This I believe would be a good base for fish tacos.

I followed the recipe pretty closely. I did sautee the sauce together before pouring it over the fish as recommended, and I used fresh Italian flat leaf parsley since I had it on hand. I only gave it 3 starts because I thought the lemon was too strong. It overpowered the garlic and parsley flavors.

These are delicious and super easy.  I just sprinkle on some garlic salt instead of minced garlic and add a sprinkle of seasoned salt.  Bake these for 10 minutes and they'll be perfect every time - and I've made them several times.  30 minutes is way too long.  My whole family loves this and it's so quick and easy!

this was very good. the lemon flavor was awesome. i didn't saute the garlic like others said and it wasn't that raw tasting. notice that the recipe says finely chopped... finely chop the garlic and you won't have to saute it b/c it will bake fine in the oven. i used fresh parsley cuz i had it for once. i give it a 4 because the timing was off. 20 minutes in and the sauce had burned (black) around the filets. the filets were still salvageable, so that was good. very good tasting though. i will make it again and again!

Easy and good.  Looking to dress up tilapia a little differently and this recipe fit the bill.  Like other reviewers, I did use fresh parsley -- not a big fan of buying a whole bunch of parsley and use so little, but I can't deny the taste of fresh ingredients from dried.   I think this is one of those recipes you can easily modify to fit your tastes; overall, it provides a nice foundation for making tilapia.

So good! I didnt measure my lemon, butter, and garlic, just winged it. Less lemon next time! But it was super good, especially with rice! We made short grain sushi type sticky rice to go with it - it was delicious and perfect! Cant wait to have again!

This had a great flavor.  I did use more garlic but sauteed it first and used fresh parsley.  I baked it at 400 for less time because the Tilapia fillets I had were very small and thin.  Awesome, thanks for the recipe.

The rating is for this recipe with the suggested variations. I sauted the garlic in butter and mixed the rest of the ingrdients in the butter. Sprinkled Old Bay seasoning over the fish and then drizzled the butter mixture on fish. Sprinkled with parmesan cheese. Baked at 400* for approx. 10 min. until fish flaked with fork. Awesome! The entire family approved.

This dish turned out fantastic!  I took the suggestion of other reviewers and sauteed the garlic, butter and parsley before I drizzled it on the talapia.  I also increased the amount of butter and garlic I used.  I LIGHTLY seasoned both sides with salt, pepper, Old Bay seafood seasoning & paprika before adding the sauce.  Baked for 15 minutes at 325 degrees.  My husband raved about how it was the best fish I've ever made and it tasted like a restaurant-prepared dish.  Served with fresh green beans and a vegetable lasagna.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will definately make again!

super easy and super quick. i used both parsley and dill, and as per recommendations i sauteed the garlic in the butter before pouring it on the fish. also, 30 minutes is definitely too long - mine comes out flaky and tender after about 10-15 minutes.

I'm giving this five stars because of it's potential to be amazing. I agree with the other reviewers, you need to atleast double the seasonings... i.e., the garlic, lemon, butter, and parsley. I added garlic salt, seasoning salt, and a seafood based old bay and it was FANTASTIC! I was afraid it would be too salty with all the additions, but it was just perfect! My boyfriend who usually doesn't like fish, finished his plate and said "this is a KEEPER!!"

Everyone should try this, add your own twist or try it like it is!  

p.s. I wouldn't cook the fish over 15 minutes. Once they start to flake, they're done!

I followed all of MommyFromSeattle's additional suggestions on this one and my husband LOVED it.  He's not a huge fish fan, but said this was the best fish he's ever had and is encouraging me to make it again. We were a little skeptical about cooking these at 400 for just 12 minutes (we tend to eat our food on the 'well done' side), but it was perfect--so moist, flaky and delicious!

I made this because I am very health-conscious and this seemed like a quick, simple meal that wouldn't be anything special but would at least be good for me. But wow! I loved this and can't wait to make it again. I was cooking for one (very hungry) person so I used 2 tilapia fillets. I sauteed the garlic as others recommended. I also, for whatever reason, seem to be out of parsley, so I substituted cilantro. I ended up sauteeing 2 tbsp butter, juice of one lemon, 1 tsp dried cilantro, 2 cloves garlic, and a few red pepper flakes and then pouring that over the tilapia. I sprinkled it with pepper before baking, and with shredded parmesan when there were 10 minutes of baking left. Served over spinach for a fabulous and healthy dinner. Thank you for this recipe, I love it!!

Very, very good.  One of the best fish recipes I have prepared....and SUPER easy.  I made a few changes as suggested by other reviewers.  I rinsed the fish as directed and then sprinkled one side w/ Cajun seasoning.  I then sauteed 1-1/2 T minced garlic and 1 rounded tsp parsley in 2-1/2 T butter.  I used 3 T lemon juice and baked at 400 degrees for about 10 min.  Served with wild rice and a salad.  The sauce was also good on the rice.

Excellent recipe!! The only changes I made were to use 3 lemon slices instead of lemon juice. It still gave me the lemon flavor without being overpowering. I also warmed the lemon slices, butter (which I increased to 2 tablespoons), garlic, parsley and black pepper in a saucepan until the butter melted. It took the raw taste out of the garlic and allowed everything to combine. Then I just poured the mixture over the fish and baked in a foil pouch. Yum yum!!

This recipe is great! I changed it up a bit. I put the garlic, parsley and oil in a food processor, and rubbed it into the tilapia. Then I melted about half a tablespoon of butter into a cast iron skillet. I sauted the fish and served it with asparagus. It was fantastic!

I give this 5 stars for how easy the recipe is. I am just learning how to cook fish, and this was great for a beginner. It tastes great as well, a perfect basic recipe. I did follow another reviewer's advice and used a higher cooking temp for less time (400 degrees @ 12 mins), and added crushed red peppers to the butter.

I really enjoyed this. Gentle flavor. Didnt need to cook it for half an hour though. Definitally use FRESH lemons, not the bottle lemon juice.

My husband and I are very picky when it comes to seasoning fish. This recipe gave the fish a nice fresh flavor. I used cilantro in place of the parsely and lime juice instead of lemon.

This was really great. I followed some other reviewers advice and upped the garlic amount. I used olive oil instead of butter (we're dieting in our house) and used lime juice because I ran out of lemon juice. I also sauteed the garlic and parsely, and added onion like other reviewers. Threw in a splash of white wine as well! Turned out great. My 4 year old declared it the best fish ever.

Pretty good - maybe a little bland if I hadn't increased the garlic (but I increase the garlic on everything.... keeps the vampires away).  I'm sure I'll make this again.

It's good but my husband and I like our Tilapia with a lot of flavor I saut√©ed the garlic, parsley and lemon in safflower oil before I put it on the fish and I know I put more garlic, lemon and parsley in the oil than what the recipe called for cause I didn't measure anything in this recipe I just eyed it and then added more and it tasted like it still needed more, I also added onion powder to it. It was good though just needs more zip to it, next time I think I will add more of the garlic powder, parsley, onion powder on it after it's all done baking, then I am going to cut some lemons in half and serve them with the fish so that we can squeeze it on as we need it.

This recipe is very quick and easy to prepare.  Great meal for a busy week night, but definitely good enough for company with some boiled potatoes and a white parsley sauce. I used fresh parsley on the fish and it burned, so next time will use dried or try as other reviewers suggest and saute ingredients before pouring on fish.

My new favorite way to cook tilapia!!  I melted the butter and cooked the parsley, garlic, pepper and lemon juice together before I poured it over the fish.  Excellent!  The garlic was nice and sweet from cooking in the butter.  Thanks for sharing!!!

One of THE BEST fish recipes ever! I loved the natural garlic/butter/lemon flavor. Given the taste and simplicity of this dish, I'll be making it again and again (probably subbing other types of fish for the tilapia). The leftovers were almost better than the original -- all the flavors married into this glorious symphony of I-don't-know-what. All I can say is YUM!

This turned out so good, and the recipe is so simple and tweakable! I added some chopped pearl tomatoes and about an eight of a cup of white wine in the last 15 minutes of cooking. Tender, flaky and flavorful. Would make again!

This fish was alright - good, but I probably won't be making it again. Too tangy for my tastes, I'd prefer a white sauce or just some butter. I strongly recommend baking fish at 425 for 10 minutes per inch of thickness, just until opaque.

I LOVED this fish tonight.  I usually cook salmon and baked haddock, but Talapia was on sale so I picked some up.  I found this way to cook it and I am so glad I did because I am going to add this to my regular meal rotation.  The fish was almost juicy, not at all dry, very flavorful and well seasoned - with a spicy punch from the garlic and pepper.  I will make this weekly from now on.  Thank you for the recipe.

I had frozen haddock filets so I defrosted them first.  I took the advice of one of the reviews and saut√©ed the garlic in the melted butter for just a couple of minutes and then spread on the fish.  Added the parsley and baked at 375 for about 22 minutes (watched carefully and checked flaking with fork).  Very, very good!

This recipe is so simple & delicious- I think I made it once a week! The only change I make is that I saute the butter and garlic together before adding to the fish. I've made this many times & it always comes out fantastic. I usually make this with some black beans & white rice :)

This is great and so easy!  First, I add salt/pepper to the fillets.  Then, I saute the garlic and parsley in butter and then squeeze fresh lemon juice.  I also add parmesan cheese on top and cook for 10-12 min at 400.  Thanks for a great recipe!

My family loves this.  The 30 min cook time is about right, if your fish is frozen when you start.  Super quick and wonderful dinner.  My kids like the ritz topped filets too.

I substituted cajun seasoning for the parsley.  I used plenty of the spices in the recipe but it was still pretty bland.   After I took it out of the oven, I squeezed fresh lemon and freshly ground salt over the top plus a few more shakes of the cajun seasoning and then it was way yummy!

One word for this dish "wow." My whole family loved this dish and now it goes directly to my favorite list on our keeper book. However, I decreased the amount of my lemon juice to 2 tablespoon only, and as suggested by the others I increased the amount of butter and garlic. We were not disappointed at all. Everyone loved it. Will try to cook this next time replacing the butter with olive oil for a healthier dish. Thanks Eireann =)

I followed this recipe and did not like it at all. There was no flavor. I would have had to add a bunch of salt and I'm trying to avoid having to do that.

I followed other reviewers advice and sauteed my garlic in the butter with the parsley. Next time I won't let the fillets sit in the lemon juice for as long as I did this time.

Excellent!!!! I combined butter, garlic and lemon in a sauce pan and heated through. I dipped tilapia filets in mixture. Then I dredged them through panko breadcrumbs, salt, pepper, parmesan and parsley. Cooked at 400 for 12 minutes and was blown away!  Sooo easy and quick! Yay!! Thanks for the recipe!

Great start to a recipe.  I love that it was simple ingredients and instructions.  Thought it was a bit dry, and definitely cooking too long.   
I followed others advice and sautueed garlic/lemon/butter first.  I added some white wine to the sauce after garlic sauteed.  whatever is laying around the fridge in the way of wine.  Nothing specific. Then poured sauce over fish and cooked at 400 for about 15 mins.  My fillets were frozen, so I wanted them to defrost.  They were a little dried out at 15 mins.

this is a delicious dish, the only reason I gave it a 4 star is that the the cooking time should be 25 minutes.  at 30 the fish dries out a bit.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, just substituting garlic powder for the fresh garlic.  It was pretty good, but definitely needs a little something extra, maybe a little salt for more flavor.  My husband and kiddo ate it all as is though!  I'll definitely make again with a few tweaks.

This was an extremely easy and delicious tilapia meal.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and sauteed the garlic and parsley in the butter.  I used a little more than the recipe called for because I love garlic.  I lined up my fillets and poured the lemon juice over them, followed by the butter blend.  My fillets took the full half hour, but I made 6 in a 9x13 pan, slightly overlapping.  They were absolutely delicious and I will definitely make again.  The only thing I may do differently next time would be to mix the lemon juice with the butter mixture, but just to spread the garlic easier.

I added extra garlic and sauteed it in the butter before baking the fish for about 12 minutes, but I didn't think it had much flavor-just tasted like fish. But it got points for using ingredients I always have on hand.

I'm not usually much of a fish fan, but my husband came home from the store with a bag of tilapia, so I found this recipe and thought I'd give it a try. It was fabulous! I did make one change though: I substituted olive oil for the butter to make it more healthy. We all loved it! I will definitely make this again. It made eating healthy delicious!

My first time making fish. This recipe is great. I chose to grate or "mince" the garlic (I used 2 cloves, I could have used 3. I love garlic) and mixed it with the melted butter. Then I spooned/spread it evenly onto the fish. I also added cayenne pepper because I like a little spice. It still would have been great without the couple things I did differently.

This is FANTASTIC!  Granted, I doubled the amount of liquid/sauce/whathaveyou for this when I baked it, & added a little bit of garlic salt, but overall this basic recipe is good.  Like others, I cooked the garlic first--allowing the flavors to seep into the butter--and added some cayenne pepper, just to help rev up our metabolisms.  I actually added extra garlic (like 5 large cloves) because we like garlic in my family, and used about 6 tbsp. of butter, to about 2-3 tbsp. of lemon.  Perfect amount for us.  Next time, I'll try halving the butter and mixing it with olive oil (or just using olive oil) to see how it tastes, but the ingredients list here is good.  I also baked it at 400 for 10 minutes, and it was perfect.

This couldn't have been easier!! I used 3 cloves of garlic as we like a lot. I also added a dash of oregano.  Next time I think I'll use this as more of a marinade and let the fish hang out in it for awhile before baking. Baked for 20 min at 375 and it came out perfect!

This was the first time I ever made/had tilapia, and it turned out great.  I followed suggestions from other reviews and sauteed about 2 cloves of garlic, 1.5 tbsp butter, lemon juice and parsley before pouring it over the fish.  Also salt and peppered the fish before pouring butter sauce over it.  Cooked it about 15 minutes at 400, and it was tasty.

I made this recipe last night with some of the suggested modifications. Instead of using fresh garlic I used garlic power, a little salt, black pepper and a squeeze of fresh lemon. I put it in individual foil packets and placed a pat of butter on top. I baked it for 1 minutes on 400 degrees. The fish was so tender and the sauce in the packet was great over the white rice.

Thanks I was a hero to my family :)

Good.  The lemon flavor didn't really come through, the next time I will throw some slices of lemon on top of the fish too.  I doubled the garlic and added a little salt.  Easy and fast.

Good and very easy to make.  Only takes 5 minutes to put together and get in the oven.  Great with asparagus baked in the oven with parmesan.

This was delicious! I live alone and wanted something easy, healthy and quick for dinner. This ended up being the perfect choice! I did change the recipe a bit - using the suggestions from other reviewers:
First, I used 1 tbsp of olive oil instead of the butter, and saut√©ed it with the lemon juice, garlic and parsley for about 30 seconds before pouring it over the fish. I cooked the fish in a foil packet at 400 for about 10 minutes, and it came out perfectly - I would definitely not cook it for any longer than that. I served it over rice with a side of veggies, and the lemon/garlic sauce was delicious with the rice. A healthy and filling meal that took about 20 mins total to make. I'll be doing this again!

This is so easy and delicious, what's not to love? The simple combination of lemon, garlic and butter are a perfect compliment to the mild flavor of tilapia. I followed the recipe with the exception of adding a sprinkle of salt. Next time I will cook the garlic in the butter on the stovetop a bit before adding to the tilapia.

FABULOUS! I did add a couple more tablespoons of butter and a couple more cloves of garlic and crushed red pepper. I baked them wrapped in foil and it was awesome. I used the Oven-Roasted Asparagus recipe for a side dish. Best homemade fish recipe I've eaten!

Wonderful!!!  I used olive oil instead of butter and I didn't miss a thing.  We used this on our ling cod and it was great.  I will definitely be making this again.  It's super easy and the ingredients are most always in our house.  Thanks!

This was absolutely delicious! Very flavorful. I sauteed the garlic in butter first then poured it over the filets in a glass baking dish, adding the lemon juice and parsley flakes, and baked at 375 for 12 minutes. I also added some grated parmesan and it turned out fantastic! Picky eaters liked it as well!

Easy, healthy, uses pantry staples, and was ready in 20 minutes.  The only thing it needs is a little salt, but that's an easy fix.  I will definitely have this again!

WAY too much lemon. This is from the girl who squeezes lemon juice onto her french fries. It was over powering. I think the butter to lemon should be more like 2 parts butter to 1 part lemon. And definitely increase the garlic. I love the lemon -parsley -butter combo with fish just use different ratios then recipe.

I added shallots and used thyme instead of parsley.  Saute them with the garlic and add to the melted butter. I added the lemon juice a few mins later and served the butter mixture over the cooked fish. It turned out so good, my boyfriend that usually hates fish ate 3 helpings!

This was wonderful. Honestly, I read the recipe and left it at work and got home and thought, whoops. I ended up taking a little twist on everyone's advice. I placed the tilapia slices in tinfoil and put a tiny bit of olive oil down the center. Flavored it with garlic and herb seasoning, fresh parsley and two slices of lemon. Crimped the foil and let it cook at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes (didn't time it, just watched it) . I checked it to ensure it was getting done and when all said and done, my husband was stealing mine off of my plate. It was melt in your mouth fall apart delicious. I will try with the fresh garlic cloves and butter next time

This is delicious.  Don't use too much lemon. I always have Tilapia in my freezer and it is so healthy and tasty.

It seemed a bit bland to me as well. I made it again a few days ago, though, and broiled the fish with just a bit of cooking spray and a sprinkle of salt & pepper, and made up a sauce separately by browning a little bit of onion in a touch of butter/EVOO, then adding garlic, some capers, and lemon zest, deglazing with lemon juice, then stirring in butter off the heat to keep the sauce creamy. There was quite a lot of butter used, but since everyone could sauce their own fish, they were in control of how much they had, and it really only needed a touch for a big burst of flavor.  Yeah, now that I look at it, that's practically a new recipe. That seems to happen sometimes! lol.

Simple, quick, inexpensive, and easy meal. I sauteed the lemon, garlic, butter, and parsley first as others have suggested. Also used more garlic and butter. TIP: do not cook the garlic while sauteing. They ended up getting burnt when I poured the sauce over the fish for baking. Also, the lemon and butter will evaporate while sauteing so you will need to make more of it to ensure that every part of the fillet gets the flavor. Served with angel hair pasta and aparagus. MMmm

Very good! Will use this recipe over and over. I did not use Parsley because our family isn't a huge fan of the herb. I did use garlic powder instead of fresh cloves; I also used bottled lemon juice. Added Lemon & Pepper seasoning salt prior to baking. I hate "fishy" tasting fish and this was wonderful.

I made this tonight using olive oil instead of butter, and I only had 3 tilapia fillets. Still, my husband and I both thought it had very little flavor (and I went heavy on the garlic). Not a keeper.

I made this last night and it was great!  Talk about no effort healthful cooking.  My fillets were a little small so I made five instead of four, and I added a bit more butter and half a lemon's worth of juice.  We bought a big bag of individually packed fillets, which were easy to defrost in the sink with some lukewarm water (still in the bags).  Now that I know how easy it can be, I will probably use frozen fish all the time.  When you live away from the coasts (Iowa in my case), frozen is the way to go.  Also, my boyfriend thought they needed a touch of salt, so next time I will add that.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! This is the best recipe I've ever had for tilapia. I used about 3x as much garlic as listed and Italian Herbs because I was out of parsely. Delicious and very flexible!

All I can say is, "WOW." This is so simple yet so tasty. I don't like a strong lemon taste in my fish so I just used less lemon juice and since I'm watching my fat/calorie intake I only put a pat of butter in. Also, I pan fried/braised the fillets in a little olive oil in a pan (the oven was occupied with a cake I was baking) then added the butter right at the end so it wouldn't burn. The fish didn't crisp at all and instead became a tender melt-in-your-mouth texture. The husband practically swallowed his fillet whole!

I have never been a fan of tilapia, but I love this recipe. Great way to take out the overpowering "fishy" taste. I made two alterations, the first I let the fish soak in the lemon juice for 15 min. Also, I placed the tilapia in the oven for 10-15 minutes @ 400 degrees. Not too dry nor soft.

This recipe was good.  I increased the garlic by 4x.  I also sauted the garlic in the butter and lemon juice before putting on the fish.  My cooking time was much less than 30 mins, more like 15-20.  Keep an eye on your fish so you don't overcook it.

Very good if you like the tilapia to really stand out but for us it was a little bland after weekly making the Broiled Tilapia Parmesan. My favorite way to eat fish yet.

So simple and so delicious.  The fact that it's also healthy makes this recipe a favorite in our house.  The most important thing is to get good tilapia.  I've tried a few frozen brands and find the one Costco carries to be the best tasting.

This is really simple and really easy. I eyeballed the measurements down to one serving and found that it didn't need the full 30 minutes. I also followed the advice of others and sauteed the garlic first, then mixing in the rest of the sauce ingredients.

Awesome. This recipe is so easy and it turned out terrific. I did saute the garlic in butter first, then added the parsley and lemon juice. Poured it all over the tilapia and baked for about 10 minutes. The fish was so flavorful and moist. Whole family loved it. Even my non-fish-eating daughter is asking when we can have it again.

This was quick and easy. So delicious, too! I love the classic flavor combination.   I too sauteed my garlic with the butter and lemon juice. Otherwise I think the garlic tasted a little raw/overpowering.

This was just OK for us; think to better suit our taste it could have used less lemon, more butter and for sure salt.  Baking time is too long, my filets were about 1/2 inch at the thickest part and they were done in less than 20 minutes.  I would suggest to check at about 15 minutes.

Excellent with adjustments.  I followed a lot of reviewers' advice: Preheat oven to 400.  Mince up 2 cloves of garlic, squeeze 2-3 tbs of lemon juice, 3-4 tbs of butter melted, and some ritz crackers made into crumbs. A little salt and pepper on the tilapia.  Sprinkle on the garlic, then lemon juice, then butter.  Finish with the cracker crumbs. Put in oven for about 12 minutes and it's finished.  Tastes great and even the kids like it!

Recommendation: bake this with asparagus, it gets even better! Just take raw asparagus, half each one lengthwise, and put them between and around the tilapia in the baking dish- making sure they are at least partially submerged in the sauce. They turn out juicy and delicious, and complement the tilapia well!

Hit with the kids and adults. Used Basa fillets instead of tilapia. Baked for approx 18-20 min, and the fillets were quite thick. Used more garlic. Excellent recipe. Can't wait to try it with other fish.

This is a very simple and good recipe, I wrapped the fish in foil and added bok choy, mushrooms and a couple of cherry tomatoes on top. I change the veggies to what ever I have at the time I cook the fish.

I think I'll be making my tilapia this way quite often. I followed the basic recipe for 2 fillets but used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1 (I love garlic), and used a previous reviewers suggestion to saute the garlic, lemon juice, and parsley in the butter before adding to the fish. I also added salt and pepper to the fish before drizzling on the butter/lemon juice/etc mix. Next time I think I will try adding 2 tbsp lemon juice instead of 3. Deeelicious.

I used some of the suggestions posted, I sauteed the garlic, lemon, italian seasonings, & butter and I also added salt & pepper. Even with these changes, I thought the fish was really bland. The texture was a little off to, I cooked the fish at 400 F for about 25 minutes & still felt more like poached rather than baked fish. I don't think I would make this again as is.

this is an ok recipe. i made a lot of changes to it. first, i made a rub of olive oil, salt and pepper. i marinated the fish in this for 1/2 an hour. then, i sauteed 2 cloves of garlic in 1tbsp of butter. i added more butter, lemon juice, and fresh chopped parsley. this was the sauce. i poured it over the fish and baked at 350 degrees F for about 15 minutes. without these changes, it would be 3.5 stars. with them, its truly delicious

I am giving this 5 stars for the idea of this recipe!  I rarely ever change the orginal receipe but based on other reviews I did.  I used  5 cloves of garlic and sauted the garlic, parsley, lemon.  I added some cajun spice mix to the tilapia (from this site) put it in a baking dish than put the butter/garlic sauce over the fish and baked.  It was so good.  Like I said, I really changed the receipe but it was so worth it.

I made this tilapia tonight for dinner and I did as alot of others had mentioned.  I sauteed 3 T garlic, 3 T butter, and I used the juice of 1 lemon, and poured over my fillets.  I baked at 400 for about 10-12 minutes.  Wonderful, fresh way to get my DH to eat more fish.  We both loved it.

OMG! I can't believe how easy & flavorful this recipe is. I did modify it a bit by seasoning the fish with old bay, garlic salt and garlic pepper (we're garlic lovers). I then sauteed FRESH garlic in butter AND olive oil, squeezed lemon juice into the mixture and added FRESH parsley. I poured this mixture over the seasoned fish and bake d. So so good. This recipe has become a regular in my house.

This recipe was great!!!!  So light and healthy, and incredibly easy to make.  My father caught some striped bass, so I made it with the freshly caught fish.  Even my nephews liked it!!!!  They both took seconds!!!

Excellent, easy and cheap recipe! I followed some suggestions in order to make in pure perfection! I cooked it at 400 degrees for 11 minutes, i put pepper, salt, and butter on one side and parsley on the other, and I put the tilapia (butter-side down) on aluminum foil and folded it closed around the fish so that the fish really absorbed the seasonings while cooking. I also added parmesian cheese to the top after 5 minutes of cooking. Served with a side of yellow rice = YUMM!!!

this was a very easy dinner. i think next time i will half the lemon juice and sub w/ some white wine. hubby said he felt like he was biting into a lemon. i used half butter and half olive oil and it worked really well. mine was done after 25 mins but they were pretty nice sized fillets. i think if they were the paper thin ones they probably would have been overcooked. served w/ jasmine rice and steamed green beans for a quick and easy dinner.

Great taste and not too rich!  "MommyFromSeattle" is right: it is better to saute the garlic in butter.  Another review recommended to cook at a higher temperature for a shorter amount of time: I recommend 400 for 17 minutes to allow for that golden brown color.  If you reduce the salt, this is great served with Tony Cacheres Creole seasoning.  I made this with the Garlic Parmesian Angel Hair Pasta and some veggies and it made for a tasty, inexpensive meal!

Delicious I followed the recommendations.. adding 2-3 Tablespoons of bread crumbs and seasoning the tilapia with salt, pepper and chili powder. Also adding extra garlic.

Very light. Great for a quick meal. If I were to make this again, I would add the parsley after the fish is cooked. I like the freshness of parsley. I had trouble "sprinkling" my garlic that I pressed through a garlic press. I got chunks of garlic over the fish. I would do what others recommend to saute the butter and garlic. Served with asparagus and a wild rice pilaf.

I really enjoyed this recipe, although my husband did not.  I thought it was just as described - healthy and light.  My husband didn't think it was substantial enough...he was still hungry after three pieces.  But, if you're looking for a light fish recipe, this is a good one!

It was pretty good.  My first time trying tilapia.  I found it a bit bland.  Next time I'll use more garlic and some different, fresh herbs and less oil (I used olive oil instead of butter).

Very good and simple recipe. I combined all the ingredients in a small bowl and then placed in the microwave for about 30 seconds or so, mixed well and then poured the mixture over the fish and baked as directed. Delish!

I used extra garlic - this was good and I'll make it again, but I guess I'm not a big fan of lemon. My BF loved it (I cooked 6 filets and he ate 2-1/2 of them) and my 13 year old son has already requested that I make it again. My 11 year old son and I thought it was "okay" but not great.

Delicious! But I did alter the recipe based on some of the recommendations. I sauted lots of fresh garlic, 4 tablespoons butter, and 2 tablespoons lemon juice.  I added the sauce to the tilapia after baking it for 10 minutes. Can't wait to make it again!

I really liked how easy this recipe was, but I added about 1/2 a cup of chardonnay which I though tasted AMAZING with this recipe.

There are far better Tilapia recipes out there.  This one was a bit disappointing.  Lacked flavor overall.  Try the broiled parmesan Tilapia or the coconut breaded Tilapia with aprocot dipping sauce.  Much better.

I was a little skeptical about this recipe because we always eat our fish breaded.  It was the best fish I've had in a while.  My husband just had to have another piece.  
I seasoned the fish individually with garlic salt and powder, dipped it in butter and I sprinkled lemon juice and pepper before baking it.  I served it with buttered garlic boiled potatoes and buttered corn.  It was a great meal and it took me 45 minutes to put together.

This recipe is GREAT and so easy.  I added some red pepper to give it some more flavor, but it doesn't need much.  Real handy for those times when you forget to prepare for dinner for it comes right from the freezer.  I cook it for 20 min. at 350.

Awesome! I tried a couple of variations, cooked 12 minutes at 400 Fahrenheit, sauteed the garlic in the butter, added garlic powder and cayenne pepper (just a dash of cayenne...a lot of garlic powder). Served with a spicy mustard dipping sauce (which was totally unnecessary but looked nice on the plate) and roasted garlic potatoes. Delectable! I will do this regularly and in a larger setting for friends and family. I think I will also try it with collared or mustard greens and basmati rice.

Made some modifications according to other cooks' comments, but will not make this again since I found it rather boring.  There are too many things to do with tilapia that are more flavorful, though this is very, very easy indeed!

Fantastic!  I changed it up slightly to make it healthier. Instead of butter I used smart balance.  I also used an indoor grill to cook the fish using Pam.  I sauteed the other ingredients in another pan and then poured the sauteed lemon/garlic/butter/parsly mixture on top of the grilled fish and let it sit in the juices for about 2 minutes.  The fish came out grilled and flakey and the taste was excellent! I will use this recipe again and again.

This is a really good, healthy recipe for tilapia. I used olive oil instead of butter to make it a little more healthy and it turned out delicious!

I've had this 4 days in a row. As you guess that means I love this, but I use basil instead of parsley. I also use minced garlic from my pantry rather than chopped fresh garlic. Another thing I used was lemon juice from a bottle. Don't put it in for more than 8 minutes on 375 F. If you do over cook it, it's still really good. The first time I made it, I cooked it all 30 minutes and the really was no taste but it still had a great inside texture and flavor. My grandpa tried it today and said it was amazing.

I loved this recipe for tilapia!  I only cooked it in the over at 400 degrees for 10 minutes from reading some of the reviews, and it was PERFECT - very tender, it fell apart with a fork.  My husband and I absolutely loved it.  The only thing I would have changed, that I regret not doing before, was to use more butter and less lemon juice.  You could taste a bit of the lemon juice in every bite.  Still, it was delicious!

It was so moist and delicious. Definitely will make again. Followed some suggestions and sauteed the garlic,lemon, and parsley flakes..i actually used limes because i didn't have lemons and greased my pan with butter...came out delicious...put salt and pepper on the bottom of the tilapia..and on the top i put tony's creole seasoning..then i poured the butter and everything on top with a little bit of parmesan..and baked for 20 minutes...came out beautiful!!

My husband and I loved it and my kids were, "OK" which is good for them with fish. I did alter it a bit but not much. I omitted the parsley and baked with a couple jalapeno slices on each filet and a bit of the juice - they were pickled slices (just remove before serving if you're not into spice). Also I always soak in milk overnight to reduce fishiness.

This was not my husband or my favorite, but tilapia is not our favorite fish either. This was just a little bit plain, and not much flavor for us. It was not bad, but we didn't think it was great either. This was quick and easy (which is great), but mediocre in taste.

Okay.. well I didn't bake it because I was HUNGRY and didn't want to wait for preheat.  I melted the butter, added the fish and other ing. except the lemon.  Added lemon last few minutes of cooking.  Done.. fast and easy recipe and GOOD!  Very light tasting eventhough cooked in butter.  Keeper

This one wasn't that great at all.  The fish taste was very distinct.  Second time I didn't use tilapia because it's such a strong tasting fish, and it still wasn't that great.  Sorry.

Oh my! This came as a surprise. Never thought such simple ingredients could make such a fabulous light healthy meal. Tastes great! Would recommend putting more lemon if you like that tangy taste! I used garlic salt instead of garlic for a little bolder flavor. PERFECT, the whole family loved it thoroughly and we will be using this recipe over and over again.

This was very good.  I used my George Foreman grill and used a little Old Bay Seasoning and Lemon Pepper as well.

I mixed a bit of olive oil in with the butter and added some dried onion powder, red pepper, paprika, and seasoned sea salt.

This is the tilapia recipe I use regularly!  Feel free to make it your own (i.e., add Emeril's essence, finely chopped gingerroot, crushed breadcrumbs or cracker crumbs, etc.).  It's very versatile.   I strongly suggest omitting the garlic when serving this dish for company or people with queasy stomachs because the garlic turns green and has a moldy appearance.  I haven't tried but just realized that perhaps sauteing the garlic beforehand might solve this problem?

Easy, but bland.  Garlic powder would probably give more flavor than fresh garlic.  Definitely needs salt and pepper.

Lacked a bit of flavor, but that could be my fault cause I seasoned lightly. Otherwise very easy and delicious.

We did not eat fish very often until we tried this recipe. Now we eat this once a week. It is delicious! Note we are not parsley fans so we just omit that and do add more cayenne pepper to give it a kick.

This is so easy to make! I just chopped the butter and sprinkled that on top of the fillets. I didn't have parsley so I just replaced with Oregano. That worked too and the fish was flavorful.

Delicious way to prepare any white fish.  Really fast, but very delicious!  I added a little dill weed with the parsley flakes for that little bit of zest.

Excellent recipe .. a new favorite.   I also added a touch of dill (per one of the other reviews) and served with chopped tomato, cucumber, sweet onion salad (3 parts extra virgin olive oil to 1 part lemon juice + seasoning) ... it was GREAT!

Very delicious recipe and a great "Base" recipe. You can switch it up a bit and it will likely still be delicious. I stuck lemon juice, butter, garlic cloves, fresh dill and a pinch of cayenne pepper and sea salt in a little blender. I spread this mix on my fillets and followed the cooking instructions (375 for about 25min).. They were mighty tasty. Thank you for providing a starter recipe that one can expand on! Yum!

I made a few changes buy it turned out great. I took a large bowl mixed fresh lemon juice, basil(instead of parsley), fresh garlic, 2 tbs butter, and cooked it for 2 min in microwave string several times. THEN took a piece of foil about 10x12 placed a handful of fresh spinach in the center dipped tilapia in mixture placed it on top of the spinach put 2 tbs of mixture over the fish folded the foil like a pouch and placed it on a cookie sheet. It turned out so good my family wants it once a week. Well at least till they get tired of that too.

I used whiting because that's what I had in the freezer, lemon pepper seasoning because I didn't have any lemon juice, and sprinkled parmesan cheese on top and it turned out pretty darn good! My fiance is VERY picky about fish and even he liked it!

Awesome! One of my favorites to fix on a weekday, brakes with the routine and adds a beachy feeling to your week, paired with some white rice, steamed veggies and a couple of Heineken's, loved the simplicity of it yet the abundance of rich flavors brought up by the lemon and garlic, yum!!! Thank you for sharing!

My husband even liked this one, and he's not a big fish fan, so that's a plus! I think there might have been a little too much parsley and might use garlic pepper next time instead of just regular pepper (because I love garlic). Otherwise, very easy to make and very good!

Great Recipe!!! But, I broiled the Tilapia instead of baking it.  The tastes and flavors were excellent. I placed two nice size filets on aluminum foil and put under the brolier for 6 minutes each side. The result was flaky and tasty.  I doctored the ingredients and used EVOO instead of butter. I also used more lemon juice. I used 6 garlic cloves, sauteed in 1 tablespoon of EVOO and poured over fish. I marinated the fish in the lemon juice for 2hrs in the refrigerator.  I put parsley, garlic powder, black pepper and tony's crackers cajun seasoning on top (not too much). Lastly I put the sauteed garlic and remaining EVOO on top and marinated it. 
I c/n imagine how it would taste baked, so I broiled it. Definitely a winner!!!

Easy peasy and very good!  This is seriously one if the easiest/quickest prep-time main dishes ever.  Have not tweaked the recipe.  It's good just as the recipe is originally written.  I use the pre-diced jars of garlic for all my recipes because I'm lazy.

OMG this was the best fish I ever cooked! I did add salt and pepper to the fish before adding the lemon and the butter - and I did press the garlic and rubbed it on the fish - and cooked it at 375 for like 30 minutes (my stove is old...) this was so tasty. I was so proud of myself! and the boyfriend loved it too! thank you !!!

I liked these.  I usually dredge mine and cook them on the stovetop in butter and when they're done I take them out of the pan and do the sauce right in the pan.  But I liked this method, as there is less butter involved.  Also, as per some of the reviews, I sprinkled chili powder and parmesan on top of the fish.  I will make this again.

I was extremely impressed with this recipe. Even my mother loved it and she HATES garlic! Very quick and easy to prepare and it came out delicious. I'm pregnant and I'm trying to incorporate more low-mercury level fish into my diet. I am definitely saving this recipe and will be cooking it again! Yum!

This is a good and easy recipe. I seperate the fillets after coating in the sauce and place them in foil packets and cook them on low  the BBQ  about 10 minutes each side,so the house doesn't smell like fish.

One of my favorite fish recipes!  Great taste.  If you don't want it to taste too lemony make sure that you use more butter than lemon juice.

This was pretty good and I'm not a fan of fish. I did add more lemon juice to the fish once it was on my plate. served it with couscous and broccoli. Very easy to make, a great weeknight meal.

Awesome recipe. I agree with previous reviewers about the baking time, though. Mine was done in about 15 minutes; 30 minutes would have been way too long. 

Love the lemon and garlic flavor in this recipe, but I'll add a little salt next time.

Recipe was good. I made it better by saute'ing some baby portabello musrooms in butter and garlic and spooning them over the tilapia befor serving. Fantastic!! Serve with a bottle of Cupcake Chardonay.

I made this for supper tonight and my son and I thought it was a great recipe. I did like the others suggested and sauteed the garlic with the lemon juice, parsley and butter then poured it over the fish before baking it. I did not bake it for 30 minutes, only 15-20 minutes with sprinkling parm cheese over it for the last 5 minutes or so. Very good!!

I really like this simple recipe for fish, and so does my husband.  Can't beat lemon, butter, and garlic, although I always increase the garlic because we like it a lot.

This was my first attempt at making tilapia and I liked the fact that it was an easy recipe to follow. I had to cook it a little longer than stated and thought the lemon taste was a bit overpowering, but overall it was a good recipe.

wow, my first ever fish endeavor and it was fantastic! i used the written ingredients with 5 filets, and only cooked for 10min on 400. i did let them sit covered for a while before eating so they probably cooked a little more in the pan. i am impressed and so is hubby :)

Very delicious, and this is coming from a non-fish eater. I used 2 halibut fillets weighing .5 lbs (I chose halibut over tilapia after reading that tilapia may actually be bad for you). I microwaved 3 cloves of garlic with 2 tbs butter. I cut the lemon juice down to 1.5 tbs. The garlic flavor was a little intense, so next time I'll only use 1/2 clove of garlic per fillet and I'll saute it first.

I used this recipe to base my fish on, however...I greased the baking sheet with olive oil, used swai fillet, drizzled the lemon juice and added Cavender's All Purpose Greek Seasoning (my favorite seasoning).  Delicious!

I did not have the garlic cloves or dried parsley but I do have some garlic salt and parsley season I used that along with the ingredients and added some old bay and pepper it was yummie.  I added lemon pepper green beans and brown rice.  My husband just ate and did not talk have not seen that in awhile.  Thanks for sharing this, I will defintely make again.

Ok, but needs some work as it's a bit to lemony & a touch bland.
Cooking time should be 15-18min @ 400 depending on thickness of filets.
Wrapping each in foil is not a bad idea.
My Sauce would be 2T butter, 2T lemon juice, 1T garlic powder, 1.5t parsley flake.
Coat fish more heavily w/ Old Bay

Best tilapia recipe I've ever tried. Easy too. I just mixed all the ingredients (except the tilapia) and poured over the fish. From now on...this is how I prepare tilapia.

I really liked this. Perfect flavor. I used olive oil instead of butter and marinated it for a half hr. I also used fresh lemon juice. Put it in the toaster oven at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. Really tasty.

This was ok.  Not being an experienced fish cooker - I had a hard time determining if the fish was done.  I ended up cooking it about 35 mins. just to be sure.

I made this last night and was very surprised at how good it was.  I usually use bread crumbs on my tilapia, but this is a great alternative.  I did mix the lemon juice, butter, garlic, and parsley in a small skillet over low heat and drizzled over the tilapia, then sprinkled just a little bit of parmesan cheese on top.  My 7 yr old son LOVED it!

Five starts for ease of preparation and excellent flavor.  I was really pressed for time so I took some short-cuts - I dotted the butter on the fish instead of melting it. I also added about a teaspoon of jarred chopped garlic on top - I didn't bother to saute it as someone had suggested.  A added a dash of salt, the dried parsley, and a generous amount of pepper on top, followed by a squeeze of half a lemon (I'm sure this was less than 3 tbs but this amount was fine) - the results were fabulous!  I cooked it for 20 minutes at 400 degrees. Served with brown rice and roasted asparagus - the whole meal took 30 minutes.  Eat your heart out, Rachel Ray...

I made this almost exactly as directed by the recipe.  The only changes I made were cranking the oven up to 400 and only cooking for 20 minutes.  My husband and I loved them!  They were light and delicious.

Easy, easy fish recipe. I would cut the lemon juice back a bit next time. I love lemon, but it was a little overpowering. Garlic was delicious on the fish.

This was excellent. I did add a few bread crumbs before I drizzled on the butter and a sprinkle of dill(only because my 6 year old doesn't care for "naked fish"-yes-it's all in her head!). 

Like other reviews mine didn't need 30 minutes-about 15 minutes of cooking and a couple minutes under the broiler to crisp up the crumbs.

Huge hit all around-the kiddo had 3 servings and even ate her broccoli enthusiastically so she could have more fish.

Great basic recipe.  Based on "most helpful" reviews, I added a little more garlic / substituted half olive oil with the butter / topped with buttered Panko and cooked at 400 for 15 minutes.  Next time going to add capers and possibly some calamata olives.  You really can tailor this with many different flavors without overpowering the tilapia.

So funny that this is the recipe of the day today because I found it yesterday and made it last night!  Everyone here really liked it.  It's simple and quick but tastes great.  Watch carefully, though, it doesn't take 30 min to bake.  Our fillets were frozen and it was more like 15 min.  I'll make this regularly.

Loved this recipe! My fillets only took 15 minutes. I also substituted italian seasoning for the parsley flakes because I had none! Garnish with half a lemon and it's a beautiful presentation.

Tasty recipe! I followed the suggestions to: cook the garlic first before putting it on the fish, cook the individual pieces in foil, and I also added salt and pepper.  My only problem is I should have used a bit more salt and pepper and I had to immediately brush my teeth after eating, but that was an operator error not the recipe!

Great simple recipe. I did use roasted garlic and added  a sprinkle of parmesan cheese in the last 5 minutes of baking. Mine was done in 15-20 as Tilapia is a thin fish. I cant wait to try this recipe with salmon. Family was asking for more!!!!

The preferred method for cooking tilapia in my home now! Definitely saute the garlic first! I sprinkled a small amount of lemon-pepper seasoning over the filets also and they were fabulous! Even with giant filets, I only needed to cook for 15 minutes at 400 degrees.

read the reviews before making this. it took about 15 minutes for it to become flaky in the oven. also added red pepper flakes after reading a review. i think they added just enough kick. will probably use more butter next time (i just eye balled the ingredients so i may have shorted it in the first place). bottom line: it was delicious. very quick. very easy. minimal ingredients. had it alongside broccoli w/ roasted red peppers which was a great compliment to to the dish. will definitely use this recipe again!

Came out  fantastic, great flavor and texture!  Alterations: I had to use garlic powder (ran out of fresh garlic and didn't even realize it!), which I did saute with the lemon juice, parsley flakes, pepper, and butter before pouring it over the fillets (as per others' reviews).  This is an inexpensive, wonderful, easy-to-use recipe.  Love it!

Just the right amount of flavor.  I may have cooked it a few minutes too long, about 20, so I definitely think I could have taken it out at about 10-15.  I also forgot to put the pepper on until it was about half-way through baking, and put way too much, but other than that it was perfect!  I did what others suggested about sauteing the butter, lemon juice, garlic, and parsley first, and that was lovely.  Overall, very simple and very yummy!  Will make it again!

I really like this mostly because of the garlic! I sautee the garlic for a few minutes with the parsley, then put on the tilapia. Of course, the lemon is a very nice touch. Served with quinoa. Very Great!

Just added this recipe to our bi-weekly rotation! It was great, somewhat healthy and super fast if you don;t have a lot of time on your hands.   I followed previous reviews, and increased butter to 3 TBS, used 2 TBS of lemon and 3 garlic cloves. 375 F for 12 minutes was more than enough. I also set broil for the last minute for a bit of browning.  Awesome recipe.... weekly dinner material for sure!

Very good. I marinated some artichokes in garlic and olive oil, salt and pepper (just an hour) and threw them over the fish. About 5 half chokes per fillet.  Served with brown rice cooked in chicken broth with a little "butter."

I used this recipe for fresh turbot instead of tilapia.  It was great!  Simple ingredients, wonderful flavor.  It didn't overpower the delicious fish, but it was just enough to add something special to it.  I can see this being great on just about any type of white fish, really.  My husband claimed it was "some of the best" he'd ever eaten.

Very good!  Probably the best fish recipe I have had and super easy to make!  I did make a couple of changes to it because it is what I had on hand but as written I think it would be very good also.  I put the butter, lemon and garlic in one bowl and mixed together.  I sprinkled some cajun seasoning and lemon pepper seasoning over the fish and poured the butter mixture on top and baked for 15 minutes.  We will definitely be making this again and again!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I followed the recipe above, except that I put salt and pepper on the fillets after I pat them dry, squeezed half a lemon over the fillets, and sauteed the minced garlic with the butter before I drizzled it over the fillets. Then I put the fillets into the oven at 375 for 15 minutes before I read from a few reviewers to cook it at a higher heat. So I raised the temp to 400 and cooked it until they were flaking. Then I seared the fillets in a hot pan with the butter and juices from the baking dish. The fillets stuck a little to our pan (we have horrible cooking supplies!) but the tilapia was DELISH!! I added a little salt at the end, served them with some long grain rice-a-roni (lazy!), went well together!

This was the easiest recipe for fish I've used, and maybe the most delicious.  I also substituted olive oil for the butter, and sauteed in my electric skillet.  This fish looked even better than the photo!

Thought the very simple ingredients would leave this fish bland...but it was excellent!  Put a lot more garlic, added salt & pepper, used butter and EVO, & sprinkled some ritz crackers on top.  Cooked 4 fillets for 12 min at 400.  To die for!!!!!!!!

I love it when a simple dish has a lot of flavor. I liked this recipe a lot. The only thing different I did was the addition of capers, and slightly more garlic. The sauce left in the pan was awesome.

Great fish recipe. I replaced the butter with evoo and used garlic pdr instead of fresh. I also sprinkled some cajun seasoning on top. Great lemony spicy mix!

Fabulous recipe!  I followed the recommendations in the reviews and sauteed the garlic in the butter and lemon juice. I used 3tbs butter, 2 tbs lemon juice and 3 cloves of garlic.  Left it for 25mins as the fish was cold to start with but after eating I realise I could have taken it out a little earlier.  Still tasted great though!

My husband and I really loved this! We also cooked in wrapped in foil, our pieces were thick so I cooked it at 400 for 15 min. I also increased the garlic as recommended and used sea salt and pepper on the fish as well

Quick and easy but lacking some flavor. Next time I think I will add lemon pepper, add lots of sliced garlic & butter. Drizzle with lemon juice afterwards.

Delicious! I used "I can't believe it's not butter" spray instead of the 1 tbsp of melted butter to eliminate that extra bit of fat. Yum!

This fish is delicious! I love baked fish and this is my new recipe for tilapia. I sauteed 4 garlic cloves in olive oil and put extra olive oil in my baking dish, lightly seasoned the fish with salt and pepper. Then added small amount of lemon juice, parsley and drizzled the garlic and oil. I covered it to seal in the flavor. My children even loved it and they can be picky when it comes to fish.

This is wonderful.  It is simple, inexpensive, and delicious.  The fish comes out moist and infused with flavor.  We will reuse this recipe many times in the future, and it seems like it will allow for modifications for different herbs and flavors.

This was very easy to make, quick to put together. My whole family loved it, though my husband commented that I should let the fish marinade a bit so the fish has flavor all the way through rather than just the outside. I served it with Jasmine rice and lightly sauced pasta and it was a great meal.

The first time I made this, I had large fillets and not enough butter/lemon mixture. It didn't taste good at all. I remade this today because the number of reviews was so high and I wanted to make a good tilapia dish. I am so glad I did. It was delicious. I had 2 large tilapia fillets (a little over 8 ounces each), which I cut into 4 pieces. I took the recommendation of other reviewers and wanted to use 4 tbsp butter/2 tbsp lemon juice/3 cloves of garlic... but I was worried about the butter content in this recipe, so I used 2 tbsp butter with 2 tbsp EVOO instead. I put kosher salt and black pepper on each fillet and place onto baking dish, followed by lemon juice. I sauteed the garlic in the butter/EVOO mixture and pour it onto the fillets. Instead of parsley (DH and I don't like the taste), I used basil and thyme. 30 minutes is definitely too long. I overcooked it and it was only in the oven for 20 minutes. Next time I will only cook for 15 min. Great recipe. Definitely a keeper.

I made 2 lbs. tilapia (10 fillets). I doubled all the other ingredients, mixed them together, and added about 1 Tbs. olive oil, 1/2 tsp. salt and a dash of ground red pepper. I dipped the tilapia in the mixture to coat both sides, and baked on a foil-lined cookie sheet sprayed w/Pam at 375 for 18 minutes. The fish was perfectly done and flakey. I agree that 30 minutes is probably way too long.

Very good recipe.  I needed something quick for dinner and this was easy and tasty.  The 30 min. baking time was much too long.  I baked it for 20 min. and it was falling apart.  I added some Cajun seasoning and extra garlic for extra flavor.  Thanks for a good, quick recipe.

Delicious and simple. I stuck to the recipe as it is written except for one thing.  I used a pinch of Old Bay Garlic and Herb seasoning instead of pepper and salt.  My fish was done at 25 minutes so don't wait for 30 minutes before checking doneness.

I am not a fan of fish and decided I wanted to start eating more healthy.  I tried this recipe and was very impressed.  I did use some of the allterations listed by others such as cooked in the foil, added the cajun seasoning and sauteed the garlic and lemon juice in the butter.

My husband and I both liked this very much. How could you not with butter, lemon, and garlic! A good and easy staple we can add into our cooking routine. I think it is a great base to expand on flavors as well.

The recipe itself was good.  We've never had Tilapia before and didn't like the taste of this particular fish, but that has nothing to do with the recipe.

I took the advice of another reviewer and sauted the garlic, lemon juice, butter,and parsley before baking. I turned the heat up to 400 and baked 15 minutes. I added some salt and lemon pepper. Perfection. My husband does not eat baked fish, but he ate 2 fillets!!! adding to our weekly menu. thank for the great recipie!

Made this last night following other reviewers suggestion of melting the butter with the garlic and lemon juice. Didn't have parsley so I used dill. I also lemon peppered the fillets before adding the butter lemon sauce. Only baked for 12 minutes for 4 fillets.

This was great, but I only cooked it for 15minutes. I think 30mins would have been way to long. I added some Old Bay & red pepper flake to suit our tastes better.

Made this tonight with fresh parsley and three cloves of garlic.  I liked it - it wasn't the best ever - but it was good and it was easy and quick - and my kids ate it without making any sort of face!  So - it's good for me!

Simple and delicious.  I took couple advises from other reviewers.  I marinated 1 hour before baking.  I used 1 table spoon of butter and 1 table spoon of lemon juice.  I cooked the garlic with butter first also.  Thank you for the recipe.

WOW! This was AMAZING. I did alter the original recipe. I used dill instead of parsley, and added some red pepper flakes, also put them in foil pockets as one reviewer said. Defiantly a must try!

I also sauteed the garlic in the butter and lemon in a pan & then became pinched for time, so & added 1/4 cup of white wine & just placed the tilapia fillets in the pan! I sprinkled them with parsley & let them simmer for no more than 10 minutes & they turned out so good! The fillets were thin so I didn't want to mess with flipping them & just spooned the sauce on them & covered. My guests said it was better than a restaurant & asked for more of the sauce over everything. So easy without putting on the oven or the grill & very moist. Rice & a fresh spinach salad complemented well. I've already made this twice & it just can't get any easier!

Holy garlic! I was really excited for this recipe - just a few simple, classic ingredients to highlight the fish- but the garlic was the only real flavor we got out of the dish. My suggestion is to either axe it entirely or saute the garlic first, so it isn't so so sharp. I also found that 30 minutes in the oven would have been way too long, I baked mine for 18 minutes and it was perfectly cooked.

I don't give out 5 stars very often, but this was delicious and so easy! I didn't have fresh lemons, so used reconstituted lemon juice (but can't wait to try it with fresh lemon juice). Also, used garlic salt with parsley in it instead of the garlic powder and parsley.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a big hit for everyone.  I can't believe how easy it is to make and yet so delicious.  I was glad that I read the reviews before cooking it because sauteing the butter, garlic, parsley, and lemon juice before pouring  it to the fish made such a difference.  I also added lemon rind to my butter mixture because I really like a lemony butter sauce.  I love the sauce so much that I used the same pan to cook my peas.  It gave my peas so much flavor and it brought the dish together.  Perfect dinner for us.

I made this for my fiance and we both thought this was amazing! Neither one of us is a big fish lover, but the fish turned out so tasty. I omitted the parsley and used fresh dill instead which added a nice bit of flavor. I agree with previous posters about the cook time. I cooked it for 25 mins at 375 and the fatter side of the fillet was very juicy but the thin side was dry. Next time I will cut the cook time down.

My kids love this recipe... I used lime jucie instead of lemon.It was what I had. I didn't defrost my fish. I put the frozen fish into the pan and follow the directions. I did add salt about 1/8 of a teaspoon along with peper. It baked at 350 in 30 minutes.

Great easy recipe.  I used half butter and half olive oil and it tasted fantastic.  My filets were done in 20 minutes.  Depending on the the thickness of your fish, you may not need to cook for the full 30 minutes.

I tried this the other day. It was very good. I sauteed the parsely, garlic, and lemon in the butter. I made extra. I put the tilapia in individually wrapped fiol paper. I made extra sauce to pour over the rice and more on the tilapia. It was very very delcious. I have made this more than once already. This recipe is a keeper!!! thank you so much!

Big hit!! Even for my picky eaters. My husband, who usually covers everything in a sauce, ate it without anything extra on top. This recipe will become a regular. Thanks for sharing it!

This really started me off with cooking, a nice basic recipe with so many opportunities for tweaking and branching out. Not to mention, it introduced me to the awesomeness of tilapia!

Cooking for two,both of us diabetic and trying to lose weight this was a five star meal.I used two tbsp of lemon juice and three cloves of garlic mixed with the melted butter plus one tsp of evoo. Fresh ground black pepper with two small sliced red skin potatoes and half a head of cauliflower and baked for 20 minutes made this a winner.

I used extra garlic and thought it turned out better for it.  I also cooked it at 400 for about 12 minutes and it turned out perfect.

My family LOVES Tilapia (our substitute for both Flounder fillets and Scallops, both of which are too expensive for us these days). I USED to egg batter and bread my fish fillets before either frying or baking them. But this recipe put an end to that! DELICIOUS as presented. But also REALLY good when braised  (in either vegetable or chicken broth) with recommended seasonings (plus a sprinkling of paprika) and adorned with slices of tomato. Served with a "green" (I usually use Spinach, but Kale or Escarole work well, too) and over rice or Cheesy Polenta (a recipe I found here on AllRecipes) and, in my opinion, this is a dinner that can be served to royalty!

i dont eat animals. So, I have a hard time knowing what taste good when people eat them. i just think of things i would like if i did eat them, and this sounded great. i made this for my husband, his parents and grandparents and they loved it!! like i had to make more that night. thank goodness it is a fast make. i also cooked in on 400 for about 15mins. i added a lil more butter to it as well. to make it super healthy i made steamed rice and steamed broccoli.

This was okay to us, but not exceptional.  I would add more butter or maybe olive oil next time.  I baked 20 minutes and it was too dry.  Definitely watch the time on this one.

This was really good and super simple. I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spreadable butter and spread that on both sides of the talapia. Added some fresh squeezed lemon juice and garlic. (No parsley on hand). Baked for 12 minutes at 350. Nice and flaky. Added some lima beans!

This was extremely easy to make and it was very tasty! I used fresh parsley instead of dried parsley and I think that made a difference. I also used catfish instead of tilapia, since I was in the mood for some catfish. I thought the cooking time was a bit long though. My fish came out a little dry, but I dressed it up with some of the sauce in the baking dish so it was okay. I would definitely make this again.

I changed this up a bit. For starters, I didn't bake it, I grilled it. I added more garlic and sprinkled Parmesan cheese on the top once it finished cooking. This was amazing! This will definitely be a keeper!

excellent and extremely easy to make! i microwave the butter, garlic and lemon juice until the butter is melted, then pour over tilapia. It is pretty much a weekly favorite along with roasted creamer potatoes and steamed broccoli.

Easy and so delicious!! I used the recipe's flavors but made it simpler: Brush melted butter over the fillets. Sprinkle generously with garlic powder and lemon pepper to taste, then bake at 400 degrees for 15 minutes. Serve atop jasmine rice and pan-fried asparagus (from Allrecipes) and - here's the good part - dash a few lines of SOY SAUCE over each plate before serving. It looked like it came from a restaurant and tasted like it, too.

A very good quick and easy fish recipe for a worknight.  I cut down a bit on the lemon juice but followed the recipe.  I used orange roughy for the fish.  Cooking time depends on the cut of fish so be careful. Will definitely make again.

Not crazy about fish to begin with but tried it due to health concerns. Followed the recipe to a "T" with the excption of using fresh parsley. Found it to be rather tastless and I wasn't nuts about the texture. Being a 'non-fish lover', I guess I need to continue using disguise-type recipes such as breading, sauces and batter.

This was not a big hit for us.I purchased fresh talapia which Ive cooked differant ways before, but this recipe was very fishy tasting and a bit bland and hard to swallow. The flavor of the lemon was not detected so we squeezed fresh lemon to try and enhance it. I usually try to give each recipe a second chance but I will pass on this one.

Was not impressed by this at all.  Sauteed the garlic with butter and olive oil as recommended and used extra garlic since I had more fish.  Still did not give any great flavor to the fish.  Very bland to me.  Sorry will not make again.

I tried this recipe, with making one change.  I sauted the garlic in the butter.  Then drizzled it on the fish.  I baked it for 10 minutes at 400 degrees.  And it was fabulous.  The taste was so good.  I will definely make this again.  It is so good and so quick.

Husband loved it - asked for more.  Really only takes minutes to prepare.  I changed one thing...I wrapped fish in foil and baked.  Poured fish and juices over steamed rice.  
I will make again and again!

I wish my husband liked fish so I could make this more often! I LOVED it! Lemon takes away the fishy taste and it is great served w/rice pilaf. Wouldn't change a thing! Will make again when husband is out of town ;)

Great quick recipe.  I saut√©ed the garlic as someone suggested.  I also added red pepper flakes (we like spicey food) and parmesan cheese. However, next time around I would omit the parmesan cheese - I didn't think it was necessary.

Very good taste! As some others suggested, I sauteed the ingrediants together and then drizzled over the fish. I also topped with some from parmesan cheese during the last 5 mins. Yummy!

Awesome recipe!  I prepared as other reviewers suggested - sauteed lots of garlic (in olive oil) and baked at 400.  I actually added less lemon juice as suggested but I think next time I make it I'll use more.  I love the lemony taste!

This was delicious, I did make a few changes.  Per a reviewers suggestion, I simmered garlic, butter (2 TBSP), lemon juice, parsley, and added some white wine.  Simmered for a few minutes until reduced some.  Poured over fish and baked for 13 minutes.  So good, I served it with a chopped salad and wild rice.  Wonderful!!  Thanks for the great starter recipe!

I have made this many many times and it has always turned out wonderfully! My daughter absolutely loved it which is saying something. The only changes I have made thus far is to add more minced garlic (we love garlic). I plan to fix this tomorrow but I think I will broil it instead of baking just for a change of pace. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

This was delicious. thank you for the tip on not to cook for 30 minutes. Mine was perfect in 13 minutes. I used basil instead of parsley, and sprinkled with parmesean cheese. Was Wonderful, I can't wait to try it with another type of fish.

I think if you add a little of vineger and leave it overnight you can take the fishie tast away and make it tast better. My fish tasted to fishi for me and my husband and we had to add alot of lime juice and papper to make it taste. But i will try again this recipe with my personal alterations.

We eat fish 2 - 3 times a week and this is a tasteful, easy and healthy recipe that will continue to work into our meal rotation.  I did saute the garlic, butter and lemon juice before pouring over fish, then sprinkled with parsley as suggested by others.  Thank you for sharing.

I thought it was rather bland and too lemony.  I followed the recommendations of a few reviewers and sauteed the garlic and parsley in butter and lemon juice, sprinkling the fish with chili powder before baking.  It just needed something more...maybe capers would add the extra kick.  Maybe bread crumbs in addition to the chili powder.  Very quick and easy, but kind of boring.

This was my first time cooking fish and it turned out wonderful.  I used lemon pepper seasoning instead of just plain pepper and it tasted sensational.  My husband loved it so much, he went back for seconds.  Will definitely use again.

Good, quick and easy.  I added some Old Bay and used the juice of 1/2 Meyer lemon (cut the recipe in half).  Instead of melting the butter, I just used a tiny little pat on each fillet.  I enjoyed this enough, but I don't think I'll be rushing to make it again.  My small fillets only took about half the time listed to cook.

Hm. I've never had tilapia before this, and I wasn't too impressed. The flavor was a bit odd; it definately needed something. I think it was too lemony as well.

Didn't care for this nor did my family. I guess we are to addicted to the crispy fried version of fish. I will keep trying healthier versions this just wasn't the right flavor for us.

My husband and I loved it! I seasoned it the night before so that when we came home from church, I wouldn't have that much to do. I also wanted the seasoning to really get in the fish, knowing that tilapia can be bland. I did like another review said and marinated the garlic in the butter before pouring it over the fish. Perhaps I had a large lemon, but it was almost too lemon-y. Next time I'll only use the juice of 1/2 lemon. Will surely make again...

Well...the flavour of the fish was very light and I added some seasoning that the recipe didn't call for.  I sprinkled the fish with homeade cajun seasoning first.  Then I added about 1 clove of garlic to each piece.  Drizzled with the lemon juice, then the butter and topped it with a sprinkling of lemon pepper (which contains salt).  The flavour was still very mild, but on the plus side the dish was very quick and easy to put together..excellent choice for a weeknight meal when time is tight.

This recipe was simple and delicious! I used fresh parsley instead of dried, because I happened to have it and butter flavor cooking spray in place of butter because we have a dairy allergy in our family. I'll definitely be making it again!

For as simple as this recipe was it was great!  I added some garlic salt and onion powder to add a little flavor and let the fish sit in everything for about 30 minutes as I waited for my husband to get home. I will definately fix this again as my husband asked for seconds!

Yummmmmm.  Excellent Tilapia.  Set the fillets on the grill and splashed on a little lemon juice.  Didn't have parsley, so substituted basil with a little oregano.  Mixed butter/garlic hers ahead of time, then brushed on after the juice. DELICIOUS.

Lemon flavor was a bit strong, so i would recommend either using less lemon juice or eating with rice (basmati) to help dim down the taste. Otherwise, very good, i loved it, and I'm only 14.

This recipe was just delicious. I also added the garlic to the butter as it was melting, so it could infuse the garlic flavor right into the butter. My company raved about this dish.

I tried this in foil on the grill which resulted in too much liquid and a soggy fish. Decent flavor though.

Excellent - and easy!  I cooked at 400 for about 15-20 minutes.  I had company and they were very impressed - especially for whipping it up on a Wednesday night!  Served it with a white bean salad (diced tomatoes, diced cucumbers, scallions, lemon juice and feta cheese - I made it up as I went along).  Thank you!

I adore tilapia and eat it all the time. I usually get a little fancier at dinner time, however, for lunch (just for me) this was perfect. Paired with a nice spinach salad, I had a delicious low cal meal. Yum and thanks!

This was great.  I seasoned each filet as if the ingredients were written for one filet, instead of splitting the ingredients between the 4 filets and it turned out wonderfully.  I did add a little bit of garlic salt to each, though.  Very tasty!  Will add to my normal meal set.

This is a good, simple recipe for preparing tilapia.  I broiled mine for a few minutes each side rather than baking it and it still turned out fine.

A good recipe as it stands. I cooked the fish for 30 minutes and it was done perfectly.  Tilapia has an undeserved bad reputation because of myths propagated by social media. Don't be stupid, do your own research and thinking.

I followed the recipie exactly against my better judgement.  My advice:   Do not cook for 30 minutes!!  You will have a rubbery, chewy mess.  Add some salt as this is just too bland. We could not eat it.

As another user suggested, I sauteed the garlic, pepper parsley flakes and virgin olive oil (substituted for butter) on the stove first, then drizzled it over the fish before baking it for 10 minutes, instead of 30. When i took it from the oven I sprinkled a bit of garlic powder, pepper, and salt over it, to add a bit more flavor. I also added a bit more lemon juice to the pan before putting it in the oven. The family loved it and went back for seconds! I think its a great recipe, just tweak it to your liking!

I made this in a 17x11 cookie sheet, but I also used folded tin foil (thank you high school penny boats) on which I sprayed Pam. I used bottled lemon juice and garlic powder (1/8 tsp per clove) as well. The lemon flavor was a little too strong (I assume that's because the tin foil held all the juice very close), but the butter flavor was perfect. Try this recipe a few times to see what method works best in your home. 
Tilapia has a typical 'fishy' texture which may upset picky eaters, but the flavors were great. Would highly recommend as a nice recipe for adult guests, and use with caution with younger, pickier eaters. Pairs well with Alfredo pasta, and (for adults) a white wine.

We tried it both ways.  I made the first week as directed above and it was delicious.  Second try, I did as stated above and dipped the fish in egg, smothered it with Panko breadcrumbs and Parmesan cheese for extra flavor...  That was even more amazing as far as crunchiness and flavor.  I'm making it with the breadcrumbs and Parm cheese tomorrow night for dinner.  Either way you make it, it's delicious!

NOTE:  I used fresh parsley.

This was the best tilapia I have ever had. My husband doesn't even like tilapia, but he loved this dish so much! I covered the bottom of the baking dish with a little bit of olive oil to add extra flavor. Also, my fish was cooked perfectly after 20 minutes. It was flaky, but still moist!

I really liked the sauce, especially since I substituted fresh parsley for dried.  In retrospect, I think this would be best served over some pasta or rice, as it would soak up the delicious garlic, butter, and lemon combination. I think I will try this with a different type of fish, or possibly with shrimp or scallops.

I truly enjoyed this recipe. I didn't have parsley on hand. I used dill. It came out beautifully. I paired it with Brussels sprouts, and red beans and rice. Very delicious dinner!!!

Tastes great and simple! I used semi-thawed tilapia and cooked it on the BBQ for about 15 minutes, wrapped in foil. I used olive oil and garlic powder instead of butter and garlic cloves, and it still came out tastey. Served with rice pilaf.

This  was great!All i did was make sure my tilapia was washed properly with cold water.I used 2T of butter but ended up adding a little more while sautaeeing in the  garlic powder, (instead of the garlic cloves)chili flakes,little oregano,little basil,parsley,and a little onion powder to pour over my salt and pepper now seasoned talapia.After all the seasoning i already had the oven heating up to 400degrees and it was ready to get cookin!I threw that pan inside with my fish and left it in there for 17mins and it came out great.But remember people cooking times may very when it comes to fish because of the sizes like how big or small or thickness ect.It came out great,my house smelled great and i also drizzled very little parmesan cheese over the fish and let it finish cooking .This is a really good recipe its fast,easy and for people like me its great because you can have a great meal for your healthy dieting goals as wel all know fish is packed with good proteins.Another plus is talapia has low mercury levels ,so your not completely screwed and you can also enjoy a great meal before you die!Also making this dish has inspired me to want to cook,and play around with more  complex and  exotic recepies

6/14:  very good.  used 3 pieces of tilapia, rinsed and patted dry.  i melted the 3 tblsp. butter, 3 cloves of minced garlic, and 2 tblsp lemon juice (next time use 3 tblsp lemon juice) to cook the garlic.  then let it cool for 10 min. when cool pour over the fish and let it marinate for a while.  bake at 400 for 10 minutes until it flakes with a fork.  i also added parsley and some fresh dill, s&p and old bay along with the marinade.  we all liked it alot. matthew i breaded his fish, someday he will eat this.

This recipe was easy and very tasty.  I always look to see other peoples variations and I loved adding the italian flavoured bread crumbs and parmesan cheese near the end of cooking.  I also cooked the fish at a higher heat 400.  Tonight I am trying this recipe using salmon.

This was my first attempt ever making fish. It turned out great! My husband had 3 pieces so that says something. I did a few things different, I made a foil boat for each filet. I also sauteed fresh parsley, 3 cloves of garlic, 4 tbsp butter and 3 tbsp fresh lemon juice then spooned it over each piece. My filets came frozen so I baked 5 pieces for 25 minutes on 400 degrees. I will be making this again! Thanks!

A very good and simple fish dish.  We happen to enjoy Tilapia  so that is not an issue for us.  My boyfriend would like to try this with cod as well.  A definite do over.

I've finally found a fish I actually like and this is a great way to cook it! I added a couple of tablespoons of finely minced onion, used dill instead of the parsley, and served with rice cooked in cream of mushroom soup. Ohh, mmm, delish!!! The garlic flavor is subtle, not overwhelming. Everyone ate their alloted portions and were looking for more! I'd call this a keeper!

I made this last night.  It was quick, very easy and absolutely delicious.  I tried baking it for only 10 minutes, as one reviewer suggests, but the fish was still pink.  It took the full 30 minutes as the recipe calls for, but it was well worth the wait -- and still quick as far as I'm concerned.

Based on other reviews and personal preferences, I made the following changes:
I sauteed A LOT of garlic, at least 8 cloves, with half a stick of butter, garlic salt and dried parsley on medium low. When it was almost ready, I added lemon juice from 1/2 lemon. I baked the lightly salted tilapia on one side until almost done, then turned it, poured the garlic butter sauce over it, and let it bake a few more minutes. I served it with basmati rice and some more lemon juice. It was absolutely awesome!

Not bad, just not exciting as is. As some reviewers have suggested, I added salt. Also I added a little crushed red pepper flakes to give it some zip. I also used olive oil to keep the bad fats down.. Overall, pretty good.

I was tired of making the same recipe for tilapia so decided to look on here. I read through many of the reviews and decided to go with saut√©ing the garlic in the butter along with adding the dried parsley and lemon juice with sprinkling the Parmesan cheese on top then bake at the time listed above and it was DELICIOUS! Oh, I also sprinkled some cajun seasoning on the fish before pouring the mixture on it. Yummy yummy, it's super good!

I used MommyFromSeattle's suggestions and it turned out great! I microwaved 3-4 tbsp butter with 3 large cloves of minced garlic, then added 2 tbsp lemon juice and poured it over the 6 fillets. Sprinkled them with pepper, dried parsley, crushed ritz crackers and baked (on a foil lined baking sheet) at 400 degrees for 8 minutes.

I've always been hesitant about preparing fish because I don't like that 'fishy' taste. But in order to pursue healthier eating while I try to lose weight, we bought a bag of frozen fillets at Sams Club. I stumbled upon this recipe and decided to try it. My sister was over for lunch the day that I made it. She loved it. So did my husband and I. Anyway, we have already made it a couple more times and I am sure that this will be a staple for our healthier eating lifestyles. Thanks for this recipe!

Easy and tasty! I added half a can of petite diced tomatoes, a little salt, and a total of 3 cloves of garlic. I also just cut the butter up into pieces and spread those out over the fish rather than melting it. I only cooked it for about 25 min. as my fillets were on the smaller side. Will definitely make again.

excellent! But differently add old bay seasoning and top with panco.  Cook for 8 minuets on 400 degrees and then broil for 2 min

Delicious! I'm not a fish-lover, but I've been trying to add it to my diet. We did this in a foil packet and added mango butter (from a jar) on top and it was perfect. I ate it with a brown rice made from the same herbs and garlic combination. Yum.

I love this recipe and so does my husband. I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and added a touch more butter than lemon. I also added some salt and a Table spoon of dry white wine. The wine really adds something. I also mixed the butter, lemon juice, garlic, and white wine together and then poured it on top of the fish. I seasoned the fish with salt and pepper before adding the liquid mixture. I added the parsley after the liquid mixture. I use this recipe quite often and with several types of fish.

This was a really quick, easy, and yummy recipe.  I made one minor change where I used about three heavy dashes of garlic powder instead o fchopped garlic as I was out of fresh. 

Great meal, very light tasting, but flavorful.  I had enough for lunch leftovers and LOVED it all over again.  This one is a keeper.

This was a very easy meal to prepare. All the ingredients needed are everyday kitchen items. My 2 and 3 year old LOVED it and they are very picky. For a busy stay at home mom it was easy easy easy. I paired it with yellow squash sauteed with fresh garlic (three cloves), onion (1/2 small chopped), 2tbs of better, basil, salt, and pepper to taste. My family enjoyed every bit of it

Used Dover Sole and totally overcooked it because it's a much thinner fillet.  I only baked for 20 mins but 10 would have been better.  Only used tiny dabs of butter and placed on top of the fish because my hubby hates butter on fish and used EVOO.  Had to add some salt.  Pretty good though.

Was pretty good, Im not a huge fan of "soft" fish so I think next time Ill make it the same but saute the fish with the garlic.  Give it a little bit of crunch!

I made this one evening for my 12 year old niece and myself.  I was concerned she'd be picky about the fish, like her aunt is.  We both really loved it, and was so easy to make.  I sent a copy of the recipe home with my niece so her mother can make it for her too. I'm even making it as one of the entrees for our dinner on Rosh Hashanah.

I'm not a fan of Tilapia and I thought this was great! Used the idea of making foil pockets.  Will definitely make again.

The flavor was far too mild, you could hardly taste any of the seasoning. It wasn't bad, it just could be a lot more flavorful.

Great, simple recipe!  I omitted the parsley flakes and substituted olive oil for butter and baked the fillets in foil packets.

Pretty good!  I used 3-4 T butter, juice of one lime, 2 tilapia filets (1 pound).  Cooked two cloves of garlic in butter for a minute or two, salted tilapia before topping with lime juice, butter and garlic, and cooked for a little over 15 minutes at 375.  I was afraid of overcooking it, but I actually thought the thinner and more fully-cooked parts tasted better than the thicker parts, so I'll cook it longer next time.  I also thought it needed quite a bit more salt (I'm a saltaholic, though).

The lemon overpowered the fish, making me not like this meal so much. Taming that down, I think it would be a simple dinner. No surprises.

I loved this recipe...I added to it by sauteing, red onions, yellow, orange, red & green bell peppers, with olive oil & throwing on top before baking & a little bit of accent. Also sprinkled on green onions. Absolutely delicious! & quick

I followed MommyFromSeattle's advice in saute-ing the garlic first. Turned out great! I cook my fish generally at 375 for 15 min and it turns out well.

Turned out pretty tasty. I will definitely make it again. I did use less butter and added some olive oil to compensate.  I didn't use as much lemon as suggested but I think I will next time as I didn't have much of a lemon flavor in mine.

Tilapia is not to expensive and good on the budget. This is delightful change of food. Healthy as well. We made it almost to the recipe and did coconut oil instead of butter.

Just tried this for the first time. Thanks for posting, Eireann... and for the follow up post for the EVOO in exchange for the butter! :) I think I put too much lemon, but other than that it was pretty tastey and I like that it's a healthy meal. I actually used Smart Balance instead of butter and cut the amount down. I may have to try it with the low fat Parmesan Cheese like others have suggested! Tilapia is not an easy fish to make flavorful so I'm glad to have found this recipe. Quick & easy!

Tried this recipe last night. It was okay,but I would have preferred more of a prominent lemon flavor. My husband enjoyed it though. I plan to make this again,God Willing,and modify it by adding more lemon and less pepper. :)

I have made this recipe 3 times in the past few weeks, and I am not one to make the same thing very often.  The whole family loves this, and it's so easy my daughter made it herself.  I especially love how simple the ingredients are--easy to have on hand.  Served with roasted asparagus it has become an instant family favorite.

This was really good.  I steamed my fish in a parchment paper pouch in the oven and used "I can't believe it's not butter" and it was delicious!  I'm not a fan of fish, but this made me a fan! =)

This recipe was super simple, and super easy to downsize for one person. I didn't cook the fish for a full 30 minutes (I'm assuming the cook-time is shorter for a smaller amount of fish), but other than that, I really didn't change anything. It was exactly what I have been craving! Thanks for the recipe!

This dish was quite delicious. The subtle taste of lemon and garlic was just the right amount.  My son, who doesn't care for fish too much, couldn't get enough.  This recipe is a keeper for my family.

Wonderful recipe!  Followed basic recipe, just changed the temp to 400 and baked for about 12 min.  Came out perfect.  I cheated and used minced garlic, put in in a plastic measuring cup along with the butter and melted the two together in the microwave for about 20 seconds.  A++!!

A very delicious and simple way to prepare tilapia!  This was my first time cooking fish.  For four fillets, I doubled the suggested amount of lemon juice and butter.  I also used three cloves of garlic.  I sauted the butter, garlic and lemon juice then poured over the fish.  I also sprinkled the fish with black pepper, parsley and paprika then baked at 375 for 15 minutes.  Yummy!

This is a delicious way to prepare Tilapia.  Very healthy and quick.  The only changes I made were to go light on the lemon juice, and I only baked for 20 minutes @ 375.  Very flavorful.

this is the first time I baked fish. I was afraid it was going to be bland (no crust) but me and my husband both really liked it. The only thing I did differant was add paprika. This is a keeper.

I make this in the microwave....
Put fish in a glass dish--season with half the sauce---cover with Saran and micro for 4 minutes--remove from micro, remove saran and pour rest of sauce over fish.
Recover and micro for 3to4 more minutes until fish flakes easily.
All I add is a little Tony Chaceres seasoning.
This is a quicker way to do the fish and it's still delicious.

Outstanding.  Made the changes a couple of reviewers suggested.  Used dill instead of parsley and baked for only 15 minutes.  Quick and good.

This was a nice light way to fix tilapia. We found it to be a bit bland and neither the lemon or garlic really stood out very much. I will probably make it again but it won't go down as one of my favorite ways to prepare tilapia.

Delish! I've tried other tilapia recipes and most of them have tomatoes and/or white wine. That flavor just doesn't bake up well with me. But THIS! This is super tasty and amazingly easy to make. And you will always have everything on hand (especially if you use bottled lemon juice...which I did, but it would be better with fresh for sure!). Really easy, really tasty. Even my 2 and 4 year olds loved it! I added the garlic to the melted butter which made it so easy.

Tasty!  I served it over rice.  I seasoned the fish with salt and pepper and sauteed the lemon, garlic and parsley in butter before pouring it over the filets.  I also coated the filets with italian bread crumbs.  (I used Italian because that is all I had on hand.  It was good).  And at the advice of some of the reviews, I bake the fish at 400 for 10 minutes.  It tasted pretty good!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because of it's simplicity.  It was good, though I felt it was a little too lemony.  I think that would have been better balanced with some dill or tarragon rather than the parsley.  I'm sure I will make it again, however.  It is a nice base recipe to modify a little differently every time.

I like to put parmesan on my fish and cook it about 5 minutes less, and then put it under the broiler on low for a few minutes.  Love it!  Combine it with spinach fettucini and alfredo sauce and sauteed squash and/or zucchini.  Awesome!!

It was simple but not too flavorful. It's nice if you're looking for a lighter meal. My husband and I prefer more seasoning and flavor. I substituted lime juice for the lemon juice and it still tasted pretty good.

Was very good and simple healthy meal starter however. I do not recommend leaving it in the full 30 min. I took mine out a few min early and they were still a little more done than I would have liked but still tasted great. Thanks

Very good recipe!   Would definitely make again.  I only made 3 filets, but they were on the larger side, so I just cut back a smidge on the lemon, butter and parsley.  I wasn't sure if I should cover it while baking or not, but I left it uncovered and it was fine.  Thanks for the recipe!

So easy and SO delicious!  Instead of chopping garlic and dried parsley I just throw on a seasoning mixture like Mrs. Dash and stick it in the oven.  Mmmmm!

Oh YYYUUUMMM!!!  Some of the best tilapia I've had so far!  If your a garlic love triple the garlic!  It's delicious baked onto the fish!  I also used fresh parsley.  Definitely a keeper around here!

this dish is the perfect combination with brown rice and a side of fresh cooked veggies.  it is sweet yet at the same time with a bit of tangy taste that the lemons add to it.  DELICIOUS!!!!!!!

This was good. My son is recovering from having his wisdom teeth removed, and I was looking for a flavorful soft fish he could eat. Poaching it, I used butter, pineapple juice and added the garlic and lime juice to that. I also threw in a teaspoon of coconut butter and at the last minute some diced mango. This was a great tropical dish. I will make it again.

This recipe was great, super simple, and perfect for a light and quick summer/spring lunch. I did tweek the recipe up a bit though. I know this suppose to be healthy lunch but tilapia can get so dry if you don't add enough fat so I melted 6 tbsps instead of 1 I know it seems a lot more but its such a big difference!!. And instead of 3 tbsps of lemons I just used three whole lemons and added about a tbsp of salt. I'm gonna put my version up on the custom side. This is a awesome recipe that anybody who loves fish should try.

I wanted to start making healthier dinner choices so I went out to buy Tilapia to make this recipe and it was fantastic, it was fresh tasting since you use fresh lemon and don't use the bottled lemon juice it doesn't compare, my whole family loved it and I will be making this all the time, thanks for the great recipe

This was a wonderful dish, like most others I only cooked it at 400 for 10 minuets and it came out just great.  Next time I think I will cut down on the lemon juice just a tad, but other than that I don't think this dish needs anything else. Wonderful!

I made this with some thin Dover sole fillets tonight and it came out pretty well.  My husband likes his fish soft, not crisp, so he really liked it.  I thought it came out a bit "fishy" tasting, but that was probably just the fillets that I bought rather than the cooking method.  I cooked it for about 13 minutes at 375 and it flaked just fine.  I'll make sure to dry off my fish a bit more after defrosting as there was melted fish water in the baking dish with the sauce (that might account for the "fishy" taste, too).  Nice lemon garlic flavor; I'll definitely make this again.

Very tasty recipe.  We sauteed the garlic with the butter prior to adding it to the fish, and also doubled the amount of butter.  In addition to the pepper and parsley, we added garlic sea salt.  It was delicious and we'll definitely have it again!

Tilapia is one of my families favorites-this recipe was super easy and really good.  The only thing I did different was melted the butter, garlic and parsely (fresh) in microwave and poured over the fish.

Just made this and it was fantastic! I did change a couple of things though. I used two cloves of garlic and sauted them briefly in some EVOO. I also gave the fish a light coating of italian bread crumbs on the top and used fresh parsely. I will definitely be making this meal again!

This was GREAT!  First I rubbed the fish with the salt, pepper and chili powder and put it in the baking dish.  Then in a separate pan I sauteed the garlic, butter, lemon juice, parsley (and I added red pepper flakes) and then poured the mix on the top of the fish in the baking pan.  I added parmesan cheese on top and baked it for 8 minutes at 400 degrees.  WONDERFUL!

Next time I will not add the garlic as it makes the taste very pungent.  I will probably just add garlic powder.  Also, I added a few tbsps of dried dill and the result was great!

I replaced the parsley with thyme (by accident) and it came out great. It was actually tastier with thyme than it was with parsley.

This was great! i took some of everyone elses advice and coated the fish with chili powder first then put it in the oven and sauteed the lemon and garlic cloves and parsley then poured it on there halfway through and added some cayenne pepper for taste. i actually left the garlic cloves in small peices on top the fish and ate them. It really made the fish have a lot of taste and texture. my husband loved it!

I wasn't too crazy about this recipe.  It tasted kind of sour for me, probably because of the lemon juice.  I will not make again.

Very tasty. Sauteed the garlic in the butter with the lemon juice and parsley as suggested by others. Perfect recipe without complicated ingredients- had everything already in my kitchen. Very fast and easy to make, as well as healthy. Some people said to cook for a shorter length of time, but mine took 20 minutes, and could've went the full 30 if I wanted it a bit less juicy. My fillets weren't too thick, either. Weird. Next time, I will probably use the entire 30, and use fresh lemon, instead of the little squirt bottle kind. Thanks Eireann! Will try it with olive oil instead of butter like you said, too!

I took this recipe and ran with it.  I roughly doubled the recipe, sauteed garlic in butter and olive oil, added white wine (a chenin blanc, but a stronger, oaky chardonnay would've been great), and after sprinkling the (amazingly fresh) tilapia fillets lightly with a pre-pckg'd cajun seasoning, ladled just a bit over each fillet before broiling, with a bit of fresh dill on the pan.   I served the remainder of the sauce over bow tie pasta with a bit of dill and freshly grated parm, with broccoli on the side.  Such a light, perfect meal, truly.  So perfect that I can't imagine it w/out the white wine - do try it!  With lemon wedges and extra dill upon plating, this was a beautifully simple meal I'll make again and again.

I've never cooked fish before but this recipe sounded fool proof so I tried it. Turned out fantastic! I already bought more fish fillets so I can cook it again! The only thing I did different was I mixed the lemon juice, butter, garlic, and parsley into a little glass bowl and stuck it in the microwave until the butter melted. I stirred that up and poured it over frozen Tilapia fillets. I think it took about 20 - 25 minutes for the frozen fillets to cook. Maybe the original poster used frozen fillets as well? Regardless, fantastic recipe!

I changed some ingredient amounts plus added powder onion, italian season, lemon pepper spice, Greek Cavat season, and crushed red pepper Melted everything in with the butter and olive oil. This way I could taste the sauce while it was on the stove, instead of sprinkling ingredients on the fish and not knowing what it tastes like until it was done. My mistake was adding too much lemon pepper and Greek seasoning which I originally didn't feel it was that strong but they both have a lot of pepper. Definitely cut back on cooking time, 15 minutes was good for me. So I would make it again and just fine tune the ingredient amounts.

Great recipe!  I made it just as the directions called for and my husband and I were treated to some very yummy tilapia!  Next time I might spice it up a little more - garlic cloves and italian seasoning for sure.

I tried this tonight and I didnt care for it. I thought it was rather bland. Possibly cooks error. Just wanted a different way to cook tilapia other than breading it. Thanks for the recipe though.

Good recipe. My boyfriend really liked it and he's picky. I sauteed the garlic, added butter and lemon juice. Seasoned the fish with salt, pepper, and paprika (I didn't have parsley)Then I sealed in the flavor by grilling on oven grill pan thingy...then I added the butter/garlic sauce and let it soak it up on the grill. It was delicious.

This is amazingly delicious!  I didn't have parsley so I used lemon pepper, and I used a little bit more lemon juice.  I also tried the Parmesan cheese as one reviewer suggested.  Delicious!

I had this just yesterday at my BFF's house, and she's a novice cook. I wasn't a fan of Tilapia until now. The fish was light and flavorful. The lemon was not too overpowering. She seasoned her fish with a little Old Bay Seasoning and Pepper, I like a little more seasoning so I'd add garlic powder and a little salt to mine. Overall this was incredible. She put it in the oven and we took a walk outside and when we got back her place smelled wonderful! We didn't have side dishes, but I think this would pair beautifully with a yummy rissotto and sauteed fresh asparagus. Add a glass of your favorite white wine and voila'! You've got a quick and easy meal that could easily be on the menu at your favorite gourmet restaurant. Bon Appetit!

This was an ok recipe for tilapia.  I prefer some other recipes though and probably won't make this one again.

Far too citrus based for our tastes. Maybe if it was less lemon juice and more butter.

I cook a lot of fish, and i'm always trying something different with my tilapia.  until now that is.  i changed it up just a bit by dipping filets in italian style bread crumbs to get a very thing coating before pouring butter mixture on top.  take it from a fish lover, this is a good one.

I actually, juiced 2 lemons and marinated the tilapia in the lemon juice for about 1 hour prior to cooking.  I did take the advice of other reviewers and saute the butter, lemon, garlic, & parsley together prior to putting on the fish.  I also added some lemon zest.  I baked 4 filets for 12 minutes and they turned out perfect!  My family loved it!!

This was very good, quick, and easy!  It actually had more flavor than I had thought it would.  The only thing different I did was crush the garlic, add it to the melted butter, then drizzled that over the fish.  Here in Honduras we don't have North American lemons, but we do have limones (which is more of a lime), and I used that instead of the lemon that was called for and squeezed it over the fish.  I will definitely make this again.  Even my kids enjoyed it.

It's definitely not a bad recipe, but I wouldn't say it is outstanding either. I gave the tilapia more time to marinate in hopes it would take on more flavor, in addition to adding salt/pepper/a dash of white wine/a dash of Emeril's Essence...but it just didn't say "Aha!" to me. However, I like a big punch of flavor. My husband, who hates fish and doesn't like anything too robust in flavor, thought it was fine.

My wife and I enjoyed this for two days. Served with rice made with chicken broth. For the second day I combined the rice with the fish, added about 1/3 cup of dry white wine and heated for 15 min. in the oven at 275. The second night was the best.

Great flavor!  I used whiting fillets and it was still very good. I always make extra sauce and I also sauted the garlic in butter before adding it to the fish.

I thought this recipe was a good starting point, but I found that it didn't have enough lemon flavor.  I think next time I will marinate the chicken for a couple hours.  I also noticed I was out of parsley, so I used an Italian seasoning mix.  I served the fish with grilled zucchini dusted with black pepper seasoning salt & garlic powder, mixed with plain rice.

We really quite enjoyed this recipe.  It is simple and quick.  I did over cook the fillets though based on the recipe directions.  Depending on the thickness of the fillets, I would cut the time back and check after 15 to 20 minutes.

SOOOO yummy! Easy and delicious! When I made this I served it with white rice (I used instant so this could be a super quick meal). I added some of the fresh lemon juice and parsley to the rice, it was a really nice touch.  I sauteed the garlic in the butter for a moment before I put it over the fish like other people recommended and I think that was a good idea. I also threw some lightly steamed broccoli with the fish while baking. I found this gave my veggies a lot of flavor without having to add any salt.  I love this dish and it always impresses people when I make it (if only they really knew how easy it is!).

OMG! absolutely wonderful and full of flavor. I took the advice of member JGOODSON.. great tips, thank u. I doubled the sauce and layered half on the bottom of the pan and the other half on the top. Cut open the fillets first so sauce soaks in fish. Cut flesh of lemons and place on fish before cooking. I also added garlic powder; cooked for 25 min @375.

This was an excellent recipe. I had read a couple other reviews for this reciepe and altered it a bit also:  - 3-4 TBPS of butter - 2 TBPS of lemon - Finely smashed ritz crackers to cover fish (for a little extra kick) - 3 garlic cloves (I like garlic)  It was fantastic. My boyfriend LOVED it!

This turned out very well, I used half butter and half olive oil and heated that up in the microwave with the chopped garlic. A quick and easy recipe that I'll be sure and use again.

This was good - I followed other reviews and added Red Pepper Flakes in the sauce, and sauteed it all first. I also added Chili Pepper on the fish before baking it. It was nice and light, and very easy.

You have to really like the taste of fish to like this or eat really healthy. It was pretty bland...Also I would not recommend cooking fish for 30mins, 15mins to the most.

This was wonderful, my husband said it was the best fish he has had in a long time.  I melted the butter in a pan, added the garlic and then the lemon juice and parsley  I then spooned it over the talapia so the garlic would not be so raw.  I cooked the fish at 400 degrees for 12 minutes and it was done perfeclty.  Thanks for a great recipe that I can use over and over.

I have been making this for years - something I just threw together on a whim ... it's a family favorite in our house and the differences I use are:  fish frozen straight to the oven, bake for 30 minutes at 350, use italian seasoning mix and add in some capers!  Yum!  Smells great, quick and easy too, especially served over brown rice with a green vegetable!

I followed the recipe, but the fish was very bland. I may try it again, but use more of the lemon, butter,& garlic. I think that is soaked on through and out the fish as it baked. I may add it in the middle of the cooking time. I also didn't cook it 30 min. More like 10 and I like my fish a little more done than some.

Very yummy! I think I might increase the lemon and the garlic next time, as well as saute the garlic. But it's a great base recipe for a classic idea!

This tasted wonderful.  My husband turned to me and said, "Honey, this is delicious fish" - and he can be a hard one to please.  Even my 2 year old son ate his entire portion and asked for more "ish"

I followed the suggestions of others and sauted the ingredients and then poured that over the fish.  I cooked it for 20 min. at 375 degrees.  This will now be part of our regular meal rotation.

Very good!  I melted butter/olive oil mixture with chopped garlic and let it sit for awhile to soften and to infuse the flavor of the garlic before adding to the fish.  And, added the bread crumbs. Yum!

Very easy and tasty.  It forms a nice sauce.  I sprinkled smoked paprika on top, which adds a good smoky flavor to it.  Only about 1/2 teaspoon worth.

Wow! I absolutly loved this Tilapia. I have never made Tilapia or even tasted it before i made this for dinner tonight. it was amazing i did make a few changes on accident. i confused this and a recipe for Rosemary pasta in roasted garlic sauce, i was saposed to put 1/4 cup chicken stalk in the noodles but put it in the fish!! oops!! it was a phanominal oops though. im not usualy a fan of realy lemon flavored fish but i think the chicken stalk calmed down the lemon flavor a bit. Also in the last 2 min. i turned the oven to broil and sprinkled some parmisian cheese on top. it turned out amazing, light, moist with a little crunch on top. couldnt have asked for a better first time recipe.

Pretty good for a quick and healthy dinner. I used evoo spray instead of the butter, a splash of white wine, used dried dill instead of parsley, and topped with a few slices of fresh lemon. Wrapped in foil and baked. Flaky and light. Served with roasted veggies and a salad. Thanks!

I was expecting something a bit more flavorful when I read the ingredients. Next time I make this, I'll do it with salmon to see if it turns out better. I think I will take the suggestions of another reviewer & saute the garlic first. The butter sauce was very tasty when mixed with rice pilaf. lol

Tasty!  Cut this recipe in half for just the 2 of us.  Sauteed 2 cloves of garlic with some butter and then added the fresh lemon juice and poured over top of the tilapia.  Didn't have any parsley, so used a seafood &  fish seasoning.  Baked for about 15 mins at 375 and served alongside some mushrooms and zuchinni, yummy!

I REALLY wanted to like this recipe but I didn't. I used extra virgin olive oil instead of butter to cut out the saturated fat and dried basil instead of dried parsley but kept everything else the same. The fish was still really bland and didn't have any flavor. Everyone I made it for agreed.

I love baked tilapia, but I just use spray olive oil instead of melted butter or liquid oil.  In addition, I sometimes throw in some fresh veggies such as mushrooms, tomatoes, thinly sliced squash or red potatoes.  I spray the veggies with olive oil as well, and then sprinkle with garlic salt and basil.  I agree with the person who said that 30 minutes is too long.  Depending upon the thickness of the tilapia, 10-20 minutes is plenty.

Pretty bland.  I used a lot of garlic salt (which I hardly ever use) at the table to make it palatable to my family, but I've definitely had better.  I cooked it in a skillet for about 5 minutes per side - nice moist texture.

I just made this for dinner and it was fabulous! I used more butter than the recipe called for, I LOVE butter, and seasoned the fish with salt and cayenne pepper on both sides. I also took the advice from the other reviews and sauted the butter, garlic and lemon juice before. Raised the temp to 400 and cooked for about 15 mins! I will definately cook this one again!

They were a lot easier to make than my boyfriend thought. He was nervous about them sticking to the pan and crumbling but they didn't. I don't like fish so I didn't try it but they flew off the serving plate at a birthday party so I think they were a big hit.

I made this with stripper fillets instead and then put them in double-lined foil packets on the barbecue. I used a combo of lemon/lime juice and fresh Italian parsley. These came out great, I think the recipe is versatile for any fish. Oh, I made more of the butter mixture as well to cover the fillets.

Very simple and tasty. I didn't use so much parsley. Great and quick. Next time I will grill it.

Delicious !! I used about half of a cooking spoon of shedd's spread Country Crock (this is pretty much what I use to cook most of my meals) and saut√©ed the 7 big cloves of garlic, dry parsley, the juice of 2 large lemons, and a little bit of white wine. Drizzled it over the striped bass fillet, which was sprinkled with Dukee Grill Creations Original Chicken and Fish Seasoning, garlic salt, and little bit of black pepper. Baked it at 400 degrees for like 25 or so minutes, until it was done. My kids loved it, and they usually hate fish. I know we all change this recipe around, but I thank you, Eireann, for giving us the start idea ;)

My partner loved this and I thought it was decent.  For two tilapia filets, I used one fresh squeezed lemon, 2 cloves over garlic, 1 T. butter and enough dried parsley to look like the picture.  Also, I only cooked it for about 20 minutes and it was plenty well done.  I thought this went really well with Baked Sweet Potatoes and Sesame Green Beans, both from this site.

I served it with cod this time.  I thought the tilapia was FAR superior.

MommyFromSeattle is definitely on to something with those Ritz crackers... I made 2 fillets with the cracker coating (kids / DH), and a plain one for myself.  The crackers MADE it.  Mine was good, but "Meh."  I used less lemon juice.  Added in some Pinot Grigio, red pepper flakes, and gobs more garlic.  Will make again - but only with the Crackers and jazz it up more - maybe more pepper flakes or cayenne to kick it up.

I followed this recipe pretty closely, I used more olive oil and less butter.  I also sprinkled parmesan as well while baking and added the chili flakes at the end before serving.  I was expecting more flavor, however my boyfriend loved it.  Not one of the most memorable recipes for me but it was good.

Great flavor. The recommended cook time was too long so then I tried the 400* for 12 minutes as another reviewer suggested and that wasn't long enough. The fish was cooked through but I didn't enjoy the flavor as much, it was sort of wet. Needs to cook a little longer to dry a bit.

pretty good - a little light on the flavor, next time I'd probably add more lemon.  I did saute the garlic which helped.  nice simple fish recipe, kids liked it.

I have never cooked fish before.  I do not like the smell or taste of fish and was afraid to try it.  However, I want to try to cook healthier and I had heard Tilapia is a mild fish.  So, I gave this recipe a try.  It was perfect for a first-time fish cook. I loved this recipe!  It was very easy.  I was surprised how tasty it was.  I caught myself sneaking some of the left-overs later.  We doubled the sauce and served it all over rice and with steamed veggies.  Delicious and healthy!  Thumbs up from my family.

I'll go ahead and preface this review by saying: I am not a fan of fish. I'm not a fan of fishy flavor, so I am biased towards fish that has *lots* of flavor.

With that said, the fish was good and very easy to prepare, hence four stars. I could have used more spice, or more garlic, or something to ramp of the flavor a little bit. I'll probably give it another go, with a little more additional spices.

This didn't turn out very good at all. Taste was off, and I had to cover it in lemon just to make it edible. The recipe is pretty simple, not sure if I did it wrong or what but I won't be making this again.

Nice & flavorful, not to lemony, and it's easy. I sauted the garlic in butter add lemon juice & parsley, then poured over the fish, as suggested by others. I added just a splash of hot sauce

We've tried a few recipes for tilapia and we put parmesean cheese on top. We followed what other reviewers said and my husband LOVED this. He said it was the best-tasting fish he had ever had. Even my daughter, who hates any fish, ate it, so it had to be great!

I decided to try the original recipe without making any changes and although it turned out great, I do feel it does need more flavor.  I will use the suggestions from other reviewers the next time I make this dish.  It was very easy to prepare and easy to reheat the leftovers at work the next day.

I loved this recipe...I added more garlic and squeezed and entire lemon.  I also cooked it on the stove in a little chicken broth.  I did not use real butter.  I used I can't beieve its not butter.  But, it now my favorite.  Also, I used chicken once and it came out just as good.

I made this exactly according to the recipe and thought it was extremely bland. I may make again - however if I do, I would add some extra seasonings prior to baking and then make up some additional lemon butter sauce to pour over the fish after baking.

This was soooo easy and delicious and flakey.  I soaked the fish in the lemon juice as one review suggested and then grated the garlic into melted butter and covered the fish with it. I put the whole thing on foil lined pan, a little salt & pepper and served with a nice salad and baked potato. Its a keeper for me.

Good set of spices, allways wanted to know how to cook that fish with the really strange name.  It is real good just cooking it in the pan with the butter/galic sauce and sprinkling the rest of the spices on it.

I'm not a big seafood eater, but tilapia is one of the few fish that I will eat. This recipe was *delicious*.  I look for recipes that are uncomplicated with few additions to my pantry staples. Easy, uncomplicated....exactly what I look for in a recipe.   I would recommend this, and I would also be comfortable experimenting with other ingredients to enhance -- a great basic recipe.

Delish! I took the advice of others and used 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 3 tablespoons butter. Also I baked them at 400 for ten minutes. I had never made fish before, and I still can't BELIEVE how easy it was to make it that perfectly :)

Flavor is excellent.  Very easy for a weeknight dinner.  Cooking time needs to be adjusted to the cut of fish you have, though.  My filets were pretty thin and cooked completely in 15 minutes.

This was really good. It was awsome right out of the oven but much better the next day in between two slices of bread with a little reduced fat mayo. It was like a healthy fish sandwich. I think the flavor melded together even more by the next day. I put a piece of the fish with some of the sauce on a slice of italian bread and put another piece of bread on top and nuked it for like 30 seconds and the put the mayo on one of the slices. It was awsome!!

Quick, easy and very yummy!  I took some of the suggestions made by others and sauteed the garlic in the butter, did not pour the lemon juice over the fish until the last minute and baked at 400 for 10 minutes.  I will be serving this again soon and often.

This was very easy to make.  Everyone in my family chowed down on it.  I don't think I used enough lemon juice so I had to added some before serving.  I will add more next time before cooking.

This recipe was absolutely fabulous! I took a few suggestions and increased the butter to 4 tablespoons and then sauteed the garlic in the butter, mixing in the spices, in the mean time pouring the lemon on the tilapia to let it soak in the flavor. After  I finished saute-ing, I poured the mix over the fish and baked it at 400 F for 12 minutes. The result was perfect, tender, flaky fish. In agreement with some other people's reviews, the lemon was pretty tangy. I personally love lemon, and thought it was great, but my husband found it a bit excessive and sprinkled some salt on his fish to calm down the lemon. Thank you!

This is delicious and easy, served over a bed of cous-cous. I add the lemon afterwards because cooking the lemon juice changes its flavor somewhat.  I also cook shrimp this way. I find that the measurements don't need to be exact- just throw everything together and it comes out good, so it just makes life so much easier when you don't have to pull out your measuring utensils!

This was good, but I didn't taste much of the lemon in the tilapia. Maybe next time I'll marinate the fillets in lemon juice prior to cooking. Very fast though, I was done prepping before my oven was even preheated! :)

We often buy frozen tilapia from our local wholesale store and are always looking for new ways to prepare it. This quick and flavorful recipe will be a standby from now on!

I agree with previous reviewers on adding more garlic, sauteeing it, and only backing 10-15 minutes. Also, I put almond slices on top, which was a nice tasty crunch and delicious.

Maybe a good recipe.  I think my fish was just too fishy.  Didn't eat it.  Either did the cat.  I will try again with better tilapia maybe.

It was actually very good this first time I tasted it, although it was a little bland, like others have said.  I tried this recipe again, this time marinating the fillets in the mix overnight before I cooked it the next evening.  I just poured everything straight into a 9x13 pan and put it in the oven.  It was a lot better, and a whole lot less bland!

this dish had great ingredients, but to make it more flavorful, i would marinate for at least 30 minutes and it also needs some salt.

Pretty good. Definitely make sure you have less lemon juice than butter, because my fish turned out way too sour.

The first time I made this I was not impressed... very bland.  I had never had tilapia before and thought I wouldn't have it again.  Since I was trying not to waste the leftovers though, I decided the next day to add a splash of white wine to each fillet and a lot more lemon juice and salt.  Then I topped them with thin slices of lemon with each fillet wrapped in foil and warmed them up in the oven again.  Came out great!

I made this last night and it was very good.  I sauted the garlic, used half parsley and half basil, a sprinkle of paprika and parmesean cheese.  The lemon juice added a lot of flavor.  Next time i think i might us a little more of the lemon juice.  Def. not 30 minutes in the oven.  i pulled mine out in 15 and it was perfect.  thanks for an easy great recipe.  Perfect when you need something quick for dinner.

DELICIOUS!!! we made this for dinner with guests and its all gone.  i read a lot of the reviews and took some of the advice like increase the lemon juice and reduce baking time to 15 min and then 2 min on broil.  This tastes a lot like Shrimp scampi but so delicate.  very nice recipe.

So great and so easy. I am single, and I love that I can make this quickly when I come home from work. I like it with asparagus, which I just put in the oven with the fish. (Plus that means there is only one pan to wash!)

I made the changes that were suggested by previous reviewers (more butter than lemon juice, baking high temp for short time) and hubby and kids loved it.  I don't care for fish but I'm trying to learn to like it.  Nonetheless, I ate half of my fillet and shared the rest with my kids.

I tried the recipe with extra butter and garlic as suggested by several reviewers, and I found it "too" greasy and "too" garlicy.  Next time I will again saute the garlic in the butter as suggested, but will use the amount closer to that suggested in the recipe.  All and all it was very tasty, but my kitchen smelled of garlic for hours afterwards.

Wow, this turned out great.  I add pampered chef's dill mix, lemon zest, and white wine... followed other reviews and add hot peppers and shorten my cooking time.  THANKS

I couldn't taste the sauce, all I could taste was the fish.  It was not "fishy", but no real pizazz!  I increased the garlic and decrased the lemon and added Old Bay Seasoning.

I would give this only 2 stars, but my boyfriend loved it so much he ate two servings the night I made it and another the next day. I thought it was just... blah. I love lemon and garlic, so I thought adding a little more of each would help with a bit of red pepper flakes but it just wasn't right for me. I don't think I'll be making this again. Thank you for the recipe, though.

I wanted to keep it healthy, so I skipped the butter on the top...I don't recommend doing that.  It was pretty try and bland.  I'll try this one again.

Great recipe!  I baked the tilapia frozen at 400 for 30 minutes. The frozen veggies I threw in at the same time cooked perfectly.

I thought this was delicious!! I used catfish fillets instead of tilapia.  I cooked the buttery carrots(which I got off this website) and white rice with it.

I followed other peoples advise and sauteed the butter(I had to use I can't believe it's not butter), garlic, lemon, parmesean(just a little bit) and red pepper and then poured it on the fish. I cooked it about 15 minutes. We really enjoyed it! I will definitely add this into our dinner rotation.

I didn't really like this recipe too much.  Maybe it's just that I don't like tilapia or something, but I thought it tasted too fishy.  I'm giving it four stars, though, because my husband liked it.

Quick and easy.  Nice garlic and butter flavor.  Not too overpowering.  Needs sprinkled with salt after baking to bring out the flavors a little bolder.

This recipe was very good. I used lime juice instead and substituted a lemon-pepper seasoning for the black pepper. It stayed very moist and was a nice change from breaded fish.

This was very bland and I even used extra seasonings. My kids and husband ate it but no one asked for seconds.

This was wonderful! I omitted the butter, and the pan spray. Instead i just coated the backing pan lightly with olive oil. I made this because I was craving my homemade tartar sauce, and I ended up eating the fish without sauce!

Not bad, but if you are using it on Talapia w/ skin, the flavor doesn't soak in. I will try it again on a skinless fillet!

Wasn't impressed.  My husband enjoyed it though.  I will not make this again.  The fish has a poached texture and perhaps this turned me off.  I think I prefer that texture with salmon or trout but not white fish.

To be fair, we are not the biggest eaters/enjoyers of seafood. But I feel as though the topping(s) was not enough to fully flavor the tilapia. Perhaps if you squeezed the lemon juice over breading and then put the other ingredients over top this recipe would be more successful. Healthier? No. But tastier. It just didn't fill us up enough.

I doubled the butter and mixed it with the garlic and some Pinot Griggio in a small pot before pouring over the tilapia. The white wine really added a new level of awesome.

This was pretty good but I did take the suggestion of another reviewer to add more butter and less lemon juice. It just needs a little seasoning--a little salt makes it so much better.

This was very tasty!  Even my husband, who is not a fan of white fish, loved it.  The only change I may make is to cook it a few minutes less than the recipe said to.  It was just at that perfect/almost dry stage.  But very yummy!

It was delicious! I didn‚Äôt look at the comments (adjustments to the orig. recipe) until I had already put it in the oven, but did make the change in temp and cook time... (Thank you for that suggestion, btw:)  
Anyway, It came out really, REALLY good and the family agreed. I was actually surprised with how easy and tasty it was.

I used 3 filets.  Sauteed 2 T. butter, 2 T. EVOO w/ 3 cloves ch. garlic and 2 T. lemon juice.  .  Make sure to not have more lemon juice than butter/EVOO.    After I poured butter mixture over fish I sprinkled on garlic powder, onion powder and a little Old Bay.  Baked at 400 for around 6-10 min.  Topped w/a little grated parmesan and panko crumbs.and put under broiler for a minute or two.  When  I topped w/crumbs I spooned lemon/butter mixture over top to moisten the crumbs.

Can‚Äôt believe how easy this was and it turned out amazing! I followed the recipe exactly as written even though others said not to leave it in the oven so long, it turned out perfect. Will definitely make again!

I used one tsp of lemon per filet but should have used 1.5. I sauteed garlic salt in butter and then poured it over the filets. Topped it with parmesan cheese before baking at 410 F for 18 minutes. 
Family loved it! Definitely a keeper.

This was delicious and so easy. The only thing I did different was use dried basil instead of parsley because I was out of parsley. I will definitely be making this again.

Easy to make. One caution, I took notes from previous reviewers and set 375 degree for 20 minutes. I still feel a little bit too long. Next time I‚Äôll bake for 15 minutes. The thin part of the fish turned out a little bit dry. The think part is pretty good though. Thank you for the recipe.

It would have been better with less lemon juice, maybe 1 Tablespoon or even none at all. The baking time was much too long, it should have been no more than 15 or 20 minutes. I will make it again with the changes.  It really is a quick and easy weeknight meal. Thanks for posting.

Receipe was perfect. I had 4 large filets and made it with magerine instead of butter. Alot of reviewers suggested not to use magerine but during my preop diet phase that's all I could use and needless to say it tasted perfect to me. I would definitely make it again.

I used fillet of sole instead of tilapia, fresh parsley instead of dried and drizzled some white wine. I also sprinkled paprika over it to give it color. Baked it in a Pyrex uncovered. Came out really good.

I used just two filets (for 2 people) but kept the other ingredients the same. Added a few lemon slices, splash of white wine and a couple shakes of parmesan before baking. Very nice dish, served with rice and green peas. Easy on a weeknight. Recommend baking covered to keep moist, and check after 10-15 mins. My two filets were done in about 18 mins.

I followed the suggestion to saut√© the garlic rather than sprinkle it on raw. I believe this makes a big difference in the overall harshness of raw garlic. The flavor is a great balance between the lemon and garlic. I took it one step further and sprinkled a panko/butter topping on the fillets before baking adding a welcome crunch to the delicate fish beneath. This is a great little recipe that is quick and easy to put together, and pretty much guaranteed to please the taste buds of picky fish eaters.

I prepared this with just 2 tilapia filets and about 2/3 of the spices required. I cooked it for the required time and it was delicious! Note that I am not that much of fish lover and have never actually cooked fish before. But despite that this dish turned out pretty amazing. Thank you for this basic recipe!

Didn't make any changes but next time I think I might add a little salt.  It was rather bland.  It was quick and easy to make and went well with baked sweet potato and brussel sprouts.

Best fast lunch!! I cooked for 20min on 400 and added olive oil and lemon-pepper instead and turned out great. 
Added some asparagus in the tray and cooked evenly also in the same time.

I saut√©ed the garlic and butter before baking the tilapia. I think the cook time was too long. It came out a bit dry. I also used lime instead of lemon because it‚Äôs what I had on hand.

This recipe has become a staple in my recipe rotation. The recipe is quick to fix and tasty. This is a low sodium recipe where you do not miss the salt.

The only modification I made was to use fresh parsley from my garden in place of the dried. Very tasty and a nice, light, summer meal.

I'm not sure if it was the tilapia I bought or what but this was lousy.  The lemon way overwhelmed everything. I have another recipe from Tidewater On The Halfshell that is outstanding. Although it calls for 1/2 stick of butter with the white wine & lemon. Has bread crumbs, parmesan cheese & paprika sprinkled on top. It's always a hit.

It smelled delicious while baking. I'm not a fish fan, but my picky 12 year old loves it so we tried it. It was AMAZING! We both ate all of it and agreed to make it again next weekend!
I made it according to recipe only substituting garlic cloves for powder. However, I didn't cook it for 30 minutes. Fish cooks very quickly and 30 minutes would have over cooked it. At 15 minutes it reached 150 degrees.  I guess it would vary by ovens...use a thermometer!

My boyfriend and I absolutely LOVED this recipe! I followed the recipe to the T, however this only cooking for two I only 2 tilapia fillets. I bought fresh fillets from a local Weis (they always have the best fresh fish selection) This was a very simple and fast recipe to follow and make. I served it with a hot load of bread, baked asparagus with olive oil, pepper, and salt, and Knorr's Garlic and Herb Rice. Will definitely be making this again!

ok this might be one of my favorite quick fish recipes the flavor is great and not over powering at all. I found it to be a perfect balance between the seasonings and the fish. I will definitely be making this one again soon.

My Sauce was a Garlic Butter Lemon Sauce ( 2 Cloves of Garlic, 4 Tablespoons of Butter , 1 Tablespoon Fresh lemon Juice - Did Not Use ALL of the Sauce ). I Lightly Sprinkled Salt and Pepper over the Tilapia. For the Seasoning I Used McCormicks  Italian Season Blend Grinder. I used a 9 X 13 Pan, No Grease or Butter BUT I Did Use a Parchment Paper as A Liner. I made it for my mom ( she Grew Up Frying  ) and she Liked It A Lot, She Wants It Again. To the Cook who First made and Posted this Recipe, Thank You.

My hubby, who is not a big fish eater, LOVED this dish.  I knew I would love it, but wasn't really sure about him.  Like many others suggested, I sauteed the minced garlic in butter and added dill weed, because, hey, its fish.  My fillets were frozen, and didn't cook in the 20 minutes they were in the oven, so I finished them in about 3 minutes in a fry pan, and THEN added the citrus for a brisk flavor.  He wants it again soon.  Recipes like this are important to me because I am on a doctor-prescribed diet that limits salt as much as possible.  I am having to learn again how to cook.  This did not lack any flavor that salt might have added.  It is delicious.

I only cooked my filets for 15 minutes and that was 5 minutes too long and they were overdone.  I'll try again and go with the 10 minutes but the writer of this recipe should re-evaluate the cooking time for fish filets. There's no way 30 minutes is called for, for any kind of fish filet.

I don't like any type of fish besides fried whiting, but I tried this recipe for my husband and he loved it! It was perfect! I did not use the parsley flakes at all because it wasn't in my pantry... but, I added a little bit of granulated garlic powder, lawrys seasoning salt and fine chopped up onions and wrapped it in the foil and baked it for about 40 minutes and served it with a side dish of mixed vegetables

Wonderful recipe! My whole family loved it! Updated it using local ingredients since Tilapia and parsley are not common here. Used Corvina, a mild fish caught off the coast where we live in Ecuador and Cilantro. Delicious.

Excellent and very easy to make.  Next time I would increase the butter or decrease the lemon.  The balance wasn't quite right for my taste buds but still it was excellent.  Also,  needs a good dash of salt.

I used Dill weed instead of Parsley and added some chopped tomato across the top at plating. It's a keeper and I definitely will make it again. A feast for the eyes and the palate.

I made this today!, I don't really like fish but this was delicious .... the only thing I changed was the garlic, instead I put garlic powder, and also the cook time was 20 mins and I followed what someone mentioned in the comments, I let the tipalia sit with the butter mix for 20 mins.

The taste was good - I upped the garlic and added some Old Bay seasoning to create a crust on top of the filets. It would have been perfect, but the 30 minutes at 375 dried out my ends leaving on the very center of the filet to be enjoyed. 

I will make this again, with a shorter bake time.

Nice recipe. I liked the  butter sauce combined with garlic which I was out of fresh so I added garlic powder for the flavor, the parsley was a pretty and tasty addition to the fish. Mine was frozen and it baked up nicely in the same time. I used sea salt and fresh ground pepper and it made it perfect! With a side of Maple glazed carrots!

Very good! Easy! Made exactly as recipe listed. Except doubled everything since used 9 small tilapia filets for family of four- 3 filets were only about 5 oz. Baked 15 min only. My 9 year old son ate two helpings and said he loved it and that's rare for fish. Keeping this recipe!

I made this tonight for my Chief. I've never been good at cooking fish. This turned out AMAZING! It was so moist, tasty and NOT overdone. So easy, so tasty and SOOOOO GOOOOD!! I also threw some extra chicken tenderloins that were left over from a larger package. They all cooked together and came out wonderful.

It was good but it tasted a little fishy (I know that sounds crazy, but I just don't like strong fishy taste).  I cover all my fish when cooking, so it was moist not soggy.  When it was finished I topped it with extra lemon juice.  To me it had a nice zing to it with the extra lemon juice and I enjoyed it very much then.

I did. I don't eat Tilapia anymore. Too many negative comments on it. I used Salmon filets. It was delicious! Served it with Basil Pesto Spaghetti and steamed broccoli and carrots, crusty garlic bread & White wine.  Yum ,Yum Yum. Thanks. Extra Parmesan shaved cheese too.

I hate it when people review a recipe and they did not follow the recipe and did their own thing, to me that is not a fair and accurate review.  Well, don't yell at me, but I followed this recipe exactly but out of habit when we have fish I added a little bit of Old Bay seasoning.  This recipe is great, the fish turned out fantastic; it was moist and flaky and hubby loved it.   We will certainly have this again and again.

Very easy and delicious. After pouring the lemon juice over the fish and seasoning them with salt and pepper, I added the remaining ingredients to the melted butter, including a little dill weed, and brushed it onto the fillets. Turned out very tender and tasty.

Like some others I used garlic powder instead of the real thing even though I had some.  Just being lazy.  I also was taken aback when I saw 30 for such thin fillets and only left mine in for 12 minutes.  Perfectly done.  Would have been stiff as a board after 30.  Otherwise made as directed.  Turned out very good and even pleased my wife who is generally not a big fish eater.

Super easy to make.  I may have added a bit more lemon juice but it was delicious.  A definite keeper.

Very good, light fish recipe.  Made it according to the recipe, except for cooking the garlic in the lemon and butter sauce.  Served with brown rice, salad, and sauvignon blanc.  Will definitely make again.

I wish I had read the reviews, it definitely needed salt. Also in an attempt to eat healthier I eliminated the butter and did not consider adding the olive oil (maybe next time). The recipe was ok. I mixed the garlic, lemon, and parsley in a bowl before scooping it onto the fish. The fish came out flakey, but a bit bland. The dried parsley was meh... I will try the recipe again with improvements: more salt, fresh parsley. I served this with saffron rice with peas and carrots, and a salad. The fish was ok, the meal as a whole was nice.

Easy and delicious!  I eyeballed all of the amounts and used garlic powder.  Wrapped each fillet in a foil pouch to make cleanup a cinch.

Pretty good. I doubled the Lemon because I love lemon on fish but other wise a good tasting fish. I also upped the oven to 450, put them in foil and cooked 20 minutes to not over cook. In fact, I would lower that to 16-18 next time.

Liked it, but loved it with tips from MommyFromSeattle about saut√©ing butter, juice & garlic first. Second time I made this I didn't measure a thing and it turned out better than the first and I even forgot the dried parsley. Use however much lemon juice or garlic you like.

Meal came out very flavorful. Made it for my boyfriend and he loved it. Because I like to thoroughly season any type of meat/fish, I also added paprika and garlic powder to the fish before topping it with the butter, garlic and lemon juice. Also, I would recommend using a little less lemon juice, depending on how much fish you are making because it can leave a bit of a tart taste. I also recommend flipping the fish midway to ensure both sides are cooked the same.

I had to rate this, because my 17 month old grandson gobbled it up like it was the best thing he'd ever had!  (The rest of us liked it too!). The only change I made was to saut√© the garlic in the butter before adding the lemon juice and then pouring the sauce over the fish; oh - I very lightly sprinkled the filets with creole seasoning from this site, and patted it in prior to pouring the sauce over.  My daughter-in-law also liked it, and she's not a real fan of fish, other than salmon and shellfish.  We will make this again!  Thank you for a nice - and simple - recipe.

I thought this was a great recipe! My boyfriend and I are extremely picky fish-eaters, so we used fresh tilapia from the market! I listened to some of the reviews and cooked the garlic, butter, parsley and lemon juice in a pot before drizzling it over the fish. It tasted much better than I thought it would, however it felt like it was lacking in more flavor. I added extra salt/pepper on top and it was a hit.

Excellent!  Easy, fast and healthy.  Husband liked it and it will be one of my favorites for tilapia.  I made this exactly as stated here.  I also do pan seared tilapia dusted in flour with lemon and butter served with habanero pineapple sauce on the side.

I've been making this one for years & love it.  I do think that the cooking time is to long for the 375 Temp.  I normally cook mine @ 325, but there is elevation  factor & weight to take into account.

Lemon Garlic Tilapia Haiku: "Well, this was easy! And it's such a boring fish. Lemon garlic yum." I arranged a frozen bag of broccoli & cauliflower along w/ a chopped red bell pepper for color around the tilapia filets while they baked. This couldn't have been easier, and everybody ate it up w/ no complaints. Of course, butter + lemon + garlic + parsley = classic fishy flavors!

I have made it before and it is good.  I do take exception on what was said about farm raised tilapia.  I am very familiar with the production of this fish.  While I haven't knowledge of every fish farm, but I am doubtful of what has been said.  If the person has PROOF of what he claims he needs to report it to the Department of Agriculture,  if he is just repeating bar talk, he needs to shut up!

I make it like the recipe called for however I am extremely lazy and  don't currently have a dishwasher, so  I lined my baking sheet with aluminum foil. which worked like a charm. I also did not use nearly the called for garlic I used a smidge, and added crushed red pepper flakes and a little tomatillo-jalapeno hot sauce  to give the fish a little umph I also did not use the called for salt instead I sprinkled little with kosher salt and then with seasoning salt. and baked per instruction. So Good!

I made this with one filet so used a little less than a teaspoon of butter. I like to use a little olive oil spray on the fish so I can use less butter.   I also added salt and pepper before putting lemon juice, butter, and garlic.  Very, very good.  I will be making again.  Served with roasted broccoli and was delish and healthy!

This was very good after I made some of the suggested changes: 3 cloves of garlic, 3-4 tbsp olive oil, 2 tbsp lemon juice. Before pouring it over the fish, I saut√©ed the mixture. I sprinkled salt, pepper, parsley, and a little pepper flakes on both sides of the fish, poured the mixture over, and baked it at 400 degrees for 15 minutes.  Came out perfect.

Rating the recipe as 2 stars only because the amount of ingredients for butter and lemon are reversed. Also, there is no indication as to the size of the filets for the recipe (4oz, 6oz, 8oz). 3 tbsp of  lemon with 1 tbsp of butter would result in an overpowering lemon flavor. I used 3 tbsp of butter, and 1 tbsp of lemon juice with four 5-6 oz filets and the flavor was OK.

Great recipe to build from! I subbed in Sunflower oil for the butter and added some diced bell pepper and doubled the garlic. I'll definitely be trying it again with other similar toppings too.

Since I found this recipe, I don't prepare tilapia any other way. We have this about twice a month and it's the only way my husband will eat fish. Great formula!

I followed the modifications of saut√©ing the garlic, and it was a little bland for my taste. My boyfriend on the other hand said it was stellar. I'll make this recipe agian though.

I HATE FISH! Had to get that out of the way before saying that this is the most amazing fish I've ever had. I cook fish for my husband and youngest child since they love it but always have to choke it down, literally. Not this time! Wonderful flavor and super easy (I followed recipe exactly). Will definitely be making again!!!

I think this is excellent. I did scale up the garlic (2 cloves), the butter (an extra pat), and the lemon juice (to 1 tablespoon per filet). I also followed a review suggestion and saut√©ed the garlic in the butter. I may leave out the extra butter next time, and I may leave the garlic raw before baking. I suspect it will still be excellent within those possibilities.

Delicious and so easy to make! Family loved this dish. I took some advice from the reviewers here and increased the garlic to 3 cloves for 4 fillets, and sauteed the garlic before putting it on the fish. Next time I need to try sauteing the garlic in the butter and lemon mixture before pouring it on the fish. :) Thank you~

I will definitely make this again. I used EVOO in place of butter and lightly saut√©ed the garlic in the EVOO and then poured it over the fish. I also lightly salted the fish. It was delicious.

Thoroughly enjoyed this meal. Followed other reviewers and sauteed garlic in butter and added lemon juice. I did season the fish well and allowed to stand for about 10 minutes.  Baked at 400.

Didn't really add any taste to the tilapia, and I even doubled the garlic, as other reviews suggested. I don't know if I did it wrong or if tilapia usually tastes this way, as it was my first time eating it, but it wasn't enjoyable. Tasted plain. Not planning on making this one again. I'll have to try a different recipe with stronger flavors.

So flavorful! Husband isn't fond of seafood other than tuna, but he finished his entire plate and I could hear him saying "mmmmm" in the midst of eating. Will make again for sure.

My son (20months) and I loved this recipe as is. He loves fish and I've been learning how to cook it. This is a keeper and I can't wait to try the variations that I've seen listed. A great starter recipe for amazing dishes to put your own twist on.

pretty good except most of my marinade came off the tilapia while it was cooking. despite that the flavors were pretty good. it needed more salt for my taste. i paired it with salsa i made.

Great recipe as is! To make it even healthier I used about 1 teaspoon olive oil per fillet. I also used  fresh parsley. My fillets were frozen so I made foil packs and 30 minutes was perfect. Brown rice and steamed broccoli rounded it out. Sauce was yummy!

Tried it couple times. First time, I followed the recipe to the T. It was delicious. The critiques  (my toddlers) loved it so much. The basically licked the plate. 
Second time, I didn't have parsley, but I followed the rest of the recipe. It was still yummy.
Third time, still didn't use parsley. But I foiled each fish and add shitake mushrooms as the veggies. It was delicious. 
I also tried it with salmon and halibut. I will not change the recipe. Fast, easy and delicious. What more can you ask?

Super easy, quick and yummy. I did mine a bit differently; I substituted capers for parsley. Also, do not bake for 30 minutes. I eat Tilapia all the time, usually is done after about 15 -17 minutes on 360;  it came out just perfect.

I used Pacific wild cod instead of tilapia.  Based on other reviews, I saut√©ed the garlic briefly in the butter.  I also baked it at 400 degrees for about 14 minutes, since the cod filets were thin.  Turned out perfect!

OMG! This recipe is the best!  I substituted tilapia for swai, because that's all I had and it still turned out perfectly. I paired it with roasted parmesan asparagus, and devoured it. I didn't take a picture because I ate it so fast. Lol!

I absolutely LOVED it!!! I just looked at what the recipe called for and then I just put the ingredients on without measuring, so I just made the amount of the ingredients up. It is an amazing, light and easy seafood dinner that goes well with rice. My family devoured all of the fillets, and I had like 18 of them!

10/21/2015  UPDATE:  Made it again for friends over for dinner.  It again went over extremely well.  

ORIGINAL:  My husband and daughter loved this.  Because I like things easy, I put the margarine, garlic powder, lemon juice, and parsley right along with 3 frozen tilapia fillets into a covered casserole dish that just held the fish.  I doubled the sauce ingredients as they wanted a sauce to put over their brown rice.  Cooked it for 30 minutes and it was perfect with the rice and stir fried veges. Definitely will make again.

good recipe...added chili powder to the fish as a previous reviewer stated.  Also increased the amount of butter to 4 tablespoons, 2 tablespoons lemon juice.  Since I didn't have fresh garlic, I used garlic powder which was just as good

This recipe is amazing!  I am trying to incorporate more fish into my diet and wanted a simple recipe to try.  I was afraid this was going to be too plain and the meal would be too fishy tasting, but this was delicious!  I served it whith brown rice and some roasted mushrooms and asparagus. So tasty!

I did it differentlyPreheat oven to 375, Rinse tilapia fillets under cool water, and pat dry with paper towels. I seasoned the fish with chili powder, pepper, garlic (optional bc I used garlic cloves), lemon pepper (optional bc I used lemons), and parsley. Then I saut√©ed minced garlic, extra virgin olive oil, crushed red pepper and evoo. Place fillets in baking dish. The last 5 minutes I sprinkled Parmesan on it.

I'm not a big fan of Tilapia nor is my husband, but I took this recipe and added a little creole seasoning and sprinkled some Parmesan Cheese over the fillets. We were both very pleased with the outcome and will be making this again.

Nice, light and simple recipe, good for weeknights. I took the advice of someone else here and saut√©ed the garlic which made it nice and soft.

Definitely on of my favorite fish recipes of all time! Even the most anti-seafood guests I have had have enjoyed this dish... I usually add some sauteed onions and serve this with rice, broccoli & cheese, and decorate with parsley :).

I loved it and it was easy to prepare and make.  We love garlic, so instead of 1 clove garlic finely chopped, I did 3 coarsely chopped.  
It was gone before I was able to snap a picture.
As a side I made rice, diced peas and carrots then combined the sides.

This is just so easy.  The last time I made it, I just put a pat of butter on top of the frozen fish and sprinkled everything else on it to with a dash of seasoned salt.  Easy peasy.  Makes fish even more appealing.

This recipe, as many have said, is simple and delicious! My son is picky and loved it! My husband also loved it as well as impressed!  We live in an area that has multiple lakes. My husband grew up here fishing and is a very good cook, especially fish.  Definitely thumbs up!

Made this today.  Stuck pretty close to directions, but took a suggestion and saut√©ed garlic.  It was a bit bland for me.  Very light and went well with a spinach and mushroom salad.

I did not have parsley, so I changed the recipe a bit.  I saut√©ed the garlic with butter and lemon juice.  Then, I put the garlic and extra lemon juice over the top of fish, as well as some grated parmesan cheese.  I cooked the fish in tinfoil and broiled for the last 5 minutes!  It was delicious!

DO NOT BAKE FOR 30 MIN!!! It took around 10-15 minutes to bake. Now that's out of the way, this was a really tasty recipe. I added more lemon juice so the whole fish in the baking dish was in the juice and butter but not swimming in it. I also added onions, ~4 cloves of garlic, and red pepper flakes which added some bite to the fish. I sauteed the onions, garlic and butter and poured it on to the fish.

Added an extra clove of garlic, but it was still just a tad under-seasoned for my taste-- still completely edible, and tasty!  Mine was done in 20 minutes instead of 30, though, so watch out for that.

I think I will definitely be trying this recipe again!  It goes really well on a bed of garlic butter rice (I used the Cajun Sides mix).

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe but did not find the flavors quite strong enough for my liking. I substituted mahi for the tilapia and soaked it in white vinegar and cold water first to get rid of the fish smell/taste. It's a good standard practice.

It was delicious but I did make changes as suggested by others. I increased the garlic (too much garlic? Never!) and saut√©ed it on medium heat in a generous helping of olive oil. I then added the butter to melt it and turned off the heat just as it was melted. I started with the tilapia on the 'wrong' side and put a little lemon juice, salt, black pepper and Mrs Dash lemon pepper. I then flipped it to the 'right' side, did the same thing but then poured on my butter, olive oil, garlic mixture and topped it with a genourous amount of finely chopped fresh parsley. Delish! Next time I will let it sit for a while before cooking. And I definitely agree - NOT half hour! I had biggish fillets which I cooked for 12 mins at 380F.

I followed the recipe word-for-word and it turned out great! We all ended up adding salt to our individual servings, so I might do that beforehand next time. My kids didn't even insist on tartar sauce. This one is definitely getting saved to my Recipe Box.

Added a couple of pinches of chili powder and cumin with a dash of salt...simmered all the spices with the Land O lakes Lite w/canola oil butter in a sauce-pan. Then drizzled lemon juice on pre-baked tilapia layed in sheets of foil. Lastly, drizzle seasoned butter on fish - then BAKE! Thanks to all who chimmed in their seasoning suggestions this was tasty and not too spicy or salty. I baked semi thin fish 12 minutes at 400 degrees. PERFECT!!!

I made this recipe without the butter and it was still delicious! Very juicy and flavorful. If you slice lemons and bake them on top of the tilapia it makes for great flavor

Delicious and easy after a busy work day. I used 3 cloves of minced garlic, 2T butter, added chopped fresh basil to the fresh parsley and a sprinkling of parmesan. I used a white fish similar to tilapia called balsa sold at our Target. We had the fish over rice. Yummy!

I enjoyed the recipe. I think I might have used too much lemon though.

Made this for dinner and it came out great!  Just made slight changes.  It was only two of us so I changed the serving size to two.  I did as others suggested and saute then garlic and butter, then sprinkled with dried parsley (didn't have fresh).  I used a half tbsp. more garlic than suggested.  I used lemon concentrate and coated each tilapia filet.  I then brushed the garlic butter over each filet, then sprinkled pepper and salt on.  I cooked in foil at 400 for about 15 minutes and served with lemon wedges.  Boyfriend approved! :)  Will use again!

I'm not a fan of Tilapia, so I tried this recipe with Striped Bass (a great quality, mild tasting white fleshed fish!).  Even using my favorite white fish, this recipe was so-so.  Sorry, I don't get what the rave reviews are all about. I won't be making this again.

I have made this twice now for the family. No leftover and clean plates. I will put this on the menu regularly. I used butter the last time and it was good. However, I like the healthy olive oil version better.

I've been trying to eat healthier and this recipe is a weekly staple at my house now! So easy to make, such a great flavor! I, too, use the foil pocket method and I love being able to use the leftover juice on a side of rice. Mmm!

I loved the simplistic nature of this dish. I like trying the dish as recommended, then making the dish again with a few twists recommended by others here in the review section.  I would use my garlic press for the garlic then saute the garlic in the butter and lemon juice.  I would also use less lemon than butter, add some creole seasoning and then grill the fish.

A bit bland, and thank goodness for the comments saying to cook it for only 10-15mins. The fish came out perfectly then. Next time I'm gonna try seasoning it a little more.

I did add onion powder, smoked paprika, cajun seasoning and lemon slices.  I omitted the butter due to my diet.  I wrapped the tilapia in foil pouches cooked it on the grill 4 minutes each side.  Then poured the juicies from the foil pouches over rice.  It was awesome.  When my youngest son asked me to make it again I knew it was a keeper.  Thank you!

I used Earth Balance dairy-free butter, and sauteed the garlic in the "butter" before putting it on the fish.  It was good!  A light flavor, maybe a little too lemon-y for me but my husband liked it!

Loved this recipe! My husband is not a fan of fish but even he loved it! I will probably do less lemon juice next time and saute the garlic as it was too strong even after baked. Great easy recipe!

LOVED THIS RECIPE! I should have made more. It was so simple but soooo tasty! My 7 year old daughter ate all of her fish and then asked for some of mine. The sad thing is I was pretty reluctant to give up part of mine. LOL! Will definitely be making this one again and again. Thanks!

This is the first tilapia recipe I've ever attempted and it was great! It was simple, fast, and cooked in about the same time the rest of my family made Kraft mac and cheese! I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

A superb treatment of this or any fish, but for finishing the dish, be sure to drizzle the baking juices over the fish!  Nothing there but garlic, butter, lemon and spices after all!

This was great. Only thing I did different was to add some parmesan cheese to the mixture. I mixed everything in a bowl and then poured it over the fish. Will make again!

Good but not great.  I made it in the oven so will have to try it on the outdoor grill next time.  I have a feeling that will add more flavor.  Still it was an easy meal to make in a pinch!

I do not eat fish so I have never cooked it.  I decided not to deprive my family any further so I decided to cook this for them.  Very simple, and they loved it!  My problem was I didn't make enough of it they devoured it!  I did cook it in a foil packet which helped!  I cooked it before church and they ate it afterwards and it warmed up perfectly each in its own pouch with its own juice and seasoning.  I did season them prior to cooking as well.  I will definitely make this again my family loved it!

I'm just starting to dive into the fish world and this recipe was really quick and easy.  I substituted fresh dill for the parsley, as well as olive oil for the butter.  Simple and delicious!

I'm not a big fish eater, as I get totally disgusted if it tastes even a bit...well fishy.. This is great and easy to prepare. As a new wife just figuring out how to cook, I appreciate that. My husband works pretty late sometimes and he's hungry when he gets home, this was an easy delicious meal to make especially since we wouldn't be eating till about 11 at night. I did follow the suggestions to do it in foil packets. Also I had no fresh garlic cloves so I used some minced garlic instead and added a little bit of the liquid that that comes in.

WONDERFUL DINNER! I did as LULU suggested below, except mine actually marinated overnight and it was amazing. I served it with rice and green beans, even my 2 year old loved it!

The first time I tried this recipe, I followed it to a T. An excellent recipe that allows the flavor of the fish to come through beneath the flavorings. I went light with the black pepper, as I'm not a pepper fan. I also used the chopped, fresh garlic like the recipe suggests.

The second time I fixed it, I left everything the same with the exception of reducing the tablespoons of lemon juice due to a smaller serving size to 2 tablespoons instead of three. I had a filet that was really two servings, but it could have easily used all 3 tablespoons. I also substituted lemon pepper for the black pepper and added some fresh lemon zest once the fish came out of the oven. Once again, fresh chopped garlic and dried parsley flakes, but all around a DELICIOUS recipe.

Excellent!!! I did use 3 tablespoons of butter and 3 cloves of garlic and sauteed them as recommended by others. I then broiled it for the last two minutes and grated a bit of Parm. cheese. My 1 1/2 year old loved it as well as the other kids. So yummy and so easy!

I made this for my husband and he did love it. I did make some alterations, as suggeted by others. I added more garlic, added half butter & half olive oil, and cooked for about 15 minutes at 400.  I will be making this for my husband again.

This was delicious.  I used cod instead of tilapia that is what I had on hand.  I never know how to make fish so I get it when I eat out.  This was better than any I have had in restaurants. Next time I will try tilapia.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was good and much better for you but felt like it was still missing a little something. Maybe more lemon juice since I like lemom flavor.

As others have done, I "tweaked" this recipe a bit. I used 4 T. butter, 2 T. fresh lemon juice, 2 t. crushed garlic & 1 t. fresh parsley for the sauce. Melt the butter in a small skillet on low heat; when melted, whisk in the lemon juice, garlic & parsley. I sprinkled the fillets (both sides) with Chef Paul Shrimp Seasoning (NOT just for shrimp!); then poured the sauce over; then sprinkles with approx. 5 or 6 crushed Ritz crackers. Baked at 400 degrees in 13 x 9 pan for exactly 10 minutes.  FABULOUS!!!

Generally speaking, this is a bland fish.  The recipe was good with it, but still nothing exciting.  Can't blame the recipe though, I'm sure it's just because the fish itself is boring.

This was a flavorful and tasty way to fix the same old fish. I had trouble with mine drying out a bit, as the cooking time was longer than i needed. I used all ingredients as stated, and it turned out yummy.

It was okay.  I found it to be a little bland and without much flavor.  Unfortunately, I don't have much of a solution either.  It's fish, so maybe it's just a fish thing.

Made this twice now and my boyfriend's eye's still light up with I talk about this dish. Best tilapia dish I've tried yet, and my second best was the Broiled Parmesan Tilapia recipe on this site.   I did not cook it as long the second time however, the first time the fish was just a little over cooked, although still very tasty. I cut 20 min off the recipe's cooking time and had much more juicy fish.

I loved it - very simple flavor. Best for those who really like fish, as my husband said it was too fishy and needed more flavor. (The tilapia we used did seem to be a little stronger flavor than usual.)

Oh.. My.. GOODNESS!!   This was the best fish I have ever had!  I've tried fish lots of different ways, and could never even choke down any fish that wasn't fried.. thank goodness you were sweet enough to share this!!  My hubby is trying to lose weight and I'm trying to lose a little baby fat and this will DEFINATELY be a favorite, even when we're done dieting!!  I LOVE this!  Thank you sooo much!!  **The only thing I changed was I didn't have garlic... But it would have been even better if I did!!

After all the rave reviews, I just found this OK.  It was fairly bland.  I did increase the garlic to 3 cloves but it just wasn't enough.  There was nothing wrong with it, it's just nothing special.

I made this last night.  I added extra garlic, a little less lemon and made sure that I had more butter than lemon.  I also sprinkled some bread crumbs on top.  This was quite good and decently healthy also!  I cooked it at 400 degrees for 12 minutes.

This fish dish has been a regular staple in our house since I found it on here a few months ago.  My kids doesn't like fish all that much but they all LOVE this dish.    I always make extra sauce to pour om the rice and veggies.

I took suggestions from another reviewer about having more butter than lemon (my ratio was 2:1) and raising the temp to 400 and cooking for 10 minutes. I also reduced the butter by about a tablespoon. Awesome and quick. Will make again!

I really liked this recipe. So simple and so good! I added frozen broccoli to the pan in the last 15 minutes or so. I dont eat fish very often and hate it when it tastes too "fishy"...this was perfect!

Very good.  I followed suggestions from others.  I sauteed the butter, garlic, parsley, and lemon juice ahead of time.  I used chili powder on the fish; I feel it would be too bland without it.

For two servings of this recipe, I used two T. butter and one T. lemon juice instead of the recommended amounts.  I seasoned the fish with salt, pepper and a touch of paprika prior to cooking for ten minutes at 400¬∞.  I served this with couscous and spinach.  This seemed like a good tilapia recipe that could also be used with other types of fish.

I found it to be too bland for my taste.  Usually I squeeze lemon over each piece and cover with lemon pepper.  It has more flavor with less effort.

Great, simple recipe that rendered a fabolous fish. Like others, I also added the garlic and lemon juice to the butter while heating it up on the stove; then drizzled it over the fish. My kids hate fish, but they ate this. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I found this recipe to be a bit heavy on the lemon and garlic.  I made it with the lemon as listed, but bumped the garlic to 2 cloves per some other review I'd read.  It's too much.  I also sauteed the garlic in the butter for a couple minutes before adding the lemon juice & parsley, then pouring it over the fish.  I think halving the lemon & garlic would be more appropriate for the delicacy of a fish like tilapia - especially if you're using very thin filets like the ones I had (the ones that come in 4 oz portions vacuum sealed in plastic).  I'll definitely try this again with less 'oompf'.  I may have to find some other liquid to make up for the decreased lemon juice.  Maybe white wine or water?  Maybe use lemon zest instead of lemon juice?  Hmmm...

I chose this recipe because it looked easy, healthy and I had all the ingredients on hand. Husband gave it 5 stars but I gave it 4. I think this is a good standard recipe, but I'll probably try another the next time I'm looking for wow factor.

Yum! This was so simple and very light and refreshing. I sauteed my garlic in the butter and then added the lemon juice and parsley to make sauce. I poured some of it over the fish before cooking and then drizzled the rest over this fish after I took it out of the oven. I cooked my fish at 400 degrees for 10 minutes and they came out perfect. This made a wonderful meal served with Roasted Potatoes with Greens (from this site).

The flavor was good, but I followed the recipe exactly and it was over cooked at 30 minutes. Next time, I'll follow the review recommendations and go for 10-15 minutes, but still a good recipe!

This is a very light and fresh dish!  I followed some of the other recommendations: sauteed the garlic in the butter before pouring over the fish, and only needed to bake it for 13 minutes. I also placed a slice of lemon over each filet. Very moist!

I also recommend not to bake so long. I baked the fish for about 15 mins and it came out great.Must say it was the easiest and quickest meal i have ever made!

I tried the recipe twice. Once as per the orignal recipe and another using some modifications that readers made. I like things with more kick so I used 3 cloves of garlic, more pepper, and some hot pepper. It definately helped with more zest.

Loved the flavor this added to my fish. I have used it for Tilapia and Halibut so far. Delish! I did cut back on the lemon slightly and increased the butter slightly. I also seasoning each side of the fillet with dash. Yum!

Okay... made this at a dinner party w/ other entrees.  Half and half around the table.  Half of the guests said it was very good and light tasting and brought out a nice flavor in the fish.  Other half said boring, no flavor, needs more to it.

This was the first time I had made or eaten tilapia and this was a great recipe! I used a little bit of olive oil instead of butter for health reasons and because I love the flavor of olive oil. This is a keeper!

We aren't big fish eaters, but this was a big hit at our house! I used a lot of garlic and more butter, then lemon juice.  I also sauted the garlic first and baked for 10 minutes.  Excellent! Will make again!

I made this recipe with catfish and baked it. It was a bit bland. Maybe more seasonings or grilling over charcoal instead of baking would improve the taste? I also cooked it for only about 8 minutes. 30 minutes is far too long for any size filet.

This was pretty good.  It needed more salt + 30 minutes at 375¬∞ was too long and the fish was overcooked.  I subtituted a bit of olive oil for the butter and added some zest as well as juice from the lemon.  I will make this again, but with changes because it's an inexpensive meal that is healthy & quick to make.

This recipe is great on those hot summer days when you don't want something heavy. However, I just make it on the stove top in a bigger pan. That way it takes much less time, and the oven isn't on for so long when it is already hot outside!

I wasn't big on this at all but my bf loved it.  I wasn't a fan of the texture, and would have preferred some sort of crispness to it. And I followed the advice of others, adding more butter than lemon - I think it would have been better had I stuck to the original, but then again I really enjoy lemon. I will try again, using the original recipe and broiling it as opposed to baking it.  I really wanted to like this on account of how easy it was.

This recipe was very mediocre. I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be really bland and I even added extra garlic.

We eat tilapia a lot and for some reason our pallets didn't agree with this recipe.

Really great and easy recipes.  I doubled the butter/garlic/lemon sauce to give more flavor, and I lightly dredged the tilapia filets in seasoned bread crumbs.  Came out great, and I will definitely make it again.

My husband said that the fish itself was great tasting but he couldn't taste the garlic or lemon even when I increased the original amount (I did saute the garlic and butter beforehand, I used 3 cloves of garlic, 3 tbsp of butter and 2 tbsp of butter as others had posted). I will probably not make again but will look for a different recipe that is similar with more taste.

Very, Very good.  I would suggest lowering the temperature by 10 degrees and letting it cook a little longer.  It wasn't quite as flaky as I'd like.

I'm not a big fish eater but this was great!  The sauce balances out the cajun perfectly...I found I didn't need as much sauce as the recipe made and would probably cut it in half next time but great flavors!

The husband and I thought that this was a bit too lemony.  I did sautee the garlic with a little butter and olive oil before drizzling over the fish.  I will definitely make it again though and just cut the lemon a bit.

Gave it 4 stars because I made a couple changes. I sauteed the garlic with the butter until the butter was a bit browned.. Then added the lemon juice and poured over the fish. I found that the fish needed salt, otherwise it was just plain bland. Pretty good.. although I doubt I'll save this recipe because all you really need to know is how to make a lemon/butter/garlic sauce and bake fish with it. Thanks!

This was good, not my favorite, but my kids loved it therefore I'll average to 4.  To be fair, I do like a lot more spices/flavor in my recipes and so does hubby, but surprisingly the kids wanted it again.

Decent and very easy recipe, but I expected more flavor. I will definately try this recipe again, sauteeing the garlic in the butter and adding cayene pepper and parmesean cheese.

OMG, this was one of the best fish recipes i've ever eaten.  i followed some of the suggestions from other reviewers (added chili powder, cayenne and parmesan cheese) and used a bit more butter...i used cod because that's what i had in my freezer.  my husband thought this was great, too!  HIGHLY recommended and close to restaurant quality!!  i would give it more than 5 stars if i could!!

I honestly thought this would have more flavor. I followed the other users suggestions of first rubbing the fish with salt and pepper then to saute the garlic, parsley, butter, and lemon juice before pouring on the fish but it just didn't have as much flavor as I was hoping for. I think next time I'm going to try adding the fish in skillet after I saute the mixture and keep it there to cook in the flavor ... maybe that will help.

This recipe was okay -- kind of bland even though I cooked the garlic (3 cloves) in 3 tablespoons of butter before putting it on the fish.  This was edible, but not phenomenal.

I made this as a special dinner for my boyfriend prior to him going out of state for a few days. It was so easy to put together but came out really impressive. Definitely a good company or special occasion dish. I served it along with "pan-fried asparagus" from this site (the best side ever) that I added some mushrooms to towards the end of cooking. A really healthy and satisfying meal. The only thing I would change is maybe adding some crushed red pepper flakes to the fish while cooking. That would have made it a 5*. Yum.

This is great!  The flavor was a little strong right after I cooked the fish, but that's probably because I added extra garlic.  I ate leftovers today and the flavors were just perfect!  I also used lemon juice from a bottle since that is what I had on hand.  This is exactly the recipe I was looking for (I'm obviously not too creative on my own).

Made this for dinner tonight... It was pretty good.  I only had the fish in the oven for 15mins because the fillets were fairly thin.  I halved the recipe since I only fed two people.  I added more garlic and listened to others about roasting the garlic.  Next time I am going to leave the garlic raw.  Went well with brown rice and steamed zucchini.

Fantastic recipe! I did follow the advice from other reviews and I sauteed the garlic with the butter first. I also added 1/8 tsp. of Old Bay seasoning to the mixture before pouring it over the fish. Wonderful flavor.

I'm not a big fish eater but made this for my husband and I actually ate some too!  Loved the garlic/butter/lemon combo.  Hubby was very happy!

I enjoyed this simple-flavored fish dish.  Next time I may try adding some more or different seasoning to the lemon & butter.

I'm really not the best cook in the world, or even in my household, so the fault probably lies with me.  But I made this directly from the recipe and it was a bit too bland for our tastes.

Very Good, Very Moist. The baking with the sliced lemons penetrated the fish.
The nice thing about this easy recipe you can adjust the amount of seasoning
to your individual tastes. This would go with any seafood. Thanks

Easy and delicious! I followed others' suggestions by sauteeing the garlic and seasonings with the butter before drizzling it over the fish. I served it over a bed of fettucine with a very light sauce made of butter/olive oil, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, and other seasonings. It was soooo good and so easy to make and my boyfriend, who is not a big fish eater, thought it was really good too!

This was a delicious, quick, and easy to prepare recipe for tilapia.  The filets I purchased were fresh and quite thicker and larger than usual so I did bake them for the amount of time specified in the recipe and they turned out great.  I did use fresh parsley rather than dried.  I served the fish with oven roasted sliced potatoes and sauteed spinach.  My husband is not crazy about baked fish but he truly loved this dish.  This recipe is a keeper.

I made this twice using some variations.  The first time, I squeezed fresh lemon (used half of a lemon for 4 filets) instead of using bottle juice, and used pre-minced garlic.  I also substituted extra virgin olive oil in place of the butter.  The lemon seemed to hide most of the fish flavor.  The second time, I used bottled lemon juice, and it tasted very fishy.  Overall, this is a simple baked fish dish, and I will continue to make it with squeezed lemons or lemon slices on the filets.

This was pretty good!  I used halibut instead of tilapia, since it is what I had.  You can definitely tell it is healthy, because when I followed the recipe exactly, it was not quite as flavourful as it could have been.  I will probably make this again and use either fresh parsley, or more garlic, or both!

This was a great recipe.  I never tried tilapia before and was a little sceptical at first.  The lemon juice along with the sweet taste of the fish really compliment each other.  I will definately keep this receipe and use it often.  I can't wait until summer to try it on the grill.

Delicious and healthy.  I used my garlic crusher and crushed the fresh garlic, evenly spreading it on top of the fish.  I also used light butter (I always do, Kellers and Land O Lakes light butter is very good).  This, along with the lemon juice, parsley, and black pepper made for a very good meal that was also easy and quick to make.  I followed the baking time to the T, and it was perfect!!!

Delicious. I will definitely make this again. I followed some of the advice and used the amount suggested for four to make sauce for 2 filets. I also put salt and pepper directly on the fish and sauted the garlic first.

Super easy and very good.  I sprinkled with cajun seasoning and used evoo instead of butter.  Delicious!  I also baked at 400 for about 12 minutes.  This will be added to our regular rotation.

Didn't much care for this recipe.  Garlic was overwhelming.  Next time i would probably cook the garlic in the butter as suggested to mellow it out more.

Good recipe!  I think it needed a little less lemon.  It was a little strong on that.  I also added more butter than it called for and it could have used more garlic (well at least thats what the hubby said... I thought it was fine).  Overall this was a good recipe.  I think it would be good with chicken as well.

My husband loved it.  It tasted a little bland and next time I would pre-season the filets and then cover them in the crumbs.  I used lemon in a bottle but next time I will use fresh lemons. The filets were tender and I used the sauce over pasta.  If my hubby likes it, It's GREAT!

Yum.  I implemented the recommendation to saute the garlic in the butter, and got it just slightly carmelized.  It was delicious, easy and fast--a good weeknight dinner with a little more elegance than my usual menus.

This is great. I took the advice of a reviewer and used a little less lemon. Next time I think I'll use the full amount, it was just missing a little tang. My fault though. Excellent healthy recipe.

This recipe was very easy and delicious. I used 1 lb of tilapia baked at 400 for 10 minutes. I didnt have parsley so I used coriander instead. One mistake I made was squirting a last bit of lemon juice into the middle of the pan thinking that it would blend with the rest of the mix. It didnt and the fish in its immediate area was extremely tart :P

This was amazing!! I followed the other reviewers suggestions and did this: Cooked for only 7 minutes at 400 degrees.
Had a 2:1 ratio for butter & lemon juice.
Rolled filets in parmesan cheese prior to applying sauce.
Oh, and sauteed the garlic & butter prior, and added a pinch of cayenne pepper. Delicious!!!

I made this for dinner last night but I increased the garlic because I love them. I sauteed the sauce like suggested and poured it over the fish. YUMMY!!I loved it..When to the store today to buy more Tilapia to make it again soon. Thanks for the recipe.

My boyfriend liked it alot, I liked it okay. The strictly butter & garlic combo made me think of Red Lobster (not so great). Didn't have the parsley, but sprinkled with some original Mrs. Dash and parmesan cheese before broiling for 2 mins.

This came out great (although what wouldnt taste good drenched in butter and garlic). 
I salted and peppered the fish and broiled them plain for about 3 minutes. Then, popped them out and poured the lemon butter mixture over the top. (I sauted the garlic in the lemon & butter) I added a shake of parmesean cheese, and put them back in the broiler for about 3 minutes. Much faster and easier that way, and they came out excellent.

Excellent recipe!!! I fried it in butter and EVOO then sprinkled it with parsley and crushed rosemary after cooking.  The fish really absorbed the lemon and garlic flavor without being too overwhelming.

What an easy, delicious recipe!  Our whole family adores this dish, even the picky little ones, so much so that I made it the following week with lime juice - again a hit!  As per a different recipe, I poured a bag of frozen broccoli into the baking dish and laid the fish on top.  Baking time took aboout 5 minutes longer, but again, fantastic.  We served it with brown rice on the side.

Quick and easy
I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil instead of butter.  Super Easy meal.  Serve with bright colored vegetables, like corn and broccoli with sliced red peppers.

So easy and yet so good! The simple flavors compliment the fish very well. I followed previous advice and dredged the fish in the melted butter and poured the rest over it right before baking.

It turned out great!  I used frozen fish that had directions on the back of the pack to bake at 400 degrees for 30-32.  I don't know if the cut was thicker but it was very moist and flakey.  I used the juice from half a lemon as well as olive oil, old bay, garlic powder, parsley flakes and pepper.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This was delicious.  I covered the fish with old bay seasonings before following the recipe.  And like others, I only cooked for about 12 minutes.  Very tasty!

A good recipe. I sauteed garlic and onions and pour them on top of the fish. The sauteed garlic and onion just give it an extra zing.

So simple and so good! This will probably be the only way I make tilapia in the future. I squeezed half a lemon and it could've probably used more. Yummy!

Great Recipe and I've already made it several times.  If I don't have any garlic on hand, I use a garlic pepper blend instead.  Delicious...I also add parmesan cheese like others suggested.

I didn't have any lemon, so I used quite a bit of lemon pepper.  Let that sit on the fillets for about an hour & then poured the sauce over it & cooked.  It was really good!  Tilapia isn't my favorite fish, because it can be so bland- but this really was very good.  I'll be making this again!!!! *maybe with a few tweaks*

This was a good, easy way to make fish, but I had to put a lot of Parmesan on the top to give it more taste. Also, Salt and pepper.

I liked this a lot - and my husband did too.  I followed the directions exactly, but next time I may try the Old Bay Seasoning that other reviewers recommend.  We will make this again - so quick and easy and I had everything needed to make it on hand already.  Thank you!

Nice lite fish, added a little olive oil, Essence, onion powder, and kosher salt, with everything else specified in recipe. Served with baked Red potatoes I had started earlier at 400 deg., tossed in olive oil, kosher salt and fresh ground pepper, with side salad. Quick week nite meal.
