I used fat free egg substitute and fat free milk and ran the recipe through my Weight Watchers recipe builder and they came up to only 1 point per muffin!!  Very tasty muffins!

This recipe was not very good.  I added raisins. . . . thankfully, or they would have been tastless.  Pretty doughy tasting.  I won't make these again.

This recipe is ok as most low-fat muffin recipes are, perhaps better than most.  I would have liked having the nutrition information provided so I would know how many Weight Watchers points I was eating.

I added 1/2 c walnuts and 1/2 c raisins, and they are delicious! My husband can't seem to eat enough of them. We love to eat them warm with a little Parkay. We think they are moist, hearty and delicious. I will definitely be baking these again real soon!

I made these bran muffins today and they came out wonderfully delicious.  I used home made applesauce.  They were very moist and sweet.  I will definately make them again.

This is a terrific recipe.  You can add to it, things like raisins, apples or walnuts for a little something extra.  My husband is an anti-health nut, and he loved them!

These were very tasty but a bit tough.  I substituted the sugar by using 1/3 cup molasses and 3 Tbsp of Splenda to reduce the calories.

Excellent low fat muffins, some of the best I've had! I made a few modifications based on other reviewers. I used egg substitute, and raisin bran (2 1/2 c), increased the flour to 1 1/2 cups, and increased brown sugar to 2/3 cups. I also used a bit less than 1/2 c. of applesauce,  to make of the rest of the 1/2 c. used 3 tablespoons of veg. oil. (this added a bit of fat but not much) Will make again, they are a great breakfast or snack. Very moist and light.

These were quite good!  I used raisin bran instead of bran cereal.  I also used 1 single serving container of applesauce which is just 1/2 cup.  They stayed very moist with a yummy taste.

These muffins were yummy to my tummy. I mean it,they were really good. I added some raisins like others suggested and they were perfect. They were light and moist. I'll definitely be filing this recipe away for later use.

These muffins are very good.  I added 1/2 cup raisins as other reviewers suggested.  Since my daughter & I are both on Weight Watchers, these are great in that they're low fat & high fiber.  I'll be keeping these on hand!

FABULOUS!!  I've tried many bran muffin recipes and these are the best by far!  I stuck to the recipe but couldn't find the brand "Post" so I used a different 100% bran cereal.  Awesome, and my 2 & 4yr olds (and even picky DH) love them too!

Very good and great for breakfast.  I used skim milk and vegetable oil instaed of the applesauce ( none in the house ).  The muffins came out really good.  Great with a little bit of butter on them after being heated in the microwave!!  I'll try the applesauce next time.

Good recipe! I used 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and 1 tsp of nutmeg and they smelled great baking! I used paper muffin cups and they stuck to the bottom, so maybe it would be better to actually follow the recipe and grease a pan. :)

These are a nice change of pace for a healthy breakfast.  They are not the yummy zillion calorie muffins from your bakery. We preferred them made with walnuts.  I would make this recipe again.

I had never tried low-fat bran muffins before, but I did not care for these. I did add some cinnamon to the last batch and they were better that way. I don't think it is this recipe I did not like, per se, but I think it was the low-fat taste I did not care for. However, they were moist and baked up nicely.

In my personal opinion, the muffins were lacking in a bit of flavour, but otherwise, they are very good. (: Next time, I'll try adding some raisins or more cinnamon, as others have suggested.

The muffins stick to the paper cups, but are otherwise delicious.  I added chocolate chips to half the batter and they are yum!  Can also add raisins, etc.

The texture of these muffins is great.    A bit bland, though.  Maybe I will add more cinnamon next time.  Using skim milk and Total Raisin Bran this recipe has 80 calories, 5 calories from fat, 0.5 gm fat,  2.8 gm protein, and 1 gm of fiber per serving (yield 12).
