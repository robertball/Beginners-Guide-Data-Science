This is so yummy. Made exactly how written and my husband and I really enjoyed it.  It's got a kick along with a sweet punch.  Satisfies all tastes.  Next time I will made a batch with a little less chili powder because my 3 year old thought it was a little too "hot"   For adults, it's great!!!!!!!

Made this for a family reunion. I had an 8 lb. boneless pork butt, just fit into the slow cooker. I cooked it 4 hrs on high and then about 8 hrs on low. I had nothing left by the time everyone went through the line once. I took 2 dozen buns and they were all gone. I increased this recipe to serve 12 people. It was so easy and flavorful. I would definitely make it again.

A hit! Based on the comments of some reviewers, I omitted the brown sugar. I also added liquid smoke. Definitely a keeper!

Easy to make, but too sweet. I added a little vinegar to the leftovers and it made a big difference.

This was a hit with my family. I did a 3 lb pork loin in a slow cooker. Due to it's size , I doubled the listed ingredients and the cook time was 5 1/2 hours.  I used 1 18 oz Sweet Baby Rays  honey chipotle bbq sauce and another 18 oz just honey bbq by the same brand. Look forward to making it again.

This is WAY too much BBQ sauce.  All I could taste was BBQ sauce with some meat in it.  I think I would go with a recipe that doesn't use prepared BBQ sauce next time.

Too much sauce.  I doubled the sauce as I used 2+ lbs. of pork.  Pork was a little dry.  May be better to not cut up while in crockpot.

This was a very easy recipe and i loved it but next time i will omit the brown sugar as barbecue is already sweet, but will use hickory smoke flavor and add more spice, as i love spicy food.

Yummy! I never had this before, it was sooo good. Next time I will make it more spicy and probably leave out the sugar...a little too sweet, thus 4 stars.

Good recipe.......but WAY TOO MUCH SAUCE! I increased the servings to 20.....spiced it up some..plus used sriracha ketchup. later I had to spoon out half the sauce! Not bad. But if I use this recipe again I will cut the sauce in half!  AND! probly use pork shoulder rather than a loin.... the white meat tends to dry out more than I like......

I used 2.5 lb pork loin boneless and used 2C of BBQ sauce, didn't add to anything else and it was perfect. I put it on high for 4 hours and on low for the last 30-45 min until we ate it, and it was perfect.

Not sure if I qualify to rate this recipe because I just used it as a guide. I absolutely needed to cook a couple of small pork loin that I had defrosted and never had the opportunity to cook. I was also burned out on cooking after the holidays. I found this recipe, but I didn't have root beer or barbeque sauce. I did have Coke, so I cooked it in that, thinking that I would at least get it cooked, and I could get bbq sauce at some point. However, after I had cooked it in the Coke, it turned out so tender and good that my family wanted to eat it then and there, so we did. Turned out great. Next time I will be sure to have root beer and bbq sauce on hand, though. I will definitely make this again.

The best Pulled Pork recipe I ever made.  I used a combination of two of my favorite Barbecue sauces "Bulls Eye Honey Garlic Bonanza and Dianna Gourmet Honey Garlic".  The leftovers were even better the next day.

I made this recipe for a midnight snack for my wedding. It was delicious! I've been told by many people that it was the best pulled pork they've ever had. The only issue I had was that the pork to sauce ratio seems really high! I made enough to serve 75 people and so the recipe called for 18 pounds - I actually used 30. I also decreased the amount of BBQ sauce. I used about 2/3 of what it was called for which was 4 liters and it was still lots. Will keep this recipe! Thank you!

This is so good. Added a half can of coke but otherwise followed the recipe and it was perfect. Had fresh green beans and corn on the cob from the garden. What a great summertime meal. Thanks for sharing.

This was a phenomenal and easy recipe! I used a bone-in pork butt and divided it into 4 quarters. I followed the recipe exactly with my only substitution being sweet baby ray’s sweet and spice bbq sauce.

Really good a lil too saucy HOWEVER I read more of the reviews and decided based on what I read to go with a pork butt instead of loin. Wish I hadn’t of done that. When you think about biting into a pork sammy you kinda want that pull and the shred. The pork butt was chunky. Should’ve stuck to recipe and then decided on my own to switch my cut of meat. The only thing I wouldn’t do is add more brown sugar, I did not put this in my dinner only because bbq sauce is sweet enough and I felt if I had added the brown sugar it would’ve been too sweet. I also made a homemade coleslaw and topped off the sandwich with that and sharp cheddar. Love the recipe thank you !

So after reading a few reviews I followed the recipe except for the sugar,  the amount of barbecue sauce that I added, and used pork butt. I didn't add any sugar and I only put half the amount of sauce which is 3/4 of of a cup. When I was getting pork from the deli they said that the pork butt would be better so I used  that instead. I don't know if it's because the pork butt has more fat, I still found there to be extra sauce then I wanted. Next time I think I'll use only half a cup of sauce. I also pulled pork apart at the last 30 minutes which helped reduce the extra sauce. Other than that I thought they were pretty good

I live in Texas BBQ country, so I found this recipe to have too much sauce.  It was tasty, though, and I'll make it again, but with half the sauce, and no brown sugar.  To top the pork, I used shredded cabbage with a very light coating of cucumber ranch dressing, and slider buns for portion control.

Just as my tummy was imagining ... nice and tangy without any particular overbearing flavor.  I used Sweet Baby Jane's regular BBQ sauce with all other ingredients the same but maybe a little extra chili powder and a shot of Worchestershire.  Cooked on low for about 6 hours and was perfect.  Served on a mini French roll and with kale salad. Yum!
Definitely noted where to find the recipe again.

I had leftover cooked pork tenderloin, so I made the recipe a little different but with excellent results. I scaled it down to two servings, sauteeing the onion in EVOO for a few min. I then added the shredded pork, the ingredients listed, some garlic powder, and just a few pinches of the sugar (others mentioned it was too sweet with amount listed) and some water.  I only let it cook for about 5 min. Perfect on a half, open-faced bulkie roll with some coleslaw. So easy using the leftover pork and lots of flavor!

This came together quickly and was very good, although my husband thought it was missing something. I used 2 lbs of pork and only 1 cup of bbq sauce but kept the other ingredients the same. It was the perfect amount of sauce for us. I used my temperature probe setting because I was rushed for time and it was cooked in a little over 2 hours. Next time I’ll try leaving it longer.

Seems to me you'll love this if you pick a BBQ sauce you really like.  I found CattleBoyZ Chipotle Maple Bacon did the trick for our family.  Other reviewers are correct, I used about half the sauce.  It almost seems the recipe should call for 2lbs of pork and not 1lb.
Would definitely make it again.

I made it just as the recipe read and it was very very good. I had a lot of raw onions leftover from the chop and I like them, so I tossed them in.  If you want to save a little money, stay home from the high dollar restaurant and make this instead. Serve it with a good coleslaw or some potato salad and a few spears of dill pickle.  Mix it with some good company and improve your friendships. You will glad you did and so will your friends.

I had a 3.5 lb boneless port tenderloin, so I scaled this recipe to utilize that and made it in my InstantPot (pressure cooker). I cooked it on manual / high pressure for 60 minutes, then ended up cooking it about 20 minutes longer, as it wasn't quite pulling apart like I wanted it to. After that, I put the port in my KA mixer with the paddle attachment to shred it (that works really well, by the way). I fed 9 people, with plenty left over for another meal. Everyone liked it.

This is really good!  I followed the recipe with a couple exceptions..  I used a pork roast, omitted the brown sugar, and had to leave it in the crock pot for an extra 90 minutes, since the family had to run an errand...  It was awesome to come home to a tasty dinner, that only required a few minutes to pull the meat apart.  My husband even asked that this be made on a frequent basis, which is a rare statement for him to make...  This recipe is a keeper!

Great. Added 3 dashes jalapana  salsa, dash ground mustard , and Worcester. Cooked in cast iron pan with lid after searing meat on stove. Can keep warm in oven after shredding until ready to eat.

Delicious recipe, although next time I don't think I will add the salt, (there was plenty already!) or the ketchup. Maybe just extra bbq sauce.
