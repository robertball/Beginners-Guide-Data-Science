My wife and I have gotten into the habit of trying a new drink on weekends, something completely different from the classic gin martini I enjoy, and her favorite chocolate martini. My wife chose this for this week’s pick but honestly, when I looked at the ingredients I was a bit skeptical that this would come together and taste better than sweet swamp water.  Boy was I surprised!  It’s hard to describe how the flavors blend other than to say it was well-balanced and refreshing.  No one of the relatively different liquors included in this drink dominated the other. Other than using Grand Marnier instead of Triple Sec I followed the recipe as written. The only flavor that really stands out is the pineapple, and even that is pleasantly subtle and not too sweet.  This is a refreshing, not boozy, drink that can be enjoyed for just about any occasion.  But just a warning – depending on whether or not you really do stay up until dawn drinking this, one serving was plenty for the two of us!

Very good. I used vanilla vodka because that was all I had and squeezed the juice from the lime wedge into my drink. Took the edge off.

This is a large drink that is pretty potent.  You can barely taste the alcohol.  All I can say is if you can make it 'til dawn without passing out, you're doing good!

This is absolutely wonderful.  A nice, clean refreshing flavor.  Great balance, and use of all ingredients.
