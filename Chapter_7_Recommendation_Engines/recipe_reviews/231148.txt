Perfect!  Absolutely, positively the BEST method for tender, juicy beef or pork.  Awesome recipe! Thanks so much for sharing this with us bd.weld. The meat is tender, juicy and just perfect. I have a newer electric oven that vents too fast so I had to improvise - I cooked to 120 then I turned the oven to 170 - it's lowest setting and cooked until the internal temp was almost 130 - then turned off the oven and let it finish. Perfect! Thanks for sharing. UPDATE: I used this same method for pork loin - It was great! Perfectly cooked - fork tender and juicy. I wanted the final product to be 145 - my newer electric oven vents way too fast to shut it off entirely. Lesson learned - next time I will cook to 140 -142 and then shut it down and let it continue to come to the desired 145. I can't imagine making a better roast. Thank you again.

If you are looking for meat for sandwiches, you need look no further!  This method of cooking is the bomb!  I did purchase the thermometer the author of this recipe mentions, and it works just perfectly!  I cooked an eye of the round roast from Costco, but you could use any cut for this.  I turned off the oven when the meat reached 115, and when the temperature got to 130 I took it out. The meat was perfect for me, but my hubby and daughter both wanted it done just a little more, so I'll play around with that with the next roast. We ate it like a roast the first night, but now tonight we'll be having sandwiches. I don't have a meat slicer, but I was able to get it cut thin enough with a sharp knife. I'll do a horseradish sauce to go with the sandwiches (we love Frozen Horseradish Sauce from this site)! I can hardly wait! Thanks, bd.weld!

I had made this when it was a personal recipe and WOW!! I've never made an eye roast of beef that was ever this good, even DH commented how moist and tender it was. Method and instructions are well noted. We had some for dinner and are looking forward to sandwiches with the leftovers. Now I want to buy a meat slicer (I sliced it as thin and evenly as I could) because I know I will make this often. Thanks bd.weld! *** Note: my oven has a probe and once it reaches the temp set for the probe it turns off and so does the probe reading. so I would not have to open my oven door I had to turn my oven back on to the lowest setting and then program the probe to 140 degees (for medium) so I could get a temp reading but would then turn it right back off, worked great.

Reviewed on May 8, 2012 when this was a personal recipe: 

Fantastic! Followed the directions exactly, My oven has a plug in temp gauge but it does not continue to work once the set temp has been reached so I used a manual gauge as well. This took me to exactly 140 degrees. I let it rest a full 30 minutes and proceeded to slice into a perfectly cooked roast. I usually do the high temp recipe, here on AR, but BD's recipe allowed me to be more exact internal temperature. I seared my roast in a cast iron pan and deglazed with some Merlot wine I then served over the roast. I made two roasts so I can use the 2nd one for steak sandwiches later in the week. Thanks for sharing your recipe. Will definitely be using again! 3/27/13**** This is a go to recipe for me.  I have used it several times with continued success.****

When I saw the cooking method on this one, I knew I had to try it!   My roast was 3.5 lbs. just as called for.  I seared it for 4 minutes on each side.  I used a remote digital thermometer, which was perfect for this.  It took my roast 1 hour and 30 minutes to get to 115 degrees, and another 43 minutes to get to 130 degrees.  I allowed it to rest for 15 minutes, for a total time of 2 hours and 28 minutes.  I left the thermometer in and interestingly the roast only rose to 131 degrees during the 15 minutes of resting.  I was concerned it would be too rare but it was perfectly medium rare with a lovely pink center throughout!  I am delighted with this new method of cooking a roast and I’m anxious to try it on beef tenderloin.  Thank you bd.weld!

My Dad taught me this technique in the early 70s, and he called it "Hotel Roast Beef" because he thought it tasted as good or better than anything he ate while on business travels. He was way ahead of his time! Another trick..if your roast is frozen, just take off the wrapping, put it in a roasting pan (one with a rack is best) in the oven at lowest temp possible (usually 170) first thing in the morning and it will be perfectly done at the end of your work day! Tastes much better than a crock pot roast!

Caught a  bottom round on special for 1.99 lb so knowing that Central Market uses bottom round for their in house roast beef at 9.99 lb I decided to go for it. I used a center cut and trimmed and tied it for even cooking. I used sea salt this time and added 1 t each of onion and garlic powder.  I rinsed  that off after the overnight then seared and added cracked pepper and Herbs de Provence. The bottom round was not quite as tender and juicy but it was good enough to be delicious all the same and a bargain to boot. LOVE this recipe.

Thanks BD! I finally tried this. I didn't marinate with the garlic, just sprinkled the roast with garlic powder,s&p, browned it, put it on a rack and roasted. I did use a remote thermometer, but the feel of the roast after it reached temp was way too rare, so I turned oven back on and brought it up a little higher. Still a little too rare for me, but I can fine tune it later. I get a pretty fine cut with my knife for slicing up for sandwiches. Thanks again!

My oven cooks a bit hot, I have a meat thermometer similar to the cooks, and only took an hour to reach 115°F. After turning off the oven it took about another 40 minutes to reach 135°F, which was perfect for us. I did add some onion powder to the rub, was tender juicy and flavorful, and made great sandwiches. I wish I had a meat slicer now, we had to use a knife and cut as thin as possible, but couldn't get it as thin as some of the photos, something to add to my wish list for the kitchen. We put the remainder in the freezer in small serving size Ziploc baggies as the cook suggest for future use. A real money saver making your own lunch meat, and not all those preservatives. Thanks B.D. for the recipe...a real keeper.

Love, love love this simple roast beef. This is a go to recipe that I use for sandwich meats. This is especially good for french dip sandwiches. Superior to anything you get in a deli and much cheaper too! I bring the second temperature to 128 because we prefer it on the rare side. Thanks for sharing bd weld

Even though I had 3 oops with this recipe it came out excellent.  1st oops-grabbed the wrong cut of beef got a Top Round Roast.  2nd oops- meat thermometer didn't work so had to guess at internal temp.  3rd oops- my oven is cooking at least 25 degrees off so again guessed at my temp and time.  Even with that the roast was the best I have ever cooked, moist & full of flavor.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

Spot on! Absolutely perfectly roasted beef. I can't wait to try this roasting technique with other rubs (like olive oil, fresh garlic & rosemary like my hubby does his prime rib).  So good, my 13 year old son was stealing it right off of the slicer, and my dog was at my heals waiting for something to drop (LOL)! I used this to make Herdez Drowned Beef Sandwiches (also from this site).  Win-Win recipe combo!  Thanks bd.weld!

We loved this! I get two 3 pound roasts and have one for dinner with a brown gravy and one for sandwiches the next few days. I tried both ways - having s t with garlic salt overnight and also just putting it on before browning. Both taste the same. I do not have a thermometer with an external readout so I had to use my instant read and hope the times listed in the recipe were somewhat accuarate even if they were approximate. They were! Thanks so much!

This recipe is A-MA-ZING. I wasn't able to leave the seasonings on as long as requested, so we just baked it with everything on and we all fought over the leftovers of this one. Perfect for thin slicing and eating on sandwiches. Delicious!!

This method makes for an absolutely delicious roast. I used a venison roast for this and it was the best venison roast I had ever made. I patted dry the roast and rubbed with a light coating of oil before rubbing with a mixture of salt, fresh ground pepper, garlic powder and fresh rosemary. Followed the cooking method as directed. Perfection. I used the meat in the submitter's other recipe, HERDEZ® Drowned Beef Sandwich with Chipotle Sauce (Torta Ahogada) and it was delicious also! Thanks Brian for two keepers!

This turned out perfectly!  Followed cooking instructions exactly; the only thing I did differently was that I wet brined it instead of dry rubbing, and it turned out delicious.  Great roast beef sandwich recipe.

New territory for me.  I realized my meat thermometer doesn't have low enough temperature settings, and it doesn't have a cable.  So I had to guess, and keep opening the oven during the roasting process.  However, once I hit the target, and was able to shut off the oven and let the roast finish, it came out better than I expected.  It had a nice pink center and was delicious.  I also ordered a meat slicer right away...great investment.  The sliced beef is heavenly. We will make this every week as my hubby loves deli thin slice roast beef-and it is ridiculously expensive anymore!  Thank you be.weld!

OMGOODNESS GRACIUS!!!! ABSOLUTELY TO DIE FOR! Best roast beef I have every tasted, and so easy to make. We will be having this often, and especially when I get a meat slicer to slice into paper thin sheets to pile high on sandwiches. Mouthwatering goodness, I can go on raving forever about this, just go make it yourself, you won't be sorry.

Very good cooking method and great flavored meat. This would make wonderful Philly sammies. The man of the house said, "that's cooked perfectly."

I followed the steps exactly and it came out perfectly using the probe that came with the stove 13 years ago, that I've never used. Thanks to Linda (LMT) for the excellent directions for using said probe.  Thanks bd, you've got a real winner here.

FANTASTIC!  Nothing makes me happier than finding a recipe that I know I'll use over and over.  This is one!  I have been wanting to make this for a while now, but didn't have the right thermometer.  While shopping, I found a roast with a built in thermometer that pops when it's done.  I followed the recipe for slow cooking, knowing the button would "pop" when done.   Oh, do I feel like I was cheating!   I used my electric slicer to cut as thin as possible.  It was hard to keep from eating, in fact, I had several slices!  Having done that, I can tell you I am so looking forward to dinner!  The seasoning of garlic and pepper was PERFECT!  Thank you Brian for sharing your FANTASTIC recipe!!

I am very rarely successful in making roast beef. It always comes out too dry or too tough. I followed this recipe to a tee and am happy to say that it came out perfect. I can see where some may like it a bit more done in that case you would follow the directions for medium. I let it rest as long as it cooked before I sliced. Made the best beef sandwiches ever. Big hit! Thanks bd!

Followed the directions for medium.  Took out of oven  at 135 degrees, perfect!  2.5 hours from browning to oven removal (4 pound roast)

Perfect!! This method beats all others. I typically use a high-temperature method but after reading these reviews and knowing that the submitter knows what he's doing, I tried this with a 2-pound piece of beef. I adjusted the times accordingly. It was cooked exactly how we like it, tender and succulent. Thank you for this awesome recipe!!

Absolutely 100% fail-proof and FABULOUS!  I have made this twice and both times were perfect.  I do not have a meat slicer, but, even sliced a little thicker by cutting with a knife the beef is tender and melt in your mouth.  Thank you so much for the wonderful recipe!  You are a hero in my house!

This was quite tasty.  I will probably play with the seasonings a little, and lower the time a bit - one of the two roasts came out more done, despite the size being darn close to the other.  The one that came out medium was very very good.

I put 1 c water in the bottom of the roasting pan to work with the drippings and roasted some baby potatoes, halved, in the drippings for about 45 minutes while the roast was standing and cooling.  Used a spoon to rotate the potatoes once in the middle of the time, added gravy starter and some water, roasted some more, about 15 minutes.  Divine potatoes. :)  Family was quite pleased.

UPDATE: I just used the basics for a pork loin, cut in half so I could sear it effectively.  Cooked to 140 and removed to stand.  Pork roasts are something of a specialty of mine, and this is easily THE best and juiciest and most tender I've ever produced.  My sister doesn't like pork, and she described it as "heaven."  I had originally been cooking it to use in recipes in place of chicken, but it's just toooo good for that!  I did alter the seasoning, using a packet of garlic and herb recipe starter as a rub after rinsing and drying. Seared, then added some salt and pepper before roasting.  Was pressed for time so skipped the overnight marinate in the rub, and it is simply divine.

Really is a good, easy recipe. The key is not to over cook... I've had people think it was a tenderloin.... Good way to entertain and then have some sandwich goodie for later. Poor man's banquet !!!!!

This recipe rocks!!!
Couldn't be any more simple. Did it just like it was written, came out wonderful. Almost 4 pounds gone in 1 day between snacks right after it was cooked, and open face sammies for lunch the next day.
Thank you so much for sharing!

Turned out perfect and my picky husband loved it.  Was moist, not dry at all.  Made French dip sandwiches out of it.  Will definitely make this again

try cooking the roast the day before you eat it, much easier to slice thin the next day

Total WIN.  Thank you so much for this super-easy, perfect preparation method.  Our eye of round was only 2 lbs.  I roasted it at 275° F for 20 minutes per pound.  We like our beef very very pink (rare - med. rare.)
This was perfect.
