This is sooooo good! I LOVED it. The gravy becomes nice & brown & delicious. The only thing I changed was I added a couple of chipotle peppers (in adobo sauce) b/c I had them left over from a previous recipe. We like a little "spice." :-) Try it! You will not be disappointed! So easy too.

I added 1/4 cup of honey and 1/3 cup of brown sugar.  I also cut the molasses down to 1/4 cup.  I cooked for a total of 8 hours on low in my slow cooker.  This was very good and very tender.  I will definitely make this again.

Awesome, Awesome, Awesome.  this was a major hit at our house.  I did have to make a couple of substitutions do to lack of shopping desire.  I used soy sauce and honey/ brown sugar instead of worcestershire and molasses.  I also used a cheap roast that I had in the freezer.  So yummy, will totally make this again.

I did add honey and brown sugar because I thought it needed sweetness. When I make again, I will probably reduce or not even use the molasses. It was a very strong flavor.

We tried it for New Years Day 2011 and like some of the other reviewers added 1/3 cup brown sugar and an extra thinly sliced onion and it turned out wonderful.  Nice sweet brown broth with a sweet mildly spiced bbq flavor. A keeper recipe easy and good!

I was very pleased with this recipe. I did as other viewers, added honey and brown sugar together and no molasses. A dash of hot sauce and we had a winner. Definately make again.

I thought this recipe was very good and had a lot of flavor.  I did add abut 2 Tbsp. of brown surgar to the sauce near the end which I liked.  I think that any type of beef roast could be used.  Does not have to be a brisket.  In fact, I would say a rump roast would be great, as slow cooking makes them almost shred apart and mix more with the sauce.

This was great. I followed the receipe except used honey/soy instead of molasses. My husband loved the flavor and couldnt stop eating it. I would recommend cutting it up and placing it back into the sauce for the last 30 -1hr. That way the taste goes completely through the meat. I will make this again.

This is delicious. I used a medium heat jar of Pace and added some chili powder for some additional heat. I loved it so much I made it again for a family gethering and it was a huge hit.

Even though I too doctored it up a bit, the base Campbell's recipe is easy, quick, and gives the perfect foundation to personalize your meal! As advised, I cut the molasses down to 1/4c and added 1/4c brown sugar. I used 2 onions, and replaced the picante with a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with jalapenos. Added some delicious heat. The brisket was melt-in-your-mouth perfect after 8 hours in my slow cooker. Perfect busy-weekday main dish!

This recipe was soooo good!! I did like some of the other reviews and added a little bit of brown sugar. When it was done cooking, I took it out and shredded it then put it back in for 20-30 more minutes or so (with the crockpot turned off). It really picked up the flavor!! I also served mine in flour tortillas with a little bit of spicy ranch and slice of avocado!! So delicious!!!!

This is the best thing I have ever made in the crockpot. I used less molasses and some brown sugar as per other reviews. Amazing! My husband and kids loved it!
