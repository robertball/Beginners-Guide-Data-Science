great, simple to do, recipe that pleases a crowd!  I used crushed Cheese crackers instead of the corn flakes.  It was yummy!

This was ok - we didn't really care for the flavor of it.  You have to love Thyme to enjoy this recipe.  I think it really overpowers the dish.

This recipe is great. I changed it a little. I sauted fresh mushrooms in with the onion, garlic & celery mix. I also used cream of chicken with herbs. Instead of the frozen italian veggies, I used half a can of peas and half a can of sliced carrots. I mixed everything together in a large bowl and topped with italian bread crumbs. It reminded me of a pasta pot pie. Excellent comfort food. My 2 year old loved it as well.

Easy to make, but needs more seasonings.  Smelled delicious, but lacked in flavor.  Will make again with some changes.

This was great! I steamed a few chicken breasts and basically followed the recipe to a tee, except I used whole wheat egg noodles and breadcrumbs instead of corn flakes. Comfort food that really isn't unhealthy - thanks for tailoring the recipe and making it more healthful! Hubby and kids loved it too!

I only made this to use up some stuff hanging out in the pantry. I'm not terribly thrilled with the outcome. Only change I made was subbing crushed chez-its for the corn flakes. Bland, bland, bland.

Decent taste, kid-friendly, basic comfort food, but not a dazzler.

Pretty good. I spiced it up a bit to our families tasting. Lemon pepper and paprika were great.

I followed the recipe as written & it was much too bland for us.  Still able to eat it for dinner, but no one wanted seconds & I won't be making it again.  Perhaps we just like things with a bit more spice or garlic.  Good to try though.

It wasn't bad. I would give it three and a half stars if I could. It was a little bit bland for me. If I made it again I would try cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken soup because to me it has more flavor. Also, I needed about 20 more mins uncovered to heat through.. maybe my casserole dish was too deep.
