Fantastic!  Perfect for a cold autumn day!  I made a few adjustments to simplify and suit my taste:  Leave out the caraway seeds.  (personal taste)  Don't rinse the kraut.  Keep all that great flavor!  No need to spend time peeling the apples...the skins cook down and get nice and soft, blending in with the kraut.  I decreased the potatoes, cut them into small chunks, and put them on the bottom.  Also, I cooked the stew on LOW for about 7 hours and it was great.  (Stir halfway through to insure even cooking.)  We put swiss cheese on the first serving, but left it off after that.  This dish can stand on its own!  (and I put cheese on EVERYTHING!)  Delicious!!!

I thought that my husband had finally lost his mind after he mentioned that his Gram mixed kielbasa, sauerkraut, apples, and onion all together & that he actually liked it....so I looked for a recipe and here I am.  This ROCKS!  The only thing I did differently was to add babyback ribs to the concoction (it's how Gram did it).  My husband is a HAPPY man & the kids and I loved it as well!  Thanks Michele :)

Added an extra layer of flavor by 1st gently sauteing onion & sauerkraut in a fry pan w/ a little margarine/butter for about 6 min, till both were a bit carmelized (my mom always "prepared" sauerkraut this way, even for hot dogs). Then add sauerkraut/onion mixture to the crock pot w/the remaining ingredients.  Don't overcook, 1-2 hrs. are just fine for this dish, you don't need 4 hrs.

My husband and I absolutely loved this dish!!  We did not rinse the saurkraut because we really like the tartness and we added a little black pepper.  I think next time I may add a cup of dark beer like Guiness in place of one of the cups of stock--I think this would be really good.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Good concept poor execution on my part.  Loved the sausage could have added about 50% more.  Used 2 lbs unpeeled baby red potatoes and layered on bottom as suggested...this worked great.  Apple rings were a little hard to slice, would just cut chunks next time and probably add more apples too, wouldn't bother peeling next time.  The apple flavor got lost with all the kraut and onion.  I would add some apple cider to the broth next time or cut it maybe 50/50.  This is a delicate recipe and is easy to over cook, which I did, so the apples dissappeared into mush.  Would recommend adding the apples closer to the end next time to keep them crisp.  Forgot to put the cheese on top -- I thought something was missing!  I used Bavarian style kraut and it was certainly less pungent especially after rinsing... enough so that my picky kids ate a bowlful.  Will try this one again making a few alterations.  For me time listed is a definitely the maximum, this is more of a 1/2 day recipe than an all day recipe.  Doesn't get better with extra cooking time.  With more apple flavor and crisper veggies/fruit this could be 5 star.

I never would have thought of combining all these foods, but yum! I will do a few things differently next time, though: I'll put the potatoes closer to the bottom so they all get done at the same time. Also, I'll put the meat closer to the top so it doesn't get quite as done. And I may use a little less liquid. NOTE: For those who are worried about a too-strong sauerkraut taste, use Frank's Bavarian kraut. It's milder and a bit sweeter than regular kraut.

This is really good! The kraut flavor is not too strong - just right.  i also changed the order in which I layered the ingrediants in the slow cooker, putting the potatos on the bottom, 1/2 of the sausage next, then kraut, then the rest of the sausage, aplles, and then the onions.  I also only used half of the potato called for.  Great!!

This is a phenomenal recipe!  The previous reviews were very helpful - yes, Bavarian style sauerkraut has a nice mild flavor, and yes, you don't need to add all the potatoes.  I made half a recipe becuase I did not want the two of us to be eating it for a week but it was so good that we made it again only a few days later.  I did not even bother with the caraway seeds, the other ingredients are flavorful enough.  I did not serve it with cheese because I didn't have any and it was wonderful anyway.  We will definitely make this again and again.

We really loved this recipe.  I used Bavarian Sauerkraut as suggested by another review and I loved the milder flavor with this dish.  It allowed all the rest of the flavors to come through too.  I used a blend of apples, because of what I had on hand, and liked the sweet and tart flavors that that added. I did have to cook it a lot longer to have the potatoes cook through, even though I made sure they were on the bottom of the cooker.  Will definately make again and I have already shared this recipe with friends.  Thanks for the recipe!

Doesn't look very good when cooked all day, but was quite tasty.  I added a little bit of brown sugar to keep the sauerkraut from being so sour.

Deceivingly delicious! Be sure to use kielbasa that is not precooked. I went with Kisslemans kraut because it expressly says on the package not to rinse. To keep it simple and quick remember this: Sausage and potatoes; one inch pieces. Apples and onion; half inch slices. Do everything else as suggested and you'll love it!

Left out the potatoes and used turkey kielbasa to lighten it up. Perfect balance of sour, salty, sweet and astringent. This is a favorite now.

This turned out awesome!   Not everyone in my family is big on Swiss cheese, but it was the perfect cheese to make just the right blend of flavors in this dish!

I loved this recipe. I used fresh polish keilbasa, not the packaged junk you find at the supermarket. I also added about a cup of chunky applesauce to the mix, just to give the apple a more pronounced flavor. I also omitted the cheese and caraway seeds. There were no leftovers 24 hours later!

We really liked this.  I did however only use 1 apple (some have issues with sweet food here) used beer instead of chicken broth and omitted the swiss cheese.  My crock pot is a little off so I put this in a 9x13 pan and baked at 350 for about 1 1/2 hrs.  Served it with Beer Biscuits from this site.

I added some apple cider to the recipe because it didn't seem like there was enough liquid. I also didn't add the apples until the very end so they didn't disintigrate. Very tasty. The saurkraut, surprisingly, isn't overpowering at all.

Absolutely delicious...especially on a cold, cold night.  The only thing I changed was that I used fennel seeds instead of caraway seeds based on personal taste.  Otherwise, I followed it exactly and it was perfect!

It's better the second day when the flavors have a chance to blend more.  But it's not as good as just sauerkraut and kielbasa served up with rye bread.

This was wonderful, and other than peeling the potatoes, it was not difficult or time consuming.  My husband isn't much for sauerkraut, but he enjoyed the polish sausage and potatoes.  I loved it and there are plenty of left overs since there's just 2 of us.  The swiss cheese was a nice touch.  Will make again!

My maternal grandmother used to make this, but she did not add any caraway seeds or Swiss cheese. She also always rinsed the kraut thoroughly so it was very sweet tasting not heavy salty YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMY

My husband and I didn't care for this, but ironically my 9-year-old daughter loved it. I did use fresh ingredients -- fresh kielbasa from the butcher rather than prepackaged (which I browned in a skillet before adding to slow cooker) and fresh cabbage. But I don't think that affected the overall taste enough to warrant changing my rating. I love German food, but I found the taste of this dish off-putting.

I added 1/2 cup white wine, 1 bay leaf, and a little thyme.  Also, I boiled everything except the meat on the stove top until the liquid was nearly gone, then added the Kielbasa, covered with a lid, and baked in the oven.  I forgot to use the cheese, but it didn't matter.  It was delicious!

This recipe should be called "Must love Sauerkraut", :P My boyfriend loved it but I am not such a sauerkraut fan so I didn't enjoy it as much, when I made this recipe I cubed the potatoes into smaller bits so they cooked through all the way, I layered those on the bottom and then sauerkraut, sausage,sliced apples, and poured the liquid over the top. Next time I will cube the apples as well and add them halfway through cooking time, they did get a bit mushy. A bit hit for you sauerkraut lovers out there! Thanks for the recipe Michele, even though I learned I don't like sauerkraut that much my boyfriend is a very happy man, haha! :)

We really didn't like this.  I'm not sure if it was the sauerkraut (I usually like sauerkraut) but everything was sour.  The kielbasa was tasty, the long cook time made it tender and juicy, but we ended up throwing it all away because the smell wasn't to our liking.  I might try this again, using shredded cabbage with sugar and vinegar.

This is very good. It's now on my regular rotation of slow cooker recipes! I forgot to put on the swiss cheese at the end but it was still good.

I like sauerkraut but this was a bit too much for me.

However, everything else was very good, very tasty.

I substituted turkey sausage for the saugage the recipe calls for with good results.

I might make it again.

I loved this recipe although I would have to agree with one of the other reviewers that there were just a few too many potatoes.  Also, the potatoes need to go on the bottom or somewhere else besides the top.  Otherwise, this was great and I'm sure I'll make it again.

This was just fantastic! I am of Polish decent, and couldn't wait to try this. I'm so glad I did. I made a few substitutions though. I had no apples in the house, and decided to try unsweetened pineapple chunks instead. They really complimented the dish. I rinsed and drained the sauerkrout because my boyfriend hadn't eaten any since childhood. Instead of all chicken broth, I added the juice (about 2 tblspns)from the canned pineapple to offset the sauerkrout taste. I also added 2 oz. of mushrooms because I needed to use them up. Since I had no caraway seeds, I went with some fennel seeds. I put fresh ground black pepper over everything too. The end result had my boyfriend raving and saying he would eat sauerkrout, and this dish, anytime! Thank you Michele for a wonderful recipe!

We liked this for dinner, but didn't love it. Maybe it was because the recipe called for rinsing the sauerkraut before cooking--and we all like that potent sauerkraut taste!
Maybe next time I will skip the "rinse".

If you like Kielbesa then you'll love this recipe.  I made it because it sounded good, but unfortunately I am not a Kielbesa lover so I was a bit disappointed.  My husband liked it, my 5 year old and 8 year old didn't but my 13 month old son loved it.  He ate his whole dish! I'm glad I tried it!

Had this last night-very hearty flavor.  I didn't have red potatos, so used baking potatos and they worked very well.  Forgot to add the shredded swiss and it still tastes great.  I used 2 lbs of sauerkraut and 2 cups of fat-free chicken broth.

Am having the left-overs tonight with beer bread (and this time, I will remember to sprinkle it with swiss cheese!)  Yum!  Serve this on a cold night.

I made this for my family tonight, and myself my mom and dad liked it but the kids didnt. for a while i didnt think it was going to be juicy enough so after about 3 hours in the slow cooker i put in 2 cups of chicken broth and 1 of beef. another thing is i think that it would be a little better with only one pound of saurkraut but other wise it was really good and im definatly making it again.

I was looking for an easy slow cooker recipe and found this. The German half of me salivated at the ingredient list.. and it was even better after it was made! The stew was phenomenal the 2nd day, served with crusty rye bread.

This was just okay.  I've never eaten Kielbasa stew, so I don't know how this compares to others.  It sounded like a fun recipe to try.  It was pretty easy and we liked it well enough.  The sausage was very tasty and even my husband who hates sauerkraut thought it was okay.  However, I did alter the order in the crock pot by putting the potatoes on the bottom so they'd actually cook. Considering the meat was already cooked I didn't think they should go in the hottest part of the pot.  The only thing was, I discovered I absolutely positively HATE caraway seed.  It left an unpleasant aftertaste that almost ruined it for me entirely.  Next time I make this I'll leave that out.

I was intrigued by the mix of ingredients. I mean, really...apples with sauerkraut? Yet, it appealed to me. It was so easy to put together. I can honestly say, it was a treat to me.  The apple just took the bite out of the sauerkraut and onions. The mixture was very pleasing.  I will definitely make it again. It does take a little nerve for some people to try it if they know what's in it...I wouldn't tell them til they taste it.  It's a keeper.

I coudln't get the kids to touch this one with a 10 foot pole.  I liked it, but the flavors were a little too strong for me.  It was well worth trying once though, but have to admit that i probably won't try it again.

Even though this is a slow cooker recipe, the preparation time is brief so I gave it an excellent rating for quickness.  My husband is Polish and we enjoy this version of his family favorite, kielbasa and sauerkraut.

My husband and I really loved this stew! A lot of reviewers were so concerned about potatoes not cooking they put the potatoes on the bottom. We layered the ingredients as described in the recipe with the potatoes on top and the potatoes cooked perfectly. We'll be doing this recipe again. It was fantastic!

I thought I'd make this while I was at work.  4 hours on high means it should be ok for 8 hours on low, right?  Wrong!  Everything got a little "dark", including the potatoes.  I read in another post the potatoes also turned brown when cooked at the recommended time and temp.  It still tasted ok, but it didn't look anything like the picture.  I may try this one more time but mix the layer up so the potatoes are closer or in the water as well as cook it at the recommended time and temp.

Good flavor.  Wasn't a fan of the texture of the kielbasa after it was cooked though - a little mushy.  Think I may cook it for a little less time next try.

Served this to friends and they really enjoyed.  Definitely missing a little kick, though.  Recommend serving with Polish mustard.

This came out awful! When I tried to place everything in the crock pot, the quantity was too much.  I had to remove some of the potatoes (which I reduced to 1/2 lb to begin with) and some of the sausage to close the lid.  Once it cooked on low all day, it was a sloppy mess!  You couldn't tell whether you were eating sauerkraut, potatoes, or apples.  We wound up pitching whatever was left.  Sorry!

Good recipe and flavor, I just found the apple reparation a little time consuming. Also next time I'll probably 1/2 the recipe as this yeilded far too much for 2 people and didn't reheat well.

Great recipe! I halved the recipe and made it for New Years Day. My only suggestion is not to use "spicy" meat. We made this using Hilshire Farms jalepeno smoked sausage which made the entire dish really spicy which was a bit hard on the mouth after a while. But the tastes worked very well together, despite the strange combination of ingredients. My husband gobbled it up and I plan on making some to take to my parents in a few weeks.

Followed the recipe, I've used both Hillshire Farm and Echrich for the sausages, I think the Echrich is much better, it has a  better texture after the cooking.

My husband cooked this meal on a weekday night for me, his dad and best friend. We all enjoyed its' deliciousness. It was flavorful and very tasty. Kielbasa was nice and soft--so yummy!  We are planning on making it again this week!

My Dutch/Hungarian son-in-love loves me even more after I made this for him. The only thing I did different was use homemade sauerkraut. If you are a kraut lover this is to die for! Very easy to put together and a scents the kitchen  for hearty appetites. Thanks for a wonderfully easy delicious recipe!

This is so easy to throw together and so filling.  Not everyone liked the apples so I would call them optional.  I thought they were nice but would be fine without.   Really good quick weeknight meal.

Yeah! This is the stuff! Would have replied sooner, but I had to have another helping. Satisfying, especially if you're German, or part, or maybe anything. I made this just like the recipe says. And I will again.

Excellent.  
 I layered this recipe in the slow cooker with potatoes on the bottom, 1/2 sausage, drained  sauerkraut  (sprinkled brown sugar on top to sweeten), balance of sausage, onion and apple. Next time use only 1 cup chicken broth. Cooked in high for 3 hours-until potatoes were tender.  I omitted the caraway seed

I made this as the recipe called for and it was only ok. This isn't a keeper for us. The amount/cost of ingredients and the extended time needed to cook the potatoes all the way wasn't worth it.

My grandmother is German and my SO spent a few years living in Germany, and this dish got their seal of approval. I wasn't thrilled with how mushy the apples got, next time I will add them later in the process. I would also add a little beer to the chicken broth for a bit of an extra kick. I didn't drain off too much of the sauerkraut juice either because I like the kick. Definitely serve with rye bread, kaiser rolls are too bland.

This came out really great!  I had to change the servings (cooking for 1 with a few leftovers, and the original would have had me eating this for several weeks!) and used just a can of kraut.  Probably a bit too much, but it gave GREAT flavor.  I'm sure I'll be making this again!

I cut kielbasa slices in half and put all on the bottom. I didn't have an apple, so I substituted apple cider for the chicken broth. I used 3/4 bag of cabbage and carrot bagged coleslaw (without the dressing) instead of sauerkraut topped with half onion diced.  Added cracked pepper on top of bite size potato pieces.  Skipped the caraway seeds. 4 hours on low. Next time I'll add some garlic I think for more flavor.

I made this without the saurkraut. Though I added a few tablespoons of apple cider vinegar to substitute the vinegar-ness. Also added some asparagus. It was good, not overly flavorful though.

I tried this despite the reviews...I really wanted to like it but didn't. I used mild Bavarian sauerkraut, put the potatoes on the bottom, omitted the caraway seeds (didn't have any)& Swiss (didn't have any), used beef broth (what I had on hand) & halved the recipe. I'm Polish & usually I love anything with kielbasa in it. My husband ate it but didn't really like it either. Sorry.

This was a perfect meal for the beginning of fall.  It took a lot longer to cook for the potatoes to soften so allow extra time.  I didn't use the carroway seeds and it was fine. It definately reminds you of a good home cooked meal to be shared with family and friends.

I'm not a big fan of sauerkraut so I only used half of what it called for and it turned out really good. I don't know if I would like it with even more in it. I made it because my husband really likes sauerkraut and he too said that was just the right amount.

Great 'Comfort Food'  I used Polish Sausage and a big tin of sauerkraut layered twice.  Suggest using more apple and caraway than recipe calls for and the next time I'm going to try and use some of the sauerkraut juice as part of the liquid as we like the sourness of the kraut.  Thanks for sharing.

My husband really enjoyed this-- except the apples.  He couldn't get past the thought of them being with the kraut.  I liked it too.  I rinsed the kraut because we don't eat it too often and I wasn't sure how sour we would like it.  But we could definitely do more sour so next time I wont rinse.  The only other change I would make is less apples since I'm the only one eating them (see above ;).  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was OK.  I was excited to try the combination of flavors (i.e. sausage, kraut, potatoes, apples and onion - all favorites of mine).  I was disappointed with the results, however.  I made this for my parents, and they seemed to like it.  No one raved over it though.  This was very easy to make (just dump all of the ingredients in a slow-cooker and forget about it!).  Be sure to keep an eye on the potatoes....  Some of mine turned brown (not all of them, but the ones on top did).  I make a similar recipe without the potatoes, broth and onions (mine is made with sausage, apples, kraut, caraway seeds, apple juice and brown sugar) and like it much better.  Thanks anyways.

I chose not to rinse the kraut, and I liked the apples. I'd nix the potatoes, as they didn't cook in the crock-pot anyways, even after all night and half of Thanksgiving day. Nice change of pace, but I can honestly say once a year is enough.

I thought this recipe was really good, and I'm not a huge sauerkraut fan.  I used regular potatoes and put them on the bottom as someone earlier suggested and everything meshed together really well.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I took this to a church soup dinner and everyone seemed to like it - but it got no "RAVES".  I thought it was very good very flavorful.  I'll make again!

This stew went like wild fire one very cold day, just before Christmas while vacationing at a ski resort. 14 Adults and 6 Children polished it off in less than an hour, and left me with nothing but the crock pot to bring home (and of course a mental note to make this a regular).  Great recipe!

I made it as a casserole since I haven't got a slow cooker & topped it with Monterray Jack cheese & it was great & easy!  Not the boring old kielbassa & kraut my husband asks for - this time we both enjoyed it.
