Not so good. Followed exactly and it came out very wet. I had to bake it twice as long to make it work. Good flavor, but otherwise not impressed.

This was a very easy recipe! The flavor was good but very runny like the others said. Next time I make it I'll omit the corn syrup & add 1/4c. of corn starch to the peaches.

This was pretty good.  However, it is really runny which is fine if you like extra sauce for ice cream.  Really really sweet, next time I will cut the syrup and sugar in half.
