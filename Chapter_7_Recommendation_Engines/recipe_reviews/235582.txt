This dish was great! I modified it by using fresh diced potatoes. (I microwaved the potatoes for 3 minutes first) I browned the chicken and potatoes and seasoned them with garlic salt, pepper and mrs dash. I then sautéed fresh red peppers, onions and garlic and topped the chicken and potatoes with it. For the soup mixture I added cheddar cheese soup instead of a cup of cheese and plenty of seasoning. I poured it over the top and baked. Then I topped the dish with 1/2 cup cheddar cheese and 1/2 cup pepper jack and the crumbled bacon and browned 10 more minutes ! It turned out to be delicious! Even my 6yr old (who hates potatoes) loved it.

Due to a picky husband, I replaced the diced potatoes with onions and peppers (and green onion) with sliced potatoes only.Instead of shredded chicken I left it in chunks for quicker prep time. I also tossed in a can of cream of cheddar soup. Followed the rest as is and it turned out delicious!

Wish I could give it a higher rating. The first time I made this, the family dog who is blind went nuts over this.  He couldn't stop sniffing & trying to find it. Even when the left overs where heated up, he again would try to find it. So it is a HIT with the humans & the animals in the house!!  Dog has never acted this way before with anything I've made.  And he likes a lot of what I make.

Omg! This was so good! Well I rarely make dishes like this but I had all the ingredients for the most part. I boiled the chicken and put about 10 or so hash browns in a pot with a bit of water to soften them up. While that stuff was cooking, I cooked the bacon and set it aside. Then sautéed red onion in the bacon drippings.

I made this yummy casserole JUST AS THE RECIPE STATED! It was fantastic...like eating a loaded baked potato with chicken. I will definitely make this again and will save it for a casserole to take to a friend in need!

Really good casserole, however it is really just hash-brown casserole with added chicken and bacon.  I used hash-browns with onions and peppers.  I also cooked my chicken in oil with salt, pepper and two cloves crushed garlic before shredding.  I am not a fan of cream of chicken so I used cream of celery, as I usually do and a mixture of cheddar and velveeta for the cheese.  Sometimes I make this with cubed ham and broccoli instead of chicken and bacon.  Both variations are really good and my 4 kids devour it.  Anything all your children will eat is a plus in my book!!

I used fresh vegetables  instead of frozen. Took longer to bake but very good. I also  used more bacon. I would redo this dish.

I tried this recipe for the first time, and I like it. I think the soup/sour cream mixture needs some more flavor. 
Maybe another herb or spice, other than pepper and garlic powder.

Not bad, but not my favorite. I would make it again though! I used tator tots instead of the potatoes listed. I baked the tator tots(seasoned with salt & pepper) and some freshly chopped onions for ten min in the oven before adding the other ingredients like in the recipe.  I used more bacon than called for (more bacon is always better!). I also added the bacon on top of the cheese before putting it back in the oven so it would melt into the cheese. Overall, no complaints from my family and there were no leftovers! Would try next time what someone else suggested with pepper jack cheese on top! Yum!

Very tasty! I was looking for a new way to use shredded chicken, and this recipe turned out well. I did not have any frozen hash browns on hand, but I DID have red potatoes, so I used my cheese grater to scallop / shred about 6 medium-sized potatoes, microwaved them for a few minutes as another reviewer suggested, and used them in this casserole. Since I had plenty of green onions on hand, I put about 3/4 c. on the potato layer with extra bacon, seasoned salt, pepper, and garlic powder before I put the chicken layer on and cooked it. 
Thank you for a good recipe!!

this was so good. I will add this to my new recipes to make often. I did make a couple changes just added a bag of broccoli, 2 more cups of cheese and 1 lb of bacon to the original recipe. Wanted it to be more nutritious with the veggies it was great

Delicious! Fed my picky family of 4 with just enough left over for 2 of us to take some for lunch tomorrow. However, 375 was not enough to cook everything evenly and hot enough, even when it stayed in for an extra 15 minutes (before the 5 minutes uncovered with cheese). I forgot to buy bacon (whoops!) so that wasn't included and I also got the frozen hashbrowns without veggies (see above, picky family.) Overall it was a great comfort food recipe. Will definitely be making again!

I used shredded potatoes. I also added green peppers and mushrooms. 3 adults and 3 kids had this and we barely had any leftovers.

I used regular diced frozen potatoes but browned them in a little bacon grease first. Added fresh sautéed onion and baked as directed. Once I added the bacon I also added a handful of cashews. Awesome.

Very good!! I didn't use green onions because I didn't have any and used pre-cooked bacon but other than that followed the recipe as listed!  Thanks for posting, this will go in the rotation!!

Really delicious! I mixed the diced potatoes with the cream soup and sour cream, then layered sliced cooked chicken on top. Last 15 minutes I put cheese and bacon on top. Just like a loaded baked potato with chicken.

I agree with others a little bland. Next time I'll add fresh peppers and onions to kick up the flavor a little bit.
