Adorable! I also made "octapus" hotdogs by making several slits starting about a quarter of the way down the dog. Once in the boiling water the "legs" will curl up slightly. Nestle on top of a bowl of mac and cheese for a cute presentation. Thanks!

Very cute recipe!  I also make an octopus out of hot dogs and sit it on "blue"(just a drop of food coloring) mac and cheese.  The kids LOVE this stuff!

I am rating this a 5 for the sheer adorable-factor!  A hot dog is a hot dog, but this makes it fun to eat.  I am going to make these today for my 2 boys, and I know they will go nuts, as they were fans of the octopus as well. Another thing we do in our house is slice them, add a little ketchup and mustard on top of each one (like a sushi roll), and serve with chop sticks!  Also a big hit!

I gave my two year olds the giggles with these and once my daughter got over the fact that no, dressing your hot dog up in doll clothes is not allowed, she and her brother had a great time eating them for lunch today.

This gets 5 stars because they are just TOO FUN.  Why had I never heard of this before?  I, personally, did not eat the little hot dog man, but my son really got a kick out of it.  This was fun to make together, too.  Cool idea!!!!!!

its a hotdog...use all beef, its as good as a hotdog gets...but the little ones think you are a cooking genius...they love to play with & "EAT" their dinner. If you have a picky eater, try this one.

So so so easy and it thrilled my kids. I had a bunch of leftover weenies with no buns, so needed something that wouldn't require the buns. This was a perfect way to use up the extra weenies - I threw them on top of a batch of mac and cheese. Kids got a kick out of it!

We are super busy with ball practices, and eat quick foods like hot dogs often.  I was glad to find a variation that seemed different than a 'regular' hot dog. They like them when I slice it like an octopus. My oldest, who claims to dislike hot dogs, asks for seconds this way and asks for them when friends come over. (And she's in middle school!)

Very funny to serve to the kids, although they were very unsure about biting off his head.  I put shredded cheese by his head for hair, and served it with cheesy spaghetti.

Giving these a 5 because they are so simple and fun. I don't even have kids but had a blast with them. For the head, I cut off the top of another hot dog and attached it with a toothpick.

I remember my mom making these for me when I was growing up.  I've made these (and octopus hot dogs) for all three of my children.  Kids love them!  This is a great idea for picky eaters.

Cute idea.  I did this for my grandson. While camping last summer we cut 2 slits 1/4 of the way down on each end of the hot dogs so we had 4 legs at each end.  We cooked them using our campfire sticks over the fire and when they were cooked the legs curled up and the hot dogs became spiders.  The kids loved them.

My boys love this was well, but we do the octpus with seaweed!  We use roman noodles with green food color!  Also instead of using the pack that comes in the noodles we drain the noodles and add butter and parmesan/romano cheese!

My kids loved this! I got creative and dyed the mac-n-cheese green, saying it was "grass".  Then, I chopped up bananas and cheese, saying it was his "toys". My kids laughed as they cleaned their plate.  What a fun recipe! Thanks!!!!

I have grandchildren and this was a great and very entertaining meal for them.  Anything that makes dinner fun is good for the kids and, therefore, good for me!

If you do choose to make this recipe, my kids enjoyed using Kraft American cheese instead of the other brands.

My 4 year old Daughter loves these hot dog men.  She likes her on a bed of macaroni and cheese. I just make a pack of the microvable kind. She doesn't like ketchup so it's all mustard for the eyes, mouth and buttons. Thanks for making lunchtime fun!
