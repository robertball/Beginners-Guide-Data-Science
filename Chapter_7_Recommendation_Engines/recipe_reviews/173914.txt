I gave this recipe a 3 due to the obvious inaccuracy of the measurement of beef broth.  Be prepared when you are getting your shopping list ready that you will need AT LEAST 5 cans of beef broth in order to have enough liquid.  I used the original recommendation of two and had to go buy three more cans in order for the liquid to even cover the ingredients.  I also left out the rutabaga due to personal taste.  
ADDITIONAL NOTE:  I read the following review which gave this recipe 5 stars- please note I had to add the additional beef broth AFTER I had cooked the stew for about four hours.  It did NOT make beef soup, I ended up with a perfectly thick beef stew after amending the original recipe.

I never do this, but I am writing in response to the first review for this recipe.  I have made beef stew in the slow cooker for a long time, and 5 cans of beef broth is WAY TOO MUCH!!!!  Unless, you want beef soup, not stew.  Two cans is the correct measurement with 1 lb of beef, especially with water added. The meat and veggies add liquid to the stew while it cooks.  I usually use two cans of broth and then added a can of diced tomatoes because I like tomoatoes in my beef stew! Don't forget the Worcestshire sauce!

Best stew I've ever had, though I did alter it a bit.  I used fresh potatoes & onions instead of the packaged kind and twice as much beef.  I also used 32oz beef broth to account for the extra beef and because I omitted the rutabaga (didn't have any) and celery (allergic). Cooked it on the low setting for 10 hours.  So delicious!  We normally like to add ketchup to our servings, but this stew was so flavorful it didn't need it!

We really enjoyed this recipe!  I left out any veggies that I didn't like (rutabaga) - doubled it and took it to a pot luck; GONE! Everyone was scraping the bottom.
