This was a pretty good marinade.  I got mine marinated for about 4 hours and suggest just going with the overnight, I really think the flavors would sink in better.  Served mine sliced up and on a salad :)

This recipe was really good.  Only changes I made were out of neccesity.  I didn't have fresh cilantro so I used Knorr Cilantro boullion cubes.  I didn't have fresh garlic but some already chopped garlic in a jar.  oh and I used vegetable oil instead of Olive oil.  I only marinaded it for about an hour but the flavor was so good and the chicken was really tender.  I did add a bit of salt to the marinade, but you dont have to.....

Good flavor, the whole family enjoyed it on some grilled boneless skinless chicken thighs. We marinated it for about 7-8 hours. It was a great recipe using things we generally already have on hand.

This recipe is wildly delicious! I love Cilantro so used a lot. The only change I'd make is to use my favorite pepper, which is Smoked. The unique flavors blend perfectly & it flavors the meat intensely. Love this one

I omitted the cilantro because I don't care for it. I put everything else in a quart-sized ziplock bag and shook it up to marinate it. I then left the bag in the fridge over night. The next day I emptied 1/2 of the marinade into a bowl, added half of a chopped onion and baked the remaining marinade and chicken on 350 for about 20 minutes. Absolutely delicious!! Next time I'll put this over white rice. Yum!
