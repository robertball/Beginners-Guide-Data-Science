Love love LOOOOOOOVE this recipe. I have done this and tons of different twists on this. And, just a TIP to Moms on a Budget  and/or looking for a quick easy meal and EVEN BETER, can also be made to use up left overs , not just as the full meal you make, which cuts the cooking time and cost  less cuz you're reusing! So I've used this technique but replace the bbq beef with sloppy joes "unsloppy joes",  or pulled pork,  also I've put just the basic ingredients for a generic chicken pot pie, but they're little mini pies. I just used frozen mixed veggies, depending on how much you're making, one or two cans of cream of chicken or mushroom soup. I always make it with one of each, and then you can take extra time and cube a lb or 2 of boneless chicken breasts use you're favorite seasonings if you choose, I always use seasoning salt and garlic and cook up chicken in a pan  til brown. This way is gonna give you good flavor and it's perfect if you like bigger  bites of chicken in your pie. I started this recipe already one night before realizing I was out of chicken.  I used a nice canned chicken I'd bought from SAMs club a while before and it turned out good. The shredded chicken quality was more like real pot pie. I've used rotisserie chicken now that's delish!! You could do tons! I could go on and on. Give it a shot. Make this recipe (and some ice made if you want) and try some of your own with your leftovers or whatever!!! Happy Cooking!

Decent.  I first made these many years ago in school, in cooking class.  Works good too if you use leftover roast instead of hamburger.  However, my one complaint is that Grands Original style biscuits are a little too sweet for this.  Maybe I'll try a different variety next time.

Love it!! Use a good BBQ sauce. A spicy BBQ sauce goes really well with this.

Ok, this is ridiculous.  Super easy.  Super delicious.  I had leftover cooked pork tenderloin in the fridge so I chopped it up and added the bbq sauce instead of cooking up ground beef.  Everything else was done as directed.  I can't wait to make them again! Will try it with beef and chicken eventually too, but FYI the pork was perfect!

Just made them for dinner tonight! Soo good. I was going to change the recipe and make them in a bigger muffin plan thinking they looked pretty small. But I stuck to what the recipe said and I'm glad I did!

This is good, however I used vegan meat and I added seasons in the dough.
