I got this recipe in the 70's when Carl Reiner made them on the Dinah Shore Show. They have become a Christmas favorite with my family and friends. They aren't pretty but the taste is fabulous. They taste better after they are cooled. When I take them as Christmas gifts to the office they are ALWAYS the favorite cookie...I have to give them away or I would eat them all!!

Love these cookies! I've made them off and on for the last 27 years. I use one halved walnut per dropped cookie instead of chopping the nuts and adding to the batter. I couldn't believe how good these were the first time I made them after writing down the ingredients Carl gave inbetween comedy acts on a show he hosted. I ALWAYS double this recipe 'cus they are just soooo good.

I used margarine instead of butter because the written instructions stated "oleo." Oleo is the vintage term used back in the 60s and 70s for margarine. It gives it a cake like texture that is both dense soft and what some might consider greasy. These are the cookies I grew up with and I loved everything about them. Thanks for the memories!

Excellent. These cookies are so so easy to make and taste wonderful. I'll be making these often from now on. The great thing is that they are not picky. If you overcook them a little it's no big deal. No special techniques are necessary just mix the ingredients together and put them in the oven. The one thing I don't like about them is that they are so rich I can only stand to eat one or two before I'm full. Actually though healthwise that's probably a good thing.

I had 4oz of cream cheese left over from a recipe and went looking for a cookie recipe and came across this one. These are so good they melt in your mouth and didn't last long at all. So easy to make without a lot of fuss.

Simple recipe! Which was exactly what I needed. I added 3-4 tablespoons chips because I'm a chocoholic. Also a splash of vanilla extract because its always delicious and I read that the taste of these was a bit bland. I also had to cook them longer but I'm 90% sure that's because of my old oven. Turned out great though!

These were delicious but too soft. I made 12 cookies with this recipe each 2 to 3 inches in diameter. I baked all 12 on a single half-sheet pan for 13 minutes (longer than the recommended 10 minutes) at which point they still looked too pale on top but I feared I might be drying them out so I took them out of the oven. Their undersides did brown somewhat (even on a bright aluminum pan) and did stick to the pan a little. Next time I would bake them longer (they hadn't dried out) and on a greased pan or on parchment or greased foil. And I'd wait for some browning. The softness may be due (only partly) to my adding 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract to the dough. But maybe there's also too much cream cheese in the recipe or not enough flour or maybe an egg is needed. (Or something!) In any case as is they should be served chilled (so the butter and cream cheese can stiffen again). The vanilla did make mixing the rather dense batter easier smelled great when baking and tasted great. BTW 9 tablespoons of sugar equals cup plus 1 tablespoon. (2 measurements are quicker than 9!)
