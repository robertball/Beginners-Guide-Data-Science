This was certainly different. I had some canned green beans that I needed to rotate out of my earthquake supplies and I also happened to have a can of tomato paste so I decided to give this one a try. Not my cup of tea. I like cumin but it didn't seem right in this dish. Thanks for the recipe. I'm sure someone else will like it. We're all unique.:-)

A little on the bland side using canned green beans. A sprinkle of crushed red pepper flakes helps this out. Next time I'll use fresh string beans.

My husband and I gave this a try. Not bad. Different! Will make again.
