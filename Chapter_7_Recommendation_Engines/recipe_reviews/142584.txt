I have been making a delicious twist of this recipe...1 pkg bacon, 1 can pineapple chunks. 1 c. brown sugar.  Wrap and secure with toothpicks as before, but place close together on broiling pan to allow grease to drain off.  Sprinkle brown sugar over the wraps and bake 30-40min at 350.  Enjoy!

Very popular and highly addictive. Depending on crowd I add 1/2 C of hot sauce to mixture. Also, have found is best to wrap so the fatty end of bacon is on the outside to best render/crisp up.

Husband *LOVED* them! I baked some per the recipe, and grilled some.  Both ways were wonderful.  I do not think that the sweet and sour sauce made much of a diference.

The flavor was wonderful - 5 stars.  I used fresh pineapple chunks and marinated them in Sweet Chili Sauce.  The method - well - let's just say could use some improvement.  I used an oiled rack over a baking sheet and I am glad I did - what a sticky drippy mess.  Next time - I will consider grilling these or even using pre-cooked bacon.  Another idea would be to cook them stove top - crisping up the bacon.  I did these to serve with Thai Fried rice - yum! Thanks for a tasty dinner.

Very good.  I messed this one up...but it was good.  I misread the recipe...did it from memory.  I wrapped the pineapple with bacon, put the toothpicks through them and then soaked in sweet and sour.  Baked and sprinkled with garlic powder.  They were very good.

Get ready to do an oven cleaning from the bacon grease in the oven afterwards, BUT - the end result is a delicious appetizer! I made these a while back for a friend's party, and they were a huge hit! I brought home the empty plate.

I make these with just brown sugar instead of the sweet n sour sauce.  I think it works best when I cut each slice of bacon in half.  I baked at 375 for 20 minutes, then turned and baked for another 10 minutes.

I don't eat meat, but family didn't like them either.  The sweet and sour sauce drained to the bottom of each one where it burned before the bacon was done.

I made this recipe for one of my son's parties and our whole family had great things to say about it. I used fresh pineapple for this recipe which worked out really well. I would say also be careful what packages of bacon you buy. One of mine was quite stringy which made wrapping the pineapple difficult and not so pretty. Also, be careful as wrapping the pineapple is time consuming!! Only change I made was I sprinkled with a very small amount of brown sugar just prior to baking.
