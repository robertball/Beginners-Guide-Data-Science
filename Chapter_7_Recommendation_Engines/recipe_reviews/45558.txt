After reading the reviews I was a little aprehensive to try this. 
I tweaked the recipe a bit and it was a success!
We are a garlic loving family so I put in garlic powder in with flour, ginger,etc. and fried up garlic cloves with the onions.  I didn't have Brandy so I added a splash of red wine vinegar.  The aroma was intense.  
I didn't use a lot of OJ and added a hint of ginger to the juices.
My family loved this although I myself didn't feel my tasebuds pop.  I did like it and will make it again because the kids enjoyed it as well as hubby.  Next time however I will tweak it some more. 
All in all, not a bad recipe!  Thanks!

I thought the breading on the pork chops became soggy in the sauce.  I didn't have any brandy so I substitued balsamic vinegar and the sauce was great.  I added a little corn starch to thicken it up, otherwise, I think it would have been watery.  I made it with some egg noodles on the side and spooned some of the sauce over those and they turned out better than the pork chops.  I'd make it again, but I think I'll skip the breading of the chops next time.

very good!! I made a few changes... instead of olive oil, i used virgin coconut oil (it added a light nutty flavor) and some rubbed sage to the pan while cooking the onions.
As some of the reviews stated that the orange juice was too watery, i used concentrated orange juice but did not add as much water as recommended... It turned out great!! very tender and quite a bit of flavor

This recipe was all right.  It is not a favorite, but something I would make every now and then just for something different.  I have made it twice -- once following the directions as is and the second making some tweaks.  The first time the orange taste was just too strong, and there was just something that didn't work for my family -- although I am not really sure what it was.  We didn't really dislike it, but we didn't love it either.  We liked the second go-around much better.  I dropped the flour, onions, olive oil, and brandy altogether and mixed together the following: 1/2 cup orange juice, ginger, salt, pepper, 1-teaspoon sage, half a packet of Lipton Golden Onion Soup Mix, splash of red wine, and added a tablespoon of brown sugar.  I then let my chops marinate in this mixture for an hour before covering them and baking them at 350 for about 45 minutes.

I cooked this tonight for my family;they did not like it. The flavor was bland and the chops were swimming in liquid...I don't know if it was because they were thick that the flavors didn't permeate or what. Also they were a bit tough. Maybe the meat, not the recipe. It had a great odor while baking though!

This recipe was an average recipe. My family and I thought the taste was okay but there was nothing extraordinary about it. I fixed it exactly as the recipe said.

This was not particularly impressive.  We did change the recipe very slightly by using fresh Japanese ginger in the orange juice, and used raspberry extract instead of the brandy.  350 for 45 minutes was no where near hot enough.  We ended up baking at 350 for 60 minutes, then 450 for 20 minutes to obtain a 140F internal temp.  As these were quite bland we ended up adding a good portion of fresh ground Hawaiian lava salt, and then finally doused them in smoked worcestershire sauce, which finally made them edible.  If I were to try this recipe again, I would mix the orange juice with the worcestershire sauce before baking, and then add a diced habanero tossed in just to make it memorable.   This recipe most certainly does need tweaking.

Well, I thought this was a great recipe.  I did do a few things differently, but not enough to change it completely.   I seasoned the chops with salt and pepper, ginger, garlic and paprika, and dusted with flour.  Sauteed them in a large frypan and then removed them.  I sauteed the onions with garlic,  added the brandy (which is important in this recipe, though bourbon could be substituted as another rater mentioned), and a few tablespoons of OJ concentrate and enough wter to make a nice sauce.  I then added the chops back to the pan, turned them several times to coat them, covered the pan and simmered them until cooked.  They were tender and very flavorful, and I used only one pan!!

They were already in the oven when I read the reviews about being soggy.  Turned up the heat, took off the cover and they came out great!

I made this for 2 and it came out perfect. I poured the orange juice around the chops not over them and they did not get mushy. Hubby liked them and especially the onions on top. Served with Garlic potatoes, and used the juice as gravy. Green Beans and a salad. thank you for the receipe

I loved this dish. My boyfriend said it was "OK", but anything not fried is just "OK" to him! Very light, and easy dish. I had some leeks so I used them instead of onion and didnt have any brandy so I used Grand Mariner (is that brandy, I dont know)...I loved it!!

Excellent recipe! Three changes, didn't use the flour, used sage instead of ginger, and deglazed the pan with Grand Marnier instead of the brandy. Definitely a keeper.

This was not to my liking. The breading came out soggy and it had a OVERWHELMING orange flavor that completly masked the ginger in the pork chops. Will definitly NOT make again.

This recipe was excellent.  My whole family (including the picky eaters) loved it.  I had to stray from the recipe a little.  I thought I had more orange juice then I did, so I cut an actual orange and squeezed the juice on, and added some of the fruit over the pork before baking.  The recipe was great though, I will definatly make it again.

This was a nice recipe to change up the pork chops.  The family liked them!  I did modify slightly.  I increased the fresh ground ginger to about 4 t. or 1 T. of fresh ground ginger (divided into 1/2).  I put half of the ginger into the onions just at the end of cooking them along with wine to de-glaze the pan (being sure to cook out the alcohol). I added 2 T. Soy Sauce and 1 T. Corn Starch to the orange juice and whisked until smooth then added to the pan of pork chops/onion mixture.  All in all, not bad.  I served with a rice dish that has 5 different types of rice and fresh green beans.

This is a good recipe and something a little different for pork chops.  The flavors were a nice combination.  I didn't have brandy, so I used triple sec.  Also, after baking the pork chops I thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch.  Will make these again and will try the recipe with the brandy.

This was a tasty flavor profile.  I did make some of the suggested changes to the recipe and the chops turned out moist and flavorful.  I used boneless chops so I only cooked it for 30 mins and that was plenty.  I added garlic powder & paprika to flour mixture.  I cooked the onions in the pan and added only 1 cup of OJ to the onions as they cooked to deglaze pan and about 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar and about 1 tbsp cornstarch to thicken sauce.  Served this up with some mashed potatoes and veggie and everyone loved it!

I thought this had a ton of flavor.  I made this recipe in half.  I marinated my chops for a couple of hours in a splash of brandy, a squeeze of fresh OJ, some ginger and some of the sliced onions.  I dried them off and dredged them as the recipe calls for.  The rest I followed pretty much as the recipe states, only without measuring too precisely.  My chops turned out very tender and flavorful.  I served them with a side of baked rice pilaf.  The sauce from the chops was fabulous with the rice.

This recipe was pretty good actually.  Rather than bread the pork chops, I just cooked the onion, then added sherry (since I had no brandy), then the orange juice and I cooked pork chops that were seasoned with all the recipe called for right in the juices. Very good flavor.  My husband like it alot!

The whole family liked them! I did tweak it to meet my family's diet needs and the ingredients I had on hand. Here's what I did: left out the flour but combined the ginger, pepper, and 1/4 tsp garlic salt I also subbed red wine vinegar for brandy. Sprinkled dry seasonings over both sides of chops and browned on both sides in 2 tbsp EVOO. Put chops in baking dish after browning and combined vinegar and 3/4 cup orange juice in the chops pan to capture the flavor of chops and seasonings. Poured juice over chops and baked covered for 30 min (my chops weren't that thick). Turned out great, even my picky 2 year old ate it!

This recipe is on the verge of being pretty good.  It needs something, but I don't know what.
Here's what I did to it.  I didn't have any brandy, so I used Cointreau orange liqueur.  I used 1/4 cup instead of a TBSP.  I also added 1 tsp orange peel to the flour mixture.  I cut the orange juice to 1 cup and at the end, mixed it with a little cornstarch to make a sauce.  I served it with rice.  Overall, pretty bland and tasteless.  I didn't really taste much orange, or ginger for that matter.  Like I said, this recipe is on the verge of being good.

I love this recipe!  I sometimes add soy sauce or teryaki.  One time I added a ginger teryaki marinade I had on hand.
It's a great recipe, we make it a lot

This was a very easy, nutritious meal to make and it was absolutely delicious. I served the pork chops with brown rice and steamed asparagus. I'm serving it at my next dinner party!

I tried this recipe, but I tweaked it a little. It turned out to be the best pork chops we had had in a while. I read all the reviews and took some suggestions from there. One thing I kept reading was that the pork chops were bland so I decide to fix this first. To the flour mixture I added 1 tsp. of minced onion, 1 tsp. of onion powder, dash of onion salt, 1 tsp. garlic powder, dash of garlic salt, and dash of paprika. To the liquid mixture I added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, 1/2 cup of red wine instead of brandy, and 1 tbls of brown sugar. I only poured in 3/4 cup of orange juice not the 1 1/2 cups it called for. I let it marinate for 1 hour, then I cooked for 2 hours. The pork chops were the best. The sauce was not to thick or too thin just perfect. The pork chops were tender and juicy cooked to perfection. They also had the right amount of seasoning incorporated into the flour mixture so they were not bland. Our first time trying this recipe and definitely not the last done with my adjustments.

My family loved this and my teenager wants me to cook it again. I was surprised at how tender the meat was but this may be due to the fact that I used thin pork chops instead of thick. I added some garlic powder to the flour and chopped garlic to the onion saute. To add thickness to the sauce, I sprinkled the remaining flour mixture onto the browned pork chops and mixed it in with the orange juice sauce.  Because the pork chops were thinner, I reduced the cooking time to 30 minutes.  the chops were so tender and tasty.

This recipe was pretty good.  We followed it exactly, except for the brandy (we used another kind of alcohol we had on hand).  

The only problem was the there was alot of extra onions & sauce when it came out of the oven.  We might fix it again.

The whole family really enjoyed these chops.  Instead of pouring the juice directly into the casserole, I added it to the fry pan along with the onions and brandy and let it boil for about 5 or 10 minutes until it reduced a little.  I also added about 1/2 tsp ginger to the orange juice but I think the next time I'm going to add a little more ginger (maybe a tsp or more) as there wasn't a very strong ginger taste.  But it was really good none the less.

I made this recipe with my 11 year old daughter- it was very easy! We opted to omit the brandy and used thinner pork chops to speed things along. We were very pleased with this interesting recipe-would've scored it a 5 if it had a bit more of a kick to the sauce; maybe the OJ diluted it a little too much.

This is an easy recipe to follow and the taste was great!  I used a the recipe as is execpt tht we only had 2 pork chops so extra sauce and onions - yum.  The pork chop was moist and tender and the flavor was a wonderful blend of ginger and orange, neither was overpowering.

Despite the many negative reviews of this recipe, I decided to give it a whirl and was please with it.  I used peach pucker instead of brandy, but I doubt it really added or detracted from the flavor since it was only a little bit.  Since the liqueur did not deglaze the pan enough, I added some of the orange juice to the pan to finish the job.  That may have imparted some more flavor, which may be why I didn't find it as bland as some.  I also used a heaping teaspoon of salt in the flour mixture

This is the best way to prepare pork chops!

I have made this for years, my family loves it!
The pork is tender and very flavorful!  Adding Brandy is a grat idea and enhances the taste!  I also use fresh Ginger
if I have it handy.  
This is full of Flavor!

Very easy...used some of the suggestions in the reviews...added garlic powder to the flour mix, garlic to the onions and red wine vinegar instead of brandy. I only used 1 cup of oj and it was perfect! I would use less ginger next time.

My family has never tried a recipe like this before and I was a little nervous.  My kids are 6,8,10,12 and my husband is a picky eater too. But it was a success.  We even had my sister in law over with her boyfriend and they liked it too.

I didn't flour the pork chops, just rubbed in salt, pepper and some powdered ginger.  Browned them, then removed to the casserole dish and did the onions.  In a saucepan I combined the OJ with a T. of Grand Marnier, a tsp of white balsamic vinegar, a tsp of brown sugar, 1/4 tsp of ginger and a couple of tsp of cornstach to thicken. My husband really liked it, but I think it could still use a little more zing.  Next time I think I'll add a bit more vinegar and perhaps some fresh minced ginger.

To each his own, I guess.  I enjoyed this recipe, although the prep/cooking time was a bit long.  My husband really like it.  I added a little corn starch to the OJ sauce to thicken it before pouring onto the pork chops and onions.  Thanks for a different way to serve pork chops!

I just tried this one and it had a nice flavor a little muted but nice. The one thing I did not like at all was the flour made it slimy. I think I will try it next time without the flour and just rub the seasoning on before browning. I think I will also try using concentrated OJ and just a little water to give a more intense flavor.

I found this recipe about 5 minutes before I was going to start cooking up some pork steaks for dinner.  I wanted something a bit different, and found this simple and tasty recipe!  It worked out beautifully!  I changed the recipe a bit to yield just two servings.  I'm not that big of an onion fan, but after baking in the orange juice for 45 minutes, the onions were so delicious!  I poured a bit of the orange juice sauce over basmati rice and served it with these very delicious pork steaks.  Excellent!

I can only bring myself to give this three stars. I had high hopes as the smell of this dish while in the oven was wonderfully overwhelming, but was a bit dissapointed that the flavor was lacking.

The smell in my kitchen while this pork chops are baked, it is amazing!
I didn't used flour, instead ground cloves just enough to rub them with two drops of olive oil.
Also used half of yellow onion and other half of red onion..
1/4 cup Brandy

This was very good. I made it for myself and my husband and we loved it! The only change I would make was adding some extra salt and ginger. The orange juice can be a tad bit overpowering, so I wouldn't use as much. But over all a very good recipe.

Sorry but I made it and my husband talked the entire time about how if he weren't hungry he wouldn't eat it. Normally I would have been irritated but this time I agreed fully.

I don't know what went wrong, but this recipe was terrible. The pork came out terribly tough and the sauce had absolutly no flavor. I followed the recipe as stated, but wouldn't be tempted to try again.

No flavor at all.  I let the pork chops cook about 30 min longer and they were very tender, you could almost cut them with a fork, but it still didn't help the lack of flavor.  The sauce was very watery, so after I removed the chops I added some flour.  Will never make again.

The pork came out tender, but I didn't find much flavor.  Probably just add more seasonings and it would be a great recipe.

My husband really liked this (commenting it was "excellent"), and I liked it very much too. This is a good starting recipe, one which benefits from some tweaking. I'm glad I used the suggestions of others in terms of using far less orange juice, and adding some worcestershire sauce and minced garlic.  I used fresh chopped ginger, next time I think I'll use ground (powdered ginger)--it'll just work a lot better in the shaking bag.

Thought I'd try something different with pork and saw this with an orange sauce, sounded rather interesting. It cooked up well, but was a bit disappointed with final results. The only thing I changed was deleted the brandy as I didn't have any, didn't think 15ml would make much of a difference. Will try again, but with some tweaking, not sure at this stage what I'd change though. Served with steamed vegies and mustard mash.

the breading did become soggy in the juices and it was bland. It was also not easy to cut, but was tender when u chewed it. So, added more salt,onion powder and garlic powder and baked it for an addt'l 20min and spooned some of the juice over the meat.  That extra gave it more flavor and it was tender to cut.

Good meal if you like OJ. The kids enjoyed the taste however it was to much for my husband. I only had Sunny D next time I will tried 100% OJ and less. Was not watery since I used a tablespoon of cornstarch as stated by other reviews. Overall it did have a good and different flavor for chops. Also I cooked addtion 15 mins and the meat was very tender.

Good flavor until I used the orange juice. It was very strong on the orange juice side. I would suggest not using as much orange juice as the recipe calls for. Seriously - a dab will do ya!

I very loosely followed the recipe.   Didn't have ginger, balsamic or brandy so I used garlic and soy sauce.  I did use the oj.   Came out completely different flavor than intended but it was very good.  Kids ate it - that's usually testimony to add it to my recipe box.

I loved the taste. Not a lot of flavor, though. The meat stayed moist. My Husband did not like the flavor of the sauce and did not think it had enough flavor on the meat. So 4 stars, not too bad!

Just like the movies, I am always intrigued with mixed reviews, which this recipe certainly received. I wanted to make it exactly as indicated to be able to judge the recipe fairly - when I was getting the ingredients ready, I realized our orange juice was all gone, and so I had to substitute a orange, mango, peach juice blend (it was all I had on hand). Regardless, the recipe was good - I did use 1 cup as others had suggested, and I baked the chops for 30 minutes. I'd probably give the recipe 3 1/2 stars, but because of the juice substitute think it deserves to be rounded up to 4 (and I'll use oj next time to test that assumption). The flavour was good, the meat tender and the recipe fast to prepare.

This recipe was excellent. I made it for my mother and husband (a very picky eater). It was moist and tender! I only made a couple changes: I tried a new (for me) spice Stubb's Rosemary-Ginger Spice Rub (2tsp) instead of straight ginger and omitted the blk pepper. I didn't have any brandy so splashed in some bourban. I used every bit of the 1.5 C of OJ. The sauce was a little runny, and next time I might mix in some of that left over seasoned flour and thicken it up before serving, but the sauce was still great over rice.
I will be making this again!

I made this exactly as described. Maybe it was the fresh orange juice, but when I tasted the sauce it reminded me strongly of acidic vomit. I was worried that I would not be able to serve this. I doctored the sauce using brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic powder, worstershire, and some corn starch to thicken. It began to taste like sweet and sour sauce. The end product was OK over basmati rice, but we did not care for the meat. Sorry.
