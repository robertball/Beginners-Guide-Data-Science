Very good use of spice but I ended up adding more salt.  I pureed the tomatos and onions.  I hate to not follow recipes the first time I make them but I needed to get more protein into this  meal.  I added a pound of chicken and cooked it in the sauce with the beans until the chicken was done.  It turned out very well.

Rating for taste is ***** but the misdirections (how much cardamon, slice or chop the onions, how much chili powder, etc.) drop it a notch.
     I used dried kidney beans (3 parts water to 1 part beans) and cooked the whole thing for about 90 minutes until the beans were done.  They absorb the flavor of the spices and probably contributed to the taste of this wonderful dish.

Don't know how the kiddies would like it, but I feel it is a wonderful recipe.  25 minutes and it's on the table, plus it tastes absolutely wonderful.  Spiced perfectly, and it didn't need any extra help (aside from the garam masala!).  I used canned plum tomatoes and the tomato juice to beef it up a bit, but I'm sure water would be fine. 
 
Thanks for the great recipe! I'll make it many times for those nights when I'm in a rush.

Delicious and easy!  Be careful when doubling (or tripling) the recipe.

This vegetarian recipe packs a nice spicy punch after an initial sweet taste.  We were pleased with this and will be making it again.  We did not have whole cloves or a cinnamon stick so we substituted 1/2 tsp each of ground cloves and cinnamon and this seemed to be appropriate.

great dish! After reading the reviews, I added a bit more cinnamon. I also used canned whole tomatoes as I had no fresh ones on hand and used dried beans instead. After soaking them overnight I cooked the dish for 1h30min and all the flavors blended very well. Will definitely make again.

I just made this recipe.  It's pretty good.  Although, the spices seem to be outweighed by the volume of tomatoes and onions.  I would add probably double the peppercorns, cloves and a little more cinnamon (maybe a touch ground).  Also, the recipe doesn't specify the amount for cardamoms.  I used two cardamoms and a pinch of asafetida (tiny bit only!).  I would make it again with the variations above.

this is great for restricted diets, eat with the cumin rice and it is great. I freeze it with the rice and then take it to work the next day. It keeps very well, the flavours just get better.

If you use your food processor and already have cooked beans, this is not too time consuming.  But it really is nothing special.  I won't make it again and used the rest in chili to get rid of it.

Decent at first; the leftovers were better/good.  There were too few kidney beans compared to other stuff in the recipe -- it doesn't look anything like rajmah I've had in restaurants.  Once I understood that the dish was not what I think of as rajmah, I appreciated it.   I think the recipe was underspiced: I needed to add more spices at the end, probably ending up doubling the amount of spices.  (Incidentally, the spices I added at the end were in ground form).  On the other hand, judging by how much my apartment smelled of spices the next few days, perhaps my complaint about the lack of spicing could simply be from getting used to them from standing by the stove for too long.  Also, the taste ended up oddly interestingly sweet.  The cilantro garnish didn't do much.   The timing of the recipe is surprising.  The recipe says to "saute until almost dry."  Maybe my tomatoes were unusually juicy, but that took me 45 minutes of simmering.  Later the recipe suggested adding water if necessary.  I didn't bother.  Also, the onions took ten minutes to become translucent.   By the way, it takes a few inches of ginger root to make two tablespoons of minced ginger.   Incidentally, I used a non-stick skillet and so only used one tablespoon of oil.  Also, I skipped the optional powdered pepper.

this is excellent and very similar to true "authentic" punjabi-style kidney beans i grew up on! i made a few changes that worked great: i substituted olive oil for canola oil (just to be a bit healthier). i added a cup of fresh spinach which complimented the beans nicely. instead of cumin powder, i sauteed cumin seeds along with the garlic and onion for a more authentic "indian" taste. i also left out the cinnamon, added a bay leaf, turmeric and red chili powder to taste for a nice kick. one of my all-time favorite indian dishes...delicious!

Loved it!  Served with Chicken with Indian Spices (Low-carb.  Cardamom was not listed in ingredients.  Good without.  Didn't have red kidney beans so used cannellini beans successfully.  Yum.  can't wait to make again.

This was soo good. Full of flavour and really affordable, I made it with the things I already had in my kitchen.

I used half the amount of tomato and onion it called for and added some chopped up carrot. Great dish, quick and nutrient packed. My boyfriend loved it too.

This was a great side to my Indian meat dish I was serving. I love all the spices, but I didn't quite follow the amount of onion and tomatoes.  I used 1/2 a large onion and 4 plum tomatoes.  The spices weren't too strong with this amount so I think that if I used the amount in the recipe I would add to the spices.

This is like an Indian spiced chili. It was interesting and unusual. Better the next day! Otherwise, the beans don't really have time to absorb much of the flavor. This is a very spicy hot dish, so 1 t of cayenne might be too much. I used about 1/2 t and it was really hot.

Hi! thanks for the basic instructions, the recipe turned out swell. Just some minor changes to keep in mind: - add the ginger and garlic after the onions have browned, with 2 slit green chillies - I added a little garam masala along with chilli powder - I added just a cup of water (warmed up in the micro) Topped up with lots of fresh cilantro. Tasted great with brown rice.

This is my I can't be bothered cooking standby. There's something about it that just makes me want to gobble the whole lot. Just make sure you remove all the cloves before serving!

Yummy, yummy mix of spices. I didn't have the whole spices except the peppercorns, and I just added the ground spices. My kids liked it, too. I served it with plain rice and yogurt to help cut the spiciness for our more sensitive palettes. A wonderfully different way to eat beans, which we are always trying to add to our diet.

Just made this tonight and loved it, but made a few changes.  I used ghee in place of the canola oil, use 2 green and 1 black cardamom pod (love the taste and perfume it provides), used 1 28oz can of peeled whole tomatoes since tomatoes are out of season (I crushed the tomatoes and cooked them until they were mostly dry, which took forever), added 1 tsp of garam masala, forgot the cilantro, and pureed everything with a hand blender before adding the kidney beans.  I found including all the optional steps were delicious, necessary, and worth the time.     I highly recommend mincing most of the ingredients and removing the woody spices (cinnamon, cardamom, cloves) for blending.

Yummy!  I like spicy and this delivered.
It was easy to make - I appreciate the use of whole spices.
It was a great adaptation by short cutting to a ready cooked can of red beans. Its now in my 'make it again file'.

This was my first Indian dish from scratch.  I did not have cardamom pod, whole clove, peppercorns, or fresh ginger, so I had to use and guess at proper amounts of the powdered versions.  It took a bit of tasting and adjusting, but the dish turned out very good.  Even my wife, who is not highly fond of Indian food, thought it was good.  

I served this over rice with tandoori chicken, naan, and cilantro chutney.  It was a great Indian meal that I would definitely do again.

Very good recipe! I soaked my kidney beans and cooked them in vegetable broth drained and used 2 cups. I also didn't have cardamon pod, so as soon as onions and tomatoes cooked I spinkled about a tablespoon of ground over the onions and tomatoes.  I made twice and my second batch was even better then the first. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is by far one of my FAVORITE recipes..it is amazing! I tripled the recipe and served it with chicken tika masala and rice with cumin and yellow curry powder. An easy sub for Nan is flour tortillas grilled with garlic salt and spices.. I have eaten it for days! I substituted canned organic romas drained and saved the juice to add later as the sauce..only had ground cardamon so i guessed at it like most of my recipes..Great vegetarian dish. Even better after it sits for a few days in the fridge.

Very good. The entire family enjoyed it for dinner and left overs too.

In the directions, it mentioned Cardamom, but didn't in the ingredients - how ,much are you supposed to use?? I ended up leaving this out. Cook time of 5 minutes is way off! I cooked this for 40 minutes to get a thick gravy - without adding any water!! I also took out the cloves and cinnamon stick before serving as i didnt want to bite into one of them.

A bit labor intensive for a side dish, but it is *wonderful*. I give it the highest rating. Goes very well with any Dahl.

We had this on rice, and it was wonderful and surprising! I wasn't sure about all of the ingredients, and find that a lot of veggie recipes sorely lack for meat, but this curry tasted really fresh and satisfying.   I will definitely make this again, especially for those friends who think that a meal isn't complete without meat.

Not bad, but also nothing terribly special.  I had a hard time eating a meal-sized portion, and had no real desire to finish the leftovers.  I'll keep looking for a way to season red beans that makes me want to eat more of them.
