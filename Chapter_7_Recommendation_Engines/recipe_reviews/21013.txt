A good start.  I'd recommend adding cannelini beans and pasta for the full experience. I also substituted some apple cider for some of the liquid - a nice touch in the fall.

Wow! I made this because we are doing an Iron Chef type competition at work and the ingredient was sweet potato. I thought this was interesting. I was not expecting it to be so good! I think I just might win! 


I did use chicken broth instead of vegetable, and I also added some cider as another reviewer suggested and cannelloni beans. I was planning on adding pasta, but, I don''t think it needs it! 

This will wind up in my recipe collection as something I will make regularly.

As a dessert I made the sweet potato pound cake from this site, I fear that gem won't make it out of the house.. At least I got to try this one out without anyone noticing something missing.

UPDATE
I got second place in my contest at work to sweet potato fries with dipping sauces, I wanted a recount! 

People that like sweet potato, and people that don't like soup alike asked for the recipe!

Thsi was really wonderful!  When I placed in front of my kids they thought they were going to hate it--but they loved it!  My husband said, "Honey, you can make this anytime you want!"

I was feeling under the weather, and since I'm a vegetarian, I couldn't go for the stand by classic chicken noodle soup. I found this recipe and decided to give it a try since I'm a big fan of sweet potatoes. Boy, was it delicious! I did make a few changes to make it even more yummy and easy to make.

I only needed one large sweet potato. I used the food processor to slice up the potato thinly, so the cook time would be reduced and the flavor could infuse the broth more easily. I highly recommend using a food processor to do the dirty work for you when you have a lot of vegetables to prepare. I shredded two carrots, sliced 5 stalks of celery, and chopped half of a red onion in a very short period of time. 

I added about a cup and a half of cider to the 4 cans of vegetable broth as one user suggest and I would highly recommend this step. I decided to only add one can of italian tomatoes since the cider added a lot of acidity, as did the apple cider vinegar I added (about 2 tablespoons). Then, to add even more flavor, I added about a 1/3 cup of red cooking wine and 4 tablespoons cooking sherry. 

For spices, I used about 3 tablespoons cumin, 3 teaspoons thyme, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, and then I salt and peppered to taste. I will make this recipe again and again. Its healthy, heart, and it made me feel a whole lot better. This will be my vegetarian substitute for chicken noodle soup most definitely.

I liked this because it tasted great, easy to make, and very versatile. I used peas instead of green beans b/c i didn't have any. I added whole petite baby carrots instead of cutting up a big one. Even my BF liked it, and he hates veggies!

Mmmmmm... what a great soup, really healthy and tasty. I added a lentil mix (red & green lentils with some pearl barley) and it was so good. I didn't have any green beans so added extra celery and I didn't have italian seasoning either so i used oregano, corriander, cumin and a bit of chilli. I only had 1 sweet potato but really wished I had 2, I think it really makes this soup.. Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow! : )

This was a good soup, although I had a couple of unexpected variations that I used.  My local store was out of vegetable broth so I bought the Lipton Vegetable Soup Mix (comes in the box like the Lipton Onion Soup Mix).  I used 2 packages of the veggie soup mix and added 6 cups of water.  And, I was in a hurry and picked up the Italian Style STEWED Tomatoes by mistake instead of the diced.  The sweet potatoes took me forever to peel and cut - they are sooo hard and it doesn't help I'm a pokey chopper.  Maybe next time I'll put them in the micro for a few minutes first to make my life easier.  In the end the soup turned out plentiful and tasty with enough to share with my neighbors and freeze.

THIS SOUP IS AWESOME!!!!! I'm always looking for new vegetarian meals and this is now a favorite! It's a bit time consuming with all the chopping, but totally worth it!!! I makes a lot (there are only 2 of us and no kids), so next time i'll try freezing some. I will definately make this again!

We are in the middle of a blizzard today so this was my lunch choice.  YUM!  Followed the basic recipe.  Substitued asparagus for the beans as that's what was in the fridge.  Added a bit more celery, tossed in some cooked pasta at the end, tossed in a can of water chestnuts for a little crunch, threw in about a half cup of leftover chianti and a box of apple juice in addition to the chicken stock and the juice from the tomatoes.  Nice flavor and texture.  It's just what the doctor ordered!

Loved this! So did my fianc√© who doesn't like sweet potatoes. He ate two bowls. I microwaved the sweet potatoes for about 4 minutes and let them cool to make them easier to peel and cut. I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable. Next time I will cut the sweet potatoes into smaller chunks. Yum!

This soup is okay. It did taste better after I added tobasco to my soup. I guess it's just not my kind of soup, although my husband liked the soup because this soup is "healthy". On the night this soup was made, the tomato flavor overpowered the sweet potato., but on the second night, the sweet potato flavor came through. It took longer than the 30 minutes to make the vegetables tender (unless you like semi-crunchy vegetables). I ended up simmering it for one hour.

Delicious and just what I was looking for, a yummy vegetable soup with sweet potatoes.  I did add a little sweet chili sauce (Mae Ploy is the kind I like).  Just enough for a hint of heat.  I also used a small can of tomato juice in place of one cup of the broth because I wanted to use it up.  I think the combo of the sweet potatoes and the garlic really makes this soup.

Very inventive soup...easy to substitute or add whatever to. I found this trying to find a way to use up leftover sweetpotatoe.  BTW: EASY SWEET POTATOE PEELING METHOD...Slice through the skin all the way around the potatoe at the middle. Kind of alike a sliced belt around the middle. Place in boiling water for about 20 minutes. Take one by one out and place right into a bowl of ice water. Once the skin is cool enough to touch it..pick up the potatoe at the slice and simply squeeze off the skin. Slipps right off and no peeling needed! Saves me tons of time in the kitchen when making any kind of boiled potatoe. Then you can just slice or dice for whatever dish or mash away.

Easy and delicious. I did not cook the veggies (especially the green beans) for as long as was stated because I don't like my veggies too mushy. I also added a can of cannellini beans.

Oh so good! Thanks for a great recipe. I followed the directions (mostly); instead of green beans I added a can of light kidney beans and added a handful of little pasta for the last 8 minutes.  I also put the garlic in at the beginning and sauteed it with the onion and celery.. I also had some fresh basil, chopped it coarsely and sprinkled it over the soup right before serving.    I am already looking forward to leftovers tonight!

Inexpensive, easy, healthy, filling, delicious! This is one of my all-time favorite recipes.  The Italian seasoning and garlic give it loads of flavor, and it reheats perfectly. I usually end up having to add more liquid, and it's better if you cut down on the sweet potatoes and increase the other veggies a bit, but otherwise I make it just as written.

This is fantastic!! Literally, this is one of the better soup bases I've come across. Rather than using 28 ounces of diced tomatoes, I pureed a 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes instead. I needed to add about 1.5 teaspoons of salt at the end to get it properly seasoned. I think next time I'll add some corn and shell pasta.

This was an excellent and very healthy soup! We added tons more vegetables to it (dikon, mushrooms, zucchini, etc.) and it was so good! Great with some parmesan cheese on top, paired with some fresh bread!

Great!  Was a little sweet though.  I added barley and after tasting the sweetness I added vinegar to my individual bowl.  Next time I'll probably add vinegar to taste to the whole pot.

I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead of the diced, and added about another 3 cups of chicken broth because I found it didn't have enough liquid.  I also used mushrooms instead of the beans, and added some extra basil and italian seasoning.  It turned out utterly delicious and was very easy and quick to prepare.  I'll be making this one again!

This was delicious, hearty and healthy!  Only thing I did differently was that I used chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth and also added a few teaspoons of chicken bouillon powder.  Yum!

So delicious, and even better as leftovers.  We made it exactly as is and loved it.  It's a wonderful fall soup.  Super easy to make once you chop up all the vegetables.

Yum. This is different, but I really like it.  My husband doesn't like sweet potatoes, but he liked it too.  I added some apple cider vinegar (about 1 tsp), and I like the flavor even better.

Surprisingly good, even with all the substitutions I had to make. I used only 1 large sweet potato, a 14 oz. can of Rotel instead of the 28 oz Italian tomatoes, peas instead of green beans, 1 T. onion powder instead of onion (I was completely out of onion), 3 cups broth and 1 cup apple cider, no oil, no celery. Very forgiving soup base. I did use the 2.5 t. Italian seasoning, 2 large carrots, and 5 cloves garlic as written. I just dumped everything in the pot and simmered for 30 minutes. Also added 1 cup of spiral pasta about 10-12 minutes from the end. Highly recommend!

This smelt so good when cooking. To me minestrone isn't minestrone unless it has pasta in it so I added in some tiny shells about 10 minutes before the end of cooking. Other than that this is a great soup very flavourful. Thankyou Stormywoman.

This was a good base. We had to season it up a bit. We added about a cup of spinach the last 5 minutes. Really good.

I added a little apple cider vinegar like some other reviewers and extra garlic (don't do that if you don't LOVE garlic-our family does).  Fantastic.  I was out of regular green beans the second time I made this, so I put in frozen mixed veggies.  I was worried about the corn not meshing, but it turned out to make the dish.  It was an extra crunch that I will be sure to use from now on.  The second time I also subbed some of the broth for beef broth and it was even better than the first time.  In the end, it was a really good recipe that ended up fantastic with some tweaking.

Absolutely delicious! And nutritious! Threw in pretty much anything I had (added mushrooms and quinoa during the final 30 minutes) and the soup was amazing.  Note: I did not peel my potatoes and they were just fine.  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe.

I have to say this soup is great!  Next time I will use some sort of noodle and possibly a bean but other than that fantastic.  I took one of the reviewers advice and added a dash of chili powder.  I also used veggie bouillon cubes with sea salt and herbs....DELISH!......no celery because I didn't  have any and I used frozen green beans and only had one sweet on hand but there is still plenty.  This recipe is very versatile and wonderful  The big bonus is that my 19 month old loved loved the veggies out of the soup. Nice.

Love this recipe!  I was worried that the sweet potatoes might sweeten up the soup but it was not terribly sweet when done. Next time I might add lentils and maybe some shredded chicken.  I can't wait for spring so I can try this recipe with fresh herbs!

Very good!  I loved the Italian seasonings in it, it was a perfect blend with the veggies.  I omitted sauteing my celery and onions in the oil, (to cut the fat), and instead just used a couple T. of veggie broth to soften up the celery and onion.  I will make this again adding some white kidney beans for some protein, to make it more of a complete meal.

A great variation on a traditional minestrone soup!  In the future I might add some extra vegetable broth because there is so much other "stuff" that goes in it.

Man, did I feel healthy eating this! My husband really liked it. Of course we served it with crusty bread. I took it down one star because I thought it was really sweet. I'd like to make it again and am wondering how to make it a little less sweet. Add vinegar? Not sure.

My family loved this recipe, from the 3 year old up to the 26 year old, and including my husband. One son only took a small amount to start because he thought sweet potato soup sounded weird, but he soon came back for a big bowl and said it was great soup! He also commented that it was sweet. I could have eaten the broth alone, it was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly (I did add the minced garlic at the beginning with the onion) until the end when I added a can of garbanzo beans (all I had) and some pasta like others suggested. With or without the additions my family would have enjoyed it. Thank you!

The broth was really tasty. I used one large sweet potato and any more would have been way too much. Definately could have used some beans, pasta or rice.

This was a big hit! I was short on many ingredients, but it still worked out well. Only had green onion, no celery, only had chicken broth on hand. I did not have italian seasoning so I just threw in whatever dried herbs I could find. This was seriously so good!

The best soup I ever made...though I don't think that's saying too much. ;-)  It came out wonderful.  I didn't know what "Italian Seasoning" meant, so I put in oregano, sage, thyme, and chervil.  It was still wonderful!

Very tasty soup, especially on a cold Winter evening.  I used olive oil rather than veg oil.  I skipped the Italian seasoning.  And I lessened the veg broth to 4 cups, to make it thicker and more stew like.  It's really very hearty and yummy.  Next time I will add beans.

I LOVE this soup!  I don't use veg oil to sautee, instead I just use veggie stock & I sautee the onions & carrots, then add some more stock & the beans (don't like them too hard) and then I add everything else.  I also ADD about 1c barley & 1/2 box ditilini (tiny soup pasta) and it's just hardier and soooo yummy!  I also put about 4 sweet potatoes and make a larger batch so I can share with family and friends...they love it!

This was good!  I don't think I've ever had sweet potatoes in a soup before.  I added some noodles and next time think I may add some beans to help balance out the sweetness.  Will make again!

This is a very healthy and tasty soup! I made it pretty much as written, except I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and regular tomatoes instead of Italian-style. Other than that, I didn't change a thing! This soup came out really well...I wasn't sure how I was going to like sweet potatoes in a tomato based soup, but I discovered that I LOVE it! Thanks so much for sharing this wonderfully tasty, hearty, healthy, and altogether delicious soup recipe! I'm definitely going to make it again!!!!

This soup is great. I made it for some kids I was watching, they were still eating when there mom walked in. I announced that the kids were eating sweet potato soup and her jaw dropped. Seems her kids 'hate' anything potato. Her daughter spoke up and said she only likes potatos in "this soup" and that is it! Followed the recipe to the 'T' save for adding beans and serving over rottini pasta.

Normally we do not like sweet potato but this soup is wonderful.  The entire family likes it.   It is filling low on the calorie count and I have yet to serve it anyone who did not ask for the recipe.  I do add some cured ham chunks for my husband but it is good with our without the ham.

I thought it was a little too sweet.  Most likely wouldn't make it again, but overall, it's a great concept and different way to utilize sweet potatoes.

My husband loved this soup (he doesn't really like most of what I make). I forgot to add the tomatoes so it was sweet (even without adding sugar). Next time I'll make it with the tomatoes ;). This is definitely in our rotation

A new 5 star recipe!  I love soup & was looking for something new & different.  This is it!  I simplified this recipe a little by not sauting any of the vegetables.  I mixed everything together & added noodles at the very end. I used canned tomatoes that had onion & garlic in them.  I cut the Italian seasoning back to 3/4 tsp. I added 2 c. shredded chicken & used 7c. chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth.  I also used 1 can of green beans.

Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum!!!!  This has got to be the absolute BEST recipe I have EVER tried from All Recipes.  I am not a fan of the traditional sweet potato so I got on here to try and find a new way to cook it as it is an incredibly healthy veggie to consume.  When I stumbled onto this recipe it was a Godsend!!  The first time I made it I accidentally picked up chopped tomatoes with chiles rather than the Italian seasoned tomatoes that the recipe calls for.  It turned out brilliantly:)  When my family came to visit I made it with the Italian seasoned tomatoes as called for because I know my parents DO NOT appreciate spicy food.  It was good this way as well, but when cooking for myself I will continue to use the tomatoes with chiles and I would highly recommend this substitute for anyone who likes their food a little on the spicy side.  I would also follow the advice about garlic bread.  Garlic bread compliments this recipe beautifully and I wouldn't serve it without it:)

This soup was great!  I added 2 packages of knorr vegetable soup mix and also took the suggestions from previous reviewers and added pasta.  The soup was very tasty especially because of the sweet potatoes. I tripled the recipe and froze the remaining.

I loved this! I'm not a huge fan of sweet potatoes (except in the form of PIE!), but they are so incredibly good for you, not to mention that they were only 16 cents a pound at Walmart before Thanksgiving. I've been trying out new ways to use them. This soup has been my favorite so far. The sweet potatoes absorb so much of the seasoning flavor, the actual sweet potato flavor was very subtle. I liked that. Like others, I added a can of beans (white beans) and about a cup of macaroni. Most of my family enjoyed it, too, but those who didn't are picky so they hardly count! Try this one. You won't be disappointed!

I thought this was okay. I enjoyed enough for a serving or two, but was less than excited to eat it for a couple more days (makes a HUGE batch). I added 1 can of garbanzos, which I didn;t think would make that much of a difference so I didn't sdjust the liquid. It turned out more like CHUNKY vegetable stew. I like veggies a lot, especially sweet potatoes, but if I make this again I might half the recipe so I am not stuck eating it for days. I would give it 3.5 stars if I could.

This is absolutely fantastic! Usually I find soups pretty bland until the day or two after I've made them, but not this one. Made exactly as directed other than adding a can of white kidney beans at the end and only because I wanted a little protein so it was more of a complete meal. The soup would have been just as good without them. I will be making this often.

This soup has quickly become one of my all time favorites, mostly because it can be varied in so many ways. If I have an abundance of zucchini - into the soup pot, no carrots - I add more sweet potato. The spices can varied according to season as well, and you can make huge quantities very easily.

Yummy!  I followed the recipe except for replacing green beans with pea pods.  I added navy beans and pasta before serving.  Thank you for the delicious recipe! My husband and kids loved it. Update: instead of adding cooked pasta before serving, this time I added polenta "dumplings" (really just polenta dropped in by the spoonful)... mmm, delicious!

This was very, very good! With a few small tweaks, I'd easily give it five stars. I added a can of strained corn to mine, as well as a can of white kidney beans. I also added more seasoning than the recipe called for, but that's just a personal preference. It was one of the side dishes at Christmas dinner, and was absolutely to die for with a bit of cut up ham tossed into the bowl. I will definitely make this again, everyone loved it.

This tasted absolutely delicious! The slightly sweet flavor of the sweet potatoes coupled with the tomatoes and seasonings were wonderful. I halved the recipe because my family of four doesn't eat much. I used 1/3 of a large onion, 1 stalk celery, 15 oz can diced tomatoes, 2 1/2 cups water, 2 bouillon cubes, 1 large sweet potato, 2 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning, 1 tsp salt, no carrots and no green beans, 1/2 tsp granulated garlic and 1 small zucchini.

Fantastic soup! It is soooo delicious! I tripled the recipe and froze some in containers. I added 2 cans of chickpeas and i can of drained black beans, a pinch of cumin and cayenne pepper. I also added 2 small cans of tomato paste to get a stronger tomato taste. This was great!

This was a good soup but a little too much tomato for me.  Don't think I will make it again but if I do, I'll use petite diced tomatoes and let it simmer longer overall.  I loved the sweet potatoes although I think I would add them a little later in the cooking process.  Mine were a bit too soft for my taste.  Also, I'd do like some of the other reviewers suggested and add some pasta.

This turned out superb! To make it easier, I put the garlic, onions and celery in the food processor and used frozen green beans and carrots. I only had about a teaspoon of Italian seasoning so I used half a teaspoon of dried basil. Just the right balance of flavours! Great served with crusty bread.

This was  a great way to use up a sweet potato and to vary my usual minestrone. I  didn't have Italian spice so I added dried oregano, cumin, parsley and  basil-probably a tablespoon total of the dried herbs and a teaspoon of cumin. I also salted the veggies while saut√©ing them. I think the soup needed the extra spices and turned out great.

I waited to add the green beans until the last 15 minutes so they weren't overdone.  I also added cooked elbow noodles at the end then let is set for about 3 hours.  I topped with fresh parsley when served.  The dish was a hit with the whole family, including the kids.  I will definitely make this again.

Awesome soup. It was perfect when made as the recipe read. I will be adding some fresh spinach next time though and maybe some cannellini beans. It was great the first night and even better after it set in the fridge.

Edited to add: Ok, I made this again and added an Italian  squash, cannelline beans & some fresh spinach. It was even better than the first time. This will be a new go to for me, perfect with a slice of crusty bread on a cool night.

This is my go-to soup recipe.  So much more than the sum of its parts!  I've made it many many times - sometimes exactly as written, sometimes with variations because I have different veggies on hand - but it's always delicious.

Great recipe! We have made it twice now, I added some apple cider in place of chicken broth and it was so good! I recommend trying it, and add the white canned beans minus the juice to the mix. We have also played around with different veggies, added mushrooms. All in all a fantastic recipe that we will use regularly! Thanks for sharing.

A good soup. Minestrone is not my favorite, but this is a neat take on it. Sweet potatoes take over the role of starch in this soup, instead of noodles and/or beans. Definitely use fresh green beans. They are a nice touch.

I was surprisingly impressed. Great recipe. I changed a couple things. Added one can of rinsed and then pur√©ed cannelloni beans. Extra crushed garlic and chopped onions. Browned up a few sausage slices so my husband would eat it. He ended up having two bowls. And I put all the ingredients in my crockpot and cooked it all day in there. I sprinkled the servings with a little parmesan cheese. It was great. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

Picky husband loved it... enough that he even took some to his parents (high praise that he thinks they would eat it!).  Could have used a few more minutes for the carrots and green beans.  I added cooked elbow noodles the last 2 or 3 minutes.

Good starter recipe. Just throwing a few more things in makes it excellent. Used olive oil to saut√© the onions, celery, garlic and some fennel. Added about a tbsp of basil, and some oregano, parsley, thyme and marjoram. Also added about a tbsp of crushed red pepper. Once the tomatoes and broth boil I added the sweet potatoes and carrots.  After that bubbled for a while I added some cannelllini beans, frozen peas and Lima beans and finally a handful of ditalini pasta. Really good. Better the next day and freezes well.

This was SO good with the following alterations.  Instead of olive oil I used garlic infused olive oil.  Instead of veg broth I used 3.5 C Veg broth & 1.5 C chicken broth.   I did the green beans in ¬Ω inch sizes and instead of garlic cloves I used minced garlic where ¬Ω tsp. = 1 clove.  And I did heaping tsps. full.  For the sweet potatoes I did one orange/yam type and one white.  But it was SO good we are going to do it again.  Though will dice the potatoes smaller next time, so they cook faster because it took about 20 min longer.

I actually hate sweet potatoes due to childhood trauma (think day care and canned sweet potatoes), however, I wanted to see if there was a way I could like them.  This was it!  As usual I doubled the garlic.  I also accidentally doubled the Italian seasoning but it worked.  I used low sodium veggie stock because the wife is trying to cut down on salt.  This was easy to make and paired nicely with my other vegan courses (Quinoa Black Beans and Balsamic Strawberries).  It definitely needs to cook a bit longer even with small sweet potato cubes (I slice them and use a "chop magic" to do this efficiently and evenly).  Both of us sweet potato eaters ate the whole bowl!

Wanted a veg. soup recipe that would help me use up a sweet potato. As others said, I was skeptical just reviewing the ingredient list that it would be something crazy delicious - but it really was. Very good. Exactly what I was looking for and could easily be changed based on what you have on hand and would still be just as good, I think.

I made a double batch of this soup for a fall-themed baby shower, and it was loved by ALL! I was asked to email everyone the recipe! I added some seashell pasta, but other than that, didn't change a thing, and it was FABULOUS!

Agreed that white beans or lentils would've made this a full entree with protein.  Used homemade veggie broth for a delicious no preservative, gluten free vegan meal. Also subbed peas for green beans for the kids.  Will make this a lot!  Served with a side of homemade gluten free bread brushcetta.  Perfect!  Thanks for posting :)

Delicious!  Perfect meatless option to have during Lent and full of veggies.  My family doesn't really like sweet potatoes but they are so good for us.  This is one of the few recipes I can make with sweet potatoes that everyone will actually eat.  My mom, who loves sweet potatoes, gobbles this recipe up.

For a vegetable soup, this is pretty good. I added some white beans to bulk it up a bit. This recipe makes a ton - easily 7+ servings for us - so I'll be eating it all week, but I don't think I'll make it again. Thanks anyway!

This was weird, to me.  I like everything in it, but just not together.  The family said they liked it, but no one went back for seconds (unusual) and the leftovers sat in the fridge.  Really disappointing.  Also, as someone else mentioned, it's not even Minestrone unless you don't have beans and pasta.  It's just vegetable soup.  Sweet vegetable soup.

I really enjoyed this soup! It was great on a cold night. I kept to the recipe except I pureed the sweet potato. A soup I'm proud to serve my toddlers! Next time I'll cut down on the broth a bit and add more pureed sweet potato for a creamier texture.

Everyone loved this! I added a little more garlic and a few drops of tabasco for an extra punch. It is loaded with vegies and anti-oxidants. My daughter couldn't stop eating this and said it was the best vegetable soup she ever ate! I loved it too.

Delicious!  Only change is that I browned some Italian sausage in the pot before I added the onions.  Also, I added the sweet potatoes after all the other veggies, as some others mentioned that the sweet potatoes cook a little faster.  It turned out amazing, and even my 4 year old daughter asked for seconds.  Thank you for this great recipe!

This is very good! I used about half vegetable stock, half turkey stock (made this after Thanksgiving) and since I was using leftover steamed green beans, I added them during the last ten minutes of cooking.  I also used a Tuscan blend seasoning mix and I added a cup of whole wheat seashell pasta in the last ten minutes also.  I was going to add some kidney beans, but held off.  This made such a big batch that it would be easy to toss some in later to change things up a bit for a serving or two.  Overall, I thought this was hearty but healthy, and very flavorful.

This is absolutely outstanding!  Quite frankly, I was not expecting to like it; I only made it to use up some produce.  It was exceptionally good-the sweetness of the sweet potatoes was terrific.  The bonus was that it was so healthy I didn't have to feel guilty about eating it!

I joined All Recipies just so I could comment on this recipie. My daughter is vegitarian so I am always looking for healthy recipies to make for her that we will all like. The closest thing I could find to "Italian style tomatoes " was canned tomatoes for brushetta but other than that I followed the recipie as written. Wow what an amazing healthy tasty hearty soup and its so easy to make.   Thank you  Pete

Wonderful.  I left out the green beans and added cannelloni beans.  I also added some curry sauce that I had ling around (about a cup), and it was still missing something so I added a little bit of cinnamon (to taste) and it was perfect!  They didn't have you saute the carrots with the onions and celery, like a classic mirepoix, so the carrots were al dente.  But, there are few things in cooking I hate more than mushy carrots, so it was perfect for me.  I also did not slice the carrots very thin, so that would have contributed.

Delicious on a cold day.  I made a big batch of it and then put 1/2 in the fridge, 1/2 in the freezer - easy to pull out later.  I also added some small dumplings (just flour and water mixed and dropped by the spoonful into the boiling soup) and topped with feta cheese crumbles when I was ready to eat.

This soup was delicious! The sweet potatoes made it different than your traditional minestrone soup-in a good way! I forgot to add the green beans, but it didn't matter.  It lasted me (1 person) for over a whole week.

I didn't have very high expectations of this soup, even after reading all the good reviews.  I was very pleasantly surprised at how tasty it turned out.  This was very easy to make and my husband and I both loved it.  I did make a couple changes b/c I didn't have everything the recipe called for.  I used a cup of chopped green cabbage instead of the celery, Italian style stewed tomatoes instead of diced, and I added a can of cannelini beans for some protein.  I would definitely make this again.

The sweet potato and Italian seasoning were SO good and made my kitchen smell wonderful as the soup was simmering...I used a different selection of veggies: onion, celery, white potato, green beans, shredded cabbage, and tomato.  Chicken broth for liquid. I'd make it the same way next time except maybe omit the white potato and just use all sweet potato.  I simmered a lot longer (45 mins) but I cut the potatoes bigger than the dice that the recipe instructed.  Had a small bowl of this soup but HAD to go back for more.

The only changes I made were the addition of a can of cannelloni beans and chicken stock instead of vegetable.  I don't quit understand what all the raves were about.  To me this tasted ok, but seemed like it was missing something, but certainly not sweet potatoes!  My sweet potatoes were large and there were way too many for my liking.   Also it was a little heavy in the Italian seasoning department.  I have lots left over and hopefully the flavors will meld a little and it will taste better as leftovers.  I don't think I'll make this one again.

Loved it.  After we ate about half of it I added free range turkey sausage I had cooked up and it created a whole new soup. Quick and healthy recipe I will add to my recipe box.

Absolutely incredible. I'd have never thought to use sweet potatoes in a soup like this, but now I don't think i can cook them any other way. My only suggestion is that you keep the garlic powder and salt/pepper on hand throughout, as it started off a little bland and i found myself adding more seasoning every time i stirred it.

Yum! Just made this for dinner... had to make a few substitutions. I didn't have celery, green beans, or Italian seasoning, stewed tomatoes. I had to improvise. I made my soup with sweet potatoes, onions, garlic, beans, carrots, shitake mushrooms, and some asian greens. I seasoned it with salt, pepper, and a few dashes of thyme. (I am a bit off on ingredients since I am living in Japan) But it turned out great! And I have tons left for lunch and dinner tomorrow.

So yummy and hearty!  I added kidney beans as well, just to add some protein.  Even my picky eaters ate a good dinner, which means that this one is definitely going into the rotation at our house!

Excellent! I followed another reviewer suggestion and added canelloni beans and whole wheat pasta. I also added 1 tsp. fresh chopped thyme and 1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes for a little kick. It was a huge hit in my house and a perfect fall recipe for a hearty and healthy dinner. Thanks!

This recipe was fabulous!  I used both tomato and chicken boullion powder to make my broth instead of using prepared broth.  It did turn out a little sweet as another person mentioned but I liked it because it was something new and different.

Very nice soup.  It makes a ton, so although I'm taking half to a friend of mine who's sick, I'm glad I didn't make more than the one batch.  I don't have celery, so I just left it out, but everything else was in my pantry and fridge so I went with it.  I added one can of kidney beans for a bit of protein but left the rest the same.  I served with Chedder Beer Triangles, and it went perfectly with them.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this.  Did add lentils to it per another review.  Quick and easy to make.  Am going to try freezing some of the leftovers for a quick meal.  Also used chiken broth because that is what I had on hand.

This was a really good soup! The only change I made was halving the amount of diced tomato; I think that a large 28 oz can would have been too much.

This was a pretty good basic soup.  It was a good way to use up some sweet potatoes I had and it's definitely healthy.  I did leave out the onions due to allergies and added two cans of chickpeas for some protein.  I am happily enjoying the leftovers right now!  I'd make it again if I had to use up some more sweet potatoes.

Nice why to eat Sweet Potatoes!  Very nice soap.  Substituted peas for green beans, and pork breast bone broth.  The pork and sweet potatoes were a nice blend.

I was a little skeptical about making this soup when I first read the recipe. However, the sweet potatoes gave nice sweetness and aroma into the soup. It was really delicious. My family gave 5 stars as well.

This is a great recipe while our family is on lent. It was very easy to make, and the flavors combined perfectly. I didn't have any stock so i added some vegetable soup seasoning and it came out perfect. I also added about a cup of water extra because I think I added more vegetable quantity than it called for. I will make this again :)

I'm not a sweet potato fan, but my husband loves them so I gave this a try.  What a great recipe!  Full of good fresh vegetable flavor.  I substituted sliced zucchini for the green beans, but otherwise made as posted.  I was not sure that 30 minutes was enough cooking time, but all of the vegetables came out tender.

I had never put sweet potatoes in soup before, was a skeptic, but now I'm sold on it.I used chicken broth because it's what I had on hand. I dropped in a couple bay leaves, used regular tomatoes instead of Italian, added three medium peeled and chopped russet potatoes, and some frozen peas. I kept everything else the same. Hearty and satisfying. A keeper!

Let me clarify this three star rating:  This is a GREAT vegetarian recipe as written - however, my carnivore family LIKED it - they just didn't LOVE it...and its not because they need meat in every meal. Rather, they felt it lacked "heartiness."  I made this same recipe again last night but used some macaroni noodles IPO barley and it was received much better the 2nd time.  If you really need meat - I can imagine chicken would be a great addition.  Another reason for the three stars - the sweet potato is suppossed to be the star of the soup, but really - with the Italian seasonings and tomatoes - the sweetness of the potato is too subtle. I could have subbed any potato in there and I doubt anyone would have known.   That said - if your looking for something new for your stash of sweet potatoes - try this.  I've made this twice and it was worth it both times - just depends how "thick" your family likes their soups! Thanks Stormywoman!

I usually don't like a tomato base soup, but this is very good.  The sweet potato really tames the tomato bitterness and makes the soup just melt away!  Added a handful of dried basil.  Very tasty and a definite keeper!

This soup was awesome!!  My hubby and kids loved it too.  I used yams instead of sweet potatoes and also added chopped red pepper (just because I had it).  I also added a little bit of pasta at then end.  I did add an extra cup of broth because I knew I'd be adding the pasta.  Will definitely make this again!

excellent - I added 1/2 fresh serrano chili finely chopped. The 'first taste' after the 30 minutes simmer was good - the broth was sooo good - and the veggies were nicely cooked but I think needed more time to soak up the spices. The 'second taste' was really good - can't wait til tomorrow! Great way to get a lot of good low cal veggies in!!

I really liked it....but I skipped the tomato and added a radish-actually 2 radishes.
I wasn't in the mood for tomato. Oh, well.

My family loves this recipe! It has become a weekly staple now that its cold out. I usually add more veg stock to add volume to the soup, as well as more veggies. Great for cold days!

This soup had a really good broth, but i really didnt care for the sweet potatos, i did use whute sweet patatos though so maybe that was the problem. but next time i will make it without the potatos and i think it would be awsome. i also added pasta shells to mine.

As a vegan, I really appreciated this recipe!
The only thing that I might do differently when I make this recipe, is add a little more veggies, just because I like a thicker soup.

It was pretty good \debby liked the vegetables cut big.  I think that it would be better if the veg. were cut smaller.  Make sure that the celery are satued really good.

This has a delicious flavor and is so nutritious.  You can personalize it so much. I did as some suggested:  added cannellini beans.  You could add shredded cabbage, pasta, so many things, depending on what you like. Instead of salt I added a tsp. of chicken granules and a pinch of sugar.  Also pureed my tomatoes with the garlic in the food processor, since I had to use Italian style stewed tomatoes that I needed to use up.
