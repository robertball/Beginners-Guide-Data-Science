These cookies are like taking a bite of cake.  They are wonderfully light and fluffy.  I substituted butter flavored shortening for the regular shortening.

I needed a cookie to take to the assisted living facility where my grandma lives.  I chose these because they were different.  I omited the walnuts and added 1 cup of cinnamon chips.  They were wonderful.  The ladies are still raving about these cookies.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I liked this recipe. I do think I will add a little cinnamon next time just for a little more zip.  To me, cinnamon and apples compliment each other.  A soft cookie, don't keep tightly closed.

I think this recipe is a good starting base for apple cookies for me.  After reading through the reviews I changed the recipe as follows.  I used 2 chopped apples, added 1 tsp vanilla, 2 pinches of ground nutmeg, 1 tbsp cinnamon and sprinkled in extra flour, wheat germ and oatmeal to compensate for the extra apple.  I omitted the walnuts (I didn't have any on hand) and the raisins (my kids aren't really raisin fans)and I only used 1 cup of brown sugar.  I then baked 3 cookies as test cookies to see how they would turn out.  They turned out really soft and moist but still lacking in flavor.  So I sprinkled in some more cinnamon and 2 pinches of nutmeg.  They were better.  I think next time though, and there will be a next time, I will use applesauce instead of milk and see how that goes.  Oh and I also baked them in a preheated oven at 350F for 12 minutes, I've never baked cookies at 400F before.

This was pretty good. I only used half the sugar because I added a cinnamon spice drizzle on top, which made it just sweet enough. I only used 4 Tbls. of butter instead of 1/2 cup shortening. I also added 1 tsp. cinnamon powder as suggested by another member. I think I would double the apple next time because I really couldn't taste any. The batter is very dry until the apples are added, then it becomes more like a drop batter. I used parchment instead of a greased cookie sheet and it worked fine.

These are pretty tasty. I took other reviews into account and added homemade applesauce in addition to the apples, and cut the sugar down. I omitted the walnuts/raisins and used butter. Will def. make again if I have spare apples to use up.

Awesome cookies, the softest cookies I have every made!  I would suggest adding a bit more apple than just a cup, and we added about a tsp of cinnamon to the recipe too.

Very good.  I enjoyed them very much.  I did, however, use 1/3 C sugar less.  They turned out rather nice.  :)

Delicious cookies for a fall treat. I made them the night before and wasn't thinking about all the moisture in the cookies so I covered them and the next morning they were very soft/mushy and never returned to their original state. Just remember to keep them uncovered or loosely covered to keep the outer shell a little hardened. I will definitely remember this step next time!

I'm giving it a four for a great base idea.  First and foremost, I wanted the cake texture.  Something sweet and easy for my 2 year old (who doesn't seem to like apples) to eat.  I made the following changes:  reduced to 1 cup of brown sugar, added 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 tbs cinnamon, 1 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp of ground ginger, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp of almond extract, and brought all of my ingredients to room temperature. It came out as the texture of cake but the consistency of a cookie AND my son is eating apple.  I am going to increase the apple next time and definitely add walnuts.  I also think a caramel cream cheese glaze might be in the works.  Yum.

I tried this recipe and used skim milk. It wasn't specified to use whole milk. It was a bit thin and took longer to bake but all in all it is a good recipe.

Way tooooo sweet!  The batter spread out too much and the cookies burned around the edges.  They were not done in the middle.  I was Very disappointed in the recipe.

I agree easy to make, but we found there was not much taste, bland, I to like the other reader used 1/3 less sugar. Sorry but we did not like this.

WAY too sweet! I added 2 tsp of cake spice (a milder version of pumpkin spice...from Penzeys) to give it some flavour. I just could not get past the sweetness to decide if I like it. I may try it again with 1/3 of the sugar.

I did take the advice of some of the reviewers,  I added apple pie spices, and next time I make
them I will double them.  I added allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also added 1 cup of oatmeal.
The vanilla glaze was a perfect addition.

These took longer to bake than expected.  Found that often the bottoms would burn before the center was completely cooked.  Worked out better when I turned the over down 25 degrees and baked a couple minutes longer.  However, they were very, very good when done.

I used shredded local apples and cranberries and these turned out really well. They're very soft and quite surprising. Also, I substituted butter for shortening (1-to-1).

I gave this recipe 5 stars b/c I think its a great way to use up those lingering apples in the crisper. I did add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. My family isn't a fan of icing on cookies so I opted to not drizzle that on top but I did Dr'd it up to use up some other things in my pantry.... coconut & white choc chips..... Everyone really enjoyed them. I lowered the temp to 375 and cooked them a few extra minutes and they were great! Thanks for a great recipe!

Would be 5 stars if I hadn't changed it a bit...I added a tsp of cinnamon had no walnuts and used craisins instead of raisins and reduced to  1 cup of dark brown sugar.  I also added 2 tbls of flaxseed meal soaked in 4 tbls of water for 5 minutes to add to the nutrition. 
I think the original recipe would have been good but a tad bland with no spice...also I can't find the icing recipe...but they are wonderful without!

These are wonderful! Mine came out a bit soft-baked, but they were still delicious!!!!! However, I did add added few extra things (1tsp cinnamon, 1tsp nutmeg, 1tsp ginger and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla).

a bit too sweet and even though I only used 1 cup of brown sugar. My nephew likes them, but what doesn't he like? :\
