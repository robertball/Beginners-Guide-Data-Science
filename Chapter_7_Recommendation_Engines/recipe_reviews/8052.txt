cake turned out to be 1 inch in height and VERY heavy. Thought I'd made a mistake so I made it again....results were the same.

Not what I expected. Very dense heavy cake with an icing that does not match.

In this recipe there is supposed to be 1 1/2 tsp. baking soda in addition to the 1/4 tsp. baking powder. I've used this recipe (with the baking soda) in the past and it is one of the best applesauce cakes I've had.

Clearly salt and leavening amounts are incorrect. Switched them. Makes a nice snacking cake or breakfast cake without the frosting which I agree doesn't match the cake.

A friend of mine made this cake and I agree with Karen the previous reviewer. There is supposed to be 1 1/2 tsp. baking soda as well. The salt and baking powder amounts are correct. My friend left out the raisins and nuts and added 2 apples peeled cored and chopped. She also left off the glaze. (Her recipe for glaze was different.) It was a wonderful moist cake!

This is a wonderful cake. I I'm very happy I read the reviews before I baked it. The recipe is missing a teaspoon and a half of baking soda. I used both the baking powder and baking soda and it was moist and light. I took it out after 55 minutes as it had passed the toothpick test. That variation maybe due to my oven and even then it was a little charred in the corners but still very tasty.
