Great recipe with whole food ingredients. It's perfect recipe for substitutions for those with allergies. I used vegan cream cheese and whipped coconut cream. I separated and whipped the cream from a can of Thai Kitchen's coconut milk. And, any brown rice flour and ground almond recipe will do for the crust. We all loved it.

YUM!!!!! Guilt free healthy dessert! I subbed the 1/4 cup sugar for maple syrup and eliminated the sugar in the whipped cream and it was heavenly! My whole family loved it!

I have made this four times in the past 3 weeks for different occasions and everybody has loved it! They all wanted the recipe. My only change was that I put it in an Oreo crust, and personally, I think it makes for an even tastier pie! My husband says it's a definite "keeper". Thanks for a great recipe!

Yummy.  I drained the juice from the mashed strawberries before adding to mixture because someone commented that it was a little runny.  Turned out perfect!

Awesome recipe and so refreshing. I loved it.  I did not use the graham cracker crust as I hate graham crackers.  I used the Oreo cookie pie crust instead. I use the Oreo cookie pie crust when ever I make cream pies.  It is the best.  I make my own pie crust when I make cooked pies - or pies that have to be cooked with the crust.

Best strawberry pie I've ever eaten! It was so simple to put together and I used a nilla wafer pie crust. DELISH!!You can sub pre-made whipped topping if you don't want to make the whipped cream, but honestly why would you? It took 5 minutes to make the whipped cream and tasted 10 times better. YUM YUM!

Very good! I drained mashed strawberries as someone suggested as to help filling set better. Turned out fantastic. Great fresh strawberry taste. Used shortbread crust.

Love it!!  I will definitely make this again. I used a 9 1/2 inch pie plate so I'll probably double the filling next time. Instead of buying a graham cracker crust I made one.  Super good and super easy.

My husband loves when I make this pie and he is not a fan of strawberries. I make a crust out of Nilla Wafer cookies instead of graham cracker.

This pie turned out so delicious and creamy! I followed everyone's suggestions to drain some of the strawberry mash and in the middle I added a layer of slides strawberries so it looks like a layered cake. I also made extra cream and mashed strawberries to make a layer of tangy strawberry flavor on  top.

It's the easiest cream pie n the most delicious compared to pies that call for adding jello or gelatin. This recipe tastes the freshest. The only things I do different is add more reg n powdered sugar since it wasn't sweet enough for my taste n i prefer a regular pie crust.

Great recipe but I found the cream cheese taste not quite what I wanted.  I think if I double the mashed strawberries it will give more berry flavour.  Directions were spot on and easy to make.  Will make again and play to boost  it to 5 stars

I baked the pie using a pastry crust.  It baked nicely and held up nicely for the few days it lasted.  The filling was very good but could have been a bit sweeter.

Two great things about this recipe.  1. You can substitute other fruits/flavors for the strawberries.  2. It only calls for about a cup of strawberries. I can’t tell you how many times I have fruit I need to use because it’s getting a little old, yet don’t have enough to make a straight fruit pie.  This will be one of my go to  recipes.  Thank you!

I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, doubled the strawberries and 'healthy n fit' whipped cream. It was awesome! I also just made a version subbing fresh blueberries for the strawberries, as blueberries are now in season. Next I'm trying a red, white n blue version---using both blueberries n strawberries!

This pie is amazing! I've made it twice in two days, one for a church event, and one for home to be greedy with. Added extra strawberries to the batch, bout a cup and a half worth, rather than garnishing. Everyone loved it! The worst part of this recipe is waiting for it to chill. Barely made it long enough! Yum!

I didn't have heavy whipping cream. So instead I used homemade vanilla pudding  and whipped it into  the cream cheese and vanilla, adding sugar as needed. I used about 3Tbsp vanilla and added fresh peaches. Used the mini graham pie crusts and it was divine!

I substituted a container of Cool whip for the whipping cream steps.  Was done in 10 mins.  instead of adding the strawberries into the batter I put them on top.

Tasted really good however the pie did not set properly for me. No idea how I could have messed up something so easy but it was quite a mess. Threw it in the freezer to try and help matters but that did nothing. Still tasted good though.
