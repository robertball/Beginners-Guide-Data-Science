It was awesome with a few variations-I roasted the peppers in olive oil salt and pepper and then I added half a jalapeño and cayenne pepper for a spicier flavor and more salt and pepper than the recipe calls for. Otherwise it was great!

Followed directions on point. Little on the runny side, but that could have something to do with the size of the peppers as well. VERY VERY good flavor!!!!

Five star flavor!  I roasted the red pepper according to AR cooking school instructions!  (Thank you AR for easy instructions.)

Made this recipe with coconut oil instead of olive oil.  It was too thin for dipping when made, but firmed up overnight in the fridge.  Wonderful consistency for dipping the next day. 

Just the right amount of heat and a nice contrast with cold celery sticks.  

This recipe as written would make a great soup with just a few additions (i.e., cream and some smoked gouda, or sweetened coconut milk).

Going to make a bigger batch today and keep this in the fridge for snack attacks.

On HCG 2.0 diet, the fat calories are zeroed out by coconut oil.  This is an excellent snack.

Thanks for sharing this scrumptious recipe.

Excellent unique flavor.  Mine was too thin to use as a dip but I think I may have over puréed and I didn't drain the red peppers well enough.  Versatile, I will use this as a sauce on chicken, eggs etc.  I may even eat with a spoon :)
