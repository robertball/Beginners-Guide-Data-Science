I made it exactly as per the recipe. The batter was a little runny. 
Cake turned out very tasty but was a little crumbly and dry.
Eating it the next day, the cake is soft although still crumbly.
I baked it in a convection mode microwave oven. First at 170 deg C for 40 minutes and then at 160 deg C for 50 minutes.

Will try adding a cup of curd and only 1.5 cups of water next time.

A little oily but very nice.  I used an 8" square pan and a medium ring pan and it cooked in an hour--350 for the first 45 mins then 325 for the next 15 minutes.  In a square pan I would use parchment or brown paper to absorb the extra oil.  But still a great cake for someone who is allergic to dairy.

I didn't add the salt. I used 1 cup brandy and 2 cups water instead of all water. It turned out great. I had 3 loaves. I took it to coffee hour at church and it was a hit as well there. Everyone was raving about how good it was and asked for the recipe.

A hit!  Changed it up a bit after reading the reviews to keep it moist also used flute pan and only cooked 40 minutes to perfect.

I used this recipe because it was less work then the old family recipe I have used in the passed. I did save some effort, but the results where disappointing . The cake is dry, lacks integrity and taste is so so.
