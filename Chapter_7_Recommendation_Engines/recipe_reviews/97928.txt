My husband hates sour cream so I was a bit worried about this one, but he loved it.  It didn't have a strong sour cream taste and was delicious.

This was FANTASTIC!  I had my in-laws and parents for dinner so I doubled it.  It was creamy and so good.  I added bacon bits and sprinkled the top with chives too.  Very, very good!  I will make this forever!

I liked the which from scalloped potatoes which I usually make.  I did alter the recipe with less onion for a picky eater and I changed the velveta to 1 1/2 cups and half a cup of mozzerella.  I also added about 1/8 tsp garlic powder and right before I took it out I put additional cheese and some chopped cooked bacon on top.  Everyone loved them, but next time I will put in the 1/3 cup onion for sure.  Thanks!

Quick and easy. Watch the the cheese/butter in saucepan. Will burn easy even on low setting w/ gas stove. Must stir constantly. Lots of flavor. My 14 yr old son loved it.

I made as directed but added some leftover ham. The whole family loved it. The sour cream & onions made them so flavorful. Will make again!

Quick and easy to make, not a lot of fuss.  I had several baked potatoes left over from a previous meal and used them.  Very creamy and oh so good.

These potatoes are just okay in my opinion.  Very bland and desperately in need of something to make them special.  They're basically just cheesy potatoes.  If I make them again I'll definitely add garlic and cayenne and maybe even some green or red pepper and chives.  There's not enough onion in the recipe to even taste it.

These aren't too bad, but bland in my opinion.  The onion doesn't add enough for me and I can't really taste the salt and pepper.  I think it needs some minced fresh garlic and maybe a tad cayenne to spice it up a bit.  I'm not a huge fan of creamy dishes, so it does take a lot to please me with this type of stuff.  I think I'd like it better if I felt the flavor was worth it.  I wasn't sure how many potatoes to really use, as I have huge potatoes.  I went with 5 and really only used 3 1/2, so medium or small potatoes are probably more ideal.  We'll eat the remaining potatoes I boiled, though, so it's no big deal.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! The only thing I changed was to halve the recipe, but due to my husband's enthusiastic reaction, next time I'm making a full batch.

I was impressed with these -- I'm not normally a fan of Velveeta because it is processed, but I can see a use for it if it turns out creamy, cheesy cooking like this recipe! I added some bacon to this recipe to give a little bit of extra flavor to it. My boyfriend raved and said this tasted like his grandmother's macaroni and cheese -- definitely a high compliment!

I used pre-packaged home fries rather than potatoes and I added bacon and green olives as a topping.  It turned out great!  It was just a little cheesier than I've seen other versions of Pittsburgh potatoes

This recipe needs tweaking. First, what kind of potatoes? Cube w/peel or not?  I did russets and had WAY too much & peel was not tasty. It wouldn't fit in a 2 qt and then the cooking time had to be extended. Better re-heated the 2nd day.

To make it healthier I used yogurt instead of sour cream (whole milk yogurt), and still it was great.

I made this and as I was boiling the potatoes and re-read the recipe and the comments it did sound very bland - even with the sour cream - so I persevered and added cubed ham as others have suggested plus some peas and carrots - served with a side salad - hubby really liked it and I must admit I did too with the additions - I will make this again and with such a basic recipe it will accommodate many different ingredients - hubby even asked me to make it again - and I will - sorry I didn't give it 5 stars but it is almost that good as is but too bland for me - I hope you try this recipe - Cheers!

This was a very cheesy potato recipe, just what we were looking for! I did add some crushed ritz on top, then dotted with butter because we like a little added crunch, but did not make other changes. It's been a long while since I've used Velveeta...mom used to use it often for homemade mac and cheese, potatoes au gratin and cheese sauce.  Thanks Brad P. for a blast from the past comfort dish!

I brought this to a potluck, and it must have been good because there wasn't any left!   The taste was ok in my opinion, and I might use more onion next time.

This is a great dish, and my mother made it for years.  Try peeling and dicing potatoes before boiling--takes less time.  Remove from heat when potatoes still have some crunch. Add a jar of diced pimento for extra good flavor.  We always topped the dish with toasted corn flake crumbles in butter.  Yum!
