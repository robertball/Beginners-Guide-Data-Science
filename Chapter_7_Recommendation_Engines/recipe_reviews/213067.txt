What a lovely, delightful little cake!  I was excited to see this recipe, anxious to try it, and very pleased with how it turned out.  While plain yogurt is something I never buy, sour cream is something I always have on hand, so I subtstituted that for the yogurt. The batter reminds me of how you'd mix up pancakes, and is very light, airy and fluffy, just like the finished cake. I baked this in two (3-cup capacity) Bundt pans and it was just the perfect amount of batter. The vegetable oil makes it a very moist cake and the glaze soaks in to make it even more so.  I was afraid two tablespoons of lemon zest might be overkill but it wasn't at all.  I was also a little concerned that the limoncello might make this a little boozy tasting, especially in the glaze, but it wasn't an issue.  The combination of the zest, fresh lemon juice and limoncello makes this one refreshingly lemony cake.  Delicious on its own, and even better with berries or fresh whipped cream - followed by a little sip or two of ice cold limoncello!

This is sooooooo good!!  My husband loves lemon desserts and received some Limoncello for Christmas, so I made this for him.  It was so moist and he kept telling me how good it was. I made the recipe exactly as stated except I used a Bundt pan.  I baked it at the same temperature and time that the recipe calls for.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I have wanted to try this recipe for some time and I finally remembered today when I spotted the Limoncello in the back of the freezer, and I am so glad I did. Moist and very flavorful. Followed the recipe (except baked in mini bundt pans) and then drizzled lemon curd (Microwave Lemon Curd recipe from this site) over it, added a little whipped cream and then tossed a couple of Candied Lemon Peels (also from AR) on just for fun. Lemon, Lemon and more Lemon!  We loved it and it was fun making this dessert. I will make it again. Thanks for sharing!

I loved this cake!!!!  I did choose to substitute natural applesause for the 1/3 cup canola oil to cut down on fat.  It was great!!!!  Very guilt-free.  Very tasty and diet-friendly!!!!!

If you like lemon, you will love this! I used sour cream instead of yogurt (the 8oz box). Sooo good! Used a 9inch bundt pan, the cake was ready in exactly 35 minutes! Served it with homemade whipped cream and fresh strawberries

This tastes exactly how my brothers' grandmother used to make hers. Made some minor changes though. We included the pinch of salt, less zest (only had one lemon), a tad more lemon juice, a touch more powdered sugar and instead of Limoncello we used some leftover lemon-lime flavoured wine beverage (as per my mom's recommendation). Great to serve to guests with tea, or to complement an Italian or slightly heavy dinner as the cake is very airy and light. Easy, and I'm definitely going to make this again.

This was a delicious cake. The second time I made it, I did add 2 extra tablespoons of lemon juice because I wanted a more lemon-y flavor. Other than that I wouldnt change anything

This isn't the prettiest cake but it makes up for it in taste!  It was sooo moist and flavorful.  Made exactly according to recipe.  Did not need all the glaze.  Raised above the pan so used the extra glaze to sample the crumbs cut from the edge.  Will be serving with frest raspberries.  Resturant quality!

I happened to have a bottle of Limoncello in the fridge ....  Made according to recipe, using full-fat Greek yogurt.  Texture was nice -- not too heavy, not too light; good lemon tartness.  I put the glaze on too early (before cake had cooled much) but all this did was make for a nice crackly permimeter!  Thanks, TOH!

Good, simple cake, but it was somewhat dense.  The Limoncello is very faint, so I will use lemon juice instead and save the Limoncello for cocktails.  I'm glad I added extra lemon zest and extract.

DD requested Lemon CCs with Chocolate frosting for her birthday. These ARE "lemony" and rich and moist.  We especially liked the "Limoncello" drizzle because it hardens and becomes a crunchy little surprise under the frosting. Look closely at the photo; you can see a shiney little crust between the CC top and frosting. They were a huge HIT and   I will most certainly be making these again. The frosting is Wedding Cake Frosting from this site.

I substituted sour cream also for the yogurt and used a thin glaze in between the layers of Limoncello and lemon juice and powdered sugar.  The cake got better and better with each passing day.  The frosting was Whipped Mascarpone cheese frosting made with Lemon curd and cream.  Delicious..

I made this recipe as cupcakes with a few adjustments. I used sour cream instead of plain yogurt. I added a teaspoon of Madagascar Vanilla extract. The Caravella Limoncello seems to be more sweet than tart and sort of gets lost in the batter. So, I added extra zest and omitted the lemon extract.  I made a frosting using pureed fresh strawberries. I added Limoncello to the frosting.  I also filled the cupcakes with lemon filling and limoncello mixed in. Cupcakes were great with a nice lemon smell.

This recipe was amazing! I made it into muffins and cooked it five minutes at a time until it was lightly brown and the toothpick came out clean.  I used lime zest and juice since I was out of lemons. I also used blueberry yogurt instead of plain yougut to add more flavor(I had no plain yogurt). The resault was a light green muffin in stead of a yellow one, but it was delish! My family and I devoured them!

This was wonderful, light and airy.  I added lemon juice with the icing sugar to make a little more lemony. Made for guests and they all loved it.

I made this for my cousins' birthday party, and it was amazing! Everyone loved it. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a bunt pan. I baked it for about 1 hr 15 min. I let it cool for about 10 min before removing from the pan and pouring the glaze. When it cooled completely, I made it into a three-layer cake with lemon curd between the layers. I would definitely make this again!

I couldn't taste the lemon in this. I think I am a "lemonaholic" and need more than the average person. Everyone else said it tasted like lemon. I poured the 3 tablespoons of straight limoncello over the cake without any powdered sugar added to it. It made for a moist cake, but nothing I feel I would waste limoncello on.

A very moist cake; I think it would benefit from more lemon juice in the batter.  The Limoncello in the glaze was just too overpowering.

Very yummy!  Instead of making a cake - I spread the batter into my muffin sheet.  Made 12 awesomely moist limoncello muffins!  Baked for 23 minutes.

This was a tasty cake but didn't blow me away.  For the extra expense of buying the liquor I doubt I would fool w/this again.  Nothing special.

This cake was absolutely delicious!  A perfect ending to my Italian themed Valentines dinner.  I followed the recipe exactly, but did find the cake took about 40 minutes to bake.  I served with whipped cream and fresh diced strawberries.  Plenty of limoncello left in the bottle for a digestive, too!  Thank you for an excellent recipe.

This was very light and refreshing.  Unfortunately, I undercooked it so the middle of my cake was more pudding-like.  (The toothpick came out clean, I swear!)  The limoncello glaze was perfect and added a nice lemony flavor to the rich and moist cake.  Thanks for a great recipe, TheOtherHunny!

I had a hard time deciding how to rate this.  I did not like it at all but my guests did.  To me, the cake tasted too much like vegetable oil with not enough lemon flavor.  It was also pretty pale and unappetizing looking for serving to company.  It was easy to make, so I guess I will go middle of the road with 3 stars.  If I make again, I will try to add more lemon flavor.

Not as refreshing as I would have liked!!  I found this cake rather bland, even though I followed the instructions exactly.  I have been making a very similar cake for months (One of Nigella Lawson's recipes) and it is far more superior. I was just so disappointed with this cake, it was to be the perfect end to my Italian dinner last night.  Unfortunately that was not the case, thank goodness the vanilla ice cream I made off this site, to go with it was delicious!

We were quite happy with the flavor of this cake but I did find it to be a little "heavy".  I did make a few changes - used sour cream instead of yogurt and used the juice & zest of 2 lemons without measuring. Next time (and there will be a next time) I am going to add about 1 cup of blueberries to the cake.

Great recipe.  the only change I made was with the glaze.  I used 4 Tbsp of Limoncello.  I thought it was too thick to spread on a hot cake.  Turned out perfectly.

I made this as small bundt cake muffins and was disappointed in the outcome. As others have said, there wasn't enough lemony taste for me. I don't think I'll make this recipe again.

Followed the cake recipe exactly, turned out great; however, it does taste like a big pancake with a hint of lemon ... I love pancakes so it tastes good to me.

My crumb came out kind of rubbery and over all the cake was a little dry. I will try mixing it even less next time and will double the glaze so even more can seep into the cake. I also used Bacardi Limon instead of limoncello since I didn't have it.

I received a bottle of limoncello as a gift and needed something to do with it and this was a huge hit a Christmas this year.  Used a bundt pan instead of a cake pan for a nicer presentation and it didn't quite fill the whole pan but still cooked perfectly with the cooking times given.  Will definitely continue to use the bottle of limoncello to make more cakes!

Fantastic!  I did not use as much zest, but it was great anyway.  My whole Italian family loved it!  Use real Limoncello.

I made one minor change to this, and I think it was worth it. After letting the cake cool some, I removed it from the pan and then poked holes in the top and poured the glaze over. It ran decoratively down the sides and was quite pretty.
Otherwise I made it exactly as directed, and it is perfect as is.

I made this for my husband's birthday. He's a lemon lover and he loved this cake. I made it as directed. We served it with strawberries the next day and it was even better if that's possible. Next time I may add more of the delicious glaze.

It had a great taste but more of a bread consistency than cake. Will try to tweak a bit to see how can I have a better result. Bottom line, I'll make this again...

Followed recipe exactly as written, and loved the results! A nice dense, not too sweet, flavorful cake that rivals (& my daughter says, surpasses) the Limoncello cake from our favorite Italian restaurant. I used low fat Greek yogurt and a large lemon for zest and juice and baked it in a 9" single layer cake pan. The mixture was more like quick bread than cake batter consistency, but the final product was fab! Served with some whipped cream and fresh raspberries - but it would have been just as good without the additions. I will be making this again!

Followed the recipe with one exception...used 4 tablespoons of lemon juice (glad I did). The cake was very good. It is a "heavy" cake. Next time I will try the "pancake" method of stirring...pour the liquid into the dry ingredients (with well in center) and combine slowly. This may make for a lighter cake.

I loved this cake! It was perfect for a Sunday Brunch Event in Malibu. I substituted Tessora Limoncello and it had just the right amount of lemon zest to it. I recommend Tessora for Gluten-Free lovers like myself! www.tessora-liqueur.com

Personally, I like this cake a lot.  It was very moist and not too sweet.  My husband said it was bland.  This was before I put on the glaze, but we did not get to taste that, since I made only one test cupcake.  I used a light good quality olive oil instead of the canola oil.  And I found with the given amount of powdered sugar, I needed a bit more limoncello to create the glaze.  Other than that, this is an excellent refreshing cake for those without a huge sweet tooth.

Nice cake with subtle lemon flavor.  I used my homemade cream of limoncello, which may be slightly more mellow than regular limoncello. I brought this to a friend's house for dinner, and served it with fresh strawberries, blueberries and cool whip.  Everyone enjoyed it!  My only wish was that it was a little more moist.  Maybe a bit of buttermilk next time.

DO NOT use an 8 inch cake pan. It will over flow. Bundt pan is a better choice. Otherwise easy recipe and good tasting.

I agree with a few others in that the lemoncello didn’t add to flavor as much as I expected. Also, I forgot to put parchment paper on the bottom of the pan.

This was an enjoyable light and refreshing cake that I made for my son's 21st Birthday . Not too sweet but with a subtle lemon flavor. The Limoncello was perfect to use in the batter and for the glaze. I will definitely make this again.

Made the recipe as written and I will definitely make it again.  The cake was moist and very tasty.

I didn't care for this cake.  I was expecting something light and refreshing, but this cake was dense and dry.   Flavor was just OK and would have preferred a stronger lemon taste.  Would not make again.

I made this for a dinner party for  lemon lovers and they really enjoyed it.  Made it as the recipe stated with one exception.  There is way too much batter for an 8 inch round pan.  I had to use a 9 inch pad and the cake turned out perfect.

I thought it was good; husband didn't care for it, but he's not crazy about lemon, either. Will probably make again, especially for our family's monthly birthday dinners. 
I didn't alter anything.

I followed the recipe, and found the cake a little dry.  But made the microwave lemon curd, and added fresh berried.  The dessert was a hit.

This cake was the perfect ending to a wonderful Italian Christmas dinner. I made the recipe exactly with the exception that I increased everything by half to make this the perfect size to bake in a bundt pan. I baked it for the same time specified and it came out perfectly.  I should have increased the glaze amount to accommodate the larger cake, but it was still absolutely delicious! It was the perfect balance of sweet/tart and I was careful to follow the direction of not over-mixing to ensure that it wouldn't become too dense. It came out fine but I toy with the idea of making it again but separating the eggs and whipping the whites to fold in at the end to see if it will lighten even further. A definite keeper!

Everyone loved it! Made lemon curd to put on top and served it with whipped cream. Also, I made it gluten free. Delicious and refreshing. Will make again!

My family loved this! I added a couple of extra tablespoons of lemon juice, based on other comments. Served with fresh raspberries. Very moist and delicious.

Very light and fluffy.  I was hoping for a more dense pound cake style dessert.  I might replace half of the flour with almond meal next time.

The cake itself turned out wonderful and moist. I would add a full tablespoon more of lemon zest. Skip the glaze...it's awful. It taste's just like powdered sugar mixed with alcohol.  I Will try a Lemon curd topping the next time instead.

I just made this recipe.The cake is delicious. I made my own limoncello,so very strong. I only had 1/2 the yogurt (used greek) so I substituted some creme fraiche (I had made with fresh cream and 1 tablespoon buttermilk, and set out over night) maybe I fubbed and added a little more of the creme fraiche. Was super moist and not overly sweet. Probably great as it sits. Husband says just for adults.Thanks for the recipe. (used David Rocco's recipe for limoncello, easy) Made it in a 9 inch round cheese cake pan.oops, forgot the oil, still super soft and moist.

I followed this recipe to the letter and it was a flop. The cake was too dense and and had a gummy texture.I would never bake this cake again.I bake often and have never made a cake this bad.

This was a very good cake, very light and fluffy, and the perfect end to a meal! My whole family enjoyed it! I baked it in a bundt pan and it turned out BEAUTIFUL.   The only comment I have is that it seemed that the limoncello liquer all settled toward the bottom of the cake after cooking, so the bottom half seemed much more "alcohol-y" (according to my sister). And I wish it had been a little bit more tart. Next time I'll add a little bit more lemon juice/zest. But not too much!
