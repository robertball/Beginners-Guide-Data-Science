this turned out great.  the only thing i did different is to use a colored bendy straw instead of the stick candy for the center body.

Very Easy way to dress up a simple cake. You can take this in any direction you want and was a lot of fun to make.

I made this for my daughter's 1st birthday party.  Her theme was butterflies and it looked great!  Carve out some time to make and decorate it.  It took me a while to decorate it.  Put your first layer of frosting on and then chill the cake for 15-20 min.  This stabilizes the first layer so you don't get any crumbs in your second layer of frosting (I made it with chocolate cake instead of vanilla).
