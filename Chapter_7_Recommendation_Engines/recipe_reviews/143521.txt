I was hoping for a fresh ice cream with good taste & texture. Something light and non-descript in flavor. This one is not a keeper.

Pros: Easy enough to make - no cooking. Common ingredients - no special trips to the store to make it. Has a great consistency and texture.

Cons: Has a weird after taste, almost a bite to it. Doesn't taste like "cheese cake" at least none I've ever had.

This ice cream is wonderful! The suggestion to mix it in the blender was great because it made the batter so fluffy. I added a swirl of strawberry glaze while it was still soft and in the storage container. It even got rave reviews from a picky eater in the family. Thank you, Robert! This is keeper =)

This was excellent.  I swirled in strawberry preserves and graham cracker crust pieces.

Made a few changes: used 2 cups milk and 2 cups whipping cream. Used butterscotch liqueur instead of triple sec. Turned out great. Smooth and tastes just like cheesecake. Can't wait to make again.

This is my first time making ice cream after purchasing the Cuisinart ice cream maker recommended by America’s Test Kitchen.  As a personal preference, I omitted the Triple Sec and increased the vanilla extract which worked out great for us.  I topped it with strawberries and it did remind us somewhat of cheesecake.  My daughter was impressed that I could make such terrific ice cream.   What’s really nice about this recipe, besides being yummy, is the ingredients are readily available in your pantry.

Really good and really easy. Changes I made were cutting the recipe in half, used whipping cream and milk instead of just milk and left out the triple sec. I'm assuming the triple sec was to help prevent the ice cream from freezing into a solid block (alcohol doesn't freeze). But that issue was resolved by upping the fat content with the cream. Definitely making this again, and not cutting the recipe in half this time.

Absolutely think this is fantastic! One little thing though is that I did leave the triple sec out (might be more than a little thing?). I wanted vanilla flavored cream cheese. It's like i'm eating cheesecake in a cone! Thanks SOOO much for sharing the recipe. I've made this one time before today and now that the heat is back...I've been asked to make it again....Will do! Thanks!

my family thanks you for this recipe! I used cashew milk instead of 1% milk because it's what I had handy, I didn't use quite a whole1/3 cup of triple sec because my teenage daughter wanted me to omit it all together. I love the idea f mixing it all in the blender and might do that for other ice cream recipes as well! it froze to a wonderful creamy soft serve consistency and I couldn't decide what cheesecake topping to use so we all had different - cherries, strawberry, carmel, and peanutbutter.

For mature audiences only ice cream. We made it with Cointreau, as opposed to tripple sec. VERY interesting flavor and as others have noted, Cheescake Ice creams do leave you with an after taste, but the alcohol seem to mitigate that affect. Also, we make all our ice cream with fresh Alpine Goat Milk, as was the cheese. 

We also gave a pint to our neighbor, which made them much more friendly.

very delish and easy to make. I used 3cups 2%milk and 1cup heavy cream (had to get rid of from another ice cream recipe) I also used full fat cream cheese, as this is all I had. Didn't have triple sec so I just omitted it and upped the vanilla. The only con is I didn't have a blender big enough for everything, but did it in 2 batches. maybe next time half the recipe. Also folded graham crackers at the end and tasted just like cheesecake.

Top notch recipe.  Loved the texture.  Will try again but substitute Baileys for triple sec.
