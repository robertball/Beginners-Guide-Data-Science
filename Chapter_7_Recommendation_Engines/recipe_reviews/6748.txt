Very tasty, not too sweet.  I think it could be baked maybe 10 minutes longer, though.  The inside was a little mushy.  I didn't have coconut extract so I substituted vanilla extract.  You can make your own self rising flour by adding 1.5 tsp of baking powder per cup of flour and 1 tsp of salt.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe turned out very well... but the taste was just awful. The vanilla sugar gave it a very bitter taste. I had to throw out the whole loaf.

I am a cocoNUT so I had high hopes for this bread. Unfortunately, this was lacking flavor to me. In addition, it was crumbly as another reviewer stated. I prefer a nice dense quick bread with loads of flavor. Thanks for sharing. BTW it needs to bake about 10 more minutes for the center to get done.

I was surprised at how quickly this bread disappeared after I made it.  My 4 kids thought this was a great alternative to the usual breakfast food.  I will definitely make this again--in larger batches!

The taste was coconut heaven, but there was one problem - although the inside was "just baked" super moist, the outside was almost overbaked and kind of dry.  Hmmm, I'll still make it again!

So delicious! My daughter and I ate it all for breakfast. I only had one egg so I cut all ingredients in half. Used a loaf pan. Took 35 minutes. Was perfect! Added shredded coconut, a half tsp of coconut extract and a pinch of salt to the frosting. Did not use vanilla sugar, just regular sugar.

This had a great texture.  I used vanilla instead of coconut extract and Greek yogurt instead of sour cream.

In my opinion, this recipe makes alot of batter/dough!  It certainly rises well above the rim and looks amazing as it bakes in the oven.  I decided at 45 minutes in to cover it with aluminum foil which worked well cause I ended up having to bake it just over an hour (the center certainly took longer to cook.)   My husband and I like the taste very much but it's messy to cut!  I will make this recipe again but I'll probably try it as more manageable muffins instead.

The flavor was good, but it turned out extremely dry and crumbly. Probably wouldn't make this one again.
