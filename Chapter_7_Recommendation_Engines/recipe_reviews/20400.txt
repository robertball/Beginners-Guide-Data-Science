Very good!  I used Splenda instead of sugar and fat-free milk to make it a low-calorie drink.  It was really good!

Wonderful!  My kids and I loved it!  I used Pineapple-Orange Banana frozen conentrate because that's what I had on hand.  Will make this again, and will probably try adding fruit like some suggested.

Good, but not quite sweet enough for me.  Maybe next time I'll add a few scoops of vanilla ice cream.

This is practically the exact same recipe as the Orange Smoothie on this site. We used 10 ice cubes and next time will leave out the vanilla. Very tasty! Thanks!

This was a really good and refreshing drink. My uncle absolutely loved Orange Julius's (I think that's how it's spelled) when he was younger and was tickled when I made this for him.  My blender doesn't crush ice very well so I was left with big chunks, but that didn't seem to bother anyone.  I left out the vanilla by mistake and still had good results.  Would be great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream mixed in.  Many thanks Brooke.

Great twist on regular OJ! To make it taste more like the creamsicle popsicle, add a bit more vanilla. Really good!

I have been making this for years,only my recipe calls for 1/2 cup sugar and 1-2 tsp. vanilla( a little sweeter). It is called Orange a la Julius. It is just like what you get in shops but a fraction of the price. If you like those you really must try this, it is really good. You can also use grape juice, but I have not tried it with that yet because we enjoy this so much. Thanks Brooke for getting this printed so others can enjoy. :o)

Excellent, fast and a lot better and cheaper than going to Orange Julius.  Easy to add a little zing to by adding a banana, blackberries, strawberries, etc.

I thought this was really good.. some of the other reviewers suggested ice cream... I used non-dairy coffee creamer. It added a rich creamy flavor. Very refreshing...

Only thing I had to do different was use my Pineapple-Orange-Bannana Juice Concentrate I was out of regular OJ, it was great!

This is just like the Orange Julius' I had when I was a kid. They are wonderful, especially in warm weather. I make this for my children now and also add a banana which gives it added flavor.  It is always a hit.

Glorious is right!  This is a great "after" hangover drink, when you cant get enough OJ and/or milk - here you have it, a tasteful bit of each!  Delicious, thanks Brook!

A nice refreshing change for breakfast on the run, but does not taste anything like an orange julius.  For more sweetness do as suggested by other reviewers and add some vanilla ice cream. Myself...I thought it would be perfect with some french vanilla yogurt thrown in. Overall, a pretty decent base to start with.

It was great - taste just like at the mall.  Next time I think I will leave out the water and use LOTS of ice so it will be thicker.

I definately LOVED this recipe!  I have made it several times.  Each time it has a consistantly refreshing taste and I enjoy it each time I make it.  I will definately use this recipe again.  Although it is GREAT as it is, i recommend putting extra vanilla in it (1 tsp) or add a scoop of vanilla Ice cream!!  Otherwise it was fabulous!

Wonderful drink. Almost as good as Orange Julius..
the missing ingredient....a scoop of vanilla ice
cream, or maybe a couple of spoonfuls of vanilla
malt (powder). My family loved it with malt.
Brook's recipe is yummy but it needs the extra
"creamy" texture. Try it our way..it's great too.

I've been picking up a lot of recipes here and trying a lot of new things.  This drink is very good - my mother-in-law tasted it and loved it - which is a compliment since she is a shake/smoothy making nut.  The vanilla is what gives this drink it's unique wonderfulness.

I always add a little honey to any smoothie and I did that here and it helped kick up the sweetness just a bit.  My 5 year old loved it!

I didn't really care for this drink.  I thought it needed to be more creamy so I added some cool whip... still missing something.  I won't try it again... sorry!

Easy to make with ingredients already on hand, and nutritious made with skim milk (I add a banana, too). My daughter loves it. I'm going to try it with other flavors of juice. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was delicious! Tasted just like the real thing. Not exactly healthy, but the taste more than compensated for it. This Orange 'Glorious' tasted just like the real thing. I'm going to make it for friends at an upcoming party!

Having made this smoothie so many times over the last couple years, I've found our favorite version: fill the blender about a quarter full of crushed ice, add a 1/2 c OJ (omit water), the OJ conentrate, 1/4 c sugar (or Splenda) a couple scoops of fat-free frozen yogurt, 1 tsp vanilla and 3 T malted milk powder (I'm convinced this is the ingredient needed to make this taste like a real Orange Julius!)  I make these every summer (and whenever the craving arises), and these are always sooooo good!

This is fabulous!!!  I made a few changes though...I omitted the water and added 1 sliced banana and 7.5 oz. of frozen sliced strawberries.  It was wonderful and my husband said it was the best and that I was going to have to make it again....Thank you for sharing

As written these are okay but it has a lot of potential.  It had a weird aftertaste as someone else mentioned...perhaps its the vanilla?  Will play around with this one!

This drink is really good and refreshing change of pace from yogurt smoothies.  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly.  The only thing I would suggest is to buy the frozen orange juice concentrate that you really like and could drink as plain oj.  I bought the store brand and it threw off the taste of the drink.

Super easy and good. I used orange juice from a bottle instead of the concentrate and water, used non-fat milk, and Splenda, and it turned out great. I didn't even measure out all the ingredients...still turned out great.

Delicious! I tweaked the recipe a bit. I added a 6oz vanilla yogurt, and used vanilla sugar instead of regular white sugar. I didn't use the one cup of ice water, & it turned out very frothy.

This recipe is just as good if not better than the famous drink.  Wouldn't change a thing.

This is good. It's best with half the ice, though. Tastes just like the real thing, but better because it's home made. I have made it with liquid honey as well, which you need less of. Don't skip the vanilla - it's essential to the authentic flavor; pure is best. My kid's love, love, love this!

This is a great recipe!  Sometimes I substitute yogurt for the milk,which  also good.  Today I took a fresh peach and cut it into chunks and froze it for several hours.  I then added the frozen chunks along with the ice cubes.  Extra tasty!  :-)

An excellent smoothie. Looking to replace the customized julius version with eggs. This works well but I tweaked this too. Try leaving out the water.

This is now my go to dessert! There are so few ingredients and they are so common that I ALWAYS have them on hand and my son gets SO EXCITED when I make it which is awesome because it's more healthy than any other desserts we have lying around the house!! Shoot, one morning we had them for breakfast!

Good, but not like what they sell at the Orange Julep here in Montreal. I was hoping this would be a creamy orange drink like they serve there; this is more like a frothy, milky orange drink. As is, the orange juice is a little strong in this beverage.

Made this for my kids with breakfast this morning.  All but one (the one who doesn't like citrus) liked it.  It was refreshing and a nice change from the usual juice.

This is very good as is, but it can be made even more like the mall version by adding a generous tablespoon of malt powder and 1/4 C. sugar. The original recipe also used a raw egg to provide the froth on top.

YUMMY!!  Every bit as good as the mall version I remember as a kid.  My two boys slurped this down very happily.  We'll keep this in our treat/smoothie rotation for a long time!  I think it could handle vanilla up to about a 1/2-1 tsp, I'll try that increase next time.  thanks!

Not sweet enough for me and it was lacking something.  It did not taste like Orange Julius to me.  If you're looking for that go to Topsecretrecipes.com and you will find it for free.  I had to add a couple more tbs. of sugar and a banana to make suit my taste and my kids too.

I had just received a new "Smoothie Elite" machine for my birthday. This was the first recipe I tried, and it's dreamy! I did do a little adjusting, as it wasn't sweet enough for me. So I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and a 1/4 cup of sugar. I also used baker's sugar, which is more fine than regular sugar (it blended perfectly). This does taste just like an Orange Julius. Does anyone remember that old Saturday Night Live sketch where Sylvester Stallone is obsessed with Orange Julius? YUM, Mr. Stallone! I will try this recipe with other kinds of fruit concentrates. I bet this would be a great frozen alcoholic drink...now I wonder what kind of liquer would work with this??? Hmmmm....

Very good recipe. It taste similar to the orange smoothie recipe on here and like the Orange Julius drinks at the malls. I made it as is but used low fat milk and a packet of Truvia to replace the sugar. I even added 4 extra ice cubes, because I decided to just do the full ice cube tray. I may even try it sometime with frozen oranges. TY

Delectable! I was afraid skim milk might be too thin for this drink, but it tasted great - and was definitely sweet enough with the amount of sugar listed. Perfect for summertime :)

love this recipe - the only thing different I do is to double the ice cubes and whir it in the blender for a minute or two until all the ice is in tiny little pieces

Mmmmm so good!  This reminds me of the "orange julius" drinks we used to get at the mall when I was a kid back in the '70s.  Used Splenda instead of sugar as others suggested.  Wonderful.

Very good.  I used a little more than a cup of crushed ice from my fridge, and it blended up very easily.

i have made this several times and it is yummy! i like my smoothies a little on the thick side so i omit the ice water, but other than that, i follow it as is. works great as a breakfast smoothie, just add a banana. you may want to cut down the sugar a bit, though, or you won't be able to finish it. all in all, it's a good recipe. worth a try!

This was very similar to the ones you get at the mall, except the mall ones contain a more ice; crunchier. Four stars instead of five because I have the real recipe and it is a little better.

Besides being a little bit bitter thanks to the concentrate it was fantastic.  I substituted the sugar for Splenda to lower the calories.

Tasted just like an orange julius! I used freshly squeezed orange juice instead of the frozen concentrate and left that in the fridge till it was cold. I also didn't add the ice water. Added banana too it as well! Yum!

This is very good.  I made it as the recipe called for and it was a little more liquidy than I liked.  Next time I'll reduce the liquid and increase the ice cubes.  Overall a very good flavor.

Yummy! I have made this many times now, and love it. I have found that when using skim milk, I like it best with all milk for the liquid (no water). I generally cut everything in half (except vanilla)and it worked fine. I tried other review suggestions to use powdered sugar, raw sugar and found that while it was still good, it tasted less like the mall version I remember from the 80's. I think I am now addicted!

The first time I made this I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was excellent. The second time I added about 2 tablespoons of powdered sugar and, in my opinion, it was perfection.

I love anything orange and this was pretty refreshing on a hot day, and better for you than say a milk shake.  I made as is, except that I always use 1% milk (reducing it to a nearly fat free recipe).  I have to add, though, that there are similar recipes on here and some are just as good.

My husband LOVED it, he drank the whole thing by himself. I just cut 12 oz frozen thing of orange juice in half and saved the rest for next time. I made it exactly as written and he said it tasted just like the drink you get from the mall. Now we can make it at home for less than half the price of the one at the mall and not spend the gas to drive to the mall! Thanks, will definately make again.

I am a frothy beverage critic because I make smoothies every morning.  I enjoyed this recipe.  I would make it with less ice water and more ice next time though.  I prefer more of a smoothie consistency.  Will use again. Thanks!

It's probably just a matter of personal taste, but I really didn't like this at all. I made it one night as a treat for a bunch of friends, and the flavor was so far off that I ended up adding tons of vanilla ice cream to balance out the flavor. With the addition of the ice cream it tasted ok, but nothing spectacular. I won't be making this again.

We have made this one before. There is another recipe on this site that is similar. Reminds me of the Orange Julius that we used to get in the mall. Thanks for the memories!

Very Good!  After experimenting, I now use 1/2 cup sugar or Splenda, and 1 teaspoon vanilla. I was looking for a recipe that tasted like Orange Julius.  This is it! Grandkids enjoy it.

This was pretty good.  It was a bit sour though.  Next time, I might double the sugar to sweeten it up a tad.  I will be making this one again.

Awesome!  I used vanilla soy milk 'cause my fam is lactose intolerant.  I added too much vanilla and ended up adding some orange extract to make it taste like a creamsicle.  Great!!

It was good but a little too sweet and acidy. Next time I will add some other fruit to calm it down a little and less orange juice concentrate.

This "smoothie" type drink was very good.  We added a little squeeze of honey to give it a sweet kick, but, followed the recipe and it came out great.  Good for an in-between snack or as a meal.  It does fill you up.

Love this!  I am rating the original recipe here!  However, I like to tweak things and play with recipes!  I use all milk and no water and sometimes even replace some of the milk with whipping cream.  My kids absolutely love this recipe!!!  Such a treat in the morning!

My wife loved it, I made it with a 12 oz can of concentrate and everything else the same, it cut the sweetness good that way... Then I wondered how good it would be with rum in it, very good adult beverage too!

Very good!  Much better than the sickeningly sweet "Orange Julius" we got a while back.  Used unsweetened almond milk and stevia.

This tastes just like an orange cream popsicle! It was very refreshing and creamy. A few changes were made. Instead of frozen orange juice concentrate, I used fresh squeezed orange juice, and then froze them as ice cubes. I did the same method for the milk. I left out the water all together. I drank half of the mixture, and then did something different. I added some frozen chopped Apricots to it and blended everything together. Very yummy!

This gets a five with the alterations I made. This is a great base recipe and have the basic ingredients I was looking for. I had a 12oz can of O.J. so I more or less doubled it. I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk, filled the empty O.J. can with ice water instead of two cups. Still only used 1/8 C of sugar. Used a whole tsp of vanilla, the real stuff not imitation and 24 Ice cubes. This was so very good. I think the 1/2 & 1/2 and more vanilla really made it. The blender would not hold it all so I had to take about 1 1/2 cups out before adding the 24 ice cubes and then mix it back in after. Thanks for the recipe.

Flavorful. My kids thought it was great but both my husband and I though it would be better using orange sherbert so I will try that next time.

I have had this recipe for 25 years except mine calls for 1/2 to 3/4 c. sugar because the concentrated orange juice is bitter.  It is a great way to get the kids to have their vit. C and calcium.  A good way to lower the calories is to use splenda, low fat milk, and low fat juice.

I thought that this recipe was ok. 
 To me, it was not as sweet as I hoped but that may have been that result of my changes.
 First of all i had to freashly squeze the oranges because i did not have any orange juice.
 I also did not have any plain white surger so i used Splenda instead.
 I think at some point i will try to do this recipe again and do it your way!

Better than the Julius!  The last couple I got from there tasted like cardboard.  Definitely a guilt-free drink that you could even serve with breakfast.  It would be fun to try with other juice flavors i.e. strawberry.

Pretty good, the only thing is that it can be too runny. Try vanilla ice cream instead of milk.

Very good but we found it a bit too runny. Added 20 ice cubes and used a 1/t tsp vanilla. Also, my family liked it a bit sweeter so we used 1/4 cup plus 2T of sugar. Not so healthy but a definite treat!

Really need a straw to enjoy this drink. I halved the recipe and served it to my 6yo DS, who helped make it. He took one sip and wouldn't finish it. DH said it need more ice cubes. Not sure if I would make again but to me, it tasted like the stuff served at the mall.

This is the exact recipe that we used when we were growing up. It's the recipe for the Orange Julius store that was so popular in California.  Our favorite combination was to use grape juice concentrate instead, it has a nice tart and sweet taste.

I used this recipe for an exam in foods, and now I try to use it every opprotunity!

This recipe is by far the best drink I had ever had.

Excellent drink!  My whole family loves it.  And they are picky.  Sometimes I add a frozen banana, and have made it with frozen raspberries.  This is definitely one our favorites.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe

I liked this smoothie don’t get me wrong, but the only thing about it that I didn’t like is that it had a very yogurty taste that didn’t go well with the orange flavor.

So good and creamy. Easy to make also which is nice. Nice summer treat, especially when it’s hot outside. Tastes like a melted orange creamsicle snow cone!

This turned out great. My brother was asking for and he doesn't like smoothies very much. I ended up adding pineapple since I didn't want to sugar to sweeten it. Will do again.

Palatable with a great texture, but lacks something. The taste here is that distant kind of flavor where it's pleasant, but there's clearly a key ingredient missing that brings it all together. I tried adding more sugar and vanilla, but it still wasn't all the way there. To be fair, I did use orange juice that semi-froze, rather than packaged frozen orange juice concentrate.

As it stands, it's a nice drink -- I could see this being very refreshing after a hot summer day, especially when what you need more than flavor is just a smooth, chilly beverage. I'd rate it on the positive side of neutral. There is potential here, so I look forward to discovering what will make this treat fulfill its destiny as a true classic.

This drink is a traditional Dominican drink called morí soñando . (Die Dreaming ) . This is a great drink for any time of the day. You can also replace the milk with carnation milk , for a more decadent taste and add lemon for tangy taste,

This is really tasty! I think I sort of ruined it by using store brand OJ the first time so I made another batch with less OJ and added a bit of banana for sweetness and thickening and it was much better. Next time I will spring for Minute Maid!

Was not as creamy as an orange Julias but it was still tasty. The orange flavor was refreshing and it wasn't too sweet. So much cheaper than going to the mall and getting the real deal.

This drink was pretty good, however too overpowering with orange concentrate. I may cut to half the amount next time and see. I will be making many more times after I adjust it some.

So good! Super easy to make! I usually have these ingredients on hand so I can make them anytime the urge hits. It really tastes so good! I prefer these to the costly mall drinks! Great anytime of the year! Thank you for sharing!!

We didn't like this at all.  :(  It definitely needed something.  You can add cool whip to it to make it more like an orange dreamsicle, but it still needs SOMETHING.

Sooo Yummie!  It reminds me of shopping with my Nana when I was younger.  We would stop at the food court and order these.  I didn't have any ice in my freezer, but it was still good.  Great quick breakfast!  Thanks!
*Update*  I have since tried it with the ice cubes.  Yum!

Delicious!!! Since I didn't have any oj concentrate in my kitchen I added fresh oj. It was a hit! We also didn't have bananas so i added raspberry extract to the blend and added fresh raspberries on top at the end. It was great I'll save this one.

This is one of my favorite drinks I have ever made!  It is good for the family and for large occasions.  However, there is one simple draw back after 5-10 minutes the juice concentrates to the bottom and the cream goes to the top.  Eveb though this is the case, with a quick shake or stir it is back to normal.  This is one of the best drinks ever!

This is quite tasty!  Much like the Orange Julius I used to purchase while shopping in the mall.  When I make again, I may add a banana to it just to change it up a bit, but it was great for a breakfast smoothie!
