Way too much with using 2 cups bread crumbs.  The bread crumbs were over bearing.  Would have been better to reduce to 1 cup or use ritz crackers.

I added finely chopped onion and celery saut√©ed in a little butter. Instead of bread crumbs I topped it with crushed ritz crackers and dotted with butter. It was a huge hit!!

I made it.. I did some tweaking to the recipe.. I added 1/2 cup rice, 1/4 onion chopped to minced, 1/4 celery chopped, no salt, pepper/onion/garlic powder to taste.. sprinkle little cheese on top.. cooked for 25 minutes then sprinkled bread crumbs mixed on it then cook the rest.. side for anything..
