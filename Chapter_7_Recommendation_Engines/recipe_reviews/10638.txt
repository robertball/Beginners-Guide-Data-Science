This is perhaps the most fantastic cookie I have ever made in my life.

Here are my tips:

1) I used 1/2 the amount of dried cranberries (actually used orange crasins)

2) I used 1 tsp. of orange zest and added it right into the batter (next time I am upping this to 1 tablespoon)

3) I used slivered almonds instead of the pistachio nuts.  The slivered almonds worked very well because they did not "chunk up" the batter.

4)  When I took the loaves out of the oven, I immediately covered them with two dishtowels so that the loaves would cool more slowly.  It's the sudden change in temperature that makes things out of the oven "crack" on top, and the dishtowels minimized this.  

5)  I transferred one loaf at a time to my wooden cutting board and cut diagonal slices with a large bread knife.  I did now saw.  I simply leaned into it with my body weight, and all my slices came out pretty cleanly.  I also first cut off just a tad bit from either in at first before cutting the slices off.

6)  I melted white chocolate in the microwave and dipped on end in, then sprinkled with red and green colored sugars.  
By doing all of this, (oh, plus you MUST wet your fingertips while working with the dough before it goes in the oven), I got 24 clean slices.  These freeze beautifully as well.  I LOVE this recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe.  Italian friends have told me this taste "just the way biscotti is supposed to taste."  I reduced pistachios by 1/2 cup and increased the cranberries by 1/2 cup.  I also add 1/2 tsp. real orange extract.  Otherwise, the recipe is perfect.  If you are not getting 3 dozen, you may be making the logs too wide.  Make them 2 inches wide and then flatten them slighty.  It is a smaller biscotti than those sold in jars at coffee shops.  DON'T use butter or margarine.  Find a light good quality olive oil.  Butter doesn't belong in biscotti--it won't age well and will become rancid instead of allowing the flavor to develop.

By gads! This is the very =best= biscotti recipe! Usually I can't stand those nasty little bricks, but these are delicious! Try these even if you usually don't like biscotti... m-m-m-m yummy. HINT: Use a regular knife to cut these... the serrated blade makes a big mess.

Yum!  I used orange-flavored Craisins, used 1c cran & 1c pistachio, and added about 1/4 tsp orange extract.  Based on a review that said these spread out a lot, I made two perfectly round logs (the hand-wetting tip worked perfectly).  After 45 minutes of baking, it still wasn't very brown (but it was done), it didn't spread THAT much, and it was very difficult to cut.  I used a good serrated knife, but I still had to cut them wider just to get a slice that didn't break apart (though some still did).  Since they tasted so good, I thought I'd try a second batch.  My adjustments:  I very coarsely chopped the cranberries and pistachios; I reduced the cran/pistachio amounts to 3/4 cup each (though in hindsight, the chopping might have been enough to help simplify cutting - I might use the full 1 cup next time); I flattened the logs a bit; and I brushed an egg wash on the logs (1 egg + 1Tb water).  After 40 minutes of baking, the cookies had a great brown color, and had spread perfectly.  I let them cool 10 minutes on the cookie sheet, then carefully transferred them to my cutting board, where I let them cool another 10 minutes or so.  What a difference - it was so much faster and easier to cut them.. they came out looking perfect.  I drizzled with white chocolate to finish.

Excellent recipe that won me a baking contest! Soft enough that they can be eaten without being dipped in a drink. Make sure to let the logs cool before slicing them, otherwise they will crumble and fall apart. Highly recommended!!!!

These are fantastic!  I've made several bathces of these in the past few months.  Yes, the nuts can be difficult to cut through- I coarsley chop mine.  I've also coated one side in white chocolate then drizzled it with milk chocolate- beautiful presentation & tastes great!  DO use parchment paper, as the recipe calls for, or they will stick.  Wetting your hands does make shaping the sticky dough very easy.  These also freeze beautifully.  5 stars!!

these are delicious-I made them with olive oil and the 2nd  time I use margerine. 
I liked them better with margerine -  I added more cranberries and dipped in white choc-yummy! I will make these again.

I made these biscotti for the holidays because they are apparently a popular holiday item.  I think the biscotti turned out just okay.  I am 100% Italian-American and an exceptional Italian cook.  I grew up cooking and baking with my beloved mom and I've made MANY biscotti in my lifetime.  After reviewing similar recipes, I made some simple changes to this recipe because I think doing so makes the biscotti a bit more authentic & tasty.  For starters, I increased my oven temp to 325F degrees; you might also do 350F degrees, a standard temp for biscotti.  I increased the flour to 2-2 1/4 cups, added 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1 tsp orange extract & 1/4 tsp of cinnamon. I changed the olive oil to 1/3 c vegetable oil 'cause I think olive oil is way too heavy for biscotti.  I also added even cups of dried cranberries and pistachios.  I ALWAYS bake biscotti on parchment paper!  As the biscotti cooled, I melted 8 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate with 1 tsp of shortening and when melted, dipped the biscotti into the mixture.  I think without a chocolate glaze, the biscotti are way too bland...I think chocolate makes the biscuits a LOT more interesting.  Finally, if you are into baking biscotti like I am, invest in a simple electric knife for cutting the logs...it really is the only way to go!  Also, forget all the flipping and turning. Simply cut your biscotti while warm, space them a bit, keep them upright & return them to the oven for another 15-20 minutes.  Enjoy and happy baking!

This tastes great and not to mention is a snap to make. Some helpful hints:
1.Divide the dough while it's still in the bowl, preferably next to the sink so you can wet your hands and then scoop out and form the loaves. If your hands are wet, the stickiness will not be an issue. 
2. It's totally FINE to substitue a vegetable oil like canola if you don't have light olive oil --they are basically comparable (light olive oil is still olive oil but stripped of its flavor to cater to more "American" taste--you don't find light olive oil in Italy, for example).
3. The loaves WILL crumble during slicing, so just go slow, use a good serrated knife, and don't worry about perfection. These are homemade and IMHO are even better when they look a bit rustic. Who wants mass-produced looking biscotti??
4. Ovens vary so go by how your oven traditionally runs, hotter or cooler. I found that even though my oven thermometer indicated proper temp., I still had to increase the 2nd bake from 10 to 15 minutes. 
5. Finally, biscotti will harden as it cools so if you follow this recipe to a "T" you should have no problems. (Don't you just love it when people make all sorts of substitutions and then complain that the recipe doesn't work? ;-)

I messed up this recipe - I was out of vanilla and acidentally poured way too much almond extract in the mix. It still came out very good. Only problem was cutting them -- they break in half if you are not careful. They are so much better than store bought versions. I do receommend having a bowl of chilled water near you for dipping and rinsing your hands becasue the dough is super sticky.

I never dreamed I could make biscotti at home. This recipe was soooo easy and very delicious. I am planning on making more to give away as gifts for the holidays.

wow. these are amazing. and they were so much fun to make (once i finished shelling the pistachios). i let it cool for at least 15 minutes before i sliced it to avoid the crumbling. and i got about half of the serving amount. they taste great- i'm definitely making them again!

Great recipe,very versatile! You can use different fruits, nuts, and extracts for a variety of flavors. After making it thrice in one week,I've been able to improve on my 'technique'.The proportions & ingredients as given are fine,I have not changed those. Not enough space here to post the annotated recipe(u can msg me for that), so I am just posting some tips: -mix dry ingreds 1st so you don't have to use a 2nd measuring cup & mixing spoon -use canola or vegetable oil, not olive. olive flavor is too strong -put dough in fridge for 5 mins b4 dividing and shaping. --how to shape: don't use your hands-too messy. spray wax paper with pam. After 5 mins, take a spoon & use the side to separate the dough in half and then pull it out of the bowl onto the center of the oiled parchment paper. Then shape it into a skinny column/log by folding the paper around it. Then scrape the log off onto the lined cookie sheet. It is going to spread a bit and look too thin, but don't worry about it; it will rise. Repeat this paragraph with the 2nd half of the dough and put it on the same sheet. (the 2 blobs should be parallel to the short side) -during cooling, cover with a towel or kitchen mitts so they cool more gradually and don't crack. -use an even knife,not serrated. -Do not saw,press in with your body weight ---after cutting, flip paper &use your hand to help biscotti drop onto pan.lie them on their sides & throw out the paper.heat for 10mins more & enjoy :)

This has become my "go-to" biscotti recipe.  It can't fail.  I've made it many times with great success.  I did make some changes:  increased flour to 2 cups (because the dough was too soft and spread out too much), and used 1 cup pistachios, and 1 cup of cranberries.  Also tried substituting 1/4 cup dark brown sugar for 1/4 cup of the white sugar, and adding 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and 1 cup of chopped walnuts.  Delish!  Tasted like a "Toll House" biscotti.  Just recently I tried something new - replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with 1/2 cup Dutch-processed cocoa, used 1 tablespoon Frangelico (hazelnut liquor)and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla instead of the usual amount of vanilla and almond extracts and folded in 1 cup toasted hazelnuts and 1 cup semisweet chocolate chips - excellent Chocolate/Hazelnut biscotti.  I use an ice cream scoop to place the dough on the cookie sheets and then just use my spatula to join the scoops together.  No more sticky hands!

I seriously wish I could rate this one 20 stars!!!  This recipe is going to be a problem because these were intended to be for office Christmas gifts, but I think I'll have to make a couple more batches because this one isn't going to make it till Monday morning.   I didn't think Biscotti could taste this good!  I doubled the cranberries and added about 1 cup of pistachios.  I also added 1/2 tsp of orange extract.  Couldn't taste the olive oil at all, but that was probably because I used really good olive oil (who doesn't use good olive oil for cooking anyways?).  The dough is really sticky and somewhat hard to work with.  Listen to the tip that came with the recipe and wet your hands when shaping the logs.  I probably wet and rinsed my hands 10 times while shaping, but the end result was perfect.  Oh, and I did end up with 28 small cookies.  Make them small, 2" as directed.  THANK-YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE!!!!!

update:  I've made three batches of them this week for xmas gifts.  One reviewer recommended chilling the dough.  I chilled it for half an hour and it eliminated most of the stickiness!

Today, I made 10 batches of my variation of this recipe today to present as gifts (I sliced each batch to yield 24 biscotti instead of 36).  For my variation (which consistently received 5 stars and 2 thumbs up from my family and other recipients), I substituted 1 cup slivered almonds for the pistachios, increased the cranberries to 1 cup, and added 1/2 teaspoon orange extract.  As other reviewers have indicated, handling the dough with cool, wet hands and/or chilling the dough for five minutes prior to forming into logs makes preparation easy! My baking time for this recipe is 38 minutes in a 300 degree oven, 15 minutes cooling time before slicing with a non-serrated but very sharp knife, and 12 additional minutes for the 24 slices in a 275 degree oven.  Packaged with a small tin of cocoa or a small bag of gourmet coffee, these biscotti have become a wonderful gift for neighbors or a holiday party hostess.  (Drizzling with white or dark chocolate makes a pretty presentation!)  Everyone has commented that the soft interior texture of this biscotti balanced by its slightly crispy outer crust is a wonderful alternative to the often rock-hard commercially-baked biscotti.

These came out very good.  Based on tasting the dough I wasn't sure but by the time they were baked twice they were great.  I made mine with dried cherries and walnuts.  I used the dried cherries whole, but would chop them next time because the pieces were a bit too big.  I used half olive oil and half canola oil because I ran out of the olive oil, and that worked fine.  Also, I had to do the second baking longer than the recipe said, maybe about 12-15 minutes, to get them nice and hard the way I like them.  I have found that the sooner you are able to cut the logs after the first baking the cleaner they will cut.  The longer they cool, the more they will crumble.

These were excellent!  This was my first time to make biscotti, and I think they were actually easier than cookies, because there's not a lot of scooping to do, and I didn't have to get out my big mixer!  I halved the recipe and made a dozen, using 1/2 cup each of pistachios(I found shelled pistachios at Super WalMart) and cranberries.  I cooked them on silicone baking sheets.  I, too, had crumbling when I sliced them, until (on the third one)I realized that I needed to press down to cut, NOT saw back-and-forth; then, the slices came out perfectly!  I also dipped them in white chocolate; however, I thought that was a little too sweet for biscotti, so I will skip that step, next time.  Thanks for sharing; I will definitely make these again!

Have to give this a just OK rating as I'm not real excited about the olive oil flavor that sneaks through. Otherwise this is a good biscotti and I agree with the others who have added that hint of orange; I substituted orange extract for the almond.

These were way easier to make than I anticipated.  I could taste the olive flavor so I will use another type of oil next time.  I may add more cranberry next time as well.

Who can complain bout a cookie recipe made with olive oil instead of butter? These are so wonderful and taste better each day they sit in the cookie tin. I use this on my holiday cookie tray because of their color, taste and shape.  I always double the recipe and make just three loaves, not four. If one breaks while slicing them, you get to eat it. How bad can that be?

This was FANTASTIC!! It's a great base recipe to make any flavor biscotti you want! A great variation is upping the almond extract to 2 tsps., adding 1/4 tsp. cinnamon,  and adding 1 cup of sliced almonds omitting the cranberries and pistachio nuts. Then you could drizzle with milk and white chocolate and sprinkle with crushed almonds!! HINTS: 1) my dough was not workable at all!! I just spooned it onto the parchment lined pan and kinda molded it from there. 2) left my loaf in for 30 minutes and let cool with a dishtowel on top for 15 minutes and had no cracking problems. 3) used a large heavy knife, not serrated, and pressed down slowly. 4) cut my biscotti about 6 inches long and 1 inch wide and they had to dry in the oven for an hour at 275 flipping every 10 minutes.

I would give these more stars if I could!  These are excellent - not overly sweet and not hard as a rock! Simply perfect. I used 1c. of finely chopped walnuts instead of pistachios because that's what I had on hand.  I also upped the amount of cranberries to 3/4 c. The dough is very sticky, so definitely have a cup of chilled water to dip your fingers into.

I just wanted to say "Thank You" for posting this recipe.  I have made these about 10 times now and they come out perfect everytime.  My husband thinks these are better than the biscotti's sold by gourmet coffee shops.

This recipe is perfect AS IS.  There truly is no better cookie out there.   Don't listen to all of the "customized" comments or ones with strange "tips" or ingredient substitutions.  I have been making this recipe as written with ZERO changes for years and it is always a hit especially at holiday cookie swaps.   There truly is no better cookie out there.

I LOVE this recipe! I have done quite a few variations of it. So far the best seems to be the toffee version. I put in only toffee pieces and then dip them in melted butterscotch chips. I also have used whole wheat flour and margarine or canola oil with success. I do find that I have to do the second baking for much longer than 8 to 10 mins to achieve desired hardness. Also a bread knife is the only way to go when it comes to cutting these.

Absolutely delicious. Instead of pistachios and cranberries I used pecans as well as white and dark chocolate chunks. 1 cup pecans, chopped, and 1/2 cup each of white chocolate chunks and dark chocolate chunks. I baked them for 40 minutes, let them sit for about 15 minutes, and had no problem cutting them. I even cut them a bit too thin and small as I managed to get 45 out of this recipe.
For the second baking, I only baked for eight minutes, but I would recommend baking for 10 or even 12 minutes if you want more dry, coffeeshop style biscotti, rather than something a bit softer and crumblier.
Definitely wet your hands when shaping the dough as other reviewers have mentioned. I will for sure be trying this recipe with even more variations.

this is the easiest and fastest way to make an impression for a brunch, a dinner party, a gift, or just to have around. i have a small galley kitchen and i can get a batch made in an hour.  i dont use the almond extract, but it is just because i dont have any and never remember to buy it.  i bet they are slightly better with it but, i dont miss it . the colors are great at holiday time. i send them off to italy and they are loved over there too  -  especially because they dont have cranberries in italy.

I have made this recipe serveral times and it is the best biscotti I have ever made.  My colleauges beg me to bring it to work for coffee breaks and pot lucks.  I make it true to the recipes, however, do the second baking for a bit longer than suggested just to make sure it is extra crispy. Sometimes I also melt white chocolate baker's chocolate and dip half of the biscotti in white chocolate.  Delicious!

Wow...this recipe is truly worth all the five-star reviews it has! I did make a few very minimal changes that I think really made the recipe even more phenomenal than it already was. For starters, I had no light olive oil, so I used 2 tbs. canola oil mixed with 2 tbs. regular olive oil. I also used only 1 tsp. of vanilla extract, and added a 1/2 tsp. of orange extract along with the almond extract called for. This gave the biscotti a wonderful and delicate flavor combination. I upped the amount of cranberries to 3/4 cup, and since I had no pistachio nuts, I used chopped toasted pecans instead, and cut the huge amount of 1 1/2 cups down to 3/4, which was plenty. I found that the dough was way too soft to shape with my hands, so I used a knife to spread the dough out into the proper shape instead. This worked beautifully, and the "loaves" baked up just right. After the biscotti was cut, baked, and completely cool, I added a light drizzle of dark chocolate, which added a final delicious touch. These are really fabulous, and I'll definitely make them again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!

Great flavor and texture! I used almonds instead of pastachios. Everyone loved these. I will make them again and again! Make sure you pack the logs tight and flatten the top a bit. Also wait until they are cool to slice or they will crumble.

My family devoured it before it even cooled!  I changed it up a little bit.  I used cherry craisins and instead of all those pistachios, I used 1/2 cup slivered almonds and 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips. Next time, I will make a double batch!

Delicious! Crispy, crunchy and light enough to eat even without dipping in coffee. I really, really enjoy these. I had to add a bit more flour, until I got a sticky dough (it was like cake batter with the amount stated). Baking times and temps were perfect for me. I had no issue with crumbling, as long I was careful. I cut it as soon as it was cool enough to not burn me when holding it (around 5 min), using a serrated bread knife to saw through. I think I might add a few more cranberries next time, as this ended up being my favorite part! I drizzled them with an orange glaze made with icing sugar and orange juice. Yum! Make these! They are perfect.

These are fabulous and I'm making them again today.  I've made plain biscotti four times before this and these were a great change.  For anyone that's having trouble, don't give up.  Biscottis can be conquered!  Personally, I make the logs no more than three inches long because I found out the hard way how the batter spreads.  I had the longest biscotti in history the first time I made them.  Try to keep the loaves on the small side in height and width, but make sure your loaves aren't too thin on the edges (the slopes down).  Otherwise, when you cut them, you could lose the pointy tips.  Length wise doesn't matter.  Also, keep your hands wet when working with this batter (unless you feel like swearing and yelling)...When it comes to cutting, I've only used a serrated knife and cut them when they're hot, but not to hot to handle.  Even if you make them and it's a disaster, try them again and again, until you're happy with the results.  If a bad biscotti is my biggest problem this holiday season, bring it on!

This is a very delicous recipe.  Although the first time I tried it I used salted nuts and the added salt in the recipe, so it turned out very salty.  Be carefull if your using salted nuts and cut down on the added salt that is called for in the recipe.

Excellent and so very easy.  I substituted peanut oil for the olive oil and almond extract for the vanilla.  Actually pecans, almonds or walnuts are equally good. Reading the comments was a big help.  Wetting your hands when shaping the logs is a must!

Roads are icy and the pantry is bare.  I chose these because I'm out of butter and they call for lite olive oil which I had.  No cranberries, no nuts so I added anise seeds and still delicious.  Not quite sweet enough without cranberries.  Found two ancient squares of unsweetened choc so melted that with some corn syrup.  Beat it to shiny and dipped bottom of the biscotti in.  Wonderful.  Can't wait to try them again with all the ingredients.

Wonderful recipe! My husband and I love these! I made them with a little over a cup of craisins and a little over a cup of macadamia nuts, because that's what I had on hand. They turned out beautifully. They were great by themselves and even better dunked in coffee. I already have plans to make these again. I didn't have too much trouble with them breaking when I cut them. The couple that did, I just ate :)

Fabulous!  I loved all the nuts and berries!  Very flavorful.  For the second bake I left them for 10 minutes on one side, flipped them and baked for another 10 minutes.  I will use this base again with different add-ins.

SOOO Delicious.  I will be making these again and again.  I was skeptical at first about baking with olive oil over butter, but the result is amazing.    You HAVE to try this recipe.  Best biscotti I've ever eaten.   I used 1 cup sliced almonds and 1 cup dried cranberries... otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The 2nd round in the oven took 15-20min for the biscotti to get nice and hard.  Thank you for this recipe!

I read some suggestions here and I did the following: 1. I reduced pistachio to 1 cup (ok, that I did from laziness, because I had to "pill" these. 2. I added 1/2 TBSP of orange juice, I had no extract, so I used what I had 3. I wish I increased cranberries to 1 cup (will do next time) 4. I covered logs with towel once I took them out of oven and they didn't crack 5. I think mine needed a little bit longer than 35 min, they were pretty soft when I cut them (on other hand it was super easy to cut) 6. I used cold water for my hands - it was very helpful. Overall it was SUPER easy to make and they are SUPER tasty :)

Yum!  I have never made biscotti - I really enjoyed this.  I used only 1/2 c sugar and used all wheat pastry flour.  I also used almonds instead and only used 3/4 c.  When I pulled it out of the oven from the first baking it was only BARELY browned.  It sliced nicely.  I actually liked eating it then just fine.  Might not bother with the next baking next time around.  I used EVOO - no issues.

Really good biscotti, I didn't have pistachios so I used some almonds (about 1C), and instead of almond extract I added some orange zest.  I found the dough was quite hard to work with but in the end my logs came out well.  Oh I also ended up with way more than 36 biscuits, maybe the way I cut them?  I let them cool for at least 30 mins and just pushed down with a serrated knife, no sawing needed. 7-31-2011 Update: I replaced 1/4c flour with cocoa and used choc chips instead of fruit, amazing!

This was my first attempt at biscotti and I was very happy with the result.  The biscotti was popular among those who aren't crazy about very sweet desserts.  We also had them for breakfast on Christmas Eve since everyone was rushing around.  Very nice recipe.

GREAT BISCOTTI I love this recipe - I made last year for holiday gifts and made my first batch of the season for this year - I substitute pistachio's for almonds and add a bit of orange zest. Dip in melted white chocolate for something a little different.

A-W-E-S-O-M-E-! No substitutions at all. My diet consists of Vegan with a Culinary Degree and these were s-p-o-t on. TIPS BELOW: I wouldn't add any more flour like some did. When you shape the dough on the parchment paper, just grab 1/2 from the bowl slap it on the paper, lengthen it then flatten it to about 3/4 of an inch or so. The way you shape and form it will pretty much be the way it comes out. These are like mini Biscotti's I took them out of the oven at 35 minutes, let them rest for 5 minutes then sliced them with a regular CHEFS KNIFE. DO NOT CUT THEM SLOW >> I REPEAT, JUST USE A CHEF KNIFE AND CUT THEM FAST, YOU WILL THANK ME FOR THEM, RIGHT DOWN THE LINE AS THICK OR AS THIN AS YOU WANT!. After I cut them, I gently transferred them onto NEW parchment paper, the same way I cut them (not on the sides) for about 15 minutes, took them out, cooled, and most of them were gone before they were cooled.
I got about 25 out of 2 loaves and had 7 left :)I used 1 cup of cranberries fresh) NOT bagged. I cooked(the cranberries in water and sugar for 6 minutes to a boil to crack the shell and get them soft. I used 1 cup of pistachios, cut up slightly, I like them junky and that exactly what they were, mmmmmmmmmmmm~! I drained the cranberries, put them into my sunbeam professional blender, I took the pistachios and put them in, and turned it on low. The dough was red and green from the pistachios and fresh cranberries. I did not mix anything by hand at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
loaves.

Fantastic recipe as is!!  I drizzle with powdered sugar glaze!  I use an electric knife to slice and it works beautifully, even cutting through the pistachios/nuts!!  Thank you for such a great recipe!  I am not a big biscotti fan, but couldn't quit eating this!!!   :o)

Great depth of favor and texture.  Only changes are 3 additions:  1) Brush loaves with egg yolks prior to cooking.  2) If using parchment paper to line cookie sheet, take cooled loaves off paper prior to cutting slices (slices stick a bit). 3) After slices cooled, drizzle with white chocolate, adds a nice look and little extra sweetness.  Definitely try this recipe!!!!!

My favorite Christmas cookie. If a not-too-sweet cookie is on your mind, this will do.  Every time I make these, they are the quickest to disappear,  4 different varieties.  The cranberries are a surprise in the mouth and go perfect together with the pistachios. I wouldn't substitute another nut for this particular recipe.

These were wonderful!  I had never made Biscotti before, but will be making it again.  I did not have any pistachio so I used almonds, and used fried cherries instead of cranberries.  They didn't last long. I am going to try them with a lot of different nut and fruit combinations.  These were not dry and hard like the store bought kind. Thank you for the excellent receipe.

I have always used Giadda's (Food Network) biscotti recipe, but I saw this made with olive oil which would be different, so I made these today. Although the taste was okay, the dough was too messy to work with.  I get the "hint" of olive oil when I eat them. Probably need lemon or something stronger to get rid of the oil flavor.  I gave it a try, but I will go back to Giadda DeLaurentis' recipe. Should have stayed with what I knew was excellent.

Nice and easy.  Omitted the pistachios, added almonds and orange zest.  Will use again and again with all the different combos.  Anise and poppyseed next batch and will freeze!

This recipe made me look like a baking wizard.  I made these for Christmas gifts for my work friends.  They gave them rave reviews.  This was actually my first try at biscotti.  I don't know why I was intimidated to make biscotti but this is such and easy recipe.  I did make these ahead and froze them for about three weeks.  I used walnuts instead of pistachios and drizzled white chocolate over them.  This made them look professional and added more depth and mild sweetness.  I used cold water on my fingers to shape the logs on parchment paper.  I let them cool a few minutes before cutting and used a sharp bread knife and had no problems with crumbling.  Great recipe...thanks for posting!

Delicious and so easy to make.  I used 1 c. cranberries and 1 c. pistachios and added 1 t of orange extract.  I followed others suggestions and covered with a towel when cooling, to prevent cooling.  I also made sure the loaves were completely cool before cutting.  Used a regular knife and pressed down - no breakage or crumbling.

These were simple, easy, and beautiful when finished! I used only a cup of pistachios (because that's all I had), and it seemed to be plenty. I'll make these every holiday season.

Great taste and I have tried several of the variations in previous reviews.  So this is just hints.  Use two non stick spatulas to shape logs.  I always seem to have one log with more dough so I just make that one longer.  I have also used a spatula in one hand and nonstick foil in the other.  You can make light olive oil by mixing in canola oil to regular oil.  My mix is only 1/3 olive and the rest canola.

Great recipe.  I only got 18 biscottis out of this recipe.  Mine are regular biscotti size I think.... I decreaed the pistachios to 1 cup and increased the cranberries to 1 cup.  I soaked the cranberries in hot water while I was prepareing the rest of the ingredients to soften them up a bit.  Also didn't use parchment paper.  I greased the cookie sheat with olive oil and had no problems with it.

Amazing and beautiful too! Made these exactly as the recipe says and they are to die for. Pistachio's do have a distinctive taste, so if you're not a fan use almonds. Made a second batch with this as the base but added almonds and cocoa powder in place of cranberries and pistachios - still good but needed something. I will use this as the base for all my future biscotti making. Perfect texture - nice crunch but won't crack any teeth. ;)

This is a fantastic recipe as written and does not need any modifications. My biscotti turned out perfectly. I did not add the salt, only because I used salted pistachios, and I did crush the pistachios into smaller pieces.

I'm sure it was something I did (or didn't do), but I was so disappointed in these.  I followed the instructions exactly (wasn't brave enough to be inventive).  The dough was a booger-bear to work with, the logs did not spread or rise in the least, and they did not slice cleanly.  Came out pretty craigy and crumbly.  The crumbs are tasty, but not of a quality for the gift giving I intended.  Wish they had turned out like the photo!

I usually don't like biscotti but I think these are delicious! I like the use of olive oil instead of butter, too...it makes them cheaper to make and a little healthier.

Very good. Used almond slivers, didn't use almond extract and upped the vanilla extract to 2 1/2 teaspoons. Worked out very well.

AWESOME!!  I cut the pistachios back to 1 cup and kept the cranberries at 1/2 cup, might increase it the next time to 3/4 or 1 cup.  Baking time was a longer than stated in recipe (about 45 min before slicing, and then another 40 min after slicing - not sure how these could ever be done after only 8 minutes!) My husband LOVED them.  Will certainly be making more for the holidays!

I have never made biscotti but enjoy eating it. Very easy recipe. I used dried cherries and pistachios. I cut cherries in 1/2 because of size. Used 1c. pistachios because my fingers were sore. When I looked at the log on the wax paper I was thinking there is no way that is going to turn out right. But I was amazed that it did. Not only is it soooooo much better than store bought, it is quite attractive. I would think that you could make this into a drop cookie too. I was thinking adding raisins instead of other fruit and omitting almond flavor and add cinnamon to make a cinn raisin biscotti. That might be the next time. Delicious !!!

I don't like biscottis myself, so I can't rewiew the taste, but my family LOVED it. The recipe was easy to follow and the biscottis came out absolutely perfect! They were nice and firm, and not crumbly.

I had never made biscotti before so I was a little nervous but I shouldn't have been.  They turned out great.  I made them for Christmas gifts for my co-workers so I made multiple batches and then drizzled a third of them with white chocolate, a third with dark chocolate and left the other third plain.  What I really liked about these was that they were not rock hard like some store-bought biscotti I've had.  I don't know if that is how they should be but I prefer them that way.  My co-workers liked them too.  If I was ever going to make biscotti again then I would use this recipe.

Not eactly the kind of biscotti I'm used to, but still pretty good. Definitely make sure you use a light olive oil. I used EVOO and it had a very strong taste in the dough. Also, my batter didn't come together well so I used a splash of apple juice to reduce the oilve-y taste and to create a less crumbly batter. I substituted sliced almonds for the pistachios. The batter was very sticky and hard to work with. Even after dong the twice-baking they weren't the hard. The next day they were much firmer.  This was my first attempt at this type of cookie. I may also try using another more neutral-tasting oil as I don't buy light olive oil.

GREAT RECIPE !! I also added orange zest. Next time just to keep the cost down and to have enough Pistachio's for another batch I will use only 1 cup of nuts. This was fabulous !!

These turned out great!  I would recommend adding the orange zest (I did for 1/2 of mine and I like them better).  I also dipped them in white chocolate.  They came out nice and crispy, but not too dry like some commercially produced biscotti.  I will definitely be making these again!

This recipe is fantastic and can easily be used with different variations.  As we speak, I have roasted almond & toffee biscotti baking in the oven :)  I've made this recipe over and over and it is incredible.  Some of the best substitutions I've tried - 3/4 cups mini dark chocolate chips, 3/4 cups roasted almonds, 1/2 cup dried cherries; No nuts, just 1 cup Andes Creme de Menthe baking bits; and 1 1/2 c roasted almonds with 1/2 finely chopped crystallized ginger.  This recipe is incredibly flexible and is definitely the best I've tried.

I love this biscotti & so does everyone to whom I've given it! I made a couple of changes - but nothing drastic. Instead of using pistachios, I used slivered almonds, as some other reviewers said the pistachios were too chunky. Didn't have almond extract - just used real vanilla extract and it came out fine. But I'm sure that almond extract would make it nicer. It's true that you really need to have wet hands to mold these. I poured clean cold water in a separate mixing bowl and it made things go a lot quicker and easier. To dress the finished biscotti  up a bit for the holidays, I dipped one side in white chocolate and then drizzled melted dark chocolate on top of that using an up-and-down motion with a spoon. I used white chocolate/dark chocolate compound and melted it in the microwave with 1-2 Tbsp of Crisco (helps it glaze better) for 30-40 seconds. Gotta watch it though 'cause it will burn easily. Take it out at 20 seconds and swirl it with a spoon, then put it back in for the next 10-20 seconds. Gives it just the right amount of sweetness with the cranberry-almond combination!  I love giving them out for the holidays. I've already made 2 batches (of 72 servings each time) this holiday season and am going to make them one more time this month! Everyone raved about these!

Great Biscotti recipe!  I chopped and toasted the almonds (i had raw whole almonds) to bring out the flavor.  Also the batter is really wet.  It wasn't even handlable.  I just spread it on the pan with my spatula.  So I was a little worried, but it turned out great.  I also dipped them in semi-sweet chocolate.  But I think it would have been better with white chocolate to make it more festive!

Love it!  Don't know if any will even make it until Christmas!!  Followed recipe exactly (except to chop the nuts and craisins). Had absolutely no issues with stickiness, crumbling, dryness etc.  They came out beautifully!  Will have to hide the rest from my husband so others can try them!!

What I love about these biscotti - the use of olive oil, the lovely red and green coloring, the taste!  Yes, the dough is sticky, but what I did is spooned the batter on to two cookie sheets.  Then I wetted my hands and shaped the loaves rather easily.  I did not experience any cracking with the slicing.  I cooled them on a plastic cutting board, flipped the loaves over, and put them in the fridge for a bit.  Then I cut them (they were a little warm to touch still).  I placed a non-serrated knife on top.  Gently pressed it into the top, the pressed hard to finish the cut.  Gentle at first to start the slice though.  I plan to make another batch tonight.

My mother-in-law and family loved these. I will say that the dough came out a lot stickier and wet than the other Biscotti I made.  I had to dry it for much longer. i drizzeled white chocolate over it and it was very festive.

This recipe is not a traditional biscotti.  It is softer and more cookie like.  People who "do not like" biscotti seem to like this.  You do not have to "dunk" this to eat it.  I have also found that this is fairly dental work friendly, for a biscotti.  
I have made many iterations of this with different fruit, nuts or extracts and it seems to be very flexible.  It is VERY easy, but wetting your hands to handle the dough is the ONLY way to go.  It does tend to spread while cooking, so keep the logs only 2-3 inches wide.
I am now required to make this every year at Christmas time!

You can't beat this recipe for biscotti.  It is easy, delicious, and can be adapted to many flavors.  A hint for forming logs . . . put dough in a large ziplock bag, cut a corner, and pipe out the desired size of your log.  To fill the big easily, place over a large glass with the bag's top hanging over the outside of the glass.  Works great and saves a sticky mess.  A little water on your fingers will also help you to form the logs.  Have fun!

I used almonds instead of pistachios, added 1 Tbs of orange zest and dipped in chocolate. They were delicious!

I just made these again after three years. I used slivered almonds with the cranberries and drizzled with white chocolate. They are so good and easy to make. My grown kids came to visit and had to take some home. Thanks again for a great Christmas time recipe!

For a healthier alternative, I substituted xylitol (sugar alternative) for the sugar and spelt flour for the all-purpose flour.  Less calories, but same great taste!

This is a wonderful biscotti recipe!  I decreased the amount of pistachios by about half, chopped them roughly and used some very high quality olive oil I brought back from Israel...delicious!  I would recommend suggestions to use olive oil for this recipe to improve the shelf life of the biscotti.

This is my favorite biscotti recipe!  Everyone loves them!  Most people say they like them a little softer than the usual store bought biscotti, so the baking directions are spot-on for me!  They make great teacher gifts too!

I was very disappointed in this recipe given how many rave reviews there were.  I use the anise almond biscotti recipe on this website that uses butter and just added pistachios & cranberries instead of almonds and anise seed. Works perfectly and tastes great!

The best biscotti! Inspired many conversations regarding the difference between this and the kind of huge, bland, hard-as-a-rock "biscotti" you find in coffee shops. Many native Italians have gushed that they have not had such authentic biscotti in America ever! A huge hit with folks of all tastes, this recipe has been passed on and on. 100% recommended with alterations or not. I chop 2/3 of my pistachio nuts and 2/3 of cranberries to ease cutting.

Smells lovely while baking, tastes fantastic when finished!  I omitted the vanilla and almond extracts as I didn't have any on hand, and I added the zest of one orange plus about a tbsp of orange juice.  After cutting the loafs I had to bake for about 30 minutes to achieve the crispy texture I like.

Oh my, these turned out wonderfully. The dough is not normal biscotti dough -- I tried to form logs, and "form logs" is misleading. What it means is, "pat gooey mess into log shape") and I thought they'd never turn out right, but they did! I had to use EVOO as I don't have light oil and surprisingly I don't detect the olive oil flavor, which is great. Had to add some cashews to make up the full 1.5 cups of pistachios. I drizzled them with a simple glaze though I wished I had had white chocolate to use! Thanks for the recipe, these were a great way to use up my pistachios!

Good and very easy for my first try at biscotti. I used slivered almonds instead of pistachios. Nice and light - not hard and crunchy. Husband loved it. I wish I had some white chocolate to dip or drizzle on top because it isn't very sweet and I LOVE a sweet treat :)

These were amazing!  I was hesitant to even try biscotti, these are the first I've ever made and the recipe was perfect!  I substituted pecans for the pistachios, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  The whole process was much easier than I expected -- even cutting through the loaf -- no crumbling at all!  Delicious!

Update: I've been making these for several years now.  I make them all the time and this is my TOP cookies recipe.  I love that they use olive oil instead of butter.  They are a relatively health treat, the recipe is perfect as is, and you can sub any kind of dried fruit and nuts.  I've done cranberry pecan, apricot pecan, prune walnut, ,etc.  Anything is delicious!  People love them, and I actually find the whole process of making them straight-forward and quick.

By far my favorite biscotti recipe. Didn't change a thing, just added some clementine zest to the batter. The olive taste totally disappear after baking, no worries there ;-).

Just made these they are in oven browning right now.  I cut off the ends and tasted wow fantatic.  I substitued pecan because I didn't have pistachios any nut you like would still be great.  I was a little concerned with the softness of the dough but it worked great.  I also didn't have light olive oil and used canola oil.  This is a keeper.

These were so simple to make, although I had a lot of them crumble when I cut them with a serrated knife. Our grocery store had shelled pistachios in 2-lb. bags so that really made the recipe easy! We really enjoyed these.

This is a beautiful holiday cookie.  The green and red colors are very festive.  Not to mention it's very tasty.  I had salted pistachios, so I left out the salt and they came out great.

Very good recipe.  I used pecans and caramel chips in the biscotti and coated the bottoms with milk chocolate.  The dough was almost like cake batter, and it took 20 minutes to dry.  Other than that, this recipe is wonderful!  Taste better on the third day.

I made these biscotti to go along with my Christmas cookie trays and they were delicous! Not to sweet, but full of taste. I love that this is made with olive oil and not butter. These are a keeper! I may experiment with choclate chips and macadameia nuts next time.

Took these to a cookie exchange and they were a hit. These are not hard and crunchy, you don't even need to dip them in coffee to eat like most biscotti. I also added orange zest

These were fantastic!  I used dried cherries instead of  cranberries because it was what I had on hand.  Next time, I think I might put white chocolate chips in the batter with them to avoid the hassle of dipping them in chocolate. Thanks for the great recipe!

I used butter instead of olive oil, and they turned out fine. The yield was smaller than the recipe stated, but I was sort of expecting that. These make a nice little Christmas present, but are enough of a pain that I wouldn't make them just for myself and family.

This recipe was an instant success within my circle of family and friends. I use raisins and a walnuts instead of cranberries and pistachio nuts; I absolutely adore this recipe. You should most definitely try this, you'll love it.

Excellent.  I did  have to increase the bake some a bit, not sure why but I had some trouble with getting it browned a bit.  Otherwise, they were delicious.  Next time I might decrease the amount of cranberries and nuts, but that's just a personal preference.  Delicious!

AMAZING, and fairly easy! I used the tip about dipping hands in cold water before handling the biscotti dough and it worked like a charm!  I've also made this recipe with almonds and chocolate chips (for a more cost effective batch for work) and it came out superb!   For crispier biscotti I recommend increasing the bake time to 35 minutes for initial bake, then 10 minutes on EACH side after them have been sliced.  Also, PARCHMENT paper is a must and comes out perfect every time!

This recipe is awesome.  I use it as a base for other flavors of biscotti too.  I love the cranberries and pistachios at Christmas, the biscotti is the perfect color.  I have tried this recipe for  chocolate with almonds and cranberries with almonds, especially when I don't have almond extract.

Wow, much better than store-bought! I also used slivered almonds instead of pistacios, and upped the almond extract another half teaspoon. I made half the batch plain and the other half I dipped in melted chocolate and dusted with chopped almonds. Definitely wet your hands with cool water before handling the logs before baking. They will be much easier to handle. Oh, and if  you want to use these for coffee dipping, make sure they're baked long enough the second time and nice and crispy. Thanks very much for the recipe!

These were good and easy to make.  Though I've personally come to enjoy brick-hard biscotti, I think this will appeal to more people since it is a little softer - dry, but not hard.  I left out the salt (since the pistachios were salted)  and used margarine in place of the olive oil.

This recipe is great!  I have used so many alternatives to the cranberries/pistachios and it always turns out great.  Just today i used coconut and topped with chocolate, macadamia nuts and chocolate chips, I added some cocoa in place of flour and added peppermints.  Always great.  I just keep the add in's to about one cup or so and the extracts to the 2 1/2 teaspoons and it is great!  Yes you will have to wet your hands to handle the sticky dough but this recipe has not failed me yet in the over a dozen variations I have made.  Thank you Gerry.   I have so many people wanting this treat and even more wanting me to teach them how to make it!-- i have refrained so far I want to keep it as my secret.   Extra bonus is that is only uses a 1/4 cup of olive oil.

Fantastic! I followed the ingredient amounts exactly and they came out great. I used Craisins for the cranberries. I also used a food chopper to chop up the pistachios and Craisins just a little.  After baking the first time, I covered the logs with a towel to keep them from cracking. I had to bake for 40-45 mins instead of 35 mins. Then after slicing the cookies, I baked them for 15 minutes on each side (30 mins total). They are so so good!

Great taste, but dough was *very sticky*! Used spatula and wax paper to shape; turned out fine. A little salty - I hadn't realized pistachios were salted and added salt per recipe. Definitely a rougher texture than "Biscotti" recipe I reviewed, but mine did not fall apart. I let mine rest overnight between 1st bake and slicing for second bake. 300 degrees for 2nd bake. Mine spread quite a bit so I would make loaves narrower next time. As was, it yielded 26 3/8" wide pieces. Will try "Biscotti Tosconi" next...

I have been making this recipe for 3 years now and everyone loves it. I have never strayed from the recipe. It is one of the favorites I give at Christmas. I make at least 5 types every year. I understand everyone has made minor or major changes to the recipe but if you have I suggest you repost the recipe. It confuses people and some changes are really not that great, it makes it a totally different biscotti recipe.

I was very impressed with this! I don't normally like biscotti because of that "licorice" taste, but these do not have that as they are made with almond and vanilla extracts. I followed other reviews and cooled my "loaves" under a dish towel for 15 minutes before cutting. They did not crack and the pistachios didn't cause any difficulty in slicing the knife through the cookies. I bought salted, shelled pistachios and used exactly the amounts of both the pistachios and cranberries that the recipe called for. I will definitely be making these again (my co-workers all said I absolutely have to!). I also cooked the cookies after slicing for around 15-18 mins (flipping once) and found them to have a perfect crunch on the outside with a not-too-hard center. Didn't need coffee to soften these up at all!

This is the first review that I have ever posted on this site, and I have been using AR for a couple of years now.  I followed the directions exactly (except for cutting the pistachios down to 1/2 cup)and received rave reviews at work. I thinned some white chocolate with canola oil for dipping. I did not cut in a sawing fashion, but in a downward fashion, and it turned out well. Thank you for an AMAZING biscotti recipe!

So easy to make and oh my goodness delicious.  One tip though, buy pre-shelled pistachios, shelling that many is murder on your fingers.

I used currants instead of cranberries.  With the pistachios being so large it worked better to have something small in the mix too.

Very good but the dough was very sticky, it is easier to just scoop it onto the tray and form the log shape with a spatula rather than with your hands.

The most challenging part of this recipe is trying not to eat all the batter before it goes into the oven. My only change would just be to forget crisping it back in the oven again. This recipe would be great just as your basic cookie, and really won't last long enough on a plate that you need to worry about them going stale.

Oh my!  These were magnificent!!!  I used finely chopped almonds (instead of the pistachio) then added the zest of one orange, 1/8 t. Orange extract, and 1/4 t.  combined ground cardamom and star anise.  I will be making these all the time.  As for the stickiness of the dough, really- just wet your hands and shape!  So easy & scrumptious!  I do have to add that my total baking time was way longer than stated in the recipe, but well worth the 'baby sitting' that I had to do with these.  Again- excellent!!  Grazie!!

I made this recipe twice. First, I followed the recipe exactly! I did not love the flavor. Although, it is very tender. Second time I substituted 1/4 cup flour with cocoa powder. Tasted good but not five stars.

***** I divided the dough in half and put on a floured surface, sprinkled a little flour on top and formed the dough into a log.  No sticky hands!!!! Then did the same to form the second log.  After baking for 35 min; then cooling for 10 min. cut into slices with a "heavy chef knife; no crumbling.  An excellent recipe.  Will make again.  Also, drizzled with white chocolate.  Mmmmmmmmmmmm.

I just made these but made some small alterations to your recipie for a healthier version! Needless to say they've turned out fantastic! I used self-raising wholemeal flour instead of all purpose flour and baking soda. I also used 1 egg instead of two and used a mix of almonds and black currants! Hubby is digging into them now!!!! Amazing! I will definitely be making these again!

Great biscotti, perfect with coffee.  Loved it with the end dipped in melted chocolate.

I've tried so many different biscottis and I love the flavors and texture of these. The combo of vanilla and almond extract is so good. I have been making these once a week to eat with my coffee every morning. I do use canola oil instead of the light olive oil. I only have evoo in the house and that would be too strong. I also use walnuts instead of pistachios only because I have a giant bag of walnuts right now.

I made this at Christmas for gifts to the family - it was a huge hit! My in-laws hid their so it would last longer and just found it last week. After 3 1/2 months in a jar in a cupboard it was still just as delicious as Christmas Eve when it was fresh! I have successfully converted my husband to a biscotti fan - but only my biscotti :)

Super easy to make. I made a double batch and stored them in a ziplock bag in the freezer. They take no time at all to thaw when you take some out short notice.

Really yummy - everyone loved them. I found that they cracked if I left them to cool for too long the warmer they are when you cut them the less they will crack.  I also used a sharp bread knife to do a single slice/chop through the dough. The second time after the 10 minutes of baking, I turned off the oven and let them dry inside. This gave them the perfect hardness. I added white chocolate drizzle to top them. These went as teachers holiday gifts for the second year in a row and I got nothing but rave reviews and the kids were happy.

these are a true crowd pleaser - i've made them four or five times, and my mom, who hates baking, has asked me to make them for her twice so that she can learn how by watching.  i like to make the loaves small so that the end product is miniature, which looks very cute on a cookie plate.

Wow!  These are good!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I used extra virgin olive oil because I hadn't noticed that it called for light olive oil.  Amazingly good.  I did something wrong, though, because mine came out a bit soft even after I left them in the oven to cool with the door slightly open instead of letting them cool on the counter.   Also, they were so easy and fast to make.  Before I knew it I had finished preparing the dough.  I actually blurted out, "That's it?"

These turned out fantastic. I didn't have the pistachio nuts  so used slivered almonds instead.  The cold water on your hands tip worked great.  This is such a easy recipe with basic ingredients I'm sure I will be making these again and again.  I tried dipping some in chocolate but didn't like them as well.

Really good and very easy!  I had no trouble cutting the cookies after the first baking.  Just hold the knife over the loaf and push it straight down, firmly.  Right through the nuts, no crumbling except on the very ends where the dough was thinner and drier.

Great recipe - very easy to follow.  I only used one cup of pistachios and it was enough.  I dipped them in melted white chocolate.  They were just like biscotti you would buy in a cafe.

"Best biscotti I've ever had," said my father-in-law. Use salted pistachios. If you want crispy  pieces, toast at least 15 minutes.

Although I am an Italian-American, this was first attempt at making biscotti.  I wanted o test out my new stand mixer so I doubled the recipe.  I used 2 cups total for the nuts and about 1.5 c of the cranberries.  The dough was a bit sticky even after I added a bit more flour.  Next time I will likely add a bit more flour to make the dough more managable.  I also added the zest of one medium orange.  They are so easy to make and especially delicious!    I may try dipping some in chocolate if they last long enough for me to get around to that!  I will definitely be making these on a regular basis!

Easy, got rave reviews, and worked out as directed in orig recipe. Dough is sticky but not unmanageable. Wet hands. Used 1 cup pistachios and 1 cup mini choc chips. A keeper, thanks for sharing.

I thought this was really good.  Easy to make too.  I lessened the amount of nuts and used craisans instead.  I don't understand how other reviewers thought to dough was ungodly sticky....mine was very manageable and I used water on my hands to help it not stick.  I dipped half in white choc too.  People who like biscotti loved mine.

Cons: Not sure what all the fuss was about. I thought these were "just OK." Too much sugar - could easily reduce to 1/2 cup. Biscotti with whole grain, i.e., kamut, much more flavorful than white flour. I like the idea of using olive oil, perhaps a combination of olive oil/butter would be worth trying. Pro: Easy to make, sticky, but the wet hands trick works. Can taste/smell the olive oil in the raw, but once cooked they were fine. No problem cutting, just be sure not to overbake, press down firmly, evenly from top.

I've made this several times this year.  This is by far the most authentic biscotti recipe that I've come across.  Using the olive oil is a must in my opinion.  I've made this using pecans as well as pistachios...both are fantastic.

5 Star Plus - Some of the reviewers mentioned that they chop up the pistachios in order to avoid the problem of the biscotti crumbling when being cut after the first bake.  In my opinion what makes this recipe a 5 Star Plus is that it not only tastes delicious, it is also beautiful and festive with big chunks of green pistachios accented by bright red cranberries.  I've tried this recipe with both raw and roasted pistachios and this is what I've found.  The best way to avoid crumbly biscotti is to use raw pistachios.  I find mine at Whole Foods Market.  The raw nuts have the needed moisture in them so when you bake them the first time they don't completely dry out and you can easily cut them with a sharp knife (no need to use a serrated knife) for a super clean edge beautiful biscotti.  The second bake will finish "roasting" the nuts.   Hope this helps.

I found this recipe in Allrecipes' wonderful "tried & true cookie" book, but just had to hop online to rate it. I always thought that biscotti was difficult to make, but this recipe is so easy! Well, there is shelling the pistachios of course, but the rest is a breeze. And it's delicious to boot.

I normally don't review, but this deserves one.  I have made this recipe several times and I haven't found a better one.  I do have a problem with the temperature and time however.  I have settled on 350 for 25 minutes in a KA Biscotti pan.  I cool them for 5 minutes in the pan and 10 minutes out of the pan.  After slicing I lay them on a cooling rack in a pan and bake for 15 minutes at 325, turn them over and bake 15 minutes the other side.

Wow, this is good!  This was my first time making biscotti and this recipe made it easy.  After reading lots of reviews I made the following changes:  I increased the almond extract to 1 tsp.; used 1 cup dried orange/cranberries and 1 cup slivered almonds (instead of pistachios); added about 2 tsp. orange zest (whatever amount I could get from 1 orange).  Using parchment paper and wetting your hands with water are a must.  Yes, the dough is sticky but with wet hands it's really not hard to form the "logs."  Mine weren't really logs, they looked more like flattened loaves of bread when I put them in the oven, but they turned out a nice size and shape, spreading and rising a little as they cooked.  I followed the recommended oven temperatures which seemed perfect.  After the first baking, I put the cookie sheet on a cooling rack and covered the biscotti with a towel and let it cool 10 minutes.  Using an electric knife made cutting a breeze--perfect, no crumbling.  For the second baking I started with 8 minutes, then turned the biscotti over and baked an additional 3 minutes and I think this was just right.  The biscotti was crisp but not hard or crumbly.  I dipped half in melted white chocolate and the other half I drizzled with melted milk chocolate.  The taste is just heavenly, the texture perfect, and the process wasn't as difficult as I anticipated.  I'll definitely make these again.

I followed the recipe pretty much as written and this is an excellent base recipe. I found it a little too sweet so I will decrease the sugar by 1/4 cup next time. I used 1 tsp of almond extract this time and found it wasn't enough to bring the almond flavoring. I would go for another 1/2 to 1 extra tsp of almond extract next time. I actually can't taste the almond. I just used regular olive oil (who has light?) and whole wheat flour to make them healthier and with fiber. I will try the orange zest next time because I think that will give this the kick it needs, but again, wonderful recipe as is. I attempted to make the 2 logs and found them not staying in their shapes, but instead expanding wider and wider as I would be working on one log, then quickly switching to the other to keep its 2 by 12 shape. So what I did was quickly make them as perfect as possible and rush them into the oven. They seemed so flat in the oven until I cut them diagonally, then they started to look like biscotti. These won't be the gigantic ones you buy at coffee shops or stores but will still be of decent size. You can really alter this recipe to however suits your taste which I like. Throw in whatever nuts or dried fruits, chocolate, toffee, whatever. These are great. Thanks for sharing. Now I have to work on tweaking it to what I like...

Yes, they're crumbly but who cares...these are the tastiest biscottis I've ever had! Added a teaspoon orange extract, dipped bottoms in semi sweet chocolate chip. My friend ate one and gave it to her husband, both said they were very divine and asked for the recipe. Thanks Gerry!

I made this for the very first time this morning....I used slivered almonds and cranberries, a Tablespoon orange zest.... And melted almond bark to cover one side after slicing... And wow, it is yummy.... I did not make a log, or held the dough, i simply used my spatula, and made 2 flat long lines, and it came out beautiful.... Covered it with towel for 10 minutes, and when i cut it diagonally, it sliced perfectly. My boyfriend is half Italian, and he went to culinary school... And he said, its better than his grandma's biscotti.... I am so happy he said that.. Thank you for the recipe....

My first biscotti recipe, and it was FABULOUS. I cannot believe how good these were. I used diced almonds instead of pistachios, used the full amount of cranberries, and dipped them in white chocolate. Again, WOW WOW WOW!

Just tried this recipe this morning.  Didn't have all the ingredients, so I tried substituting.  Did not add almond extract or pistachio nuts as I did not have any.  Added orange zest to the recipe, along with 1 cup choc chips in place of the pistachios.  Was very nervous as this was my first time making biscotti, but the experience was incredible! I didn't have light olive oil, so I used vegetable oil instead, and added a few drops to the sheet pan so the logs wouldn't stick.  This came out really handy as my hands were wet with oil, which made forming the logs a breeze!  I got 24 cookies out of the recipe.  Will definitely keep this recipe and try other variations in the future!!

I just finished making this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner (tomorrow). It is indeed a very soft dough, as any traditional biscotti recipe I've ever made has been. The key is to NOT form logs. Just divide the dough into two 9x5 meatloaf pans (I use Pyrex) and bake as directed. Pop them out when still piping hot (make sure you use Pam/flour on the pans), and slice them immediately before they get a chance to set. I have a Henckel Twin Four Star II bread knife that does the job beautifully, no broken pieces or crushing or broken pieces. The trick is NOT to push down; let the knife do the work. Use gentle sawing motions with any decent serrated knife. LOVE this recipe! The olive oil adds a fantastic flavor. Will definitely make it again!  :)

This was pretty good biscotti. The logs were hard to form because the dough was soft, and I honestly thought it wasnt going to turn out. It baked up fine, but even with a few minutes extra baking in the second stage I found them to be rather soft. Also, 1 cup of nuts and cranberries was way too much. I used about 2/3 of each and it was still a lot.

They were really good.  My 1 year old and 2.5 year old loved the plain ones I made them.  I substituted 1/4 cup of dates and 1/4 cup of almonds. My husband couldn't believe that I made them!

These were good (hubby didn't like them at all but he's pretty picky).  I left out the almond extract & subbed 1c of the AP flour for whole wheat pastry flour.  I used about 3/4 c cranberries & 3/4 c chopped pecans instead of pistachios.  I got about 24 out of one recipe & had to bake them 15 minutes the second time.  After cooling they still weren't hard in the middle so I baked them for another 12 minutes at 275.  I'll try some different ingredients & spices & maybe decrease the sugar just a tad next time.  This is an easy base recipe I'll definitely use in the future.

Great recipe! I followed the advice of other reviewers and upped the cranberries and added less pistaciao. These were so wonderful and I game them as homemade christmas presents last year. Even my cousin from Italy said they were the best biscotti he ever had!

Didn't have light olive oil, so I used half extra virgin and half vegetable, don't think it made much difference.  Didn't want to pay the price for shelled pistachios, so I used roughly chopped raw almonds instead.  Added some orange zest, because it seems to go so well with dried cranberries.  Couldn't mix the almonds and cranberries in by hand because it was so sticky, but was fine shaping the logs with wet hands as recipe suggested.  Only gave it 4 stars because it was a super pain to cut, most of them fell apart, got probably 1 loaf of nicely formed slices out of the 2 loafs.  I tried a few different knifes, ended up using a thin serrated one and very gently sawed the pieced off. Tried some other reviewers' suggestions of just pressing down, but didn't work. I think if I cooked the loafs a little longer and left it to cool for longer, so that the loaf is stiffer it'll work better.  Also the thick 3/4" slices seems a little fat for me, so I made some that were about 1 cm thick.  And I think there are too many nuts to cookie ratio, I think next time I might use 3/4-1c nuts and will definitely try it with pistachios.

I really enjoyed this cookie.  We have a recipe, where we put the batter all into a 13x9 pan.  When its done baking, cut it lengthwise and then cut across.  Much easier than making 2 loafs.  I didn't even attempt that part.  About 45 minutes in baking for the big loaf.  Also, I omitted 1/2 ts of the vanilla for about 1/2 ts of anise.  The pistachios (which I love) were a bit too much.  I'll probably add less and chop them and add a few more cranberries.  Other than those changes, it is a fantabulous recipe!

delicious-- the recipe was very forgiving, I underbaked the biscotti and put the logs back in the oven later on, and they still turned out beautifully. definitely dip hands in cold water to work with the sticky dough, and be careful when cutting so the biscotti does not crumble. I pressed down when cutting instead of sawing as another reviewer suggested, and I didn't have a problem with crumbling. This looks absolutely beautiful when it's finished. I dipped one side in dark chocolate-- perfect for Christmas! Great recipe!!

Great recipe. Even better w/ some of the mentioned modifications.  I also recommend the orange zest. I did the zest of 1 med orange. It was a generous Tablespoon. Also recommend increasing the cranberries. I did  a full cup.

Love this biscotti recipe so easy to make.  I used Canola oil since that is all I had on hand and they turned out great.   Will be taking them to Granny's for Christmas.

Amazing recipe! Thank you so much. Very simple to make....the "wet your hands" trick works great. I will add this to my "must make for Christmas" list. I liked the recipe just as it's written

This was the first time for making Biscotti. I found the recipe to be rather simple. I did add more almond extract for more of "that" flavor. I also added more Cranberries and instead of pistachio i did almonds. It is rather sticky like people said it would be. I was prepared for that. Only thing i found was i wasn't able to make 2 separate loaves. i only had one loaf that was around the same measurements as what the recipe indicated. Not sure if the piece were supposed to be really tiny. I am happy with the size of mine. Granted i only got about 10 slices. Another issue i found is the temp and time. First round i had to put it in for another 15 mins for it to be slightly brown. and the 2nd round i had to put it in for at least another 30mins. My oven was set to the right temp as well. But all in all... i think i will definitely make this again. :)

I had brazil nuts and used them and turned out great. Next time I would add 1/2 cup more cranberries because I like the tangy in every bite. Great recipe, thanks.

These were so easy to make and very tasty.  I made them exactly as directed and found they need an additional 3 minutes when in the log shape and an extra 2 minutes to harden in the oven.  I might drizzle a little dark chocolate over them once cooled. Will be giving these out in our Christmas goodie baskets.

Delicious!  I've made two batches, with and without the pistachios.  The only thing I changed was omit the almond extract and add about 2 teaspoons of grated orange rind.  This is the first biscotti recipe I've seen and tried that uses olive oil rather than butter.  By far the best biscotti recipe I've tried. (Tip-let loaf cool a bit before slicing and don't use a serrated knife or it'll crumble.  I use my very sharp Santoku for perfectly thin slices every time)

This is a great biscotti recipe.  I've made it as it, but also substituted mini chocolate chips for the cranberries and slivered almonds for the pistachio.  It's just a wonderful base recipe to try all sorts of combinations.  It comes out great everytime.  Tip: Increase oven temp to 325, but leave  cooking time the same.  Keep the same temperature when baking the sliced pieces.  Also, allow the logs to cool on wire racks about 30 minutes before slicing with a serrated knife and they never crumble.

I started out very skeptical with this recipes. I have tried quite a few biscotti recipes, but they never held their shape quite right, ended up browning too much or had a wooden,unappetizing look. 
With this recipe, I played it safe and omitted the nuts. I have to say this does make a lot of difference in how the biscotti shape up. I had no problem cutting the logs into slices.Very few crumbs!
I am also not a big fan of almond essence and didn't have any on hand anyways, so I omitted it.
I replaced the almond essence with a few drops of orange oil.... and WOW!The flavor was unbelievable. 
This was part of my menu of Christmas goodies and everyone loved them!! Definitely my favorite biscotti so far.
 
As far as the dough goes, it does tend to get very sticky. I greased my hands with olive oil instead of water to handle the dough. Shaping the dough was a piece of cake. I think this helped give the biscotti a lovely light golden color.
Also, the parchment paper helps evenly brown the biscotti.So as far as possible avoid using bare cookie sheets, foil lined sheets or silicone mats.
If it were not for the omissions,I would have given the recipe a 5. I can't wait to try this recipe with new fruits and flavors

Great! They look and taste great! I have subbed nuts and fruit for  1 1/2c. chopped praline coated pecans, and 1/2c. butterscotch chips. I have also subbed toasted almonds, white mini-chips and    chopped espresso beans! SO good! Endless possibilities! They will spread out quite a bit, so keep width narrow (2 inches MAX) also WET hands or you won't be able to work at all with dough. Make sure pan is well greased for the pecan variety or they will stick and break.  Good luck! :)

Great recipe. Thanks! Baked the first time and incorporated all the useful comments from others, e.g. dough was super sticky! It helped cos I had all the dough on my fingers! The dough won't stay in shape so the 2nd time round I just spoon them onto the parchment sheet with enough space for expansion and still get the shape required.  It is not necessary to mix the nuts with hands.  I used a wooden spoon to do the job.  Cleaner and more hygienic.  I reduced the nuts to 1 cup and had them chopped for easier slicing as advised by another. The almond extract was overpowering so I reduced it by half at 2nd attempt.  Extend the 2nd baking time as the biscotti was still soft even after using the full 10 mins according to the recipe.  Overall there was not enough for everyone and have been told that this would become a favourite now and everyone is waiting for my next baking! I packed some for my colleague's daughter who is 10 yrs old and she said it's better than her gradma's and asked for more next time! What a great compliment!  Thanks again!

These are one of my favourite cookies and won't stay around for a long time while I'm nearby since I can't stop eating them.  The cranberries were excellent with the pistachios, though it could have used more cranberries.  The colours are perfect for Christmas.  Nothing but good comments for these cookies.

My first time making biscotti and I was so pleased with the results. I didn't bake them quite as long to dry them out because my husband doesn't enjoy overly crunchy cookies. I baked them for about 10 minutes after they were sliced and they turned out to be crunchy but not in a way that cuts the roof of your mouth when you bite into it.

sticky! Yes, the dough was sticky.  Almost glue like.  i had to use a spatula to form it.  it flattened a bit in the oven but basically kept its shape.  started to rise after 20 mins.   if this happens to you don't worry. its a great cookie.  Just STICK with it.

Good. But I sub'd orange extract for almond and I think I may have over done it so they had an almost bitter/bite quality that I know came from the orange extract. None the less they were good.

Very tasty, and not difficult to make!  I substituted toasted blanched almonds that I chopped up for the pistachios, as I couldn't find shelled pistachios and didn't want to mangle my fingers shelling them.  I might try dipping one end of the cookies in white chocolate next time.

Was looking for the best biscotti recipe to make for my aunt for Christmas. This is no doubt the easiest and tastiest. I used pecans instead of pistachio. I also dipped them in white chocolate like I read in another review. These were yummy!

Very good biscotti. Good as is. although I personally would reduce the sugar to 1/2 c. next time because I like it less sweet - purely personal preference.

Yum Yum Yum! It was awesome the first time around! Make sure you use LIGHT olive oil. The regular stuff has an odd taste that does translate to the end result! NOt terrible though. The second batch I added 1/4 cup of ground almonds in place of 1/4 flour to increase the almod taste. Will keep on making - it was very flavourful!

This is an awesome recipe. It makes the BEST biscotti and you can pretty much modify it however you wish if you keep the base recipe the same. I've added chocolate chips and coconut, almonds and apricot, etc. The only problem I've ever encountered was when I tried to incorporate cocoa powder, but that will just need some more experimenting. I will say that this recipe was frustrating because it was SO sticky and messy. I fixed that problem, though. I do not wet my hands when I try to form the logs. Instead, I spray a sheet of parchment paper with cooking spray and scoop half of the batter onto it. Then, I can just use the parchment paper to shape it easily and it rolls right off onto the baking sheet (that is also lined with parchment paper).

I took these biscotti to work and they went like hot cakes. Everyone loved them! The batter is super sticky. To help this, I put the batter in a fridge for a few minutes before I tried to handle it. I also wet my hands with water before I molded the loaves. I sliced my first loaf while it was too warm and it crumbled a bit.Make sure you wait at least 15 minutes before you try to slice the loaves. Use a very sharp knife and push... don't saw! MOST IMPORTANT.... double or even triple the recipe! These little guys go fast and they freeze well. I loved this recipe and will be making again real soon!

I love this recipe but I find that a couple of modifications make it easier and tastier.  I use an extra egg yolk and orange flavoring instead of almond in the dough.  The extra egg yolk makes the cookies less likely to crumble when you slice them and the orange flavor seem to complement the cranberries better.  I also glaze the logs with the left-over egg white and sprinkle with sugar if I don't have a use for the egg white.

These are absolutely delicious.  I had never made biscotti before and they turned out perfectly.  The only thing I did differently after taking the logs out of the oven the first time was to bake the sliced biscotti for 8 minutes or so on each side.  Delicious, professional quality!  Perfect for gifts!

Excellent base recipe, I sub organic wholewheat flour and brown sugar and it came out beautifully. I also use extra virgin olive oil as I love the taste. I use this as my base biscotti recipe and have tried all different flavor combos: chocolate chip, almond, cashew, raisin etc..

Great Biscotti cookies,easy to make,friends and family loved them.I recommend coarsely chopping both the pistachios and dried cranberries. I also added fresh orange zest of 1 orange per recipe. Remember to ommitt the salt if your nuts are salted.I doubled the recipe also to get the "36" servings/cookies it said it would make. Cold wet hand tip helps a great deal. I drizzled tinted two colors {red and green} glaze over the tops of the cooled cookies to make the more Christmas looking." glaze made of milk and powder sugar { 1 cup of powder sugar, milk to make the smooth consistancy, But i added 1 tablespoon of meringue powder so the glaze would hardern and stack without smearing.I will definately make these over and over and over.Yummmyyyy.............

Kudos for this recipe. The best! After making several batches a friend showed me the secret to not getting your hands sticky with the dough--spoon mixture in a zip-lock bag and cut a shall corner out of the end of the bag (easier than a pastry bag) - just squeeze out in a thin line on the parchment and it makes perfect size biscotti.  This is definitely a keeper.  Never made biscotti before and it couldn't have been better -- much better than store-bought!  Thanks to Ginger for sharing.

Fabulous biscotti recipe.  Not crumbly like many recipes.  Making them with oil vs. butter makes them more "authentic."  Very pretty on a Christmas cookie tray.

Best basic biscotti recipe ever.  I have switched up the added ingredients many ways and it comes out perfect every time.  I have used yellow raisins and lemon, chocolate covered plum pieces, cranberries and almonds and have cherry pecan logs baking right now.  Best tip ever? Use a pizza cutter to slice the warm logs into bars. Cuts clean every time!

I made two batches of these, one as written, one without any almond extract, since no one in my family is crazy about almond extract.  I also swapped the nuts and cranberries for chocolate chips, at my sister's request.  This recipe is awesome!  The biscotti came out exactly the way I hoped.  I followed Suzanne's suggestion and covered the loaves with a  dishtowel while hey cooled, and they did not crack on top at all.  For the second batch, I formed one big rectangle on the cookie sheet, so that I could cut long cookies instead of small ones.  The long ones look really pretty.  I used a knife to cut them, then switched to a pizza cutter halfway through.  The pizza cutter made for much prettier cookies.  I'll definitely use a pizza cutter next time.  I can't wait to make these again!

Delicious! I used a piece of plastic wrap over the log to shape it before baking. Worked well and allowed me to fidget with the shape without getting my hands sticky.

I can't tell you all just how much I love these!
I've made them many times and are a hit with my family and friends.
They come out perfect every time.
One thing I do is that once they've been cut into slices, I cook them for about 10 mins each side, making them very crunchy, just like we Italians like them!

EXCELLENT. The recipes I've tried in the past resulted in very dry & hard cookies. These are awesome! I wanted an almond cookie with almond pieces, so I followed the recipe and added fresh chopped almonds and a few dried cherries. This will be my one and only biscotti recipe.

Exactly how biscotti should taste! I made these as gifts for Christmas for my Italian family and everyone loved them! I made 3 different kinds: the cranberry/pistachio from the recipe, triple chocolate, and almond. To modify for the triple chocolate: I used about 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa and cut the sugar down to 2/3 cup, added 1 1/2 cup chocolate chips, and then dipped one side of the cooled biscotti in melted Hershey's chocolate. For the almond: I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of almond extract and only 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and added 1 1/2 cups of sliced almonds. I read in one of the reviews that covering the biscotti logs right after taking them out of the oven will prevent cracking, it really does make a difference. I used a clean dish towel, but parchment paper works just fine. Enjoy! :)

Delicious! I let the biscotti loaves cool in the oven after I turned it off. This will avoid any cracking of the biscotti, since it gives them a chance to cool slowly. They came out perfectly- no crumbling or cracking. This recipe is a keeper!

I will make this recipe again.  I did make a few minor alterations (half recipe): instead of almond extract, I used vanilla extract; I chopped the nuts, I used vegetable oil instead of olive oil; I did not add the salt because the pistachios were salted; and I used about 1/2 cup of dried cranberries.

This is a simple biscotti recipe that you can alter in many ways.   For the cranberry, I used walnuts and added some orange flavoring intead of vanilla.  I also made chocolate biscotti by adding some Hershey cocoa and chocolate chips and using a little less flour.   I like this recipe because the biscotti is a little softer when done.

Excellent recipe!! Very tastey....although I did make one minor adjustment. I didn't have pistachios so I used some leftover almond/walnut mixture tossed with cinnamon I had from making Baklava. It was incrediable!!! I will make again. I also tried this recipe with a few changes to modify the taste. I omitted the olive oil, almond extract, cranberries and nuts. I added veg.oil, peppermint extract and chocolate chips....delicious!!!!!

I have been making this recipe for quite some time and was asked if I could make a healthier version. As other reviews suggested, I substituted the butter for the olive oil.  I also decreased the sugar by 3 TBSP.  I used 1 cup of white flour, 1/2 cup of wholewheat and 1/4 cup of ground flax seed (you can easily ground this in your coffee grinder).  Then for added ingredients I use chopped pistachios, dried cranberries, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, flax seeds and a small amount of chopped white chocolate (total amount of all the ingredients 2 cups however you want to divide it up).  I also added 1 TBSP orange zest to the sugar and butter mixture. I brushed egg yolk and water mixture on the dough and sprinkled extra seeds before baking. These were so yummy and filling.

I don't normally like biscotti, but this one is awesome.  I love the chewy cranberries with the crunchy, salty pistachios.  Not sure how long they've been around, but I found already shelled pistachios in the store, which made this recipe much easier.  Drizzled with some melted white chocolate, dipped in some chai tea, yum!

Took others advice & used orange extract instead of the almond, but next time I'll use the almond.  We didn't like them at first, but after sitting over night they were better.  Do double the cranberries.  Will make this again & then decide if we're keeping.

THANK YOU! These were excellent, and I can't wait to make again with various add-ins. I was nervous because the batter looked sticky at first, almost like a super-thick brownie batter, and I didn't know how the loaves would keep their shapes on an open pan, but they held together well through baking, slicing and rebaking. Yum!!

This was my first attempt at making biscotti and it came out awesome!  I used slivered almonds instead of pistachios.  I wanted to make something different for the cookie exchange at work.  I dipped half of it in chocolate.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used slivered almonds instead of pistachios and I added some fresh orange zest to the batter before baking.... AWESOME!!!  The best biscotti I have EVER tasted, really wonderful!  I will definitely be doing these again.  I think they would look wonderful drizzled with white or dark chocolate, so I'll try that next time.  These would make an excellent little goodie to tie up in little cellophane bags with some ribbon for the holidays!

Wonderful! First time making biscotti and the result was perfect! I didn't have pistachios so I substituted walnuts and also added 1 T orange zest. I was surprised at how sticky and thick the dough was but using cold water to wet your hands first worked well. After cutting and baking them for the second time, I drizzled on a glaze of melted white chocolate chips, a splash or orange juice, and more orange zest. Just wonderful!

This recipe is absolutely amazing!  I couldn't find unsalted pistachios so I added an extra cup of cranberries and orange zest and drizzled with white chocolate.  I did have to increase the first baking time by 5 minutes.  I am off to try another variation!

Very good.  I didn't have light Olive oil so used regular Canola oil per another reviewers suggestion.  I doubled the recipe to make a larger batch and baked longer both times.  I bake mine on Pampered Chef stones, it eliminates turning the biscotti on the 2nd bake.  Definatley use parchment paper and wet your hands.  I also chopped the pistachios.

Just made these cookies today and loved them!  I used a little more dried cranberries than the recipe called for because I really like cranberries.  Hints:  The batter will be sticky, don't panic, they cook just fine.  I was a little nervous because they didn't look like any biscotti I had cooked before.  I made two "loafs" as described, but there is no way these were going to make 12x2 loaves.  Mine were more like 7 inches long and about 3 inches wide. Let them cool so that they are not hot to the touch when you cut them, and use a very sharp serated knife, so you can cut through the nuts. If the loaf is to hot the cookies will break, or the nuts and cranberries will fall out. Use gentle easy sawing strokes when you cut.  I flipped the cookies over half way through the second baking cycle so they would be good and cruncy.  Once they cooled from their second bake, I dipped the flat portion of the cookies in semi-sweet chocolate.  Yum.  Love the crunch of the cookie and chewyness of the cranberries.  Thanks for a new favorite holiday recipe!

These biscotti are, quite frankly, not worth their stars.  We did not enjoy them.  I can recommend Cantucci Biscotti from allrecipies... more flavour, no oil.

This biscotti turned out great, but next time I'll use less pistachios (it was chock full!). I've shared the recipe and will definitely make again.

I doubled-up this recipe and made loads to give away. They're great and others liked them as well. Not too sweet tasting and the almond extract is a must. The only problem I encountered is that I suspected recipe asks for too much pistacchio so I used waaaay less and they came out chock full o' dem.

5 STARS!  5 STARS!  5 STARS!  These were so good!  I made them on a whim on the night before a family gathering.  Boy were they delicious!  Everyone loved them.  If you use a serrated knife, they are not too hard to slice.  But, even the ones that crumbled were delicious (more for me!).  I will be making these again and again. :-)

Mmmmm...these were a hit last year, and I'm going to make them again.  Definitely buy pre-shelled pistachios.  It's far too time consuming to try to shell them yourself.

First biscotti recipe I've tried and it's definitely a keeper. The biscotti was crunchy but not hard. The amount of sugar used was perfect and not too sweet. I used vegetable oil instead of light olive oil. Also reduced the pistachio to about 1 cup. I recommend toasting the nuts for more flavour. I made the logs 12 x 2 inches as per recipe. They will spread and puff up. The dough was sticky and the tip to wet hands when handling the dough definitely helps.

Love this recipe!   Tip - if you want to make these ahead, completely cool the logs after step 4, wrap and freeze.   Makes for a clean cut for step 5, and you can have just basked cookies on the spur of the moment.

The only thing I could add to make this recipe better would be some 'orange peel'.  I love the combination of orange & cranberries, and with the pistachios (my favorite all time nut, if you know what I mean) this would be HEAVENLY.  Another thing is if you drizzle some frosting over add the combination of almond extract and orange juice into the frosting drizzle.  HEAVENLY.  I mean if you are going to have a sweet, why not go all out and do it RIGHT?

Loved the fact that this recipe used olive oil! Made no changes in this amazing recipe...they cook up beautifully and I find after the first bake, let cool completely and then I use a serated knife to slice the cookies before the second bake to crisp them up. My family loved them. I did also add about 1/2 c of white chocolate chips as well...otherwise, a perfect biscotti recipe.

I reduce the pistachio to 1 cup and keep the dried cranberry the same.  I jut thought 1.5 cups gave a cookie too dense in nuts.  I also add a couple of drops of green food coloring so that the green cookie shows the red dried cranberry better.  More festive at the holiday that way.  These cookies are amazing.

Is there something I can add to make the dough NOT so sticky? Maybe more flour or will that ruin the recipe? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Just waiting on oven to make my first batch..Keeping fingers toes even my eyes crossed hoping it will come out...Thanks..I left out cranberries and just just almonds. Also used anise instead of almond extract...that stuff ain't cheap...LOL...Have a good day everyone.

Absolutely, marvelously delicious. My husband ate a double batch of it before I could even give them to guests.
No need to change it at all, whacking the pistachios with a hammer will help them go farther since they are so expensive.  I have altered some things here and there based on other comment, orange extract, etc but really they are so delicious and aromatic just as they are.
Excellent holiday gifts put in cello holiday themed bags, the family was delighted.

PERFECTION!!!  BEST BISCOTTI!!! I made these just as printed but I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. Everyone loved them and you can change them up so many different ways. The dough is sticky but water on your hands helps that. Don't add more flour because it doesn't need it!

Very easy recipe.  IMHO could use more flavoring so I would add an extra tsp of almond or next time would like to try anise.  I unfortunately over baked and they came out a little harder than I wanted.  Didn't realize they would harden as they set.  I will make again but will pay more attention to the baking time.  Also, used extra virgin olive oil because that is what I had.  Not sure if that is equal to Light Olive Oil, but it worked.  Thanks...

Amazing recipe. They come out perfect every time.  Instead of olive oil, try olive oil margarine.  It blends better and cookies taste exactly the same.

This is great recipe, which I have use for years, but today I used Splenda instead of sugar and that was an epic failure.  The dough was so dry it would even mix.

I make another batch using sugar and there was no problem.  Splenda does not work in this recipe!!!

This was my first try making biscotti and I must say, this is a wonderful and simple recipe!!! It is so tasty! I do recommend using slightly wet hands when shaping the dough as it is a very sticky dough. Enjoy:)

I made biscotti for the first time this Saturday and as a novice, I was worried because the dough seemed stickier than I expected and my "logs" looked more like fish and amoeba.  Even still the resultant cookies were Perfect!  Suggestions, make sure you buy your pistachios shelled as doing it by hand took me an hour and a half :)   Also don't wait more than the 10 minutes to cut into slices as it may start to crumble as you cut into it.  Can't wait to make more.

Where do i start?? This is an amazing recipe and i will DEFINITELY be using it again. I wanted to make them so much but had neither pistachio's or cranberries so substituted chocolate chips and flaked almonds. It seems like its quite a robust recipe as they are absolutely gorgeous, despite my changes. I too drizzled with a little icing and they were fab. Thanks so much for this recipe.

OK....these are great biscotti! I had no problem at all shaping or cutting them by following the directions exactly. The only time consuming part was shelling all the pistachios! Do cut them thin as the directions specify. Oh, and make sure to use LIGHT olive oil (as specified) for best taste!

Yum.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for decreasing the pistachios to about 1.25 cups (the shelling got tedious) and made a corresponding increase in cranberries to about 0.75 cups.  Used a bench scraper to cut the individual biscotti, which worked perfectly.  I did have to leave them in the oven on the second bake for about 18 minutes, as they didn't seem to be drying, but they probably would have been fine air-drying if I'd taken them out a little earlier.

Fantastic and Easy!  I added 2 tsp baking powder by mistake and it was fine.  Also used Almonds instead of pistachio's only because it was what I had on hand.  Love it - tested it out on people at work and it was a hit.  Adding it to my Holiday Baking list for sure!

I cannot in good faith give this 5 stars.  sure, the flavor is good with some additions, but that is about all.  The dough is a sticky mess!  I had to shape it on waxed paper, then place it on the parchment and peel off the waxed paper.  This resulted in a lot of wasted dough.  Using whole pistachios is another mistake.  When you go to cut the cooked dough, the whole pistachios breaks the dough apart.  I added extra almond flavoring and orange zest.  Without this, you have a very dry, dull and bland biscotti.  I won't make this again.  What a disappointment.  I will stick with Emirel's recipe from the food network that I tried a week prior.  Excellent results!

I made this once again yesterday...it is to die for.  I have never in my life had so many compliments on something I have baked.  I was told by an older gentleman that it is the best biscotti he has ever tasted.  That says alot - he is from Jersey.  I was also told a local restaurant sells biscotti at $2.50 per slice.  This gentleman thought mine was far better.  You have to try it!  It is wonderful dipped in coffee.

This is a great, crunchy biscotti.  I made it with just over a cup of pistachios, which was plenty, and dried cherries rather than cranberries.  On the second baking I turned them over after 8 minutes and baked them another 8 minutes as many biscotti recipes recommend, but this probably wasn't necessary, because as I said, they were crunchy and perfect!  Thanks for posting this recipe, I'll be making various versions of this often!

This is an excellent tasting, less fattening recipe. I sub the pistachios with roasted, lightly salted almonds and they are wonderful! Highly recommended.

Wow....this has to be the best biscotti I have ever had.  It was my first time making biscotti and it was actually quite easy.  The word biscotti makes it intimidating, but I had no problems.  I would highly recommend that everyone give this a try, you won't be disappointed.

Excellent. I also melted some white chocolate and dark chocolate and drizzled this over the top of some. It is not necessary as they are delicious on their own but it looked pretty and I never say no to chocolate!

Great recipe, especially nice for the holidays with the green & red colors. Living in Michigan, I used dried cherries in place of the cranberries. I also baked mine a few minutes longer for the second bake as I didn't think they were dry enough. Once cooled I drizzled on melted white chocolate for a "festive" look. I will DEFINITELY make these again and think the people in my cookie exchange will really enjoy them.

I LOVED this recipe!  I added 2 tsp orange zest, used EVOO (that's all I had in the pantry!) and you could taste the EVOO, which is different, but it was so good!  I also added the wet paper towel on top as the biscotti was cooling before the second bake -- I was AMAZED at how easy it was to slice it without everything falling apart.  I would add more cranberries, and less pistachios next time.

I just made this recipe following the advice of previous reviewers. I'm glad I only used one cup of pistachios and one cup of cranberries, more than that would have been too much. I used canola oil instead of light olive oil (didn't have any) and the flavor is fine. I chilled the dough before shaping it so it was very easy to shape and made sure to press down the knife to cut the loaves instead of sawing back and forth. This recipe is really easy to make and doesn't use up a lot of pots and pans which I love. I mixed all the ingredients by hand.  I shaped the loaves in 12x2 inches and ended up with 24 biscotti. I could have made it into more if I had cut the slices thinner but I prefer it thicker.  The taste of the biscotti itself is lightly sweet which is perfect for me. I love something to nibble on with my afternoon tea. For my kids and friends who like things sweeter I drizzled melted dark chocolate in zig zags over the biscotti.  Next time I make it I will dip half the biscotti in melted chocolate.  Oh and this is a very kid friendly recipe because it's almost foolproof and doesn't require any fancy techniques to prepare. My kids had fun helping out.

This recipe is wonderful! I use sliced almonds instead of pistachios and used orange extract instead of almond. I also brush the top of the loaf with egg white about 10 mins. before it's done. This makes it shiny and prevents cracking. You can also sprinkle sugar over the egg white for a very finished look. I've made it many times and it always turns out great. I assume that it keeps well, but it never stays around long in my house!

This is a great Biscotti recipe! Just the right amounts of cranberry and pistachio. I shorten the second baking time by a minute or so for a softer biscotti.

This is a great recipe for biscotti! I was looking for a pistachio biscotti recipe and found this - I used 2 cups of pistachio and no cranberries. I also used white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, and these turned out great.  Just FYI, as others have mentioned these spread rather than puff up, so if you want a taller cookie make sure you shape your log a little taller and slimmer.  Will be making again!

Great recipe.  I make alot of biscotti, and I believe 300 is the best oven temp to use.
I have also used recipe as base and changed the add-ins with much success.

These are DELICIOUS!!!

My fussy kids ate these!! I'm so impressed with how easy they are to make. They didn't take that long either. 

I cut diagonally, so my biscotti were long lengths. I cut them into .5 inch strips and they turned out beautifully after the second bake.

I made a couple of very minor changes to the recipe.  I used 1 cup of dried cranberries and 1 cup of pistachios.  I also refrigerated the dough for a couple of hours and it was much easier to handle.  If you decide to refrigerate the dough be sure to increase the baking time.  Fantastic.  A real hit.  Several friends asked for the recipe and were even inspired to try their hand at biscotti baking.

I hasve been making this recipe for years.  I followed some suggestions in the reviews and used 1 cup of whole pistacios and 1 cup of dried cranberries.  I also baked them on a silpat sheet instead of parchment. I make the batter into 3 logs  about 2x10(across the silpat) for slightly smaller Biscotti. For the second bake I stand them up instead of on their sides.  Since the dough is a little sticky I just spooned it out of the bowl with a rubber scraper into the shape of a log on the silpat.

Very good. I omitted the amond extract, added orange zest, substituted the pistachios with sliced almonds (1 cup) and used 1 cup of orange flavored dried cranberries. I couldn't get enough of these!

I read other reviews that suggest modifications.  I would maybe decrease the pistachios to 1cup, but otherwise it's great.  Don't chop the pistachios, otherwise you won't get the beautiful cross sections, and for those who had crumbling while cutting, you probably didn't cool for the exact 10min (set your oven timer because the right amount of time makes a difference!).

Wow this is REALLY delicious!  I love cranberries and pistachios are my second favorite nuts! (after cashews of course) I noticed the review of one person concerned about the runny dough.  Well I solved it by making aluminum foil boats lined with wax paper that held the dough in.  As the biscotti baked, it pused the foil away so that it could attain the half moon shape.  Being an engineering major, it was interesting problem to solve!  But again, super recipe.

These were the best.  I am making my second batch in two days.  I used 1/2 cranberries and 1/2 pistachios and it was perfect.  I cant wait to try them with variations on additions.  Great colors for Christmas.

Have made 3 batches of this just this week and I can hardly keep it around!  I would recommend putting on an eggwash to get a glossy finish though.  YUMMY!!

These are AMAZING!  I've been making them for months now and everytime I make a batch it vanishes instantly and friends are all asking for the recipe.  I've tried some slight variations to it -- 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4, and 1/3 cup of white chocolate chips mixed into the dough.  Dried cherries work really well too instead of the cranberries (I also increased the amount of cranberries or cherries I put in like other people to a little over a 1/3 cup).  And then I coat the cookies afterwards with some dark chocolate.  Everyone loves them!

I have made many biscotti recipes but this was the best one to date.  Easy to make, good consistency and taste delicious.  Made it with almonds (toasted them first).  It's a keeper!!

These are most excellent.  Make sure you cook them long enough the first time or they wont have that wonderful crunch.  I like to add candied ginger as well.  A great holiday treat at parties or to give as a gift.

This recipe is SO good! Biscotti is my dad's favorite cookie so I had to find a good recipe for breakfast and this turned out to be way better than I expected. It's slightly sweet and has the perfect texture. It's also not too hard, so it can be eaten without dipping it in coffee. The dough was very sticky and I didn't have any parchment paper, so I was terrified that it would stick to the pan, but it came right off after baking (all I did was spray nonstick spray)! I didn't have pistachio nuts so I subbed a mix of crushed almonds/ pistachios instead, and I didn't have olive oil so I had to sub vegetable oil! Nevertheless, these came out so divine! I can't wait to try more flavors.

These are mouth-wateringly delicious and so pretty to look at too! I followed the advise of the other reviewers and chopped the pistachios before adding them in (after chopping, the pistachios measured approx 1 cup). I also mildly chopped the cranberries to prevent them from chunking up in the dough (after chopping the cranberries measure 1 cup). The dough, is very very sticky so do keep dunking your hands in cold water when working with it. I didn't quite get 3 dozen but that's just my fault coz my logs weren't long enough and my slices a bit too thick. I did make 2 amendments to the recipe : I cut the sugar to 3-4 tablespoons (coz the dried cranberries I had were quite sweet), skipped adding almond extract and instead added 2 tablespoons of bitter orange marmalade. I do think it could do with more tang from orange zest so I'm going to add more in the next time I make these. I didn't drizzle with melted chocolate coz these were so great as is and I didn't to overpower the lovely shades of green, red and purple on the biscotti. Thanks for the recipe Gerry. And thank you so much all you great people who are thoughtful enough to leave your reviews! :)

Fantastic recipe. I didn't have light olive oil so I used vegetable oil and they came out delicious. They look like they came from the bakery! Make sure to wet your hands when forming the logs and use a sharp knife to cut the slices. I cut straight down (no sawing motion) and got perfect non crumbly slices. Easy to make. Will make again for sure!

They came out great! I substituted slivered almonds for the pistachios. It's the first time I made biscottis. The dough is real gooey to work with, however they sure are tasty. Especially with an expresso after lunch.

I used dried hibiscus flowers (or jamaica at your local Mexican grocery store) instead of cranberries. And I used almonds that I toasted and chopped just before adding to the batter. I also added zest from one orange (about 1 tbsp), and the juice from half that orange. Overall, I think this is a very versatile recipe. However, it is on the sweeter side for biscotti. It worked well with whole grain flour, just make sure you either use pastry flour or white so it's not gritty. The "white" whole grain is made from a softer wheat.

Absolutely great recipe.  I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it.  I love that there is no butter in it.  It tastes better the next day.  Not too sweet -- really allows the pistachios and cranberries to shine.  I added extra cranberries.

These are delicious! They are just perfect - love the flavor, extra crunch from the pistachios and chewiness of the cranberries. I gave these out at Christmas and received wonderful compliments from everyone. They were the first cookies to be gobbled up at home, too. Found them relatively easy to make and they turned out exactly as I expected. They do tend to get softer if packed in plastic bags. Tupperware works fine, probably paper bags would work well , too.

This recipe has given me consistently wonderful results every time.  I have made pistachio cranberry, cherry almond, and blueberry almond.  They make wonderful gifts!  I do usually reduce the vanilla to 1 1/2 t and increase the almond to 1 t to enhance the nuttiness.  Definitely follow the tips about cooling before slicing with a non-serrated blade.

Love this recipe.  Cooled them for longer than 10 minutes.  Found that biscotti is easier to cut that way.  The second part of baking took longer than 8-10 minutes but I'm sure that depends on oven too.   I dipped them in white chocolate and they were given as Christmas gifts.

OMG, these are going to be my favorite cookie.  Delicious. They are 1000x's better than what I have bought at a store before.  Very easy to make. 

 I did use some of the suggestions that I read on the reviews.  1--wet my hands while shaping the dough onto the cookie sheet. 2-- finely chopped the nuts. 3--brushed the log with egg.  4--wrapped the log in 2 towels to cool for 10 minutes before cutting into strips.

I had to add about an extra TBL of flour (maybe because of damp weather) to the mixture.  I did not have parchment paper, so used a silicone sheet.   After cutting the log into strips and cooking them additional 10 minutes, I flipped the strips over and left them in the oven(turned off) for an additional 5 minutes.

I definitely will make these again.

CHRISTMAS COOKIE FEST 2011 - Very good. I did leave the biscotti undecorated to show more of the green and red seasonal colors.

We love this biscotti the best.  The only change I make is to use 1 cup each of cranberries and pistachios.  I think as written, it would be too many nuts for us.

Excellent!  I was skeptical when the dough came out real sticky but I trusted the recipe and glad I did.  I substituted dried sour cherries...oh my goodness!!  I love the sweet, tart and salty combination!

too good- I have to make them again because they have disappeared before they could make it to my cookie trays!!!! I used  slivered almonds because that's what I had on hand. I also add more of the dried cranberries and chop them a little and add a bit of the  almond extract.

A perfect cookie!  Only change was I used hazelnuts in place of the pistachios.  (needed using up!) Next batch will try the pistachios.  Lots of combination possibilities with this cookie!  Do try it for yourself - it is easy and delicious.

This is a really good, easy biscotti.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time, except I dipped the biscotti in white chocolate.  I added less pistachios and more cranberries the second time (just personal preference) and it is great that way too.  Both my husband and my oldest son really like this one (to my chagrin-it was for me!) and they don't care for biscotti.

Made these cookies today. Was looking for a recipe that did not use butter. These are the best biscotti I ever made.  Next time will add some orange ring.  Used 1 tspb of almond extract instead of 1/2 and it was perfect. Did not add cranberries

My husband who is not a big biscotti fan loves these.  I didn't have pistachios so I used slivered almonds.  These are nothing short of fantastic!

So beautiful and delicious. I liked how they were softer than the typical biscotti from a coffee shop. I tried a white chocolate drizzle as another reviewer suggested and that was nice too. 

The only downfall to these is that it took me nearly 2 hours to shell the pistachios!

Holy moly... these are sooo good! I made mine with slivered almonds and white whole wheat flour. They stay a little bit soft even if you leave them about ten minutes more after cutting than the recipe calls for (which I would recommend). Brought them out for Thanksgiving and they were a big hit. Makes for a nice whole grain side with a salad and leftover turkey.

I made this exactly as written except I chopped the pistachios a bit. There was altogether too much cranberry and pistachio in this recipe. The biscotti actually were unattactive. The dough itself was bland and dry--even for biscotti.

This was my first attempt at biscotti. I have tasted many and these are definitely one of the best! I purchased a bag of chopped pistachios since my husband loves all things pistachio, and searched on the site...so for all those complaining about whole pistachios, there are options...
Also, great tip about wetting hands! Had no problems with sticky dough. Will definitely be making again. Thanks for recipe!!

My husband and I first made this recipe about 4 years ago for his brother-in-law.  We get requests for it each year and the list grows because more people want it each year.  This is so festive looking and so delicious.  We follow the recipe as it is written and love it.

Wow!  These are sooo good!  I used slivered almond instead of pistachios and equal sugar substitute instead of real sugar.  Baked 45 minutes, cool about 10 minutes with a dish towel on top, baked again for 10 minutes as directed.  Came out beautifully and taste so good!  Will definitely make again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made these today, first time I had biscotti, so I'm not to sure on how they are supposed to taste. However I'm sure I absolutely love these. I would no longer eat store bought cookies and biscuits. This recipe is a keeper. 
I did make some changes to the recipe. I omitted the olive oil and almond extract.

Simple and very good recipe, I like that it's not crazy sweet, doesn't has any cream, but still good with tea , coffee like a weekly dessert. I'm doing second time for the last week today. This time I decided to make them with chopped dried apricots, raisins and peanuts.
Thank you!

This recipe was FANTASTIC! I usually dislike biscotti, but these are absolutely addicting, even for me.

I made two small changes simply because I didn't have the right ingredients: Instead of pistachios, I chopped up almonds and toasted them in the oven. I also didn't have light olive oil, so I used extra virgin olive oil for 1/3rd of the oil and canola oil for the remaining 2/3rds. And I still think they turned out PERFECTLY!

I actually think these are really good-- and SO easy ! They look lovely in a jar; as a gift. The only reason it didn't get 4 stars for me was because I was hoping it would be a bit crispier; I also didn't have any almond extract so that could be why it was more bland than I thought it would be. Overall though, an amazing recipe! I'm keeping this one in my booklet.

I was so skeptical when the dough was so loose and wet, but, the cool water on my hands worked well to shape the logs.  They spread on the sheets, but, once baked, turned out perfectly!  I love, love this recipe and can't wait to experiment with other flavors.  I'm thinking of trying to subsitute some of the flour for powdered baking chocolate.

Really good and easy to make!  I was really surprised I could make biscotti at home--delicious.  The only thing I am going to try differently next time is maybe add a little bit more almond extract- I like a little bit extra nutty flavor. Excellent Recipe!

Wow -- These are fantastic and so easy to make!  I could not find shelled pistachios, so I used walnuts and they turned out delicious.  When making the dough, as other have noted, the dough does not look right.  It looks almost like a thick muffin mix with too much fruit and nuts.  Be sure to have a bowl of cool water near by.  It really helps make the logs easy to form.  Will make again and again for sure!

YUM!  These were very easy to make and very delicious!  I did make a few alterations to them: 1. Used margarine because I didn't have any light olive oil. 2.  Added a tbsp of orange zest 3. Rolled cut edges in sugar before second baking. Wonderful flavor.  Next time will add chopped dried apricots.  I only got about 2 dozen cookies, not 3.

These were so great. I made many variations of these. Just substitute the fruit, extract and nuts. Coconut biscotti: use coconut, walnuts and coconut extract. Cherry almond biscotti: use dried cherries, almond extract and pecans. The possibilities are endless.

FANTASTIC...this was very easy and so tasty. I followed some other reviews and added 1/2 tsp. orange extract. I used 1 cup of  slivered almonds that I crushed by hand and 1 cup of cranberries which I chopped to make the biscotti easier to cut. Worked like a charm. I got 32 clean slices. The dough was sticky but I didn't touch it with my hands, instead I used a silicon spatula to shape it which worked really well. I will be making this again for sure.

This is a great basic biscotti recipe for mixing it around a bit.  I doubled the batter because I needed more to give them out as gifts.  I added 2 tsp. of vanilla extract and 2 tsp. of rum extract.  It added to the holiday flavor of cranberry and pistachios. I also made them 4" in height to fit perfectly in my holiday cookie boxes.  Very yummy, thank you.

Absolutely the best!  Perfect biscotti with a wonderful nutty flavor.  I tried it with a can of "Pistachio Lovers" Nut mix and it was great!  My dad said it was the best he'd ever had and he knows his biscotti!

Just the right sweetness and crunch. And so pretty. Increased cranberries and reduced pistachios as other reviewers suggested.Didn't chop up pistachios.Having your hands wet to shape dough is a MUST.Impossible otherwise!The dough flattens out while baking so make sure they are only 2 inches wide and have enough height, or you might end up with stumpy biscotti! Mine got pretty wide while baking, but luckily I make the logs high. The next time I'll try to make make 3 logs out of same quantity.

I've tried a few biscotti recipes, but this one is a keeper.  I used slivered almonds rather than pistachio . . . either one would be fine in a great cookie like this.

This was the first time I made Biscotti and it is so easy.  I used slivered almonds instead of Pistachios.  Other reviews stated that the dough is a bit sticky - avoid this by making sure you use a liquid measuring cup for the oil and  a dry measuring cup for the flour.  Also, the dough spreads a bit so make sure you give each log ample room on the cookie sheet. Enjoy!

These have been my standard Christmas cookie for a few years now, and I still get requests. The recipe written as is is perfectly delicous and everyone loves it, though for personal consumption I reduced the almond extract to 1/4 tsp because I'm not a huge fan of that flavor. I've made it again and here are a couple other hints: 1) refrigerate the dough for a bit to make it easier to handle. 2) wet your hands so you can handle the dough well. 3) Up the cranberries to 3/4 C and decrease the pistachios to 1C.

Oh my....these are AMAZING! I followed the recipe very closely. (I only added 1/2 t. of cinnamon and doubled the almond extract) I think the key is that you make the "logs" 2x12 inches and the bicotti are like small cookies. Cut them right out of the oven with a very sharp knife and they shouldn't crumble. I was able to get 24 cookies. I will be making another batch of these.

These are FANTASTIC! The only changes I made was to replace 1/4 of the white sugar with brown sugar (for a bit of a deeper flavor). I also cut the pistachios down to 1 cup & I thought this was perfect. This biscotti was light and sweet--and who wouldn't love that it's lowfat?! Everyone raved about these!

This will be my new standard recipe & I'll make variations on the add-ins! Yum!!!

Outstanding! My tip, as mentioned before is to have cold hands. My husband's tip is sprinkle the parchment paper with water before rolling; combined you get the most of your dough and easy, concise rolls.  I tend to give a little extra vanilla and just love this recipe.  Today we tried the base with slivered almonds, green cherries and cranberries and were thrilled with another happy outcome.  But don't forgo this version.  It's a winner.

These got rave reviews  from those that tried them.  I dipped half in white chocolate.  Also, my strategy for keeping the dough manageable is to spritz my hands with a canola or olive oil spray.

This recipe is FANTASTIC. I made biscotti for the first time and I'll have no reason to try another. For the 2nd baking, I recommend  doubling the time for a crunchier cookie. Don't bake more than that or the pistachios will look dark and not very pretty as did some of mine. They were still Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Two batches and they were gone in 10 mins!  I made these with orange flavored craisins and walnuts (pantry availables) and they were wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly except baked them a third time for an additional 10 mins at 275 as they came out too soft for my taste the first time.  Also the sticky dough did concern me but not to worry, it's all a science I suppose!  Thanks for a keeper.

This recipe is AWESOME!  I used 1 cup each of pistachios and dried cranberries and processed both items in the food processor.  The biscotti logs sliced beautifully, even though the dough was so wet I was sure I had done something wrong.  It works well to spoon the dough onto the cookie sheet in the shape of a log.  I will be trying all kinds of variations of fruits and nuts with the base recipe. Also delicious warm right out of the oven.

The taste is very good. The only thing is that when I went to cut it, it totally crumbled. I think I only got 2 good slices out of it. But it still tasted good. UPDATE: My second attempted turned out much better than the first. My dad requested these as a birthday gift, I was hesitant because of how my first batch came out. But I looked through the reviews, took some advice from other users and they turned out awesome! I added the zest of 1 large orange, didn't have baking powder so I sub. baking soda and cream of tarter. I also use orange flavored craisens instead of regular dried cranberries and drizzled them with white chocolate. I noticed that they cut alot better while they are still warm. I was told I definately will be making these again according to friends and family who tried this batch! Thanks!

Using light olive oil I have to give these 3 stars.The olive taste came through. Made with canola or butter I am sure these would earn the 5 atar rating. The pistachio,cranberry combined with the almond extract was very good. Dough was very easy to work with. I will make these again with a change in the oil.

Don't bother using your hands with this sticky dough.  Just use wooden spoon to scoop and make 2 long slender logs on the parchment.  You can flatten the logs with the spoon once you have the logs in place.  I used a medium olive oil, not light, and it came out great.  I also used dried cherries instead of cranberries and made white choc sqiggles on them when done. Very good.

very nice.  i didn't have parchment paper though and tried to put the loaves on a baking sheet.  they ran and spread out once in the oven.   i don't know if the parchment paper prevents this from happening, but you may not want to skip that step unless you do what i did:  i sprayed non-stick cooking spray on some loave pans and picked up the now "spread" dough (it had already started to bake on the outside) and put it in the loaf pans to where it was about 1 1/2" deep.  put the pans back in the oven and baked as instructed.  the "loaves" popped right out and where easy to slice.  though my biscotti had more of slightly 'square' shape, as opposed to the typical 'half-moon', it was beautiful, tasty and all-in-all, a success.  i melted some gharadelli white chocolate chips and made little squiggles on them.  they were beautiful.  hope this helps!

I Love biscotti and these were no exception.  I would suggest lightly toasting the nuts before adding them to the batter, especially if you substitute almonds for the pistachios. It enhances their flavor.

Excellent flavor and aroma. I used 3/4 cup less pistacio's, but I recommend you go with your liking. Also added a few drops of green food coloring for a more christmasy look. If you want your baked log to be an even light brown be sure to flip it over during the first 15 minutes of baking. This recipe is highly recommended by me and my large family. I can definetely say it will be a new Christmas tradition at our house.

This was easy and tastes great. I think it can also be dipped into dark chocolate  (on one end only) for a nicer, richer flavour. But it was nice as is too. It makes very little though (I halved the recipe to try it out)...so if you are making it for a large number of people you may want to double to recipe or you may end up having to bake another "batch". Thanks for the recipe though. This was my first time making biscotti and now I am anxious to try some of the other recipes on this site.

This recipe does not deserve a rating at all!  I can't understand how it can get such good ratings.  I followed exactly the steps but since I don't have cranberries on hand I omitted that and added pistachios only (I even used measuring cup and spoons).  The dough was so soft it cannot hold.  I had to put it in the loaf pan to hold it.  Even with slicing, the whole thing just crumbled.  Anyway, since it's been baked might as well eat it but it tasted too awful.  It's a waste of good ingredients, my time and efforts.  Will never bake  it again.

Terrific recipe.  It was easy, fast, and the flavors are great.  I might have liked more
cranberries, though I don't know if that would change the textures too much; maybe I
will try a bit more cranberries next time. But--this is a keeper!  The biscotti are great with
tea.

This recipe is awsome. I made them for a cookie exchange, doubling the recipie, and they were definately the favored cookie. I used butter instead of the olive oil and based on other recommendations, purchased shelled pistachios. I made them again for gifts for family members and this time dipped them in chocolate. That was a pain. Next time I might drizzle them with chocolate.

I love cookies & Biscotti's are my favorites. Today I made 4 new ones I found at this site, this was not the best one. It has a nice light flavor, but almost to light. All I could taste was the pistachio. I had 5 friends taste & they agreed. I ended up putting a melted powder suger & butter drizzle on top to add flavor. It made them look pretty too. Next time I will double the  vanilla & almond extract. I also made 3 logs instead of two. They were a nice size and you get more cookies. I will double the recipe completly next time for more cookies since your going through the time to make them.

These are wonderful.  I have made them many times.  One time I substituted apricots for the cranberries and almonds for the pistachios.  These were excellent also.

Excellent biscotti!  Easy and delicious.  I made the recipe with almonds instead, and it came out great.  I also changed 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour.

Here's how handle the sticky dough. Work with half at a time and place by heaping tablespoonfuls in center of a strip of plastic wrap about 12inches long. Lift two long sides of wrap and bring together on top of strip. Pressing gently with Hans, shape strip into a smooth loaf about 9 inches long, two inches wide and 1 inch deep. Place both loaves in the freezer for 10-12 minutes (no longer), just until they are non sticky enough to be unwrapped. Unwrap and place on cookie sheets. 

Recipe I use then has you bake for 25 minutes, turning once during baking. Then take out of oven, reduce heat to 300 and let them stand for 5 minutes. Cut into slices and return cut slices to baking sheets. Bake 25 minutes at 300.

This method should take care of stickiness and cutting issues. Always works for me.

These biscotti are the best I ever ate! I tweaked the recipe by using half vegetable oil and half olive oil, and by baking the sliced biscotti on a rack when I put them back into the oven to toast. I made 2 batches. They are great with either coffee or milk, just plain, and I'm not a batter eater, but the batter is even scrumptious! Thanks for another fantastic recipe :D

I followed the recipe exactly as it was written.  It turned out wonderful.  The texture is just soft enough to eat alone and just hard enough to dip in milk or coffee.  It's not too sweet so it is perfect to dip in coffee with sweetened flavored cream.  Delicious with Nutella!
I combined white chocolate, coconut oil and vanilla chai latte drink mix and dipped one end of the biscotti into the white chocolate mixture.  SO GOOD

Very sticky.  Hard to manage.  35 minutes was not not enough  to brown, either.  Something missing from this one.  I got not quite two dozen and I didn't cut generous slices either.  Dough tasted ok though but it seems sweet.  I left out the extracts as I couldn't see much point to putting them in. Not gonna be my go to.

So good and easy! I used a little more cranberries because I didn't have quite enough pistachios but they were delicious! The tip of wetting hands before handling the dough is essential and makes the process very easy! I used a large cookie/ice cream scooper to scoop out onto the sheet pan and then used my wet hands to form the logs. Will definitely make again! Thank you!

I have been making biscotti for years, but I have to say that this was definitely the best and easiest recipe I have ever used.  This will be my new go to biscotti recipe for all time.  I followed the recipe exactly except at the end.  I re-baked the biscotti on each side for 8 minutes each side so they would be nice and dry.  I baked them at 275 degrees.  After cooling, they were given a white chocolate pass with a fork and they looked and tasted awesome.  Last thing: to get more from your batch, slice horizontally.  I got about 36 delicious biscotti.  Perfect size to have with a cup of coffee or tea.  Excellent recipe.  5 stars! Thank you from a sometimes pastry chef!

I've made this biscotti recipe a dozen times and always follow the recipe exactly. I've get so many compliments. I'm Italian and this reminds me of the biscotti my grandmas made. The red and green color are very festive. This has become a family recipe that will be passed down.

These were great!  My husband, who doesn't like biscotti, said I shouldn't make them (and biscotti is just O.K. to me) but I said I wanted to try them since they got such great reviews.  After I did, we both said "Wow! These are great!" and my husband said, "Why did you only make that many?". I only added 1 cup of pistachios because that is all we had. I also added a little less cranberries since I added less pistachios.  I will make them that way from now on. I had to cook them the 2nd time for longer because they were still soft. For those saying they didn't like the olive oil flavor in these, light olive oil has no flavor unlike extra virgin olive oil so make sure you only use the light.

These were wonderful! I increased the vanilla and the almond extract and instead of dried cranberries I used half a bag (1.5 cups) of fresh ones. They were full of flavor and prefect consistency. 
Going to increase the sugar a bit, but with brown sugar next time!

I just made these and it was easier than I thought. I was intimidated by the wet dough comments, but I had to try! They are beautiful and delicious. After reading comments, I used 1 cup each of pistachios and original Craisins. Covered while cooling and pressed down to cut. Only one broke - a long one because my logs spread a bit. Do try these!

I have made this recipe about 10 times, also gave it out to several friends, every one seems to love it, the base is great. You can add more nuts or less, more cranberries or less, you can also modify with almonds & chocolate chunks, I have done that version many times, all times great, you need to cook longer until brown, but thats assuming your oven is accurate. Also, place the Pistachio nuts in a bag & pound on them, that brings added flavor, should be very course , not fine. Love it. Great asset to any dinner party everyone loves them & they always want a few for home.

This is the best biscotti recipe I have ever made or tasted! My Pastry Chef instructor at  culinary school had me give her this recipe! I used a 50/50 ratio of craisins and pistachios.

I have made other biscotti before, so I was used to the sticky dough--just used a spoon to shape it and I didn't really touch it at all.  I can really only rate the texture and general flavor, as I did add some coarsely chopped toasted almonds (in place of the pistachios, which I didn't have on hand) and a handful of toasted coconut flakes (I try to use up leftover baking ingredients when I make biscotti...including, at times, leftover Easter candy or other things my kids get but forget about...)--but as such, I thought the biscotti tasted great.  Olive oil is perfectly fine--you need to use olive oil that is processed for cooking, not for salad use--it has all the olive oil properties but the olive flavor is gone (or drastically reduced).  I use it in all my baking, there is no olive flavor.  The biscotti came out perfectly.  I cut them just a couple of minutes after removing from the oven, using a straight-edged knife and a simple rock-across-the-top and then firm downward push.  None broke.  (Too bad at least ONE didn't break...) ;)

My daughter and I made several different biscotti recipes for Christmas this year & this was one of my favorites. The dough is really sticky so you definitely need to keep your hands wet while working with it. I would recommend changing the oil from olive oil to canola or vegetable oil. The olive oil leaves a definite aftertaste that I didn't care for. I also changed the measurements of cranberries to one cup and pistachios to one cup.We also dipped ours in semi-sweet chocolate which gave them a fancier appearance for our holiday baskets but as far as flavor goes I preferred mine without the chocolate.

This is so delicious! I'm usually not a big fan of biscotti but I was drawn by the pretty red green combo for Christmas. They are soooooo good- I made them just as directed and loved them! I did flatten the loaf a little bit before baking and used a serrated knife to cut it. I will be making this every year I'm sure. It was yummylicious!

If you just cook the nuts for 1-2 minutes and let them cool before using them, your log will cut much easier and won't break by the nuts! That's really true. A patissier will always do so before putting them in a cake, pate or cookie. And thanks for your very great recepi! We loved it very much. Succes with baking in the future.  :-)

Fantastic and easy recipe.  I followed the recipe but changed the following:I used sliced almonds over pistachios based on the reviews and also some orange zest. This was so easy and quick to make, yes the dough does get sticky but if you keep wetting your hands, it will be fine.  I only got 28 pieces, but maybe I wasn't cutting them small enough? All in all, I see myself making this recipe again and trying different variations with it.

Great! I substituted dried cherries and whole almonds, pulsed together in a food processor, for the cranberries and pistachios. Can't wait to try the cranberries and almonds or pecans, since I'm not a big fan of pistachios.

These are awesome!  I increased the amount of extract and the amount of chopped nuts so it has a stronger flavor.  I also use whatever nuts I have on hand.  I've always got almonds in there too.  The dough is sticky but using wet hands helps a lot.  It's also easier to cut them after they've cooled a little but not entirely.

Great I made changes though due to what I had on hand:

1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil (still tastes great!)
1/2 teaspoon green tea powder (replaced almond extract)
Omitted 1/4 teaspoon salt (No salt because my pistachios were already salted)
1 cup pistachio nuts was enough for my recipe
1 5 oz bag of dark chocolate melted which I dipped the biscottis in and let cool in the fridge.

EXCELLENT AND A HUGE SUCCESS!

Following the top reviewers' comments, I added orange zest to the batter (used one whole orange) and added vanilla instead of almond (just because I didn't have one on hand). The taste was amazing! BUT I had two problems (MY fault I'm sure since I'm a very beginner in baking): 1) the log cracked while slicing and I ended up with a big bowl of crumbles (fine, several large chunks were there too); 2) the "crust" (or edges) didn't turn nice brown when done baking. Like I said, it was probably my fault (though I don't know where I went wrong!), so I'm definitely gonna try again and again till I get it right because I love the taste of these biscotti's!!! :D
-----Edit: I made these again with CHOPPED pistachio (chopped for easier slicing) and this time they turned out perfect! Of course few crumbs fell off while slicing, but not one single piece was ruined. I didn't have orange this time but had almond extract on hand. The taste was still amazing PLUS no crack, no crumbling. I didn't even cover my log when I took it out of oven. I am very happy with the result but next time I'll try egg wash just for the look. Went from 4 stars to 5!

The best biscotti.
Delicious, and just wonderful. Perfect. Wouldn't change a thing.
Wetting your hands while working with dough works fantastically.

I have never made biscotti before so to find a perfect recipe to do it the first time was a blessing! I doubled the recipe; one with cranberry walnut with lemon and vanilla extract. The other was toffee almond with almond and vanilla extract. Both came out perfect except I had to bake the toffee almond 2 minutes longer probably because it was on the higher rack in the oven and the toffee was melted so it had trouble holding together. Same with the second baking time, only a minute more. I drizzled milk chocolate over both. Needless to say every single person I gave it to for Christmas raved about it. Thank you for sharing this recipe. It'll permanently be on my list of holiday cookies for years to come.

Expensive letdown!  I followed the recipe to the letter.  When I went to slice the biscotti, most of them broke up into chunks.  Even after the second baking, the end result didn't have the crispness that is present in a good biscotti.  Really disappointing for me.

I made these on a whim after the recipe popped up during a search, and I read the reviews. I wasn't disappointed. They're sweeter, I think, than biscotti usually is, but if you're making it for a Christmas cookie, which I was, it's fitting. After making a single batch, I bought enough stuff to make a double batch before my Christmas parties. I will add these to next year's Christmas-cookie list.

This biscotti was so crumbly for some reason. I followed the recipe exactly and the only ingredient I left out was the almond extract. I made this batch to give away as christmas presents.  I dipped my finished biscotti in milk chocolate and then in holiday nonpareils.  I had to discard 1/3 of the batch because they broke. The dough was very sticky, so you need to wet your hands when spreading the dough out into logs.  I don't think I'll be using this biscotti recipe again, others have worked out much better for me.

This is a great, simple recipe.  I did not have light olive oil, only EVO and so I used 1/2 EVO and half vegetable oil.  They turned out fabulous.  I also used almonds instead of Pistachios and dipped them lengthwise in dark chocolate.  Amazing!  They looked and tasted like something from a wonderful bakery.

Wow! I made these for my Christmas cookie boxes. I made the mistake of tasting one for "quality control."  I ended up making another batch to keep for myself they are so good. I followed a couple other reviews and added a little orange extract and coursley chopped the nuts. They were surprising easy to make. These have earned a permanent place in the cookie boxes.

The cookie had great flavor but it crumbles the minute you go to slice.  I was making these for a cookie exchange and now I dont even have half the amount and I doubled the recipe to make 72!!

This is awesome.  I skip the cranberries use a whole tsp of almond extract.  When they are completely done, I coat one side of the cookie in chocolate and occasionally crushed nuts.  Every time I make them I get recipe requests.

I followed directions exactly, and added orange zest.  I was afraid the batter spread too much when I made the two dough logs, but they turned out ok.  I had no problems cutting, I let the dough cool for 15 minutes before I put back in the oven.

These are super.  They are not too sweet, so I think they are a great addition to the holiday cookie assortment.  The colors are very festive too.  A little dip in white or dark chocolate is a nice addition.  My Sicilian husband approved!

I love recipes that are easily personalized. I made two batches, one with dried cranberries and one with dried cherries. I used almonds in both because that's what I had. I really was surprized at how easy these were to make. They are half gona and aren't even going to last until christmas. I listened to the other reviews and went and bought light olive oil. Glad I did because these are delicious!

These were super and a lot easier than expected. I read all the reviews and took notes. I had my husband chop the nuts finely for me, added the orange zest, used the chilled water for working dough (which really helped shape it quickly), made sure dough was 2" thick (it spread to about 3" to 3-1/2", put a towel over to cool slowly for 10 mins & then moved (1 log at a time) to cutting board and cooled 10 mins with wax paper underneath. Biscotti was still warm but used regular knife and leaned onto it and it cut nicely (removing from wax paper). A few broke but I was able to push together and most of them stayed. After baking 2nd time on half of them I put chocolate chips on while still hot. They melted well and then I spread the chocolate with a knife. I put them in a covered glass cake dish and they looked beautiful and sure tasted yummy with or without coffee.

This was my first time to make biscotti, and I thought this turned out great.  I used a scant 1 cup each of dried cranberries and pistachios.  I also added 1/4 cup of flour.  I live in a humid area, and I usually need to add flour to cookie dough, so it's not a problem with the recipe.  I spooned the dough onto the parchment paper and then used oiled hands to shape.  It spreads, so it doesn't have to be perfectly shaped.  It tasted really great!  I'm excited to share this with friends for Christmas.

This turned out awesome, I ended up with 38 servings of about 3-4 inch long by 1/2 inch wide biscotti.  I followed the recipe except since I had dried cherries on hand instead of cranberries.

SO much easier than I ever imagined, and soooo good!!!  They didn't last a day in our house.  Gave some to my parents and they said "You MADE these??"  I didn't have pistachios, so I used crushed roasted unsalted almonds.  Dipped one side of them in melted chocolate after they were cool.  They look, taste, and smell amazing!  Didn't even last long enough to get a picture of them.  Definitely follow the advice of keeping your hands wet when shaping the dough.  Don't throw it out, even if it doesn't look like it will turn out-- it will!

This was my first attempt at biscotti and it was a cinch!  It was easy to make and delicious!  You definitely need to wet your hands when handling the dough and you must use parchment paper.   I used a lot less pistachio than the recipe called for and chopped them coarsely.  It was so good I'm going to make a second batch before Christmas!

This was really delicious and easy, thank you! I added some orange zest and followed the advice of placing a dish towel over the loaves when they came out of the oven. They were very easy to cut - just put the bread knife right through. Definitely use wet hands to shape.

I made both the Spring Biscotti and the Cranberry Pistachio Biscotti from this site.  I was worried about using olive oil instead of butter.  To make a direct comparison I used the same amount of craisins (3/4 cup) and pistachios (3/4 cup) in each recipe.  I also eliminated any flavorings other than almond and vanilla (ie: omitted orange flavoring).  Honestly there was little difference between the oil and the butter.  The Spring Biscotti with the butter was a little crunchier and a little easier to work with/cut.  The Cranberry Pistachio Biscotti with the oil stuck to the parchment paper a little and was a little more delicate to cut without crumbling.  However, the end result was a little softer than the spring biscotti.  Either recipe is 5 star.  I can't decide which one I will make again as they were so similar but I don't think I can go wrong!

Love this recipe.  Made them last year and they are now a yearly "must". They are delicous and pretty on a plate.  They make a wonderful addition to any holiday gift! Follow the recipe as is and you will not be disappointed.  Note: if you go and change many of the ingredients you are not reviewing the original!

Wonderful and easy! My first time making biscotti and this was a huge success. I used almonds instead of pistachios and it turned out just fine. I also put in some orange zest for added flavor.

This recipe totally rocks!  Common ingredients, easy instructions gives to a never fail dough.  I have made this several time now, changing the "flavor" each time. Choco-chip, almond, hazelnut - they all work amazing with the basic dough.  Thank you so much for sharing!

I have made this recipe about 4 times since Christmas 2007.  It is excellent. I use about 1/2 cup pistachios and 1/2 cup cranberries.  The last two times I added a tbsp of lemon zest.  It adds a nice flavor to the biscotti.  To easily handle the dough,I chill the dough about an 1-1/2 hours and wet my hands with very cold water.  Great cookie for coffee in the morning.

Made these for Christmas and I'm happy to say I will be making them every Christmas from now on. These were a nice surprise. I had never made biscotti before and didn't know what to expect. The dough was very wet, but I followed the advice of keeping my hands wet with cool water while forming the "logs". I thought they looked awfully sloppy as I put them in the oven. I was pleasantly surprised when I took them out to slice the logs. They looked so professional! So have no fear if your dough seems too wet! Thanks for a great recipe that was absolutely delicious and well received by everyone who tried them.

I can't say that I followed this recipe exactly, but it was so good that I had to mention it.  I ended up substituting dried cherries for the cranberries and almonds for the pistachios.  I LOVE almond, so I switched the amounts for the almond and vanilla extract.  Yep...I've pretty much devoured the entire batch myself.  Thanks for the recipe.

I just tried this reciepe last week. It was absolutely amazing. I dipped the biscotti in white chocolate and candy cane pieces, and substituted the almond extract for peppermint extract to add a little christmas flare. The results were amazing!!!

I used tin foil instead of parchment paper and it worked well, however if you read the reviews before shopping, i would definitely get the parchment paper.

Also, I doubled the reciepe to get long pieces of biscotti like in the cafes.

Happy baking!

Excellent, easy recipe.  Taste and look professional. Hard to stop eating.  I sliced them right out of the oven, with a very sharp knife and they had nice clean cuts.  Thanks for posting a great recipe!

I made this because I was lucky enough to get some fresh pressed vanilla bean olive oil.  It was fabulous!!!!  Next time I am just going to make it with plain olive oil; I am sure it will be just as wonderful.  I substituted cashew pieces for the pistachios because they were cheaper. Later note:  this has become my favorite biscotti recipe.  I now always make it with pistachios.  The green of the nuts with the red of the cranberries make it perfect for Christmas. Everyone loves it.  I dip the bottoms in melted white chocolate.

This is a great biscotti recipe- nothing needs to be changed at all! For my personal preference, I like to add some extra cranberries, but the regular recipe is fabulous as is- I definitly recommend it.

Great recipe!  Thank you!  One tip other bakers may find helpful.  I used a medium size ice cream scoop (with a release lever), to scoop the dough and form two even lines of "dough-balls" on the parchment paper.  I then used a moisted butter knife to easily spread the lined up scoops into two logs.  Worked great!  No mess!

Love these.  The pistachios and cranberries make a lovely combination.  They turned out beautifully, and the only thing I did different was add a half cup more of dried cranberries.  I'll have to try this out again sometime with different dried fruits and nuts.

My first time making biscotti. The drying part took a lot longer than 8-10 mins, but I'm glad I waited. This is so lovely. One thing I'll definitely do next time...get shelled pistachios!!! mY NAILS almost came off. ;P

I cannot give this recipe a fair review but I can tell you what I did so you won't try it.  I used 1/2 reg. (1/8 c)olive oil and 1/2 canola oil.  My oil may have been a little old or too strong for this recipe as it left an aftertaste.  I also used macadamia nuts and they might have been overpowering too.  I dipped an end in white chocolate hopeing to soften the flavor.  I won't make again.  Will look for a recipe that uses butter.  I made these again and forgot I made them the first time.  I made the same mistake the second time.  Only used 1/8 EVOO and 1/8 canola.  Same strong taste.  DO NOT do this.  Do not add more flour before adding nuts.  I crushed the nuts a bit then added.  Used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose but don't think that made a difference.  Also used dried cherries instead of cranberries.  Traded the amount of vanilla extract with the amount of almond extract and liked that idea.

This an excellent recipe.  I was a first time biscotti maker, and I had researched many recipes and techniques.  My final choice was between this recipe and an America's Test Kitchen recipe; I went with this one for my first batch because it looked so easy (no egg separating) and relatively healthy; I made with almonds as I could not find shelled pistachios.  The first batch my dough was extremely runny and sticky, and spread a lot in the oven. They cracked a bit with slicing after cooling 10 minutes but tasted fantastic, great texture.  After more research the next night, I made some adjustments, the most important of which was sifting then measuring the flour.  I also upped cranberries to a cup and cut almonds back to a cup. This batch was much less runny and sticky, easy to mold into gorgeous loaves.  I cooled for 15-20 minutes and this batch turned out picture perfect (no breaks) and just as tasty.  Fantastic simple recipe.  I'll be making my 3rd batch (for christmas gifts) tonight.  Can't wait to tinker with other fruits and flavorings.

This biscotti is wonderful and is so easy to make.  I used dried cherries instead of cranberries and added 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips.  As the final touch, I dipped them in melted white chocolate.  Perfect for gift giving and SO tasty!

To die for!!  I've been toying with biscotti recipes for a couple of years, but this is the best.  Tart, sweet and salty...all the best flavors.  I did the recipe exactly as mentioned (make sure you have unsalted pistachios, or heed the suggestion.)  A very good Christmas gift with the colors.  One thing I realized:  I had some ends that didn't get double baked and they were just as good, but a better texture for those who don't like the hard, crispy, traditional biscotti.  Will try as regular cookies as well!  Thank you so much for an excellent recipe.

Very yummy!  I thought the dough was very sticky and hard to work with though.  Placing it on the parchment paper really helped.  I used almonds instead of pistachios, and it was delicious!  The almond extract lends a very subtle flavor that is awesome!  I would definitely recommend this recipe!

First time making biscotti and this turned out great.  I used finely chopped walnuts instead of pistachios.   The dough is sticky so make sure you dip your hands in cold water before attempting to place it on the cookie sheet.  Also, I baked the 2nd time for twice as long to make them crispier.

Worth all 5 stars.  I made 5 different Biscotti in one day and this one came out on top.  I substituted sliced almonds for the pistachios.  Also increased cranberries to 1 cup and reduced nuts to only 1 cup.  This is THE prettiest biscotti I made.  The kids made a batch for themselves and didn't do the 2nd baking time because they liked them soft.

Very delicious recipe, even though I made a few changes. I susbtituted almonds in place of the pistachios, which I chopped up and toasted. I also used 1/2 tsp of cinnamon instead of almond extract. I prefer a harder biscotti that can stand up to dipping in my coffee; so after baking the slices for 10 minutes at 275, I flipped the slices over and baked for an additional 10 minutes. Yum.

Followed this recipe to a T and they came out absolutely wonderful. The dough is very sticky, a followed another reviewer's advice and wet my hands to help form the loaves.

Also, make sure the loaves cool at least 15 or 20 minutes before cutting to prevent the dough from crumbling.

After cutting, I cooked the cookies 10 minutes on each side and they were perfect.

It's a decent amount of work so I would double the recipe to really make it worth it. Don't worry, they will go fast!

These are fantastic, and so easy! They look so perfect, I can't believe I made them myself! I added 1/4 cup of extra flour to the recipe and had no problems with runny dough. Great flavor, the almond is just what you need for an extra touch-- I used 1 tsp instead of 1/2 and they turned out wonderfully. Pre-shelled pistachios would definitely have saved me a lot of trouble, but they're so much more expensive than the shell-on kind!

What a yummy recipe!  I had never made biscotti before & was concerned these wouldn't come out.  Well, boy was I wrong!  These were such a hit during the holidays.  It really impressed people more than cookies.  I would definitely make this again.

I guess I had big expectations for this one.  It wasn't bad, but just not good enough for me to make again.  Ok--I confess----being Italian---maybe I'm more picky about biscotti! I did frost one side, which was a plus, but then the amount of sugar should have been adjusted.

I crushed up the pistachios and used one cup of fresh cranberries.  They are much better and give it much more taste  when they pop while baking.

These biscotti have become a standard at my home.  I follow the recipe exactly as stated without trouble, and I always get compliments.  I find the shelled pistachios at Trader Joes, and actually the dried (not sweetened) cranberries too.  I always double the recipe and use a total of 3 cups pistachios which does seem like alot, but they are so tasty I wouldn't think of using less.  Thank you for this recipe, it's one of my favorites!

This was wonderful.  It's flavor and texture and ease of preparation.  I made them for Christmas and glazed at the end with red and green sugar cookie icing (I also got that recipe from here). They were a big hit.  I had to let you know!! PRIMO

I followed a lot of the suggestions and this biscotti came perfect! I’m going to list them for anyone who doesn’t want to read through every review (like I did) and piece together the tips. Add more cranberries. Rough chop pistachios. Use wet hands when hand mixing in nuts and cranberries. Use parchment paper sprayed with canola oil to divide batter and make logs. If you want more crispy biscotti leave in oven @275 for 12-20 minutes, flipping is optional. The recipe is perfect as is but never smother your right to be creative ! Have fun ??

This is now my go-to biscotti recipe. I have made it at least 5 times, and plan on making it again today. The recipe is very flexible in terms of ingredients, to give different flavor variations, which I have tried such as:
I often substitute oatmeal for 3/4 c of flour to give it more fiber; 
Use all almond extract and add 1/2 c dark chocolate chips and subbing dried cherries for cranberries and used almonds instead of pistachios; 
anise extract instead of almond and vanilla, omitting nuts and berries
All in all this is the best biscotti recipe I have ever made! Thank you for sharing this!

This is soooo good dunked in your coffee!  Takes some time, but a lazy afternoon is the best time to make it. On the second baking, I flipped them over after ten minutes, just to dry them evenly.

This is my first review on this site, and I have to add my opinion to this recipe. The biscotti is still cooling off on my wire rack as I am writing this...Super yummy!!
It is very easy to follow the instruction, and this turns out beautifully...Will dip bottom in melted chocolate once they cool off.

Not a fan. I used evoo and was disappointed that the cookies had a distinct olive oil taste to them. Very disappointed.

Best biscotti recipe I have ever tried, and relatively healthy too.  When I made it again today I had a revelation.  Instead of shaping the loaves in rectangles, I angled the ends in a sort of parallelogram so I didn't have those odd ends to cut off.  I got more nice cookies out of the recipe and no odd pieces.

This turned out great in both looks and taste!  Followed the ingredients exactly.  I think the very faint taste of the olive oil really works with the pistachio.  After the initial bake, I cooled them 15 minutes in the pan on a rack, then cut by forcing a chef knife right through them.  You'll crumble if you saw with a serrated.  For the second reduced-temp bake, based on some other recipes I've used, I did one side 8 minutes, then flipped them and baked the other for 12 minutes.  Cooled them "standing up" so air would hit both sides of the cookie.   Perfection.

Like all the other reviewers, I love this biscotti recipe.  I give them to all my friends because then I can make more!  I don't substitute anything; I follow the recipe exactly as written.  I am going to make some tomorrow to give as a hostess gift at a dinner party.  I buy my shelled pistachios at Costco.  They are little pricey, but worth it.

I made these to give to friends at work who loved them so much, they've requested more for an Italian themed luncheon.  I loved the ease of making them as well as being soft enough to enjoy without dipping in a drink. They are sooooo flavorful!  I also use butter instead of the olive oil...makes them taste more decadent!

This is my "go to" recipe for biscotti!  I took the advice of others and substituted slivered almonds instead of pistachios (too much work shelling them).  I also added 1/4 tsp orange extract and took the advice of others and covered them with a kitchen towel once they came out of the oven, while they cooled.  I also drizzled with white and dark chocolate once they were set.  As for cutting them I've tried several things.  What works for me is using a straight edge sharp knife and as you're cutting, gently bear down while moving the knife forward all at the same time.  So you're doing two actions at once, moving the knife forward and gently bearing down.  I hope that makes sense.  Enjoy!

Fantastic biscotti that always gets rave reviews!  I use my electric knife to cut logs on an angle  (after 10 minutes cooling time) and they slice perfectly clean with no breakage!  Also use another posters tip for putting half the dough at a time on wax paper sprayed with cooking oil.  This way i can make the logs without sticky hands and there is no mess.  These make wonderful holiday gift for co workers or neighbors!

So great! I made it with chocolate chips. The perfect cookie with a cup of tea on this cold windy day. The second time I made these I added a bit less than 1/4 oil, probably around 1/8 and a little less sugar. The dough wasn't as sticky but it was still delicious and a tad bit healthier or so I tell myself.  I didn't let the cookies cool for the recommended 10 min I just cut them right away and returned them to the oven. I didn't have any issues with the cookie cracking.

This is a very good recipe indeed, a little bit on the sweet side for me though! Make sure the logs are completely cool before you cut them or else they crumble -crazy crumbling, seriously! To reduce the olive oil aftertaste I've replaced 2 tablespoons of it with vegetable (corn) oil, and they turned out fine! Also, they are so versatile! I'll bake them again for sure!

OK. I never tried making biscotti before, but I have pretty good instincts about baking. I made adjustments to the recipe to my liking....no almond extract, but added a tablespoon of fresh orange zest, and a 1/4 tsp of orange extract.  And I chopped the nuts and dried cranberries in  my Cuisinart mini-chop to achieve a relatively equal size of nuts and fruit. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter. 

Once the logs were cooked, I covered them with a dish towel to mitigate cooling. I used a sharp chef's knife to cut them. Then, 10 minutes at 275 degrees in the oven finished them beautifully.

I love them! I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil, because my family loves EVOO. These are too good! They are great little Christmas cookies. The colors are great, and I really loved them. Not much else to eat them with than a cup of coffee or hot chocolate, which is fine because tomorrow for breakfast, these are going to be gone!

This recipe has great potential but needs major improvements.  I made my first batch following directions even though the oven temperatures seemed low to me.  I love pistachios but wondered about the cost of that many nuts.  I used dried cranberries and candied kiwi fruit slices I found in my local grocery store.  I cut the candied kiwi slices into little pieces.  The results tasted good but weren't dry enough, etc.  I am making a second batch now with changes.  I added a little more flour and am cooking them at 350°, as recommended by Joy of Cooking.  The loaves are out of the oven now and are nice and brownish.  In a few minutes I will slice them and bake the slices at 350° per Joy of Cooking.  I know they will make great Christmas presents.  I think biscotti made with the original recipe probably won't be dry enough to keep long without getting moldy.  Make my changes and you will have a ten-star recipe!

This was the best biscotti cookie I ever made! I have tried many biscotti recipes, and none of them can touch this one. It was easy to make; the hint of wetting your hands while shaping the logs worked wonderfully! They were sweet, but not too sweet. I followed the recipe exactly with a tad less pistachios, but only because the amount I bought was a little shy of the full amount. I don't think this lack altered the taste at all. I did have to bake them a lot longer for the first baking time, but I'm not sure my oven was working well. I baked them until they were a little browned, let them rest for about 10 minutes, then cut them. I had no problem with the cookies splitting when cutting them. I used a chef's knife, and pressed down on the handle and blade to make a clean cut. I also baked them the second time about 12 minutes, but again, it could have been my oven acting up. My husband had one, and said they were the best biscotti he ever had, even better than the Italian bakeries here. I'm going to hide them, as I want to serve them at Christmas. I will definitely make these again. Oh.....I did roughly chop the pistachios and cranberries before incorporating them into the batter. These are DELICIOUS!!!!!

My Grandma was the holiday cookie maker in the family until 4 or 5 years ago when I made this biscotti and inadvertently took over the task. Now I have to make it every year or get an earful. It's a bit messy, but having wet hands makes it doable. I usually flip them after the second baking time and add another 8-10 min to really get them dry.

Loved these!  They didn't make it to Christmas, had to make a second batch.  I used one cup each nuts and cranberries.  I rough cut the nuts.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon orange zest I allowed the logs to cool on the cookie sheet for 30 minutes under a tea towel, then cut with a large chef knife.  I just leaned on the blade, do not saw!  I had no crumbling.

These are delicious, but the recipe only gave me 16 cookies--nowhere near what it said it would! They might be slightly larger than the instructions called for, but not significantly so. Disappointed in the yield, but they were easy enough that I can make more.

Love love this one! Used butter instead of oil ~ upped the amount of cranberries for more color ~ baked at 350 for 25 min. ~ cooled 10 min. ~ then cut and bake 10 min. on each side as directed. Fabulous!!!

This, I think has become my favourite cookie. So far for Christmas this year we have made 6 batches. I find that equal cranberries and pistachios work really well. After the season I will experiment with other dried fruits and nuts and perhaps chocolate and lemon zest, or pecans and citron peel (bought in the spice bazaar in Istanbul) or ???. The most important thing is that I and my wife and 18 year old son absolutely love these biscotti!

Having baked biscotti for many years, I decided to try this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of substituting canola oil for light olive oil which I don't have. The resulting biscotti are colorful and delicious. It is important to keep your raw batter logs at the 2" diameter so they bake fully on the first baking. Then allow them to cool completely, not just 10 minutes as the recipe states. Once cool, the logs can be cut with a serrated knife and then baked again. If after cooling the 2nd time the biscotti are not crisp enough, bake them again for 10 minutes as I did. Sadly, I'll have to make another batch because all of the biscotti have been eaten. Thanks for a red and green holiday treat which I'll use all year.

I give this recipe five stars as it is written. I never change anything about it because it is perfect as is. I make this every year for Christmas and always receive rave reviews. The only problem I've ever had with it is when I over-baked the cookies the first time I ever made then and that's not the fault of the recipe poster - I just lost track of time and they turned a little "Cajun". Even then they still tasted good once I scraped off the burned bits.

These are very tasty!  I only used 1 cup of nuts and thought that was too much.  Next time I'll decrease the nuts a bit more and add about a 1/4 cup more cranberries.  With these changes, this is definitely a 5 star recipe.  Make sure to use the damp hands to shape the loaf and cover with a towel after removing from the oven the first time.  I had no trouble with the cookies cracking or breaking.

This was my first time making biscotti and it wasn't as awful as I thought it would be! THe dough is definitely sticky so wet your fingers. The only difficulty i had was making two decent size logs. I tend to be a perfectionist and want them both to look the same-- but that won't necessarily happen! Taste is great though ..did everything by the recipe.  I used a serrated knife -- but may try and use my weight on the cutting aspect as oppose to sawing it back and forth (so it doesn't break and crumble too much). Other then that…definitely try this!

I followed the recipe exactly. The pistachio is a little much, I'll cut down by 1/2 c next time. Up the cranberries just slightly cause I love them. When the biscotti came out of the oven the first time, I covered them with a cloth to cool them slower. Also, the dough it really sticky, so I used a bowl of water to periodically wet my fingers. The dough didn't rise or move at all, so make it as wide or thick as you prefer. I did not get 36 servings, I got 23, but my biscotti were admittedly thick and tall. I dipped in melted chocolate chips and had with my coffee for breakfast.

I have made this several different times, and its always a hit! I like that it uses olive oil--it makes it a little less sweet and a little more Italian. I usually change out the pistachios for almond slivers, then drizzle melted white chocolate on after the second bake.

I like the amount of pistachio and cranberry.  I shared with some friends who also thought these were very good.  When I was cutting them after the first baking, a few fell apart, however that didn't take away from enjoying them!  Will definitely make them again.

I've used this basic dough recipe several times now and it has always come out perfectly!  My friends can't stop eating them so now I make two batches at once so there is a little left for the family!
I've added different nuts and different berries (I used dried cherries with pecans last time - HUGE HIT!) I cool them slowly in the oven, before slicing and use a long bread knife to slice, making the cookies the day before works well! They store very well in glad ware containers.  I have also dipped the ends in shell chocoate with good (and very pretty) results!

I followed everything exactly, except I exchanged the almond extract for rum extract!  NICE!  I also threw in garnished oranges, EVEN better!  The batter came out a bit too soupy.  So I added 1/4 more cup of flour to give it some body. 

Heads up, WET your hands prior to handling the dough and take off your ring! It is GOOPY and will spread out about 2 to 4 inches more at the end. Nevertheless, it was WORTH IT!

My husband mocked at me and didn't think pistachios goes well with dried fruit - WRONG!  He turned out to be a BISCOTTI MONSTER!  :-)

First batch I followed the recipe to the letter, it is very good as written.  Second (and many batches later)  I made the following adjustments after reading the other reviews.  Changed the ratio of pistachios and cranberries (Craisins) to one cup each.  Added the zest of one orange to each double recipe. Drizzled white chocolate melted with a bit of shortening over the top.
I used a good serrated bread knife to do the slicing and had no problems whatsoever.  A bread knife is serrated differently than a regular serrated knife.
I baked on a silicone sheet rather than parchment paper, worked wonderfully. But don't slice on it!
These were a huge success with the cookie exchange at work.

Ok, I have made this three times now and it is a crowd pleaser! I do make alterations - but rating based on original posted recipe is still 5 stars following it exactly. If you love this as much as me consider trying these changes if you make them a second or third time - add 1 tbsp orange zest sub. for almond extract, slivered almonds sub for pistachio and 1/2 cup white choc. chips. Roll (it is very thick) and cut out. After baking, I used a pack of white chocolate chips, melted and added in two tablespoons of juice from an orange and 1 tablespoon of water. I poured the melted orange chocolate mixture into piping bag and decorated the cookies - they taste delicious and it is an easy recipe to sub in all your favourite ingredients.

Firstly, I'm not a biscotti lover....saying that I was really surprised with how good these turned out.
Followed alot of other reviews suggestions .....
used 2 cups flour, chopped nuts/craisins, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and orange extract and a full orange's zest, brushed with egg wash, baked at 325 for 30 mins then 275 for 15 mins... placing cookies on wire cooling rack, didn't have to turn them over.
Here's where my impatience came in handy! I cut them with a chefs knife as soon as they came out of the oven....worked beautifully, not a cracked cookie in sight. Just held on the loaf with a dish towel to protect my hands.
My Dad is on his way over as I type, he's very excited about biscotti. He'll be the real judge, I'll post if there are any objections to these cookies!

I can't say enough good about these biscotti.  Yes, I made a few alterations, but only because I didn't have everything on hand.  I used regular EVOO, and it worked just fine.  I didn't have almond extract or almonds, so I used lemon extract and toasted pumpkin seeds.  Also, I was feeling "spicy" so I added 1 tsp each of ground cardamon, and cinnamon, and 1/8 tsp cloves.  They were so great!!! I can't wait to buy the original ingredients and try it again.  I believe that with this recipe, you could add any flavouring you want and have them turn out perfectly.  WET YOUR HANDS while working with the very sticky dough (I had my doubts about because they were so sticky), but the cookies were as I already stated, perfect.  Thank-you!!

Living in the lowcountry of SC (Charleston) I use toasted chopped pecans. They are so easy to use without having to shell them. They also taste wonderful with the cranberries. These are ALWAYS a big hit when your guests are ready for the coffee/hot tea time.  To save on using parchment paper each time, I place a silpat silicone sheet on a baking tray. They come off so easy and I don't need to buy parchment paper. I do not like the olive oil, and as suggested, I use margerine. Since it has a high vegetable oil content, it works great. Enjoy these treats!

Very good.  Only complaint is that I found it VERY difficult to chop the pistachio nuts (they are hard little buggars!).  I do not have a food processor, so maybe that was the problem.  Next time I might try a different kind of nut.

The first thing you may notice is that this recipes starts with olive oil.  I thought it a bit odd, but these are fabulous.  My husband wants me to keep them instead of giving some away for gifts.   I didn't have light olive oil and used a really fruity extra virgin and they are fantastic.  The tip about wetting your hands while forming the logs is a good hint.  These will be found in my home a lot in the future.  I am considering drizziling lightly with white chocolate for the next batch.   You must try these!

These biscotti are very good.  I made the recipe as is except for substituting the pistachio with cashews as that is what I had on hand.  Great for your Christmas cookie tray.

This was my first time making biscotti and it came out wonderful. Subbed Tia Maria (coffee liqueur) for the extracts, mini chocolate-chips for the cranberries, and hazelnuts for the pistachios. I did have to toy around with the cooking times though. Got 26 cookies. Will dunk tip in chocolate before offering in my goodies box.

YUMMY BISCOTTI!   As with others, I did not use the full amount of fruits or nuts, but it still tasted great!  I made several batches and plan to continue using this recipe in the future as it's really very simple and fast to make!    Base recipe is great... easy to substitute the nuts and fruits as you like - I made some with currants that tasted pretty good!  I also played around with the proportions and types of extracts used.   Best tip I read was to wet your hands when working with the dough, shaping it, etc.   No problems at all with the dough being too liquidy as other reviews had indicated.   The cookie didn't brown up too much, but still looks and tastes wonderful!  Happy Baking!

I happened to have all the ingredients, except the dry cranberry. I used raisin as substitute, and it turned out great!! I have tried some other recipes before, but none of them is as great as this one. I think the light olive oil is the secret weapon here. Some recipes calls for butter and some do not have oil. Without oil the biscotti cannot be tasted crispy, but the butter rally ruins the original italian snack flavor. All in all, this is the best recipe of biscotti ever!!!!! Try it, you will never disappoint!!

I made this for Thanksgiving and got rave reviews.  I dipped the biscotti in white chocolate.  The pistachios with the cranberries taste wonderful and make the biscotti beautiful.

Awesome recipe. Added 1 t. of Boyajian orange oil, reduced the pistachios to about 3/4 C and added a few more cranberries.  Made one loaf without the orange oil and definitely prefer it with the orange flavor.  Perfect combo for the holidays.

Amazingly good; they disappeared very very very quickly. It is key to wet your hands, or the dough will stick. But do not otherwise worry about the dough being too sticky: it does turn out fine after baking.

This is the first time I have ever posted on a website for recipes...although I almost always get my inspiration through this method.   I have to say this recipe is quick, easy and the result is always a crowd pleaser...  I know the recipe off by heart now I have made it so many times.

This recipe is amaizing! it's my first try baking biscotti and it taste better than the ones you get at the cafes. This recipe is so versatile I tried making some using almonds instead of the pistachios and also added some grated orange rind in the mixture and my kitchen smells so good:-) I'm going to mail some to my mom for mother's day :-) thanks for a great recipe!!

These were great biscotti.  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have Pistachio's but I did have cashews.  These were a big hit with the family.

This is the first time I've ever made biscotti, and it was really fun and easy.  The cookie is absolutely delicious, and everyone in my family loved it.  I used an ice cream scooper (the kind with a trigger) to transfer the dough onto the parchment paper, making two 12" rows.  I then dampened my hands with cool water and shaped the balls into logs.  This was much easier than trying to manipulate the dough completely by hand.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I can't wait to make it again, especially at Xmas time.

I just finished it and it is very tasty! I was worried about the nuts and cranberries going together but they accent each other nicely. I followed this recipe exactly except I omitted the salt because I used shelled snacking nuts (sorry hubby) which are already very salty. It looks pretty too.

These are fantastic. I cannot believe I made something that tastes so good and it wasnt that difficult either. I chopped up the pistachios but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. Wetting your hands really helps mold the dough into logs. These taste great by themselves but even better with good coffee. I think the almond extract really helps take them over the top. Definitely will make these again...and again.

My mom was looking for a good biscotti recipe that wasn't too sweet so I gave her this recipe, I haven't tried these yet but sheis giving really good ratings. If she could she would rate this 10+ stars. The only thing she did different was used frozen cranberries, she thawed them and drained the liquid, cut them in half, she also used doubled the cranberries. I also gave her the advise from another review to use water to wet hands and clean hands when rolling the dough and she said this worked really well. She will deffinatly make these again and again and again. I'm going to have to try it myself. Thanks for the great recipe.

I thought biscotti would be a big pain to make... it isn't so! So easy! I substituted the pistachios with walnuts and omitted the almond extract... also, I used the olive oil with the first batch and canola with the second - it could be all in my head, but I prefer the canola batch. I added these to Christmas treat plates this year and got very positive feedback (on the biscotti specifically)... will make again and again!

Earned every star!  I opted for almonds - they turned out great.  I did bake a little longer than called for - wanted to be sure they were nice and dried out.

This is one of the best tasting biscotti I have ever eaten! Even my husband couldn't keep his hands off of it and he's not a fan of cranberries. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used half regular Craisins and half orange flavored. It came out very nice with a just hint of orange taste. I made this as a gift and will definitely make again for myself next time!

This was my first time making biscotti and they were such a success! I actually made them for an Italian Christmas party (my husband thought I was crazy to make it and take it before ever trying it) I got absolute raves for this biscotti from all our Italian relatives.
I followed the recipe almost exactly except I used grapeseed oil instead of olive oil and I added candied ginger to the mix.  I also played with different flavorings.  I used orange extract instead of almond in some of the cookies, also adding orange zest and sometimes walnuts instead of almonds.  Keeping your hands wet is absolutely necessary in shaping this as it is sticky but dont add more flour, just work fast and get it in the oven right away.  Covering the cookies with a clean dish towel for 10 minutes right after the first baking worked great too.  I used a bread knife to cut the cookies.  I also dipped one end in melted chocolate bark and put them in the freezer for a few minutes to harden the chocolate. YUM!  I have probably made 10 batches of these cookies already this Christmas season for gifts and everyone raves over them.
Also I used this recipe to make savory biscotti.  Omitting the sugar, using good extra virgin olive oil and the almond extract, cranberries and walnuts.  The dough is dryer to work with and I coated my hands with olive oil to shape them. After the final baking I put them flat on a cookie sheet and drizzled olive oil on top, spread some minced garlic on each biscotti and shredded i

Delicious!!!!  Definitely leave out the salt if you use the salted pistachios- and definitely add more pistachios and cranberries.  Also- you may as well double it now, or you will have to make more when everyone eats all of them so quickly.

This is the best! This was my first attempt at biscotti and boy did it come out perfect! I never tried it before, although I love these, thinking it may be too much of a mission, but it was not! Also, I dont quite fancy those hard rock ones, but after reading some of these reviews, I went for it. My husband can not stop munching on them! A few changes I made, I increased the cranberries to 3/4 cup, and I only had half a cup of pistachios, so I added another half cup of almonds. It was just right, I think more nuts would have been alittle too much. I also reduced the sugar to half a cup. Everything else was just perfect! The cold water helped a ton with dealing with the sticky dough, and since I dint seem to have a problem with slicing the logs as other reviewers have mentioned?
This recipe is a keeper!!

These were really yummy! My mom, who had never had biscotti and was very suspicious of them, had nothing but praise for them. They were easy, but a warning to the wary - the batter is difficult to work with and does not taste good. You just have to trust in the recipe - the final product is worth it!

Wonderful easy recipe, thank you for sharing it!  I used orange zest & sliced almonds vs. the cranberries and pistachio.    They are delicious!  Followed advice from reviews and used a sharp knife to cut them as soon as they came out of the oven, and they sliced neatly.  I wasn't able to achieve 3 dozen with the recipe, I would easily need to double it.  However, they are so easy, it is no problem to make another batch!

I've made 7 batches of this for this Christmas.  I love that it's not too hard and not too soft.  I recommend a 1-to-1 cup ratio of nuts to cranberries to better balance the flavor.  Also, upon the 2nd baking, I did 8 minutes on BOTH sides (not just one), otherwise it was too soft.  So I also suggest 8 minutes on one side, flip over and another 8 minutes on the other side.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe and made 3 logs that were a little bigger. In the beginning I was frustrated because I could not find pistachios that were shelled and it was time consuming and hard on the fingers to shell that many pistachios but had forgotten all that by the time I tasted these! I used my favorite Wusthof knife to cut these after the first bake and had no problem at all. Those pistachios didn't stand a chance. Definitely use your sharpest, non serrated knife. I am going to make this recipe again but going to use dried cherries and almonds just for something different. These were perfect as they are though.

Yummy!  The only things i changed were to make half of the dough cranberry almond and to make the other half double chocolate chip (by adding a square of melted chocolate and chocolate chips.)  My only complaint is that i would have liked them a little crispier, so next time I'll bake them longer.

These are great. The only changes I made were reduced the pistachios to 1/2 cup, and I didn't bake it twice. These look great and were easy to make. So far, the best biscotti I've made.

Out of all the cookies I've baked in the past month, these were hands down my favorite! Everyone in my family loved them, especially my aunts. Also, my dad got a kick out of helping me cut them. He did a great job! :)

Taste was very good, but I have a few issues: 1) NO WAY will this make 36 biscotti!!  I doubled this and have only 16!  2) I followed directions to a 'T' and still had trouble cutting these and having them be very gooey still.  I let them bake the second round for 10 min and still they were half "raw"  so in for another half hour or so and STILL they are not cooked completely....very disappointing indeed!

An excellent biscotti recipe. I used 1 cup of pistachios (instead of 1 1/2) and added 1/2 cup coarsly chopped white chocolate chips. I baked both the logs and cookies at 300 degrees F. and left the cookies in for 15 minutes. I did use an electric knife to slice the logs into cookies pre the second baking - a serrated knife wasn't working for me. Great results.

This was exceptional! My family and friends could not get enough. It was so easy to make, there is no way I'll be paying 2.50 for one cookie at Starbucks any longer!  Followed it to the letter.

Although the flavor is wonderful, I found these to be a bit dense.  I felt they should have been a little bit "airier".  Also, a bit heavy on the pistacchios - next time I'll use 1 cup instead of 1 1/2.

Easy & delicious!  Several people told me they didn't like biscotti, until they tried these.  They are softer, easier on the teeth than usual coffee-shop biscotti.  The pistachio/cranberry flavors are wonderful together.  They even keep very well and are good for a couple weeks.

1/3/07: Fantastic recipe!  I didn't have any pistachios so I used walnuts and they turned out spectacular.  I did have to bake them a little longer, but they were superb.  The next day I made lemon almond biscotti using the same recipe, but with the obvious substitutions and used lemon extract.  Really, really good!  There are so many possible combinations to this simple, but sophisticated cookie that I can't wait to try them out.  12/19/09: Didn't realize I had made these before until now!  I made them with pistachios this time and then drizzled them with white chocolate and milk chocolate ganache.  They look incredible and taste phenomenal!  Tried and true recipe that deserves to be made more than once a year.  I also find that it is easier to slice them all at the same time and then move them instead of doing one by one.  The support of the entire "log" seems to prevent them from falling apart.  When you remove them from the oven on the second bake, they will still feel somewhat like regular cookies.  Let them sit on racks and they will dry like biscotti fairly fast.  Made another batch yesterday: lemon blueberry (using dried blueberries) with lemon extract and lemon glaze.  Yum!

I am a convert!  I thought making biscotti was difficult and you proved me wrong.  This was my first time making it and I followed the instructions, EXACTLY.  The most important point is running cool water over your hands to handle the dough.  Don't dry your hands. Give them a quick shake and form the dough logs. I did place the dough on my plastic silicone pastry mat and used my dough scraper to cut the dough in half. As for the results, I am glad I doubled the recipe like others suggested.  This was the biggest hit with everyone this Christmas.  My Dad wants me to make it regularly for him.  Mom is not fond of cranberries so the next batch will be with dried cherries. Absolutley the most delicious cookie!!

Yummy!I added some grated lemon zest (1 tsp.) to the dough in my second batch& it gave the biscotti some zing. Try it! It gives the dough an added depth of flavor. I opted to melt Godiva white chocolate chips in a heat-proof bowl over a pot of simmering water. When the biscotti where done, I simply dipped them halfway into the white chocolate. I prepared a parchment-lined cookie sheet and placed the dipped biscotti on it. I then sprinkled red&green decorator sugar and placed the sheet of biscotti in the fridge to allow the white chocolate to set. These cookies looked so beautiful on a tray. I only wish I had taken a picture to share with the rest of you; they were ALL gone in less than 24 hours!

Wonderful.  This was the first biscotti I ever made but I do alot of baking. So I will warn you the dough could not be any more sticky.  On my second batch, which I doubled because they are that good, I put the dough into the frig for several hours and that made a huge difference in forming the logs.  This recipe will definately be added to my keeper list.  Thanks.

This recipe yields delicious biscotti that are a little bit denser than other biscottis. The flavor is wonderful and the combination of pistachios and dried cranberries gives it a very Christmas-y appearance. I added about a tablespoon of finely grated orange zest and drizzled melted white chocolate after they were cooled. I definitely recommend this recipe!

This was great! 

Better than several others I've tried so far.

Most others I've found used butter and much more flour
they also took way longer to get that light brown look
in an "Electric Oven" 

How about a Almond and Choclate version or I've simply missed it !

Thank you keep it Italian !

Perfect every time.  I've made it as written, but prefer my alterations (from other reviews)
1/4 tsp Orange Extract (no almond)
1 c pistachio
1 c dried cranberries

After baking, dip in melted white chocolate.  Amazing and a wonderful holiday gift.

I have made these at Christmas for 3 years now and they have always been delicious.  I always get raves.  I had never made biscotti before making these.  I did find that they needed 45 minutes of cooking and that they needed more than 10 minutes to dry.  To dry them, I usually turn them twice (5 minutes each time)for a total of 10 minutes on each side.  It is difficult to find shelled pistachios in my area so that part is time consuming -- but worth it.  This is a beautiful Christmas cookie for sharing.

SO GOOD! I've made 5 different biscotti recipes from this site, and this recipe is easily the best. The only changes I made were to use a full tsp almond extract, 3/4 C cranberries, and 1 to 1 1/4 C pistachios. The cookies came out crunchy, full of flavor, yet not overly sweet - Wonderful. I had to make 2 batches because we kept snacking on them.

This recipies is sooo great (this is coming from someone who doesn't really care for cranberries).  It looks beautiful when sliced (red & green).  I will say make sure you follow directions and use a sharp serrated knife or else your cookies will crumble.. Don't bother using your hands to shape use a spoon and just shape as you desire (too sticky!).

This recipe is wonderful!  The cookies are so easy to make, but they look like they took all day.  They taste great too.  I crushed the pistachios a bit before I mixed them into the dough.  I figured it would make the cookies easier to slice, but I'm not sure if it made that much of a difference.  I only got about 1 1/2 dozen cookies out of one batch, but I'm not surprised because I never get the full yield out of a recipe anyway.  I'm a girl who likes a big cookie!

I just made this, and they were awesome!  The recipe calls for a generous amount of pistachio nuts, which makes all the difference.  My husband, who is a very critical eater, tried one and absolutely loved them.

I like this recipe because it uses olive oil instead of butter. I've made them using white chocolate chips or almonds instead of the pistachios. They turned out really well. I've also added cocoa to the recipe which also made for a nice biscotti.

Absolutely Wonderful!  I gave a peice to a person who does not like "sweets" and she declared it the best!  I used slivered almonds instead of pistachio's and I'm guessing that dried cherries would work well too.  I'm planning on making this again very soon!  Thanks a million.

Made this for my wife.  She took them to work.  Now understand she is an awesome cook and people rave over her cookies/candies.  Her boss however, being very health minded doesn't eat the sweets.  He and the office staff LOVE this recipe!!! I did cut the cranberries to 3/4 cup and the pistachio nuts to 3/4 cup whole nuts.  Then coursly chopped them.

I loved this recipe.  It is Bicotti for Italians and Jewish people will call it mandel bread.  Whatever you call it........it's DELICIOUS!  Pistachios w/shells made my finger sore so I also made another batch w/slivered almonds.  Cannot rave enough.  In my house it got a perfect 10!  Thanks!

These are great.  I noticed several reviews said too many pistacios and I looked at the amount and agreed.  I think it was a typo with 2 ones so it became 1 1/2 cups instead of what I used... just a 1/2 cup.  Also, when I recooked them 8-10 minutes after slicing I thought they still too soft so I left them in the oven about 10 more minutes.  Perfect.  I'll make it again, and will double the recipe for gift giving.  Looks festive for Christmas.

this was my first time making biscotti. i halved the recipe just to try it. i chopped the pistachios after reading the reviews, so they didn't turn out like the picture (mine were more green throughout and speckled with cranberries). i ran out of almond extract so added a teeny bit more vanilla. the biscotti were pretty big, so i'd make two smaller loaves instead of one next time. very crunchy and pistachio-y. =o) my boyfriend really liked them.

I made this recipe for x-mas and it was pretty simple, I had never attempted to make biscotti till now and this was pretty simple minus the shelling of the pistachios (the family helped) but it was very tasty and pretty to look at. Thanks for the great recipe, sonya

This recipe is every bit as good as it sounds.  I made them for the holidays and, not only did they look beautiful on my cookie trays, but they were a hit with everyone who tried them. Well worth the extra time it takes to shell the pistachios - thank you!

These were fantastic and so much easier than I expected! First time I made these was for a ladies group, and was recruited to make some for the civic league bake sale. I followed the recipe exactly and followed advice to cool them covered with a tea towel. I'll be making these for gifts!

I too am Italian-American second generation. I made 2 batches to celebrate Saint Joseph's Day on March 19th. One with 3/4 cup of pistachios because thats all I had and 3/4 cup of cranberries and the other with cocoa and 1.5 cup of milk chocolate chips. I made one log out of each and slightly flattened them and smoothed the edges out and mine did not spread out much. I baked them for 5 minutes more and let them cool for about 13 minutes because the  were larger. I pressed down to cut them until the end of the log got harder so i did saw it slightly to break through the crust and then pressed down. I did bake them until dry and flipped them over.  They are awesome and will be a staple for my Christmas baking too. Gratzie for this recipe!!!

I was rather disappointed with this recipe. The almond extract was way too overpowering.
I used sunflower oil because it has no flavor compared to olive oil. The texture of mine came out pretty nice, but a little soft and crumbly compared to other biscotti I’ve made. I’d like to try this recipe without the almond extract, but this was not a cheap fail and I don’t want to make the same mistake twice.

This was the first time I've ever made biscotti and I was thrilled with how well this turned out!  The only change I made was to coarsely chop the pistachios.  I will be making this again!

This is in the top three things that I have ever made. I followed the recipe exactly, though I omitted the salt because I used salted pistachios. The almond extract completes the flavor and I would make this again anytime.

This recipe tastes gourmet, and I highly recommend it. The only thing I do differently is used slivered almonds, mostly because they require no prep work and are easier to get (for me) than shelled pistachios.

YUM!  I made this recipe for my mother for Mother's Day.  She mentioned at Christmas time that she thought this would be something she would really like.  Life got in the way at Christmas but Mother's Day is going to catch her by surprise.  I gave it a taste test and it's a definite 5 stars!  Thank you Gerry Meyer for sharing your recipe!

I thought it was not only easy but delicious.  Then I added lemon and a drizzle of white chocolate with pecans for nuts.  I drizzled dark chocolate on the cranberry ones and they were so pretty in a tin for giving away and once I was right on the second bake they kept perfect in my tins until delivery!  Bravo!

Very delicious! With the cranberries and pistachios, I also added some cashews for a little more crunch. Came out wonderful! Not too sweet, nice and chewy, and very good with morning coffee! My first time making them and they came out wonderful! Instead of making two large logs, I just spread out the whole mixture like a cake in the pan and let it bake as one big piece. It came out perfectly, almost an inch thick and I cut it into 4 inch long slices. Great bite size cookie!

Recipe is perfect! Biscotti is wonderful... I replaced pistachios with almonds and added small chocolate chunks to the batter. They came out great and taste wonderful. I have also made them with almonds only and used Truvia instead of sugar for a diabetic-friendly recipe. Wonderful flavor. God Bless!

This recipe's ingredients don't need altered in any way.  It's wonderful and easy.  I baked them for 40 minutes, then let cool for 10 minutes with a towel over them, then uncovered for another 10.  Cut with a very sharp non-serrated knife.  No cracking or breaking.  Baked for 12 more minutes.  I think my Dad's going to like his Christmas gift!!

This was the first time I've tried making Biscotti.  Not only was this recipe extremely easy, it tasted amazing!  I used chopped pecans since that's what I had on hand, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  Everyone who tried it said it tasted better than the kind they had bought at those pricey coffee houses.  Next time I'll try it with chocolate drizzle or different types of nuts/fruit.  Thanks for a great recipe!

next time I will deff add more almond extract, I could barely taste any.
also I used canola instead of olive oil because that's what I had(also would think it would make me sense) 

I added more cranberries(craisins) and less pistacios.

really good tho!!!!

This is a great biscotti recipe. I love cranberries and my boyfriend loves pistachios, so this is great for both of us. I made this for a holiday potluck once and everyone wanted your recipe.

Optional:
*1Tbsp orange zest
*Almond slivers instead of pistachio
*Cover the rolls while cooling so it will cool down gradually to avoid cracking on top
*Don't saw the log. Just apply slight pressure on the knife while slicing.

It was a fight getting my biscotti into the oven... My husband and daughter  kept on pinching pieces while I was slicing  it.  I added a little grated orange rind some slivered almonds and not so much almond essence.  I'm giving 5 stars and they are not even out the oven yet... I don't much like the chances on them lasting too long!   My husband has just confirmed this!

Easy, light, crisp, delicious!  

I left out the salt as my pistachios were salted and I was really glad I did.  I also used 1/8 c olive and 1/8c veggie oil because I was concerned about it tasting ' olive oily'.  Came out fantastic and one of the easiest things EVER!

Great recipe. I didn't change anything although the next time I make it I may use less sugar. I used craisins and pecans and didn't measure. Great recipe. Great taste. Will definitely make it again.

I have made biscotti every year for the holidays and this is one of my favorites.  It comes out perfect every time and I make it exactly according to the recipe.  It is one of the few biscotti recipes that doesn't have chocolate in it but it stands on its own.  I give my biscotti out to family and friends and everyone raves about this one.

Have made this several times and its a keeper.I vary it with toasted pine nuts, toasted hazelnuts, dried tart cherries, a tweak of orange zest...you get the idea. My husband suggests minced garlic and I am not sure that he is kidding.

Best biscotti recipe I have tried. I had to adjust proportions of berries, nuts and extracts a bit, based on what I had, but they were still great. I did add quite a lot of time to the 2nd baking - I like a crisp biscotti. I may bake another batch tomorrow!

I replaced the pistachios with slivered almonds and it was delicious.  It was simple to make and the end product looked great.  I made a second batch replacing the nuts with chocolate chips and it was delicious too, but not as good.  I dipped them in melted chocolate and people said that it was better than any bakery.  Note: I had to bake longer than 10 minutes the second time for each batch because the biscotti would not dry.

These were the best biscotti I ever made! I only had extra virgin olive oil so I used part evoo and vegetable oil, did not affect the taste. I also used almonds instead of pistachios. This is now my biscotti recipe!

This biscotti came out great. I used the exact measurement of cranberry and pistachio as suggested by the recipe and feel like it was the perfect amount. I only had salted pistachios and was concerned that they would make the cookie too salty, so I rinsed them first. Next time I will not do that however, because I think the saltiness would have been nice. Because of the lack of saltiness, I felt like cookie needed something, so I mixed a little confectioners sugar with lemon juice and drizzled it over the biscotti. Looked very pretty and tasted better.

This recipe is awesome! To make it a little bit more Christmas-y, I used orange flavored cranberries and added a couple drops of  Balsam Fir Needle essential oil. It's like an Xmas O in your mouth ;) Everyone at work asked for the recipe.

Delicious and delightful biscotti! Tried making these years ago without great success and decided it was time to try again. This recipe came together beautifully and the add-in combinations are endless with such a great  and forgiving dough base. I like that these are made with pantry ingredients (except for the additions) so I was able to put it together with ease.  I did chill the dough for a bit and that seemed to take away much of the stickiness and I had to wet my hands often to form a good loaf. I used a serrated knife and had no problem with slicing. Be careful of the ends when slicing for they can 'chip off' but when I used an even and leveled sawing motion that stopped. Recipe yielded  only 13 cookies so I plan to make a couple more batches.

Thank you for this recipe!! It's great to try what seems to be an authentic biscotti recipe. The olive oil was an interesting addition and it seemed to work just fine. I really enjoyed this biscotti...and could really do multiple variations (almond extract, orange extract, different sorts of nuts). I chopped up raw almonds by hand and added just those into the batter along with vanilla extract. Drizzled afterwards with white chocolate. ALSO, I substituted yogurt for the two eggs, and it turned out just fine to my relief! About 4 oz. of yogurt and a little extra oil.  While I like this recipe, I feel it could use a little more baking powder to achieve a smooth look on the top of the logs so that the biscotti look more professional when cut. I also prefer my biscotti to have a little bit more body to them, which I feel the recipe "Spring Biscotti" achieves. I do really like this recipe, and appreciate that it is oil based and will have a different result than butter-based recipes. Thanks again!

Wow!  Amazing flavor, texture and presentation.  Pressing down with the knife was definitely easier than sawing the logs.  Cutting through the pistachios wasn't hard. Like many reviewers, I added 1/4 tsp orange extract, increased to 1 cup cranberries, and decreased to 1 cup pistachios.

Liked the idea of orange flavor but didn't have any extract so added half tsp of orange zest and chopped cranberries and pistachios with nutribullet emulsifier blade - turned out perfect!!!

We usually make these with sliced almonds instead of pistachios.  Use real almond extract; when made with imitation almond extract the flavor is not as good (taste olive oil rather than almond).

I tried this recipe 6 years ago and I have made it every Christmas since! I love it!! I have substituted whole toasted almonds in place of the pistachios, and have even drizzled with melted white chocolate chips! I wet my hands with cold water to make the logs. Karen, Orangeville, On

These are amazing!  I followed some other suggestions and added a few teaspoons of fresh orange zest. If you add it to the liquid ingredients, it will incorporate nicely.  I also made another type of biscotti at the same time, and this one was easier and tastier by far!- Mammaw

Prepared these EXACTLY as recipe stated today and I will make them again and again (mostly as gifts; they are that good).  My husband and I sampled the ends and he was very pleasantly surprise (I wasn't surprised!).  Upon removal from the oven initially, I did cover them with a kitchen towel as one reviewer suggested and had no cracking at all.  Thanks to other reviewers, I did the "put your weight into it when you cut" without a serrated knife and walla--perfecto!  From me and some of my Christmas recipients, I thank you for this recipe!! Sometime I will try it with dried blueberries, almonds, and anise flavoring (my husband's favorite).

This recipe produces delicious biscotti and the pistachios give them a rich, nutty flavour!  The only adjustments I made were substituting canola oil for the light olive oil, and adding more than the recommended 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract - I added two teaspoons as I prefer them to have that extra taste of almond.  Thanks for the recipe.

One of my favorite recipes, and everyone I give them to loves them! Even those who claim not to like biscotti - this one won them over! The nuts and cranberries go together perfectly. The dough is definitely sticky, so absolutely keep some cold water handy to dip your fingers in - works great. Also, I only use about a cup of pistachios otherwise there are just too many. Fantastic recipe overall!

These were wonderful. I made them for a pot luck and they were a huge hit. I don't like a lot of store bought biscotti because they are as hard as bricks so I was worried when I picked this recipe but these had a great texture.

Easy to follow and a nice texture. Made it for office cookie exchange and received several compliments. I had also drizzled white chocolate over these and let them set before packaging them for presentation.

WOW I am amazed how wonderful and easy these are to make.  I did allow to cool for 20 minutes before slicing and then put back in the oven for 9 more minutes.  I used chopped almonds and anise flavoring  with a little orange zest!

Made them exactly according to recipe.
The only thing I found was that in my oven, they seemed to require quite a bit more time than asked for in the recipe.

Add 1 tbsp of orange zest.  Bake for 25 mins at 350.  Make score with serrated knife and then go back with straight edge.  Use wet hands to form logs.

These were the best biscotti I myself ever made. I only used about 3/4 cup of pistachios but next time I would up that to the full amt or at least 1 cup. (I coursely chopped the pistachios and had no trouble slicing the loaves).  I used 1/2 cup cranberries as in the recipe but,I would increase that slightly also by about 1/4 cup.  Otherwise the taste and texture were excellent.  Also I dipped the tops in chocolate and as we all know, chocolate only makes good things even better.

This was my first attempt at Biscotti.  I am sure that with a bit more practice, my cutting technique will improve!  This Biscotti has WONDERFUL flavor!  I am so glad I tried it...I took it to work as we had a cookie exchange, and it was gone before I could say cranberry pistachio biscotti!

Easy to make, few ingredients and was loved by all at the cookie exchange. I did add 1/2 tsp of orange extract, doubles the cranberries and replaced pistachios with almonds.

Wonderful biscotti recipe. Have made it the last two Christmas' and is always a big hit. Have used dried cherries in it as well as the dried cranberries. Really like the way these don't dry out too much Taste very good alone or dipped in hot beverages.

Made this and it's great. I did not have a problem cutting through it with a serrated knife, just push down instead of sawing through it, comes out clean. I am going to try it with orange zest/extract tomorrow for a new batch.. cant wait! Thanks!

I tried this recipe after having a pistachio & cranberry biscotti from the local bakery and it was just as good! It has become one of my favorite recipes. I came across some bags of fruit & nut trail mix on sale and used them with the same results - excellent!

Super easy, and SO delish! I followed  the suggestion and laid a towel over the loafs when they come out of the oven the first time so that they cool a bit slower and that worked great! I also used a non-serrated knife and I had no trouble slicing the loafs. The loafs to puff up a bit while cooking, so allow extra space between them so that they don't run together. I followed the recipe to a "T" and they turned out great!

Made these for our New Year's eve party so people could take home little tins of biscotti.  Everyone loved them - even the men.  Some friends who travel to Rome every year said they were wonderful.  Definitely recommend.

excellent.  i didn't have any problems w/ the biscotti cracking.  although it came out a bit more chewy than crunchy.  flavor is excellent!  will def make it again but will put in a couple of more minutes in the oven before taking it out to cool.  i was able to use a serrated knife to saw through it w/o crumbling.  i used almond since i didn't have any pistachios in the house.  excellent!

I've never made biscotti before, but the pictures were lovely and I thought it might make nice holiday token gifts.    I followed the recipe exactly, but did have to add about 5 minutes baking time on the second baking.  It was very simple, except for shelling the pistaschios.  It is wonderful.  Better yet, my spouse, thought it tasted just like something his  Nona would make, and she immigrated from Italy when she was young.   I can't wait get get more sugar and pistaschios and make a few more batches!

GREAT cookie - Texture & taste are wonderful Easy to make - used the suggestion of rolling onto a Pam sheet of wax paper to shape the logs.  Found cutting the 2nd log easier by  cutting the log down the center and then into slices.  Slices were more even - Looks very holidayish!  This is a keeper.

I've never made Biscotti  before, but I just wasn't impressed with these. They were soft on the inside and crisp on the outside, but I literally have chunks of biscotti because slicing them was a disaster! I put a dish towel over top as recommended to keep it from cracking and it still cracked even before I started cutting. I found that just pressing through it with a knife did NOT work. I had to saw through the crisp layer on the outside and then press my knife through the rest of it. I'm thrilled with the idea of making a biscotti, but this just didn't fit the bill. I'm going to tweek it a little bit in the future, but for now I'm just a little frustrated with mediocre results for all the work I put into them.    Thanks anyway.

Fantastic!  I made a few modifications:  used dried cherries instead of cranberries, 1 tsp of vanilla, 1/4 tsp orange extract & 2 tsp of Malibu Rum, dipped sides in white chocolate and sprinkled with red colored sugar.  They are so pretty and delicious!  DEFINITELY keep your fingers wet with cold water when working with this dough.  Makes life so much easier  :-)  This is a year-round keeper!

These are very good, but I think I will try them with butter next time.  I can literally taste the olive oil.  I did dip half of each cookie in white chocolate and drizzled with dark chocolate - which elevates the taste from good to very good and the presentation is fantastic.

Excellent!  This was my first biscotti and I've made it several times now.  I've tried dried blueberries with pecans, dried pinapple with macadamias.  Love the fruit and nut combo in a not so sweet cookie.  The only thing hard is knowing how to get this sticky stuff on the cookie sheet : )

This was AWESOME. i had some doubts at first because most recipes state to bake at 350 degrees but This recipe said 300 but after 35~37 minutes of baking, it looked and tasted fine.  I used sliced almonds since thats what i had,add 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips, and zest of 1 orange. Next time i will use pistachios for the more festive look of red&green. Baked 6 minutes on each side for the second bake. Thought they weren't "dry" enough but when cooled, its PERFECT! Drizzled half with semisweet chocolate and the other half left as is.  Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Im not sure if this is to the fault of the recipe and the use of olive oil instead of butter, but I had a problem with the batter being too thin, I had to add more flour so it didnt run off my cookie sheet. I did use others suggestions and chopped the cranberries but I dont think that would have made the batter thin out. Other than that the taste was wonderful.

I love this recipe.  I brought them home last Christmas, and my Mom started dropping hints that I should bring them more often.  :)  I didn't have any pistachios, so I just went with the cranberries.  Amazing!  I love the olive oill so much.

Great cookie-crisp texture, and totally easy to make.  Used unsalted roasted pistachios and added blood orange essence so that the cookies would go with Italian dessert wine, yum!  Didn't have light olive oil so I used about 90% canola and 10% fruity olive oil.  Baked for 35 mins, had no problems at all cutting the cookies, then baked on cooling racks for 10 minutes each side.  Perfect!

I have been making this during the holidays to add to cookie plates for about 5 years.  I have never made this with pistachios, only with pecans (my favorite).  It is always good.

I didn't quite get the hard biscotti texture. It rose slightly and tasted a bit like a cookie. The problem might be the density of the olive oil used. I'll try a lighter olive oil next time.

I made these for an event at our church last night and they flew off of the table.  I did have to add about another cup of flour in order to get the logs to hold their shape but the flavor/texture/ease of this recipe will make it a 'go to' recipe for me in the future.

Wow, who would have thought I could make biscotti at home.  I just took them out of the oven and the crumbs tasted devine!  I know the cookie will be perfect.  I made some changes (only to make it lower in fat) and they still turned out perfect.  I used 1/8 c. olive oil and 2 tblspn reduced fat margarine.  I used Egg Beaters for the 2 eggs.  I only used about 1/2 cup slivered almonds.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  Be sure to have a bowl of ice water next to the sheet pan to dip your hands in as the dough is extremely sticky.

Extremely easy to make! The dough was difficult to handle, so definitely dip your hands in cold water to make it easier. I cooked them for exactly 35 minutes and they and came out perfect! They're not too sweet, not too crunchy... just perfect! Will definitely make again!

I made these exactly as presented and they turned out perfectly.  I do suggest to spend the bit extra and get the pre-shelled nuts though cause shelling all those nuts made the recipe not as enjoyable.

Wow! Absolutely amazing.  I don't like cranberries, so I used the recipe more for the general biscotti base than anything else. I used chocolate chips and almonds instead, and it was amazing!  I'm definitely going to be making this and packaging it for birthday presents and so forth. Thanks so much!

This was super easy to make and very very tasty!  I love that this isn't just a winter cookie - it's so light and the cranberries are so fruity you can make this year round.  This is one of my favorites!

i made this five times this past christmas season. none of the batches lasted more than a day... if my family didn't eat it while it was still hot it was brought to a neighbour's house where it quickly disappeared. it's also fantastic with salted almonds in place of the pistachios and a little bit of orange zest in the batter.

This biscotti has a great flavor.  I used almonds instead of pistachios because it's what I had on hand and it turned out great.

These are simply delicious and very festive with the red/green for the holidays.  Dough was very easy to work with.  I drizzled melted white chocolate over one side to bring them to the next level.  Received many compliments and requests for the recipe.

Wow! Another recipe that is sure to become a tradition. I followed the recipe exactly and it was so amazingly good! Great for gift giving. The cold water for the hands works great (I tired it without and it was a mess). The only problem I had was that it was a bit crumbly when I cut it but I didn't have a serated knife so that could be why. This is one of few recipes that I print off as I know it will be requested! 

MANY MANY THANKS! It is perfect as is.

Best Holiday Recipe EVER!  I make this every year and I always get rave reviews.  Make sure to wet your hands well when shaping the sticky dough.  I use about 1/2 cup less of pistachios and 1/4 cup more of cranberries.  I also make sure to chop the pistachios roughly before they go into the dough.  Love this recipe!

First time to make biscotti.  This is a real tasty and easy recipe.  The pistachio with cranberry are so good together.  Make it for yourself or for gifts.  It ships well, too.

So tasty! I used macadamia nuts since I had them in the fridge. I also used about 1/4 cup more flour and a pich more baking powder. Think I cut them big as they took longer the second bake but they were worth it. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

The taste of these was excellent and a friend said they were the best biscotti she ever tasted. A few comments as I did follow the recipe exactly>
1) I think the texture was more like a cookie than drier like biscotti.
2) I also am not sure how they came out with 36 servings, I was thinking more like the big, thin biscotti you get at the coffee houses and came up with maybe 20. 
3) I had operational issues where they seemed to crumble when I sliced them.
4) I saw this recipe somewhere else and drizzled melted chocolate chips over them per that recipe, which was a lovely addition.

I will try this again.

Wonderful flavour super easy and the only reason I gave it a 4 * is because I ended cooking another 10 minutes on top of the 8 minutes. Drizzled with dark and milk chocolate(Didn't have white) and plain would be just as good!

This recipe was great!  Very easy to make and the dough came out beautifully.  I wanted to add some amaretto liqueur but didn’t have any on hand so I used 2 teaspoons coconut rum liqueur instead.  That gave it a wonderful flavor!  Also I doubled everything and it made about three or four dozen.  I used almonds instead of pistachio nuts and did a cup of nuts and cup of dried cranberries.  They tasted great and were very soft for biscotti!

I love this recipe!!  My regular recipe "Cantucci Biscotti," on this site has no added fat but are almost too crispy.  I like that this is more cookie-like in texture while still having only healthy fats.  I can taste the olive oil, and was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed that!  I eliminated the almond extract, adding more vanilla, used pine nuts along with the others, and used whole wheat flour.

This was so easy to make and a huge hit.  I followed others suggestions and added more cranberries, substituted walnuts for pistachios and added a handful of vanilla chips.  Also, baked slices 8 minutes on each side to get them drier.

This was my first attempt to make biscotti and they were GREAT. I didn't have a very good knife, you need a really sharp one to cut these to look pretty. But looks aside, they were delish!

Yum. My favorite biscotti ever. I used same amount pistachios as cranberries and loved it. Refrigerating dough before trying to handle it definitely made it easier to handle. My kids and I love them with our tea! Thanks for the great recipe.

So easy and sooo yummy. The olive oil flavour comes through which is a suprisingly nice balance to the cranberries and pistachios.  I use a generous 3/4 c of each, which I find to be the perfect amount.

Fantastic!
Used almonds instead of pistachios.  The olive oil was "pure olive oil" and not the extra "light"... came out absolutly fine.  Very impressive to guests who asked to take some home!

I made this recipe just to see if I could make biscotti...it turned out so well, my family wolfed down half of the batch and the rest went as a Christmas gift to my neighbors. I will try the 1 to 1 cup ratio of pistachios to cranberries next time as suggested. Thank you for posting, I will make it again!

Followed the recipe pretty much exactly. Super delicious and very pretty. I used 1 cup each of cranberries and pistachios and found that to be a perfect amount.

My favorite part of this recipe is that it is full of "meat."  I prefer the full fruit flavor.  They're really delicious and a perfect festive treat around Christmas time.

Easy to make, Low fat, Beautiful presentation, Delicious!  This is a win-win recipe.  I made them exactly as written. One suggestion: Hide some for yourself because there will be NONE left once the guests get hold of them.  I have proof!

Fantastic. Even the crumbs are great. I have never made biscotti before but this was extremely easy. I followed the recipe as listed except used 1 cup of pistachios and chopped them, 1 cup of orange flavoured dried cranberries, and added 1 cup of white chocolate chips. the dough was very stiff and sticky so definately use a sturdy mixing spoon. Also wet hands were much better than oiled to form the logs. ... Enjoy

A wonderful cookie recipe in every way ... looks great, tastes great and is simple to make. No need to deviate from this recipe in anyway. It is a great addition to the Christmas cookie list since it is a little different and a favorite with Starbucks fans....

I was really worried when I got to mixing the dough cuz it was SUPER sticky (be sure to follow the directions of wetting your hands with cold water) and it looked gunky and wrong when I placed it on the cookie sheet. Baked for ~30 mins (looked for color more than time), let it cooled for abt 5-7 mins, cut it, and wow, I was amazed! Looked professional, but tastes better (I like them softer). Will definitely make again using different nutz/fruit combo (I used almonds only for this).

I have made these a couple of times now with pistacios and pecans.  The cold water trick absolutly works to keep dough from sticking to hands.  Wonderful both times and a big hit in my family. I will continue to make again and again.

This is THE recipe for biscotti! I used more cranberries and almonds instead of pistacio, then I drizzled white chocolate over them once they had all cooled. Oh so good! You could use any combination you like. I also agree that it takes much longer than 8 min. for them to dry out at the end. Great recipe, I will use over and over!

Great recipe!  I was looking for a basic biscotti recipe when I saw this one, and thought I would try it instead.  I didn't have pistachios on hand, so I used a bag of dried cranberries and slivered almonds that I had to put in salads (I think it is called Salad Pizazz).  Also, if you use a serrated knife and cut the logs in slices while  they are still slightly warm, it will minimize the tops cracking.  Yum!

This is my new 'signature' cookie around the holidays.  Everyone RAVES about it.  I have to decrease the pistachios a little in order for it to stay together better, but it is a FANTASTIC recipe!  Good job!

I didnt have any pistachios so i used almonds. this was very flavorful but a lot softer than usual biscotti recipes. i had to add a bit of milk when i had mixed in the flour as it was very dry, but just a splash.

This recipe was wonderful...and now a couple of notes.  Firstly, the dough is very sticky, so be sure to wet your hands thoroughly to handle the dough.  Also, if you use salted pistachios it makes the biscotti quite salty.  I balanced this by dipping the sides in melted white chocolate.  They were so yummy like that and had the salty/sweet mix that everyone loves.

This recipe is awesome. Right now my 9th batch in 1 week is in the oven. I’m told they are the best by several different people. I followed the recipe exactly, except for the nut/cranberry ratio, I did 1 cup of each also. This is my first attempt at biscotti and I’m very pleased with the results. I started with the pistachios, but they are a pain to shell. Almonds work great, I suggest grinding them up it makes cutting the loafs easier. Good luck!!!

This is an excellent and very pretty biscotti. I added a touch more flour (slightly less than 2 cups total) and I agree original recipe has too many pistachios, I put in a scant one cup and it was PLENTY. I rough chopped the cranberries. My dough was not as runny as others have described and i had no trouble forming into loaves. This is very very good and easier than some biscotti recipes. Oh, I got 18 decently sized cookies, defintely nowhere near 3 dozen, but the recipe seems easy to double/triple. Highly recommend this!

Thanks Gerry for a great recipe.  I ran out of pistachios so I subed sliced almonds.  I  used 1Tsp. Vanilla, 1Tsp. Almond and 1 Tsp. of butter flavoring and I  increased the cranberries to 1C. As some noted this dough is sticky so I used a Med. size ice cream scooper to put the dough onto the parchment covered cookie sheet.  Be sure to use the scooper that has the wire that sweeps across the bottom of the scoop. It really worked great.

I used extra-virgin olive oil, and the olive oil taste was over-powering, but my friends enjoyed them very much.  I'll try with canola next time.

These turned out great.  I added a few tbsp of cranberry schnapps for some extra cranberry flavor and they tasted really good.  Thanks, Gerry.

Absolutely yummy! I advise doubling it if you want to give any as gifts or have leftovers. It only makes about two dozen per recipe. As for the recipe, I only used two cups of pistachios and still had tons in the cookies. I also used about a half cup of cranberries. I drizzled the finished cookies with white chocolate. It made them extra scrumptious.

Best of all the other biscotti recipes on here (well I tried a plain biscotti and the brownie one as well). The texture and extra sweetness from the cranberries & pistachios are a perfect combination.

I'm another first-time biscotti maker and I couldn't be more satisfied with the results.  The only change I might be inclined to make would be to use equal amounts of pistachios and cranberries.  But even as is, they are excellent.  If you have to shell your own pistachios, be prepared to add an hour to your prep time.  It takes a long time to shell a cup and a half of nuts!

These are the best. My friend came over and we doubled the recipe to give out to friends and neighbors. They look so pretty and taste wonderful. We did end up melting white chocolate too and dipped one side. I could not believe the response we got from everyone. They look like Starbuck quality and taste like it too. These will be on my Christmas cookie list forever.

Man! Are these good. I used salted, dry-roasted pistachios and forgot to omit the salt, and they're still awesome. I had some misgivings because the batter is quite sloppy, but sure enough, they turned out great! A definite keeper recipe for a old standard with a little extra umph!

This one is hard to rate.It was very easy and looked nice.I drizzeled with chocolate.This was for a cookie exchange and with the rave reviews I was sure it would be great but it was just so so on taste.Some bites were good, other bites were bland.This is missing something.

Really good recipe!  This was the first time I ever made biscotti and it turned out great!  These are sooo good with tea or coffee!  I used whole almonds instead of the pistachios...I would not recommend this as they were difficult to cut through and were not crisp in the middle.  Slivered almonds might be a better substitute. Thanks!

This biscottie recipe never fails to receive rave reviews...even people who don't like biscotti like it.  I always double the Almond extract and to make a festive change I add red & green sprinkles to the dough instead of cranberries.

I've been throwing out many BAD cookies lately. I made a batch of these yesterday and LOVED them. I made a second batch today. The only change I made was that I gave the exterior an egg wash with the yolk of an egg for shine and color. I will make these every year! My friend is a pastry chef and said that they were superb.

These are so delicious.  I accidentially added too much vanilla extract, but they still came out great.  I put these in clear bags and tied ribbon and bells around them to give out during the holidays last year.  People loved them.

Soo good! I have never made biscotti before and I was extremely impressed with this recipe! I did use pecans instead and when I found out that I didnt have any more almond extract, I added some orange zest. Overall, this is a great recipe that I plan on keeping!

One of the best recipes I have tried from this website. I made these for Christmas to give to friends. Everyone enjoyed them. The mix of flavors from the cranberries and the pistachios create a perfect combination. I tried other nut and fruit combos with this same recipe, but the original recipe is best.

I've actually made this DOZENS of times- and I have never actually used pistachios. You can swap out walnuts or almonds with ease. This is SUCH a simple, amazing recipes. I have often made it and gifted them to people- and they ALWAYS want to know the recipe. Keep this one, folks.

This was delicious!  The slightly sweet and slight salty combination is so good.  The flavors of cranberry and pistachio complement each other perfectly.  It did need quite a bit longer in the oven than the recipe says....but it came out so great!

We used these for one of the refreshments at a Christmas program, so they were more of a mini size. They were great! They weren't baked quite as long, so they had a little chew rather than being totally crunchy, which I preferred...delicious!

I substituted sweetened dried cherries for the cranberries. The result was great both ways. Definitely a keeper.

Everyone who has tried these loves them!  My 19-year-old daughter and I made these at her request 4 days ago.  My intention was to give 1/2 of the batch to my father, who is coming over today, but there aren't any left!  A group of her and my  17-year-old son's friend devoured them last night.  Therefore, my 15-year-old son and I are making a second batch now.

Made this today and it was very easy and turned out perfectly.  I coated my hands with cornstarch (lightly) rather than water and it worked well. I also chopped the pistachios and cranberries so that they were a bit finer in texture. Delicious!

This recipe is an absolute winner. It's super easy to make and it's delicious. I've been making it every Christmas now for 3 years and friends/family are now requesting it in advance. 

Some observations from my own experience:

1) it is VERY sticky. the recipe says to mix the cranberries and pistachio in with your hands but I used a spatula and found it much easier. It also helped when I split the dough in half in the bowl and transferred it to the silicon sheet/parchment paper on the cookie sheet to form the logs.  I was able to use nearly all of the dough using this method, too, because I didn't have as much stuck to my hands.

2) After the 1st baking phase and after allowing the logs to rest for 10 min, I carefully transferred the logs to a cutting board to avoid tearing/cutting the parchment paper/silicon.

3) This year, I ran low on pistachios and had a lot of cranberries so I matched the amount to 1 cup each instead of 1.5 c pistachios and .5 cup cranberries.  I will likely do that again as it turned out very well with more sweetness and still the lovely pistachio flavor/appearance.

4) After the 2nd bake time, I turn the oven off and leave the completed biscotti in it as it cools. This gives it an additional bit of crunch without the rock hard texture that store-bought biscotti often has.

This is fabulous biscotti as written. The only change I made is I toast whole almonds and cut them into broken pieces to put in the cookies in place of the pistachios. 
I found out in Italy that biscotti is supposed to be made with Olive Oil NOT butter, margarine or other fats.
If your cookies taste too strongly of olive oil, get a "light' olive oil  and it will be good.

I changed this up a little and used less pistachio's, approx 3/4 cup.  I also used 1.5tsp of almond extract to get more almond flavor and less of the vanilla.  Instead of cranberries I used dried cherries which makes it sweeter, but I liked it!

The combination of cranberry and pistachio is really delicious! I followed Toni Lee's advice and made the following adjustments: 1/3 C vegetable oil, 1/4 t cinnamon, 2 cups flour, 1 cup each dried cranberries and pistachios, chopped. I haven't made biscotti for a long time, but the water trick for handling the dough was genius--thanks to whoever suggested that! I haven't decided whether to add a chocolate dip, but this seems to be a really good recipe to experiment with.

Wow, the easiest and best biscotti recipe I have ever made. I did add a little more flour, about 1/8 cup. as the batter was too thin. I used the light olive oil so there is no olive oil flavor as some stated. I will be dipping in Ghirardelli white chocolate. Great recipe and will make again.
An a separate note this is my second try after using a different recipe last week that fell apart yet had this expensive melted white chocolate . If this happens to you then break up the biscotti crumbled and mixed into the white chocolate and spread out on a cookie sheet using a Silpat or paper and this makes a great biscotti bark. I sprinkled green and red sugar on it. Delish!!!

First time making and tasting biscotti.  I LOVE it!   I did do as some suggested and added some orange oil, only because I absolutely love orange. I also let it cool longer as some suggested and instead of sawing, used a sharp big knife and sliced.  I had no problem slicing it.  This was so good I immediately made another batch to give as part of my gift baskets for the holidays. Thank you so much for this recipe.

I baked this but substituted vegetable oil for olive oil. Not fond of olive oil in sweets.  I will make them again but will press down logs to about 1/2 inch as they did not spread much while baking and resulting biscotti were on the small side. But, less guilt when eating!

The recipe is delicious. I suggest using half the amount of pistachios. The batter is stiff, so be aware it may be a challenge to mix. I loved it so much, I made a second batch.

I have been making this every Christmas for years now. It is hands down my favorite biscotti. It is not dry and crumbly. I did not change a thing. It’s perfect. I am getting ready to make a couple of batches to bring to a cookie swap tomorrow.

So easy to make. I have this as my go to Christmas recipe for gifts. Can exchange cranberries for dried apricots and pistachio for almonds.

My first attempt at biscotti ever - what a success!  Followed the recipe exactly, and everyone loved 'em! Didn't have any of the parchment paper, so I just sprayed a cookie sheet with olive oil spray and didn't have any problem with it sticking to the sheet.
Next time I think I"ll leave out the cranberries - just a personal preference.

Made this at least 5 times now and it’s still the best biscotti recipe around. For personal taste, I reduce the cranberries and add more pistachios. Changed nothing else.

Absolutely sensational! A friend of mine posted this recipe on FB tonight, and after scanning through it, I realised I had all the ingredients to make a half batch.  My impatience was rewarded handsomely -  this is the easiest biscotti recipe, which yields a crisp, barely sweet biscuit that really hits the spot.

Made just as the recipe says to.  These are fantastic.  This time I added an Amaretto glaze to the top once they cooled a bit.  Took a perfect cookie and made it even better.

Thank you

I made this to take to a coffee time at church and so I couldn’t add the nuts. It still tasted wonderful. After the logs were cut into individual cookies I upped the temp from 275° (as directed) to 300° and turned them over every 10 minutes. It took about 40-50 minutes to get them browned. After they were browned I drizzled white chocolate over them. Look great and tasted yummy. Next time I’ll add pistachios or even almonds would taste great. This took some time to bake but was easy to make.

Delicious! I substituted sunflower oil for then olive oil and dried cherries for the cranberries. Also half of the batter I added toasted almonds instead of pistachios. Both were great. Very easy to make and easier to eat !

I made a huge mistake of 1/2 batching this recipe last week , because they are delicious & gone extremely fast . I sent them along with my husband for his crew & my son even  loved them ( who is very picky ) . I'm making more today and I'm going to double batch them . They have such a good flavor with the salty from the pistachio & sweetness from the cranberries. I did not see to leave out the salt if using the nuts & it still was great .

Very good. But, similar to other comments, I found this needed a little more flour than called for (I used 2 cups). I also evened out the nuts to cranberry ratio to 3/4 cups each and I used vegetable instead of olive oil. I like to dunk my biscotti in coffee, so I don't think I'm as much of a fan of the nuts and fruits as I am of just a solid cookie - that's just a personal preference,  but these flavours do go nicely together.

I make this biscotti during the holidays, exactly as stated in the recipe.  It is perfect in every way.  I package it up and give it as gifts and people look forward to it every year.  I have made a ton of biscotti in my life and this is the best recipe I have ever used.

I should have left them in the oven a little longer but the taste was great. I drizzled the biscotti with dark chocolate which I really liked.

Great Biscotti Recipe- I made 4 batches at different times during the holidays for gifts, they were very well received and most requested the recipe.  Besides the great taste they look very festive with the pistachios & cranberries.  The only change I made to them was to rough cut the whole pistachios and chop the cranberries (not too much, more like half their size).

I love pistachios and made this recipe for the first time without ever having made biscotti before.  I thought they were difficult to do, but they are actually easy....these were delicious!  So beautiful and professional looking.  I gave some to friends who loved them too!  Delicious with a cup of coffee or tea.  Give a try.  The dough is sticky and a bit messy to form into loaves, but the rest is very simple.  I am really glad I tried this recipe.

I made these today with almonds and chopped up dried apricots and added 1 tsp. ground fennel.  I did not have almond extract.  The flavor is good, but the dough was really, really dry.  Not sure why.  I followed others who said to refrigerate the dough for 5 minutes.  I think I made mine too tall and not long enough.They did not spread at all.  I covered with a towel to prevent cracking, but there were already cracked from in the oven. I had to bake them longer due to how tall they were.  I will try again when these are gone.

I never thought making biscotti would be this easy! This is a wonderful recipe. I wanted to add orange zest but had no oranges. I added a small drop of Wild Orange Doterra essential oil and it worked out really well. I cut these into slices after cooling for 10 minutes. They didn’t crumble much at all. These will be made frequently in our home!! Thank you for the recipe!

I didn't have pistachios on hand, so used unsalted green pumpkin seeds instead. I dipped each biscotti in white chocolate and served them at a family Christmas party and they went fast! Will definitely make these again!

What a great recipe and the video made it so much easier. Yes biscotti is easy and delicious.
I used 'toasted almonds' instead of pistachios due to an allergy ... wonderful.
I'm not sure if  anyone has mentioned this, but I chopped toasted almonds and pressed them lightly into the top of the logs before baking.
Thank you for the new Christmas tradition for gifting.

I had always shied away from making biscotti as it seemed fussy to make. This recipe could not be easier. I really think the 3:1 ratio of pistachios to cranberries is best as the cranberries can easily overwhelm the more delicate pistachios. The only change I made was needing 2 1/4 cups of flour to get the right consistency. The result is just a perfect cookie!

I dipped the biscotti in white chocolate to make a festive red, green, and white Christmas cookie but it really was superfluous flavor-wise. But they sure were pretty.

I love these biscotti! You really can't mess them up and I've made lots of variations of this recipe. I dipped them in melted white chocolate. I use pecans & caramel chips, or walnuts and chocolate chips, all are great!

I've made these several times and they always come out lovely. I usually replace the cranberries with dried cherries, reduce the sugar by 1/4 cup or even a little more, add lemon or orange zest. Sometimes I also replace the pistachios with mini chocolate chips. Excellent!

I've never made biscotti before so this was my first attempt.
Amazing... Easy...and Delicious!
They turned out so well I took them to work as a Christmas 'treat' for our installers (I work at a renovation firm) for their morning coffee.
To say the whole company loved them is an understatement, and wow were they ever impressed with me! LOL.
I plan on making several more batches this weekend for my family as Christmas presents. 
Thank you for a great recipe!

very sticky.  I worn disposable gloves and dampened them which made the dough easier to handle than just dampening my hands.  excellent taste therefore I didn't want to change anything in the recipe.

This was GREAT! I followed a suggestion on a previous review and substituted the almond extract for orange. It was amazing. The first batch I made I cut a little too thick and they were more chewy than crunchy, the second batch I made I cut them more evenly and about 1” thick and they were perfect. I highly recommend this biscotti recipe.

The recipe is easy and makes lots of biscotti at least 24,  I shared the bake with others and one person I gave six to ate them all before I noticed she had done that.  She then told me they were better than others she'd bought and if I make some more to remember her again.  I liked the texture  (more of a biscuit than cake)and flavor better, not too sweet or overpowering that I could dunk the biscotti in coffee and taste every delicious ingredient and the coffee.

Dough is very sticky! Definitely use cool water on your hands when forming the loaves. I added way more whole pistachios and swapped cranberries for dried apricots. Also put in more than required but I like chunky biscotti.

This is a delicious biscotti!  I find that I must add a little more flour to move it from the "batter" category to "dough".  Also, the baking times are way too low.  Another review mentioned raising the initial bake temp to 325 or 350 but at 300 it needs another 5 minutes.  Remember, after the first bake it is not a finished product so don't shoot for a golden brown top - it will be pale but it should be firm.  Cut with a very sharp, long knife - one swift cut per slice, no sawing back and forth.  Place the pieces upright space slightly apart so that they will bake on all sides.  The goal is a dry, firm cookie.  I find that at 275, I need to bake an additional 20 minutes to obtain the desired doneness.  If not very firm, they risk breaking/crumbling.  A drizzle of white chocolate makes for the most amazing holiday treat!

I made a little change in this because I have made Scandinavian Almond Bar cookies and wanted a different note for the biscotti. I had made one batch according to recipe and like them enough to just modify the kind of  liquid and to add a spice. Instead of adding vanilla and almond extracts I substituted in the same amount Fiori di Sicilia from King Arthur Flour which is citrus and vanilla combined. Though spice is not in the recipe I added 1 tsp. of cardamom too. My husband and I both prefer this version.

I've got a few biscotti recipes and decided to try this one after seeing it in my All Recipes magazine.  
It's good.  It's very good but falls short of perfection.
The first batch, I followed almost to a tee--substuting the olive oil for grapeseed oil which was fine as a find olive oil to be a bit heavy.
My issue is the timing of cooling.  In order to get a cleaner cut, the cookies really need to cool for about a half hour.  Cutting them while even slightly warm will affect having a clean cut.
For the second batch, I cut the oil and use half butter and half oil then baked in a 350 oven and cooled the biscotti for a half hour before the second bake.  The second bake I just stood the cookies up so I didn't have to flip and baked for twenty minutes.  The second batch turned out much better.
Overall, it's a good recipe.  Thank you for this recipe.

Absolutely amazing! I used salted pistachios which took it up a level! I’ve been making these for a few years and finally felt compelled to leave a review. If you’re looking for a perfect biscotti, this is it! By the way, the dough is sticky to work with just keep wetting your hands.

I added orange extract to the recipe.  Also baked longer than specified.  I use light olive oil for many biscottis I have made and never had a bad taste.   The recipe makes a great biscotti.

Next time I would bake the logs longer than 35 minutes as they seemed too undercooked. I'm still trying to crisp them up at the lower temp. I cut them with my metal kitchen scraper and it made a nice clean cut. The recipe said to cut on the diagonal which I did with success. However, your video does not show a diagonal cut.  I think also next time I will cut them to 1/2 in. pieces so they will crisp up better.

After I combined all the ingredients I thought the mixture was too thick and couldn't combine thoroughly, I knew I would be disappointed in the outcome.   What a wonderful surprise when the Apple Bread was moist and very tasty.  Yes, I will make this again!

I made some small adjustments that perhaps didn't work well.  I used half sugar/half baking stevia.  Instead of all pistachio, used part pistachio and part walnut.  My logs did not spread much at all and I ended up with miniature biscotti.  Not a big deal, but it was not what I was expecting.  Maybe using the baking stevia took up more liquid than regular sugar?  I'll try again with all sugar and see how it goes.  They are good size for a cookie, but not what I'd call biscotti.

This is my first ever biscotti and really happy with the results. Great texture and taste. Love the sour and the sweet. It's not too hard. I followed the recipe as stated but did rough chop the pistachios and the cranberries.  I used extra light olive oil and I think that it necessary. You can't use regular olive oil.  Otherwise just use vegetable oil. Definitely making this again. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is good for proportions and timing, but I thought it lacked much flavor.  I did add about a tsp of orange zest - should have done more like 2+ tsp. I will make it again, but will think about how to bump up the flavor.

Excellent. Sugar and pistachios can easily be reduced to 3/4. Flour a mix of white and whole grain. The grated orange zest and orange extract add a sublime flavor. Great recipe, very easy and quick.

This is absolutely the best Biscotti on the planet.  I have made it exactly as stated in the recipe and it's awesome.  Sometimes however, I make it with a mix of nuts (cashews, almonds, pecans, walnuts) and no cranberries.  Any way I make it, I always make a double recipe as it seems to disappear quite quickly.  It freezes beautifully and thaws quickly so I usually keep (hide) it in the freezer and take out one or two pieces each night to have with a cup of tea.  I have been making this recipe for many years and it's an all time favourite.

So delicious!! I made it exactly as the recipe stated and it turned out perfect! The dough was quite sticky, but getting your hands wet with cold water as the direction suggest worked great. I added a drizzle of melted almond bark to make it look extra pretty.

Used pecans and dried cranberries.  Used half brown sugar and half granulated.  Didn’t have oil so used butter.  Dunked half of each baked slice in bittersweet melted chocolate. Delicious!  Made one batch and my husband has almost finished the plate!

Everybody who’s tried these love them.  Frequently requested.  I find a proper serrated bread knife cuts them perfectly.  Also haven’t had a problem with cracking.  And, I find the the ingredient proportions to be perfect.

Perfect...you can add dry raisins or almonds too, it will turn out good. Next time I want to try to add some cacao to it! And very important to put them in a cookie jar or Tupperware so they stay soft.

I did not have almond extract so I added 1/4 cup anise.  Nor did I have enough pistachios so I substituted with almonds.

Amazingly great biscotti!  Absolutely will make again.

Good flavor, but wish I would have used a lighter olive oil or possibly vegetable oil. Regular EVOO gives too much of an olive oil flavor.

We stared making biscottis for Christmas gifts years ago making variations with toppings to the same recipe, but after I made this recipe once, it became my new favorite biscotti recipe. I made it with canola oil (I find the olive oil taste too strong on sweet cookie) dates, almonds and orange zest and everyone loved the softer texture since it calls for refrigerating the dough instead of adding extra flour. I oiled my hands when it got too sticky. My Sunday school group is getting together Saturday to make this recipe together after I shared them. This is a keeper!

This is are go to base recipe for biscotti, I recommend trying different fruits, nuts and seeds. Of coarse more is better! I would also recommend the broiler to toast them after baking.

Best recipe ever!! I’ve been making biscotti from other recipes for years for my husband and they just aren’t the same as the ones from a coffee shop or bakery. These were super close. The texture was the most similar of all the recipes I used. I will be using this recipe from now on.

I made this on Christmas Eve so my hubby and I would have with our coffee on Christmas Day.  These were so good and really simple to make too.  I will be adding these to my holiday cookie list.

I used part olive oil part vegetable oil, left out the cranberries and nuts but added in 1 tbsp orange zest. Dipped the tips in white chocolate when done.

The biscotti are delicious, and this recipe was very easy to make.  The dough is incredibly sticky, so wetting your hands with water prior to forming the two logs is essential.  I loved the pistschio and cranberry combo, but next time I may try almonds and dried cherries!

These made me the hero of the Christmas party! I made four different kinds of biscotti (these, chocolate, pumpkin and lemon-ginger) and these definitely won the prize. Teenaged boys preferred THESE to the chocolate ones! 
The key to the right level of crispness, I think, is the olive oil. (I used a very lightly flavored olive oil, so you don't really taste it.) The recipes with butter came out too soft . I read that "real" biscotti contains no oil or butter, but the no-oil-or-butter recipe came out too hard-- impossible to eat without dunking. I used a slightly heavy hand with the flour because it was a little loose. And I lightly roasted the pistachios and then hammered them a bit. This  will absolutely be my go-to recipe in the future. Thanks!

This is confection that I have been baking for several years and has always brought rave comments from the most critical.
My deviations from the original recipe are use of vegetable oil and one cup each of pistasio nuts and dried cranberries.
Also I have found using a silicon spatula to spread and shape the logs is easier and clean

These were a big hit over the holidays! I subbed white chocolate chips for the pistachios and melted more of them to drizzle over the top. Very pretty and delicious!

Delicious - they disappear fast!  If you are using a stand mixer ("A KitchenAid"), use the dough hook attachment for stirring in the cranberries and nuts.

This was a fun combination of pistachios and cranberry. I am so used to baking with butter so I didn’t love the flavor that the olive oil gave it. Good but not my favorite biscotti recipe.

Beautiful, easy, tasty..I let them cool after the first bake and did not have any trouble cutting them perfectly.  Next time I will add orange peel.  This time I followed the recipe exactly!  Highly recommend!

This is a very good biscotti recipe with a few tweaks. I didn't use the olive oil, rather canola oil so I wouldn't have to worry about the overpowering flavor. I also increased the oven temp to 350 for the first bake (and decreased the time by ~5 min) and then lowered it to 275 for the final bake. When I made these at 300 degrees for 35 min the first time, it wasn't cooked enough and didn't turn out the best.

12/20/17:  Yummy!  Mix the craisins and the nuts in with a spoon next time.  DEFINITELY wet your hands so the dough doesn't stick when forming the logs.  I did one big log and got 13 pieces.  Go smaller next time.  Also, do 1 cup craisins and 1 cup nuts and try adding some orange zest.

Made per recipe but 1.5 times the cranberries, used slivered almonds instead of pistachios just cause I had them on hand.  Also added 2 tsp of orange zest.  These were sooooo tasty.  They do spread some during baking, leave room, and don't make the loaves too large to start.  I started with mine 2 inches across and they expanded to around 3-4 inches. Really easy to make but took a little longer to dry out than recipe showed.   I put them on a cake rack on the cookie sheet when I put them back in oven to crisp up and then had to cook them for 30 minutes to get dried out completely maybe in part due to more cranberries.  Melted Semi sweet chips on a paper plate in microwave and dipped bottom of half of the biscottis in it, then dried on wax paper.  Put in gift bags for a Christmas party favor.  Lots of good feedback everyone loved them.   Wonderful flavor.

I followed the recipe to a T. Flavor was there but they weren't crunchy enough. I felt like the needed longer but since I've never made biscotti before I didn't trust my instinct. Wish I would have. My favorite part of these cookies is the super dry crunch.

The biscotti turned out wonderful.  The recipe is a definite keeper.  I only made one small change and that was to use avocado oil instead of olive oil.  Will make for Christmas this year.

Definitely five stars. I follow directions to the T. However I did flip them over once after eight minutes and bake them another eight minutes. Only because I like them toasty.

This recipe is so easy and so delicious. I will definitely be making it again. The only change I made was to drizzle chocolate on them. Isn't everything better with chocolate?

I followed the recipe as written, subbing sliced almonds for the pistachios. I had no trouble with the dough spreading or with the crumbling that some of the other reviewers mentioned.  I added 10 minutes to the second baking time, because I wanted to be sure they were crunchy. They are delicious!  I will be making these again , maybe trying some different add ins.

Followed the recipe and they taste great! Will make again and again - so simple; may try with slivered almonds next but they won't look as pretty as the pistachios green color to the red cranberries.

great recipe.  Although 1 1/2 of pistachios is a bit pricey so i used 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, half cup almond slices (to go with the almond extract) and half cup pistachios in each of my batches..

awesome and easy!

Excellent recipe which I would gladly make again but there are TWO things to look out for:
1. I live in Denver, and maybe it's the altitude, but I don't think so.  The temperature at which these should be cooked needs to be higher.  Mine did not cook at 300 degrees for the first part, I had to raise to 325 and there's no way the second baking would ever have happened in 10 minutes at 275 degrees.  Needs more heat.  Be careful.
2. Use a super sharp knife or chop the pistachios coarsely before you add them to the dough!  I slaughtered the first few of these with my trusty serrated bread knife (which works fine on other biscotti I have made).  I had to go to my very sharpest knife to cut through the nuts without harming the biscotti.

I made these following the recipe and instructions, and found the results to be irresistible. I don't think I changed anything, but found it somewhat difficult to work with the sticky dough. The next time I make them I will probably try almonds rather than pistachios mainly because I have plenty of almonds and no pistachios. I will also add a tad more almond extract since the flavor barely came through the first time. I probably needed to do the second bake (after cutting) a bit longer since they came out a little soft. But the flavor and appearance came out great and they can make a wonderful gift.

Good tip posted by another reviewer who says to spray your hands with cooking spray cause this dough is very sticky.  I substituted butter flavored shortening for half of the olive oil and liked the results much more compared to using all olive oil.  I've made these before and have given them as teacher's gifts.

I found an unopened bag of shelled pistachios (salted) and decided to make something with it.  This came out great! Served it to company to raves.  I didn't have an orange, so I used lemon zest.  I'm glad that other reviewers told me how wet the dough would be. I was a little apprehensive, but it came out  great.

I Love these. I replaced the cranberries with dried apricots and these are to die for. I don't even drink coffee. I like them because they aren't dry and chalky like most biscotti . I make them all the time

Great recipe.  I always double it because we enjoy longer, larger biscotti.  I follow the recipe as written and add some orange zest and play around with the nuts.   I always top them with drizzled semi-sweet chocolate.

4-1/2 stars. Very popular with my foodie kids (9, 11, 14). Love that it is dairy-free. They take turns making it themselves every Monday morning. We've made it as written; subbing pine nuts and eliminating fruit; and subbing almonds and dark chocolate DF mini chips. All very tasty! Definitely have wet hands when shaping loaves.

Yes, indeed, I would make this biscotti over and over.  However, I made a few changes the first time I made it.  For instance: 1.  I accidentally added 2Tbsp of vanilla extract instead of 1 Tsp, 2. Added a Tsp of almond, 3.  1Tsp of orange extract, 4. Added the zest of 4 oranges and 1 zest of lemon peel, 5.  1 C lightly grounded dehydrated cranberries, and 6. 1 C medium grounded pistachios.  Next, mixed all the items to complete recipe and shaped into a long log wrapped  in foil and placed in the refrigerator for 1.5 hours. Instead of baking the whole roll on the sheet,  I decided to slice the roll diagonally, and placed each slice on my cookie sheet using parchment paper.  I skipped baking the cookies in an entire roll for 30 minutes, then cooling, and baking more minutes.  That procedure seemed redundant and a waste of time.  The slices were baked at the suggested temperature of 300°F for a total of 30 minutes,. Finally, as soon as the rack came out, I transferred cookies to racks with a spatula, and covered with a towel to slowly cool.  I decided not to top with white chocolate because the orange zest and cranberries sweetened the cookies superbly.  Every time I have purchased biscotti, I take a couple bites and throw them out because they are hard as rocks.  My cookies did not resemble the usual shape of biscotti, but were more of an oval shape with 3/4 inch thickness by 3 inches length.  My friends loved the shape, texture, color, taste, and chewey eating.  I don't know

Excellent. I made it them exactly as the recipe called for. I let them cool for ten minutes before cutting and that worked perfectly. I will definitely make them again.

Made this recipe exactly as indeicated, used the olive oil I had on hand and it came out perfect, didn't have pistachios or cranberries instead I used chopped pecans and melted milk chocolate chips overtop. Make sure your hands are cool and wet when handling dough, I also should've left it in a little longer, the outsides were crunchy upon cooling but the inside was a soft cookie texture. Slice the loaves while warm, no sawing back and forth but one smooth motion downwards. Two loaves disappeared within hours, will be making another batch today. So quick and easy to make this recipes will become a staple.

These were pleasantly quick and easy to make. I used 1c of pistachios, chopped to reduce crumbling, 1/2c white chips, and 1/2c craisins. The directions for making the loaves weren't as specific as I'd like for size, but winging it turned out just fine. I had to cook them longer at each stage, but use your best judgment.
 They have a good flavor and I'll be making these again.

My first time making biscotti and I found it quite labour intensive. I didn't even want to taste them when they dried out so I left them in a tin for a couple of days.  Then I had some with coffee and they were great. Right now I am making a batch of gingerbread biscotti and then going to make another batch of these as gifts for friends. I am glad I got over my 'biscotti' fear because once you have made one batch the second one is much easier.  Definitely a keeper for me.

Love it! I did everything almost exactly as directed except I did not shape the loaves by hand; I put them into two standard loaf pans and shaped them a little on the tops. I also  baked them a little longer (the second bake), just to get the biscotti harder/crispier.

Very easy to make. The trick is having all the ingredients on hand. Pistachios and dried cranberries aren't staples in my house. Other than that, very easy and very delicious.

The best cookie that I have ever made! I get requests for this on every holiday and even just a coffee date with friends. It's always a hit! I follow the recipe as written and they turn out great every time! I do recommend wetting your hands when forming the logs, and I always cut with a chefs knife rather than sawing with a bread knife. Sawing has always broke the cookies for me. Definitely try this recipe!

An very good recipe. Mine are usually much harder and soak up coffee more...also, next time I wont add salt  and put more cranberries and less pistachios. Definitely a keeper.

First time making biscotti, and it came out great.  I used dried tart cherries with the pistachios, and actually added a little extra of both.  A little almond extract went well with that combination. It got rave reviews from everyone who tried it.  I tried dipping the ends of the finished cookies into melted white chocolate, but found that the coating outshone the great flavor of the cookie itself.  They are perfect as is!

I've been making this biscotti for a couple years now and my extended family are crazy about them. They aren't the type of cookie I'd normally like (chewy and chocolatey!) so I was surprised that I found them to be incredibly delicious and addictive. I love the combination of the vanilla and almond flavorings. They are festive at Christmastime with the green and red, but I make them throughout the year because they are just so good!

Great recipe! The second time around I added grated orange zest,  a few more cranberries, a few less nuts. I have tried this using butter instead as well and they turned out great. I found the olive oil taste was a little overwhelming.

I loved the biscotti! Would bake at a slightly lower temperature for the first baking.  The cherries are so chewy and wonderful to bite into an almond as well.

This was a fun and simple treat to make. We didn't have any almond extract or dried fruit on hand, so we used trail mix! We mixed it into the dough and moved the dough to the rack. It was easy to slice the dough after the first baking step.

I have made this recipe so many times  that I have lost count.  I use either canola oil or light olive oil (whatever I have on hand) and I do not recollect any difference in taste. I have also used different quantities and types of nuts and dried fruits,  which I chop into tiny pieces (making the baked log easier to slice for the second baking). I use a long serrated bread knife to slice the Biscotti and it works perfectly for me. I also continue to use my stand mixer when mixing in the nuts and fruit. The batter is very heavy and sticky. I follow the recipe and make each log 12" by 2" and flatten the tops and square off the ends.  Wetting your hands while forming the logs is a must.  
I made a batch yesterday using dried cherries and walnuts and they were devoured by my guests immediately. Today I made a double batch and froze them.  Absolutely everyone remarks that these are "the best Biscotti I have ever tasted" particularly because they are so tender.

Great easy recipe to follow... 
Reading everyone else's review, I put only quarter of a cup of green pistachios, quarter of cranberries, one slice of candied orange cut in bits.
I didn't want the biscotti to crumble due to too much fruit. 

Will try with original quantities next time. 
Dough was super sticky..l Put the dough in the refrigerator for 10 minutes and then used a little dry apf on the work surface to help shape the logs

I made these as written, except for altering the final cooking stage. They were easy and tasted spectacular. I'm not sure why people are saying they are hard to cut without falling apart. They were still warm when I cut them, and I had no trouble at all with a bread knife. It was also simple to slice through the whole pistachios, which I think are important for the look of the biscotti. I did take someone's suggestion to place them standing up during the last stage of cooking to dry them further, and I extended the drying time to 20 or 30 minutes--until they seemed dry to me.  I'm making them again today.

Just made for the first time today.  Really easy and really good! FYI.....Fresh Market sells a cranberry/pistachio blend  in bulk. I purchased 2 cups and saved myself a lot of time.

I have a problem with most biscotti recipes. I don't like them very crisp like you get in coffee shops and the way to get chewy is to use olive oil. The problem is I hate the taste of olive oil! My solution is to use a butter flavoured olive oil and it gives me oil texture with butter taste. I also lowered the almond extract to 1/8 tsp cause I find it too strong and I add 2 tbsp of brewed coffee after its all mixed up. To get nice big cookies just make one log and shape it to the size you want. Cooking times work perfect. If you want crispy biscotti, find a recipe that uses butter not oil.

Didn't use exact measurements for the pistachios or cranberries, about two handfuls of shelled pistachios and one of cranberries. I used pre-salted pistachios as well, since that was all I could find at the store, so I reduced the amount of salt that I added to the dough. They turned out fabulously! Big hit at the cabin, will definitely make this again!

I have made it several times. I need to bake it a little longer than 35 minutes to get the logs to come out light brown and the biscotti to ultimately come out a little crunchy the way I like it. Other than that I follow the recipe exactly.

We did it with the following changes:
- we didn't have a vanilla extract and used Europe style "vanilla sugar" (5 small bags = 50g) so we added 2 spoons of extra sugar (brown sugar) instead of 3/4 cups as per recipe
- we didn't have almond extract so we used about 2 spoons of ground walnut
- we add about one teaspoon of cinnamon (we were afraid that we don't have enough vanilla extract)

It was 5 star. You don't have to put it for the 2nd time in the oven btw, maybe it is even better that way (not sure)

I added 1 tsp orange extract, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, used only 1 cup of pistachios, and 1/2 cup sugar, based on other reviewer's comments.   I've made it this way MANY times...my daughter and I really enjoy it.  
When I bring some to work for a snack, as soon as I open the container, I smile--simply from the wonderful aroma.  EnJoy!

I made recipe exactly as written.  Next time, I will cut back or omit almond extract as I felt this was all I could taste.  I think some orange zest would cut the sweetness a bit, as well.

I did not change a thing!. Loved them. When I ran out of pistachio nuts (which cost a fortune) I substituted sliced almonds. Great base recipe. Use your imagination as far a nuts, dried berries and shredded coconut. Definitely a keeper!
PS, I see others saying that the olive oil flavor seeps through. I could not taste it at all. The recipe calls for light olive oil. I've used light and regular but definitely not EVO. Been substituting olive oil in every recipe that calls for canola or vegetable oil. Trust me, you cannot tell the difference

Great cookies. But I guess I should call mine Cranberry Orange Almond Biscotti. The only changes I made were, I increased the heat to 350oF and reduced the first cooking time to 22 min. I also reduced the almonds to 1/2 C. Then I drizzled with chocolate after the second baking. Yummy! I didn't cut them as in the video. I did width-wise, which is the more common way.

Will definitely make this again.  I didn't have almond essence so substituted 1/4 cup of the flour with almond meal.  Also added ground cloves for extra flavour as I didn't have any orange or lemon zest. Loved it.

It's turned out great. The almond extract is critical, it gives a good taste and smell. Instead of baking it for 35 min, make it like 10 more minutes because my came out a little soggy.

This was my first time making this, the dough was very wet & I was worried I had done something wrong - I used my kitchen aide mixer.  I followed the help with the "wet hands" & it went ok. They came out GREAT though! This was my 1st time making them. They are delicious!

It's a good solid recipe and I've made it a few times and tried some variations from the basic recipe, but it needs a few tweaks to make it really good. I prefer a more neutral tasting oil. I also often swap for almond or pumpkin seeds for something different.

I made these for the holidays and everyone loved them!! They were perfect! This was my first time making biscotti, so I read the reviews and followed some of Toni Lee's suggestions: baked at 325, added extra flour and cut them while they were warm which saved them from cracking.  I used almond extract and equal portions of pistachios and cranberries. When they were cool I dipped them half in chocolate. "Delizioso"!!!!

I replaced the pistachios for almonds in this recipe and cut the amount of cranberries and nuts down. It's hard to believe that something this simple could come out so beautiful. This recipe will be one that stays in my pocket for the holidays.

Easy to make and so delicious.  Drizzle with melted white chocolate for a little extra.  Perfect hostess gift at the holidays.  Make sure you have cold, wet hands when forming the logs to make it easier.  I usually make a double recipe as 4 logs cook nicely side by side in the oven (and trust me they go fast!)

Cooked meals from here many times, my first review. Made as directed, added a 1/2 c more cranberries as suggested. Really easy to make, super sticky dough but wet hands and quick placement to spray oiled parchment paper was the key. My kids are already asking when they can eat it!! Delish!!

These were great! I let the logs cool overnight before cutting. I used a smooth sharp knife as other reviewers have suggested. I coated the ends with white chocolate and sprinkled them with colored sugar. Thanks for the great recipe!

Pretty good and pretty easy, partly because you don't have to bring butter to room temp, so you can make this without planning ahead! I added zest & juice of 1/2 clementine because I had one handy. I also chopped craisins and pistachios.

Made a double batch last night. I substituted orange extract for the vanilla, and added some orange zest. The orange flavor really comes through without overwhelming the cranberries or  nuts. I expected this to be very crisp and dry, but mine turned out softer.  A bit drier than a cake or muffin, but not as dry and crisp as a cookie. I just love this "tough muffin" texture, and am actually very happy that mine did not turn out as crispy as I had envisioned.

It took at least 2+ cups of flour to make this a dough instead of a batter, and it took at least 45 minutes to bake the first time and at least 10+ minutes to dry the cookies at 275.

I used sunflower oil, but everything else the same. Perfect results twice.  I also didnt measure the nuts and berries, just made it to my liking.

I used pecans instead of the pistachios because that's what I had on hand.  I used extra cranberries.  These were awesome and travelled well.  I will definitely be making them again!

Super easy to make and incredibly delicious.  Made a batch and it didn't last very long.  I used a little more cranberries and it turned out very good.  
Neighbors came and loved it - all is gone.  Will be making more tomorrow.

Used half olive oil and half vegetable oil; golden raisins and walnuts. Dried them on a rack for the last 10 minutes in the 275 degree oven.

I prefer to make this with all butter... in stead of the extract I used orange zest and nutmeg.. about a teaspoon..   It makes an outstanding flavor.

I made this and had never tried Biscotti before. I loved the flavour and apparently it tasted like the real thing as the kids (Who love Biscotti) said it was REALLY good. :) Pleased that I made this one. :)

These were a hit. Easy to whip up. There are only  two things that need mentioning. First, increase the amount of flour to 2 - 2 1/2  cups. Second, bake these at 300.

Made changes as suggested by others. Also doubled amount of almond extract because I read recipe wrong but love it. Cut down pistachios to one cup. Chopped both the nuts and the cranberries. At the end baked 8 minutes then flipped and baked until done. Actually had to do this a few times to get desired doneness. Next time I'll know more what I'm looking for in the amount of brown I want for it to be dry. I dipped in melted semisweet chocolate chips that I melted with 1/2 Tsp of shortening. So pretty and yummy too.

I will never eat store bought biscotti again! This is the 2nd time I've made biscotti and the good reviews of this recipe is why I chose it.  The only change I made was 3 T less of sugar (I'm a diabetic) and I used Extra Light  olive oil.  I'm proud to send this to my good friend as a Christmas present.  The reviews are correct because it couldn't have been any better!!!

This recipe is great i made it as written no changes i feel you should that you should all ways  make a recipe as written to be able to make a fair judgement and give an honest review. I did not taste the olive oil at all that was a concern for me and i was a little afraid to make it but it was a delight with my coffee this is a keeper.

This is the best biscotti that I have ever made.  The final product looks almost store bought without any fuss.  I loved all the nuts and fruit and so did my family.  This  recipe is very easy and fast, and if you change up the extract, nuts and fruit the flavors are endless.  I did find the dough to be quite sticky however with a little flour the end results are great.  After I made this the first time, I still had time to make another batch; and I substituted lemon extract, toasted hazelnuts and chocolate chips for the almond extract, pistachio nuts and dried fruit.   I will definitely be making these again especially for gifts during the holidays.

Thanks so much for the Fantastic recipe. I was nervous about my olive oil not being light enough,  so I used the suggestion of safflower oil. Perfect!!!?? A new favourite, thanks again

I made this recipe many times. I used safflower oil instead of olive oil.  Olive oil has too strong flavor.  I also used whatever nuts I happened to have along with any dried dried fruit. Cranberries, prunes. Apple etc.  I made triple batches every 2 or 3 weeks for years because everyone loved this biscotti.

Loved them! Chopped up the cranberries and pistachios and also used canola oil as someone suggested.  I put in freezer for about 45 minutes and thoroughly wet my hands when handling the dough.  They were outstanding, easy and light! They are a keeper in my Christmas cookie rotation!

Really liked this recipe ~ I was afraid there would be too many nuts ~ is that possible??? ~ but it was great.  I used a combo of pistachios and pecans and added the dried orange peel (just a touch) ~ wonderful.  Thank you for sharing this recipe and thank you to those who made suggestions :)

If I had known how easy and delicious these are, I would have made more, and sooner! The only thing I changed was to use 1 cup each cranberries and pistachios, and I coarsely chopped the nuts.  They were easy to slice just as the original recipe stated, and my serrated Cutco (bread) knife worked perfectly. For the 2nd baking, I left the slices upright. Will be making more tomorrow!

The first time I used this recipe, the biscotti came out perfectly.  This time, I added 1/2tsp orange extract like how others said, but my dough came out quite sticky, unlike how it was the last time.  Even after adding 1/4C extra flour, it was still really sticky.

Awesome. Super easy. Didn't use nuts. They were easy to cut, and loved baking them myself. I saved this recipe.

I have made these for cookie exchanges in the past and had requests to make the again this year!  My only complaint is that when making several dozen, they can get pricey because of the pistachios...but so worth it!  I'll be giving these to my kids' teachers this year for Christmas :)

Splashed in a bit of orange liqueur in lieu of the almond and vanilla extracts. I also used whole wheat flour, which added an extra bit of complexity to the flavor, and kept the liqueur from making it too moist. It was fantastic.

This was simply the best! Everyone loved this biscotti. Even my mom, who makes amazing biscotti regularly, asked me for this recipe :) [the only modification: added 1/2 cup more flour to this recipe of 6 dozen servings (or 1/4 cup to the original 3 dozen servings...I made a ton because it was so popular!)]

I really love this cookie, not so sweet - perfect with coffee or tea. Even after the second-baking it doesn't get hard - there's enough soft crispiness in it.  I've put dates (because I just love them) and chopped walnuts, one time with slivered almonds, both work perfectly fine. Even the kids like them, they don't last long in the jar :)

Great Christmas cookie I've made two years in a row. These are easy, pretty and delicious (especially dunking in tea). The only change I've made is to add less nuts (1 cup is enough) but otherwise the recipe is perfect! Ideal for a cookie exchange and are way better than any store bought biscotti.

This recipe was fast, easy and so delicious! I did take previous advise and chopped the nuts quite a bit and gave the craisins  a ruff chop. I also sliced the biscotti as soon as it came out of the oven, and baked both sides for about 8 minutes. I like really crispy, crumbly biscotti. Will make again for sure!

Great biscotti recipe! I did have to bake it a little longer on the second round to get the crunchiness I was after, but otherwise followed the recipe pretty closely. I half-dipped them in white chocolate and dusted with red sugar to make it giftable. Love it!

Great recipe.  My only problem with it was that they came out way too sweet. The amount of cranberries (and I put less per other reviews)with the sugar was just too much.  I made a second batch with about 1/3 less sugar and they were perfect. I also chopped the cranberries and pistachios for the 2nd batch and it worked great (1st batch whole cran and pist would fall out or be harder to cut).

For the first time in all of my seventy-four years I made these biscotti yesterday afternoon.  Followed recipe EXACTLY and they are terrific!!!  I followed others' suggestions to cut straight through and had no problem with crumbling.  I'm sure I'll make another batch or two before the holidays.  Thank you for this one!

Excellent recipe! Make sure to keep wetting your hands with cold water when rolling out the logs, it does wonders. You don't need to use that many pistachios. Try to buy pistachios that have already been cracked, cracking them takes forever! Try to not buy salted pistachios ... if you do, then maybe omit the salt from the recipe.

Batter looks like it won't form a log, but by gosh if you keep your hands moist with cool water, it DOES!! Taste is outstanding and substitutions of fruit and nuts work great too.

It's delicious but took A LOT longer to bake than listed. Maybe it was just my oven, but it was really difficult to slice them as well. They still look good, just not EXACTLY what I was looking for.

YUM~!! i used craisins soaked in orange liqueur + pecans + orange zest and later drizzled with milk chocolate once cooled. i made a batch of these for the holidays and they shipped very well and got GREAT reviews. the recipe created very 'tender' biscotti- a million times better than those sold elsewhere.

this was so good.  i soaked the dried cranberries in the 1/4 c olive oil to plump them up a bit, then used the flavored olive oil in the recipe.  i also used all vanilla extract instead of almond.  i also dipped in white chocolate.  thanks so much for the recipe.  i'd love to try variations.

I made these for a cookie exchange last year and they were a big hit! This year I'm making them for another cookie exchange except I've decided to use dried cherries in place of cranberries and I added white chocolate chips. Very pretty and festive looking cookies! And they're delicious!!

I never imagined that biscotti would be easy to make. But, this recipe is very simple and fool-proof. I used whole wheat pastry flour, and chopped the pistachios. I also had some orange oil on hand, so I added a dash. They turned out delicious!

I love this recipe.  I have made it multiple times and it always turns out.  I took the suggestion of others and use 1/2 slivered almonds  and 1/2 pistachios, and 1 T. orange zest.  I also cover the loafs with a towel for the 10 mins it sits before cutting. Yum!!!!

Holy biscotti, batman! Although the sticky log-shaping process gives you serious pause, have faith! These biscotti turn out amazing. Use any kind of dried fruit you want (but cranberry really is good) and vary the nuts (slivered almonds work great, too). These disappear faster than you can make them. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

First biscotti attempt and every slice was lovely. This recipe has a nice light flavor and isn't sugary. I didn't have any almond extract so I subbed Amerreto and added teaspoon of Cointreau (what a lush!).

This biscotti is so addicting. Simple to make, but it takes a long time. It took me much, much longer for them to dry out for me than the recipe said, and I've made them several times.

Great recipe.  This was my first time making biscotti (I don't drink coffee, so I  hadn't ever really wanted biscotti).  But after my friend made these for a treat, I was hooked!  I gave some to my boyfriend to bring to work, and his boss called them "evil delicious biscotti of temptation". 

I followed all the suggestions made here: 1 cup cranberries + 1 cup pistachios.  I tried to de-skin all the pistachios, but, now that I think about it, you really don't have to.  Wet my hands before making the logs.  I made my logs rather narrow and long, so they cracked when I moved them onto the cooling rack, so next time I'll make them wider.  I'm really looking forward to making this again, but maybe change up the ingredients!

First time making biscotti & this recipe could not have been easier or tastier.  Very sticky dough, but, just keep finger wet as suggusted by recipe & it worked.  I used walnuts, golden raisins & cranberries...because that is what I had on hand.  Easily can add your own flavorings to make a sucessful biscotti.

MMM!  So good!  I just made these and like some others, I thought that after baking the second round, they weren't "dry" enough.  I put them back in another few minutes, but thought that maybe once they cooled, they'd harden up.  And they did! 

I used 1/2 cup of cranberries and 1 cup of pistashios.  I think 1.5 cups woul dhave been a little too much for me.

I plan on dipping one half of the biscotti in white chocolate.  This will make a great gift!

Everyone loves them, even people we aren't biscotti lovers.  The only thing I did differnt was used slivered almonds.  And I had a hard time with the second baking time, they were still soft after the 10 minutes baking so i baked them longer.  Then I put them on a wire rack and they hardened great.

Excellent! I didn't have (or even really care for) cranberries so I used mini-chocolate chips. I also substituted pecans for the pistacios. The biscotti turned out wonderful. I love the chocolate and pecan flavor with the base dough recipe. I am saving this one to my recipe box!

Turn out great. Dough is very sticky but wetting hands helps out a lot. Great taste and very fancy looking. Didn't have almond extract so used orange extract and were very tasty!

It tastes good, and I'd make it again, but in my opinion it's more of a cookie than a biscotti.  The dough is VERY sticky and spread a bit too much so that when we cut them they were flatter and not really 'biscotti' shaped.  But yummy.

This was my first time making biscotti. I actually made this recipe twice in a week to use up all the pistachios. My only small complaint is i couldnt get 18 slices out of the log. I actually used a ruler to measure the logs but just felt they were to thin cutting them into 18, so did about 12 slices per log. I did have to bake them longer also. They were wonderful though and will definatley make again.

These are PERFECT biscotti.  The other recipe I've used is (I guess) a classic Italian biscotti and uses no butter/oil, so it's pretty hard.  Perfect for dipping but very difficult to eat otherwise.  These, however, are perfect with or without coffee/tea.  I also love the fact that the oil used is olive oil...it keeps the ingredients true to origin of the cookie!

Easy to make but hard to cut with whole pistachios, will chop them next time.  Had to cook longer to get them crunchy and hard. Not too sweet but added chocolate drizzle to sweeten then up.

Can't believe how well these turned out!  Follow the directions and you too will be a biscotti maker. Have tried some substitutions for the cranberries and pistachios:  dates and pecans, also candied cherries and almonds.  Bad substitution: fruitcake mix-- looks festive but still takes like fruitcake.

I just finished making these for my yearly christmas boxes (I usually pick 7 cookies) and I thought that they are not only very good but fairly easy to make.  I doubled the recipe and I did 2 cups dried cranberries, 1 cup pistacho nuts and I added 1 cup for white chocolate chips.  Will make these again.  My 5 year old son is eating them up.

Holy Moly!!!!!!!!  This is the most easy recipe in the word.  The only downside is I ate the whole batch myself and now I need to make more....  I was a bit nervous about the texture before baking but sooooo pleasantly surprised at the end result.

I'm not a big fan of biscotti but these were really good and festive too.  These are extremely sticky so much so that I thought I messed something up.  To my surprise they set up nicely.  I dipped these in white chocolate for a little extra something.

They rock, what more can I say =) I used half normal olive oil half canola, because I dont buy light olive oil. Also, 1 cup nuts 1 cup cranberries. I kept them a bit longer in the oven to dry out, just with the heat off and the door slightly open. Delicious! I might try the version with orange extract too.

Very tasty and quite pretty for the holidays!  VERY sticky dough, wet my hands as recommended.  I was worried that I was getting the dough too wet, but recipe is very forgiving and they came out good.  I would definitely cut the pistachios back to a cup, as I felt it overpowered the cranberry flavor.  It also took me a lot longer to work with the dough and get the right size log, but the dough did not get "overworked".  I also like the idea of varying the type of nuts and additional add-ins!!

Really easy and fun to make.  They tasted great!  I made the first batch exactly as the recipe called for.  The second batch I changed the cranberries and almonds to chocolate and pecans.  These will make great gifts!

Being Italian my mom's been making Biscotti for years.  I had to force her to try this one because it was "different" and mom always sticks to what goes over with the family so she didn't want to change.  Once she and I made these together (that was the only way to get her to try them) she won't make anything else!!  They are wonderful!  Only difference is I cut back on the nuts and now they're perfect for me and mom!!

This was the first time I've made biscotti, I made it for my Mom for Christmas and she loved it, it's already gone.  I confess, though to a change or two.  I used vegetable oil, and almonds rather than pistachios.  As others have said, ~wet~ your hands if the dough is too sticky, and also it took mine a bit longer to dry, probably because I didn't have any parchment paper.  I will absolutely save this recipe and make again!  Thanks!

This is an awesome recipe. Although there are a few more steps vs. other cookies, they are definitely worth it. I make them every Christmas and always get compliments.

This was a tasty recipe and pretty easy too.  I substituted rough chopped almonds for the pistachios and they worked out great.

These weren't bad, but with all the stars I expected more.  At the end of the party I threw out half eaten ones.

This is a great recipe!  I used one cup dried cherries and one cup pistachios instead of cranberries and they were perfect.

This was one of the best recipes for a Christmas cookie.  I made this biscotti last year and ended up doubling the recipe twice by Christmas.  I will make this again and double the recipe from the start.  Great w/tea, coffee, family and friends.
