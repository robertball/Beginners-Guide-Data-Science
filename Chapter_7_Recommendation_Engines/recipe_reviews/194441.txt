Solid recipe to build upon.  I felt the flavor was good but I prefer a few more seasonings.  I marinated the mushrooms in a balsamic vinagrette dressing which really pumped up the taste.  I added Montreal Seasoning to the avocado spread and also just a touch of red pepper.  Fabulous!

I'd never tried portabella mushrooms before, but I was pleasantly surprised. Make sure to sautee them enough, because too raw doesn't taste nearly as good. The avocado spread is so good (I added lemon juice per another review and light sour cream in place of yogurt). I don't like onion slices or peppers, so I added tomato and lettuce. Be warned, it's VERY messy, but definitely worth it.

I made this for me and my husband and we were both pleasantly surprised at how delicious this burger was!! This is now a main staple in our dinners.  All the flavors blend nicely together and the red peppers are a must as it gives a nice sweet taste. You must try this bella burger, it truly is delicious!!! HOwever, I make the guacamole sauce and spread it on and omit the slices of avocados.  The burger is too big with all that I add too it (lettuce, tomato, fresh mozzarella cheese).

Excellent!!! I loved this....the avacado spread was so tasty...I used fat free "Fage" greek plain yogurt. I also grilled some red peppers myself instead of the jarred roasted peppers. Such a tasty and healthy sandwich....hmmmm...maybe might add a slice of provolone next time. Will make again...thanks!

Wow!  I gave this recipe 5 stars because we're HUGE hamburger fans and would never in a million years have thought we'd eat a meatless burger, however this was EXCELLENT!!!  The portabellas are delicious!  Only things I did differently (after trying the original recipe first, of course) was that I used 1 tbsp. mayo & 1tbsp. yogurt, added a splash (really, just a small splash) of soy sauce in place of the salt for added flavor.  Also, I marinated the mushrooms in just a bit of dressing first.  And I have to tell you, I found myself surprised that I wasnt missing the meat with this one.  My picky never-eat-a-meatless burger husband totally changed his tune and asked for this twice in one week!  Thank you for the recipe! It will be a regular!  :-)

Portabella mushrooms are a great meat alternative. The avocado spread is delicious. This is a wonderful combination of flavours.

Tasty, light, and flavorful vegetarian fare that will delight herbivores and carnivores alike.  My partner and I had these tasty portabellos with the extremely flavorful avocado sauce-like spread.  My partner, who prepared the dish, cut a sixth of a lemon and squeezed the juice into the avocado sauce, and then mixed.  I am only mentioning these deviations to the recipe because what I experienced when I ate this sandwich was pure and utter bliss.  I strongly recommend those, tiring of barbecued chicken, burgers, steaks and fish to venture into this prime example of vegetarian cooking.  One other thing, those interested in cheese, should consider adding a slice of sharp provolone on top of the portabello in the last 3 minutes of barbecuing; although time does vary depending on your preference.  In sum this recipe will provide experience, you won't be disappointed.

As I made it:
Fried up two portobellos for eight minutes on medium with olive oil, salt, freshly ground black pepper
Toasted two onion rolls
Put portobellos on bottoms of rolls, cavity up, and topped with guacamole and the other half of the roll
Delicious!

Absolutely incredible!!  We made the sauce with a touch of cayenne because we love spicy food, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  They were delicious!  This recipe will definitely go into the file to be made again and again.  Thanks!

Just ate this for lunch!  I made several changes to the recipe.  I used two portabella mushrooms instead of four, but kept the quantities of the remaining ingredients the same.  The mushrooms and onions were cooked simultaneously. Didn't have yogurt, so I used miracle whip; omitted the red pepper; instead of minced garlic I used garlic powder; substituted hamburger buns with fiber one country white bread; and instead of using half the avocado for the mixture, I used the entire avocado and omitted the avocado slices.  It came out a bit sloppy with avocado mixture coming out of the sandwich, but it was delicious and very fast to make.

This avocado spread is so good!!!!  My avocado didn't mash up well, so it was a bit chunky, but I didn't use any sliced avocado on my sandwich so it worked out perfectly.  Thank you!

This was delicious! I had the whole family down and everyone enjoyed them. I had some already made portabella patties in the freezer that I used and  didn't have yogurt so I just used sour cream. I will definitely make these again.

We loved this. We didn't use avacado slices AND the guac, but the  guac was more than enough.  I added in a generous handful of cilantro to the guac because I have a ton on hand. We also used the multigrain sandwich thins, which are nice in burgers so they don't get too bready.

I was looking for something to use up the portabellas and avocado, and luckily stumbled upon this!  Quite delicious!  The mushrooms weren't as flavorful as I would have liked.  Perhaps a marinade next time would suffice?  I also wanted to make the meal stretch a bit further, and used the avocado spread as a salad dressing instead of putting it on the sandwich--delicious on lettuce!

This was surprisingly yummy!! =) The avocado-yogurt mix made it perfect! I also put a lot of  minced garlic (since we love garlic in the house) to one small package of yogurt and one whole avocado-so heaven! I love arugula and so I put some on mine and made a difference too! Hubbie was raving how delicious the spread was..Definitely making this one again! Thanks for sharing..

Absolutely delicious.  My wife said that something as good as this could make her a vegetarian.  Recently, I bought some Portabellas that were huge; too large for buns.  So, instead of grilling onion slices, I caramelized the onions and topped the avocado spread mushroom with them and the red peppers.  I honestly like it better without the bread.

I used nonfat greek yogurt and diced up some scallions since I was out of onions. This turned out fabulous, and they were so easy to make! Even the kids enjoyed it. I will definitely be making this again.

this was great! I put the mushrooms in the microwave wraped in a damp paper towel to save some time. I also used Hawian bread rolls which were awesome!

Very good!  I used a fresh red pepper and cooked it with the onions.  I also made the dip out of the whole avocado and used this on the top and bottom of the bun, we dipped our fries in what dip was leftover : ) Thanks for sharing.

I liked this burger. I didn't have any yogurt so I used sour cream. I also added lemon juice to the avocado sauce to give it more flavor. I added lettuce and tomatoes to make it more like a real burger. I enjoyed it and will definitely make it again.
