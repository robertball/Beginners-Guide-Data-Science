Mrs Jones must be a Rochester, NY native. All the right ingredients, I just like mine with a lot more chili powder and cayenne. Personal thing. I also add a 1/2 cup of beef broth in place of water initially.

I'm from Rochester, NY and this is very good hot sauce. I add about a 1/2 cup frank's Red Hot. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe turned out horrific. I was so looking forward to it but the vinegar was still present even after the full cooking time and then some. Also the cinnamon, allspice and clove mix was just too over powering. I wish I could have some how saved it by doctoring it up but the combination of spices were too strong.

My husband, a Rochester native, introduced me to the garbage plate sauce. I haven't had a garbage plate yet, but I love this sauce smothered on eggs and Zweigle white hots (another Rochester delicacy) or any hot dog. This recipe looks, smells, and tastes like the original from what I can tell.  I suppose I'd have to eat them side by side to know for sure.  It's so easy - barely any prep - and freezes well, too!  The only thing I did differently is used less water than called for in the recipe.  I didn't pour it all in at once, adding 1/2 cup at a time until I reached the consistency I like.  It's yummy!

I just got done making this.  I am a Rochester native but also a vegetarian so I've always gotten the grilled cheese garbage plate without the meat hot sauce.  I made this for me and my husband with veggie burgers and I used tofu crumbled up for the hot sauce.  They came out great!  My (non-vegetarian) husband said they tasted just like Nick Tahou's!  I didn't have the allspice or thyme but the hot sauce was delicious!! To make it with the tofu I squeezed out the excess water and baked the tofu at 375 for about 25 minutes to get rid of some of the water.  Then I simmered the tofu adding a little oil and all the ingredients and then added water until it was the right consistency.  You really can't taste the tofu (and what a healthy alternative!).  This sauce was really great and the garbage plates hit the spot!

This was pretty good.  All the spices were a bit different with the beef but still good.  I have never had a "garbage plate" so I had to google it to see what to make with it.  I chose to do home fries, cheeseburgers and macaroni salad.  Adding ketchup and mustard were the final touch.

This was so good!  Being from Rochester, I was skeptical, but I wanted to give it a try.  Yummy!  It tastes better at Vic & Irv's and NT only because I don't have to make it myself or do the dishes!

I am a Rochester born native that is living in Ohio. I met my boyfriend at a party at RIT and we have been dying for a garbage plate since we have moved to Ohio (he's originally from Cleveland). We've tried other imitations but this recipe is by far the best. Thank you so much!!

I saw this on a food channel, and it looked and sounded good. I have never been to Rochester so I have nothing to compare it to. The only ingrediant I did'nt have was allspice, everything I followed to the T. I think "IF" I ever make it again I will cut the clove to just a pinch, ( still tasting them today), maybe more chili and cayenne .

Not being from Rochester I found this sauce mediocre at best.  It has WAY too much black pepper but could use some more chili pepper.  I added 8 oz of canned tomato sauce to calm the black pepper.  I doubt that I'll make it again.

I ( being from Rochester N.Y ) had to try this, and it was great, Almost as good as the original Nick Tahou plate, although I had to add more Chili & Cayenne to get it spicy enough (as well as one of my own special additives of just a drop or two of Dave's Insanity Sauce for that super spicy kick)  Although the name of a dish called " A Garbage Plate " sounds terrible it is and has been a great tasting dish that is loved by most all of Rochester N.Y. residents so much it has touched off copy-cat dishes at quite a few area restaurants if ever in Rochester try the original, you won't be sorry ( As the saying goes among area college students say... "You haven't experienced Rochester until you have had a Garbage Plate" )

I made this Vegetarian, using Beefless Ground Beef. HOLY MOTHER IT WAS AMAZING. I spooned it over diced potatoes that I baked in the oven. I added extra Chili Powder, Cayenne, Cinnamon, and gave it a dash of Tobasco sauce. ALL TOGETHER IT WAS ONLY 402 CALORIES! Definitely making this a staple meal. Thank you SO much!

Very Good. I have been  to nic tahoe's only 1 time while visiting my brother,who has since moved back to this area. I found the recipe while looking for another hot dog sauce and thought I'd give this a try. Well to make a long story shorter ,he says it's very authentic You can really taste the clove and cinnamon. Now it's time to make a garbage plate

This was a good basic recipe. I'd make it again but I'd add more cayenne and a little less cloves.

I being from Rochester N.Y also had to give this a try.I also added more chili powder and more cayenne to spice it up. I also added some mustard and onion powder. I think this is a great base sauce to start with. I've tryed many recipes for this type of sauce and always seem to feel that some thing is missing. I feel that Vic and Irvs is the best and I can't find anything close to it.Thanks for posting this recipe.

There aren't many hots places around Rochester that I haven't tried.  This recipe yields an excellent hot sauce, better than the more commonly found recipes out there.   I added a touch of beef broth like someone here recommended, and at the end threw in a few dashes of red hot, but that's it.   A hand blender works well for fine grinding the whole thing once it's simmered.   Definitely developed more flavor after ~1 hr on low.      Thanks for a winner!

I have made this recipe multiple times minus the blending part (I just mash the beef up fine with a spatula while cooking). Each time this recipe turned out amazing! Last night I got a real garbage plate from Rochester and the sauce didn't even compare. My boyfriend agreed this recipe is much better than the real thing!!

Awesome!  Perfect on Zwiegle's White Hots (Another Rochester must have!) and burgers, potatoes and mac salad!!It looks gross when you dump it all over your plate (Thus the name Garbage Plate) but you will savor EVERY BITE, I assure you! It should be more watery than "Gravy like", so expect that.  I adjust the recipe for 24 or more servings and freeze it in small containers so we can take out how much we need and it's always available. Thank you Mrs.Jones!

Don't use the amount of ground cloves listed, it completely overpowers the rest of the spices and makes it inedible. 
I discarded mine and started over.
Adjusting the recipe for one pound of ground beef, I added just 1/8 tsp. of cloves and it was fine.

From Rochester and this is great! Doubled the recipe and left the burger grease in it (since it’s a garbage plate after all) and added about a teaspoon of red pepper flakes and about 3tbsp of hot sauce (tapatio is my favorite for some slow heat) and it still wasn’t too spicy. I ended up making plates for about 20 with the double recipe and I didn’t even get to eat one since they got gobbled up. I tasted the sauce though and it was fantastic!

Great sauce, The best to make a plate. Or to have on Hot Dogs.  Just be careful with the Cinnamon, it can be over powering.

Being from Rochester I have missed a good garbage plate. Whether it's Nicks, Marks or the other I have been craving them for years but never found anything even close. Lets just say this is as close as you will ever get and to me taste exactly like I remember.  Have it over burgers, hots or sausage patties. All fries or half fries and macaroni salad. Top with onions and mustard.Don't forget the tabasco and a couple slices of Italian bread. You can tell by the reviews the people who have never been to Rochacha and ate a garbage plate.  Also cures hangovers.

We moved across country 5 year ago.  I made this tonight and it was PERFECT!  Many of us were so surprised that it tasted just like what we get back in Rochester.  The only thing I didn't add was the vinegar, due to not having any.  Honestly it didn't even need it.  I will definitely make it again.

This is the best meat sauce recipe I have found!!! We get white hots and Texas red sent to Oregon to replica a garbage plate. My guy is from the Rochester area and he was in absolute heaven.

I've been searching for years for a good recipe for the GP sauce.  While this one tastes great, it's still not the same.  To this recipe I added 3 oz Tomato paste, 1/4 cup of brown mustard, 1 tsp Brown Sugar.  Oh, and I did not include the cloves powder.

12.24.13 - In an effort to replicate another Rochester joint's flavor (Charlie Riedel's), I followed my brother's advice and made the following changes:

Made it with vegetarian "beef" crumbles so that DBF could partake
Left out cloves and cinnamon
Added a tiny bit of olive oil with the "beef"
Did NOT stick the "beef" in a blender

Next time, I may cut back on the black pepper a little and leave out the cumin.

02.02.14 - Made this for party, doubled recipe (still vegetarian), kept other mods and halved black pepper and cumin.

05.02.14 - No cumin, cinnamon, or cloves.  Halve the black pepper.  Add a little bit of olive oil (for veggie ground).
