Made for Recipe Group. Hubby and I both liked this, we ate almost the whole bowl at dinner one night. You know when something is 'moreish' it's pretty darned good! I used a chili garlic sauce and rice vinegar. Lemon basil is a nice touch, little lighter than regular basil with that lemony undertone. Eating tomato and melon together was a little weird for me, but it works well together. It was definitely spicier the next day for the chili sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

We love this refreshing salad! I used Black Cherry Tomatoes and Basil from my garden. The flavors go together so well with the sweet of the honey and then the tang of the vinegar. Give this recipe another five stars because it is so beautiful. Thank you Doug Matthews

This was a very tasty and refreshing salad.  Would definitely make it again.  I used red wine vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar.  Wasn't able to find sriracha so improvised with minced garlic and chile powder.

Wow just love this recipe.  Like one other reviewer I used sweet chili sauce as that is all I had in the house.  So I cut the honey in half and did not add the salt.  After it sat in the fridge I had a couple ounces of feta cheese which added the salt.  Will be making again.  Thank you Doug for such a wonderful recipe.

Recipe Group Selection:  05, July 2014 ~ A unique combination of ingredients and taste.  I didn't have rice wine vinegar, so I used rice vinegar, and only had regular basil.  Even with those two subs, we enjoyed this salad.  It had heat the night I made it, but it had a lot more heat the following day from the Sriracha®. The color combinations from the watermelon and tomatoes made for a nice serving presentation.  Thanks, Doug for sharing.

This is the first review I've ever left, but just had to because the recipe is awesome! It has become a summer staple; super-simple to make and the flavors are fantastic. I've even made up the dressing by itself for other salads. It goes beautifully on Bibb and leaf lettuces. Well done, Doug! Thank you!

Easy and a refreshing change.  Used Thai-Style Chili Sauce, which had just the right kick and a great balance of flavors!
