Made this for Christmas morning and once since then with modifications that have turned out beautifully.  Texas Toast works wonderfully for this recipe - 6 slices (which look pretty halved on the diagonal) fit perfectly into the 9x13 pan.  I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and increased the cranberries to 3/4 cup.  As recommended by another reviewers, I let the dish sit overnight with some soda cans on top to help the bread soak up the egg.  I found that it helps to spray the aluminum foil cover with cooking spray before baking, else the bread puffs up and sticks to the  foil.  I also baked for much longer than  called for -- 1 hour  covered and ten minutes uncovered. We will make this again and again!

This was quick, easy and wonderful to wake up to on a Sunday morning! I scaled the recipe in half and cooked in a 8"  or 9" square pan.  I also covered with foil overnight and laid some soda cans on top so that the french bread would soak up all the milk mixture.  No need for syrup here!

This was pretty good.  I don't think that I would make it again because the presentation was not so good.  I flipped it over but it still looked ugly.  If you are trying to impress...try the Creme Brulee French Toast on this site.  That one is to die for!

I was surprised to see some 3 star ratings on this - I think it tastes great, and it smells wonderful, too.  I have made it for my parents and in-laws, and they've all loved it.  I used a loaf of bakery Italian bread, which I cubed to allow the bread to soak up the egg more easily and to make it easier to serve when finished. I let the cubed bread dry out a bit before mixing in the egg since that seems that very fresh bread gets doughy after it sits in the egg overnight.  Granny Smith apples work well for me.  For more tang, I suggest dried cherries instead of dried cranberries.

I make this french toast every Christmas morning and everyone loves it and now looks forward to it.  I always make it the night before.  This past Christmas I used orange flavored Craisins and everyone thought that it added a nice flavor.  Enjoy!

This recipe was satisfactory. Some of the bread was a little dry. If I make it again I will use more liqiud and omit the rasins.

This recipe didn't come out as I had hoped.  The apples were mush and the flavor cooked out.  I did use whole grain bread however, I will try again with French bread and cut the apples bigger next time.

GREAT brunch recipe.  Very easy and is made ahead of time. I've made it several times and everyone loves it and asks for the recipe.  The only thing I have done to change the recipe is leave out the raisins and/or currants.  They are not missed.

I halved this recipe and made it in an 8x8 dish, and it was fantastic.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and cubed the bread instead of slicing it, but otherwise, that's the only change I made.  My mom was leary of eating it b/c she thought it would taste like bread pudding (which she hates), but she loved it and even asked for the recipe.  I inverted the whole thing on a platter as suggested, and it was beautiful.  I will definitely keep making this.  I also liked that, unlike similar recipes, this one can be made with only four hours refrigeration instead of overnight.  This works well for me because sometimes we eat breakfast for dinner.

This recipe was wonderful.  It was easy to prepare and was a big hit at our holiday breakfast.  I would try one change that I used in a similar recipe.  I would not put cinnamon in the milk mixture.  After I've poured the milk mixture, I would dot with 2 T. butter, then mix 3 T. of sugar and 2 t. of cinnamon and sprinkle on top.  I think this will give it a little more flavor.  Either way would be great!

My gang loved this recipe! I skipped the raisins and the cranberries and just used whatever apples I had sitting around. I had concerns that the bottom would be so sticky that I wouldn't be able to get the french toast out, but surprisingly, after I loosened the edges it flipped over perfectly and looked very appealing. Once out of the casserole, I topped with some maple syrup and broiled for just a minute or two to carmalize the top. I then sprinkled with a bit of powdered sugar. How nice to wake up and just have to pop something in the oven!

This is a delicious recipe and especially good for Christmas morning.  The dish can be assembled the night before and baked while the family is busily opening their Christmas presents!  I have passed this recipe on to several friends who now include it with their favorites, too!

This recipe was very good.  It was best refrigerated overnight.  The only thing that I recommend is that you use a smaller (not as wide) bread, like french, because it is much easier to serve individual portions.  The inverted serving method was very pretty, by the way.

There is an apple pancake that we order at a pancake house that is delicious but something you have to eat right away.
This recipe tastes just like that apple pancake, and it is easier to make.  I made it on Christmas eve and baked in on Christmas
morning.  Since there were only two of us we ate it for several days and it reheats beautifully.  Next time I may cube the bread,
there was plenty of the egg-milk mixture for it to absorb.  It is not a hardship to have leftovers.

Outstanding recipe!  Tried this recipe this weekend to test, in hopes that it would be our Christmas morning breakfast.  Came out perfect the first time, following the recipe as written.  I am definitely serving this - it's a keeper!

I loved it.  I was looking for a vegetarian brunch recipe & this fit the bill.  It was nice to make it the night before & just pop it in the oven before my guests arrived.  I used a sugar free brown sugar substitute.  As my husband thought it was a little too sweet, I might experiment & make it using 3/4 cup brown sugar next time.  I used whole wheat bread to make it more nutritious & also cut the bread into about one inch cubes (keeping the crust on), instead of leaving the bread in slices.  My other tip is to make sure you have enough of the egg mixture to moisten the bread.  I thought it was too dry so I added more egg mixture.  Depending on how many slices of bread you use, my guess would be to use about one egg for about one and a half pieces of bread.

We made this Christmas morning, and it was sooo good. I cubed the bread instead of slicing it, and next time I will toast the cubes before adding to the recipe (it was a bit too soft in the middle for me).  Also, I used wheat Hawaiian rolls instead of french bread, and it was very good. Great recipe, and we will be making this again.

Imho, more a bread pudding than a French toast but a great brunch recipe anyway. We really enjoyed the warm mix of flavours!  Make sure to bake covered (as suggested by the recipe), otherwise the bread will be too dry on top.

My family liked this a lot. The middle of the bread remained soft, so don't expect a totally toasted through toast.

This is makes a beautiful presentation for a holiday breakfast.  It is rich and I wouldn't want as an "every day" French toast but to me and my family it is a perfect treat for special occasions.  The cranberries are great with it.  I didn't change anything with the recipe.

Very good. I made the recipe as stated except that I used enough thickly sliced french bread to cover the top. I would make this again & probably vary the fruit next time...strawberry sounds good...

I was not too crazy about this recipe. The bread was soggy and my husband and I did not like that part of it. The apples/raisins were great! Will probably not make it again
