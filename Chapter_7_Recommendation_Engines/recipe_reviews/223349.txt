While preparing a cure for homemade Canadian bacon I needed 6 T. of Montreal Steak Seasoning and only had one.  I made up a batch of this one and compared the flavor the the original.  While completely different...I think this one is more flavorful.  The only thing I didn't care for was it was a little too salty for me...but I don't use very much salt at all.  Most people would find this perfect.  At any rate...this recipe saved the day for me making my bacon.

I had to adapt this a bit because all I had was finely ground pepper. I used 1 tbsp pepper and it was a bit overwhelming so I added another tablespoon of a salt/red pepper flake mix. I left out the 1tbsp of red pepper flakes and the 1 tbsp paprika and used 1/4 tsp of a very hot cayenne. I also subbed the 1 tbsp dill seed with dill weed just under 1tbsp. I altered this a lot but it was still delicious. I used it on chicken and my house smelled like I was grilling steak! Also good on eggs

Used about  1 teaspoon salt instead of a tablespoon, also used dill weed instead of dill seed. Cooked steaks on grill. Awesome! Definite keeper for me.

I was making a pork chop recipe that called for Montreal Steak seasoning. Not having any, I found this seasoning substitute.  Very good combination of flavors .  I did not read closely enough that I needed dill seed instead of dill weed - so I had to substitute (added 1 teaspoon of dill weed instead of the 1 TBL of dill seed required).  Will try it again with the dill seed - I understand dill seed has a nuttier-type of flavor.  I also didn't have a mortar and pestle so I put the spices in a plastic zip lock sandwich bag and pounded lightly with a hammer.  Last,  I did not add the salt as the recipe I was making it for had plenty of salt in a gravy.  But it was really good on  those pork chops and made the kitchen smell great!
