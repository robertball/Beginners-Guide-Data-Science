Great Pie.  I love chess pies so I thought I would try this one.  I'm not a big fan of raisins so I just put in the nuts. I was worried it might not taste that great but it was wonderful.   Everyone loved it.  My mom even asked how to make it.  This is not as sweet as a chess pie and I like it that way.  My mom and I cut the sugar when making one anyway.

Very pleased.  I used Chopped Pecans in place of the Walnuts, and Splenda Baking Sugar in place of regular sugar, turned out great.

This pie is divine! If you like rich desserts, this is one to try. I omitted the walnuts as my boyfriend doesn't like them (I will make one with nuts for this Christmas though lol) and it was still great.

Easy to follow. Got rave reviews from my Finnish inlaws. I used only one cup of raisins and half cup of walnuts (all I had), and boiled water to just pour over the bowl of raisins, rather than actively boiling the raisins. Worked great. Served with vanilla sauce, but next time I might serve with vanilla ice cream or caramel sauce.

Delicious! I used more raisins, because there was only alittle bit left in the bag, and brown sugar instead of white (my preference). Will make again.

Magnifficent,spectacular,i have found nervana! This recipe is better than any pecan, or chess i have ever had. All other pies will never be the same. It is very addictive, and may be dangerous if there isn`t enough to go around.

Very very rich pie.  I liked it but was the only one for our Christmas dinner.

This is an excellent pie.  All our family thought it was the best ever and some preferred it to pecan because it was not quite so sweet.

Man, this pie is great!  It is so creamy.  It does not last long.  Deserves the extra effort of a home-made pie crust.

I gave this 4 Stars only because I rarely (if ever) rate any recipe a "5". That notwithstanding, this is a wonderful recipe. I made 2 of  this pie for the 1st time today -- one for my family to "test", the other to bring to tomorrow's Thanksgiving gathering. So far? RAVES! (For whatever reason, my pies don't look all that much like the pics. At the same time, with 6 RAVES already on the  scoreboard, I'm not going to ask any questions, lol).

This was okay. Not the best I have ever had. I did have to bake closer to an hour and made without raisins and walnuts. It had a great texture and set perfectly for me.

Just like I remember my Aunt Marie's Chess Pie except she topped it with meringue. One of my childhood favorites and now I can enjoy it as an adult!

Maybe it's just a matter of taste but I found this pie much too sweet. After the first couple of bites I just couldn't eat any more. I followed the directions exactly except for omitting the walnuts.

Delicious! Came out perfect. The only thing I did different was soak the raisins in water and rum. Yum! I also let it sit in the over until it cooled. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!
