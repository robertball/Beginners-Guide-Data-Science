Absolutely the best persimmon cookie I've ever had.  Moist and delicious.  I have two 5 year olds and a 6 year old who will usually eat only chocolate.  However, I can't make enough of these at a time to keep up with them.  They want them for breakfast even!  Just great!  Thanks!

This recipe has been in my family for over 70 years now.
I love it and make it every year when the persimmons are ripe.
We have our own tree just so I can make these cookie.  I freeze
in packets so I can have them all year long.  Everyone I serve
them to loves them.  So glad someone else had the same recipe and was willing to share it with others.

Made with persimmons from the back yard, these cookies are awesome!!  Taste kind of like a ginger snap, very yummy and soft.  Might be good iced as well.

I made the recipe exactly as stated, baking each tray of cookies for 10 minutes, and they came out perfectly.  I was surprised how soft they were, but they were done when I checked the centers.  I'd never had persimmons before, but someone gave my husband this fruit.  I found this recipe and the rest is history! :-)

Here in Japan, persimmons (kaki) are quite popular and there's quite a surplus. So I surprised my co-workers and friends with these and they were amazed. However, I used half brown sugar, added vanilla extract, extra cinnamon, no nuts, and in a few I experimented with making chocolate swirls. These cookies are a bit on the cakey side, but a nice way to utilize such a good fruit. Thanks!

This is a moist, flavorful cookie.  I absolutely love the spices!  They are cake-like and delicious!  I changed a few things such as: using butter instead of shortening.  (Coconut oil would be a great healthy substitute.)  I replaced the sugar with sucanat and the flour for whole wheat flour.  They turned out very well (see my picture) and they weren't flat.

I just can't decide whether I like persimmons. These were enjoyable, but I don't know that I'd make them again unless someone gave me some persimmons. Mine did not spread like in the photo, so they looked kind of clumpy.

I've never made or even had a persimmon cookie before, so I have nothing to compare the taste to, fyi. I omitted the nuts because I didn't have any on hand. I thought that this had more of a 'pumpkin' bread texture, as moist as it was. I liked them, but they were definitely a different kind of cookie.

We only recently tried Persimmons (raw) and liked them a lot. Then we found this recipe. I have two children, and all of us really like these cookies. My daughter described it as a soft gingerbread cookie with fruit inside. Very delicious.

Very good cookies, but I thought the cloves overpowered everything. I will make again, but halve the cloves. I also liked another reviewer's suggestion of using part brown sugar and adding vanilla. I'll try those changes next time as well. Very moist, very satisfying cookie. I used half butter/half applesauce and replaced half the flour with buckwheat flour (for the nutrition and because I needed to use it up), and that seemed to work very well. Thanks for the recipe!

I gave this 3stars because I may have messed this up. I put vanilla in other than that I followed the recipe perfectly. My cookies were not nice looking at all, I can't imagine making these again.

Pretty good.  Reminds me of a pumpkin bread, but in a cookie.  The raisins and nuts are a must.  Would probably taste even better with an orange glaze on top.
