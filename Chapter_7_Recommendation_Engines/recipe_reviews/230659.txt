This was a fabulously healthy vegetable dish!  I did do a couple of things different though.  I bought honeycrisp apples and I cored and diced them, but left the healthy skin on.  This added nutrients and color!  I also omitted the salt and pepper and added 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar to the olive oil. I let them roast for 30 minutes as I like them browned a little bit.  And when I added the raisins and walnuts I also added about 1/2 oz of crumbled feta cheese for just a slight zip.  I then divided it into individual serving dishes to pack for my lunches.  This will be a staple in my diet for sure!

My wife and I really loved this recipe and will definitely do it again.  I used dry cranberries we had on hand rather than raisins.  Rather than drizzle oil on, I prefer to add the oil and seasoning in a bowl and mix everything.  Everything else was pretty much as instructed.

I didn't like brussels sprouts when I was young.  The ones my mother served were always frozen ones that were then boiled.  Now my wife and I always start with fresh ones and roast them.  They are so much better.

so i did modify it a little because i didn't have any white wine. I used a balsamic vinegar reduction in it's place and it was MARVELOUS. I also added the walnuts with about 15 minutes to go to make them crunchy. Superb! thank you!

I love this, I have had it more than once. I make it on the stovetop in a wok.  I use garlic with the EVOO and in place of the wine I use Pomegranate juice. I also throw in some sweet and sour cabbage. In place of the walnuts I use cashews. Serve it over rice.  I could sit and eat till it's gone.

Holy cow!  This was SO DELICIOUS!  I absolutely loved it.  I try very hard to do recipes the first time the way they are presented.  The only glitch here was I only had regular raisins.  Otherwise - with my fresh from the garden brussel sprouts - this recipe was made the way they posted it and was couldn't-stop-eating-it perfect!!  THANK YOU SO MUCH!  NEW FAVORITE!

I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it.  Since I was serving both Roast Beef and Turkey Breast (for the non-meat eaters) this was the perfect combination of vegetables.  I was serving 10 adults so i adjused the recipe accordinly and used golden raisins and dried cranberries which added some much needed color.
Will definately make this again!

We thought this was absolutely delicious.  Just kept eating it till it was all gone.  It was a great combination of flavors. Didn't add the wine at the end... not needed.

This was a hit with my entire family; I will definitely make again! Adjustments that I made (mostly based on the contents in my cupboards): I used an entire head of cauliflower (had to get used); pinor noir instead of white wine (and added in with all other ingredients), pecans instead of walnuts and left out the raisins but added in 6 strips of uncooked bacon to the mixture before cooking. Cooked at 450 for 30 mins (like another reviewer, I like the veggies a bit browned).

delicious! I had no cauliflower so just left it out, used dried cranberries for the same reason. For the olive oil I had some blood orange olive oil and did the rest the same and it was so good and healthy. Will definitely make again.

This was a very easy and healthy dish that pairs well with most anything or can be enjoyed on it's own! After reading the reviews I added some balsamic vinegar to my olive oil mixture. I also added cranberries but still used golden raisins as well. Some feta was also tossed in at the end with the cranberries and raisins.  So delicious and would be great to serve at the holidays too!!  Hubby does not typically like Brussels but gobbled this dish up :)

I have made this twice...the first time our power went out and I had to make it from memory and cook it on the BBQ...somehow I forgot the apples and it was still great. The second time with power I followed the recipe including the apples and loved it.  I cut the brussel sprouts in quarters and cover the bowl after cooking to let everything steam

I thought this was a good recipe.  The raisins and apples added some nice sweetness to the brussel sprouts.  I left out the cauliflower, because I didn't have any, and I'm not a fan.  I didn't used to like brussel sprouts either, but recipes like this one are helping me make them more often.

I didn't have wine, so I substituted  a little Balsamic vinegar. Roasted a little longer than stated time. Very creative dish, as well as nutritious. Family raved and asked me to please make again.

Interesting combo that turned out totally yummy!  Even the young teenager liked it!  Pair it up with some high quality brown rice and the "Zippy Summer Shrimp" (here on AllRecipes.com) and you'll look like an amazing cook -- and... Oh So Easy!

This was great. Didn't change a thing although I do think one of the recommendations about adding a little fresh ginger would work well. We could have eaten this as a main dish.

I had high hopes for this recipe.  Many reviews stated people that don't like brussel sprouts loved it....not so with my family.  I thought it was ok, but family members that weren't fans of the little cabbages still didn't like it. I roasted it a little longer like a few people suggested.  I also substituted basamic vinegar for the wine.

This was a big hit. The addition of the apples and raisins adds to the sweetness brought out by roasting the vegetables. Made it twice in one week, increasing ingredients to have more leftovers.

Definitely would make it again.  My family raved and they are not usually all that keen on most vegetables.  The sweetness of the apples and raisins were perfect to mellow out the brussel sprouts.

We enjoyed this with a hint of sweetness.  I only had one apple and regular raisins and substituted broccoli for cauliflower.  We also added pearl onions - very tasty side dish!

I followed the recipe exactly & thought it was okay.  I guess I prefer my Brussels sprouts more crisp; I agree with the review that they turned out soft and mushy.

We love roasted Brussels sprouts and I'm always looking for  great new ways to prepare them. This was a hit! I did as another reviewer advised and added the unpeeled apples halfway through the 30 minute oven time, which was perfect.  I didn't have cauliflower, didn't miss it either. I subbed pecans for walnuts because that's what was on hand. Delicious!

I thought the recipe was horrible. I cooked it longer than what was called for. Other than that I changed nothing. The Brussels sprouts were soggy because of apples. I would not make this again.

I thought that this was a very well balanced recipe. The tart and the sweet mingled nicely to create a wonderful dish. I scaled this back to three servings and subbed pecans for walnuts, not a fan of walnuts, otherwise I made this as written. Outstanding recipe that I will be making again. Thanks for sharing.
Update. I made this again and used aged balsamic instead of the wine.  Great recipe that I will be making frequently with different seasonings.

It is slightly embarrassing how addicted I am to this recipe.  I make it roughly as is, but exclude the cauliflower (not a fan) and just chop the apples with skins on (I'm a lazy chopper and don't mind the extra texture).  This was really my first experiment with making Brussels sprouts and it turned out to be a huge win... the interesting flavors combined with the high level of protein in Brussels sprouts (who knew?!) quickly made this a go-to for the nights where I am craving an all-veggie (i.e. fast, easy, no-defrost-necessary) evening meal.

Instead of roasting the veggies in the oven, I cooked these in our gas grill. I used a grill basket and tossed the veggies twice during the cooking time. Some of the sprouts were a little too crunchy, but otherwise it worked really well. I used two Gala apples and didn't peel them; I substituted dried cranberries for the golden raisins and used balsamic vinegar instead of the wine to finish the dish. Will definitely make this again.

I could not get past the taste of the brussel sprouts in this...that part was gross (not to sound like a 5 year old). But everything else was good!
Maybe I can leave out the brussel sprouts next time... :-\ Yeah, I'm 36 and I still HATE brussel sprouts. :D

Wow, this was delicious and healthy.  I have been looking for a new side dish for Thanksgiving dinner that was low in carbs.  There seems to be so few, but this one fit the bill.  The blend of vegetables, fruit, and nuts was different but worked really well together.  I mixed everything in a bowl to distribute the olive oil more evenly.  I was pretty liberal on the oil, salt, pepper, and walnuts.  I used dried cranberries instead of raisins just because I had so many.  Did not add wine.  Feta cheese at the end as suggested by Sandy sounds delicious and I will try that next time to attract more fans of a Brussels Sprouts dish.

This was a great recipe and I don't like Brussel sprouts! I altered it just a bit to suit my taste. I tossed the veggies in bacon grease and olive oil before baking. Near the end of cooking I added the apples as suggested by another reviewer and crumbled bacon. What doesn't taste good with bacon? Topped with pecans, forgot the raisins, and didn't have the wine. Turned out pretty good, but I bet the raisins and wine would have been tasty too.
