It's a perfect go-to recipe as - is.  I recently tripled it, put everything in the blender (used whole cloves of garlic) blended and poured.  Using the blender gave a more even coating of spices (especially the chili flakes). Perfect marinade.  Use any chicken cut  you like, I've used thighs, and breasts both with skin on/off.  I frequently precook for dinner parties and this is a favorite.  I marinated the breasts overnight, grilled fast and hot and load everything into an electric skillet.  Then I boiled the marinade, added chicken stock, then it is just heat and eat for tender, flavorful chicken with a grilled flavor but less work at party time.  Today I'll serve this with a greek salad, greek yogurt on the side (as a dip), good bread and wine.  Viola'

I love this marinade.  I used this on a big pack of chicken breasts.  I pounded the breasts and marinated overnight just because I didn't have time to cook them.  Grill them the next day.  With the leftovers I let them cool and I sliced the chicken on the diagonal for chicken strips.  I froze half of it to use later on salads, pita bread (gyros), etc.  The only slight difference was I used half oregano and half majoram.  I think I must have read that on his website.  I had the majoram on hand that I needed to use.  My new standard marinade!

Fabulous!!  I was only able to marinate our chicken for the minimum of 4 hours but the flavor was very evident.  I made NO CHANGES to this recipe.  My husband grilled this over a charcoal fire and I served it with a Greek salad--everyone loved it.  Saving this one--thanks Chef John once again!

As usual, Chef John does it again.  This chicken is delicious...I wouldn't change a thing in the marinade.   I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and thighs because that's all I had on hand and it still turned out beautifully.  I only had  3  1/2 hours to  marinate but that was plenty of time for the cuts I used.  Something in the marinade gave a wonderful crusted chicken effect - don't know why but it was great.  I served it with the chopped salad Chef John suggests in his video.  I added a bit of chopped cilantro and sprinkled it with some feta cheese.  Made quite a hit.   So simple .....I'll be making this often.

This marinade is fabulous!  I made it for a dinner party and used chicken breasts instead.  Let them marinate overnight and the end result was a deliciously tender and oh-so-flavorful entree.  Highly recommend!

Really good, but need to make just a few minor changes for next time. I need to use fresh garlic and lemon juice next time. Also, way better if it marinated overnight. Lastly, it takes a lot longer on the grill than it says so the drumsticks are not bloody.

Really good recipe, very Basic and Simple! Can adjust with various herbs to suit your tastes. The chicken quarters are great perfect serving with some Greek salad or cold pasta. Cant wait for Summertime Grilling this is going to be Awesome! Thank You Chef John! Love this version of chicken ..... the family enjoys this is so many ways and the leftovers are just as excellent.

Mild flavors but only marinated for 30 minutes.  Try again with proper 4 hour wait time.

This was an excellent recipe!  I used chicken thighs and drumsticks, but only because my family does not like chicken leg quarters.  I prepared the marinade in the morning and let the chicken marinate all day.  It was a big hit with the whole family!

This is simply fantastic. Neighbors living near me came out and asked for recipe on the basis of delicious cooking smoke.

That said...I have a abiding dislike of reviewers who modify the recipe (marinading for only 30 minutes instead of 4 hours) and then giving only 3 stars because of the bland taste.

This recipe is awesome. It doesnâ€™t need anything, but I would like to try it with that lemon yogurt condiment. No substitutions, this recipe shines as is. Thanks Chef John

Very easy to prepare. Followed recipe as stated except I baked the chicken at 400. Skin super crispy. BF and guests enjoyed. I used lemon greek yogurt and added diced cucumber, dill and hot sauce...it paired perfectly with the chicken. We also added a greek salad plus green beans with walnuts. Will definitely make again and maybe more spicy.

Awesome ! Be sure to work some of the marinade into the cuts in the chicken.  Also , grill LOW and SLOW, well beyond reqiured time. Just keep an eye on it. You will be rewarded for your patience.

This is an flavorful marinade that makes your mouth sing. I used chicken breasts and it was amazing. One suggestion is adding some lemon thyme in if you have it. I add a bunch when itâ€™s in abundance in the garden. Love this with Greek orzo salad.

I don't even like chicken and I like this recipe.  Easy to follow.  Good marinate, slow grilling is the key.  I've always grilled on high or medium high heat.  This low and slow method allows the skin on the chicken to melt into a thin paper and infuse the meat with flavor.  Thank you.

If you thought that this recipe had bland flavor notes, I'm betting that you didn't salt your chicken enough. I only changed a very few, mostly methodological, things and got amazing results:
1. I used used bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs.
2. I used white wine vinegar (nothing fancy, just a bottle I had in my cupboard from the local market). 
3. I used 7 cloves of garlic, crushed. 
4. I rubbed the oregano in my hand before adding to the marinade. I love releasing the oils in the oregano like this.  

I also used a good extra virgin olive oil.

The smell of the marinade was amazing, the lemon, garlic, and oregano come together  so nicely. 

I did a 5 hour marinade, the grilled result was a real hit in the family. This is a keeper.

This second time came out great as the first...fabulous! All I changed was adding a little salt in the marinade. BTW, I served it with the AR Greek Pasta Salad I and grilled carrots. They were very complimentary. Oh, as for a picture, it was devoured before I remembered to take one. Everyone got really hungry with the aroma coming from the grill. Nuf said

This was the best, juiciest, tender grilled chicken.  I made it exactly as written, except for the garlic. I was out of fresh garlic so I used a tablespoon of garlic powder.

Am I the only person thinking it needed salt? I canâ€™t believe I didnâ€™t catch it has no salt in the recipe.

Wonderful!  I did not have the leg/thigh pieces, but used thighs alone and it was excellent.  Will definitely make this again and will try it with boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Probably won't be as good, but perhaps a bit more healthy!!

Marinated the chicken for a few hours.  Not bad, but I wouldn't make it again.

The is excellent; although a little too much on the spicy side. Reducing the hotness would be just as good as well.

I did not make any changes. This was good, but did not have the "wow" factor that I was expecting. My husband liked it more than I did, so I ended up averaging the two and giving it four stars.

This was good...and fairly easy to make, but think I preferred the lemon-yogurt recipe with harissa sauce when I am think grilled Mediterranean chicken.  Still good and easy and much better than standard grilled chicken.
