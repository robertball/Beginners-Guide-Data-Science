Great marinade! I used this for bone-in pork chops that I marinated overnight. So tender and flavorful! The only thing I will do differently next time is add some salt as we thought it really needed it. This is a definite keeper YUM! Thanks for sharing.:)

Wonderful marinade. I used it on boneless pork ribs that my husband grilled and it was a hit. Half of the ribs were eaten before I could bring them back into the kitchen! Salty/sweet Asian type flavor.
