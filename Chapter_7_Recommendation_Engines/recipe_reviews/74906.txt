Followed recipe but added some extra veggies, tons of garlic and stuck my hand held mixture right in the pot to puree all the veggies.  Don't seive the veggies, that's the best part for the flavor.  I also used the soup for a pork chop recipe the next day (didn't have canned cream of mushroom), and it was very tasty.  I have some left in the freezer, not sure if it'll hold, but we'll see.  So remember, keep the veggies in it and just use one of those immersion blenders and puree everything right in the pot!

This soup turned out beautifully. I chopped all vegetables very small and left all in the soup. I froze half, and will write more when I see how well it freezes.
Later...I do not recommend freezing this soup, as the stock and the milk seemed to separate and, although it tasted fine, it did not look as nice.

Used original poster's updated suggestion to puree the vegetables and add them back to the soup.  Other than that the only thing I did differently was to use butter instead of margrine, which we never use.  The second time I made this I used a pinch of red pepper and twice the carrots, just to use up what I had.  Both times were divine, and I intend to make this often!

I haven't used the recipe yet, but will today.  I don't want 32 servings so 8 servings modified would have this math.

Divided by 4 for 8 servings
3 quarts =  1.5 cups (approx 1 can stock)
3 pound = 6 oz
½ pound = 1 oz
1 Cup = 2 Tbs
1 Tbs = 1/3 Tsp
1 Tsp = 1/8 tsp

A delicious and easy recipe! I sauteed the veggies in the butter, added the flour and salt (I also added pepper and about a clove of minced garlic) to create roux. I slowly added the milk and then added this mixture to the stock. This is a great recipe...much better than canned soup! I didn't even bother to strain it! Thanks for the post!

I got this recipe from a place I used to work, and after publishing it for everyone I found out that they made it a little differently. Instead of straining the vegetables and finding something else for them to go in, I reccommend using a blender or food processor to puree them. (I discard about 1/2 of the celery beacuse the taste is too strong for my liking.) Perfect!

Freezes well with a few changes. Easy and delicious! I made this recipe with the intention of freezing it because I had a large surplus of celery. Since creamy soups often separate in the freezer, I changed the process to eliminate this problem. To make the recipe quicker, I pulsed the celery and onion (carrots, also, though I left them out as I didn't have any at the time) in batches in my food processor until it was a fine chop. I then added it to the pot along with the stock and cooked the veggies until tender (leave out the milk, flour, butter at this step). I like the added texture of the celery, so did not sieve any out(no need to blend it because I already used the food processor). Once cooled, I froze soup in 2 cup portions. To finish, I thaw the soup and add it, while whisking, to a roux of about 2 Tbsp Butter and 2 Tbsp flour. Let simmer until it begins to thicken, then slowly add an equal portion of milk (2 cups) while stirring. Let simmer without boiling a couple minutes until creamy. Salt and pepper to taste.

Good starter recipe, but like many others I cannot bear to strain out the veggies -- so I just blended them into the soup.  I used half the broth/milk the recipe called for, no margarine, and a little heavy cream for extra creaminess at the end.  Also added in a little extra sage and a dash of nutmeg -- very good, but you have to love celery to like it.  Luckily, I do love celery!

A ten minute soup doesn't sound like it would be that flavorful, so I cooked it for an hour as I usually do. I thickened differently too by sauteeing the celery in evoo for a bit and then added the flour to make a roux. In this case, I like a smoother soup, so I followed the recipe and strained out the onion and celery, however, I put the soup back into the pot and added carrots for color and continued cooking until the carrots were tender. I felt this needed additional seasonings, so I added my usual garlic/onion powders, parsley and dill. Hubby is eating it now and is more than pleased. Thanks for a good start!

This soup was amazing!  I will never go back to canned celery soup again.  I used more onions so it was more like an onion/cream of celery soup. I omitted the carrots since I didn't have them on-hand. Also, I pureed everything (instead of sifting) to make it thicker and tastier. I will make this again.

I loved this easy recipe!!  I had a lot of celery and carrots left over from holiday relish trays and I got a food processor for Christmas so I put it to good use and made this soup - yes I used carrots in it too but it was excellent!!  My family couldn't get enough!

The poster was correct - even those who don't like celery will love this soup. My husband is one of them.  I used 1 lb carrots and 1 large onion in addition to the celery. I used "better than bouillion", 13 tsp for 3 quarts water. After adding veggies to boiling broth, I melted one stick of butter in a small skillet, added in 1.5 tsp salt, pepper to taste, and let the butter brown for a minute over medium heat, then added in about 3/4 cup flour to make roux. Added the roux to the boiling veg/broth, boiled for about 15 minutes, then turned to low and simmered until dinnertime...about another 30 minutes.  Fabulous aroma, comforting creamy flavor. I served it with toasted whole grain bread and a small balsamic vinaigrette salad.

This is so delicious, you won't be able to back to the canned stuff!  I needed a recipe for cream of celery, that I could convert to gluten free, and this fit the bill perfectly! The taste is wonderful, and like others, I left the veggies in, and just whizzed the soup with my immersion blender.  Fantastic results.  Since I needed it in "condensed" form, to use in a casserole, I just decreased the stock to 1.5 qts.  Perfection.  Thank you for sharing!

Lucky me!  I needed celery soup for another casserole recipe.  I eat organic, and I could not find canned organic celery soup... so I found this, the one and only straight up celery soup on this site :)  Awesome recipe.  I, like others, couldn't do away with the solids, and I added roasted garlic and basil.  So, I not only get "better than canned" for the casserole, I have leftover soup to serve at other meals... and again... hats off, this is truly a simple and awesome recipe!  In the future, I will use this for other cream soups like mushroom or chicken.

This was better than I expected it to be, frankly. I wanted to try something different and was somewhat afraid my 4-year-old wouldn't like this, but I made it anyway. She and my husband both ate it readily, though our daughter didn't have seconds like we did. 
I followed the suggestion of others and blended the vegetables into the soup as suggested, but my hand blender couldn't puree the "strings" from the celery. The soup tasted fine, but it had a bunch of short celery strings in it. They didn't make the soup inedible, but it definitely had a strange texture. Next time I will either de-string the celery first or strain the soup before serving it.

We have found this simple soup is really good. We also use it in tuna cassoroles, base for other soups and Melican Dinner. I decrease the liquid and make a concentrate to add to other recipes.

I had some extra carrots and celery left over from another recipe that I wanted to use up.  This recipe was perfect for that.  It seemed like it was lacking in the spices, so I added cayenne, sage, garlic powder, and a touch of all-spice.  Really did the trick!  Served with grilled cheese (cheddar and cream-cheese).  My husband said it was the best lunch EVER!

I make for 32servings and freeze it .It doesn't last too long as my kids and Grandkids take half a dozen away each time they come to visit.
I Blend the Veg into the soup using a hand stick. 
Being Scottish I just can't let all these lovely vegetables be thrown out.

Loved the soup.  I pureed the vegetables as well, and returned them to the soup.  For extra seasoning I added a packet of goya sazon, coriander & annatto.  It gives the soup a nice color and taste.  Awesome, thanks for a great recipe.  So easy!

I made this soup this evening, and it turned out well.  I did, however, cut the recipe into about one-third the original serving amount;  I also used more than two cups less broth than the recipe called for, and the soup still turned out a bit thin once I puréed it in my Vitamix blender... which was fine since we had a crusty baguette to sop up the soup.
My recommendation is to sauté the vegetables (including some chopped/minced garlic, to your taste) before adding the liquid to the pot and heating everything through, as one reviewer stated earlier.  And if you like your soup thick and creamy, remember to use less liquid and/or purée only part of the soup.

I read several reviews before making the soup. Some said the soup was too thin. So for 8 servings, I added 1/4 cup more flour. I also added 2 cloves of garlic. I didn't measure the chopped vegetables but guessed at the amounts. After the soup cooked, I pureed the vegetables leaving a few larger chunks. The soup was delicious.   The reason I tried this recipe was because the celery was getting a little old but was still fine for use in cooking. I had forgotten about it as it was in the back of the refrigerator. A few stalks were slightly frozen. Using celery for soup uses up all those extra parts that often get thrown away. Though I sometimes use them to make vegetable stock.

Awesome!  I was looking for a nice, light soup and also something to use up a head of celery that I'd forgotten about.  I made a few changes:  I used 1 head of celery, 1/2 a bag of baby carrots, chopped, 1 heaping tablespoon of chopped garlic, and a large spanish onion.  I used 2 boxes of chicken broth and skim milk as that was what I had.  As soon as I added the milk, I wished I had waited and added it at the end (if you are boiling milk you have to stir constantly so it doesn't scorch at the bottom!).  Cooked over medium heat for 15 minutes, remove and ran the soup in batches through my blender.  Next time i think I'm going to turn it into a celery, potato, and carrot cream soup and add about 4 large potatoes, cook in the broth till tender, and add 2 cups of heavy cream at the end, rather than milk.  Thanks for the nice recipe!

This was awesome!  I don't have a kitchen scale so I used 3 heads of celery and assumed it was equivalent to 3 #'s, still don't know how many heads of celery should be used.  Some others commented that this didn't freeze well because of the milk.  I cooked it for 10 minutes without adding the flour, milk, etc.  I used my Blendtec blender to make soup of the veggies, froze half the recipe and finished the other half in the pot.  It turned out very rich tasting even though I used skim milk.

I love soup and this one is great and a keeper.  I changed to 8 servings and used "College Inn culinary broth - White Wine & Herb".  I also had two small potatoes that were about to root.  I cooked the potatoes in the mirowave first and then just mashed all the veggies right in the pan.    I paired with Crescent Bacon-Cheddar Pinwheels and loved it!  It's a great meal for a brunch or ladies bunko.

This is a VERY mild soup, which was exactly what I wanted to make for my elderly father who was recovering from surgery. I used water instead of chicken stock and a gluten-free baking mix instead of wheat flour. I let mine simmer a bit longer because I wanted the vegetables to be extra soft. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I left the vegetables (which I had chopped very small) in the soup and just ran the stick blender through the pot enough to puree some, leaving a good number of chunks. The soup was delicious and allowed the celery to take a starring role.

Great example that there are excellent recipes on AR that do not have necessarily have hundreds of reviews. Outstanding and very easy. Perfect for the time when you have lots of left over celery. Adapted to smaller scale, followed some previous suggestions - extra carrots, garlic, sage/nutmeg, and sautéing veggies early on. So glad I tried it. Will make it again. Thanks for a keeper

Just finished this great soup. I re-portioned it to be 4 servings and used half an onion, two medium carrots, 7 stalks of celery, and 5 large cloves sweet garlic. Like others, I used an immersion blender to puree about half of the veggies when it was done cooking. Sooo delicious, very sweet flavor, like potato soup without the weird, annoying potatoes. Served with baked tortillas, which ended up tasting like saltines. Overall very satisfying and easy on a cold evening!

Cream of celery soup always reminds me of my Great-Grandmother it was something she often made when I was spending the night. Lovely recipe, I leave out the carrots and leave in the celery, just chop it extra fine. Thank you for the recipe!

I felt the instructions should be a bit clearer as it is definitely not a 10 minute soup.  I cooked until veggies were tender about 45 minutes.  I added a clove of garlic too.  Then strained the veggies and pureed them in the food processor and returned to pot.  I found strings from the celery, so then decided to strain to remove the strings.  I used butter and raw milk, so the cream in the milk made it very  creamy.  It is a keeper for sure.  I made it to really cook with, but love sipping from a mug with warm cornbread too.

My husband thought this was just ok.  I added more salt and it was pretty darn good.  I cut the recipe down to 6 servings.  Our dinner guests loved it and finished every drop.  Amazing what a difference a little more salt makes.  I added a touch of cornstarch because it was too thin.

Please make the soup per the recipe. It is ABSOLUTELY one of the best soups I've made AS DIRECTED. No extra this, less that, or puree the vegetables . Just like it says. Strain it, and it's beautiful.

Am thoroughly enjoying this soup. Nice and creamy. I used cold milk, not hot to mix with the flour. I added some Velveeta cheese to the soup once it was bubbling again and I did not strain out the veggies.  Ummmm...delicious.

Strain out the vegetables? This recepe leaves me flabbergasted to think that the best ingredients are being discarded before serving! At least there is plenty of fodder for the compost bin.

Not altogether TERRIBLE, but not very good, either, it lacks a lot of flavor, even when the vegetables are left in. If you're looking for a legitimate cream of celery soup, I would suggest taking out the stock completely and using a chicken bouillon or other chicken soup base equal to the amount of milk used (so, 1 tsp bouillon per cup of milk). Starting with a roux with the margarine/butter and flour, then pouring in milk and letting boil for a minute to thicken, and after thickening adding your cooked and partly pureed veggies to your taste. This recipe was WAY too brothy. Use something else!

Tasty soup. I added garlic and allowed more time for the veggies to become tender before blending the soup straight off the stove top without straining anything. A also used butter instead of margarine and had to adjust the salt to taste. I may use half and half or at least whole milk next time for a thicker creamier taste.

As a celery lover I loved this soup and will make it again and again. But I made some changes though. I didnt strain the veggies, I made it pure with a handblender. I cooked the butter and flour seperately until they got light brown and add them as the last thing... Yum yum yum. Thank you for the recipe.

Had a craving for Celery soup today and I came across this recipe. I pretty much followed the recipe as is, but I added some extra corn at the end for some texture. It came out super tasty :) DH even suggested the addition of potatoes next time, which I'll have to try! This turned out to be more of a "Vegetable Chowder", and I'll be making it again soon :)

Proving that simple is better. This soup turned out awesome! Based on another review, I used a hand mixer to puree the vegetables rather than sieving them out. I would be thrilled to be served this soup in a restaurant. Excellent and easy. Thanks for sharing!

A really nice recipe that I gave four stars for two reasons: the soup would have been nicer a little thicker and the veggies definitely needed to be pureed.  The taste was phenomenal but the consistency was off with chunks of celery and thin broth. Will make again with these two adjustments.

Love this soup.  Great way to use up celery. Made 1/3 recipe and it came out smooth and full of flavor. It will thicken when it sits out for a few minutes.

This was so delicious!  And I was just looking for a way to use a bunch of celery. My modifications: I divided everything by 3 since I was only making for 2 people -- it still lasted us 3 meals; 2% milk worked fine; butter instead of margarine; after boiling, I let it cool a bit and then blended in 2 batches, then strained through a sieve.  I was left with a smooth, rich tasting soup.  My husband thought it tasted like clam chowder or cream of mushroom and couldn't guess it was celery.  Will definitely make again!

This was good but not as rich and creamy as I would have liked. Next time, I will add some half and half. Like other reviewers, I left the veggies in, and put the soup through the blender. Thanks!

I'm not a huge celery fan to begin with, but my husband requested cream of celery soup.  I thought it was okay; he thought it was just a little bit better than okay.  We ended up chopping the vegetables small and keeping them in the soup, which made it heartier.  I would say it's a good recipe if you are a celery fan.

Note: One standard bunch of celery stalks is about 1.5lbs (minus leaves and the base).  I used skim milk and half the amount of butter / margarine, and it was still creamy and tasty.  I did not strain out the vegetables because they are good for you!  Another alternative would be to puree the soup before serving.

I made it tonight with garden grown celery and it was delicious.  I tried a bowl first with the chopped veggies in it which was very good.  Then I put another bowlful in the blender and that was very creamy and delicious.  Instead of all milk I used half cream as that's what I had on hand.  Making a third of this recipe works well as you use .985 mL (1 quart of broth and milk), 1 lb. of celery and a third of each other item. Super easy.

I needed a recipe to use all my celery before it went bad & this is what I found. I blended the vegetables in the food prosessor & added them back to the soup, because I prefer a thicker soup. The celery didn't blend so well & I thought I was going to have to strain it but it tastes really good. Also celery soup should be mainly green, but after blended the veggies there was some orange in there from the carrots, still mainly tasted like celery but the color threw me off at first, so maybe if I make this again I'll only blend the celery. I used 4 cups milk instead of 6, to keep it thick. Also added cooked brown rice I had left from another meal I cooked today & it was really good.

This is so tasty and so easy!  It really has undertones of Thanksgiving dressing, which makes me happy.  It's a great recipe to have on hand when you have a recipe that calls for a small amount of celery and you need something to do with the leftovers. Like most people, I found it easier and tastier to just use a handheld blender and puree the soup (leaving a few chunks).  I just sliced the carrots instead of julienning them.  It's wonderful with croutons sprinkled all over the top!

Yum!  I added a little garlic powder, onion powder, and Italian seasoning, then used an immersion blender to puree it.

Made this soup 3 times in 2 wks. My 6 yr old son,who don't like vegetables, actually eat the celery & carrots! He will not touch it if it is cooked in other methods. I followed shannon's suggestion by first sauteed the vegetables in butter, add the flour then milk to thicken it before pouing into the stock. I did not remove the vegetables, like it that way. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe! It's super easy, and it turned out great! The only thing that I changed was I ended up blending the soup instead of straining out the vegetables.

This soup rocks.  I bought a whole bag of celery thinking I'd substitute those for my usual potato chips come snack time... totally didn't happen.  This soup was a great (tasty!) alternative use of all that celery.  I scaled down and used 4 cups stock, 1lb celery, 1 carton white mushrooms, and 2 cups 2% milk.  I also added thyme and 2tbsp fresh garlic, let everything simmer for 30-40 mins, and blended everything without straining.  Easy enough for even a busy med student. :)

I pureed my soup after cooking the vegetables.  Then I strained the thickness out (gave it to my dogs, they loved it).  I put everything back into the pot and added 1 cup of heavy cream (instead of 6 cups of milk).  Yum!

cut down to 8 servings. be sure to peel the celery first. added a few cloves of garlic. pressure cooker for 10-15, then puree with immersion blender. added milk, butter, flour. then added white pepper, coriander, sage, tarragon, a bay leaf, salt and black pepper. A dash of creole seasoning and about two tbs of bacon drippings. bring to boil, reduce to simmer. added chopped hearts of celery on top. turned out excellent.

I needed to use up some celery before it spoiled, so I thought this recipe was perfect since it called for a lot of celery.  Because I didn't read the adjustable servings first, I ended up with 32 servings of a soup we didn't love.  Learned a lesson here!  :(

I really enjoyed this soup... I added too much pepper (chef's error) but overall it was a great soup! I was not sure if I'd like it but I pureed it I loved the consistency! Perfect for a spring night! I served it with Garlic Cheese Texas Toast!

This was a very good soup, I did feel it was a bit bland though.  I put my veggies in a blender and chopped them up really fine so I did not strain mine.  (I couldn't see wasting all that veggie goodness :) )

Don't make my mistake of substituting butter for margarine.  It was awful and I had to through away the whole batch.  I put three stars because I really can't rate the recipe, but thought I would share my experience so others don't make the same error.  Lesson learned!

To suzi below-to divide the recipe u can use the automatic serving calculator-very handy feature-the 3 quarts divided by 4 should be 3 cups stock (not 1 1/2) great recipe though.

I made the recipes as written and then melted a little bleu cheese at the end. It was divine. Next time I will add some heavy cream to make it thicker and possibly cook it a little longer for a deeper flavor. I'm not a very talented cook but I must say, I made a beautiful soup tonight! Thank you Wonderfalk for sharing!

Mmmmmmmm mmmmmmm! I made this with soy milk instead of milk as my son is allergic and added some garlic and cilantro. Oh, and as other users suggested, did not strain but rather pureed everything together. Fabulous!

I blended the vegetables into the soup instead of straining them.  Might as well get the extra fibre. Also, I prefer to use a vegetable stock rather than chicken.

This is the best soup.  When I make it, it tastes like it came from a really high end restaurant.  I have made it many times.  I puree the veggies in the blender.

Mmmmm, this soup is really good!!  I didn't expect it to taste so rich and creamy (while knowing it is so good for me).  I was surprised to discover I didn't have any chicken broth so I added some vegitable water (from steaming vegi's that I collect in the freezer) and that was fine.  I can't wait to give to my husband who claims to dislike soup.  After his bicycle ride home through the snow, I think he'll love it.

This recipe was a great jumping off point.  I had a bunch of celery I needed to use up, and found this recipe.  I halved it, and also added a couple diced potatoes, but pretty much followed it line by line.   I did use butter instead of margarine, and made a roux with it and the flour before adding it to the pot.  VERY GOOD.  

Oh ya...I also mushed up the veggies and left them all in.  So it isn't a true "cream" soup I suppose, but I hated to waste them.

I added lots of garlic and sauteed all the veggies and garlic in butter instead.  After boiling altogether, I pureed all the veggies and added cream instead of milk and flour.  It came out delicious!

i thought this was very very good. i did have to make a few changes. i didn't have carrots. so i added some garlic cloves to the mix.  after boiling for the 10 minutes, i blended the whole thing.  do not strain the celery out. this is probably one of the best homemade cream soups i have made.  i used fat free skim milk and it was still very yummy. i would imagine that with whole milk or some cream, it would be even better.

Like what everyone says, this is a really easy recipe to work on. I read as much feedback from other reviewers and made some modifications. 
- I chopped all my vegetables finely and didn'puree or blend it. I peeled the celery since I don't like the strings. 
- I didn't add any margarine.
- I didn't add any salt as there's already a lot of sodium in the chicken stock. Didn't add in the white pepper either.
- For the milk, I put in 50% half-and-half (cold) and mix it with the flour. The remaining 50% of the milk comes from regular milk which I heated according to the recipe. 
- My soup may be too plain for many but I sure love it and will make it again!

Fabulous! I used the tops and hearts of 2 bunches of celery and I blended the soup to make it creamy. Also used 1% milk to cut calories. I LOVED IT!

Good and easy. But a little bland. I added white wine and that helped.  I tried it before I blended the vege's into the broth and it did have a better flavor without the vege's, just so you know. If you keep the vege's you'll want to add more salt. 

I drzzled olive oil with more white wine when I served. 
Thanks for the easy recipe! 

It would be good as an appetizer, but not as a meal.

I've only ever made this recipe when another recipe calls for cream of celery soup and I have none on hand, but it has turned out great every time; in fact, I think those recipes were much better off without the canned stuff!  I don't understand why you would want to strain out the vegetables, though - aren't they the best part of the soup?

I usually find that with 4 or better star rating with more than 100 reviews the recipe is great, but in this case, it was truly not worth the effort!  First, I needed 2 large pots because it overflowed.  This recipe is enough to feed an army.  Second, given the qualities it was a lot of trouble and the soup was mediocre at best.  Would not make again, and will continue to look for another recipe.  The only reason I did not give it 1 star is that you could eat it, it was ok.

Very good!  I also chose to keep the veggies!  I also chose not to blend them.  I prefer my soup to have more texture.  Plus, with the added texture, it would be very easy to add ham for some added protein.

I omitted the carrots, but added chopped broccoli stalks instead. Once the veggies were well cooked, I removed them from the stock and used a hand blender to turn them into a mush. Then I added them back to the stock. It made enough for countless meals. And delicious! Steve.

Just whipped this up and taking a mug to bed for a nap (had our first snow today to time to hibernate).    First of all, for those who might think to skip this step, putting it through the sieve is a must as the celery is very stringy and you want that out of the soup. I pressed as much liquid and flavour out as possible, even ran it through a mixer to get as much goodness out as I could. Ndefinately worth the step as you now have a velvety smooth soup. Topped it with some grated garlic sea salt and it's OH SO YUMMY!!

I had a thing of celery that was going soft and just had a brocoli soup last week that I loved so thought we'd try celery soup. I cut amounts to make 1 qt instead of 4. Not sure how many veggies I used, just used what I had. Oh I microwaved the carrots for amin to soften them prior to cooking, my celery was already soft. Set the timer for 5 min to stir again since it said boil for 10....Oops it boiled over and half my liquid is on the stove top. Took what was left and blended it anyway to a smoothie consistency. Taste test and its pretty good. My daughter thinks it looks like a smoothie setting in the blender still so hopefully she'll love it at dinner in a few....

I always read tons of reviews before I make a recipe, and this time it really paid off. Immersion blend your soup, for sure. Makes it creamy without adding any additional fat! 

I went the path of sauteeing the veggies (including carrot and garlic) in a little butter and EVOO until tender, then I poured in about a cup of water, put the lid on, and let them steam and get really soft. I added the rest of the water (6C total) and 2T. Better Than Bouillon paste. I think that's a key ingredient because it's so much tastier than plain chicken stock from a box or can. I didn't need to add any salt or other spices. I made this to freeze, so I omitted the roux, and as the soup is now, it's divine. Really doesn't need the fat and carbs of the flour, butter, and milk. I can see using this as a sauce for broiled fish or in casseroles to add flavor. Really delicious. I do plan to try the creamy version, too!

I recalculated the servings to 4, and made this soup, but did NOT discard the vegetables. Instead, I allowed the soup to cool to "warm," put it into a food processor and pureed the vegetables with the soup, then reheated to serve. This yields a richer flavor and was really wonderful!

It truly is a delicious cold night style soup.  I left in the veggies and added extra butter. I think that comes from the PA Dutch in me needing tons of butter. We had this with Salmon Cakes. It was an interesting combination that I may try again.  A recommend to anyone with little ingredients needing something warm and healthy.

This was EXCELLENT and amazingly easy to prepare. LOVED the taste and texture. To make it simpler I cut the recipes in 1/2, chopped up the celery, SHREADED the carrots and 1 large onion, added 4 cloves of garlic. Boil for 10 min, than simmer on low heat for 10min. This made the soup thick and hearty in taste (without the need to puree or strain). We added chicken and fresh parsley to the leftovers ....result...SUPER YUMMY...not a drop left!!!!

Amazing soup!  

Leave the veggies in and puree and add a little garlic powder.  With those changes this soup turns into a FIVE STAR SOUP!!

This is my favorite Creme of Celery Soup recipe. I, too, add more veggies. I also use real, Amish, pesticide free Butter, never margarine. We avoid non-food in our diets.
I use this as the base for many other recipes instead of canned versions to improve nutrition and avoid chemicals. I do freeze it as I am not serving it as a soup, but, instead using it for making other dishes.

I enjoyed this soup. I made a smaller batch -- only 8 servings. I used one of those Knorr's chicken stocks which was great. I don't know what the other user was talking about, saying that using butter ruined the soup. I used butter and it was fine (I prefer the flavor over margarine). For me, this didn't have enough celery flavor, though, and so I added celery seed and celery salt (and some parsley). It was awesome! Also left the veggies in as I love them too much to remove. Delicious! With some modifications, in my humble opinion.

This was delicious. I left the veggies in and they can be left chunky or sliced finer, depending how you like it. I will definitely be adding more carrots and onions next time and might even end up experimenting with adding cheese and/or chicken.

Really simple and yummy - I know, I know that it is not always helpful when others tell you how they changed it but I am gonna tell you what I did anyway!  We added 1tsp garlic powder, and then emulsified it with one of those handy dandy hand mixers wands you see on the food network it came out nice and smooth and thick but not to thick =)

Thanks everybody. Followed the receipe with convienent scale down calculator for small number of family members. My girlfriend who cant stand celery, not only loved it, I had to limit the number of servings she helped herself too, so everybody arriving home later could get some. I did use the suggestion of using mash potatoe flakes to thicken the soap for each persons personal taste. The family all loved it and are asking when I'll make it again. Its a keeper, and inexpensive too make.

We love this soup!  I prepare it as a supper for my husband and I quite frequently, and we just eat it with some crushed up crackers.  The only thing I change is I leave out the margarine, and we blend the veggies in rather than straining. Yum!

I made this recipe gluten-free and dairy-free because of my son's allergies and it turned out very well. I threw all of the vegetables in the food processor before cooking because I planned to leave them in, then substituted plain rice milk for the milk and potato starch for the flour. I was making a reduced number of servings (8) and used 3T potato starch, but it could have used a bit more. The soup was very flavorful and I went on to use it to make tater tot casserole, one of our family favorites that we couldn't make with canned soup once we discovered his allergies. So thank you!!

Great recipe! Grew my own celery this year and cut the servings down to 8 which seems to ake a perfect sized batch of soup. I took the advice of a reviwer and put all the veggies through a food processor allong with garlic but do not remove them at the end. I also found that adding leftover bacon grease, few table spoons adds a great flavor.

Really nice and simple recipe. Puree the vegetables afterwards, as suggested. I added a little bit more white pepper, as well as a tiny bit of red pepper flakes, which added a nice warm flavor to each bite.

Ok, I changed this recipe quite a bit but.. I have to give it credit for giving me an amazing base to work with. My boyfriend said it was possibly in the top 20 best foods he's ever eaten, which is saying alot because he's a big foodie. I used chicken boullion cubes instead of broth (omitting the salt called for in the recipe). I also omitted the butter, as it was not needed. I pureed the veggies after soft boiling them in the broth, and then added them back. I also added some sage and a couple shakes of habenero powder. It was amazing. However, next time I will also try making the roux that some of the other reviewers made. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Very, very yummy soup.  The whole family loves it.  I don't take out the vegetables (best part!), I just take the hand-held electrical mixer and use it straight into the pot.  It tastes fantastic and has a lovely texture!  Thank you.

This was just okay.  Rather than toss everything in the pot together, I sauteed the onion, celery, and carrot in the butter until softened, then sprinkled the flour in and cooked until lightly browned.  I also used a tetra pak of mushroom broth and a can of evaporated skim milk in place of chicken broth and milk.  The flavor was good, but nothing unexpected.  Basically, it tasted like mushroom soup with celery chunks in it.  I'll contemplate some additions for a more complex flavor, but it was good on its own with some crusty bread -- just nothing I'll be craving anytime soon.

This was a good basic recipe.  I pureed the veggies but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Because I didn't "cook" the flour in a roux the first time around, the first batch tasted too floury.  I tried this again replacing the milk for cream, skipping flour altogether, and using 1/3 less broth and 1/3 less cream.  I prefer this soup with cream even though it's not as thick.

Great delicious recipe! We only used 4 tablespoons of butter, added more flour to make it thicker, and left the vegetables in and didn't strain it. It turned out great and delicious!

I didn't have any cream soups for a certain recipe, so I decided that it would take less time to make it than it would to go get it. Your recipe was delicious and I believe was better than what I could buy in a store. The only thing I would do is add more celery next time.

Followed recipe, adding same amount of mushrooms as celery and original poster's suggestion to puree the cooked veggies and add them back to the soup.  Then I USED THIS IN PLACE OF CAMPBELL's Cream of Celery, Cream of Mushroom, and Cream of Chicken soups in my Thanksgiving Dressing.  Added more salt to taste and will definately use again!  Thanks for posting!

I used an immersion blender to just puree the vegetables directly in the pot.  Without keeping the vegetables in, it seems like it would just be celery-flavored milk! The flavor was good, but I prefer my creamy soups to be a little thicker.  I will probably make again though.

I've been trying desperately -- for both nutritional and economic considerations -- to all but eliminate meat from my family's diet. And especially because this soup used all of the same ingredients I've always used when making my "meaty" soups (celery, carrots, onions, pepper, flavored stock, butter flour, etc.) I thought I'd try it. And I'm glad I did. I scaled the recipe to 10 and added a potato (as a thickener). After about 45 minutes, I pureed all of the vegetables. Even with the added potato, the soup was a bit thinner than we would have liked, so I lined all of our bowls with some PepperJack cheese, added a couple of crackers to mine and served my husband's and grown son's over some leftover Barley. Once we adjusted to "all that celery" (but, then again, isn't celery what a cream of celery soup is supposed to taste like?), we all agreed that if this is what it's going to be like being a vegetarian, it's OK by us. (PS: I made half the recipe in my soup pot for "immediate consumption" and tossed the rest of the ingredients into my CrockPot. BY REQUEST, I will be filling all lunch thermoses with this soup and serving it again tomorrow night. Now, THAT's a 5!)

Very delicious.  I might have added more than the amount of celery and carrots as I dont have a scale to weigh the amounts. It was thicker than I would have liked because of this. Very yummy and easy too.

Thanks for posting this recipe.  

Was too cheap to buy cream of celery soup to be used in a sauce for  salmon patties.  Scaled the recipe down to 4 servings. Reserved the amount needed for the salmon patty sauce and will use the remainder for something else.

I scaled this to 8 servings. Left out the margarine and the milk. Added half a cup of cottage cheese and left in all the vegatables.Pureed in the blender and it was excellent flavour.We love thicker soups, add a little extra stock if you find it too thick-enjoy.

We really enjoyed this soup!  It was great on Christmas Eve with some appetizers for a light meal before the Christmas day feast.  I cut the recipe in half, and cut the vegies by even more and then kept the vegies in the soup.  Even my 4yr old liked it.  Thank you for posting it!

After I had already added the chicken stock and started boiling the vegetables I realized the recipe made 32 servings. Wow, my largest pot was already almost full, so I had to improvise. I only used half of the rest of the ingredients (milk, flour, salt & pepper) and omitted the butter. I also blended the vegetables and re-added them to the soup. It was delicious! My family loved it. I think I'll make it like that again next time. Very yummy!

Wow, I can't believe how easy and how good this was, even without carrots, which I didn't happen to have any. I did add some garlic. Good way to use up celery. Like others, I also pureed the veggies and re-added them to the soup.

This is DELISH! The first time I ever had cream of celery soup was at this little restaurant in Port Aransas, TX. I immediately fell in love with it. It was so good. The first thing I did when I came home was look it up on this website(I'm addicted to this website by the way) and lucky for me there was a recipe for it. Only one though, but I didn't care as long as I got it. So tonight I made it, and it was exactly as I remembered it in the restaurant a month or two ago. This soup is a great appetizer. I served it with little toasted bread pieces. Yummy!

I just couldn't bring myself to throw away the veggies, so we ended up blending it.  We made it a day ahead and after sitting in the fridge for a day it was a very nice consistency and full of flavour.  My boyfriend loved it! Will make again.

Awesome recipe!  I've loved celery soup since I was a really little   kid.  I've never had homemade, in all those years!   This was super easy to make.  I did use butter because we never have margarine.   I also chose to just use my immersion blender because I  kinda like things with a little bite.  Overall, I will be making this again.  A previous poster said she used it in her tuna cassarole, which I'm making tomorrow and will do the same,  yummy!!

This is basically a good recipe but I had to make changes.  I agree with a previous reviewer about the waste of discarding the vegetables!   Just blend or use a hand mixer.  I made so many changes in the end that I'll be adding my own recipe to the site :-)

Very nice and creamy.  I adjusted the amount to 12 servings to make it more manageable and followed the suggestionsin most of the reviews, leaving the vegetables in.  I used the immersion blender to finish the soup and added some additional pepper (to taste) at the end.

I made a roux separately from rthe broth and vegetables.  I blended the vegetables in a blender then added the roux.  Then I blended everything together.  Actually liquefying it.  It turned out wonderful!!!

Being Hispanic and mostly cooking Cuban meals, I wasn't sure how much I would like this soup. However I have a living tower garden, and had lots of celery and didn't want it to go to waste.
So I looked up celery recipes and found this gem. I am now addicted to celery.
I cut back servings to 16 since I read cream soups don't necessarily freeze well.
I added a couple cloves of garlic. I sauteed all the veggies and spices in real butter. I used more butter than what was suggested. Before sauteing I minced all veggies in the food processor. 
Then added them to the milk and broth. I also used gluten free flour. Probably twice the amount only because I wanted it creamer. Everyone loved it,even my picky 3 year old granddaughter. Needless to say I'm growing more celery.  This is now one of my favorite recipes.

I love how easy it is to play with this recipe! I had a half pound of celery, so worked out the conversions and cooked more or less according to directions.  I saw curry powder in my cupboard, and thought why not? Love it!

Excellent basic recipe!  I live alone so I always make small portions of recipes.  Used this as my base and cut it down to 1/4 cup margarine, 1 cup chopped celery, 3/4 cup chopped carrots, 4 chopped green onions (all sautéed in the butter in the bottom of the soup pot until tender); pepper and salt to taste, 1 cup chicken stock (I make my own without salt) and 1 cup Greek vanilla yogurt (instead of milk).  When all had been put in pot and stirred, I poured it into my blender and pureed it well. I see no reason to strain out the veggies if you can just puree the heck out of them.  Poured it back into the pot and simmered it on low for about 20 minutes.  I also added a little red pepper (personal preference -- and gives it a kick).  The vanilla yogurt was JUST sweet enough to give it a very rich flavor (and an added 17 grams of protein as opposed to 8 in milk).  Will make this again for sure!

Flavor:  Excellent, mild, comforting.   DO NOT remove cooked veggies.  Boil longer, until tender, BLEND THEM UP.  I use a vita mix and put about 1 c cold milk in blender, added 2 c hot soup so it was reasonably warm, blended  up and served.  WHAT A HIT!   I made this with left over turkey stock and turkey drippings, no flour needed, and a little fat from the drippings replaced the butter.  1 qt. stock, 1 bunch celery, 3 carrots, about 2-3 c milk blended in 2 batches made about 8-10 servings.

This totally exceeded my expectations and is print worthy.  It is lick the bowl good.  My alterations:  I halved the recipe and stock was water with 1T poultry seasoning.  I then used homemade ricemilk, 1 potato, added 1T parsley and 1t dill.  I 
 then pureed in the pot.  That's it.  It was sooo good.  Creamy, rich, tasty, soothing and easy.

A neighbor gave me a five pound bag of frozen celery, and I'd been wondering what to do with it. 

So, this past Saturday, I whipped up a bucket of this soup and shared it with the neighbors. It's a delightful recipe, and everyone seemed to enjoy It. Good with homemade garlic bread and some nice wine. Oops, I see that I forgot the carrots, but, it still tasted good.

Using a couple of suggestions from others, I did not strain out the vegetables and I mostly used heavy cream.  Wow! I loved it, but next time I will use plain milk with a splash of cream. My version was rich. And I thought leaving in the veggies was masterful. I also added dried parsley, dash of hot sauce and a dash of nutmeg as others recommended. Good suggestions. Thank you. With the suggestions, I would rate as 5 Star.

Very good. Can take some more seasoning, to taste. Instinctively, I also couldn't bring myself to throw away all those veggies so I also puréed them and added them back. Note: this recipe calls for a LOT of liquid. Next time, I'd cut it all in half.

This was a great base recipe. I mostly followed it, except that I cut it in half, sauted 5 strips of bacon, added 3 cloves of garlic and some Italian herbs. The bacon added a great, smokey flavor. I followed other reviewers advice by blending it up instead of straining it out. I'll be making this again.

I have made this often and frozen the left overs in jelly jars for that i can thaw for each recipe what is needed! My kids are allergic to pre-made canned soup so this fits the bill for our needs... theirs time I’m going to half the liquid to make condensed soup!!! I’m sure it’s going to be great too!!!  I purée the veggies and put back into soup too!!!

I followed the recipe except for pureed the vegetables and put it back in and used butter instead of margarine.   It was very tasty.

Just made it, wonderful recipe, but I put all the veggies in a food processor to keep in the soup to add flavour, texture and fullness. Ended up being more filling, and celery straight from the garden made it all that much more.

Had a bunch of celery that needed to be used.  Hubby suggested that I make soup and I am glad I did.  Didn't think I would like it since I am very picky about my soups.  Didn't change a thing - made exactly by recipe.   Will certainly make again.

I enjoyed this soup and so did my daughter who is not a celery lover.  I made it the same way I make many soups by sauteeing the vegetables first in EVOO and them adding the stock, cooking , then puree and finish with the milk and flour.  I added thyme as well for more flavour. Excellent basic recipe though

Really like this recipe, however, I made a few changes. Made a roux with the margarine and flour, added the milk to it, allowed the flour to cook, then incorporated it into the cooking veggies mix. Followed some previous reviews and blended it up instead of straining. Didn't even have any leftovers by the end of the night. Thanks!

I was surprised that such a simple recipe made such a good soup.  I couldn't bring myself to strain out the vegetables so I puréed them and left them in the soup.  I also made a roux out of the butter and flour and then added the milk to heat and thicken before adding to the pureed vegetable mixture.  The flavour is mild, but tasty.  I used the soup in a recipe as a substitute for a can of celery soup, but it would also be tasty on its own.

We made this recipe as written but instead of straining out the veggies, we pureed them, and it was still a bit bland. It had great potential and I will use this again as solid base. After the soup was finished, we doctored it up with powdered onion, granulated garlic, more white pepper, celery salt, and paprika.

So yummy, I did the following to adapt, I used the whole organic carrots greens and all.  I did not strain the veggies I used an immersion blender to pulverize the veggies.  I used butter instead of margarine and I used less.  Oh and, I added just a bit f red pepper flake. Yummy! 

 (Wish  there was a way to keep notes in with our recipes)

I did what islandgirl05 said, immersion blended all veges.  I only made 1/3 of the recipe.  I added three cloves of garlic and used real butter instead of margarine.  Extremely good flavor.  I would love to know if it did well in the freezer.

Just made this soup tonight, as I had extra celery and carrots in the house.  I cut the measurements down from a 32-serving recipe to an 8-serving recipe.  Here are my measurements:  3 cups, 24 ounces, of chicken stock; 1-1/2 cups, 12 ounces, celery finely chopped; 1/4 cup, 2 ounces, carrot finally chopped; 1/4 cup onions, finely chopped; 1/4 cup flour; 3/4 teaspoon salt; 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper; 3 cups hot milk; 1/4 cup margarine or butter.  Some notes: 2 cans of chicken broth equals about 29 ounces so I used two cans and then added some additional celery, carrots, and onions.  I also used 1/2 cup of flour to make the soup a little thicker.  I also did not discard the vegetables, as I had finally chopped them, then puréed the soup a bit once cooked.  Turned out really yummy.

I really liked this recipe.  Like someone else, I couldn't throw out all those veggies so I blended them into the soup.  Have made this three times and have it already among my favorite recipes.  Thanks so much.  I'll never purchase again.  This is going to be my go to.  :-)

I made 1/3 amount and was very disappointed with results.  Had no celery flavor.  It was very thick and had a floury taste.   Will not make again.

I used a hand blender to puree the veggies and vegetable bullion in place of chicken.  Still we felt it could have been a little thicker.

I made 8 servings (which was 3 lunch servings for me, since I ate just the soup for lunch). I followed the recipe with the differences pointed out by WONDERFALK (the author), which involved discarding half the celery and blending the remainder of the celery and veggies after boiling for 10 min. I also used butter since I didn't have margarine, but that's hardly worth noting. It's definitely a warm and comforting meal and stands on its own.

Tried it and added red and yellow peppers (just because I had them in the fridge) and also added more pepper. After the veggies softened I put them in the blender to puree. The soup is great.

Really good recipe!  I had lots of celery in my fridge because a previous recipe only required two stalks.  I normally don't like celery too much, but this soup is delicious!  I changed the servings to 5 because 32 is way too much. I used a whole carton of chicken stock, and instead of milk, I used a can of evaporated milk.  I also added in more celery than required by the recipe (I needed to use up the celery!) and I also omitted the margarine.  Once the vegetables were cooked down (about 25 min), then I used my immersion blender.  Then added in the evaporated milk mixture :)

Just left the dinner table - yum, yum, yum!I followed recipe pretty much, but took advice from other reviewers and made these changes: added garlic and a pinch of nutmeg, did not strain the veggies, just pureed them in my Cuisinart (the immersion blender others suggested just did not make it smooth enough for my taste). Also, because there are only two of us here, I took the advice of others and omitted the roux so I can freeze 2 cup portions and add the roux (2 T. butter. 2 T. flour and 2 cups milk) when I thaw and heat it. Thanks for the very tasty soup, and because my husband is on a sodium restricted diet, I can make it and use it in all those wonderful, easy casseroles that I used to make with Campbells Cream of Celery Soup, but without the high sodium count.

This is amazing!!!!....however....I totally agree with a previous comment....don't strain the veggies.....either purée them fully into the soup....or what I did was half purée it....so there were still some chunks.....I used butter instead of margarine.....butter is way better for flavour ( and healthier..   :). ).   Also threw in some garlic....LOVE it!!!!!!!

I just wanted to guzzle this soup from a tall glass - that's how good it is!  I only had dry milk on hand so I used that with the called for amount of warm water and whisked together with the flour. I also used butter.  I boiled the soup for about 10 minutes and then decided to add in garlic and cilantro.  I also added more white pepper and cooked it for another 10 minutes. Then, pureed it in the blender and served it with a dusting of Hungarian paprika. Fab!

Really good flavor, easy to make! Need to cut the celery smaller or definitely strain - celery strings are chewy even if using stick to blend. I like  to leave veggies in whenever possible. This soup may not be one of those.

I Love this soup. I puree it and freeze in one cup portions so that I can take it in my bagged lunches. Delicious hot or cold and perfect for eating on the run!

i dont like giving anything less than 4 stars for recipes unless i really feel it's barely okay.. i'm hoping the reason i feel this way is because i had to use soy milk instead of regular milk.. i pureed the vegetables into the soup but it still tasted a little bland to me

I left the vegetables in and pureed them in the blender.  I also used water and chicken bouillon instead of broth.  Very cheap, simple recipe with lots of flavor.

I would have given this recipe 5 stars but it just lacked some flavor, probably due to the fact that I didn't have carrots.  I was using leftover celery from Superbowl, didn't know what to do with it, and I found this recipe.  I did use my immersion (sp?) blender and pureed the celery and onions after adding the chicken broth and Almond Milk. I threw in a little half and half for richness too.  What made it fun was I had some finishing salts that I put on the table and we had fun tasting the soup with the different salts.  Pink Australian salt was the winner :) Everyone enjoyed it, despite missing the carrots tho!

Used skim milk and a little heavy cream, really good, make sure to keep,stirring or it will stick to the bottom. Did use the immersion blender, I would have liked it a bit chunkier, maybe less liquids

Mmmmm... This is delicious, I am now just finishing my second bowl :-)
I don't have a food processor or a mixer (I'm very young and just starting to live on my own, but been cooking since I was a kid)

I am sure it would have been even better if I had it... I just cut the vegetables reallly tiny, but it's great :) thanks!

I started by cutting this recipe in half, as it's huge if you don't. Then I replaced one cup of milk with a cup of cream to thicken it up a bit, and replaced the chicken stock with vegetable broth to make it vegetarian. Like others, I hand blended the vegetables right in the soup instead of removing them. I thought the soup was good, but it didn't really get thick-thick. Also, I wasn't sure of the weight of celery, but for the recipe cut in half I used one full "head" of celery.

This was a good soup.  The flavor was just a smidge off - but it should be easy to fix next time.
