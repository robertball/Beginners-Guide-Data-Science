Made as written and I really liked this but it is definitely not a chili. As written, it is a very soupy soup. The  cauliflower breaks down so if you stir it quite a bit after it is finished, it does help "thicken" but if you want a chili like consistency I recommend reducing the broth to 2 cups. I had never used Quorn prior to this recipe and while not a vegetarian, I really enjoyed the product. This soup was simple to make and had great flavor. I prefer soup consistency over chili but even I will cut down on the broth next time.
