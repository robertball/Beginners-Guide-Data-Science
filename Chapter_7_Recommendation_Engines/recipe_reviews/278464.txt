The cloves were overpowering and this tastes nothing like chipotle. I recommend to not wast your time and to find a different recipe.

I always eat barbacoa at chipotle.  This is not that.  It is good, but not copycat chipotle barbacoa.   I found a different recipe to try next time.

Great flavor and spice is easy to adjust if you like it hotter or a little more mild. We used it to make tacos, which we topped off with fresh cilantro. Will definitely make again!

This was good, but the flavor of clove and cumin was a bit overpowering. I might try it again with less of those ingredients and see if we like it better.

Yum! I made it low-FODMAP with garlic oil and the green parts of green onions and it was fab on nachos!

I thought this was excellent and so did my hubby. I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch. I couldn't find dried Chipotles, so substituted with Pasilla Chilies. I also used 3/4 tsp ground cloves because I didn't have any whole cloves. This was a fun and delicious meal! Thank you!

We live in Hawaii where there are no Chipotle restaurants. We had been craving this recipe and weren’t disappointed. Because of Covid 19 I was unable to find dried chipotle peppers. I did have chipotle powder which worked just fine. I used 1-1/2 t. and achieved a nice level of spice without overpowering the flavor. I would definitely make this again.
