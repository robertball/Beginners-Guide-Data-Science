I made this recipe because it was the only hubbard squash recipe listed, and I had obtained one randomly. 

This tastes like a pumpkin pie, if I had to compare it to something. Very tasty!

I used 1tsp of cinnamon and .5tsp nutmeg for the apple pie spice. I also used evaporated milk instead of cream, and it turned out fine. Mashing the squash was good enough, I avoid pureeing whenever possible.

Nice to see good squash recipes listed. Thanks!

As most of the reviewers for this one I came about a hubbard squash by inheritance. This is somewhat like a pumpkin pie but its darker and the taste is a bit different. Its not real sweet but sweet enough to be enjoyable. We really liked it. Under the circumstances I inherit another one of the squashes this is the first thing I will make with it.

This is almost exactly like my mom's recipe. She has been making it for years (me, only two but I still think of it as mine). I love this pie. I spice it just like pumpkin pie, and no one can tell the difference until I tell them. We call it pumpkin pie, and this is the only version we make at thanksgiving! I use condensed milk instead of cream, and white sugar instead of brown.  It's creamier than pumpkin, which makes it better :)

Someone gave me  a hubbard squash from their  garden. I was told it made delicious pies. So I was thrilled when I found this recipe. The first time I made the pies. I followed the recipe as stated. Not being very much into sweets myself I was happy with the  low sugar content of the pies so I knew they'd be fine for anyone on a low sugar diet (ie grandma).  However I am in the South and "WE LOVE OUR SWEETS" so the second time I made them for the "not so low sugar crowd" I put in 2 cups of dark brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar. What a crowd pleaser! Great recipe it's really a 2 in 1 recipe!  Thanks

I'm giving this recipe five stars because the reservations I describe are not its fault.  This is the first pie I've made from a "raw" squash, always having used canned pumpkin before.  I was happy with the result.  Flavor and texture were fine (although the pies cracked -- like a cheescake.  My "reservations" are simply that the resulting pie is really no better than with the canned stuff!  Roasting the squash and extracting the pulp was not all that difficult -- but not as easy as opening a can, for the same results!  One change I did make was to substitute a mix of pumpkin-pie spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and ginger) for the called-for apple-pie spice.  Although I suspect that apple-pie spice and pumpkin-pie spice are similar, I just could not bring myself to use apple-pie spcies in what is essentially pumpkin pie.  I don't recall any reviewers commenting on the spice -- maybe the comments are there (just didnt see 'em).  I do wonder if the apple-pie spice would somehow have worked with the hubbard squash in some special way.....

A very lightly sweet, dense, nicely flavored pie.  I used evaporated milk to reduce fat and topped it with a sugar free whipped topping.  My husband, who isn't a fan of squash and tried it almost reluctantly, really liked it!

LOVED this pie!! This will be my ultimate go-to "pumpkin" pie recipe from now on. The flavor and smooth texture was amazing! 

I had some buttercup squash that I had previously roasted, mashed, and frozen. Just grabbed a 2 cup bag of squash (thawed, of course), and tossed it in the blender with the rest of the ingredients, just as listed.

Buttercup squash is a bit drier and finer textured than regular ol' pumpkin, so this pie had a wonderful smooth texture. Also, buttercup squash is sweeter than most other winter squashes and pumpkins, so I stuck with the 1/2 cup sugar and it was just perfect. Anything more would have been too sweet. 

The apple pie spice was great in this pie, rather mild and to me it really fits the late summer/early fall season. When I make this pie around Thanksgiving and Christmas, I'll probably use pumpkin pie spice.

I was having a meeting with co-workers so I made this the nite before and brought it in for our meeting and it was the rave about. My family also loved it. My husband wants to use this instead of our pumpkin pie receipe we usually use. It has now become one of our family fav's. thanks for the recipe.

Excellent pie.  I topped the pie with topping mix and instructions from Brown Family's favorite Pumpkin Pie.  Nobody knew it wasn't really pumpkin pie.  Very creamy, very tasty.  Will always use this recipe in future when I want pumpkin pie.  Oh, and I used Pumpkin Pie Spice rather than apple pie spice.

I wanted a lighter tasting pie, so I used light brown sugar instead of dark. This worked great. I had a huge Blue Hubbard to use so I made a 2 pie batch for Thanksgiving. I also made a very standard pumpkin pie. People came back for seconds on the Blue Hubbard pie and both both Blue Hubbard pies were quickly gone and the pumpkin pie was barely touched.

I used evaporated milk instead of cream, and butternut squash instead of hubbard in my blender and it was quite a hit! I will definitely make this again, it turned out perfectly :-D

Yummy. Made it just like the recipe, but also made my own crust. First time making a pie for me, and it was a success.

I followed the recipe exactly as written except I made my own pie crust and used nutmeg and cinnamon for apple pie mix.  This recipe is excellent.   I hope my neighbor gives me another Hubbard next year if I can't figure out a place to grow my own.  Loved it.

Really delicious!  Everyone thought it was better than pumpkin pie.  I think it kind of hurt my husband's feelings because he is the one who makes the pumpkin pie every year.  (I don't even like pumpkin pie..:)

It was ok, tasted a lot like pumpkin. The kids tasted it but wouldn't take more than one bite, and they love pumpkin pie. I thought it wasn't quite sweet enough, next time I would up the sugar to 1 cup.

Easy to do...what sped it up was that I already had some leftover hubbard squash baked the day before. So prep time was much shorter for me.  The pie turned out delicious. Taste is not like pumpkin or sweet potato pie. Definitely has a unique taste all its own. The custard was very light. Loved that the pie was not sweet. - yodolher

This is the best "pumpkin" pie I've ever had. I've used various combinations of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and allspice in lieu of apple pie (or pumpkin pie) spice, and I use whipping cream for "heavy" cream--I put half of a 500 mL container in it and whip the other half to put on top. Note that this recipe actually makes two 9-inch standard-sized pies.

This pie was fabulous.  I got lots of compliments.  Everybody told me there was no point in using a fresh squash instead of canned - that it all tasted the same.  This pie changed their minds!

The pie came out excellent.. I used a scant 2 cups of the Blue Hubbard pumpkin( squash) because I bought a giant one , roasted it whole for 2 hours( was about 10 lbs) .. and puréed all and bagged and froze all in 2 cup portions leaving the last portion a couple tablespoons shy of 2 cups..Only changes I made were that I used pumpkin pie spice. Will of course make again and use the purée in bread and soup recipes..

This is an excellent replacement for traditional pumpkin pie. As a matter of fact, I would never make another pumpkin pie after eating this. Everyone loved it and none was left.  The only change I made was to add an additional 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar and 3/4 cup of chopped pecans. Delicious!

1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2cup of heavy cream are both obviously wrong.  Even with 2 and 1/2 cups of evaporated milk this won't make custard. And I think it was meant to be 1 AND 1/2 cups of brown sugar.
