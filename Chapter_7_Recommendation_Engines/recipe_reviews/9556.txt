Change the name!  I lost my tried & true fudge recipe, so I thought I'd try this one.  The fudge never set up. I  put it in the fridge & it hardened, but as soon as it comes to room temp, it's too gooey--5 lbs of chocolate sauce!

This probably shouldn't go by "NO FAIL" fudge... After 3 failures I think I finally figured it out (my husband decided to be nice and buy me all the ingredients I'd need for all my Christmas fudge, so I had to keep trying it). While boiling, I put all other ingredients into one bowl (with marshmallow creme on top to avoid it just sticking to the bowl) and at the end of five minutes, I dumped in the last ingredients quickly and THEN took it off the stove. If the fudge gets too hot (stirring while still on the stove) or isn't hot enough (taking it off stove then adding last ingredients) it won't set up right. Today it turned out perfectly and set up wonderfully. It does have a good taste to it whether it sets up or not, but let's face it, nobody reading this recipe was looking for fudge sauce!

I used this recipe 3 times successfully (it was on the back of the Kraft Marshmallow Creme jar) and then I think they changed the composition of the Creme. I made it and it turned out all gooey. I noticed that they put a new fudge recipe on the back of the jar but wanted to try it the old way anyway-bad idea. :(

I read reviews and I think some people didn't have success cuz it is the recipe from the back of Kraft marshmellow creme jar and they did change `the composition. I do it the original way, that is with a bag of chocolate chips. I liked this cuz it was so easy. I don't have a candy thermonotor and was glad I didn't have to use one here. Just make sure you keep stirring and don't let it burn. I think everyone's problem is the recipe change (not using chocolate chips). Maybe we should write Kraft and complain and they would put the old recipe back. Good idea, I'm going to write them right now. :)  The stars are for the old recipe. I JUST GOT BACK FROM THE KRAFT SITE AND if anyone would like, they have the old recipe, look up Fantasy Fudge, on the same page, they list the old recipe calling it Classic Fantasy Fudge. Good Luck

This fudge never hardened.  It was a total disaster.  I ended up throwing it away after 2 days in the refrig.  If I did something wrong I'd like to know.  I followed the recipe exactly.

Major Disaster!!  I followed this recipe exactly as was written and it never hardened!  I ended up with two batches of mush.  It was an expensive waste of time.

This was the first time I made fudge and it turned out well.  It had more of a marshmallow flavor than what I was going for.  I used Hershey milk chocolate bars.  The next time I will try it with Hershey Special Dark chocolate bars.

This is the best Fudge recipe!!!!!!!!  I have tried to make fudge many times and it always comes out dry and breaks apart.  This fudge stays moist and is very very good.  Everyone loved the fudge and asked for more.

My friends and I made this in our annual Christmas bake.  We were successful. However, I was not crazy about the flavour. Would add more nuts if there were to be a next time. But I think I will go on the search for another fudge recipe. This one didn't do it for me.

This recipe was good. My first time making fudge. I followed some of the advice on the other reviews. BUT, when combining the ingredients i had the chips and marshmallow fluff in one bowl and the sugar milk mix on the stove. after boiling for 5 mins i layered all the ing. in a bigger bowl. starting with the hot mix then some chips, then hot mix, then chips! I stirred till it was no longer lumpy with a whisk and then poured immediatly into pan lined with wax paper! i let it cool in the coldest room in my house and it was already setting in the first 20 mins. I plan to keep it in the cold room for the next 24 hours to ripen! then refrigerate.

More marshmallow taste then I cared for. The fudge set up softer then expected but still good, this did come out a little greasy I think I used to much cooking spray. I would try this again, but this time I will add chocolate and marshmallow cream at one time.

Great recipe. I find if a fudge won't set up that it is usually that I didn't let it heat long enough at the right temp. I can't believe some people threw this out for not setting up. It also would make wonderful ice cream topping ;)

I see a lot of people complaining about the consistancy of this fudge.  After sitting here and thinking about it, since it came out perfect my first try, I'm going to surmise that one of several things may have happened.

1.  Check to make sure you are measuring accurately.  For example, the marshmallow cream should be 3 cups.  That's more than one small jar.  Also one can of evaporated milk is 12 ounces and this recipe calls for only 10.  Adding extra milk would make it runnier.

2.  Omit the water.  It's really not needed unless you want the surface of your fudge to be shiny.

3.  Make sure to bring the milk and sugar mixture to a rolling boil for 5 solid minutes.  Candy making is a very detailed experience.  Keep an eye and make sure it's a rolling boil and do not go less than 5 minutes.

4.  Exchange the vanilla chips for chocolate ones.  Vanilla and flavored chips have a different consistancy than good old fashioned chocolate ones.  I used Nestle dark chocolate chips in their all natural line.

5.  For an extra kick, add a splash of vanilla right after stirring in the marshamllow creme and the chips.  Trust me, it'll make all the difference in the world.
