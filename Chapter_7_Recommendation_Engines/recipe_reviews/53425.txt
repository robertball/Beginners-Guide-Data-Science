I wasn't too thrilled with this recipe.  It really just tasted like an inexpensive pizza (almost like frozen).  I even tried using fresh mozzarella and well it just wasn't something I think we will make again.  Thanks anyway for the post.

This is truly a good, quick and easy recipe. They make great appetizers and of course, the kids will devour them. You can be as creative as you want with this. Try some ham with mozarella cheese but leave out the sauce. If you want to be a little daring, you can even deep fry these babies. Not nearly as healthy, but yummy too!

Great recipe when you have very little time - I can whip these up quickly and the kids can eat them on the run.  You do have to be careful not to over-fill or they're difficult to seal shut, but it's a good quick meal.  Thanks.

This recipe does not work as written. The pastry doesn't bake completely in ten minutes, leaving the texture very gummy. It is also hard to work with when stuffing/sealing the calzones, and doesn't taste very good with the pizza ingredients. All in all it was not worth the aggravation, even the kids would not eat it. Sorry.

These turned out to be very yummy!  I baked them an extra 4-5 minutes and probably could have cooked them even a bit longer.  I added mushrooms and next time will add sausage as well.  My husband LOVED them- definitely will make again!

These were very good and went over very well especially with the kids. A little messy to make but that's half the fun.

Very delicious! My family loved it! My hubby wants me to make more tonight! I did have a problem there being too much filling. No because I didn't like the amount but because the amount called for overflowed onto my pan. Otherwise GREAT!

Kids loved it and it was very easy - but it's hard not to compare with my favorite Calzones at a local restaurant.

This was fast and pretty good, but the logistics were off as far as preparations go, and this is clearly not anything like an authentic calzone. We used one can of crescent rolls to make 2 calzones. We filled them with veggies and cheese, and had a hard time sealing them. I thought they would be oozing out all over the baking sheet, but they actually didn't. We also made our own pizza sauce instead of using the sauce in the recipe. I would make these again if I had the ingredients on hand, and needed something quick, but not as a means to fill a craving for a calzone.

Although this was easy and convenient, it was nowhere near as good as proper calzones - the crescent roll dough is just too sweet and crumbly. Thanks anyway.

These were so good! The kids devoured them! I did alter the recipe though. Here is what I did:

1. Line baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. Roll over the crescent rolls a bit to flatten them out. 
3. Do not put sauce inside. I used jarred pizza sauce to dip them in when done.
4. Bake 10 minutes, then flip them over and bake for 5 more. The came out golden brown all over!

i thought this recipe was great. it was quick, easy, and absolutely tasty. i loved the sweetness that the crescent rolls gave to the dish. i wasn't able to do the rectangle part of the directions, due to a spontaneous dough explosion on the drive home. however, it was easy enough to reshape the dough and go from there. i will definitely be making these again!
