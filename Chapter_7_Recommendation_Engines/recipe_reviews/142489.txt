I hate to rate my own recipe, but I felt I needed to post some extra info about this burger for people.  I cannot stress enough how important it is to properly form your patties.  All the air MUST be out which takes a little time, otherwise they will fall apart.  I never have any problems with them falling apart, but I cook a lot of burgers.    I also would just like to repeat that the BBQ sauce used in this recipe is very thick.  Thick BBQ sauce is a must.

The name suits it right, but OMGosh.. its so good.  I did have to make one change which will just put this over the "top" next time.  I did not realize that we had no bacon.  I used real bacon bits and just added it to the burger mix.  I used Dave's BBQ Sauce from this site because I was out too.  I dont have a grill, I did these in my "iron skillet".  I also put the slice of pineapple in the skillet just to heat and warm, that was the only thing I did not think would be good was the cold pineapple on the burger.  You want to crip your bun.  I used homemade hamburger buns from this site too.. When you make these the meal is "all about the BURGER"... Thank you for the recipe.. great job.

DELICIOUS!!!! First I halved the recipe. Okay, now I am very familiar with what I like, so when preparing the meat I added a little Adobo and garlic powder. I didn't have hawaiian barbecue sauce, so I used original jack daniels bbq sauce mixed with some pineapple juice from the canned pineapple slices (I used the directed amount in the burger and set some aside for the buns). We use microwavable bacon, so I cooked the burgers with the bacon in the pan next to the burgers then topped the burgers with the bacon and cheese. These burgers have it all, the juiciness, crunchiness, sweet and salty, a great burger and a must try!

Loved these! I only used two pounds on ground beef and they were still huge! I had no problem with them falling apart. We used Sweet Baby Rays Sweet and Spicy bbq sauce. I did add some extra sauce to the burger! Yum

We LOVED these! I made them exactly as written except for just cooking the bacon seperately and putting it on the burger after (I never have good luck w/ wrapping the bacon around, lol). I had no trouble with them falling apart or anything. I served them on toasted Hawaiin Burger Buns. This recipe is a definate keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

These are so tasty! The first time we made them we forgot to mix in the cheese- still great! Any pieces that fell off were shoved right back on the bun! IT'S a burger! Messy and delicious. The second time we used a grill basket and just turned then all together on the grill. No problem at all. Nobody wants us to come to the BBQ unless we bring these with us. I have shared this recipe many times. People think your recipe is the tops!

Update 8- 2017//  Kids still ask for these when they visit home. I throw together the mix (sometimes freeze it-so i just pull out a bag), patty them and refrigerate. Ready to cook when we are. I do them on the stove(year round), bacon in same pan(gets sticky and tasty from bbq). Drain any grease at end and throw in pineapple slices. OMGoodness, they are Awesome!!! Blue cheese has made an appearance on top w pineapple mmm.  
-----Original (1-2011) These were excellent-YUMMY!!! I did not refrigerate- no time. I did not grill the bun or pineapple. I actually put the burgers on a broiler pan in oven for about 10 minutes on each side. This was a last minute throw together but worked GREAT. EVERYONE loved them. I will plan to create exactly next time just to see if they can get any better.

I wish zero stars was an option!  They looked and smelled awesome until they hit the grill, at which point they fell right through it! I changed absolutely nothing in the recipe - I followed it to the T!

I like the general idea of this burger, but we changed a few things... first, I halved the reciped and used ground turkey instead of beef. Also, i ommitted the monterrey jack and bbq sauce and instead used teryaki sauce. Then, instead of french fried onions, we used grilled onions. They were delicious!!!! We loved the way the pineapple tasted with the bacon and teryaki... it was a hit in our house.

These had a nice taste, but they wouldn't stick together.  My husband tried to cook them on the grill like the recipe said, but when he tried to flip the first one it fell apart.  He ended up bringing them in and I finished cooking them on the stove, but they still were pretty hard to flip and get on the buns without them falling to pieces.

First of all, forget healthy.  Second, it's kind of expensive to make.  Third, it's well worth it if you don't feel too guilty the next day!!

I gave this recipe three stars just because the basic idea is great but mixing the bbq sauce in and not adding a little panko crumbs guarantees that the burgers will fall apart. This is the way we do it; put the meat in a bowl and add about 1/4 cup of chopped onion, about 1/2 cup bbq sauce, and some panko crumbs and lightly mix until the meat and additions are fully mixed together. Do not handle the meat roughly; use just your fingers and don't squeeze the ingredients too much, that makes a compact, tough burger.  Use sliced fresh pineapple, peel, slice, grill, and then remove the core with a small paring knife, also use Kings Hawaiian sandwich rolls if you can find them. We also make a wasabi/honey mayo to go on the burgers. The honey helps with the bitterness of the wasabi powder that we mix into the mayo.

I really liked these and I wish I could give more stars. But, while these burgers were tasty, I do not think they were worth the time and cost. First of all, they did not stay together well at all. Second, it cost a fortune for all the ingredients. Third, I halved the recipe, and I got seven burgers and the original yield of the recipe is eight, and they were HUGE! We were eating them for three days (they cost to much not to finish them). And while I enjoyed them, they were really heavy and not something I would want to eat every day. Not reccomended.

These are really good! I dont have a grill so I broiled mine. They fell apart a bit, but not too bad. Im sure they'd be even better grilled! Definitely a keeper! Yum!
