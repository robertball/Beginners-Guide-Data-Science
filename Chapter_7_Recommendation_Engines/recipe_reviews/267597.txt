My super picky child adores these cookies. They are great as a snack and make a wonderful treat. The flavor is best after they have completely cooled. The texture is softer and almost creamy, personally I love that about these cookies.  The recipe calls for 1/2 cup of the Carnation Breakfast Essentials, it's about 1  1/2 packets.  The only change I made was that I used nonstick cooking foil and no cooking spray. My peanut butter is simply dry roasted nuts and no other ingredients.  We love these cookies so much that I have already several times.

The grandkids loved this recipe and I loved that they were getting something healthy. The texture is different from that of a regular cookie, but it was obviously perfect for them. Let them cool before storing in fridge.

Ok so I was not in love with these cookies. Although the flavor was ok the texture really turned me off. Then I went back to Re read the recipe and realized in the description it mentions oats.... but, there was no oats in the ingredients or in the directions. Maybe there was a mistake in the recipe because I feel if there were suppose to be oats added then it would make some sense as to why the texture was so off.
