I wanted a blue cocktail to toast the birth of my new grandson. This one was not only the appropriate color, it was tasty too. I used sweet & sour mix & I rimmed my glass w/ blue sugar although I wish I had dyed kosher salt instead. Thanks Isaac!

I brought this recipe to my local tavern to "test drive" before I bought the ingredients.  It was a huge hit! Everyone in the bar loved the alcohol combination and the owner even added it to his cocktail list.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Loved the color! Can see making this for a tropical party. Very refreshing on a hot day. It was a little too tart for my husband and me but we drank it down nevertheless.

We were looking for a festive cocktail at home for New Year's Eve when I came across this drink recipe. My husband loves margaritas so I thought this would be a fun twist on his favorite cocktail. And boy did he love it as do I. Super easy to make & looks amazing in a martini glass with a slice of lime. This is now how we make margaritas all the time. It has a great taste to it.

OMG!! A little bit sour, a little bit sweet, a little bit coconuty.  And a fun blue color.  It's the perfect change up from your regular margarita if you want something more than your basic lime flavor.  Wonderful!  This one definitely went into my Recipe Box!

This is the BEST Blue Margarita recipe.  Nothing else like it.  I put in 2 oz of tequila instead of 1 1/4.  but other than that we love this.  5 stars for sure.

I adjusted the serving to 4. That amount made a good half pitcher. Margaritas are my favorite and this did not disappoint! Thanks for the recipe!
