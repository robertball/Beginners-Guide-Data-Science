This was fun to make and my husband said they were tasty.  One suggestion, line an old shoe box with tin foil and poke air holes in the top.  Then, add some chocolate sprinkles to the floor of the box.  Serve the mice in the box and it will look like they've been living there for awhile:).

Give yourself plenty of time to make these as you will want to make more than one batch.I used a cookie scoop to size the dough and shaped a couple at a time keeping the rest in the refrig. to stay cold and firm. Made tails out of caramels as suggested by others with great results. A small knife to pierce the dough for the placement of ears, tail and eyes made assembly easy. Used pink pearl candies for eyes. Mice can be made a couple days ahead and kept in the fridge but caramel tails will get soft so do not add until day of the party. Tails can be made ahead as well but store alone. These are well worth the effort. For those unfamiliar with chocolate wafers Nabisco (R) makes Famous Chocolate Wafers. They come in a 9 oz yellow box with a cellophane wrapper. UPDATE 3/12/07 Check-out Peanut Butter Christmas Mice by Paula, also very cute!

We just won a prize at an adult Halloween party for these. We made a lab rat maze out of a computer paper box lid and strips of cardboard covered with foil--scotch tape held the strips in to make the maze walls (took about 10 minutes to make). We dripped fake blood on a note next the maze saying that these mice are for the taking and the the hammer (propped up against the maze) is the most effective way of killing them so you can eat them, unless you want to bite their heads off. We dressed as mad scientists. Recipe modification: instead of using licorice, make VERY realistic tails by rolling pieces of caramel into skinny tapering strips. Most of the comments we got at the party were about the caramel tails!

I have no clue what chocolate wafer cookies are, so I used oreos (cream and all, crushed them in food processor until very fine). I used the crushed oreos again to roll them on. For brown mice i rolled them in baking cocoa powder. I did try the confectioner's sugar for white mice but they didn't look right at all because the "background" is too dark. I made 4 tails out of one caramel candy by cutting in quarters and heating them in microwave for a few seconds. I attached the tails before rolling the chocolate bodies in the cookies/cocoa. I had to shove some of the tail inside the body so they would stay attached. I made 18 mice out of this recipe**Update**Made them again and they were much easier the second time around. Try not to handle the "dough" too much, the heat of your hands will melt them and make them harder to handle. I used crushed teddy grahams for tan/beige colored mice.

omg, these were so cute! they turned out well, tho i had the same problem with the powdered sugar as another writer. couldn't decide if i put on too much and should have just barely rolled them so it absorbed into their little bodies, or if i didn't put on enough; i should have poured it on to make them look furry. any recs on this end would be appreciated. the crushed oreo ones turned out the best. and caramel tails - what a brilliant idea! couldn't find the silver bullet things for eyes, so just bought some red, white and blue sprinkles and used the red or white ones for eyes. my fiance lost his guy card by adding little pink barbie sprinkles hearts (upside down) for noses. and if you're like me - not the sharpest knife in the drawer - you'll want to put the coconut in the food processor BEFORE rolling the mice in it - elsewise, you'll end up with shaggy DA mice. (they didn't look the best, but i thought they tasted the best; nice counterbalance to the strong chocolate taste). anyway, awesome! thanks for another great halloween idea. (kitty litter cake is another winner.)

These mice turned out so cute! I took them to a Halloween party at church and got so many compliments. They were yummy too. I modified the recipe a little. I used cream cheese instead of sour cream. I made one batch with semisweet chocolate chips and covered them in crushed oreos. Then I made another batch with white chocolate chips and covered them with powdered sugar. I used rolled caramels for the tails, as others had suggested. I used candy sprinkles for the eyes and little dots of pink frosting for noses. They weren't hard to make, but then did get my hands very messy. I will definately make them again!

These are so cute, so easy, so yummy!!  Everyone was shocked to find out it wasn't fudge!!  I used chocolate teddy grahams, and they worked perfect.  Will Make again!!  I also put my mice in a box with foil and added chocolate sprinkles. (they looked just like mouse droppings!)  Everyone got a good laugh about these little critters.

My kids and I had a blast making these adorable and yummy treats.  They were the hit of a Halloween party we attended.  We put them on a tray covered with coconut that had been dyed with yellow food coloring (like straw) and sprinkled small chocolate sprinkles around them (like droppings!)  Very realistic.

This is just the cutest Halloween treat!  Yes, it is time consuming, but I go for the "WOW" effect and this is it!  I used Tootsie rolls for the tails, just micro them 10 seconds on high, slice in half, and then roll each half into a pointy tail.  I used red jimmies for the eyes.  I put the tail, eyes and ears on before covering with half Oreo cookie crumbs and half graham cracker crumbs.  I put them in a shallow pan lined with graham cracker crumbs and sprinkled with chocolate jimmies.  I can't wait to take them to work tomorrow~thanks for a keeper.  And yes, this goes nicely with the kitty litter cake on this site.

Oh, yeah, these are cute and will pass the YUK! factor in my daughter's 3rd grade class Halloween party tomorrow. I changed a little bit. For the Chocolate wafer cookies, since the store was out of chocolate, I had to buy a variety pack with Choc, Vanilla and Strawberry. For the chocolate cookies, I used Chocolate Teddy Grahams. For the tails I used those caramel sheets...I cut them in thin strips with a pizza cutter and rolled them to mahe them round instead of flat.

I didn't like pure powdered sugar, but a combo of the Teddy Grahams and sugar worked.

I used red frosting for the eveys...mostly because I couldn't find the little balls at the time.

I packed them in a small styrofoam cooler and labeled it "CAUTION LAB MICE"

I made 4 batches of these for my daughters Halloween party this year. Here are my suggestions: First, if your batter becomes to soft or chocolatey just add more cookie crumbs. Make sure you work fast. If not, keep putting it in the fridge to stay firm. I had a hard time finding something for the eyes. So, what I did was took the Confetti Candy Decorations and picked out the red ones for eyes (make sure you put the eyes on the side of the head not together..it looks better that way) For the tails, I used the Carmel Apple Sheets and just rolled them up and pulled them straight. I rolled most of mine in powder sugar. The cocoa doesnt taste good..maybe, I should try hot cocoa next time for brown ones. Anyways, this is where it got fun. I took a disposable pan and dyed coconut yellow for the hay-Choc. sprinkles for poop. Then, took a pie pumpkin and carved different sized holes into it. Placing some mice in the open holes.Then, I placed the rest of the mice around the pumpkin.  Also, another great idea I had..I used baked pumpkin seed cut in half for the ears..instead of the almonds..due to the nut issue at school. Check out my picture to get the idea.

These turned out really cute!  They disappeared within minutes at our Halloween party, but I was a little too creeped out to eat them personally!  Based on other reviewers' advice, here is what I decided. Made 2 batches.  Brown Mice:  I used dark chocolate and chocolate teddy graham crumbs, and White Mice:  I used white chocolate and nilla wafer crumbs - rolled in coconut that I ran through the food processor then powdered sugar. Decorated all mice with large sprinkles for the eyes (white on the brown mice, red on the white mice), upside down pink heart noses, sliced almond ears, and Werther's chewy caramels for the tails (1 caramel = 4 tails - microwaved individually for about 5 seconds to soften then cut in half lengthwise and pulled the caramel to stretch it).  Each batch made 12 mice.  Put on a Jelly Roll pan covered in yellow shredded coconut with a small carved pumpkin in the middle. These didn't take nearly as long as I feared they would based on reading reviews - surprisingly easy and fun to make!

Made these for my sons grade 6 christmas party. Easy, yummy, adorable and fun. Every kid and a bunch of the staff at the school has asked for the recipie. Served on a platter mixed with the Cake Ball recipie from this site. Fantastic. Mini white chocolate chips are a great "ear" option for a nut free environment.

I made these for my daughters Halloweeen party at school and they were a hugh hit!! I received a phone call from her teacher the other day and it seems that the class voted that they would like mouse cookies for their Valentines Day party!!
I could not find crushed chocolate wafer cookies so I ground Oreo's filling and all. These are very easy and give a big look without a lot of time.

My sister and I made 4 batches of these for a Halloween party involving 116 kids. They were a bit of work, I ground oreo cookies filling and all in a mini food processor. My sister and I worked on them together. We rolled the finished mice in powdered sugar and cocoa. I did submit a photo for your viewing. I found edible black sugar pearls for the eyes,(In Omaha, Ne. at Mangelsen's) which made them look like real eyes, little and beady. Kind of creepy. The tails were difficult to find, I would prefer something easier to attach, and a bit more realistic, but have not found the right item just yet. We made them all up one day prior to the party, then put them on a round platter for pictures, then I stored them in an airtight plastic lidded container in the refrigerator because they had sour cream in them. We placed them on a very large round black platter right before the party. The kids really thought they were neat. They are work, we had trouble getting the eyes to attach, we discovered if we stuck one eye on, then held it in with our thumb, added the eye to the other side, then pushed each eye toward the other it helped to anchor them into the mice, as well as shape the nose into a more realistic shape. We also used a cookie scoop to get the dough into a ball. Quite fun!

Rosina, this is a fabulous recipe. I made these mice for my 3yr old grand-daughter and she loved them and I had fun making them. I can't wait to make them again next Halloween. Thanks. Rosie

These are adorable yet oddly spooky looking at the same time! Downside is the recipe only yields 12 and they are a little costly and time consuming to make. I thought about just using them as a decoration on another plate of food. I took another reviewers suggestion and just used tootsie rolls for the tails. Out of each tootsie roll I got 3-4 tails. I microwaved them unwrapped for 5 seconds. I just did the chocolate mice and didn't need the powdered sugar. I used Oreo cookies and removed the filling and grinded them in a blender. They only needed to refridgerate about 1-2 hours before being shaped. I had to wash and dry my hands after making each one. They were a lot like making truffles. The almonds went in easily, but I had to use a toothpick to make a hole to insert the eyes and tail. I placed them on parchment and refridgerated until needed. Kool recipe!

These were a huge hit for my Halloween gathering (with all adults, who giggled and ooh-ed and ah-ed over them). They were extremely easy to make, yet looked and tasted like it was a fancy, complex recipe. ^_^ Definitely a keeper for future events.

I also used caramel for the tails insted of licorice. I wasn't about to pay 4+ dollars for one small sleeve of chocolate wafters so I used chocolate graham crackers instead and they tasted great!  LOVED the way these came out and will definitely make them again!

My mother in law had a huge mouse in her house while my father in law was away on a trip and it was a "mouse hunt" type story. I made these mice and gave them to her in a shoe box for Christmas this year and we all had a great laugh. Everyone said they were so good. They were so eazy to make. The only thing I think you should know before making is that the mouse mix melts fast so hurry and make the mouse shapes before adding ears,eyes, and others.

These were so fun on top of my "cheese"cake. I used the caramel tails which made them look really realistic. For "cheese"cake I basically took a regulare cheescake recipe, reserved a half cup of batter, added 5 drops yellow food coloring to the main batter and poured in pan then added 15 drops to the reserved and piped in circles over the cake  so it looked like a cheese wheel. Topped with the mice and some chocolate sprinkles it looked really cool for my Halloween party!

Loved the mice, made a double batch for my daughter's sweet 16 and they were a hit.  I wavered on the hershey kisses holiday mice and these little guys, but I'm really glad I went with these.  Most of the reviews used the mice for halloween, however don't be afraid to use them for other occassions too.  They are very adaptable.  I used the small pearl candies for the eyes.  Most places don't even sell the silver drangees anymore, but the peals are so close to silver and they look very nice too.  And, I was going to use red gel for the nose, but they really didn't need it.  I used the red licorice for the tail and that really made them stand out.  Maybe for halloween I will use the caramel tails, but I love the red around the holidays.  Oh yeah, and the cookies.... I couldn't find chocolate wafers anywhere.  I was going to use chocolate teddy grams, but I decided to go with oreo cookies that have the chocolate filling.  I loved them so much, I will continue with the oreos.

These are awesome little mice :-)

I used crushed Oreo's instead of just the chocolate wafer cookies. Made the tails with caramels. I got 4 tails from each wrapped caramel square. Very easy to make, although they do take some time. I used a scoop and that gave the mice a nice flat bottom. It also made it quicker to toss in the crumbs and then just pinch the front to form the face. The Oreo's give them a good flavor. I don't think I would eat them as is since they are pretty rich. Just fun to make!! Looked very cute sitting on top of cupcakes. Would be really fun to take to a Halloween party.

I brought this to a children's Halloween party, and these little mice were the favorite treat of the night!  I'm certain that other bakers slaved over their creations... not me!  This was easy to make, fun for my children and me to prepare, tasty to eat, and fabulous to look at!  I read reviews and made caramel tails.  Try it, because what the reviewers say is true:  everyone will be most impressed with the life-life tails!

adorable! i made mine with greek yogurt instead of sour cream...worked very well. about a half a pack of the famous chocolate wafers is one recipe (if you don't use them for coating) didn't have almonds on hand so used peanuts for ears and have trouble finding drages so used white gelatin pearls for eyes...the ones i coated in powdered sugar looked splotchy and strange and made the eyes hard to stick to them so i left it off and they were great just plain...huge "awwwww" factor...everyone young and old adored them (p.s. place them individually in seasonal cupcake cups and add a few chocolate sprinkles for realistic looking mouse poo to add to the fun..tee hee)

I received so many Ooooo's, Ahhhhh's & Eeeeek's over these mice.   I presented them in a foil lined shoebox with Rice Krispies as suggested and labeled the box "Caution - Lab Mice".   My order of assembly was as follows:    After combining the chocolate, sour cream & crumbs, I divided the mixture into 24 equal portions & placed them on wax paper (I doubled the recipe).  While still soft, I shaped the mice and placed them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.   Then I refrigerated them till firm.  Forming them while still soft was a breeze.  While they firmed up, I made my tails from mini Tootsie Rolls - quarter the Rolls, microwave 10 seconds and roll into tails...kinda pointed at the end.   I also went thru the sliced almonds to match up shapes so my ears would match.  Once the mice were firm, assembly went quite quickly per the recipe.   Once all were assembled I randomly placed the mice in the shoebox, curling their tails a bit to look real.   Then I took one Tootsie Rolls quarter, rolled it very thin, cut it into  1/4" pieces, dusted the pieces with cookie crumbs, and dropped them around the mice for "droppings" - boy did they look real.   My one BIG MISTAKE... trying to transport the mice staged in their box.   During the trip the Rice Krispies shifted around quite a lot so the "droppings" disappeared into the bottom of the box and I mice where stuck together at one end of the box.  Bad news.  Had to restage at the party, but everyone loved them!

I love this recipe so much.  I hate to have to share the recipe.....I want to be the only one who makes them:}  I get countless raves about them. I used sour rasberry whips from a bulk candy store, they were kind of brown, much better than the bright red.  The humididy in Hawaii makes the white mice look grey & that makes them look more real.

My daughter works for a pest control company.  I used the idea of taking an old shoe box, lining it with tin foil and poking holes in top.  I took it to her office and told a sad tale of finding these out in the yard, not knowing what to do and assuming someone in her office could help.  She was almost afraid to open the box!  It was a great laugh and she used the same story on all the techs.  Everyone said the mice were really tasty....although my daughter had to remove the ears and tail before she could pop one in her mouth.  "They just looked too real!"

the confectioners sugar will never work since it melts into the chocolate. Alternative...use vanilla wafers. I made one batch with the regular ingredients and another with vanilla wafers and white chips. I also molded the body around a dried maraschino cherry with the stem to create a better tail.

Fun to make. I used plastic baggies on my hands so that the dough wouldn't stick and a toothpick to make the hole for the tail. 
Tastes like truffles.

Also works well using white chocolate and crushed graham crackers, then roll in graham crackers again to make light tan colored "field mice". Didn't have sliced almonds, so used half of a pink candy necklace piece for the ears for a cute replacement. Have to agree with others, caramel tails worked well and was a good complimentary flavor.

I had such fun making these mice.  I used a brownie mix to make the mice, shaped them then rolled them in ground up mini-oreo crumbs.  Piped white frosting mounds for eyes, and used carmels cut in 1/2 and rolled thin for tails.  Paired them with spider mini cupcakes and a small pumpkin on the tray.  Very cute.

These were the cutest little things, however, I thought there was too much chocolate.  I would decrease the amount of semi sweet chocolate squares I used.  Otherwise, this was a great hit at my daughters girl scout Halloween party!!!!!!!!

These mice were a hit! Everyone wanted to take a picture. I used white chocolate with vanilla cookie crumbs for the white mice, and rolled them in coconut. The brown mice were regular chocolate with chocolate cookie crumbs. I used caramel for the tails (which was a lot easier than I expected). I put the eyes on first, then rolled the mice in crumbs/coconut, then added ears. I put the tails in just before I left for the party (I used a toothpick to make holes to insert the tails), but I didn't have any problems with the caramel getting sticky so I probably could have added the tails earlier. This was a lot of work so I may never make them again, but it was fun once and the result was tasty as well as cute.

Fun to make and so yummy! Followed recipe but did use vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream which made them taste very creamy. The only bad part was my Ralph's didn't have the chocolate wafers so I had to hand scrap the filling out of every oreo cookie I used. Delivered them to my grandkids in a shoe box with oatmeal on the bottom with holes punched in the top. They had no idea what grandma had for them!

These were so simple to make.  I didn't have any frosting on hand, but i did have peanut butter!  I used that to stick the chocolate to the mini vanilla wafter and the butterscotch morsel! I found some melt away Hershey kisses that are soft and did very well with this recipe!  yummm so cute and good.  Took them to Sunday School class and shared them, they were a big hit!  Thanks for sharing!!!

This was a fun and easy recipe, although it does take some time to put the cookies together.  I followed the recipe, except I added powdered sugar to the chocolate and sour cream mixture.  I thought it was too sour without it.  I also used chocolate graham crackers instead of cookies.  Worked great and tasted good, too!

I made these for a Halloween block party. The kids and adults thought they were adorable and they brought a lot of smiles too! While they were tasty, they were very "rich" so you couldn't eat like more than one really. Very very chocolatey. There were NONE left after the block party was over and there were many yummy things to choose from at the event. Everyone wanted a chocolate mouse though! I took home an empty plate. For effect, I put the mice on a bed of sliced almonds. Made it look like the straw that goes in hamster cages.

The mice tasted pretty good... kind of a lot of work for not much to show for it. I got 16 mice out of this recipe... didn't put any eyes on them. Very messy to shape. Got compliments, but probably won't make again.

Easy but takes time. Carmel tails worked well. I did one tail ahead of time but waited on others because 1 review said that they became soft.  I think it would have been easier doing right away.  The one tail that went into the refrig overnight just hardened and it was easier to put in mice well dough was a little soft.  Used pink candy dots from AC Moore for eyes and nose. Used the whole oreo cookie and blended into crumbs. One package is enough of oreos.

This recipe was so much fun to do.  But you have to be prepared to put in the time. In order to keep the dough firm and not melting in my hands, as I was making the mice, I kept my bowl in another larger bowl half full with cruched ice.    I had to bring the mice to a party, which was a 2 hour drive.  So I put the mice in a "devil eggs" dish.  It kept the mice separate.

SO easy, and SO cute! I used chocolate graham crackers instead of cookies because as I predicted they processed beautifully in my food processor--super, super fine. My stepkids loved this project! And the mice are TASTY too! win-win

Tasty as well as fun and easy to make. The possibilities with these are endless. A creative idea for both kids and adults. I enjoyed making them and my bf enjoyed devouring them!

Super great for Halloween party. Gone instantly.  I used cream cheese instead of sour cream.  Rolled in colored coconut or cocoa.
They looked like real mice.

The reactions were priceless!  They do take time to make so plan accordingly.  I made the tails with caramel and serve them w/ brown sprinkles for droppings.  Very fun

I made these to top the "Marbled Pumpkin Cheesecake" recipe for a Halloween potluck.  It was a huge success!  Following the suggestion of another reviewer, I used caramels for the tails; each caramel square made 5 or 6 tails.  (What a great idea)!  For the eyes, I used dots of ornamental frosting:  White for the brown mice, and red for the white mice.  ***A word or caution: the eyes and tails won't stick after you cover the mice with powdered sugar or cookie crumbs.  Apply them first, or leave the bottom uncoated, so that you can attach the tails that way and wipe or scrape away enough coating for the eyese to stick!*** I also sprinkled a few chocolate sprinkles on the top of the cheesecake, for mouse droppings.  It was perfect for Halloween.  I am SO GLAD I found this recipe on this site!

These little mice were adorable! My brother (who's 25 - these aren't just for the kids!) really likes gerbils and mice, so I made these to cover a chocolate birthday cake that I made for him. I didn't have the balls for the eyes, so I used rainbow sprinkles instead. I used red sprinkles and red licorice to make albino mice rolled in conf. sugar, and white sprinkles for the other mice with black tails.  I rolled some in a cinnamon/sugar mixture for brown mice. Thanks for a great idea!!

These mice were the rave of the office staff meeting for October. I made them the night before with the help of my little granddaughter.  We rolled our mice in coconut, confectioner's sugar and chocolate cookie crumbs.  Next time I want to try the chocolate sprinkles too.  Good job Rosina!

CUTE, CUTE!!  I used this recipe to entertain girlfriends for lunch.  The menu was humorously themed, of animals found here on my ranch.  Main dish was "Crow's Nest" (a Fritos and chili dish) with "Frog Eye Salad" (acini de pepe and fruit)and of course, a tray of the Chocolate Mice for dessert.  They were easy to make and created a lot of laughter.  I'm making another batch for the holidays for my little granddaughters, to go along with the story of "The Christmas Mouse".
The chocolate mice bodies kept absorbing the powdered sugar, so I will try this recipe again, substituting vanilla wafer cookie crumbs rolled in the powdered sugar.

WOW!  These were so much fun. Admittedly, I thought the sour cream a strange ingredient, but these were just right - not too sweet.  Everyone commented on the 'fur'.  The young boys also enjoyed eating them by dangling them above their heads by the tail.

I used chocolate caramels softened and cut into long strips to use for the tails instead - you can curl them into different shapes better.

I also had vanilla cookie crumbs for the "blonde/brown" mice. 

I found that chocolate wafers melted in 30 sec intervals in the microwave is better than chocolate chips or baker's chocolate.

These were really good once they were done. I doubled the recipe for a party.  I found I could only work with  the "dough" a little bit at a time. I would scoop some out and put it back in the fridge.  If you let it set out it gets too sticky to roll and form into the mice.  But, they were a hit. They taste like a fudgey- brownie.  The long red licorice I used for the tails, I also used for the eyes. I just cut really small pieces and stuck them in for the eye.  I would of gave it 5 stars, but I found it time consuming to make.

This was a HUGE hit at my party! It was easy to make but a little time consuming. I found it easier to work with the dough when it was a little on the warm side. They're a little time consuming, but completely worth it! A tip for presentation: cover the bottom of a foil pan with oat meal (bedding), sprinkle in chocolate sprinkles and raisinettes (droppings).

These turned out so cute.  Can't wait to hear my guest comments at the Halloween Party.  Added a little Pwd. Sugar to choc./sour cream/ cookie mixture.  Refrigerated overnight.  Very stiff the next day.  Rolled all the mice first.  Then rolled in choc. crumbs.  by the time I got to the last few they had dried out a bit and I had a hard time getting the crumbs to stick.  Could not find shoe lace licorice ANYWHERE so used something I found in the fruit roolup isle.  Eyes were some green and purple cupcake sprinkles.  Didn't do a nose.  I put pwd. sugar on my palms to roll the mice and it helped it not stick to my hand.  Maybe thats why the crumbs didn't stick.  Looked a litty mangy but hey it's Halloween!  Will make again and I'm sure share the recipe.  I doubled the batch and it made 26.  The almond slices were a little hard to work with and to find unbroken ones.  Next time I may try almond slivers instead.

Very cute even if you are an amatuer. I used chocolate graham crackers instead of cookies and they turned out great. My one mistake was not putting the graham crackers in a food processor to get them very powdery. I would definately do this so the rats aren't as difficult to form.

These were good, but a much easier version I use is stemmed cherries dipped in melted almond bark. Use a Hershey's kiss for the head. Slivered almonds for ears and red gel for the eyes and nose. Really easy and fast

I'm giving 5 stars because they were awesome. My 6 year old LOVED them. They are very similar to fudge tasting and super easy to make. I did omit the original tail and replaced it w/ melted and shaped caramels. Yumm

This recipe was a disaster.  No stars.  They were hard to shape, messy, didn't look like mice, tasted terrible and weren't worth the effort.

This recipe was just okay. Having made something very similiar before. I had high expectations. I use hershey kisses as the head, and then make chocolate covered cherries (leaving the stem out for the tail).. I still use almonds for ears.. and then a red icing pen for the nose. You can roll in cocoa, but I am not really big on that flavor.

LIFE LIKE AND TASTY. Be prepared..these are time consuming to make...but it's a fun project. They were definitely the hit of the party for both the adults and kids. I took other's advice and put them in a cardboard box and poked air holes in it. I also wrote "Warning..Live Cargo" on it. I lined the bottom of the box with Rice Crispies and sprinkled chocolate sprinkles over that to appear like litter with droppings.  These are so life like..it's creepy. When you put the cocoa powder on them they actually look fuzzy. I made some look grey and some brown.

Very easy and so much fun! I didn't have anything for the eyes, so I just put a dot of red food coloring, but it ran and it made it look like their eyes had been poked out and they were bleeding profusly.  It was pretty cool for Halloween!

This recipe was great!  Everyone commented on them.  I did change a few things though.  I doubled the recipe when I made them and I used one bag of milk chocolate chips and 2/3 cup of sour cream.  This made them more like a truffel and they tasted great.  Also, I took the advice on the caramel tails.  They worked great.  Another suggestion, especially if you make the caramel tails, is to not refrigerate them.  This made the tails stick to the foil I had them on and they all ended up pulling off.

I made these for my students because we were reading a story about mice.  The kids couldn't stop playing with them and when they finally did eat, them they loved them.  Thanks for such a creative recipe.

Our 11 yr. old made these for a Halloween party and they were a riot! So tasty, too!! We displayed ours in a shoe box with holes punched in the top, and "LAB MICE - DO NOT OPEN!" written on the lid. Have fun making these with your kids and coming up with many variations.

These are so yummy and cute! I make them every Halloween with the Black Magic Cake on this site. I make holes in the bundt cake big enough to stick the mice in so it looks like a rat infested cake! People just LOVE it!

I love this recipe.  I teach college classes and my tween daughter helps me make them for my class on the Black Death (plague carried by fleas on black rats). I do add a nose and then chocolate sprinkles (for the fleas).  My classes love them and my students share with upcoming classes so now it has become a tradition.  I have to make them for all of my classes. They are cute, tasty, and my students have never forgotten that the infected fleas were brought through Asia and Europe by the black rat. No one missed the question on the type of rat on the exam!

These are fastidious to make but delightful.  I ended up with way more than 1 dozen, which confuses me since I measured very carefully.  Used chocolate chips instead of baking squares which worked fine.  Didn't need anywhere near the 1/3 cup of cookie crumbs for rolling at the end, wasted a lot.  What turned out to be one of the most time consuming aspects was sorting through the almonds picking the best looking slices and matching pairs :) They didn't have vine licorice were I shopped, so I just grabbed Twizzlers figuring I could cut them into finer strips.  Failed.  My mice were tailless. Hee Hee.  Regardless, they were fun and actually tasted good also, very truffle like.

I just made these as a practice for my daughters up and coming birthday. what a success!!. these guys turned out so cute, were yum and easy to make. I used Choc Ripple biscuits for cookie crumbs and worked a treat. gave them a real "furry" look. My folks now want me to make them for christmas so will be adding liquor flavours and calling them "Drunken Christmas Mice". thanks for a great recipe. I also used the leftover and made little mouse droppings to scatter around the plate :D

I made these for my daughter's preschool Christmas party, and they were the only thing on the table that was completely gone and they went the fastest!  They were awesome!  I used greek yogurt because I didn't have sour cream....and it worked out great.  You can taste the yogurt though- so if you aren't a big fan don't sub it:)  Great recipe!  The kids still ask for them, and they were soooo cute:)

These were adorable in their final stage, and the kids loved them. They do taste like truffles.  You really need to grind the cookies down until they are fine.  What worked best for us was to roll a few out at a time, and put them on a plate/bowl filled with the cookie crumbs and roll them around to cover them.  They are much easier to shape when they are covered in the crumbs.  I made them all up and then we stuck the eyes, ears and tails on all of them at the end.  We made them a little bigger than a hershey kiss, so we ended up with an cookie sheet full.

These are really cute! I posted a pic on Facebook of the ones I made and it received rave reviews! I used mint (grasshopper style) cookies. They are a delicious compliment to the semi-sweet chocolate! The only thing I didn't like about making these cute little treats, was that the "dough" was hard to work with and melted quickly. These are really good frozen!

My mother LOVES to make these, although I am not patient enough to make them, we all love to eat them.  She uses white chocolate also for variety and they are really cute additions to a cookie tin.  Another variation is to dip cherries in the chocolate and let the 'tail' be the cherry stem.  She'll be so proud to see this recipe here, thanks for sharing :)

These were so realistic! I made them for my children's Halloween party last night and they really got the yuck factor! People were afraid to eat them, lol. I used the crushed Oreos and caramel tails. Thanks for the fun! Oh, they are not difficult to make, just a little messy.

Rich and very chocolatey.  The only thing I would do differently, would be to make the mice about half the size recommended in the recipe; bite sized.  Overall, a fun and tasty recipe.  I used them to decorate a cheese cake, and they were a big hit.

These were the hit of the party. Followed recipe exactly, using oreos as other have. I quadrupled the recipe and got 50 mice. Used for 3 different parties. Also used tootsie rolls halfed lengthwise, microwaved 10 sec and rolled into tails. These are very time consuming....but excellent tasting and very impressive for Halloween!

Cute. Made these with our 'tweens and they enjoyed, though I think younger kids would get more of a thrill from it. Would suggest making the mice pretty small, as they are very rich and chocolatey and a larger mouse/rat could be pretty overwhelming  to the palate. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out how to make tails of the caramel candies (experimented with 5-60 seconds in the microwave and softening in boiling/simmering water, and results were either too hot to be malleable, not soft at all, or soft for mere seconds--not long enough to form into tails). Ended up using chow mein noodles (the fried kind in the can). They were great, though it's hard to find long enough pieces to really be mouse/rat-like.  Went for ground coconut flakes for the white mice and agree that it's near-impossible to disguise the dark brown body color. Cocoa powder for brown mice gave a beautiful, velvety texture, but a horrid taste (I should've known better) and the powder smears everywhere including the mouse's eyes and ears, so not so "pretty" looking afterwards.  Great taste w/ the cookie crumbs and coconut though!  All in all, a nice recipe and a fun idea. Chocolate wafers are unheard of around here so crushed oreos worked just fine.

This recipe was amazing for my Halloween party. I made them the night before and used sprinkles for the eyes and nose. They were very cute but it take some time to get the shape down. This is definitely a recipe that should involve some practicing on the form of mice, so they are uniform. But overall, they were rich and tasty. Next time I might split the amount of semi-sweet chocolate with normal chocolate though, to make the taste less rich. But still, very yummy!

These are very cute!  My husband says they taste like fudge.  I'm taking them to my daughters preschool Halloween party so I used Frosted Flakes instead of almonds for the ears.  I didn't put noses on-I thought they looked just as cute without.  I used the chocolate cookie crumbs for the coating and it looked great.  One thing I found is that you should put the eyes, ears and tail on right as you make each one.  I tried to do it systematically and do all eyes and then all ears, etc.. and they started to crack from sitting out.  Have fun!

Great Recipe and so yummy!! Stuck to it but as others said I had a though time with the confectioners' sugar showing up and yes you should just take a couple spoon fulls and keep the rest chilled while making the mice... it gets VERY sticky and goody if not lol. Used icing gel for the noses, eyes, and almond slices for the ears. Will defiantly make again!!

I made these last year and they were a hit.  This year I am making the white chocolate mice with red eyes and red licorice tails.  2 things I picked up from other comments, make sure you put the eyes on the sides of the bodies, not the front, much more realistic.  And if you make Tootsie roll tails, don't make them in advance, they will melt down to nothing.  Thanks for the recipe!

These turned out sooo well they do take time, but well worth it.. I was sending them in to 7 year old class, so instead of almonds, I used candy corn turned upside down for the ears.. They are very very strong cholcolate flavor so they dont have to be really large.. Great idea thanks!!

My granddaughter are making these for Thanksgiving for the second year. They are fabulously funny and good! Let me tell you what I learned about the chocolate wafers..they are with the ice cream cones! Don't ask me, but that is where you'll find them - very near the ice cream!

They're relatively easy to make and tasted delicious.  I was out of almonds for the ears so I substituted with corn flakes.  I also justed dotted on white frosting for the eyes. Will definitely make this again...maybe with white chocolate for Christmas mice.

I made these exactly as written except for the eyes. I used red balls (found in the Christmas sprinkles pack.) They were really a hit at the party we took them to. (Adults) Also a big hit with my granddaughter and daughter! Fun to make, no changes to the recipe were even considered. Everyone thought they tasted great!(even took pictures!)Thanks.

This was absolutely delicious. I'm not sure exactly why some people weren't overly fond of the taste. It's basically a truffle, flavor- and texture-wise, so I guess if you don't like truffles...Anyway, everyone at my office loved them.  My food processor is broken and I couldn't get the crumbs fine enough for coating the mice, so I used cocoa powder mixed with sugar.  This was a messy project, but not difficult and totally worth it.

Very Cute!  My 7 year old step daughter and I had a ball making these.  Almost too cute to eat!  She gave a couple to our 90 year old neighbor who won't stop raving about how much they look like real mice...she won't eat them so she can show everyone! We used crushed oreos and the licorice tails.  We didn't even bother with eyes and they still turned out cute.

These were so fun, so cute and tasted yummy too. A little time consuming and I thought the mice dipped in powdered sugar looked too gross, the chocolate ones were way cuter. I did have trouble getting my eyes and nose to stick.

These mice are not only cute, but they're delicious.  I kept eating the batter while I was making them.  I made them for my daughter's preschool class and the kids and teachers loved them.  I got a large box with a lid and covered the box with foil.  I made a little mouse town and the mice were all "eating" bread.  It was so cute.

I used Chow Mein noodles for tails instead and the added crunch was fun. Also, I tried this recipe twice. Once I only coarsely crushed the chocolate cookies and the other time I sifted them to make a fine powder. The coarser one were much better. I also used Oreo cookies both times (I scraped out the insides) and they were VERY tasty. BIG hit at the halloween party!

I brought this to a Halloween party, and it was a hit! We're all college students, so it's not just for kids! 
I used wafers for half the mice, oreos for the other half, and the caramel for the tails.  Just remember to put the face, tails, and ears on before the mice get too hard.

Next time, I'll arrange them in a circle on the platter and put cheese squares in the center- that'll look great!

these are really cute, but didn't taste good enough for all the effort. even my 4 year old, who delighted in making them and looking at them, wouldn't take more than one bite. if they were only to look at, i could have made them out of playdoh. plus, after chilling, it was reallt hard to get anything (almond ears, tails, eyes) to stay in place.

What a fantastic recipe.  Such a noval idea that you can work with and build with.  I used the caramel for tails and substituted the almond ears with pumpkin seed ears.  So dang cute.  The hay (shreaded coconut with yellow food coloring) and mouse droppings (brown sprinkles) worked beautifully.  I made whoopie pies rocks with mice scattered in and around them.  Dang cute.

W-h-a-t  a HOOT! These little critters turned out really great! I used the recipe using Oreo cookies. Having read other reviews, I watched out for adding the tails and eyes. I punched little holes with a toothpick for the eyes, then put them in the freezer. Later, I dotted the eyes with gel icing (no dragees on hand)and the licorice tails poked in the dough just fine. I made a few tails with canned decorator icing using the smallest round tip. Have to say they were all adorable, but my favorites are those coated in confectioner sugar...they took on this grayish effect after sitting a while. Using them on a cake. With a fork, I dug a bit of cake out and placed one of the little varmints with his nose close to it. And the chocolate sprinkles are so like droppings! Again, so fun - can't wait to show it off!

This is a very cute recipe. It was a little time consuming but well worth it when I saw the reaction of the kids who ate the cookies. I wish that the powered sugar had covered better though.

These are delicious and great fun to make, although a fair amount of work.  The black licorice string was hard to find, also. And they're not just for kids, either. I work in a construction company and our "guys" snarfed them down like they hadn't eaten in a week. Thanks, Rosina, for the idea. I think this "dough" will work for other shapes and holiday critters, also.

I thought this would be a fun recipe to do with my four year old but the "dough" was so sticky it was nearly impossible to shape.  After a few failed attempts to attach the tails/ears/eyes (that wouldn't stay in without ruining the shape of the mouse) we ended up using a cookie scoop and just rolling them into balls; they tasted fine, but not worth the trouble.

Just OK.  Very cute though.  I thought I would like it because I like sour cream so much but I was underwhelmed.

I made these for a "Translyvanian Feast" I'd post a pic if I could figure out how to do it. I made 3 colors of mice and used softened carmels in long strings for tails and used them on a cake. It was great!

These were a big hit at our Halloween party. They are so cute and they taste good too. As for the tails not sticking--I just poked my licorice into their little behinds and they stayed put. I also found that they are easier to shape if the batter is not completely stiff. Highly recommended!

These are wonderful!! An absolute hit at our Halloween party. I had to change a few things but they are so much fun. I used 3 chocolate squares instead of 4. I used  whole (filling too) chocolate fudge oreos for the mixture and then scraped the filling off a few for the crumbs to roll thelittle critters in after shaping their bodies.  I couldn't find the eyes, so I bought mini jawbreakers for eyes. The jawbreakers were white with red and blue, which gave the mice a really wild eyed look.  I then lined a small brown box with coconut and sprinked the little brown chocolate sprinkles for droppings. They were a riot! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These little mice were SO cute.  I won a prize for it, thanks Rosina!  Some advice:  they were very easy, but they took a while to make (I tripled the recipe).  I didn't really have them in the refrigerator too long before I started to mold the bodies.  I found it easier to mold the bodies, roll them in the outer covering, and then I waited for them to harden a little to put the face and tail on.  I also used caramel tails like another reviewer suggested.  Unfortunately, I had no silver eyes, only colored ones.  Anyway, they were fun to make.

This was great! I couldn't beleive how everyone went on and on about these cute little mice. I just added 2 or three into the usual holiday cookies I pass out every year at Christmas time and people thought they were great. Ver fun to make too. I even made white mice with red beety eyes.

I did sub cream cheese for some of the sour cream. Good flavor and so cute! Made both white and brown mice. Used caramel for the tails. They looked real enough that my granddaughter, who was 6 years old at the time was hesitant to eat one. Her 4 year old brother bit the head off and said it was juicy. Yeah, he's that guy.

I used this recipe as a kitchen project for my 3 1/2 year-old. It was fun and took a nice long time for him...especially making crumbs of the chocolate gram crackers. the dough was a bit difficult to work with, so I made the shapes, but he did the rest on his own. we broke up M&Ms for eyes. the taste was pretty good, but not great to my taste.

Two little girls accompanied their parents to our home for dinner last evening--the chocolate mice were a great hit.  The ones I rolled in powdered sugar were not as attractive as the ones I rolled in the chocolate crumbs.  I also served the apple teeth as appetizers and they also were great fun for the children.  I used the idea from the Snake Stromboli and just did "snake" bread using a frozen bread dough.  They loved it!  Thanks!

I made a big batch of these for my dorm as part of a "midterm snack" event, and they were a huge hit. Everyone loved them. I used Oreos instead of regular wafer cookies, and as everyone else has promised they work just as well; also, I used regular chocolate chips instead of squares, since I was making so many, and those also worked perfectly. I followed the suggestion to use caramel for the tails instead of licorice, which everyone in my dorm seemed to agree with. What's great is that I multiplied this recipe by five and it still came out perfectly--everyone was raving about how good and chocolatey they were and couldn't believe there were only three ingredients. I'm already starting a collection fund to make them again next weekend!

I made these as treats for a Sunday family dinner and they were a hit. They look adorable and are very simple to make. I used crushed up chocolate Teddy Grahams (instead of crushed up chocolate cookies) along with Hershey's dark chocolate squares and I thought that combo worked really well. The chocolate mixture tasted very similar to a chocolate truffle.

I used chocolate animal crackers instead of cookies (I actually couldn't find just plain chocolate cookies in the grocery) and they were fantastic! My 3 year old now asks for them over any other cookie which is quite a complement since she is so picky. I tried them myself and while they are not really my thing they were very good. Even if they had been awful the fun I had making these with my daughter and the squeals I got from her as we put their ears and eyes on was well worth the effort!

I go one step further.  I make the mice similar to these but then I take a graham cracker  and break it into quarters (on the lines) take mini candy canes and put them on the bottom of the graham cracker with cake icing (making a sled) the I attach the mice on the sleighs with cake icing.  They are a big hit

I took these to a Halloween party last night and won first place for most creative dessert! They looked SO realistic. Kids and adults alike said to me with giggling excitement: "I bit off the head!!!" I'm SO happy that I made these! 
It took me three hours total. I combined the first three ingredients the night before and left it in the refrigerator, and then made and decorated the mice the next day. Just like a few other people, I made the tails out of caramel instead of using licorice. I also used decorating gel for the eyes. Poking holes with the flat end of a wooden skewer helps tremendously for placing the eyes and the tail. They turned out to be perfect!
For containment I used a two-level cake carrier. I spread the remaining cookie crumbs on the trays (to portray filth), and also used the remaining mouse-making mixture to make a few small, VERY realistic-looking mouse turds (I was actually complimented for this)! As many people have said, DO plan to spend a lot of time preparing these cute, creepy, yummy mice! It'll be well worth your time!

These took a lot less time to make than I expected them to.  I made two double batches, one with semi-sweet chocolate chips and one with white chocolate chips.  For the cookie crumbs, I used chocolate and regular animal crackers.  I made the cutest black and tan mice.  I tried to roll the tan ones in powdered sugar but I think they looked better with just the crumbs.  I used the dough blade on my food processor and just dumped everything in and it worked beautifully.  I used a small cookie scoop and it literally took me one hour to form all the mice (4 batches).  I put granola on the plate that I served them on and it was super cute.  I also dropped a few cocolate sprinkles to make a few mice "droppings". Don't be afraid to make these!

I loved this recipe! I couldn't find chocolate cookie crumbs, so I used Double Stuffed Oreo's and placed the mice on the left-over cream fillings. After reading some of the reviews though, I think that next time I'll go with the chocolate filled oreo's or chocolate graham crackers. and I used red-hots for the nose, and didn't use anything for the eyes. Everyone loved them! several friends said that the red-hots were a nice balance to the chocolaty mouse. I found that it was very messy to shape them and the powered sugar didn't work out as well. It wasn't consistent, it kind of soaked into the mouse. But all in all, these are well worth the work! I'm definitely going to be making these again!

I have made these mice many times.  They are fun to make and a hit at parties. in CA the dragees are illegal and not sold so I use red hots or small red candies for eyes and black licorice laces for tails

I decided to try something different with these when making them this time. I used Andes mint pieces for cooking instead of the semi-sweet chocolate. Made for some awesome tasting mice! Also, instead of using the licorice or carmels for the tails, try using Tootsie Rolls. You can get 3 or 4 tails out of one mini. No need to heat in the microwave, just use the palm of your hand and a flat surface to roll them out. I do suggest cutting the roll before you completely roll it out, gets harder to roll when it is starts to get to long to handle. As with carmels, wait to place them in the mice, they do not handle the refrigerator well.

this was fun and i made it with my little brother who is 8 years old, however when it came time to munch on them i checked them and not only had they bocome soggy and un appetizing after sitting in the refrigerator but they were also still very soft, we didn't care for them. fun and worth the time yet no on ate them, also it was very hard to roll them in the powdered sugar, it was  a very messy project

This recipe is not so much about eating the mice (they are okay enough) as it is about the whole yuck factor.  This caused me to win a $50 gift card at a company Halloween party!!!

These were perfect for my Halloween party.  I was a bit leary of them because I didn't think something so cute would be easy but it was.  I used nerds candy for the nose and for the eyes I just used colored sprinkles.  They are very rich and chocolatey! My guests ate them up!

Mice came out cute, but it was extremely sugary sweet.  Added 2 cups of rice cereal, dry milk powder and a pinch of salt.  It was still too sweet.  Will not be making this again.

These were easy to shape and they look good. For the tails I rolled caramel candy which looked very realistic and also resembled worms until attaching them. The taste is ok, although I would prefer if they were just a little more sweet.

They sound like they would be delicious but you would have to have a strong stomach to be able to eat these with the extras that people used to enhance the effects of them. Mouse droppings and blood are not in the least bit appetizing to me. Would be fun to make.

AWESOME!! so easy to make and very very yummy.  I ran out of crushed oreos so I rolled my mice in a mix of sugar and cocoa powder to get them a nice light brown.  My white mice I used confectionner's sugar and next time I would definitely use ground coconut since the sugar sort of melds into the chocolate and makes the mice spotty.   I left a few mice just plain chocolate with no coating and they looked the best to me.

This is a great recipe!  Everyone loved it!  Not only does is look great, but it tasted great too!  My husband's birthday is on Halloween, so I did these instead of cake.  I doubled the recipe, but was in a hurry, so after I made 12 mice I rolled the rest into truffle sized balls.  Everything got eaten!  Definitely try these!  I also took these to a cookie party and won first place for most creative!

Very time consuming, but worth it!  I used Teddy Grahams and didn't have many left over to roll the mice in, so I mixed a packet of hot chocolate mix with the left over crumbs.  It gave the mice a nice color.  I also rolled them in coconut, but that didn't look very good, although yummy.  They are very rich.  I liked some of the other suggestions of cutting down on some of the chocolate.  I doubled my batch and made some into round truffles and covered them w/sprinkles or coconut.

These were time consuming but fun. I substituted cream cheese for sour cream - it just sounded tastier. For white mice I used vanilla sandwich cookies - filling and all - in a food processor and vanilla chips. For brown mice I used peanut butter sandwich cookies, peanut butter chips, and peanut butter instead of the sour cream.

these were a big hit at my Halloween party!  I recomend using waffers and chocolate that aren't too sweet because the powdered sugar really does the trick.

I am very bad with craft-type projects, so it took me a little practice to get the hang of this, but not much. 

My grocery store did not have the silver candies for the eyes, so I used red ones like the type used in Christmas cookies, which added a nice spooky effect. 

Mouse-maker tip: Use a knife to make dents that the almond ears can be slid into and a toothpick to insert the tail.

This recipe was definately a hit.  I made it for a Halloween potluck at work and everyone just loved them.  They do take a lot of time, but they are well worth it.  I substituted red eyes and red licorice tail.   They turned out awesome.  Thanks again, I'll be making these again for sure.

The taste was great! The confectioners' sugar seemed to melt into the mice...they ended up fairly sticky.  However, the kids loved them!  Maybe I just need more practice and a cooler place to serve them.  Fun recipe, will try again!

These were sooo much fun to make.  You can really get creative with them.  I used oreos for one batch and teddy grahams for another.  Both were very yummy.  I took them to a party and received so many compliments on them.  They were gone fast!

This recipe turned out just as the previous reviews had indicated. The mice were a real hit at the adult halloween party we attended and everyone wanted the recipe. The mice were quite a bit of work to make, and the white variety didn't work out as well as the brown. But when they were all sat together on a cheese plate they looked adorable.

This recipe was very successful!  I actually think the adults were more thrilled by the mice then the kids, but by the end of the party they were all gone.  I will follow suggestions and try varying the outside with coconut, sprinkles and so on.

My sister's birthday is Halloween so I made these to place on top of a cake (chocolate of course  since that's a staple of her diet). I did use almond slices for ears and  red rope or untwisted licorice for tails and whiskers. Made white mice by rolling in confectioners sugar. Fun project. I'm a kid at heart.

I used chocolate teddy grahams and my mice ended up tasting just  like wonderful brownies!   The only change for next time, smash the cookies until they’re totally chocolate crumbs.  Mine weren’t fine enough, the larger pieces were too big to be on the outside.  
 
Everybody loved them!  Tasty and cute!

These are just too perfect for Halloween! Extremely simple recipe. I was unsure of the sour cream, but everything evens out so well with flavor- my roommate even suggested a hint of “coconut” with the almond ears mixed in. I suggest crushing the chocolate cookies/wafers very finely for this. And rolling the chocolate mixture into form as you go, otherwise it will begin to dry out a bit quickly! But overall, these were very easy to make, and relatively quick! They are a crowd pleaser- and I’d like to try the white, powdered sugar version next time! I like the suggestion of red-hot candies for eyes, too!

I make these every year for Christmas gifts with various flavors of Oreo's and people go nuts over them for the holidays.  
Here are some tips:

Lemon Oreos...use white chocolate and add about 1 tsp of Lemon Extract in the chocolate, then about 1 tsp lemon zest in the cookie mix...DELICIOUS!!!

You don't have to make mice...you can mold these into little molds, then dip them in chocolate...you could then coat the chocolate in crumbs for texture...

It's cheaper to use Nerds candy for the eyes--and if you get a multi color box,  you can have different colored eyes (I steal some Nerds from the Grandkids Halloween candy--just the right amount, and the price is right...o please, you know you've eaten some of their stuff...don't judge me.)

These mice are awesome!  I made 50 of these for may daughter's 7th grade Halloween party.  No need to use the expensive Oreos, I used both those and store brand chocolate cookies with the white filling and found the store brand to be easier to crush with a rolling pin on parchment paper.  Used sour cream for filling.  I made my own chocolate by using 3 oz of white chocolate melting discs (had in cabinet and wanted to use up) and added 1 oz chocolate chips.  Melted in microwave and added to cookie crumbs and sour cream.  The longer this mixture stays in the fridge the easier it is to work with.  I made 12 mice with one recipe.  To decorate I used sunflower seeds as ears due to nut allergy at school, along with a mini tootsie roll that I quartered and rolled in my hands to make 4 slender tails.   My grocery store had the little white pearls and I made half with those for eyes and half with sprinkles for eyes.  So much easier to insert the pearls as eyes than sprinkles.  After shaping the mice I rolled in cookie crumbs then cut a small slit for the tail, added that and the eyes all at once.  I found making 3 separate batches made the dough easier to work with and I was able to whip out 12 mice in no time, per batch  When I tripled the recipe it bombed.....I put the bowl  in the fridge for about 3 hours and when I tried working with the mixture it was sticky  and too hard to work with. I added extra cookie crumbs and had to refrigerate again.  Next time I make these I will defini

These turned out perfect yet again! Doubling the recipe created 32 mice. A whole package of generic oreos ground in the food processor created enough crumbs for the dough and the coating. Dough needs to chill AT LEAST an hour before shaping. I put in the freezer for an additional 15 minutes before I get my hands on it. I shape truffle sized balls and immediately coat them in the crumbs before I shape the pointed nose (it's easier to work with after it's coated). I use a small paring knife to create a hole to stick in the licorice tail (I use twizzler pull & peel). Once all the mice are shaped and tailed, I place the ears and eyes. After chilling, display on a bed of crispy rice cereal.

I was skeptical because many "cutsie" cookies are often just not tasty.  However, these were good.  I did make some changes using Twizzlers for tails & small red candy cake decorations for eyes.  We only made the chocolate ones & used thin Oreos with chocolate filling.  Everyone loved them! It did make several more than the recipe said it would.

I usually follow a recipe the first time them decide if I want to make a change.  Took them to work  and my coworkers kept telling how cute they were. One of the guys say they were so cute, he didn't want to eat it. He'd feel quilts and then he wouldn't have it to look at.  Solved his problem. Told him to take two, eat one  and look at the other.

Impossible to find crushed chocolate cookie pieces here in the states unless you shop online (hint, plan ahead). I used graham cracker crumbs instead. I found cooling it overnight made it almost rock like and my hands needed to warm it to make it easier to shape. Tasty though!

This is the second time around making these darling treats.  Today, (Halloween) I decided to make them again since we have a couple people coming to dinner and I altered the recipe a bit.  I used whipped cream cheese in place of the sour cream and double fudge sandwich cookies (Mother's brand) for the crumbs.  since they were meant to be an adult snack I added a tad of dark rum to half the mixture. These were easy to mold without chilling and the crushed (very fine) sandwich cookies made a great outer layer.  I wanted the eyes beady so I used sprinkles poked the long way in.  These are so dang cute & so easy to play around with different ingredients.  I'm going to stick with the type of cookies I used and cream cheese, they taste like truffles!

These were so cute! I made 2 different batches: 1 with the original recipe (though I had to substitute chocolate graham crackers for the chocolate wafers, as the wafers were nowhere  to be found), and the other batch with cream cheese, as suggested by another reviewer. I did not like the cream cheese version, as it  was so thick and heavy that it broke my cookie scoop AND I had to triple the amount of melted chocolate to absorb most of the ground graham crackers (and I still had a lot of that left over. 

I will stick with the original recipe in the future because I liked the results better, in appearance, mouth feel (smooth and creamy, and taste.

I got the candy eyes for higher realism, though don't know if they are a seasonal item (since it's near Halloween here), and thought they turned out great.

My boyfriend thought both versions were tasty.

Haven't a clue.  Don't have time to make right now.  I don't always make what save in the same time frame.  I print for holidays and meals.  I buy a month in advance.  Currently  no time for the mice.  Maybe xmas

They tasted okay, but very rich.  In addition, I made 6 of them and just knew I was wasting my time because they creeped out my family.  Easy enough, but as I said, creepy.

I doubled the recipe to make 25 mice. As the "detailing" takes a while it was easier to make them all at once. Very realistic :-)

I didn't use cookie crumbs the first time, but cake crumbs from the chocolate cake pops recipe on this site. Made them small, so could put white and milk choco chips as ears and silver dragees for eyes and nose. Big hit with the kiddies!

Made these for my childrens bake sale.  Only had to substitute the ears.  Used cooked pumpkin seeds in there shells.
Rolled some in white coconut too.   Didn't turn out as nice as the ones rolled in cookie crumbs or powdered sugar.
Definitely need to double receipt.  
Try to keep cold or have cold hands.  Can only make a few at a time.

I worked at a grocery store and we had bring your scary dish in I made the Chocolate mice recipe, scary eye balls and the mouse loafs. Huge hit everyone loved them. Think next time I make these I will use half powdered sugar and half Teddy Grahams. To share a trick I used, I dunked my hands in ice cold water to cool them down enough to handle the chocolate so they wouldn't melt.

These were adorable. I liked them more for their aesthetic appearance rather than their taste. I am not really a truffle fan and thats what they turned out to be. They were so cute on my table and my guests loved them! thanks for the recipe!

I made these for my daughter who lives in Chicago, and send them in a plastic container with (as suggested) some "droppings" (chocolate sprinles) I made the eyes with the silver dragees, which BTW took me several trips to stores to find. I also used the caramel apple sheet to make the tails, and I rolled ten to the cookies in chocolate crumbs, and two in white poweder sugar, which by the way started to dissolved when place in the refrigerator (due to condensation), so next time I will not make them with sugar. I made a note like someone mentioned: "rat lab, open with caution. Droppings are a natural action when rats make a long trip to Chicago" I used the Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers, and I used only 1/2 a box to make the dozen mice. A fun recipe, and they looked so cute! I sent the recipe to my granddaughter in Los Angeles for their Halloween party - a real treat!

I made these using silver dragees for eyes and caramel sheets (for caramel apples), cut into strips and rolled into tails.  They were so realistic on my Halloween cupcakes and a huge hit at work. These were the only dessert at the pot luck to get goobled up and still had people left who didn't get any.  And they tasted as good as they looked!

My son and I made these for his school's bake sale. We packaged each in a cupcake cup put in a snack-sized sandwich bag. They were quite cute, and everyone must have liked them because there were none left of the 50+ we made by the end of the evening.

Pretty tasty but I'd save for edible decorations around other food as this doesn't make many mice.  
The store didn't have cookie crumbs, so I mashed up chocolate teddy grahams and when that wasn't enough, used graham cracker crumbs until I got enough.  I also used dark chocolate baking squares since this was what I had. Very rich and chocolatey and surprisingly easy to make them look like mice.  Very cute!

My son and I had so much fun making these for Halloween. Everybody got a kick out of them. I couldn't find licorice whips so we used thin pretzel sticks for tails. They were actually very easy to make too.

Very cute, but very time consuming.  As far as taste goes, these were definately not a favorite.  All in all, these cookies are very cute for a kid's party, but not something most adults enjoyed eating.

The kids loved these; they taste a lot like brownies and are so cute!  The eyes and tail didn't want to stick to the confectioner's suger though, easier on the ones covered in cookie crumbs.
