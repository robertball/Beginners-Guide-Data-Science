I made this recipe over the weekend for a family party, it was a big hit!!  It is super simple to make and very tasty.  I think it tastes better after being chilled in the refrigerator for an hour or so.  I served it with potato chips.  I used a bit less mayo and a bit more horseradish sauce, but that was just my own personal taste.

It was ok as is.  We thought it was a little bland so we added 1/2t onion powder and 1/2t garlic powder.  It was great after that.  Hubby decided to tweak it one more time and added some choped chipoles. It was awsome!

Excellent dip to eat with celery or any other dipping veg.  Hot, but not to hot.  Flavors blend nicely together.

I'm giving this a four because I made a few changes. Instead of canned shrimp I used some cooked, peeled shrimp that I had on hand, and just chopped them up. Then I added artichoke hearts and black olives and heated the whole thing up with some Jack and parmesan cheeses on top. Yum. Mee. I'm eating it with tortilla chips. Love the horseradish!

SO good I could eat it all by myself! I followed the recipe exactly. Much better than some of the other seafood dips I have made from this site. I thought the red food coloring was strange, but it did make the dip visually appealing. Thanks for the recipe

Love this dip! Sweet and spicy, just wonderful! I did made a few changes:
~Sour cream not mayonnaise.. I almost always do this for dips
~Put in almost 3 tsp horseradish... we love shrimp sauce :)
~Probably more like 1/2-3/4 tsp worcestershire sauce 
~Added catsup (2 Tb?) because we didn't have red food coloring and it goes in typical shrimp sauce anyway

Simple to make with just the right amount of heat. Place in the fridge for an hour. The red food coloring is not necessary if you use a red hot sauce such as Sriracha or Frank's Red Hot.

Love when other reviewers offer suggestions... I also substituted sour cream for mayo.  Used a little less than the full amount of cream cheese and a bit more horseradish (we were entertaining that night and our friends like it hot!).   I also used fresh rock shrimp and cut it into small pieces.  Delicious.

A great base!  I left out the red food colouring and horseradish, and opted for 1/4 tsp dried chipotle powder, and 1/2 package frozen chopped spinach, VERY well drained.  Tastes amazing already, and the spinach adds a nice green splash.  Can't wait for the guests to arrive!
