This is a very nice, quick antipasto recipe.  Some are so involved it takes forever to prepare and is expensive as well.  Works well before a meal as it is not as heavy as some.  Thanks.

This was so good! I always liked the vegetables in antipasto platter, but not the traditional meats. I was glad when I found one that just had ham. For the cucumber I did 3 mini ones. The skins are not tough and the seeds are small, so I didn't need to remove either. If I was using English cucumbers I would have done the same. I decided since I was buying a bunch of ingredients, that I might as well go with a better brand bottle of dressing. I chose one called Girards Italian dressing. It had a real light and not a tart flavor of most Italian bottled dressings. I thought there wasn't much tomatoes or olives in the salad, so I added a little more to my bowl along with a tad extra dressing. I will make this again, but more likely for a party. Thank you.

I took on Johnsonville's challenge of substituting a protein in a 6-ingredient or less recipe with one of their sausages. I chose to substitute the ham in this recipe for their Sweet Italian Sausage. It worked well. What I liked about this recipe is that it was quick and simple.

I made this for a BBQ my family went to as I needed a recipe with little to no starch for a friend with bypass surgery.  I added black olives  and changed the mozzarella cheese for 1/4 lb. each of colby and monterey jack cheeses.  This is close to my Pasta Insalata recipe but without the pasta.  It's great for those who cannot have starches.  My friend loved it, and I've already given her the recipe.  This recipe allows for a lot of variations for the meat and cheeses.  I used smoked ham, but I plan on trying it with black forest later.  
I recommend adding more olives and tomatoes to help balance the food out.  Compared to the cheese, meat, and cucumber, there are not a lot of tomatoes and olives. Please give this a try even with the few reviews.
