My family loves this dish. I have a picky 5 yr. old who only wants pizza and hot dogs. This dish has become her favorite. I made a few changes. I started off by sauteeing a frozen 3 pepper and onion blend in evoo with minced garlic. I then added the Italian  sausage to it. I used 2 16 oz. jars of Spaghetti Sauce instead of 1. I took out the black olives and added frozen spinach. I used 16oz. of mozzarella as well. I had enough left over for leftovers for my lunch and dinner again. This was totally full of awesomeness.

This was an easy delicious recipe.  I mixed frozen spinach that was drained in with the cottage cheese.

This recipe owns because it's cheap and you can really stretch it to feed whoever you've got hanging around. Most of the ingredients used in this dish was bought either at Dollar Tree or Grocery Outlet. No italian sausage on hand, but I did have a pound of ground beef. I sauteed one onion and a couple minced cloves of garlic in EVOO, then added the meat. My boys aren't big on cottage cheese, so I only used 12 oz. and I added another 14 oz. jar of Ragu. I tasted it and thought it needed a little something, so I added a tsp. of Italian seasoning and a couple shakes of Frank's Hot Sauce. My boys and I ate the heck out of this. I love how you can make this casserole to suit your family. I served it with Parmesan Herb Bread, which is also from this site. This recipe makes a lot so make sure you're hungry. I'd like to make this again and see if I can't cut back on the meat and use more fresh chopped veggies, like carrots, zucchini and spinach.

This was SO EASY to make and it turned out perfectly.  My fiancee hates olives, though, so I eliminated those.  He suggested using mushrooms instead, so I'll have to try that next time.  Will definitely be using this recipe again!

This was sooooooo Good!!! I layered the mozzarella and cottage cheese in between it made it even better!!! Next time I will do the same and add peperoni in the middle too. I used a small green pepper and onion to season the meat more.. Will make again and again.

Double the sauce, cut the cottage cheese in half, or I wouldn't make it. Made this for a friend, and her family. They had to add sauce to their plates to get through it, and try to scrape half the cottage cheese off. Also, if you want it to have flavor, add onions, garlic, maybe peppers and oregano. When I made it, the sauce BARELY coated the pasta. It just really needs more sauce, less cottage cheese. Won't make this again.

This was delicious!  However, if I make it again, I will add Italian Seasoning...maybe some spinach, and mushrooms to spice it up.  It's one of those recipes that you can do a variety of things to.  My husband loved it!

This is a solid recipie. It's very lasagne-esque and pretty dang tasty. I only changed a few little things. I used ground beef seasoned with rosemary and Salt, Pepper, Garlic instead of the sausage (I think it would be better with spicy italian sausage though). I also added a little shredded Parmesean cheese to the Cottage Cheese/Mozz mix. I kept everything else the same as the recipie described. My only real complaint about the recipie is that there was not enough sauce. I useed a 12 oz. jar of sauce and it was still not enough. I would recommend at lease 18 oz. of sauce for this recipie unless you like the noodles a little on the dry side. Other than that, it's pretty a pretty great hot dish. Especially for cheese lovers like me and my wife.

I've made this recipe a few times now. I substitute the olives for mushrooms. Other than that the recipe is great as is. Substituting hamburger for the italian sausage is NOT the same-stick with the italian sausage. It tastes great and lasts well throughout the week :)

This was simple to make and tastes great. The cottage cheese really adds to the dish. I made half for supper and froze the other half for later.

Good casserole, whole family like it.  I added a small can of mushrooms as well as the olives and it was yummy.  I made it ahead and froze it and it heated up nicely.

I needed an easy but good recipe for my daughters baby shower. I was thinking of lasagna, but didn't want all the work involved. I thought of noodles in a meat sauce, but that seemed so blaa. When I saw the picture with this recipe, I knew this was it. I realized that this can be classified as a "lazy lasagna" since all the ingredients are the same.   I made it in a deep crock pot, so I did  2 layers. I put 1/2 the noodles in sauce in the pot and 1/2 the cottage cheese, then the rest of the noodles and cheese and topped with the mozzarella cheese and pepperoni. I then put the inside pot of the cooker into the oven until the cheese was melted and bubbly (350 for about 1/2 hour)  I read the other reviews where some said it was dry, so I had another crock pot on the table with some extra spaghetti sauce. I lot of people added sauce to it.   I did make one change to the recipe, I only used 1/2 cottage cheese and the other 1/2 used ricotta.  Everyone who ate it loved it and asked for the recipe. One word of advise, we had a few vegitarians at the party that we forgot about. I'm sorry I didn't make a second batch with maybe spinach and/or broccoli in it for them.

this was awesome and so easy!!  I used my homemade spaghtti sauce and also used fusilli noodles instead of Rotini.  A HUGE hit at my house but I will follow other suggestions for next time.  That being that I will layer the cheese mixture- meat and noodles, then cheese mixture, then meat and noodle mixture, then the cheese mixture to top it.  We love cheese!  You will love this recipe!

This was delicious. I don't like black olives but I added them anyway and I actually think it added to the flaver. I shaved the recipe in half and used almost  whole 24 oz can of pasta sauce and it wasn't to saucy.   Even halfing it makes a lot.  I think it could serve at least 6 especially if your having a veggie and garlic toast with it.

This was delicious!!! I absolutely was surprised by the combination of all the flavors. I think the cottage cheese was the biggest surprise to how it compliments the pepperoni. I can't wait to make this dish again. Yummy!!!!

Personally I just wasn't in love w/ this recipe. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't anything special. I had never cooked Italian sausage before, so mine was a little undercooked. Plus I'm not a big fan of sausage in general. I also didn't feel like it had enough flavor. I used ricotta instead of cream cheese I believe it was. I may make it again, but I would suggest using some italian seasoning next time.

This is very tasty! I added a bit more cheese (can never have too much) and a bit more sauce. About 20 oz of sauce.

This is soooooo good. Hearty, delicious, creamy, savory, it's got it all. It's perfect as is, but next time we're going to sneak in some more vegetables - sauteed green peppers, onions and mushrooms.  I love the sausage links from the butcher's block in Whole Foods (I de-case them when I get home).  Also loved this with Barilla's sweet pepper sauce.  Unless I have 2 bags of shredded mozz on hand, I just use 1 (8 oz vs 12 oz) and I haven't missed it, and believe me, I love my cheese!  We also used the Barilla Plus pasta, and some extra sauce (the entire 24 oz jar) which made it a lot less chewy.  One last note is that turkey pepperoni totally does not cut it and dries out terribly during baking. We'll go back to full fat pepperoni next time!  Also, I love black olives but didn't feel they were necessary here - the flavor just stood out.

Good pasta dinner.  Loved the taste of the Italian sausage.  For the first time making this - I made as written, minus the olives (we don't care for them).  The next time I make this I will add chopped green and/or red pepper and diced onions.  This recipe went together very quickly and we enjoyed our meal.  Thanks CKROPER for the tasty recipe.

This was pretty good.  My kids and husband seemed to like it.  It was really, really greasy, though.  I followed the recipe as written with the exception of adding chopped up bell pepper and a bit of fresh onion (we like that on pizza) and I only did half of what the recipe called for in pepperoni.  Used whole wheat pasta.  The taste was ok, but because of the greasiness, I won't make it again.

This was very good, I added fresh bell pepper, onion and sauteed that with the sausage, then added a little baking soda to the sauce to cut the acidity.  It was very very good.  The kids loved it, but they say they wish it had more pepperoni ....

This was OK.  It did NOT need sausage!  I do not like white pasta I just do not like the flavor so I will use wheat if I make this again plus it makes it way more healthy.  As far as the cottage cheese mixture DELICIOUS!

I love Ricotta but had read a review that it made this dry.  So, I used one container of cottage cheese and one container of ricotta mixed with an egg and it turned out great!  My son and fiance LOVED it!  It was eaten for every meal after I made it until it was gone :)

My husband, son and I all loved this when I made it the other night! I had to use elbow macaroni because it's all we had. I also left out the olives because my husband isn't a big fan. Definitely came out DELICOUS though! My husband said it kind of tasted like a yummy calzone! This is a wonderful budget/family friendly recipe too. It was such a big casserole my husband has been able to take left overs to work for three days now. He's still lovin it! :) I most definitely will be making this one again and again!

This is a good casserole in a flash recipe. We didn't have italian sausage, so I used diced pepperoni and some frozen meatballs to mix in with the pasta and sauce. Probably could go without and still have this taste good. I added some italian seasonings for some zip. Definitely a good recipe for a potluck (I brought it to church and it was gone in a flash while other dishes around it stood partially eaten).

I really like this, but I opted to use ricotta instead of the cottage cheese, and it was a bit dry.  Next time I'll try the cottage cheese, or add 2 eggs to loosen the ricotta. Per other reviewers, I also added a generous amount of italian seasoning and omitted the olives. Otherwise, it was great.  Makes a huge casserole, so unless you're feeding a big crowd you may want to cut the recipe in half.  Thanks for a great idea!

Very easy to make, tastes great, makes a great leftover.  I have tried another recipe like this that doesn't have the pepperoni and I really enjoy the added pepperoni part.

This was delicious! Changes I made were simply to tailor the dish to my liking, such as using a 12 oz. box of rotini because we like our pasta casseroles to have a good meat/pasta balance.  Also, I only had about a 3/4 c. of cottage cheese, added it nonetheless, and lastly scaled back the pepperoni to half.  Can't wait to make this dish again!  Would be great for a pot luck!

Easy to make and inexpensive too. I used 2 jars of Ragu six cheese sauce and added Italian seasonings and crushed red peppers (we like spicy), put the olives in the sauce.  I did use mild sausage as I was afraid the hot would make it too hot, thus the peppers.  Used 12 ounces of ricotta instead of 24 of the cottage cheese and 16 ounces of mozzarella. Baked 35 minutes, we like the pepperoni crispy.  Next time will add fresh chopped green pepper, maybe some onion and use 1/2 hot sausage and 1/2 ground beef leaving the crushed red peppers for a topper. My 21 year old son liked it but says no olives next time.  He would eat it again.

Excellent, not a thing I would change.  Be generous with your pepperoni's because they shrink up when cooked.  I made a 4 serving version in a standard casserole dish.

This was great! I couldn't imagine how we'd like this with cottage cheese but we really liked it and will definitely have this again!  Like many others, I did add another 8oz tomato sauce and did swap out black olives for mushrooms - my family doesn't care for black olives unfortunately but this will become a regular for us - everyone loved it!

I've been making this for years...only no cottage cheese and I use lasagna noodles and make layers instead. I use to use cut lasagna noodles, but can't find them anymore. Try adding a little cracked red pepper if you want to spice it up!

Quick, easy and economical. Took it to a pot luck and brought home the empty dish. I did add more sauce. I added 2 tsp. italian seasoning to the cheese mixture for more flavor I also used a 24 oz jar of sauce and then added about 6 more oz as I didn't want it to be to dry when I took it out of the oven. It turned out great! Great recipe for kids.

Rated a 4 because I thought it was a little bland.  However, my husband and kids really loved it!  My daughter was a little worried when I asked her to mix the spinach with the cottage cheese....they called me at work to let me know they enjoyed it.  Thank you!

My entire family ate this up. I made 2 large dishes and both were gone by the end of the night. I followed the recipe, expect I added italian season to the meat as it cooked and I added extra cottage cheese and mozzeralla. It turned out perfect. Even my 2 year old loved it.

Delicious!  I used whole wheat pasta, chicken sausage, turkey pepperoni, Wegmans four cheese pasta sauce, 2% cottage cheese and fat free shredded mozzarella.  It was a delicious and healthy meal (only 8 points on WW) and my family LOVED it!  A hearty, healthy, and easy-to-make dinner! Thanks!

Make this more healthy by using Turkey sausage and Turkey pepperoni, and adding a package of chopped spinach (sauteed in garlic) to the cheese mixture.  I have 4 kids ages 12, 3, 2, and 1, and they all devoured it, and not one of them asked me what the green stuff was.  The 12 year old had a friend over when I served this and the friend said it was one of the best meals he's ever had.  I waited until they were all finished to tell them about the cottage cheese!!

This is awesome! I did add some mushrooms. The sausage and spaghetti sauce was enough flavor for me. I plan to make this for our next potluck at work.

Great dish, full flavor, nice texture. Next time I'll buy better quality pepperoni, the brand I used added an excessive amount of oil making the top a little greasy but still a great dinner.

This is just another run of the mill casserole. Nothing spectacular but very easy to put together if you’re in a hurry.

This is the best!! 3 of my kids got full off from just one row of it.  My husband doesn't like recipes like this and I caught him eating out of the pan, it's that good.  I added a little Italian seasoning to the meat and used a 25 oz jar of sauce but otherwise followed the recipe as it's written. I will definitely make this again.

My only complaint was that 16 oz of pasta sauce didn’t exist in my local grocery store.  Other than the lack of a little sauce since I used 12oz the recipe was exact and easy.  Actually I didn’t make it my 13 year old did it with no assistance from an adult.

I didn't have black olives and added some saute mushrooms and stew tomatoes to toss with sauce and sausage. I used half the amount of cheeses and there was still enough to spread out. I then layer on top of the cheese mixture thinly sliced onion before a layer of pepperoni slices.  Everyone had two helpings...I guess it was a hit.

This is delicious. I made this with  a mix of sage sausage and ground turkey. Used roasted red pepper pasta sauce. We aren't black olives fans, so I substituted fresh sauteed mushrooms. This is a wonder as is and lends itself to creativity. Next time I'll add green pepper and onion, maybe try different pasta sauce. Definitely a keeper!

I loved this recipe! I did make some changes to spice it up a bit, especially since I couldn't get ahold of ground italian sausage. So I did the following:
Used tricolor rotini for color. Didn't use the black olives. Also used ground beef instead of sausage, cooked with three slices of bacon (gave bacon to the dog afterwards), used Mexican cheese, doubled sauce. For sauce, used Prego Italian Sausage & Garlic. Added 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning to meat as it browned. Added ½ the cheese mixture partway through, rest on top. Used turkey pepperoni (70% less fat) and used a little less than 1 container. 
My fiance and stepson enjoyed it but said that it could have been even spicier. I thought it was 100% perfect, but I don't like a lot of spice in my food. Next time I think I'll add some hot sauce or something.

I made this for my husbands work party. It was a hit! Very delicious and easy to make. I was concerned that the pound of sausage and the sauce wouldn't be enough, but it was perfect just as the recipe calls.

I rated this dish a 4 only because I didn't get to try it after I cooked it-I made it for another family. But I love the concept and given my experience with using this site and reading the other reviews, and just putting it together, I'm sure it turned out great. As someone suggested I used Ricotta instead of cottage cheese; I doubled the pepperoni and next time I'll double the olives.

Followed other reviews and doubled the sauce. Other than that, followed recipe exactly. It was great, and made enough for leftovers for tomorrow.  Who knew cottage cheese could taste this good in a casserole! Oh yeah, I did layer the noodles, cheese mixture, and pepperoni. It was delicious and very filling.

I made this almost as directed but used sausage/ground beef combination because it's what I had on hand.  I also added extra sauce because so many reviewers reported that it needed it.  Boy, am I glad I did...they were right...it would have been too dry without the extra sauce.  I also used only 16 oz. of cottage cheese, because that is what I had available.  It was enough, this dish is heavy with fat and calories, so any place to cut down on a few was welcomed by me.  Anyway, we loved it!  This will be made again and again in our house.

Recipe was good but have a few comments about it. I have no idea how you would ever fit it into a 9 x 13 pan. I used a large, deep casserole dish. I added mushrooms when I cooked the sausage.  I used a whole 23 oz. jar of sauce and I think it could have used a little more for the amount of noodles. I would cut back on the noodles if I made again. The recipe makes a lot!!

This was like magic in my mouth. My whole family loved this! My kids asked me what we were having for dinner the next day and I told them leftovers, they were super excited. They told me this was the best meal ever! I did add a little more sauce, 24 oz instead of 16 oz, sprinkled Parmesan over the top before baking and omitted the olives. Mushrooms would have been great but, my children do not like mushrooms.

Fairly easy to make, I replaced the Black Olives with Portebella mushrooms out of personal preference.  My wife thinks its a little bland, so I'm looking for ways to spice it up.  I'm thinking of threading some pepperoni into the sausage and sauce bit.

I tried this last night. I read the reviews & used ricotta cheese n a 20 oz jar of roasted garlic pasta sauce. That sauce was just enough. I layered the ricotta cheese & put the mozzarella cheese on top. Yummy!!!! Will definitely make again!

Pretty good. Tasted like a cross between pizza and lasagna. A few comments on what others posted about dry noodles, etc. I used a 24 oz can of "zesty" spaghetti sauce so flavor was good. I wouldn't say it was dry, but not overly juicy. However, because we have a vegetarian, I did make about an extra 2 oz (18 oz total) of pasta too. That way I could separate some out in her meatless version without shorting the pan for the rest of the family too much. Took longer to cook to get a nice brown color on top of cheese, but we are high altitude, had her extra small pan above it in the oven, and our oven seems to be acting up too. Was right amount of cheese (cottage cheese, etc.). My vegetarian daughter's I did end up slicing in half four of her veggie meatballs and putting those on top in place of the pepperoni. She loved it! Will make this again. Didn't really need any extra, but might experiment next time some peppers, onions, mushrooms, etc.

This recipe was delicious with a few minor adjustments. I used ricotta cheese (instead of cottage), mozzarella AND cheddar cheese. I also used a layer of the cheese mixture and pepperoni  in the middle. I will definitely make this again my family loved it!!!

I made this and substituted the sausage for ground beef ( no one in my house is a real big sausage fan) and the cottage cheese for ricotta (just because I always have it in the house).  This was outstanding! I had never thought of it before seeing it on here!  Thank you so much for sharing!

I made this tonight for dinner and it was a huge hit for everyone! I used whole wheat pasta, jennie-o italian turkey sausage and omitted the olives (we're not fans of olives). I also used a 29 oz can of pasta sauce because that's what I had. I served it with homemade garlic bread. I will definitely be making this again!

It was tasty. The cottage cheese a nice change for sure.  Sausage tends to be "weird" and I would suggest using Turkey meat and seasoning it. (not using turkey sausage)

I followed the recipe exactly and I think it was the tastiest thing I've ever made. My whole family loved it. I'm sure you can put other pizza toppings in with the same great results. It is very creamy and filling. I fed 5 people and we still have over half of it left so that is great for leftovers. This one is added to the menu here at home for sure!

Yum!  This recipe was so tasty!  We added Italian seasoning to the cottage cheese and I think next time we'll saute some chopped green pepper with the sausage.  Tasted like my fave pizza.  This makes a lot and it's very filling so I may freeze half next time.  Thanks for the post!

Very good! I made it for a family reunion and it was a hit. No leftovers, lol. To get kids to eat more vegetables use pasta suace with muchrooms in it, they'll never even relize it.

Really good recipe and a nice change from lasagna. This makes LOTS so would be great for a pot luck. There are only 2 of us so I had enough for 2 meals for us and sharing with friends and family with the rest so we would not get tired of it. The only thing I did was omit the olives since my hubby is not a fan.

I changed one major thing about this recipe and it still turned out EXTREMELY good! I was surprised. I took out the Italian sausage because I'm not big on a lot of meat. I don't eat regular spaghetti with meat. However, I love cheese and the mix of cottage and mozzarella was fantastic. Snaps to this recipe!

Good recipe!  I decided to make it a little lower in fat by using ground turkey and turkey pepperoni and lowfat cheeses and it still turned out very tasty.  I also opted for the mushrooms instead of olives.
