Really great and easy. I usually use red wine, but liked it very much with sherry for a change (not cooking sherry, buy a decent brand, then you can have some for yourself). The meat and the gravy is excellent!

Not bad, liked the simplicity but it needed help to make it a 5 star for me. Added fresh chopped mushrooms, onions, rosemary, thyme, lots of pepper, and worshesterchire to add flavor, also cooked some vegitables right in the crock second time around was good

Excellent roast beef recipe and SO easy. The only thing I did differently was quickly browned my chuck roast on all sides in a little olive oil before placing in crockpot.  Since we are mushrooms lovers, I sautéed some fresh mushrooms in the same pan and added them as well.

Absolutely simple & delicious!  Patted the chuck roast down with flour on both sides before placing it in the crockpot. This eliminated having to thicken the gravy at the end. Perfect!

We made this last night---and it was soooooooo good!! I added some more mushrooms to the mix (1 jar drained) and about an hour before serving, I added some diluted cornstarch to thicken the gravy. As sides we had garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed garlic green beans. We will certainly be making this again!

So heres the deal....I don't own a crock pot, because my hubby hates them he thinks the house is going to burn down and food comes out mushy.  So I had to improvise because the ingredients looked good.  I cooked at 350 for 2 hours in the oven with all ingredients and added fresh onion and garlic and used 1/2 of the onion soup mix as a rub.  What I will do differently is add the soup and broth 3/4 to half way through because my roast came out well done on the bottom and med rare on the top, which kind of worked out for us because he likes well done and I like rare.  We'll see next time, will definitely make again.

I cooked this recipe according to directions and it was divine. This recipe was a big hit with my husband who was so impressed he immediately posted a picture on his Facebook labeled "My Wife has outdone herself again". If he only knew how simple it was. Thanks for sharing. I will be making this again.

I made this exactly as the recipe described, but was short on time, so I cooked it on high for 4 hours and it turned out out GREAT!!  My oldest son actually huged me and thanked me.  He went back for a 3rd helping.  I added alittle cornstartch to the gravy and it was wonderful.  A definite keeper!

Super easy and delicious. I made this for myself and a friend and it was perfect. She couldn't stop complimenting it, and took all of the leftovers home. I did add some cornstarch to the gravy though.

Made this today--did not use Sherry (forgot to buy it).  Also used about a tsp. of corn starch to thicken after it had cooked.  Cooked it 8 hours on low, it was FANTASTIC!!! I was kind of nervous about making a roast but it was so easy.  This is one of my new favorite meals.

My hubby, son, and I all really loved it.  It is definitely going in our 'must make again' box!!

My family loved this recipe.  I followed it exactly, except I used dry white wine instead of sherry.  I served it with mashed potatoes and green beans.

This was amazing!  I made it today and my entire family loved it, which is not easy to do!  I prepared it without the Sherry, simply because I forgot to get some.  It was delicious and the gravy was so good.

I made the recipe exactly as and it turned out very good.  I put it on high the last hour and that thickened up the gravy.  Next time I am going to add carrots and canned mushrooms.

This is a full proof recipe.I had never made beef roast in the slow cooker until I tried this wonderful recipe for my Christmas day party. It was the first thing that disappeared from the table. The meat was so soft and flavourful. The only thing that I may try next time is to only add i can of mushroom soup instead of 2....I think it should be enough. Even my picky 7 year old daughter thought it was yummy!

AMAZING!!  Beef was so tender.  Gravy just needed a little thickening up and it was sooooo good!  Hubby said it was stew on a plate (I served with potatoes and carrots) and that was a good thing.  Thanks for the recipe.**update**Brother-in-law had leftovers.  Commented that this was the best gravy he'd ever had and I believe the word heaven was used :)

Fantastic! Loved by the kids and the grandparents. Made a LOT of gravy, so I might half that next time or re-use on a second roast. I used a 4 lb roast and browned it first, but otherwise followed exactly. As an alternative to mashed potatos, I served it with the roasted "Beets n Sweets" recipe on this site (with regular potatos added). The gravy meshed really well the roasted potatos and vegies. An absolute keeper!

The best! The meat comes out perfect and the gravy is amazing. Have tried to add potatoes/carrots/celery to the pot but have found this hinders how delicious the gravy is so I don't add any veggies directly to the pot anymore.

Thus recipe was kind of salty. I used low sodium soup but the gravy was still salty. If I make it again I will make the cream of mushroom soup myself. Over all the meat was great! My husband really liked it.

So yummy!  I have made this twice now- once without the Sherry because I didn't have any on hand and once with; my husband and I didn't notice a difference.  I served this with garlic mashed potatoes and brown sugar glazed carrots.  So easy!

made according the recipe (but with smaller roast - half the size) and adjusted other ingredients accordingly.  Gravy was delicious - next time will use a larger roast so we have more leftover!

After years of dry, tasteless roast beef I had almost given up before finding this recipe! It immediately became a family favorite! Such an easy, flavorful meal to make on days when we will be out for awhile! One of the first few times I made it i realized I only had a single can of cream of mushroom soup so i substituted a can of golden mushroom soup for the 2nd can. We liked it and have made it that way since. Both ways are great!

Easy to make and very good.  I made whipped potatoes to go with it.
Should cook 9 hours and not 8 hours.

Absolutely love this recipe!  My family loves it and my son begs for it when he’s on leave from the Army!  The only thing I add is a little thickening to the gravy.

Almost as good as my favorite restaurant  But excellent overall. Followed recipe to the tee.  Next time, will add some sour cream to the gravy just to see if it will be closer to my favorite restaurant.

This turned out just about perfect. I added baby red potatoes, carrots, pearl onions (frozen) and celery about 2.5 hours from the end.  Cooked for 10 hours.  I neglected to trim the excess fat off the exterior of the chuck roast. Next time I will, there's plenty of fat marbled throughout. Also just plain forgot the sherry.  Didn't miss it but will add it next time.  Will definitely make this again.

RIDICULOUSLY good and EASY! Only change I made was to dredge the roast in flour before adding to the crockpot and adding a spoonful of cornstarch to the gravy an hour before serving. Soooooo wonderful. My dad couldn’t get over how tender the meat was!

I (almost) made it as is.  I didn't have sherry so left that out, and added large chunks of Yukon Gold potatoes and carrots (~ 1.5 - 2" pieces) to the bottom of the crock because I love roasted root veggies and wanted to impart the roast flavor to them as well.  Otherwise I followed the recipe and it was very tasty!  The gravy was very flavorful and neither too thin or too thick.  Next time I will play with other seasonings and veggies to customize to my taste preferences.  It's a very good recipe to start with and then tweak it to make it your own.

Fantastic! I've never been a big fan or pot roast but this one is definitely a winner. To say it was fork tender would be a gross understatement. Served open face sandwich style with mashed potatoes just like Mom used to make...only better. ;)

This was one of my favorite dinners I've made. everything was great! I added a little bit of red wine in the gravy mixture. I also took the beef out of the Crock-Pot when it was finished and broiled it for 7 minutes just to crisp up the edges. I'll definitely be making it again!

I made this and  I hate when people change  the recipe and review it but I didn't have sherry and I did skip that.  It was delicious and perhaps the simplest main dish I've made.   I will make again and again.

The roast beef recipe I have been looking for!  Made exactly as directed but added fresh mushrooms the last hour because we LOVE mushrooms.  Served over egg noodles but would be great with potatoes and carrots too.  I don't think I'll ever make roast beef any other way.

I made exactly as directed.  It was quite tasty.  But if you like your beef anyway other than very well done, I would suggest one of the following.  Start with a frozen piece of beef or reduce the cooking time.  It was very flavorful and tender but also very well done.  Mine reached an internal temp of 191 F in 3.5 hours on low so I removed it from the crock pot at that point sliced it and we ate.  I use my crock pot at least once a week.  I do not usually have temperature issues with it.  The beef was 2.87 lbs. before cooking.  So my best suggestion is to be mindful of the cooking time because you will probably need to adjust it.  Otherwise it was very good and there were no leftovers !

It was good.  Loved the flavor, but I agree with some of the other reviews about adding extra items.  I put in fresh mushrooms, carrots and potato.  Next time I will add, garlic and some herbs.

Excellent way to roast a beef and have a great gravy ready at the same time! I do flour beef and braise it in a Ninja, then slow cook per recipe. I like to serve it with mashed potatoes, steamed green beans and cold apple sauce. This deserves ten stars, thank you so much for the recipe!

My husband, my son and I had this for supper.  WOW!!!  I used a beef blade roast and it just fell apart. First, I seared the roast in a frying pan.  After placing the roast in the slow cooker, I added a glass of water to the brownings and scraped them off off the pan.  I used the water and Brownings instead of regular beef broth.  I mixed the two cans of mushroom soup with two cans of water.  I then added the dry onion soup mix to the other soup and mixed it together..  I then poured the soup and browning mixes onto the roast.  I did not use sherry or wine or any substitutes for them.  Once I got the slow cooker warmed and the roast to start cooking, I added a small pinch of each Rosemary and thyme.  I will definitely make it again.

I used less of the onion soup mixture than requested in the recipe, and I seared the meat first and deglazed the pan with the beef broth for added flavor.  It was an easy and delicious.  I’ll be making this again soon.  Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic!  I used a Sirloin Tip Roast instead of Chuck roast, and the meat was falling apart.  Pair it with homemade mashed potatoes, and I'm looking forward to leftovers tonight!

I cooked this last night (in lieu of the stroganoff) and it came out WONDERFULLY! Even though I didn't have beef broth (just used water), the gravy was still #BOMBdotCom About an hour before it was done, I added stew veggies (carrots, potatos, celery, lima bean, pees, etc)

I was looking for a nice and easy beef and gravy recipe and had all of the ingredients on hand so decided to make this. I am not a fan of the soup mix packets since they're so salty, so I just made my own using a few simple ingredients. I added a handful of chopped mushrooms about halfway through cooking time. I halved the recipe. It did not need to cook on low the same amount of time. Probably about 6 hours. The gravy was a bit thin but the dish was altogether amazing! I was very happy with how delicious it turned out and how simple it was to throw together.

I like this but there's a fine line with the roast being over done.  I add mushrooms to the gravy too!

My husband and I enjoyed this. The flavor was great. I put this in the slow cooker on high for about 5 hours. I didn't think it was particularly tender. It certainly wasn't bad, but I expected so much more based on the other reviews.

This was great! Used red wine instead of Sherry and added mushrooms and carrots to the crock pot as well. Did put some cornstarch in the gravy at the end to thicken it up like some of the other folks, and it turned out just perfect!  Paired this with garlic mashed and we all loved it!

This was the BEST pot roast I have ever eaten!  I think the secret is that there is plenty of gravy, which keeps the meat moist.  It was falling apart after 8 hours, super tender!  I will definitely make this again.  The best part is that you can throw this together before you go to work, it's so easy.
