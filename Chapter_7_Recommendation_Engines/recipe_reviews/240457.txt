The deboning process took about half an hour but will go quicker next time.  The flavor is fine but this is all about the presentation so save this for when you have guests you want to impress.

I tried this recipe on a chicken first before the Christmas party that I'm hosting for my in - laws. The technique is complicated for us beginners but achievable. I'm giving 4 stars because it is a lot of work. The presentation made this recipe ok.

I knew when I watched the video I would have to try this.  I was a little nervous,  but the bone removal was easier and more straightforward than I expected.  I brined the turkey after the deboneing process. I used Sweetwater Spice Classic Holiday Turkey Bath. For my stuffing I used turkey stovetop with added onions and celery.  Stuffing the turkey was actually the hardest part for me. Chef John had much better control  of the floppy bonless turkey in the video . I had my wife help hold while I tied it.  Eventually we conquered the unruly fowl and got it trussed. I followed his temperature recommendations and the turkey came out perfect. It was exceptionally juicy and flavorful.  The stuffing and turkey exchanged quite a bit of flavors. This was everything I hoped it would be. I recommend this recipe for a different take on a classic Holiday favorite.

Though it took some time to de-bone the turkey, it was worth it. The entire turkey “roast” was moist and the after dinner clean up was a snap. I used the carcass to make turkey broth using Chef John’s Chicken broth recipe. Tomorrow, I will use some of the broth and leftover turkey to make Chef John’s Tom Kha Gai.  I LOVE his recipes!

Very impressive.  A lot of work, must be patient.  Kept returning to the video.  I will try it again.
