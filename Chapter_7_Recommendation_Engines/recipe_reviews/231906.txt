Really good with a few tweaks. Double the mushrooms andsherry. Use half and half instead of milk with two cups instead of three. Curious about beef broth in place of chicken.

This is a very easy soup with EXCELLENT results! I did make some minor changes due to personal taste and lack of availability of ingredients -- first, I used shallots instead of an onion (for their milder flavor), and I also used a mixture of different kinds of mushrooms - both of which worked out fine. Don't bring soup to a hard boil at any time, just follow instructions as they are.  After making the soup, I put it in a crockpot on Warm, then on LOW for a party that was several hours away - it kept the soup at a perfect temp and everyone LOVED it! Served it with snipped scallions to top it off and croutons which complimented it very nicely. Will definitely make this again!

I forgot to mention in my other review of this soup that I also tried adding a packet of Carolina wild rice with seasoning. It helped with the thickening and adding great flavor and texture!

The flavor of the mushrooms cooked in the sherry was amazing, but the broth left something to be desired.  A bit of rosemary finishing salt helped a lot.  I didn't puree it (just personal preference), but perhaps that would have improved the taste and texture of the broth.

Really good!  I did make two changes as we do not eat gluten or soy.  I used arrowroot powder as the thickener and homemade worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce.  I also did not puree it as we like chunky soups.  This recipe was super fast and really good.  Even my picky eater loved it!

This soup is Incredible!! 

I substituted wheat flour for buckwheat, and used goat milk yogurt instead of milk. I also used fresh sage and garnished with fresh chives.  The flavor is rich and yummy with the sherry.

My husband and I both loved this soup.  I divided the ingredients thinking it would make 4 servings but only made two bowls.  I used milk and Better Than Bouillon dissolved in water instead of liquid chicken broth.  I had to use a couple more tablespoons of flour for the soup to thicken.  I didn't puree any of the soup so all the mushrooms were sliced.  I will add this to our soup rotation during the winter months.  Marilyn
