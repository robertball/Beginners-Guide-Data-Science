I have made this many times now. It is wonderful as written!  But it also has the option to make changes to whatever you have on hand. I have used shredded pork, shredded chicken and ground beef. Varied my spices and cheeses. I have also used jarred spaghetti sauce.  Friends have loved it and requested the recipe. When I am at the grocery store and I see zucchini large enough to use I adjust my weekly menu to include these. Thank you for sharing the recipe!!!

Couldn't quite get the ravioli wrapped correctly, so I made it layered like lasagna instead!  Worked just as well.

I've made ravioli several times using zucchini instead of pasta.  Same great flavor, far fewer carbs.  As stated, mix and match fillings to suit your taste preferences.  These will continue to be in the regular meal rotation.
