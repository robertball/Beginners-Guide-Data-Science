Very good recipe - I should have doubled it! I used margarine instead of shortening (just make sure it's cold when you put it in), only 1/2 cup of coconut (perfect amount - 2 cups would have been WAY too much), and I used Southern Comfort for the bourbon. Turned out great! We enjoyed it topped with vanilla ice cream.

The crust was flat tasting and I came out almost gooey.  Too much shortning!  I used brown sugar (IMHO, bourbon and brown sugar are a taste combo made in Heaven!) and sweetened coconut, but they weren't quite sweet enough to make up for the flat tasting crust.  The bourbon added a great little accent to the overall flavor though.  I'm giving it two stars only because I can see the potential if I were to add powdered sugar to the crust and use butter instead of shortning (omitting the salt if using salted butter).  
I'll probably make it again but I'll tweak the recipe.

Did we forget to add cold water to the crust part of this recipe. Even at that, the crust was flat tasting. I can't say this is Pecan Bars, I would call them Coconut Bars with chpped nuts. Too much coconut, the more you chewed, the bigger mouthful you had. Not my favorite. Sorry!
