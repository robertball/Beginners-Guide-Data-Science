This was good! I was searching around for a salad recipe to use up half an avocado left in the fridge and found this...I did follow Naples advice in spicing up the dressing as it is quite bland on it's own (I added a few shakes of spicy taco seasoning mix), as I had no lime juice on hand, I used red wine vinegar...fast and easy to prepare and it certainly hit the spot! Thank's for the recipe Hellman's! (BTW - the BEST mayo EVER!) ;)

As this recipe's first reviewer I followed the recipe to the letter - at first.  What started out being not very good, I'm afraid to say, ended up being one of the best salads I've had in a long time. My issue is with the dressing.  I made it as written, but after tasting it I knew I would not be happy with it...at...all.  It was way too thin and, between the mayo and all that lime juice, much too tangy.  I had to doctor it up.  Adding sour cream solved both problems, thickening it as well as mellowing it out.  But I found that were it not for its tanginess there really was not much flavor at all.  Cumin, cilantro (I only had dried on hand), salt and pepper, to the rescue!  (Some taco seasoning would have done the trick too)  This salad with those few changes in the dressing was awesome good.  The ingredients were obviously carefully chosen to come up with the perfect combination of contrasts in flavors and textures - creamy, mellow, crunchy, colorful and flavorful.  Genius.  Sheer genius. One thing is the perfect counterpoint to another.  The pepper jack cheese, for instance, is the perfect complement to the subtle flavor of the avocado.  I added leftover roast chicken simply to make this a complete main dish salad but I wouldn't necessarily say it was an improvement on something that was already perfect.   As written, however, with a dressing with merely an acidic tang, I wouldn't even have recognized this as the same salad.

This was a fabulous salad.  I made sure to drain my salsa and added a spoonful of sour cream (per other reviews) to the dressing.  It wasn't soggy at all. I used corn chips for the top.  This was a gorgeous salad and would be great for a summer potluck.

What a delightful salad!  The flavors were wonderful although I did have to work on the dressing a bit.  I would advise anyone making this salad to drain the salsa for the dressing, as the dressing comes out quite thin.  The flavor just wasn’t quite right so, after sifting through the other reviews, I added light sour cream (if you can get Daisy Brand in your area, their light sour cream is wonderful and almost indistinguishable from regular sour cream) and taco seasoning.  A sit of several hours in the fridge made a huge difference in the dressing so I highly recommend making the dressing early in the day or even the night before serving the salad.  I used Trader Joe’s organic super sweet corn and sweet grape tomatoes that I halved.  The slightly salty corn chip topping was the perfect complement to the other flavors; I almost skipped them and I am very glad that I did not.  As written, this is a 4 star salad, but I am giving it a 5 star rating so that others will give it a try and not miss out on a unique, delicious, and attractive salad.

We really enjoyed this.  I used half mayo half sour cream, just personal preference.  All mayo would have been good too.  I did not use the lime juice just b/c I used a good salsa, the kind that needs refrigerated, so it had a lot of great fresh flavors already and didn't need the extra lime juice.  I mis-read the ingredients and used fritos not tortilla chips but I think I would do that again b/c they were gooood with it!

Good- I think the dressing benefited from a spoonful of sour cream and a dash of taco seasoning.  This was a very pretty salad.

Good, but not quite enough flavor.  I ended up adding some seasonings and extra cheese to punch it up a bit.

Like some of the other reviewers, I found the dressing to be initially too thin. The addition of a 1/4 cup or so of sour cream thickened it up a little.  I also made the dressing about 8 hours in advance so that it would have time to thicken in the fridge. This salad was absolutely delicious!

delicious, everyone loved,  i thought there was going to be too little dressing, but it was the perfect amount. I actually forgot to put the tortilla chips on and it wasn't missed but next time I will remember them.

Pretty good! I used light mayo and a little less cheese than the recipe calls for(only because we are trying to eat a little healthier). Other than that no changes. Thanks for a yummy recipe! Elvira Silva.
