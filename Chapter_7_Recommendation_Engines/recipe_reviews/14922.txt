Not impressed at all.  Served it as an appetizer over Thanksgiving weekend and again for Monday night football.  Thought it might be just too much food to choose from during Thanksgiving, but both times, 3/4's of this recipe sat while everything else was devoured.

Tasted too "mayonaissey" to me.  Would be better to thin the cream cheese with just the salsa, and leave out the mayonnaise.  One tip that makes the tortillas easier to roll is to heat each tortilla in the microwave for 30 seconds before spreading filling.  It softens them up and makes it easier to roll them tight.  (Out-of-the-fridge, stiff tortillas leave a hole in the center when you roll them.)

Awesome! I, too, changed the recipe some. I used green chilis rather than green olives and I added a bit of minced garlic and just enough cayenne pepper to give it a tiny bite. I tripled the recipe and took them to the tavern we own for an appetizer. Even the guys were asking for the recipe! It was nice because I could pull them out of the fridge and slice them for serving as I needed them. I thought the longer they were in the fridge, the better they tasted. Habit forming! I will definitely use this recipe a lot.

I really have no complaint about the recipe, as submitted.  However,  I was happily able to reduce calories from 428, per serving, to 183.5.  And, reduced sodium content from 900mg to 192mg, per serving.  [I substituted sour cream for the mayonnaise.  I omitted the green olives and substituted 1/2 cup chopped red and/or green bell pepper.]

This recipe is very easy and is sure to please! The recipe calls for eight 10" tortillas--when I made it, I spread the filling just thick enough to cover each tortilla, yet the mixture only covered four tortillas. So if you really need to make eight tortillas' worth, you might consider making a larger batch. I made the filling a day in advance and refrigerated it overnight to allow the flavors to blend--yummy!--then softened it in the microwave for 4 minutes at 20% power.

I brought these to work today.  They were gone  in less than 30 min!  I omitted the mayo and added salsa and shredded cheese.  Great!  Next time I'll double the recipe.

I made these to take to a party and most everyone enjoyed them.  They make a very pretty presentation if you add chopped parsley, and slice them on the diagonal.  Depending on your taste, you can omit different ingredients; I have never used olives and they still turn out great. You can also use different flavors of tortillas; spinach (green) and tomato (red) would look festive for Christmas! UPDATE: I continue to take this appetizer to parties and ALWAYS receive compliments. It is just so easy, tasty, and pretty. Serve with salsa and you have a great appy.

This is a recipe that you can easily alter to suit your tastes. I omitted the black olives but added a small can of green chile peppers, 1/4c diced red peppers and 3-blend taco cheese (and a little more of it). Tasty without dipping in salsa! HMMMM good!

this is a great base recipe. You can add a shake or two of garlic powder and some cilantro for a nice zesty taste and seven serve it as a dip for crackers (hearty ones...the ritz type crumble too easy.)).... NOTE: for ease in spreading microwave the cream cheese before adding ingred. for about 20-45 seconds.

Like others, I am not fond of green olives so left them out.  I made this with green chiles and pimentos for color.  My friends and co-workers really enjoy these.  They go fast!!

I doubled this recipe as I was making this for a potluck at work. I did change a couple of things with this recipe. I used light cream cheese and light mayo and I also added a little light sour cream. To this mixture I added a packet of mild taco seasoning for some kick. I omitted the green olives and just used the green onions and black olives. I rolled these up in spinach tortillas for added effect and it was a hit. I served it with mild salsa. I can't wait to make this again.

Very good!  I made the following changes: doubled the cream cheese and added 1/2 cup sour cream to the mayo mixture (everyone seemed to say that it did not make 8 roll ups).  And I added finely chopped scallions, diced green chilis, a dash of tabasco sauce and about 1/4 cup grated mexican cheese.  Made the mixture the day before to allow flavors to blend and then refrigerated the roll-ups before cutting into pieces.  Everyone LOVED them and asked for the recipe.  Will definately make again!

I've been making these for years, they are a delicious appetizer, easy and fun to make. I add a few drops of hot sauce and about 1 tsp. horseradish to the filling to perk it up, then don't bother with the salsa for dipping. Not so messy for your guests, as finger food goes. These can be made ahead so it's great when preparing for company or taking to a party. I think the green olives make it too salty so I use chopped green pepper in place of the green olives.

One of the best recipes ever!  Everybody loves these rollups.  I usually use different colored tortillas and fill one color with filling without olives and the other with olives.  I usually add about 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder to give it a bit of a lift. 

Awesome recipe!!  And they look beautiful.

A perfect recipe. Very easy, very fancy looking, very pretty, very tasty. Very moist but not sloppy. Excellent “portable” food for company parties. I used the green olives with pimentos for a little extra color. Put them in the freezer for about 40 minutes to firm them up fast. Use a sharp knife too. They taste best after they come to room temperature. It brings out the creaminess of the cream cheese. But they warm up fast even if you refrigerate them until serving. Spread filling thicker like others said. I only had 4 - 8” tortillas so I had to and they were just right.  (Only needed to serve 4 people.)  My only petty complaint was that the outer tortilla layers start to get a bit dried out after sitting out in the air for awhile but the creamy filling is still so good you hardly notice anyway. The salsa dip helps disguise this problem too. I suppose you might keep that in mind if you were serving high royalty or something. Don’t count on any leftovers. Will make again!!!

This is a good recipe...but. I would double the filling ingredients and spread a bit thicker! I added fresh cilantro and minced jalepeno and had rave reviews. Still I would have like a better amount of filling...and be careful to spread on the entire tortilla!!

Great recipe- Thank you!  I brought these appetizers to a "Mexican Fiesta", and they got eaten up! You've got to make this for a party!  It's very tasty, and relatively easy. I added 1 stalk chopped celery, pomento stuffed olives instead of regular(for color), and 1 minced clove of garlic.  They tasted awesome!  I only used 7 tortillas-spread pretty thin. Make sure to roll tightly and gently. The recipe makes A LOT!  Several people wanted the recipe.

So simple to make!  Always a hit!  I exclude the green olives and add more green onion.  These are addictive.  They are gone fast at every party! Just a tip--spread it thin.  You should have enough to go through a whole package of wrappers.  I was nervous about spreading it so thin at first, but because you roll it up each bite still has lots of flavor.  Thanks for this recipe!

I made this recipe for the first time and it was delicious. It is perfect for warmer weather parties because it requires no heating, and because the rollups are chilled (preferably overnight) they are still cold when the last one is gobbled up. I took the advice of other reviewers and omitted the green olives. I also added taco seasoning and roasted red peppers. That is the beauty of these rollups...add whatever you think your friends/family would like. And they display very nicely arranged around a bowl of salsa for dipping. The recipe makes a decent amount - just enough for everyone to get their addition filled without overindulging before the main meal. Thanks for the easy and tasty recipe!

I've also made this recipe for years. It was my first AllRecipe dish. I lay down scallions and red peppers alternately before rolling. Also, adding a good bit of cumin gives them a nice 'mexican' flavor. They always disappear!

These were delicious!! The other reviews were helpful, I also added some taco seasoning and cayenne pepper. I needed two 8oz tubs of whipped cream cheese in order to spread on 8 warm tortilla shells. I also added one can of refried beans to the cream cheese mixture. The roll-ups were all gone in about twenty minutes of putting them out! This recipe is a keeper!! Thanks

This is a good base recipe, but I made several modifications so they would taste more Mexican.   I substituted sour cream for the mayo and used mild canned green chiles rather than green olives.  I also added cilantro, garlic and chili pepper pastes (I just bought the small package of "Mexican" spice pastes in the produce section).  With these changes I received some compliments, I took them to a Mexican fiesta at work.  I bought the large burrito size tortillas but these still seemed like they came out a bit smaller than what I was expecting.

This was really good!  and a nice change of pace from the usual dips.  I, however, do not like olives so I used diced jalapeno peppers and diced (small and drained) tomatoes and served it with salsa for dipping.  Guess i changed the recipe a lot but WOW!!  these are great and I guess you could easily fill them to suit your tastes!  Thanks so much for a great tailgate recipe!

I thought these were really bland.  I made them for a spanish class that I was teaching and I had a lot left over . . . not a big hit.

This was so easy. I did take advise from the other reviews. I did not use green olives or mayo. I substituted sour cream. I also added taco seasoning...it was perfect!

I really thought this recipe was great, although I changed it up a bit.  I added one large can of chopped black olives and diced red pepper for color.  I also added a bit of taco seasoning to the mix.  This really added an extra kick.  I just served this at a baby shower and it was quite a hit!

I love black olives but am I not fond of green ones but it's an absolute must here when it comes to flavour!  I chopped the olives finely (practically minced them) and put the cream cheese (low fat) in the microwave for a little bit to make it easier to spread.  Next time I'll spread it on a little thicker.  The salsa pairing wasn't necessary, as the rollups went faster than the salsa did. Great simple recipe.

Very tasty, a good and easy appetizer. Made it this am and took it to a pool party, went over well. I followed some reviewers suggestions and made a few changes: 
Instead of green olives, I used a can of diced green chillies, I added a dash of garlic powder, tossed in a little Mexican blend shredded cheese, and a few TBS of salsa. It was delish! I'll be making this again, thanks for the recipe!

I've made these for several occasions now, and they always seem to be a big hit. Easy to make, and the only negative thing I've heard about them is that they disappear too quickly.

Yum Yum.  These were a hit.  I didn't add quite as many green olives, and I exchanged the mayo with sour cream.  I might have added a couple of pepperocinis also.  I tripled the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I made the recipe as is and agree with most others that the olives were too overpowering. My rating is based on the recipe as-is. I made it again with no mayo or green olives and added fresh salsa (in the cream cheese) and mexican spices. Will definitely make again. It's perfect for a potluck type of affair.

I absolutely love these!  I've been making them for years with a few modifications - I don't use mayonnaise - I used sour cream instead. Also, I dice up roasted red peppers and add 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese.  These are always a huge crowd pleaser!

This is good when you follow the recipe, but when I made it a second time it was even better. Here were my changes: added more olives and let the sliced roll ups chill in the refrigerator for 6 hours. The flavors mixed in better and the tortillas became even softer.

Although people at the party liked them, it was not at all what I was expecting.  I found it a little bland and had too much of a mayo flavor.  (I don't like mayo.)  Also, all the beautiful colors from the individual ingredients just got muddy after mixing them.  I was very disappointed.  It just didn't look nice anymore.  Maybe spreading the cream cheese and then sprinkling the ingredients on it before rolling will help.  I'll keep my eye out in the reviews to see what others may have done.

My husband made these and we thought that they were okay but a little too bland.  He then made a second batch and added Chili sauce, cilantro and Mexican cheese.  That did the trick and gave it the kick it was missing.

Wonderful recipe.  Easy and very tasty. Definately will make again and again. Do NOT substitute corn tortilla - they're too hard and break.  Only use flour tortillas as the receipe states.

These were a great idea! I did change the recipe up because I don't eat green olives and I wanted something a little more spicy for Cinco de Mayo. I substituted chopped green chilies for a little more spice, used jalapeno wraps, substituted sour cream for the mayo and used a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and crushed garlic. They were delicious!

Yummy little things!  A bit harder to make than I was expecting...there was a lot of tortilla tearing, but worth it!  The longer they are refrigerated, the soggier they become, so I wouldn't make them too far in advance.

I'm giving this two stars because one person out of 20 who tried it, liked it. I saved this recipe a long time ago and couldnt wait for New Years Eve to give it a try. Boy was I dissapointed. The only change I made to the recipe was to put in half the amount of green onions because 6 is just seemed to be a lot. As it turned out, even 3 made it too oniony (is that a word?). Nobody looked forward to eating this more than me. I'm sorry it didnt taste as good as it sounded.

I didn't make ANY changes so I am rating the recipe not my creativity.  I like olives but this was really olive flavored.  I had to bring these to a party so I made them the night before to sit. The mixture tasted pretty good originally but after sitting overnight the olives took over.

These were fantastic. I doubled the cream cheese, added some taco seasoning and a little sour cream.  We love olives, just chop them real fine and adjust the amount to taste. Great recipe!

This has become a party staple for me.  They're easy, delicious, and they look great!  I usually add about a tsp. of garlic powder.  I also do 2 batches - one with black olives and one without for those who aren't fussy about them.  Everybody always raves about these.

Brought them to a Christmas family get together. They all couldn't stop asking about them . They were certainly a hit at this party.I took the advice of one reader, added cumin and spicy refried beans. I made some spicy and some mild.  I was so happy to introduce them to my favorite recipe site at the same time. These are a keeper alright!!

Very good!  I used half the the mayo called for, and added the salsa right to the mix.  I have made them without mayo too, and they turn out great.  I like them better without black olives though.

These were edible, but were bland. No one at the party mentioned them to me and I took the majority of them back home with me. They're pretty, though!

I have been making this recipe for years & everyone loves them!  You can omit the mayo & just use cream cheese.  Sometimes I kick it up with garden vegetable flavored cream cheese and a pinch of garlic powder.  We also add a small can of chopped mushrooms.  Yummy!!!  This mixture is also good for stuffing pickled jalapenos too!

I did not like this at all!!  I don't particularly like olives, but other posts said that if you don't like olives you should still like this.  I found the olive taste overpowering (and I didn't even use all of the recommended olive quantities).  It tasted VERY salty.  I made them for a party, but didn't feel like they were good enough to bring.  I did however use anothe recipe form this site and made wraps that contained:  cream cheese, salsa, jalapeno peppers, and green onion.  Everyone LOVED these and they were gone very quickly.  If only I made a double batch instead of wasting the ingredients on this recipe.  So, beware:  if you son't like olives, you won't like this recipe!!!

A HIT! Everyone really enjoyed this tasty recipe. I used half the recommended amounts of olives, and the additional salsa wasn't necessary. Definitely a winner.

This wasn't great.  I was hoping for something with a little more ZING to it.  The black olives overwhelmed the flavor.  It makes a nice presentation but lacks where it counts...great taste!

i used black olives only, and sliced turkey lunch meat (with cream cheese mixture spread before the turkey and just a lil on top to make sure the toppings stuck) and doubled the cream cheese mixture as other reviews said.  Served them for a different lunch for hubby and he loved them!  Ppl at work asked where he BOUGHT them!

I took these to a potluck at work, and people asked me for the recipe. One of my coworkers actually told me that these were the best 'tortilla spirals' she'd ever had. 
Wow! No one has ever given me a compliment on my cooking like that before.
I took the advice of other reviewers and added 4-blend shredded Mexican cheese, as well as a healthy dollop of salsa. 
These even worked out well at a bridal shower.

THESE WERE A LITTLE BIT SALTY BUT VERY GOOD. THE NEXT TIME I WILL TRY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF GREEN OLIVES AND INCREASING THE BLACK OLIVES. THIS A GOOD RECIPE TO MAKE A DAY AHEAD. SAVES A LOT OF TIME. VERY EASY.

I made these for New Year's and they turned out pretty good.  It was a touch too much onion for my taste.  I will reduce the amount of onion next time.  Other than that, great recipe.

I am almost embarrassed when people ask me for the recipe for this (and they always do!).  They are so simple to make. So far I haven't found anyone that doesn't like them, and I have made these probably 6-8 times over the past year.  I don't use as many tortillas, since otherwise the layer of filling is thin.  As others have said, this is easily customizable to suit your own tastes.

This is great. I was slightly unsure about the green olives, thinking they might overpower the recipe, but I followed  the directions exactly and the rollups came out wonderful. I took these to a get-together and they were a hit.

I've been making these for years. To fill 10 tortillas, you need 2 8 oz. pkg. cream chese (neuchatel works just as well and cuts down on fat) For those who want some kick - use chopped jalapenos (canned are fine) instead of the green olives. Put in as much as your taste buds and guests want.

This was only ok.... used green chilies, and added a few tablespoons taco seasoning, but was still not "very lively" according to my boyfriend. We served this with a super delicious homemade salsa, but it didn't  help too much. He said tortilla chips would have been better. He also mentioned adding some jalapenos might have helped. Thanks anyway...

these were pretty good. i omitted the olives for personal preference.  however i think the measurements are a little off - i only had 4 tortillas worth of filling.  i realize i didn't use olives but i dont think that took away half the volume of filling.  all in all though they were super easy to make and everyone seemed to enjoy them.

This was ok-- nothing that knocked my socks off... I was expecting a bit more flavor, but we found the tortillas really dominated. They might be good for kids, or really picky eaters. I'll be working off this basic recipe but adding many more things to spice them up in the future just for our tastes. Thanks for sharing!!

I made this with 4oz of fat free cream cheese 4 oz of lowfat cream cheese. I also used lowfat mayo, no olives and I added a half of a can of green chiles and diced up tons of jalapenos. I also used lowfat whole wheat tortillas. This was a hit, I had to package up a bag for our guests (made way too many for how many people we had coming) And spicey stuff for me being pregnant doesnt mix so I needed to get rid of them.

Didn't seem like they were turning out right when I was rolling them but after I chilled them they cut up perfectly. I did sub green chilies for the green olives as I don't personally care for green olives but otherwise followed it to a tee. Exactly the recipes that I was hoping it was.

These are very good althought I add 8 oz. shredded cheddar or Mexican blend cheese to the cream cheese mixture.  I like to use sun-dried tomato tortillas and spinach tortillas to give them a pretty color.

I have taken these to parties and just to eat at home. I could eat the whole batch by myself! They have gone over very well with everyone. I do agree with what a few other reviewers said--you do need to like olives and salty foods to enjoy these. I only make a couple of changes. I use spinach tortillas and a light veggie cream cheese. Delicious!

These were a hit!  I was a little apprehensive they would taste like mayo, but I really couldn't taste it at all.  I added somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar, and they were great!

Sorry, but I didn't like these much. When my brother, who is a teenager and has a bottomless pit for a stomach, refused to have a second rollup (and he's not picky about his food), I knew this wouldn't be a success in my family. I'm giving it two stars only because my dad seemed to like the filling (but not the whole rollup). I'll keep looking for another recipe like this. Thanks.

These got a lot of compliments and I think they have potential. I would definately use more olives next time, as well as more salsa. They could also use something else but I'm not sure what...

I put just the dip in the fridge to set while I sauteed some chicken.  I spread the dip on tortillas before adding the chicken and guacamole.  It was a good mixture but there were too many green olives for me.  Too salty.  But a good recipe!

These were great tasting! Took them to a New Year's Eve party, and everyone kept asking who had made these and asked for the recipe. Came home with an empty plate.  The only thing I would change is doubling the amount of filling for 8 tortilla shells. It just didn't seem like I ended up with a lot of filling for each shell. Next time I will try doing that, other than that, wonderful!!!

I have made this twice and everyone loves it!  I use a little less olives because it can get very salty.  It is best if you make the filling and allow it to sit in the fridge for a days.  It is even better if you let the rolls (once made)sit in the fridge for a few hours to a day.

This was a great and easy recipe! we used miracle whip and mayo because we ran out mayo. We did not find the flavor of the mayo overwhelming at all, but I'm not sure if it was because the two were mixed. Overall it was a tasty and easy recipe that was enjoyed by all. We will be using this recipe again for our holiday appetizers.

I have made that recipe many times and it has always been a hit. As mentionned by others, you will cover only about four tortillas with the mixture. You can easily prepare it in advance and slice it at the time of serving. I usually cut the amount of green onions to three otherwise the onion taste is overpowering, especially if you prepare it in advance. Thanks for this so easy and so good recipe!

i was really disappointed with this recipe.  i brought these to a party and they did not go over well.  i personally thought the green olives had too strong of a flavor, which i found very overpowering.  i think they would have been quite good if it wasn't for the green olives, therefore, if i make these again, i will definitely leave out the green olives.

These were a big hit when I made them for company.  They were very easy and tasted delicious.  A couple of people asked me for the recipe.  I used tomato tortillas and the contrast in color between the spread and the tortillas made it attractive as well.  Thanks!

AWESOME! And I don't even really like olives! With school underway, I needed to find some new recipes to pack for my lunches. So I tried this, and was not disappointed. They were easy to make, very satisfying, healthier than cafeteria food and SO much better than the ever-so-boring crackers and cheese! Carefully scaling down the recipe for one person was a waste, 'cause both my sister and my mom insisted on having it for their lunches too! Thanks!

This was an excellent appetizer! It was quick and easy to make and saved me lots of time.  The only problem I had, was it didn't make as many as the recipe called for, so I doubled mine.

I love this recipe.  I made these for a bridal shower and they were gone in a flash.  I did leave out the green olives and just went with the black, but they were still so tasty.

These are really very good, although the only reason I guess they are called "Mexican" roll-ups is because you can dip them in salsa.  I made these for a New Year's Eve party and added some chopped ham.  They were a hit, although no one dipped them in the salsa!

This is a good recipe as is. I wanted a little more flavor to the cream cheese/mayo spread, so I left out the mayo and mixed a half can of chili without beans into the cream cheese. Yummy!

I made a platter of these for my employee party.  These rollups were very easy to make.  I was, however, rather concerned that the taste of mayo was too overpowering. But, I was assured by everyone, and the empty platter I brought home, that they were wonderful.  Months later I am still asked how to make them.  I think I chose a winner.

this was pretty good, and i dont even like olives. made it for my sister's birthday and everyone said they were great but didn't really grab them up. :/ the salsa for dipping is a necessity. and make sure you get the 10" flour tortillas, theyre better quality than the smaller ones for whatever reason (talking about Goya brand)

This recipe is great - I use it or variations of it for most every party and it is gobbled up immediately.

if you just use one 8 oz thing of cream cheese it is to much mayo. I had to put in 4 more oz. I also added garlic salt and green chilis.

This was a delicious and easy recipe. It took me almost no time to make (I put my roll-ups in the freezer to set up). I served this for a Tupperware party and there were ZERO left.

Did not really like this at all. Made it for a party as a finger food and was not a crowd pleaser. Olives made it salty and salsa just couldn't save it either... Will not make it again, however idea was great, but if I ever attempt to make this again, not with Olives though!

I gave it a 3 as-is, it didn't seem very "mexican" at all. So I substituted fiesta ranch dip for the mayo, halved the cream cheese, and added peppers. Made a huge difference!

I don't like olives and the combination of mayo and cream cheese didn't sound too good.  I took the basic idea, changed it a little and it was a huge hit.  I eliminated the olives and salsa then  substituted 8 oz of sour cream for the mayo.  I added some leftover BBQ chicken and about 6 green onions.  Also used some garlic salt.   These were delicious!   Kids loved them and so did the adults.  I did use a spinach tortilla which worked great.  I gave this recipe 4 stars because I changed it significantly.

Unfortunately I really didn't like these too much.  I just didn't think the flavors came together well.  I was hoping to make them for an upcoming party but think I'll have to keep searching for something else.

I make this all the time and everyone always love this. I do change it a bit, no black olives. I put hot salsa in to make it extra spicy, plus I get flavor tortillas, like Chipotle to add more flavor. I wait to spread it on the tortillas until they are ready to be served. So good!

Very delicious. Easy to personalize also... I left out the green olives.  I used cheddar jalapeno tortillas.  Quick and easy.  I made them the night before and sliced right before serving.

I make this same recipe, but with a few additions... I fry up 1 lb. of taco meat, season. I also add salsa to the mayo and cream cheese to give it more spice. I wrap with plastic wrap and let sit in the fridge overnight. I never have leftovers with this recipe!

These were okay.  There were too many olives for my families tastes and probably would have benefited from some cheddar and bacon in the mixture.

I made these for a party I had, and I must admit I was a little worried about the amount of olives, because I thought it might be too much for most people.  WRONG!  These were the first thing eaten, and everyone (including me) LOVED them.  This recipe has gone into my permanent recipe collection, and I plan to make it many more times!

These were pretty easy to make and very yummy! Took a little under 20 mins from start to finish. I was skeptical that they would tast mexican, but they really do! I added some taco seasoning to the creamcheese mixture. I alternated between a rollup with turkey and without. I preferred without the turkey. Definitely will make again, good party appetizer!

These were SO good!  No one could have just one!  I added a bit of cilantro and cumin to the cream cheese base.  I think I might add a little bit of shredded cheddar next time.  So easy...and delicious!

These were not a hit at our house, perhaps because I used low carb tortillas which were thinner than regular.  They got soggy very quickly, and the taste was just ok.  I cut back on the mayo and added a little salsa to the cream cheese mixture for a little added umph, but they were left on the platter.  Unlike other reviewers, I think you do need to be an olive fan to enjoy these.

The Tortilla Rollups II on this site are better & quicker to make. However...I made this for an appetizer w/Chili. They were a HUGE hit...Everyone loved them. So far I have been very lucky w/every recipe from this site! Y-U-M-M-Y!SUPER EASY & QUICK to make.

8.8.03  Your typical pinwheels...nothing too special, but I subbed chilis instead of green olives...maybe that will make the difference...meanwhile - still looking for that spectacular pinwheel concoction.

I liked these.  I did make 2 changes to the recipe though.  I substituted chopped green chiles for the green olives and I reduced the green onion to 2 or less.  If you like these, try the "Puffs" by Rebecca Swift too.

Great recipe and so easy to make. Can be rolled up ahead of time and refrigerated and cut up just before serving. I've made this on many occasions and have been asked for the recipe each time. People can't believe it's so simple to make. The only change I make is to add finely chopped fresh green chilis to spice it up. I will definitely make this recipe over and over again.

I made this for my staff's Christmas lunch yesterday.  Of the 15 appetizer's brought, this is the only one that was completely gone by the end of the day.  Skipped the olives but added green chiles, cheddar cheese and salsa to the mixture.  Used a non-fat spinach and feta cream cheese which completely enhanced the flavour!  Quick and easy to make!

Very fast and very easy.  I omitted the green olives due to taste preference.  Most of my family ate the roll-ups without dipping them in the salsa.

Really good but I found the green olives were a bit strong.  Took a little getting used to.  Also, I was able to cover only 1/2 of the tortillas suggested in the recipe.  Will make again though.

I added black olives and no green olives. I used lowfat cream cheese and lowfat mayo.  I spiced it up with ceyanne pepper. The kids and my husband loved them, though they are very filling so I froze 3 rolls (unsliced) and will use them at a later time.

Crowd pleaser, I would use pimento instead of green olives, and a dash of dill on each tortilla before you wrap.
Many different ways to prepare depending on  your crowd!

I didn't read the full directions before I started mixing things together and  accidentally added the 1/2 cup salsa to the cream cheese mixture rather than use it as a dip.  I also love olives so I was generous with the measurement of both black and green olives.   It was a bit soft with the salsa mixed in but the flavor was great.  It got a thumbs-up from my co-workers.   If you don't like olives, chances are you won't like this recipe much.

I used this as a base recipe and incorporated/ omitted ingredients based on what I had on hand. Loved it!! After reading other reviews, I made it as follows: 2- 8 oz packages Neufchatel Cheese (which is 1/3 less fat cream cheese), 1/3 C Miracle Whip (for sweetness), 1/2 jar prepared mild salsa, 3 scallions, 12 chopped Kalamata olives, 1/3 chopped green pepper, 1/3 chopped red bell pepper (squeeze to release juice before adding to the mixing bowl), generous shakes of garlic powder and onion powder, scant amount dried oregano, generous shakes of dried parsely, 5-6 splashes Frank's Red Hot, zest of 1/2 small lemon. I used Boghosian Valley Bread brand tomato & basil wraps instead of tortillas (which I find a little gummy in texture when uncooked). These wraps have a fairly healthy ingredient list, have good flavor, a pliable, slightly chewy texture and are very large. They are good cooked or uncooked. Loved these apps. as I made them-

The only thing mexican about these is the tortillas and the salsa which do not add enough flavor to tip the scales in that direction. Otherwise the olives overpowered the general flavor and this turned out to be not very tasty at all. I brought them to a birthday party and everyone only had one or two.

Nothing special. I made these for a Mexican themed party and they were hardly touched. Follow others advice and add some spice to them. Otherwise they taste like cream cheese rolled up in a tortilla.

I also changed the recipe. Left out the green Olives, added Sour Cream instead of Mayo. added finely shredded cheddar and finely chopped green Onions before rolling them up.  Have also made this dish and substituted Sliced Boiled Ham for the Tortilla; were a great hit at several parties.

These were very good and a hit at the party I took them too.  I used green chilies instead of green olives and I added a little taco seasoning to the cream cheese mixture.  Also I made these with jalapeno chedder tortilla's and they were delicious!

Made these for a party and they didn't go over well. The tortilla was to moist. I followed the recipe as written.

For some odd reason my spread came out very, very runny... it might have been my salsa I'm not sure. I also thought though it was a little bland. Because of those two things I ended up adding drained canned black beans and corn as well as some cilantro and just serving it with tortilla chips. I will have to try again, but in the mean time thanks for the base!!

I love this quick and easy recipe.  I did use less mayo, about 1/4 cup.  I 86ed the green olives and only used 3-4 green onions.  I don't like a lot of spice but a good pinch of cayenne gave great flavor.  The mixture is definitely better after it sits.  I refridgerate it over night before I spread it on the the tortillas.  Yummy!

I followed this recipe exactly except I used a little less olives. The cream cheese base I found to be very good but the green olives really overpowered everthing. I will defintley use again and probably try with the diced chiles like a lot of others did and just omit the olives.

Wow!  Made these for Christmas and they were a pretty big hit.  Easy to make, got a lot of compliments on them, and even more when they remembered to dip in Salsa.  I'll totally make these again sometime.

These were maybe too olive-y for me. Still a very good recipe, but I think next time I might just use a little less of the green olives.

This is an easy way to prepare a trayfull of delicious appetizers.  A bit of advice; make sure you don't use the "chunky" style salsa because you just can't pick up chucks with these bite-sized roll ups.  I'm sure these would also be good dipped in a sour cream/salsa combination.  Maybe next time.

I tweaked the recipe a bit, adding some powdered Ranch dip/dressing mix, used chopped Kalamata olives, and also some chopped sundried tomatoes. Then, I added crabmeat, and also mixed in the salsa with the mixture, rather than serving it on the side.  This was great!  However, I found that the mixture was only enough to spread onto 4 (10 inch) tortillas, not 8 of them as the original recipe stated.  Anyway, great idea!

Due to the great reviews, I made these, but, ewww, they were gross. Sorry.  I like olives, but all I could taste in these was salt, and the texture was sticky and mushy.  On the bright side, one boy at my daughter's party kept eating them.  Everyone has different taste.

This was really good!  Lots of compliments.   It is very olive-y tasting so have to be a real olive fan to like it. I should mention though, that I doubled the recipe and bought 16 tortillas and it only made 9 - 10" tortillas, spread thinly when one batch says it will make 8.

Very good.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and substituted the sour cream for the mayonnaise and just mixed the salsa into the filling.  I also omitted the green olives.  I doubled the filling recipe and it made enough for about 9 tortillas.

I changed it up a bit and instead of green olives I put green chilis and also added a bit of taco sauce to the middle. It wasn't my favorite recipe, but the group I served it too loved it.

These were good but not wonderful. I would make them again but double the filling. I found it difficult to cut them, even after placing them in the freezer to harden. Use a good knife.

I think this would turn out better if the mixture was left in the refridgerator for a couple of hours so the flavors could mix.  I added taco seasoning, too, but it just did not taste like everything blended well.  I might try again sometime but add a little more of something and let it sit for a few hours before putting it in the tortillas.

Someone thought I should try this so I did. I omitted the olives and added a sprinkling of taco seasoning on each one before rolling up. I think I would have preferred sour cream instead of mayo. I almost gave this a 3 but was feeling generous.

I made this recipe for our neighbours in Germany. They loved it, something they had never tasted. I omitted the olives as most Germans dont like olives.

Delicious!!!  I have made these 3 or 4 times now for parties or get-togethers and everyone loves them and wants the recipe.  The only negative is that my hubby gets upset, because there are never any leftovers!  Excellent recipe!

These were super salty.  They tasted OK, but if you don't like salt (or of course, olives), I wouldn't recommend them.  I forgot to serve them with salsa, I don't know if that would have made a difference in the saltiness.

Very easy to make, excellent taste.  Olive lovers would definitely love this. Non olive lovers would like it as well. But might want to put less green olives in it though, they may find it to be too salty otherwise. I will be making this again and again.

This recipe was well recieved as an appetizer to carnitas, meaning that the plate was left empty.  I thought it was a little bland so I added a few cloves of roasted garlic. I took the advice of others and added green chilis instead of green olives, cut the green onion down to 3. Very easy to make.

These were very addictive!  I used less green olives and green onions than the recipe called for because it seemed like too much.  I let them sit overnight before I sliced them and I think it helped blend the flavors.  I brought these to a party and everyone loved them.  One of the girls isn't an olive fan, but she really liked them too.

These were pretty good, although my mom loved them.  I did however changed it up by omitting the green olives for jalepeno peppers and added cilantro.  I made these for a test run, but I felt these weren't good enough to be one of the platters at my party.

My wife loves these.  Putting the green olives in the chop setting of your blender or food processor saves time.  I usually use flavored tortillas such as Tomato Basil or Garlic, Spinach, Herb for a nice presentation.  They are excellent when served with Don Pablos Salsa (relatively new on the shelf of some grocery stores), which seems to have just the right complementary taste.  Great, great recipe.  They have been a staple of my college football parties for years now.  I can't make enough.

Very easy, quick appetizer to throw together in a pinch. I had mixed the salsa in with the cream cheese mixture, it turned out well. Next time I'll keep the salsa on the side, and try it that way. This is a super recipe to let the kids help in the kitchen with.

These go like "hotcakes" in my household. Everyone loves them. As we like things hot and spicy I use hot salsa and just a few minced jalapenos for a extra kick. We do serve with additional salsa.(hot, of course)

This is a good party food. And it is much better if you make it ahead of time. I like cream cheese and green olives so I thought it was good.If you like green olives you will love this recipe. Make sure and make it a day ahead to get the full flavor My family didn't care for it since cream cheese and green olives arn't for there tastes. Thanks for the recipe! .

This is wonderful.  I made the filling the night before and put it in the refrigerator to chill. I left out the green olives and substituted jalapenos instead. I also put pimientos and salsa in it and it was an absolute HIT at the wedding shower I took it too.  I will definately make this again. Thanks for the recipe Kathy!!!

Pretty good, very easy to make and they keep well overnight in the fridge (wrapped in clingfoil). I added some onion and garlic powder to the mixture for taste. Very good with hot salsa for dipping!

I thought these were Delicious!!!  Although if you don't like olives, you may not like this recipe.  Fortunately for me, I love them.

I made these for a party and everyone loved them.  A little time consuming but worth it.  They also keep very well.  I will make them again and add some green chili.

These were wonderful!  I used low fat mayo, fat free burritos, and 1/3 less fat cream cheese, and added the salsa to the mix.  It was great without the extra fat!  As for streatching the recipe, I only put the filling in the middle of the burrito instead of covering the entire burrito.  It came out with seven rolls.  It was plenty.  Great idea!  It was a hit!

Loved this recipe! I used flavored tortillas instead of plain flour tortillas for an added kick. I also agree with doubling the recipe because I could only fill 4 tortillas.

These were great, and very easy to make.  A real no-brainer appetizer!  I found the filling in the recipe was only enough to spread thinly on 4 - 10" tortillas, however:  I would say double the amount of filling if you are serving a crowd.  These were universally popular with the crowd I served. :-)

These were delicious.  The only thing I wondered about tho, is there is no way I could have used 8 tortillas.  I only had enough spread for 4.  I would definately fix these again.

These were FANTASTIC! We enjoyed the leftovers with crackers. They were completely devoured at our NYE party.

Filling is delish. I used food processor and pulsed until good consistency. They are in the frig. now rolled and  wrapped in plastic. They are for a Halloween community party tomorrow. I hope they firm up and don't get soggy.

I mixed in 1/3 c. Homemade green salsa instead of mayonnaise and left out green olives.  They were delicious.

Not what I expected.  I agree with previous folks who suggested doubling the filling.  I also agree with another reviewer who said it was very "mayonaisy" and the roll ups were somewhat soft and "soggy".  That said, they were easy to make and the filling was tasty.

I made this for a cocktail evening and loved it!  So easy and quick but so tasty.  The only change I made was adding some cayenne pepper for a bit of zip!  I will make these again and again!  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these exactly as written, and they were good, but if I were to make them again, I would probably substitute sour cream for at least half of the mayonnaise, and maybe add a little seasoning to the mix. This seems like a good basic recipe that can be varied according to what you have on hand. Ideas: Cream cheese, sour cream, shredded cheddar, taco seasoning; Cream cheese, mayo, crumbled bacon, sun dried tomatoes; Cream cheese, pesto, chopped pine nuts; and on and on! :)  You could even make a sweeter version (without the salsa side) ... cream cheese, a sprinkling of brown sugar, cinnamon and chopped berries ... dip in melted butter! OK, I'm stopping now ... :)

My niece made these for her Spanish class and they were a hit! We're making them again for another project and this time we're prepared to make twice as much (if she doesn't eat them all first!)

I made this for a family gathering around christmas, they were good (if you like olives) and I do but there seemed to be something missing from this recipe. But most of my guests liked them.   Lori

I brought these as part of my birthday treat for work and they were a big hit!! Several people wanted the recipe. I substitued cheddar cheese for the green olives. I had more than enough to cover the 8 tortillas.

These were awesome!!  My husband doesn't like olives and he loved this appetizer.  Even my 5 year old son thought these were great.  They were so easy to make.  I'm going to make them for a holiday appetizer exchange and I'll definitely have to bring the recipe along!!

This was a great recipe to bring to a bookclub meeting. Everyone loved them and kept asking for the recipe. I added a little hot sauce for flavor.
Thanks for the easy "bring-a'long" recipe.

Used this recipe for a wedding reception and it was a big hit!  This is an easy make-ahead dish as the filling can be made the night before!  I got requests for the recipe before the reception was even over!

These were very well recieved at the meeting I brought them to. I will definitely make them again! I followed the recipe exactly..."6 green onions"...usually means 6 bulbs with their tops which could have 4 or 5 green "fronds" on each bulb.  If you go by that...there is more than enough to spread on 8 tortillas.

I find it to be a little time consuming but worth the effort.
