I gave it a three because I'm just using it as a guide - I added the following ingredients after changing the amount to six servings.

2-1/4 stalks celery, chopped
3 cloves garlic, chopped
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon ground dried sage
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary

This was a great soup after Thanksgiving -- when you are tired of cooking and just want to use leftovers.  I used Penne pasta, added quarter of an onion (diced), a couple of shakes of garlic powder, a couple of shakes of oregano and basil, and teaspoon of pepper.  Loved it!

Really good.  Added spices and some veggies.  I used great Amish noodles and we had it right before the snow started!

A good start to a great soup! I doubled the veggies adding some onion, cooked low fat sausage in it (rather than the turkey). Very easy and good!

Great idea for leftover turkey.  I liked the simplicity.  I left out celery because I donâ€™t like it.
