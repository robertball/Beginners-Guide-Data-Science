I was pleasantly surprised how well the watermelon and bell pepper went together. I will make this again for a quick and refreshing slush.

Not my favorite. Yes very refreshing but the bell over powered all of the other flavors. I added coconut milk and still to much bell. Plus big pieces of bell skin in every sip. Might be better for a lunch drink rather than breakfast.
