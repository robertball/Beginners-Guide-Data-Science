Way tooo much Liquid Smoke.. I had to try watering it down with more ketchup and water, but I did not care for this at all. Could be a good basic BBQ sauce with less Liquid Smoke but I haven't retried it yet.

I wanted an easy recipe  for bbq sauce and found this--it was perfect.  The only change I made was adding 2 tbsp. sriracha, because I wanted some heat, and no water, and it was really delicious.  The butter added a nice richness to the sauce, and best of all, my picky husband really liked it!!!

I was out of barbeque sauce & needed a quick & easy recipe for a bear brisket.  This was quick & easy to whip together.  The only change I made was to add a dash of garlic powder & onion powder.  I covered the pressure cooked bear brisket with this barbeque sauce & cooked it on high in the crockpot for a few hours.  It was my husbands birthday dinner & he, along with the rest of us, enjoyed every bite.  I will keep this recipe for future emergencies!
