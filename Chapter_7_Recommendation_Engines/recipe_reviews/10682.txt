These are great cookies if cooked right.  First and foremost, cover your cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Yes, some of the candy will melt out of the cookie so use your spatula to scoop it up as soon as the sheet is removed from the oven.  Secondly, preheat the oven to 350 and cook for 10-12 min.  And lastly, use bigger candy bars for more candy chunks in each bite!

This is actually a pretty good cookie if you can get it to turn out right.  Here are some tips to get good results: chop the candy bar up in very small pieces, spray the cookie sheet, cooling rack and metal spatula with non-stick cooking spray.  Doing these things will help make this cookie less messy to make.

Not a good cookie, and as someone who makes a lot of cookies I could tell as I was making them they were going to be a disaster. The candy melts faster than the cookie bakes and then sticks to the pan (which is hard to do because it is nonstick) and the cookie kind of flattened and melted before it even had time to bake. I threw the batter away after the first batch...sorry.

I had high hopes for this recipe and I was extremely dissapointed with the final outcome. This is only good for using as a base for "A la mode" desserts not as cookies.

This is the original Baby Ruth cookie recipe except a very important step was omitted - chill for 30 minutes.  That may be why people sre having trouble.
