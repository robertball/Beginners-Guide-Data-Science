This recipe may have a misprint in the size of the bread pans.  I used four 3 1/4" X 6 1/4" pans, and I had enough left over for an additional loaf in a 5" x 9" pan!  It also took about 1 hour and 20 minutes to cook, and the prep took longer than 20 minutes, also.  I did not toast the coconut, and I used light brown sugar instead of dark brown, but other than those two minor changes, I followed the recipe exactly.  This is indeed a very dense bread, and I'm sure that was the reason for the extra needed cooking time.  As far as the flavor is concerned, the banana flavor was hidden by the primary flavor of cinnamon, with coconut being the next flavor I detected, and I don't think anything would be gained from actually toasting the coconut.  If I make this again, I think I will do muffins, so the dough will be done without over-browning.

Definitely will make this again, delicious and healthy. I made these into large muffins for a quick morning grab and sprinkled extra nuts with a half date on top.  Greased and floured the tins but omitted the white sugar and cinnomin

This was my very first time to make banana nut bread and the only changes I made was using shortening for half of the butter amount and butter for the other half! Not dates or coconut just pecans and walnuts. Not sure if that makes a difference or not but this recipe is delicious!!!! This is the best banana nut bread I have ever had!! So happy with it!

Love this bread!  I made this while being snowed in and had to due several substitutes due to lack of ingredients which worked fine.  This recipes was my guideline.  It was sweet and healthy! {Substituted regular oats for quick oats; 3 of the bananas for 1and 3/4 cups of apple sauce;a blend of white sugar, Florida Crystals and a little bit of light brown sugar for dark brown sugar.  I didn't have any dates, but I added chocolate chips.}
