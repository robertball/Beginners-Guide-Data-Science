This is a good recipe.  It's from the Betty Crocker Recipe Box circa 1971.  Betty also suggests an "Orange Butter Icing" which really completes this cookie.

This recipe is awesome!  My mom even loved it!  I will definitely make this again!  Suggestion, if you want more of a carrot taste, use more than a cup of carrots.  I also had to use more flour to make the mix more stiff.

I don't know if I would use coconut the next time I make these but they were pretty tasty.  I made them at Halloween which was a good time because they come out orange.

These are very good & not very sweet, which is nice. Didn't have the coconut, which may have made this a 5-star, but otherwise was a cake texture.

What a great recipe for fresh carrots!  My kids love them - a great recipe for school lunches (without the nuts).

I made this recipe without the coconut.  I added 1/4 cup of wildflower honey for extra sweetness and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  It was still very bland.  I topped it with buttercream icing and the kids liked it.  I think it would be good with chopped nuts.

Made these cookies today and they were great. Used the leftover pulp from making carrot juice and added a little water.  You can use the pulp for thickening soups and stews too.

these cookies were pretty good, but very bland. i did make a few changes, but none of them would have made them blander. i subbed 1/2 c of applesauce for the shortening, used canned carrots, and added 1/2 tsp cinnamon. the texture of this cookies was perfect! i think adding brown sugar, 1 tsp cinnamon and maybe choc. chips would make this recipe a keeper.

Loved this recipe. I used a large (3 Tbsp) cookie scoop  and a silicone baking mat. The somewhat large cookies needed about 11 minutes in the oven.

Very good cookies! I'm not sure if I mashed the carrots enough so I ended up with little flecks of carrot rather than orange-dyed cookies. The batter was softer than the cookie recipes I usually make, and I dropped by tablespoons instead of teaspoons and ended up with 42 soft, cakey mounds. I wouldn't leave out the coconut as it provides just the right hint of uncomplicated flavour.

This is a recipe that I remember from childhood. I loved it so much that I have made it for my own kids. I will now be making it for my grandkids, and hoping they love it as well.
