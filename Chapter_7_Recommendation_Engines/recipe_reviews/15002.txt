This makes an excellent cookie. My mother used to make a cookie like this when I was a little girl. I can't remember if her's was as cake like but I think it was close. Either way, we really love these. I did a few things different. I replaced over half of the butter with applesauce and I used brown sugar as well as white and added in some walnuts for crunch. I think the applesauce, oatmeal, and bananas makes it a good cookie to give children. It's a little healthier than your normal chocolate chip cookie! Thanks Jenny!

I revised the receipe.  Instead of chocolate chips I have used dried cranberries and dried blueberries.  Everyone loves the cookies.  Another thing I have learned is cook all of your cookies on parchment paper and never melt your butter in the microwave.

When I made these cookies I used 1/4 tsp nutmeg in place of the cloves.  I kept the cinnamon the same amount.  It turned out great, they are moist chewy cookies.  I took them to work and they were gone.  I've had several requests for this recipe.

Yum!  My family gobbled these up.  I will make two changes next time:  only 1/2 tsp. of cloves, and I will change the sugar to 3/4 white and 1/4 brown.  They also freeze very well!

Pretty darn good!  I only used 2 bananas and added about 3/4 raisins instead and they worked and tasted GREAT!  Kevy

Huh? I don't know what recipe some of these guys followed...these cookies are yummy! I always add more spices than recipes call for, and since we're at a higher altitude I have to add more flour/oatmeal, but these are really good, moist, and flavorful. A nice change. Thanks for sharing it.

I know most banana cookies are cake like--thats the part of the recipe we liked. We didn't care for the way the spices tasted with the chocolate chips--maybe too much ground clove?? I may try this again and decrease the clove, increase the cinnamon and maybe add some nutmeg.

These cookies were great. Not bland at all. Healthier than your average cookie and the kids ( 1 & 3 ) loved them! Could use a little more sugar (but I like them the way they are) probably just a 1/4 cup more.

These cookies were very disappointing.  I made them twice because I thought maybe the first time I did something wrong.  They weren't tasty and were cakey and almost like muffins.  Nobody ate them.

I used coconut oil in place of margarine and put walnuts instead of chocolate chips. These came out great. Think I'll try craisins next time. Very easy recipe and yummy cookies.

I made these changes and they're SOOO yummy!!! My dad and I ate them out of the oven and they have wonderful flavor and texture.  Half white half brown sugar, all butter, all spelt flour, 1 tea salt, 1/2 tea nutmeg (omit cloves), and double the cinnamon banana and oatmeal.  I split the dough in half and added milk chocolate chips in one and walnuts in the other. The walnuts bunch won with the family by far. The texture of the cookies tastes like the center piece of banana bread, real soft and chewy, just how we like it:) UPDATE! I just made these again today for a family get together and they got RAVE reviews. My mom and grandma who try to stay away from cookies couldn't keep their hands off them, hehee! :) And the boys gobbled them up.

Excellent!! I just made these and they are perfect! They are quite cake-like but thats exactly what I was looking for. I only made a few adjustments due to supplies on hand. I only used 2 bananas (all I had) and replaced the cloves with 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I made 1/2 a batch with chocolate chips and the other with dried cranberries. I have tried many recipes on this site and I am happy to say that this is the first time I have written a review because it's the first time I have felt compelled to do so! :) I imagine the negative reviews are simply from a matter of taste. These are delicious. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These cookies are SO yummy!  I too made some modifications...

INGREDIENTS:
1 cup brown sugar,
1 cup butter,
2 eggs,
1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour,
1 1/4 teaspoon baking soda,
2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice,
4 ripe bananas, mashed,
2 cups rolled oats,
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips, 
1 cup peanutbutter chips.

I used about 3/4 of the batter to make bars (in a bar pan).  I baked the bars at 375 for 20 minutes and it came out perfectly.  I still had enough dough leftover to make 2 dozen cookies.  I'm headed to the store to buy a tub of cream cheese frosting for my bars!  YUM.
**Also, this recipe makes much more then the 24 stated. Unless those are 24 HUGE cookies.  I could have gotten 6 doz. good sized cookies with this recipe.

I found that 3 bananas made the dough to runny, will only use 2 in the future. Nice taste and texture.

Excellent recipe. I did not have chocolate chips so I put some semi-sweet chocolate in the food processor and added that in instead.

I have made these cookies over and over! I am always looking for another way to use up those over-ripe bananas. 

I also substituted the cloves for nutmeg. Yum. I always make a double batch and they are eaten quickly. Great recipe.

These are great little cookies!  I didn't have white sugar in the house, so I used 1/2 brown sugar.  They turned out moist and very, very tasty.  Kids would love them!!

**Just to add to this....This is my kids' favorite cookie recipe!  I freeze cookie balls and then pop a few in the oven when they get home from school.  They LOVE it!
It combines three things my family loves.  Oats, bananas and chocolate!  One of the most requested cookies in our house!  So cakey and yummy!!!!  I only decreased the amount of cloves to abouut 1/2 tsp, only because it was a little strong for our taste.  Otherwise, I follow recipe to a T.

These are very good!  After reading the reviews, I was worried that they would be too cake-like, so I added a small box of instant vanilla pudding to the flour mixture.  I also considered the comments about too much clove flavor so I used 1/2 tsp of allspice instead of the 1 tsp cloves.  Everyone in my family loves nuts, so I added a cup of finley chopped walnuts.  Delicious!

VERY BLAND!  TIPS: use 1/2 c. white sugar and 1/2 c. packed brown sugar, also 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  Increase baking temp to 400 F.  and baking time to 20 mins.  Also increase oats to 3 c. and salt to 1 1/2 tsp.  Then they're ok.  Maybe even a brown sugar frosting or something, a caramel dip, they need something.

It's a really good cookie! I added a little brown sugar and extra vanilla, used nutmeg instead of clove and only 2 bananas because that's all I had.

Yummy!  Lots of flavor and nice and soft.  I cut back the cloves to 1/2 tsp just because I feel its a strong flavor and I didn't want it to overpower the cookie.  A keeper that will be added to the cookie rotation.

These were OK.  They are nice and moist and very cake-like.  I could definitely taste the spices, but they didn't taste like much else.  In the interest of full disclosure, I subbed some applesauce for some butter and added chopped walnuts.

Very delicious!
My mom and sisters loved the recipe.
I made half in a cookie sheet and half in a cupcake sheet so those came out like cute muffins.
I added some shredded coconut on top before placing into the oven and a piece of walnut, made it look elegantly pretty!
Also a little powered sugar when out the oven.
Thanks for the recipe!!

Not too bad!  I made some modifications similar to another user - used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup applesauce. I also used about half a tsp of nutmeg instead of cloves simply because I don't have any cloves.   I thought they were a bit floury tasting and might try using 3 cups oats and 1 cup flour. I'm not sure if that will work or not. I will also add the bananas last next time so that I have some banana pieces instead of just the flavor.   These are not your traditional cookie, but that should be apparent. I thought they were good and even my picky 16 year old daughter liked them. I have dough in the fridge for the weekend and I bet they'll taste even better after the flavors have blended more!

I made a 1/2 recipe. The banana, MILK chocolate chips and oats were great! Soft cookies, not crispy or crunchy, but not like a muffin either.

This cookie is deliciously rich and satisfying.  I made the recipe with butter instead of margarine and only used 1/2 tsp of cloves.  It has what I love about chocolate chip cookies with the texture I love in oatmeal cookies.  The banana flavor is just right!  The cookie is moist and crunchy at the same time.

I just made this recipe (with a few changes).  I did as one reviewer suggested and subbed 1 banana with about 3/4 cup raisins, and did as another reviewer suggested and used about 1/2 T nutmeg instead of cloves (I didn't have any).  I think the cookies are delicious!  They're very moist and chewy.  I will definitely make again, but might add just a touch more cinnamon next time.  Oh--and they don't spread very much and rise instead when baking.  Thank you so much!

Substitutions: apple sauce (margarine), dark brown sugar (white sugar), whole-wheat flour (flour); Added: dried blueberries, raisins; Changes: 4 bananas (only because I had them); Bake Time: 20+ mins (waited to brown on sides and checked bottom was browned); Results: more cake-like consistency, tasty, right sweetness, wished it was more like the store-bought texture of oatmeal raisin cookies.

My whole family loved these. I used bananas that were about to go bad, no waste. :) I also replaced half of the butter with applesauce. No reason to feel bad about giving my kids cookies!

This is a great recipe that combines bananas, oats,and chocolate chips. For those who are diabetic and watching fat intake you can still make this recipe.  You can substite Splenda for Baking Blend for the sugar.  You can also use "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter' for the butter. I made them with the ingredients for the original yield of 4 dozen I got 7 dozen + 3 cookies by using a Medium Scoop from Pampered Chef to make the cookies.  A melon baller might work.  I froze quite a few cookies.

The cloves over powered the recipe, so I suggest using only half of a teaspoon of cloves. Otherwise they were delicious.

One of my favorite cookie recipes.  And a great use for ripe bananas.  I use 1/2 cup each white and brown sugar and milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  Always have people ask for the recipe.

These were very good.  My husband and kids LOVE them.  I find them a tad more cakelike than I prefer but the taste is wonderful.  I did take the advice of others and used an extra 1/4 cup sugar and used rounded instead of level teaspoons of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Will definately make again.

I prefer to use brown sugar instead of white.  These were really good.  I made some for my husband to take to work and told him to call them banana bread cookies.  He took more than 2 dozen and brought none home.

I generally try to avoid altering a recipe before the first time I try it, but I didn't have enough margarine. So I used olive oil for the remaining half. The result: I didn't have any of that "cakiness" problem as described in some of the other reviews. However, the dough didn't spread out in the oven as well as I liked. After spreading it out a bit in subsequent batches, everything was right as day.

These are REALLY yummy! They're like a piece of banana bread with a bit more substance because of the oatmeal. I made a few switches, though. I used brown sugar instead of white, butter instead of margarine, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg instead of cloves, and milk chocolate chips instead of the semi-sweet. I think these could definitely be made into a healthier version. I'll try a whole-wheat version next time...maybe throw in some flax-seeds, too. This recipes is a keeper!

Thanks so much.  I love banana bread but was getting a little tired of it.  I also love that I have another recipe for cookies.  I prefer to make cookies for my kids so that I know what's going into them.

I debated rating this recipe since I revised it so much but I did enjoy my cookies so I decided to share anyway. I know most banana and oat cookies are cake like which I still enjoy.  However, it has been my experience the more bananas included the less likely for it to taste as well after a couple of days, so I only put in one banana. To add some additional flavor I put a couple tsps of coffee to the mashed banana (I got this idea from a muffin recipe that had turned out well) and let it sit for 10 minutes before commencing with the rest of the recipe.  For the spices I did 1/4 tsp cloves, 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I didn't think chocolate chips sounded very good with those spices so I did as another suggested and added dried cranberries and dried blueberries (technically mine were cranberries that were "blueberry juice infused" by ocean spray). To cut some additional calories I cut down on the margarine to 3/4 cup and the sugar to 3/4 cup as well as changing to 1/2 cup brown sugar 1/4 cup regular sugar.  On top of all these changes I also tested out the quantity of the oats. I did the batch with 1 cup then split the batch in half and added 1/2 cup oats to one batch and left the other half as is with 1 cup's worth of oats. I thought both batches turned out well to me the additional oats made the cookies slightly more cake like but my hubby said the opposite. As I enjoyed the one with less oats more but my husband with more oats I will make again the same way.

Calling these cookies is a bit of  stretch i would call them banana bread cookies or mini banana breads... non the less they were awesome, i used butter instead of margarine took out the cloves and added a 1/2 tsp of salt. Getting them off the sheets was a bit of a problem because they were so soft but just let them cool a min or two. I also had just regular banana not ripe. Cooked for 10 min on 375 and they were absolutely delicious. I was able to yield more than 24 with this recipe and had to make another batch cuz my buds tore thru them. If u want a soft gooey banana bread cookie these are the bee's knees.

I LOVE these cookies, and so does my 4 1/2 year old son, who dislikes bananas unless they're baked in something...I used 1/2 the butter, and half applesauce. I also left out the chocolate chips, and I used white whole wheat flour. The cookies are fluffy, almost muffin-like, but they were so easy to make, with less cleanup than muffins! Thanks, I will certainly bake these next time I have bananas!

Very yummy cookies, good recipe.  I just changed it a little, only put 1/2 tsp of ground cloves and 3/4 cup of white sugar.  They came out wonderful - really soft and the kids loved them.

Mmmm yummy! Mine didn't really spread out at all in the oven, so next time I'll make sure to flatten them a bit before baking. Followed the recipe exactly, baked for 11 minutes.

These are pretty good.  I made them exactly according to the recipe.  They turned out very soft and fluffy, cake-like.  The cinnamon and cloves compliment the banana flavor.  I think raisins would be a better addition than chocolate chips and that is what I will do next time.  Another great recipe for my overripe bananas!

My children (5 & 7) loved these cookies. My 5 year old, who is a very picky eater, commented "You should make these every day!"  I substituted butter instead of margarine and raisins instead of chocolate chips.  These cookies are moist and cake-like, much more fun than banana bread. Next time, I plan to use brown sugar and white sugar.  The spices were just right.  The recipe made 3 dozen large cookies, which my boys were eager to share with the other kids in the neighborhood, who liked them too.  Tip: Save your overripe bananas in the freezer. When you are ready to use them wash the peel right off under warm running water and defrost the inside of the bananas in the microwave.  That way, when your urge to bake hits you, you will always have overripe bananas on hand.  And they never have to go to waste when you are too busy!

Not sweet enough to be a great cookie.  Tastes like a muffin, but in a cookie shape.  I was hoping for more of a crunchy or chewy cookie, and these are soft and cake-like.  I'd rather make a banana loaf in comparison to these cookies.

An excellent way to use up over ripe bananas when you've had enough of muffins!  I was concerned that the batter was creamier than most cookie batters, but they baked up well.  Second batch was more firm I guess because oatmeal absorbed more batter.  Just a caution, tho, the clove comes through clearly in the finished cookie, so if you are not a fan, omit it.

Sorry, I just didn't care for these cookies.  The cloves were just too overpowering.  If you are going to try this recipe I suggest using no cloves. I think this recipe has potential, but I probably won't try it again.

I skipped the cloves, and tried using 1 cup whole wheat with 1 cup all-purpose flour, and used 1/3 c. brown sugar with 2/3 white.  The cookies came out poofy, as expected - almost a cookie-muffin hybrid.  Cuffin?  Moofkie?

A tasty way to use up bananas and add some fiber to your day.  Delicious warm with a glass of cold milk!

I read the some other reviews before making these cookies, so I knew what to expect.  They are cake-like, which isn't bad, just different.  I didn't put the full amount of cloves in, partially because of the reviews, but also because I was nearly out of cloves!  They were a hit in my family and another way to use up ripe bananas.  I'll probably make them again.

These cookies were nothing to write home about. Very bland the 1st time I made them. I tried it again a 2nd time and added more chocolate chips and raisins to the recipe, plus doubled the spices. I also baked them less to make them softer. The 2nd time around they were better, but still nothing amazing. I won't be making these again.

These are wonderful! Added 1/3 c sugar, and used walnuts, raisins and chocolate chips. I used just a sprinkle of cinnamon and no nutmeg (Just don't like nutmeg) Also used 1/2 c margarine, 1/2 c shortening-don't know if it makes any difference, just didn't have enough margarine in the house.

The taste was a little bland until i added more spices.More cake-y than cookie, very spongy and kind of dry. If it weren't for the chocolate chips my family would not eat them.

I substituted ingredients to make these cookies gluten free, vegan and naturally sweetened. They took about about 15-20 minutes to bake. Here is the recipe I used: • 1/4 cup brown rice syrup • 1/2 cup vegan butter  • 1 cup applesauce • 2 eggs substitute • 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  • 2 cups gluten free all-purpose flour  • 1 teaspoon baking soda  • 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg  • 2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  • 2 ripe bananas, mashed  • 2 cups “Quick Cooking” Irish oatmeal • 1 cup blueberries (or raisins) • 1/2 cup walnuts, chopped

These were good, but I changed the ingredients to make them a little less rich, as I wanted to give them to my kids. I cut the butter in half and replaced the butter I cut with applesauce. This added a ton of moisture, and cut the fat big time! I also used 1\2 whole wheat flour, and substitued nutmeg for the cloves, and added 1\2 dark chocolate chips and half milk chocolate chips. I also used quick oats in place of rolled, because that's what I had on hand. All in all, basic substitutions. I agree that these came out very cakelike- almost like little mini banana breads. I know that some of that had to do with the whole wheat flour, but knowing what I know about baking, these would have been very cakelike anyway. However, they are delicious, and my 2 year old devoured them!

The recipe was easy to make and tasted great. The only issue that I had was the cook time. When I make other cookies I take them out when they start to brown and they finish browning on the pan before I move them to the rack to cool. These did not brown any more once I removed them from the oven. I ended up cooking them longer to get them to brown, which made them taste the best.

WOW!!! I have to start off by saying I HATE banana's, but these cookies are sooo super moist and soft.  It's like I'm eating a mini banana bread only 10 billion times better.  The only changes I made are adding pecans instead of chocolate chips and changed the cloves to 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  YUM!!!!!

I'm not a cookie baker but it turned out good my family loved them. now I'm waiting for the results from the children in school because I made them for my grandaughter's class. I substituted raisins for chocalate chips I don't like chocolate chips.

1)I only had whole wheat flour, and they were still good...kindof like bite size banana bread, just perfect for little fingers ;) 2)I used butterscotch chips, which went quite nicely with the clove and banana. For those who wanted this sweeter, just add more chips. 3) I added 1/2t salt. It slightly brings out flavors.

These were OK.  I think maybe bananas don't belong in cookies.  I love banana muffins, bread, etc. but in cookies it just made them too puffy and soft without enough sweet flavor.

these cookies were very nice, and i really liked the flavours but as others have said they turned out more like flat cakes, the mixture was very much like a cake mixture. don`t get me wrong they tasted nice but i prefer my cookies to be crunchier more like a biscuit, so i was a little dissapointed.

I agree that these were more like "cakies" (as another reviewer called them) than cookies but they were still fantastic.  I used butter instead of marg and used raisins instead of chocolate chips.  I was worried at first because my batter was pretty thin (cake like) but I just spooned it onto the baking sheet and hoped for the best.  They did spread out quite a bit while baking.  I scaled the recipe down to 12 and got 18 good sized "cakies".  Will make these again and again I'm sure.

This is a very cake like cookie - I think it could use more oats to make it more cookies like. I followed the recipe with the exception of subbing half the marg with applesauce.

Pretty good just not what i was expecting from the picture.

I was looking for a sort of breakfast cookie for on the go and this one was great.  I did some changes as other mentioned- 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 cup margarine, 1/2 cup of applesauce, no cloves but added a shake of pumpkin pie spice and a little nutmeg along with the cinnamon, 1 cup choc. chips, and 2/3 cup mini choc. chips.  These are very much like muffin tops or cake so we called them "cakies" instead of cookies.  Give them a try.

Very good cookie!  I made a few adjustments - used 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup white.  Also, used 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup applesauce to make it a little healthier.  These taste like muffin tops to me (pretty cake-y), but personally I like that texture.

These are awesome! I made some suggested modifications: 1/2c white sugar 1/2c brown sugar, 1/2c butter 1/2c applesauce, 1/2 tsp nutmeg instead of cloves, and 2c chocolate chips. They are tasty and delicious, just the right amount of banana flavor. Cakier than your average cookie, but I like chewy cookies, so it's all good.

These cookies are fabulous!  Of course I made tons of changes to them too, but without a good base, you have no where to start.  I cut the sugar in half, and used a bit less butter.  Then I added a single fat free vanilla yogurt, a few sprinkles of wheat germ, and instead of chocolate chips I added a trailmix with lots of seeds and dried fruit, then dates and coconut.  They are so wonderful!  You can really taste the banana but they just feel healthy and hearty.  Yum!!!

These shouldn't really be called "cookies" -- as a previous review stated they are more like little cakes.  Yes, very tasty (my two kids gobbled them up), but not at all what I was expecting (thus a lower rating).  I doubt I will make them again unless I made them as bars or muffins.  If that were the case I would probably cut back on the sugar a little and add some frosting.

We used brown sugar instead of white, added a pinch of salt and a wee bit of cloves (instead of the full amt), plus 1/2 c more chocolate chips. It turned out very soft, sweet but not over the top. Will make again.

BAM! Good cookies. We didn't use cloves, that sounded whack. Instead, we added a dash of nutmeg. We only used one cup of oatmeal and we regret it. Too muffinny. Possibly more chocolate chips would be better, as the bites without any chocolate leaves a little to be desired. We used 3/4 to 1/4 white sugar to brown sugar - good call. We are 2:1 in favor of raisins (we made about 1/3 with them) - if you like baked raisins, add 'em fo sheezy. We also added some walnuts, texturey and tasty but not necessary. In conclusion (2:1), the cookies would get five stars if they were a lil' less cooffiny.
Holla at cho tummy,

I made these cookies for my 13 month old daughter (who loves oatmeal raisin cookies...I wanted to try something different). I used raisins instead of chocolate chips and nuts.  They come out soft, to me almost the texture of a muffin-top.  Very tender and tasty.  However, I don't think I will make them again, as I prefer a chewier, "cookie-like" texture rather than the breadlike texture these had. Nothing wrong with them, just not my cup of tea.  I also omitted the cloves as I thought it would be too spicy for my little one.

These cookies were not good. Like others have said, they were too cakey. I tried cooking them longer to firm them up, but then they dried out almost completely. I thought the cloves were too heavy and there was not enough cinnamon. All in all, I was really disappointed in the outcome. I will not make these again.

Great cake-like cookies.  You can obviously make variations, cranberries, nuts, raisins, etc.  I added 1/4 cup more sugar though.  They were awesome.  My whole family loves them!

Subbed butter for margarine, did 1/2 cup each white and brown sugar, used chopped pecans instead of chocolate chips, used only 1/2 tsp cloves and added a bit of allspice and ginger.  Very tasty, but more like muffin tops than “cookies”.  I might try some other healthy subs (replacing some of the fat with applesauce, reducing sugar) to make it more of a healthy breakfast option.

This was a really nice recipe. All the flavors were complimentary and the cookie held it's shape very well.  I prefer to make this recipe with 2 teaspoons of cinnamon instead of the other spices, but that way is fine too. Really good recipe that is adaptable to other interpretations.

I followed the recipe to a T. I wasn’t expecting them to be so cake like. Almost like a banana muffin, but in cookie form. They didn’t spread out while baking, just puffed up. So the second batch in the oven, I squished down with a spoon. Not overly sweet, so you feel semi healthy while enjoying them. I probably will find an alternative oatmeal banana cookie recipe next time, because I enjoy a cookie with more of a chew than these.

Made a few changes, like used 1/4 cup brown sugar the other 3/4 cup white sugar (wanted to use up the last bit of brown sugar i had), added probably a half cup of peanut butter but all in all it turned out fantastic! Softest most delicious cookies I've made in a while! Definitely making again!

Great recipe and easy to make. Prep time a bit longer than indicated in recipe but the extra 10 minutes are not enough to skip over it.  I substituted the margarine with unsalted butter, the chocolate chips with chopped raisins (because that is what I had on hand) and added a generous pinch of ground black pepper. Also, I use parchment paper for all my backing and it works great with this recipe too. One cookie sheet of this first batch was gone before the last one was done baking :)

Personally, not a fan. Mine turned out more bread-like not even cake-like; they were a little dry and gummy. I'm sure this was baker error, but I wanted more of a snap of a cookie.

I will make this recipe again.  I put the oats in the blender and ground them and added with the flour.  Excellent way to use up over-ripe bananas.

This is a delicious soft cookie. The spices are present but not overpowering. I modified it by using an all purpose Gluten-Free flour (King Arthur's) plus 1/2 tsp xanthan gum (for stability).

Wonderful! I made some substitutions, some of which were my own doing, some recommended. I used softened salted butter because it's all I had. I also realized my husband used the last of the eggs for breakfast so I used a single serving container of Motts applesauce (I'm sure sweetened) as an egg substitute. Not knowing how much the salted butter or the sweetness of the applesauce would affect the taste, I used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/4 c brown sugar. Also, I substituted the clove for 1/2 t. of nutmeg. Last, but not least, I only had 2 ripe bananas left to use for this recipe. Typically, cake like cookies are not my favorite, however, I made these to be breakfast cookies and they were PERFECT. For half of the batch (for myself and the hubs) I added walnuts and a handful of Craisins. Yummy! I will be making again!

These are a regular at my house.  I often substitute 1/2 coconut oil and  1/2 butter in place of the margarine , and dried cranberries or blueberries in place of chocolate chips (I am not a fan of banana & chocolate together.)  Adding some ground flaxseed, chopped nuts, sunflower seeds ups the nutritional value.

Awesome recipe!
Only changes I made were to sub coconut oil for the margarine (~1:1) and eliminate the cloves. Took about 13 minutes to get lightly browned on the bottom but nice and fluffy. The only other note I would make because it's not mentioned is that they do puff up and rise a little bit more than (I) expected. A spoonful is a good size, but if you want slightly thinner cookies, consider spreading it out a little thinner (maybe .5-1.0" tall?).

These cookies were moist and delicious! I've made them several times, and they disappear quickly. Leave out the chocolate chips, as I often do, and you have a moist, mild, not overpoweringly sweet treat. ??

Rating a 4 only because I changed a couple things.  I didn't have ground cloves so I left that out, I used 1/2 cup each white and brown sugar, and I used 1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips.

We enjoyed these using 1 cup of wheat flour and 1 cup of white. Used butter since I didn't have margarine.  They don't spread thin so that's why they're not crunchy. I just consider them fluffy cookies. Made about 4 dozen.

I'm going to call these ones 'banana bread cookies' because that's what they remind me of! I made these earlier today - they were quite good, both directly out of the oven and once they were cooled. I made a few minor changes just for personal preference - used half packed brown sugar and half white sugar, and substituted 1tsp nutmeg for the cloves - but I'm sure they'd be just as good as written. I also added an extra half a cup of oats, since I used quick oats and they're a bit smaller. The batter seemed runny to me but even so, the dough didn't spread in the oven, resulting in soft, thick, chewy cookies - just what I was looking for!

Modifications. No cloves 1/2 tsp nutmeg instead. 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. 
These cookies were fluffy and delicious. A perfect way to use up my over ripe bananas. Will bake these again.

Super easy. Easy to double and when I ran out of oats, I just used Rice Krispies as a substitute and for some crunch. This one is a keeper!

As written, I think it's a little heavy on the cloves (can't believe other reviewers find the cookies bland!!) Like some other reviewers, I modified the recipe...used half and half brown/white sugar,1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and craisins instead of chocolate chips. Came out beautifully spicy and moist. Cakey, but I've never found a banana cookie recipe that wasn't. Will definitely make again. Might try zesting in a bit or orange if using craisins again...

Thank you very much for this recipe it is excellent, I love the texture taste  and possibilities. I did 1/2 c white sugar and 1/2 cup Splenda and I added Oat Bran and ground Flax as well figuring I would see if it could be great tasting and a little bit more healthier. It was a resounding success, I would like to warn anyone as I thought it was plenty thin enough for these additions but may have over estimated how much oat bran to add as my cookies did not spread. Though I will say when my son and I tried them they were moist and "banana bread" gooey inside...mmmmm! but that WAS when they were fresh out of the oven, I will be curious to see tomorrow's texture. We will be definitely doing these again, especially when my husband is home, I will also try adding some chopped walnuts as an extra bonus.
Thank you once again as I now have another option for my frozen bananas.

My husband loves banana bread, and I got tired of making the same old thing with ripe bananas, so I decided to try this recipe.  I added about 1/2 cup extra oats because the first batch came out like pancakes.  The extra oats did the trick and they puffed up like good oatmeal cookies should.  We also live at 8,200 ft so that may be why they didn't puff the way they should have.  I'll make this recipe again!

These are cakey cookies (but that's how I like'em) but very moist on the inside.  I subbed dark brown sugar for half the sugar and used Splenda for the remainder.  I also reduced oats by 1/4 cup and ommitted the cloves, but added an extra 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  Not too sweet, I'd make them again.

Made these with Splenda and Egg Substitute.  Great taste and texture..just like my Mom's recipe for oatmeal cookies.  AND these are SO easy to make!  They'll be a staple in our house!

The cookie was good but it is more of a muffin than a cookie.  Very soft and cake like.  Flavor is good.

These were really good but they were "cakey" as other people pointed out. I did add 1/2 tsp of salt to the recipe because I feel like cookies need salt and I used chocolate chunks instead of chips. I took them to a dinner party and they all got eaten by the end of the evening. I also noticed that the cookies seemed to get softer not harder as cookies usually do, as if they absorbed moisture or something.  I called them banana bread cookies and they were delicious.

Yummy! Followed the recipe but PB chips instead of choc. ones, added maybe 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds, and 1/2 whole wheat 1/2 AP flour. They came out quite cakey, like muffin tops, this way.

These are great cookies! Nice and moist. I substituted coconut oil for the butter, replaced 1/4 cup flour with flax seed and added butterscotch chips instead of chocolate. Fantastic.

Pretty bland. I didn't add chocolate chips (I didn't have any, and I actually wanted a healthier version)so instead I added slivered almonds. It was too fluffy for me, and it was not moist and I only baked them for 10 minutes.

I thought this was a good recipe. I changed a couple things...instead of 1C sugar I used 3/4C white sugar 1/4C brown sugar. I used real butter instead of margerine. I also separated the batch in two and did half with chocolate chips & half with walnuts & cranberries. I preferred the walnut/cranberry ones better.

These are yummy, like mini banana bread. I added skor pieces instead of chocolate chip. I only made 36 for now and am freezing the rest of the batter for another day. Will post here next time I make them to let everyone know if the batter was ok.

Has potential...I agree with some others it wasn't sweet enough to be like a cookie, also I just used cinnamon and not cloves or nutmeg...I would double the cinnamon...or maybe my cinnamon is old, it needed more flavor overall, but was nice and moist.

I've been trying to find a banana cookie recipe to use up ripe bananas, and finally this is it!  This cookie is nice and chewy and has a lovely warm flavour from the cinnamon and cloves.  Next time I'll try it with raisins.  Other than that I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for sharing.

These are so freakin' good!! I used 1 1/4 cup whole grain flour and 3/4 cup white flour, just under 1 cup sugar, and added an extra cup chocolate chips. I also added an extra VERY ripe banana to the wet ingredients before adding the flour mixture. Baked at 375 for 10 minutes! So moist and just awesome. Can't say enough about these. Thanks so much for the awesome recipe!!!

I tried this recipe because I had over-ripe bananas. I calculated for 18 cookies but it made 36!  I don't like cloves so I omitted it but put in chopped walnuts instead of chocolate chips.  Like others, my husband said that they tasted like banana bread.  For a soft cookie I think they are good.

These are pretty darned good, and a great way to use up some overripe bananas.  I subbed walnut pieces for the chocolate chips (wanting something a little healthier for my snack-happy 8 y.o.) and used apple bake spice (Watkins) for the cinnamon and clove.  I like the cake-y texture....it's like eating little banana nut muffins.  Thanks for sharing this good recipe!

This was a great recipe.  Super banana flavor.  You need to use very ripe bananas to get the stronger banana flavor.  Almost totally black.  I put in 1/2 t. salt and 3/4 t. soda.  Just changed a little according to the reviews I read. I used raisins instead of choc. chips. I bet choc. covered raisins would be good. Anyway, not as cakie this way.  Best banana cookie recipe I've ever used. Thanks so much!! For sharing...

These cookies were pretty good.  Since I was trying to make a quick batch of cookies using some very ripe bananas, I tried to only use what I had on hand so I had to make a couple of substitutions.  I didn't have any cloves so I used a little nutmeg instead.  Next time I would up that amount a little...maybe 1/2 teaspoon.  I also used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet.  After the first batch it seemed that they needed a little boost, so I added a dash of salt to the remaining dough.  This helped a lot, but it could have used a bit more, maybe 1/8-1/4 teaspoon.  My daughter who loves soft cookies liked this one best, even more after the addition of the salt.  If I make it again I'll probably use raisins instead of chocolate chips.  Overall, an okay recipe.

Great cookie!! I did modify recipe-substituted 1 cup splenda for sugar, substituted 1/2 cup applesauce & 1/2 cup butter flavored crisco for margaring, used 3 eggs & substituted 1 cup flour with 1 cup oatmeal flour (I ground oatmeal into flour)-I will make this over & over again!!

These cookies are good.  I only used 1/4 teaspoon cloves and upped the cinnamon to 1 1/2 teaspoons and added 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg.  The recipe makes more than 24, I got almost 6 dozen cookies.   I would make them again.

These are good cookies.  A lot of banana flavor. I did change the recipe.  I used butter, omitted the cloves & added 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg. I also used 2 cups of milk chocolate chips as others suggested.  I think next time I will add pecans or walnuts, too.  Soft, moist cookie.  I used the small Pampered Chef scoop & probably got 6 dozen or so cookies that are 2 inches in diameter.

This cookie is really more like a muffin in texture. I omitted the cloves in favor of nutmeg, and used a full 2 cups of semi sweet chocolate chips. Next time I may try milk chocolate chips. I think the semi sweet chips are a bit overpowering in this cookie. The dough is very wet but bakes up nicely. Nice flavor and texture.

Two thumbs up! I made some modifications the first time around: I used only 1/2 c. butter and added large chunks of apples instead of choc chips. I used 1 tsp of pumpkin spice in place of cinnamon. PERFECT! The cookies were fruity, moist and delicious. Thanks!

Super!!! These cookies were a snap to make. Had to get rid of my very ripe bananas, and this recipe caught my eye. I not only added chocolate chips, but raisins as well. All of the flavors blended together nicely without being overly sweet. Next time I might trade out some of the butter with applesauce and then nix the chocolate chips to make it more wholesome. Excellent recipe if you like soft cake-like cookies. Thank you for sharing your great recipe!

My daughter made these last night.  They are delicious.  The only thing we changed was cutting down the cloves to 1/2 tsp. and adding a dash of nutmeg.  They are soft and chewy... just the way I like my cookies.

The recipe improves with all the suggested changes, but then it's really not the same recipe. As written, cookies are very bland, greasy and pretty much a waste of time and energy.

This recipes needs a little salt. Add it when mixing the flour and baking soda. Also, I lighten it up by using egg whites, 1/2 cup butter, and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce. I left out the chocolate chips and used walnuts.  Everyone love it!

This recipe does not make a crunchy cookie. If you prefer a crunchy cookie, don't try it. If, however, you enjoy the wonderful tast of banana, chocolate chips and oatmeal, you will love these. They are like little cakes. Delicious. I got 6 dozen cookies, but I used a rounded teaspoon. I will definitely be making these often! Thanks for sharing!

Excellent cookie!  I added 1/2 cup more flour and 1 cup of peanut butter to mine.  I think nuts would go well in this cookie too but the hubby hates nuts.  =o)

Ecellent recipe. I however 3X the recipe and added 12 bananas, and only 5 eggs.  I left out some sugar and oil and included mini compound chips instead, which gave the cookie some crunch.  Definitely will make again!
