Looks like my wife's recipe for Finnish Rye Bread. I'm the Finn, not her but she bakes as if she were as Finnish as Heikki's pig. For this one she uses the water that unpeeled potatoes were boiled in, suitably cooled enough to not kill the yeast, of course. That's a trick my mother taught her. You wouldn't think that would add very much, but the potato starch really improves the texture and flavor.

Great bread!  I cut the recipe in half, and kept the whole wheat and rye flours at the same amounts, so have less bread flour.  It rose nicely.  My bread needed a few more minutes of baking time than what was called for.  I'll be baking this again!

Delicious!
In place of the water I used whey from cheese making earlier today.  Then, since I had no butter, I used coconut oil to brush on the tops when they came out of the oven.  It all worked out perfectly.
Next time I'll decrease the white and up the rye flour content.
Thank you 2CHAE, from a Canadian Finn!

My mother in law is Finnish American, raised on a farm and hearing Finn at home, Finnish Flatbread is one of her favorite 'treats' and memories of her grandmother.  I used this recipe for my first attempt at it and when she put the first bite in her mouth (still warm from the oven) she nearly choked herself trying to compliment it while eating more!!!

Thanks for making me the "Favorite Daughter In Law" (ok, I'm the only one, haha, but she still said it!)
