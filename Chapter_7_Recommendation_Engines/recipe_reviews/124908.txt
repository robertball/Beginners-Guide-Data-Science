Yum!  This was a big hit with the family!  I did find that 15 min was too long, my cake probably baked in 10 min, so watch it close.  I was worried about the cake as the batter had a very wierd texture, but it turned out just fine.  I made the chocolate sauce, easy and delicious and it makes a lot.  I thought it was much better then store bought chocolate sauce.  

And yes, the cake is low fat, so if you are watching fat intake, use low fat frozen yogurt in place of ice cream and you'll have a delicous treat...I bet some fresh strawberries or bananas would be wonderful on top.

Great dessert!  When I was making the batter it was so thick, I didn't think that it was going to come out good at all, but I continued following the recipe and it came out perfect!  I used jamoca almond fudge ice cream, and I was told that it was "better than Baskin Robbin's roll cake!!!"  I did't make the fudge sauce, though.  I just picked up a jar of hot fudge ice cream topping and drizzled it over each slice.  Next time I'll make two since it was so easy and I got such great compliments on it. It's a new family favorite.

This was my first time to brave the challenge of making a roll cake. I am pleased with the results. I tried my favorite ice cream (Breyer's Vanilla), but it gets a weird texture when soft, so it did not spread well. Remember to use a towel that is completely smooth for rolling the cake in. Also, continue mixing until the egg whites are completely combined with the chocolate even though the texture is weird along the way. (I had to "chop" at the chocolate with a spoon to mix in the first quarter of the egg whites.)

A great recipe.  I baked my roll for only 10 minutes and it came out perfect.  Each oven is different, so watch carefully.  No cracks at all.  Will be making this again. Used ice cream topping.

This recipes worked out well and I'm happy to say it didn't fall apart when I filled it with vanilla ice cream.  I served it to a group of girls who kept saying the cake tasted like cocoa. I found the cake to be "toothsome."  The chocolate sauce was delightful!

ATTENTION chocolate lovers; I love unique and yet easy deserts so this was fun to make and tasted great but I doubled the cocoa powder and added 2 TBS of oil to make up for the liquid and give a moist, richer flavor. Yes I realized just by looking at the amount of liquid that it would be too clumpy to "fold" any whites in so I added the oil first to smooth it out and just beat the whites in with my beaters untill it was all smooth. Still turned out fluffy but with a nice chocolate flavor!  You can simplify the fudge sauce for sweetened condensed milk and skip the sugar... makes it smoother and glossier... (you can microwave it 30 sec at a time to stir in between until evenly melted) For easy powdering I always keep some powdered sugar in a empty spice shaker and that way I can seal it from moister and its a no mess easy way to evenly shake your powdered sugar to touch up any simple dessert!  I also recommend using a thin tea towel for any kind of cake roll. Enjoy!

This actually turned out better than I thought it would. It furfilled my amazing craving for a roll cake from Baskin Robbins. Next time, I will add more cocoa to the cake for a richer chocolate, and use just vanilla ice cream. Instead of making the chocolate sauce supplied, I wanted something more similiar to the one at BR, so I used Hot Fudge in a jar without heating it. It gave it a gorgeous shine. Id reccommend this cake, its something not many people have had, and its fun to make.

This cake rolls well but does not taste good. I think a good cake just needs some fat. Maybe not having any butter or oil is what makes it roll well without cracking but it also lacks flavor. I had fun rolling the cake and learning the technique but now I'll look for a new recipe that tastes good.

The hot fudge is delicious! We used whole milk instead of the evaporated milk and it turned out great.

Hi all, mine is not so much a feedback since I haven't actually made the cake :P Being an inexperienced baker, I was actually wondering whether I could leave out the cocoa powder so that the roll would turn out white instead of brown? Any suggestions? I'm sorry i'm using this as a forum as I can't seem to find one on the website :P

I guess I rolled the cake too tight because my dad asked me where the ice cream was! It was his birthday and he loves this cake, but it didn't turn out like I thought it would. Next time I make this I won't roll it so tight! I added more cocoa and it tasted pretty good. I never remember eating ice cream cake rolls with chocolate sauce, so I think that was too much. It made it too chocolatey for me.

My first attempt at this cake was a disaster. The cocoa/egg yolk/flour mixture was more like cookie dough and actually bent my spoon when i was stirring it. I had a tough time figuring out how to fold the whites into something i couldnt even stir! After i put it in the oven it baked alright but sadly i took it out too early and tried to flip/roll it and yeah it just didnt work. Attempt number two was much more successful and my cake was quite delicious. I filled it with mocha almond fudge ice cream. I did not make the chocolate sauce.

I have made ice cream rolls before (mom's recipe) but had lost the recipe since last time I made it.  So I looked online, saw they were mostly similar and chose this recipe.  My mother's recipe didn't call to separate the eggs so was slightly skeptical. Read the reviews, saw it turned out decent for several folks, and since I'm no baking novice, gave it a try.
I, like several other reviewers, found the batter to be next to impossible to mix after all dry ingredients are added. The egg whites whipped fine but "fold" is not the correct term for what you have to do to mix in with the "dough/crumbs" you have in the 1st bowl.  Ended up using mixer to fully incorporate and still had lumps.
Baked 10 min, edges were crusty. Don't cool over 5 min in pan or you won't get a good roll. 
Taste=decent, needs more cocoa. Texture is dense, as it should be.
I would be inclined to say there is an ingredient (or 2) missing from recipe, except for the good results had by many of the other users. 
Oh well, gonna get my old favorite from my mom...must easier, no separating/beating egg whites...no crumbly mess and much better flavor.
Thanks for the experience!

I have made this twice now for my dad's birthday!  He loves it and it is so easy to make.  I followed the recipe almost exactly (I didn't have cake flour so I used regular all purpose organic flour.)  It turns out perfect each time.

I am a very experienced baker ... I followed the recipe and baked for 10 minutes.  The cake broke into tiny pieces.  The cake tasted like cocoa powder.  I threw the whole thing away as I had planned to serve it as a Christmas dessert to my extended family.  I'm very disappointed!!

Amazing taste.  Not so amazing presentation.  I made this for Father's Day and my entire family loved it.  I wasn't so happy with the way it looked.  The cake cracked as I was rolling it so it looked more like a layer cake than a roll.  Maybe I left it in the oven too long.  I will make this again but will have to try to find a way to make it look nicer.

The cake itself was very yummy and easy to make.  I didn't have any problems with the batter and it baked in 10 minutes in the oven.  One bit of advice is to use liberal amounts of powdered sugar on the dish towel you roll it up in and on the outside of the cake.  I used Edy's strawberry ice cream in the middle and it was divine.  I did make the chocolate sauce and it did not turn out well.  It was very runny and never thickened up at all.  I tried to add some cornstarch to it to thicken it up, but it didn't work either.  It tasted okay, but the texture was watery.  Not good with this cake because it made it soggy.  I would make the cake again, but buy a jar of hot fudge sauce for next time.

I think this is a recipe meant for highly advanced bakers! I followed the directions exactly, but the cake just didn't turn out right. The batter wouldn't mix right, the cooking time took longer than it should have and then the cake wouldn't roll right.  The taste left much to be desired. I will not try this recipe again.

Sadly, I experienced issues rolling my cake (it broke) but I'm going to try again. The cake itself was good, just in multiple pieces. I looooooved the chocolate sauce. It was way better than plain ol' chocolate syrup.

This was my first attempt at a roll cake. It was absolutely DELICIOUS.  The chocolate sauce is out of this world.  My family wishes I would make this dessert a lot more often.  Unfortunately, I still feel intimidated by a roll cake even though both of my two attempts have turned out great.The roll may not be perfect but the taste is 100% DELICIOUS.

Sorry to be blunt but this was a waste of ingredients.  The actual amounts may be good but the technique and directions resulted in a cookie dough type mixture that you had to fold egg whites in.  Not the way a genoise is supposed to be made.

Me and my daughter made this today for her b-day. We followed all the directions, and baked 12 minutes in pre-heated oven (came out just right)...we used fried ice -cream and it was really good ! Looked a little messy because some of it had melted before I got it all rolled and so ends didn't look the best..but after I cut off the ends it was really good !

I was worried while making this because my mixture was a little lumpy (as some other reviews mentioned) but I forged ahead and the cake came out fantastic.  Mine cooked in about 12 minutes and the edges were a little hard to remove from the wax paper (probably my fault for not greasing it well enough).  The only thing I would caution is to make sure the ice cream isn't melted but just soft enough to spread, mine was a little too soft and the cake basically absorbed it, so although it tasted like really yummy mint chocolate cake - there wasn't a distinct ice cream layer that I was hoping for.  I served this for a family birthday party and everyone loved it!  The chocolate fudge sauce was a great hit too!  Definitely going to make this one again.  thanks.

This recipe is wonderful! I doubled it, and although I had a tough time spreading the batter and my cake was a lumpy, bumpy thing, it actually rolled beautifully! It was yummy! I used frosting instead of ice cream and made my nephew a light sabor cake for his birthday. FUN FUN!!

This was a nice treat.  I made it for my daughter's birthday.  I filled it with home-made ice cream.  I didn't make the chocolate sauce but used hot fudge sauce instead.

Awesome....I loved it.   I didn't make the fudge topping though because I wanted to save calories!   The cake part is low fat which is an added bonus!  I used spelt flour instead of cake flour (minus 2 tsp. of flour) because it is more healthy.
