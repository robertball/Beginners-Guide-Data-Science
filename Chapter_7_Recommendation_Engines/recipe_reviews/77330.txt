Wow, these were sooo good. I skipped the icing and they turned out perfect. These chewy chocolate bars will be a family favorite.

Very good recipe if you make it right.  A little dry and crumbly.  First time I made it I accidently grabbed a brownie mix instead of cake mix.  Those are 5 stars, unbelievably good.

Everyone at work seemed to like them, but I didn't think they were fantastic.

Very easy and good - this makes me look like some kind of baking genius, but they aren't hard to make at all! Added skor toffee bits to the top prior to baking and omitted the icing.
