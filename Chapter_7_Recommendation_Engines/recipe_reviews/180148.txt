This turned out excellent! We didn't have any bacon on hand but it went along very well with some fried chicken. We did make one change and that was to add a half teaspoon of ranch seasoning (from the packet) into the powdered sugar and mix until homogenous. Again perfect!

First off kudos to the genius who stumbled upon this mana from heaven. I cooked up a batch of these last night to eat while i soaked my feet. I also added some Bacon salt to them to give them an extra kick. with this recipe there is almost no reason to goto denny's anymore. I wish i could make a pillow out of these so when i wake up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat i could eat some of my pillow to calm my nerves.

There is no leavening in this recipe to even make "bubbles" let alone rise and fluff. Pancakes are very very thick and heavy. Probably could use some baking soda powder or both. It's too bad because I do like the flavor combination.

Hmm. These are odd and bf did not like these at all. I'm a little confused by the directions abou thte batter being too runny...mine were very thick like muffin batter not like pancakes--maybe bc of the thickness of my ranch dressing? I forged ahead any way and made pancakes by spreading it out in the pan with my fingers. These are really sweet--you don't taste the ranch or bbq sauce much at all. Bf thought they were the consistency of funnel cake but was not impressed at all. I thought they were just too sweet and I didn't put any powdered sugar on these. I thought they were interesting and wanted to try; maybe I will make those funnel cakes instead next time by using sour cream and some other sauce instead of the bbq. Thanks for the recipe!

Brilliant!! I added wee little sausage chunks in the batter like you would blueberries for blueberry pancakes. I highly recommend that if you're not a bacon fan or if you really enjoy pork. Overall three words: A-MAZ-ING!!!

i just got done making this for dinner/snack. I tried it (hubby hurt his neck/back at work & went to bed early.) i followed the ingredients list added a few other things (some mayo baking soda & mt dew); the mt. dew mainly because the batter was too thick;; while tasting pretty good the cakes didnt hold up there shape well.. maybe i put too much batter in at 1 time to the fry pan...?? the taste was good just too thick batter...

I made it in a waffle maker because that was easier for me. When you make the batter it will be very thick so I added some water. It doesnâ€™t taste that good by it self so I recommend chicken and waffles.
