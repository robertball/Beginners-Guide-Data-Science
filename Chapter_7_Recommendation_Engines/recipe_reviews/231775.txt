I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper & Italian seasoning, cooked the chicken in the butter and oil for a few minutes and then added the onion, garlic and mushrooms. I didn't see the point in dirtying additional dishes. I served this over fresh spinach pasta with a crisp salad and garlic bread. BF loved this and has already requested that I make it again. I think some extra garlic and fresh basil would be a nice addition to this dish.

Needed something quick and easy, but different. We eat a LOT of chicken and even though there are gazillion recipes out there, it can sometimes get boring ;)
Followed recipe almost to a T...
Used chicken tenders b/c that is what I had in freezer; drained the diced tomatoes not thinking but glad that I did after reading note about sauce being too runny - it was perfect.
Also, was skeptical about adding red pepper flakes so late in the game but it added just the right kick. Added salt & pepper when I added the pasta.
This is a keeper in our house for sure - we loved it and I can't wait to have some of the leftovers today for lunch!

Liked the sauce a lot.  I did add a bit more wine than called for and also a few dashes of basil.  The only real complaint I have about the recipe is that the sauce was very thin and wouldn't stay with the pasta.  My daughter said we should have served it in a bowl.  I thought about thickening it, but then I opted not to as I thought scampi is usually a thin sauce I think.  I made a technical error and went with orcchiette pasta which was not a good match at all.  I wanted a different shape, but that was not a good one.  Loved the brightness the lemon adds to the sauce as its added at the end.

This was really good! I did not use mushrooms or pepper flakes and it was still really flavorful. The 2nd time I made it, I breaded & pan fried the chicken. Added a nice dimension, but took more time. Now I make it either way depending on how much time I have.

Love, love, love this recipe. I follow the recipe 99% but I do use boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts and serve over whole wheat angel hair. I love that it is easy to make with ingredients I generally have on hand and is ready in about 30 minutes. And, its even tastier as leftovers!

Everyone liked the recipe.  I did change some things.  I used B/S thighs, chicken broth and canned petite tomatoes with green chilies.  I also added a bit of cream and parmesan to the sauce and double the garlic.
