This is so delicious and goes  very well with tacos. It is easy to throw together, especially when you do like me and cheat by using ready rice. I left out the corn. Thank you for the recipe.

I made this with fajitas and it was very good, but I wasn't able to use fresh cilantro since the Meijer by my house was out, so I used the cilantro seasoning and although I didn't really like the texture, it tasted so good. I'm looking forward to making this again with the fresh cilantro.

Delicious! I made this to go in burritos and it was very good. Will make it again as a side dish. Would go well with bbqâ€™d chicken or salmon. Might have to double the recipe!

This was well liked by my family!  I omitted the corn, since I didn't have any mexican style & I add the zest from 1 lime.  Very good.

Its FIREEE!!!! I made this as a side dish for one of my meal plans that I got from this girl and her cilantro lime rice recipe look good but it was just the cilantro and rice and lime with no seasoning. I figure it will be bland so I tried to find another one and stumbled across this one. First time making it and it  was so good all the seasoning proportions are just right! I added a little bit more chili powder because I like things spicier but this is a keeper for sure

I was very surprised how moist the rice turned out.  I followed the recipe and didn't add anything extra. It was better than the bland rice we were used to.  My husband loved it.
