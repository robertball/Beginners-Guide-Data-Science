This is a fabulous quick Posole recipe. I have spent much more time and not had nearly as good results with other recipes. I did make a few alterations and additions however. I used one each large poblano and jalapeno pepper in place of the serrano, also added 4 med coarse chopped tomatilloes. Used 3c. chicken stock to 1c water and substituted masa flour  for corn meal by way of a slurry.  To pump up flavor a bit I added a splash of Maggi seasoning and 1 tsp. of New Mexico Chile Powder as well as a splash of  Tamari soy sauce to taste.  I did give this an additional 30 min cook time with the pork going in for the last 30. I cut  6 tortillas into 1/4" strips and fried them for a topper then served with  a dollop of Mex style sour cream, crumbled Queso Fresco and cilantro and lime for garnish.  Will make this again and again!  Happy cooking....

Pretty solid recipe. My only recommendation would be to add the pork in much later in the process (maybe 5 minutes before you are done) or else it ends up very overcooked.

I followed the recipe exactly except after cooking for 30 minutes I covered it and cooked it another 30 minutes.  This made the pork more tender.  Excellent recipe!  Even better warmed up as leftovers.  Thanks for the recipe!

I often have a craving for Posole soup, but have never found it on a Mexican restaurant menu. So have to fix it myself.
This is an excelent recipe, and easy to prepare. I did not have Serrano peppers in the garden, so substituted Jalapenos.

Very good. Only change I made was instead of corn meal I used 1/8 cup masa harana. Next time will add more hominy.

Can't make posole any easier than this, I did add some cumin to up the flavor profile a little. I liked the addition of cornmeal to make it a little thicker. The seniors loved this one

Yummy and Easy! I used only ingredients that I had in-house. I cooked a pork shoulder in the crock pot the night before. Substituted frozen corn for Hominy. Eliminated peppers, cornmeal and water. Added quartered mushrooms (just because I had them). Added pork at end. My 11 year old daughter enjoyed it!

I used green bell pepper instead of serrano so that my child would like it and ended up removing the only kick in the dish. It was delicious but a little bland because of the substitute. I overcame that by garnishing it with sour cream, shredded cabbage, and lime, and serving it with warm corn/flour tortillas.

I added more cumin and chicken broth, added some chili powder, substituted chilies for peppers, and added frozen corn as well as the hominy. Very tasty soup!
