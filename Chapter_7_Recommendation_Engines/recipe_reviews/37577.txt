This was delicious.  I altered it slightly and used about 3/4 tin of frozen lemonade instead of the mix.  I am always looking for ways to add fruit into my family's diet and this was great. Both my kids and my husband loved it.  It is a great drink for a hot day when served with BBQ.

Good, but not a great hit with the family.    We used Country Time lemonade and used four cups of water, 2 cups of ice (to chill it more)

this recipe was not anything to die for, it tasted more like strawberry cool-ade than lemonade... Sorry.

Excellent for a hot summer day. The kids thought this was a real treat.  This is a must for hot weather. It will cool you right down.

I used some strawberries that I had previously frozen with a little sugar...they were pretty juicy but I still used all 6 cups of water.  Just what I was craving on this hot day. Will be serving later with spicy Bronco Burgers (from this site) and possibly a little Bacardi!

A huge hit. Because we are diabetic, I used unsweetened Kool-Aid lemonade and Splenda.  Easy, quick and very refreshing.  Will definately make again.

It didn't have the flavor I liked. I had to add sugar, probaly because of the crystal light having no sugar. Next time, I will not use crystal light.

I used Raspberry Lemonade flavor -> beautiful color.  My DH did not like the taste; next time, I'll try 7 cups water, or use more ice cube; maybe add sugar.
