Absolutely delicious! Very easy and very quick, I needed something for a late night meal for me and my husband and this fit the bill! I cut the recipe and half and used "Taco Seasoning II" from this site to season the chicken first vs. adding it to the salsa and left out the lemon juice and garlic. I used Ortega's Medium chunky style salsa (a bit more than called for) and love the addition of black beans and chopped red pepper. After everything was layered I topped it with a light Mexican blend cheese. I then baked it at 375 for 45 minutes. Baking this at 400 for an hour and a half would result in some really dried out chicken. After it came out of the oven I dressed it up a bit by topping it off with some sliced black olives and thin sliced green onions.The chicken is tender, juicy and oh so good! It's perfect topped off with dollup of light sour cream and a side of Spanish rice - YUM!

This was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Yummy!! Don't bake for an hour and a half though. That's way too long. I baked for 35 minutes, but I only made 2 servings. I suggest 45 minutes for more servings. If you you bake too long, I'm afraid the beans will burn. I topped with some chopped green onions and served it with sour cream and over rice. This was a really good recipe. The chicken was nice and moist, and it's really a nice low-calorie recipe. I will for sure make again. Thanks.

My husband and kids loved this recipe! I added 1/2 an onion sauted, 1 can of sliced black olives, and 1 can of chopped green chilis.  I reduced the heat to 350 degrees  and baked for 1 hour.  I sprinkled on grated cheese for the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Yummy!

I tried this recipe last night and my family loved it! I did mix the beans with the salsa and spices as others suggested.  Also, omitted the pepper and added some onion. Other changes ~ baked it, covered, for an hour; then put a cup of crushed corn chips and about 1-1/2 cups shredded Mexican blend cheese on top - returned to the oven and baked, uncovered,  at 350 for 15 minutes.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks for an easy, delicious recipe!

Despite my faith in strong review power to determine the goodness of a recipe, I have to say this one was not really anything to write home about in and of its self. For chicken tenderness, 5. Easy of prep, 5. Directions, ?-not sure an hour and a half is necessary at 400. Has any one tried it this way? I did 350 for about 45 minutes. The flavor was just lacking. I think those who have dressed this up with sour cream, cheese, fresh tomatoes, a tortilla, corn chips, etc. are on the right track. I served over rice as suggested by recipe. I accidentally got some canned Mexi-corn on my fork with a mouthful, and went, "That's what this needs! Something to lighten it up!" It is just so heavy and dark. So...if you add these lighter, cooler items, it is a good recipe. But not spectacular.

Cooking boneless chicken breasts in a sauce in the oven really appeals to me.  Little chance of dryness.  However, a 400 degree oven caused the black beans to become a bit crunchy after an hour.  Next time I prepare this, I will bake at 350 degrees & add the black beans in with the salsa mixture.  I topped this dish with shredded muenster cheese & baked just until melted for the last few minutes.  Delicious even with the slight crunch.

This recipe is awesome. I did add some onions to the mixture and topped it with cheese the last five minutes of baking. To stop the beans from drying out I did like one other reviewer suggested, mixed the beans into the salsa mixture. Served with Pico de Gallo and brown rice. Also had it on a warm tortilla. Will definetly make again.

SUPERB!!! SUPERB!!! I made this receipe, and there will not be any leftovers!! Wonderful taste, texture, spice combination, and easy to prepare. After it had cooked, we cut the chicken into strips while it was still in the casserole dish and then put the chicken as well as some of the sauce and a little cheese in a tortilla, rolled it up and topped it with Sour Cream! YUMMMMMMYYYY!!! It was delicious, will totally make again! Thank you!

Very tasty!  A great way to get a high fibre meal into a very picky family!  I cut back the cumin to 1 tbsp. and at the very end of baking I topped it with some mozza cheese.  Will for sure be making again.

Made this for dinner last night and we loved it.  Nothing fancy here, but nice Mexican flavors.  I did cut back a bit on the cumin and chili powder and omitted the lemon juice – all due to personal preferences.  I did add taco seasoning to both the chicken and the salsa mixture.  I also added the black beans to the salsa mixture.  I agree with others that the baking time/temp are WAY OFF!!  I baked mine, covered at 350 for 30 minutes and they were perfectly cooked and still nice and moist.  I plated the chicken over saffron rice and drizzled a bit of the juice from the bottom of the baking dish over the top, just to moisten up the appearance of the salsa.  Then I sprinkled it with shredded cheddar, which just began to melt from the residual heat in the chicken.  I sprinkled it with green onions for color, and served it with some shredded lettuce and sour cream.  Pretty!  Delicious!  And very, very filling!  Oh, and I forgot to mention – really easy!

Super easy and delicious.  I made just 2 breast, so I really cut down on the other ingredients.  I didn't have any bell pepper so I skipped it, and I didn't have quite enough salsa so I added some taco sauce.  I baked at 375 for about 50 minutes and then added some cheddar slices and baked uncovered for another 5-10 minutes.  The chicken was moist and tasty and the beans and sauce were great over rice.  Will make again!

Fantastic! I scaled the recipe by half, mixed the beans in with the salsa mixture like other reviewers and baked at 400 for one hour. Turned out great. Topped with a little shredded sharp cheddar and served with sour cream. With Spanish style microwave in the pouch rice, this tasty meal took vey little effort. Will be making again.

Wow! This was wonderful. I actually made this on the stovetop because it was way too hot to turn the oven on. I used cumin seed (all I had) and sprinkled on one side of each breast lightly, followed with lemon juice. Sat for about 5 minutes, while I sauteed the onion garlic and bell pepper. added the breasts spice side down, seared and then flipped. Added everything else to pan, covered, turned the heat down to med-low and cooked for about 20-25 minutes. The man said he could smell if from the street. I will make this again, but I will wait to turn the stove on!

Added a bit of cheddar cheese in the last few minutes of cooking and finished with a bit of sour cream at plating.

As others have said, 1-1.5 hr of cooking is way too much.  Cooking that long drys out the chicken and beans.  I reduced to cooking time to 45 minutes.

I love this dish, and often get requests for the recipe! It changes a little every time I make it based on the vegetables that I have available. As in other reviews, I mix the black beans in with the salsa so that they do not dry out. In addition, I keep a close watch on the chicken when it is in the oven so that is does not get overcooked.  Overall, a great recipe!

Filleted the chicken breast to cook faster, sprinkled a little bit of low-sodium taco seasoning on each side of the chicken, mixed 3/4 can of black beans with the salsa mixture, kept the lemon (it gave it some zip) and added the last of the black beans on top of the salsa mixture.  Cooked on 350 for 40 minutes, sprinkled a very small amount of cheese on each chicken breast.  Awesome dinner!

This was very good.  Changes I made were mixing the black beans with the salsa, etc. and browning chicken tenders beforehand and changing bake time accordingly.  Four of us liked it a lot.  Picky #5 liked the chicken, but not the beans.  I served with grated Mexican cheese on the side, and with quinoa as a side dish.  Healthy, low-fat, high protein, high fiber and gluten free.  It would have been really fast and easy if I hadn't browned the chicken beforehand.  I think next time I'll leave that step out.

I was surprised at how GOOD this was! I was just looking for something quick and easy with little fuss to make for dinner and was shocked at the wonderful flavor! I used 4 large chicken breast halves. I sauted onion and green pepper and mixed with the salsa, also mixed the black beans in. I only used one Tbsp of cumin and one can of black beans and it was plenty. I baked it for 1 hour at 350. Then I shreded the chicken and mixed it in with the sauce. I served it with rice. Would be amazing in tortillas this way. Thanks for a great recipe! :)

5 stars because my boyfriend, who isn't a chicken fan like I am, loved it and it is so easy! I added sauteed onions and traded the salsa for a can of rotel.  I also forgot to drain and rinse the beans and it still turned out great.  Served w/ brown rice and enjoyed every last bite!

I followed this recipe exactly and cooked it for 9 hours on low in the slow cooker.  I really, really enjoyed it!  The chicken came out tender and moist, which can not always be said when a slow cooker is used.  My husband also really enjoyed this recipe, and he can be quite critical at times.  Will definitely make again!

This was delicious and super easy to make!!   I too made changes like many others. I mixed the beans with the salsa mixture.  Baked it uncovered at 350 for 1 hour. I sprinkled finely shredded Monterey jack and Colby cheese and chopped green onions  on top and baked until cheese was melted.  No other changes.   I served it with white jasmine rice.  So easy.  I think this could be an excellent dish for Sunday football parties.

Simple, healthy and easily reduced for two people. I used a can of diced tomatoes and green chilies since I had no salsa, added in some diced sweet onion. I did marinate my chicken breast in the sauce for several hours before baking. I also reduced the amount of chili and cumin to our taste, added in some Mexican oregano. I baked for 50 min. at 375°, topped with some colby jack, chopped garden kale and sour cream. We will be making this one again.

Mexican Chicken I Haiku: "Timing's a bit off. (If followed, would be too dry.) Otherwise, it's great!" I can't imagine baking chicken for 1+ hour at 400 deg; I did mine at 350 for just under an hour, and it was still slightly over-done, but not so much that it was inedible. All the tasty juice and moisture from the bean mixture (which, incidentally, I combined w/ the salsa, per other reviews) kept the chicken mighty tasty. My one complaint was the lemon juice - I didn't think it jived w/ the cumin and other flavors, so next time, I'd omit it all-together. I served my chicken w/ tortilla chips and cheese/sour cream/green onions for dressing up. Nummy num.

Good chicken but it didn't 'wow' me. I thought it was average. I thought it tasted more like chili than a mexican dish. I followed the recipe exactly except I only used 1/2 the amount of black beans. I thought one can was more than enough. Not sure if this will be in our regular meal rotation.

Super recipe, yummy and easy. I agree with other reviewers that the temp and duration would be way too hot for way too long. I grow my own cilantro so I also added some of that for a bright taste. I of couse like everything I eat to be super spicy hot so I added cayenne. I used reduced fat cheese to make it a bit healthier, overall a great healthy dish. Easy for any night of the week!! Thanks for the recipe!

Great flavor! I forgot to add the red bell pepper and I actually kept the black beans separate and didn't add the cheese. It was very good!

I tweaked this recipe a bit trying to be creative and it was fantastic!! First I only had skinless drumsticks and green bell pepper on hand, I didnt drain the beans and used more salsa than the recipe called for because I wanted to add rice. So I baked for 45 mins, then added a few small handfuls of rice,baked another 25,let steam with the foil on and out came a tex mex chix,rice,and beans dish :) Will definitly make this again.

Made as prescribed and I thought it was tasteless. I see someone added taco seasoning and that probably would help.

I made very few modifications to this recipe.  I cut the chicken into cubes.  I didnt have fresh peppers so I used a cup of frozen diced green peppers.  I also, didnt have lemon juice so I used a lime.  I squeezed it onto the chicken before adding the salsa mixture.  I added the beans on top for the last 30 min of cooking only.  Not sure why others are coming out dry.  I cooked it for an hour at 350 and it was really juicy.  It was even better reheated the next day.

I followed Jillian's advice and baked at 375 for 45 minutes; I agree that any higher temp would make it dry out. However, if you're going to put cheese on top like she does, wait and do so during the last 10 minutes. It gets dried out and crusty if you put it on there from the beginning (unless you cover it with foil). I'm not a huge fan of jarred salsa, so I diced up a can of stewed tomatoes, some onion, and some garlic. It was good. Served it with a pot of Spicy saffron rice, sour cream and hot sauce. This dish isn't spectacular, but it gets the weeknight dinner job done with you're just looking for something relatively easy.

4 stars with the exact recipe, however I did change the cooking time. I reduced over temp to 350, and baked 3 servings for one hour. 5 stars with this minor change. Sooo good, and hubby enjoyed too. This is a keeper!

Pretty good, but not great.  Like a previous reviewer said, it seemed a bit heavy, and also seemed like slightly too much cumin to me.  Next time, I will add corn, use slightly less cumin, and perhaps use chicken thighs rather than chicken breasts, for more tender chicken.  However, this was a very easy and pretty tasty recipe, and used mostly very common ingredients, so it gets four stars from me.  I baked it at 375 for 50 minutes, and that seemed to be just perfect.

This is excellent.  I made the recipe exactly.  I baked the chicken at 400 degrees for 1-1/2 hours.  My baking dish was covered with foil.  The chicken was tender and the beans did not burn.  I made this 2x with excellent results.  I did uncover and top with cheddar cheese last 10 minutes.  Served with Mexican rice and sour cream.  Nice and easy.

This recipe was a family hit!  I dipped the chicken pieces in flour and sauteed in olive oil, w/ the onion, garlic and bell pepper first to keep it moist, and then only baked whole mixture with rest of ingredients  for about an hour.... it was delish!  I served it over a bed of white rice and corn on the cob.  I will share this and definitely make it again!!

I was in a rush tonight for dinner and so I used Goya Adobo with pepper and covered the chicken (enough to taste) and added the salsa and the beans.  Cooked until the chicken was ready and it was so good!!!

Delicious, easy and healthy dish! The first time I made this, I cooked some rice separately to go along with it. The next time, I tried adding instant brown rice and water to the sauce and baking it altogether. It was a hot mess...dried everything out, including the beans. Just goes to show you, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." The recipe is perfect as is, seasoning and all. Just make rice on the side to serve with it, because it has a lot of sauce.

My chicken normally comes out dry but this was so moist!  I didn't have any red peppers or chili powder, but this was still really good.  And best of all, it was really easy!  I'm giving 4 star because I don't love chicken, but I'd definitely make again.

Fabulous recipe!  Only addition was adding cheese to the top the last 5 minutes of cook time.  I cooked at 350' for one hour and that was plenty of cook time.  Wonderful flavor and super easy. Thanks for a great recipe.

Amazing! My boyfriend and I tried this about 2 months ago and I make it probably once every two weeks.  I tweaked it because I don't usually have black beans so we use corn instead.  Over rice with some shredded cheese and sour creams it's amazing!

Great blend of flavors.  2-3 tablespoons of fresh cilantro really adds a lot to this.

Any recipe that makes me look like a good cook is most welcome, since I am a rookie.  This was tasty.

Great and tasty recipe! I travel for work and like recipes that I can make ahead of time and let my wife put in the oven to have a quick, healthy meal. This totally fit that bill. Easy for me to make, enough to feed the family, and plenty of taste for them as well. We added a little bit of cheese at the end to give it a little extra flavor and served Spanish rice on the side. Kids and wife loved it.

Was disappointed I made the recipe exactly as written but the end result was very bland. I actually threw 1/2 my plate away which is very rare. My husband did eat leftovers the next day and added cheese and he said it was somewhat better.

One of my family's favorite recipes!!! I make this exactly as it says and it turns out perfect every time. The chicken just falls apart. I use Pace brand salsa and I sometimes add a small bag of frozen corn on top with the black beans. There are so many ways of serving it. Stuff it in a tortilla or on top of rice or chips. It's so easy and you will love it!! ??

My whole family found it delicious! The chicken turns out flavorful and juicy. I used this recipe for 4 medium sized chicken breasts, and baked it for 40 minutes. It was plenty of time. The minor modifications I made were adding 1/3 c. of finely chopped onion, lime juice instead of lemon, and 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro. As another reviewer recommended, I added a big handful of cheddar-jack cheese.

We really enjoyed this recipe!  It was delicious and easy.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and decreased the baking time.  I halved the recipe and baked the chicken for 40 minutes.  It was really tasty!!  Also, next time, I will mix the black beans into the salsa mixture so the black beans don't seem a bit dried out.  Thank you for sharing!!

I changed this recipe quite a bit after reading the reviews and what others added or subtracted. I cut the cumin & chili to 1 tablespoon each and just 1 can of beans. I added chopped jalepeno,chopped onion & sliced olives. I cut the chicken in bite size cubes and simmered it for a few hours in my electric skillet. It turned out good, the chicken was very tender. I served it over rice with sour cream on top. Next time will grate some cheese to add on top also. My husband is not crazy about chicken & he even said it was good.

Fixed for my hubby who is diabetic, but a group of us ate it. Everyone loved it! Served with plain brown rice. Excellent meal even for non diabetic eaters! This recipe is a keeper! Hubby says plenty of flavor!

Don't bake for so long. I baked this for 45 min covered at 375 (as suggested by others) and then uncovered, sprinkled mexican blend cheese on the top and baked for another 10 min uncovered.

My family loved this recipe.  Chicken was very tender but I cut the baking time to 45 min. at 375 since the chicken breasts were not very thick.  I would use less cumin & chili powder next time.  A very quick meal with lots of protein!

I thought this was pretty good.  And super easy too!  It took me longer to make, but that's bc I had to cook the beans.  I thought I had canned black beans, but no.  I did, however, have dried black beans so I cooked them in the crockpot on high until they were done, which is what took so long!  Since I didn't have a can I just added beans until it looked right.  I did halve the topping and used 4 pieces of chicken--I'm very glad I did as it would've been too much otherwise.  Thanks for the recipe!

This dish was super easy and delicious!  I made the black beans per the best black beans recipe on this site before adding them on top.  This gave the dish a scrumptious bonus! I also added cheddar cheese!  Yum!

Nothing special it's just chicken topped with salsa. I was looking for a quick delicious recipe for chicken breast I had in the fridge. This was quick and very easy to make but tasted just ok. I added a little oregeno and cayenne pepper to the salsa mix then once the chicken was done I topped it off with cilantro. I won't be making this again.

Very good and super easy.  Top with cheddar cheese and sour cream and it's excellent!  I cooked it at 375 for 45 mins. and it was already getting too dry... definitely DO NOT do the recommended 400 for 1-1.5 hrs.  Halved the spices and it was still a bit spicy for my weak tastes.  ;)  Will make again!

Not bad! Per another reviewer, I sauteed the veggies on the stove, seared the chicken with cumin and chili pepper, then added everything else. Completely forgot about the lemon! I added cheddar cheese and fresh cilantro, and served it over rice for a complete meal. Easy, tasty, and filling!

This was a very simple and very tasty dish. I had some chicken thighs on hand so used those instead. Reduced the heating time and temperature as others suggested since I was cooking for only one. Such good flavors! Will definitely make this again.

Great recipe!  I absolutely loved it.  I would add, however, tomatoes and onions next time.  I made half the recipe and used 1/2 red pepper.  Even for 1/2 recipe, I should've used the whole pepper.  I made some brown rice with it as well.  Delicious!  The cumin and chili powder make it so tasty, along with the black beans.  I'd love to keep it low fat, but adding some sour cream on the side is even better.

Really enjoyed this.  Used boneless, skinless thighs and breasts and they were perfect after one hour.  Added a little cheese on the top at 45 minutes. Will make again.

It wasn't bad, but probably not something I'd make again. There was a little bit of a bitter aftertaste, but the chicken was very moist and juicy. I had to add salt and pepper when it was on my plate because it was too bland otherwise. 

I pretty much stuck to the recipe although I did use only 1.5 tablespoons of chili powder because not everyone eating it likes things spicy. I also added about a half cup of cilantro, which may have been too much. If I made it over again I'd only use a 1/4 cup as that may have been where the bitter taste was coming from. I also melted some cheddar cheese on top the last 10 minutes. It baked in about an hour for me.

I love this recipe!  The only thing I change is that I use 2 teaspoons each of ground cumin and chili powder (as opposed to 2 tablespoons).  I also mix the beans in with the salsa mixture to prevent from drying.  I cover the casserole dish with aluminum foil and bake for 1.5 hours.

I loved this but my husband hated it so I'll average it as a 3. I suspect it was the flavor of the lemon and cumin that he disliked as they were very present, so next time I will either reduce or eliminate those ingredients and see if he likes that better. I cut this down to make only 2 chicken breasts for the 2 of us (400 degrees for about 30 min.) and followed the directions basically to the letter though I subbed garlic powder for crushed. I added the black beans at 15 minutes and next time would add them with 5 or 10 minutes left as they got just a smidge dried out, though they were still delicious. Served with steamed rice.  I loved how simple this was. The chicken was VERY moist and I loved the little shock of lemon. I thought the flavors were great and the way it all mixed together was fun and tasty. I love black beans and this was a great, cheese-free way to have Mexican food. Again, this would have been a 4 or 5 star recipe if my husband had liked it too, but I will have to make some changes if I'm going to add this to our rotation.

This was easy and very delish...I ate it alone one day, put it over romaine lettuce the next day and then the last day I diced it up and rolled into flour tortillas with some cheese and microwaved.  Loved it!

Really easy and good.  I halved it and baked it covered at 400 for 1 hr.  The chicken was tender enough to shred if I'd wanted to.  I may try to combine with my mexican rice recipe to make a one dish casserole.

I halved the recipe but otherwise followed it exactly.  I cooked it for 1 hour but had to go somewhere, so I turned the oven off and left it in.  When I returned, I shredded the chicken, which was extremely tender, mixed it all up, and served it in tortillas.  While it was extremely easy to throw together, it was just average.  But average is ok in my book.

Really tasty! I used it for tacos. Wrapped it up in some corn tortillas with some light sour cream, small amount of cheese, diced jalepenos and some lettuce!  I live alone, so I cut the recipe in half and had enough for about three and a half or four meals. Great for a beginner or verteran. All around easy!

I made these with chicken breast tenders, so it cooked fairly quickly.  I didn't have any cumin, but I used a few squirts of fresh mexican seasoning in a tube and also added a bit of chopped onion.  Very good and excellent way to use black beans.  Thanks for sharing!

This was pretty good.  I didn't have quite enough salsa and substituted Rotel to make up the difference.  This has a lot of flavor!  I served it over rice and we'll be having it again.

Holy Cow!!  That is some yummy chicken.  I had Safeway Select Southwestern Style Salsa on hand and added a can of red enchilada sauce.  I didn't have any red peppers, but it was so good anyway.  This will become a part of the regular rotation for sure. High protein, low fat, deliciouso!!

Delicious and so easy!  I added a box of frozen corn, which it didn't need...we just like corn.  My chicken was done in just under 1 hour.  So tasty.  Served with Royal Blend long-grained wild, brown, red and white rice.  Yummy!  Thanks for sharing!

Mine didn't take an hour and a half to cook, only about an hour.  The first time I used regular salsa and it was good, but the second time I used a much chunkier salsa and it was much better!  I served over egg noodles and topped each plate with sour cream and a little Monterrey jack cheese.

This is a good, easy and nutritious dish.  I sub a can of rotel for the salsa, and mix the beans in with everything else and pour that over the chicken.  I put sliced munster or jack cheese over the chicken the last few minutes of cooking, and serve with sour cream and fresh cilantro.  Yum!  A meal all in itself with very little effort.

Thank you for posting the recipe! This was excellent as is per your directions. Served over rice and it was yummy! I don't think cheese or sour cream is necessary, as others have posted that they added. Then again, to each his own. The cumin is the key to this dish. I did, however, mix the beans with salsa and spice mixture, then pour over the chicken. Also, covered with foil for 1 hr to avoid beans from drying out. Very tasty. Will definitely make again.

Yummy!  Great for leftovers.  I do mix the beans in the salsa mix and sub in a can of white kidney beans for one of the cans of black beans.  And sour cream and melted cheese makes it really good.

Amazing!  Also added fresh corn to recipe...adds a little crunch.  After dish was finished I also squeezed fresh lime over it, a dollup of sour cream and sliced fresh avocado.  Also topped with a little grated cheddar cheese.  Delish!!

Wow, this the Da Bomb!  Good enough for any restaurant to serve.  It occurred to me that Lime juice might match the dish's flavors a bit better than Lemon juice though.  Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of 50 min @ 375, then uncovering and going another 10 min as others suggested.

I was concerned that this would dry out during the cooking process but there is enough liquid in the salsa to keep it moist. I omitted the seasonings and just made it a little easier and used a packet of taco seasoning. I used half the saesoning directly on the chicken and the rest I mixed with the salsa. I used 1 can of beans and used frozen corn in place of the other can. I also added a bit of cheese! This was very tasty!

I thought this was good.  I will add more beans next time as I only used one can.  This has a very strong cumin flavor - might reduce slightly next time. I only used 1 tbsp. of chili powder as I was afraid I would make it to spicy for my kids.  I also added cheese at the end.  I would recommend this recipe.

A quick, healthy, easy dinner that tastes good! My husband and daughter both liked it and went back for seconds so I'd say it's a keeper!  I used red and yellow peppers and topped with cheese. I would also recommend stirring the beans into the salsa mix so they don't dry out and cooking with the lid off half the time, the sauce was very watery.

It was alright but not rave worthy.  If I make it again I would use less cumin.  It overpowered the rest of the flavors.  I guess it will all depend on how the left overs are.

I did not have olives and it still came out great.  The last 5-10 minutes before taking out of the oven, I added shredded monterey jack and cheddar cheese over the chicken.  Will make again with the olives and cheese.

This was awesome and easy.  As I do like things spicy I added two chopped Jalapenos (with seeds) and it turned out great.  I also cheated and uncovered it the last 10 minutes of cooking and topped with 3/4 of a cup of shredded cheese.

I make the recipe as is but also add sliced black olives and sliced onion and sliced red pepper. Chicken come out very tender and flavorful.  I serve it with yellow rice, corn and tortilla chip.

This so basic and easy, you can tweak it.  The lemon (or lime) is important to add some acidity along with the tomato to help tenderize the chicken  I made my own salsa with onion, green and red pepper, garlic, corn and fresh Romano and leftover whole canned tomatoes.  And I added lots of cilantro and some oregano. I let this sit and marinate for a bit before baking, and it didn't take as long as 1.5 hours --at 375 for about 50 minutes. Yum.  This is a keeper for a quickie with guests, too.

Very tasty!!  Baked it at 375 for about 55 minutes.  Added mozarella cheese on the top after pulling it out of the oven.  Next time will add Mexican blend shredded cheese in last 10 minutes.  Great dish!

I truly loved this. . . What I did different was to use 1 tablespoon of chili powder (instead of 2), and 1 tablespoon of cumin (instead of 2).  Prior to topping the dish with the beans, I added a small can of sliced black olives which I drained.  I baked the dish at 350 for 1 1/2 hours covered with aluminum foil, I took off the foil and baked for 10 more minutes.  I marinated the chicken breast the night before, just to bump up the chicken flavor.  Put a teaspoon of sour cream on top of the dish for that added taste!

Excellent!! A keeper!!  Made as stated but was short on salsa (mild) so added some fresh tomato, 1/2 jalapeno and 3 or 4 springs of cilantro.  Was ready in 1 hour.  Served over rice with some cubed avocado.  Don't forget to spoon the sauce over your chicken and rice...SO, SO GOOD!!

Not bad. I followed the cooking time recommended by the reviews and the chicken turned out great. I also seasoned the chicken with taco seasoning II, adding some of the same seasoning to the salsa. I also mixed in a can of black beans and corn with the salsa. I topped it with cilantro at the end and served it with Mexican rice. 

I'll probably make it again when I'm too rushed to make something better for dinner.

this was very, very good WITH my modifications:
- i used boneless, skinless chicken thighs to ensure the meat was moist and tender. i braised them in EVOO with cumin, cayenne, black pepper, garlic and saizon - which adds a wonderful color to braised meats.
- i also added a can of corn to the black  beans to add more color to the final meal.
- once the meat was braised, i added red wine to scrape the drippings.
- i also added a can of dice tomatoes to the beans and corn and seasoned them to taste in a saucepan. they key is to keep tasting this and add whatever feels and tastes good@
- placed the skillet in the oven until juices ran clear then added shredded mozz on top of chicken, then layered corn, beans and tomatoes.

long, short, i revised this dish a great deal. i eat with my eyes and nose, followed by my mouth.

I was looking for a good black bean recipe and I stumbled upon this one, it exceeded my expectations! I've never been able to cook such tender, juicy chicken breast until this dish came along.
The only alteration I made was instead of using a jar of salsa, I diced up fresh roma tomatoes and added sauteed onions. I followed people's advice of mixing in the black bean with my tomato/onion. 
I topped the dish off with brown rice and a side salad. A wonderful, low fat and fulfilling dinner!

Delicioso! I used white corn salsa, black beans, chili powder, minced garlic, black pepper, and lime juice. I didn't use any measurements, just a discerning eye. I baked the chicken at 350 degrees for 1 hour. At the end of that hour, I rough chopped some cilantro, sprinkled that onto the chicken then covered with a Mexican blended shredded cheese. Served everything on top of a bed of yellow rice. Turned out perfect on the first try!

Wow.  I really liked this.  Not too spicy, but very flavorful.  I only used 4 chicken breasts, so I also only used 1 can of beans, and that was plenty.  One of my kids, who enjoys spicy foods, really liked this.  The other two only ate a few bites, so it may not be all that kid friendly.  My husband actually cut up the chicken, mixed it with the beans, salsa, and rice that I had made and ate it rolled in a tortilla.  Versatile, easy and a great dinner!

I thought this was really good, but my son thought it was lacking flavor.  He rated it a 3 and I rated it a 5 so it gets a 4 rating.  I added a mexican cheese blend the last 5 minutes of cooking.

This was one of my favorites. Cynjne was skeptical though because of the beans, but as it turns out she really liked it. We love cumin spiced dishes. She thought the adding salsa was a great idea and combined with the cumin she was willing to try it. In the end she really liked the beans in the dish. I used No Name brand medium salsa from the local store(Food Basics). Did not have enough time to make our own salsa from scratch, nor did we have everything needed. Definite, definite repeat. If you like chicken, you will like this I am sure.

We love the recipe, but I only gave it 4 stars because 1 1/2 hours is too long.  I've made the recipe as is, but then have changed it a few time.  We use a chunky salsa and mix the beans in with the salsa mixture.  We also add corn - it add some great color and is also yummy.

Great tasting recipe that can easily be scaled down for a 2 person meal.  I took the advice of others and only cooked this dish for 1 hour at 350.  Will definitely make this dish again.

This was an easy and flavorful recipe.   The chicken stayed moist, it had a nice texture... my boyfriend and I loved it!  I added some green onions to the mix as well as had some sour cream on the side.  I was only making a serving for 2 so I cooked it at 350 for about 40 minutes

This was really good! I mixed the beans in with the rest of the ingredients and added some chopped onion.  I only baked it for 1 hour.  I served with sour cream.  It was delicious!

Yum.  I make this a lot because it's healthy and I keep the ingredients on hand. Even my kids love it.  They call it "Power Chicken."  We stir the beans into the salsa.  Excellent recipe.  Thank you.

This was one of the best dishes I've ever made!  I too mixed the beans in with the salsa.  Next time I'll add an onion probably.  But two big thumbs up for sure!

This was awesome!!! I put this in the crockpot, shredded the chicken and put it in tortilla shells with cheese and sour cream. Had it by itself the next 2 days at work for lunch and it just gets better!  Highly recommended!

This is sooo good and sooooo easy to make! I added colby jack cheese in the last 5 minutes to melt all over and ate with crunchy tostadas! I cooked a 2 serving portion at 400 degrees for an hour and it came out PERFECT!!!!! Can't wait to tell everyone about this recipe!

I've made this recipe twice and the chicken comes out so moist.  1 hour cooking time has worked well for me.  It's a big family favorite.  We serve it with a small sprinkle of sharp cheddar cheese and a dollop of guacamole.  Yummy!

This recipe was awesome!  I didn't have red pepper so I just left it out and I also halved the recipe.  Turned out great!  I pounded my chicken breasts and reduced the cook time to around 35 minutes.

This was quick, easy and tasted great!  I added onions and used green pepper instead b/c that's what I had on hand.  I also topped with a little cheese during the last few minutes. I served over rice and topped with a dollop of sour cream! We really enjoyed it.  I will certainly make this again!

Yum!  I have made this several times for my husband and myself, and it has become one of our favorites.  It's a very filling meal when served with salad and rice.  The flavor is wonderful and the chicken is always nice and moist.

This was one of those recipes that everyone liked well enough, but didn't rave about enough for me to make again.  A nice change though.  The sauce was really nice spooned over Mexican Rice.

Who would have thought adding additional spices to already made salsa would turn out so great! I didn't have chicken breast so I used thighs & drumsticks and added a little more garlic. I only cooked it for 1hr took of the lid added some cheese and baked (top off) for another 10min. Came out nice and moist!! This one is a keeper.

Did half the recipe, and baked at 375 for 50 min.  That may have been too long because the beans had dried out a bit (though still tasted good).  Next time will not cook as long.  Great with a little bit of sour cream or feta cheese on top!

I thought this was really great,  but a little spicy.  I will have to cut back on the chili powder as it was too spicy for my children.  This one is a keeper, and so different.

We loved this receipe. Next time we make it we will add a can of corn, pinto beans and rice to the dish. This was a fabulously quick meal. I am excited about adding this meal to my rotation. We too, like others suggested, added our black beans into the salsa mixture. It was great as it was but next time we will make the slight modifications mentioned above. Thanks You! Thank You! For this recipe.

This was very delicious! I added a few tablespoons of sour cream and melted some cheese on top at the end. It was very tasty, and my husband kept commenting on how good it was and asking when it would be done.

However, the cook time of 1 to 1 1/2 hours on 400 degress seems excessive. I only cooked it about 25-30 minutes, and it was done. Some of the beans were burning by the end.

Made this exactly as written except I mixed the beans in with the rest of the mixture and it turned out to be SOO GOOD! The chicken was very moist!
I served it with a Spanish Rice mix and tortilla chips... YUM!

Wow was this good! I tweaked this a little: I had a half a packet of taco seasoning that need to get used up so I used that rather than the seasoning listed. That gave it a good flavor without being too spicy for the kids.  I had 2 very large chicken breasts so I filleted them and that reduced the cooking time to about 1/2 hour. I also added a small cup of pineapple tidbits w/ a little of the juice.  This was so good served with Vigo saffron rice, a little sour cream on top garnished with chopped green onions.  My 6 yr old loved it but picked off the beans and my 3 year wouldn't touch it. The leftovers made a great lunch today!

This is delicious and so incredibly easy! As others suggested, I put the beans in with the mixture and they came out great. I added onion to make it like a fajita chicken and served with rice and tortillas. I baked 4 large breasts for 1 hour at 375 degrees and that was sufficient.
I have also halved the spices and salsa for the children I nanny (who are picky eaters) and it was a big hit with them.

This will definitely be one of my regulars.

This was great!  I used a roaster chicken and pinto beans instead of black. I also cooked the rice right in the 9x13 dish. Reading the other reviews helped and I lowered the temp on the oven to 375 degrees. I also checked it periodically and stirred the beans and rice. We will surely eat this one again!

This was excellent! I added chopped onion, and used only 1TBS of cumin and chili powder.  I used pineapple sala (newmans own) and this was great!  Make sure you use a salsa you like and this will turn out well.

I tried this recipe and all enjoyed it.  I however like colorfull foods so I substituted one of the cans of blackbeans for pinto beans.  It added nice color and texture.  I also did like others and mixed the beans with the salsa and added 1/4 cup of water.  It kept everything moist and by the time it was done baking, the beans had abborbed the water, so that they were tender and not dry.  I served it with jicima sticks, and a rice pilaf of lime,diced jalapeno, green onion and fresh cilantro.  One of my guests asked for the recipe and wants to try this dish on top of a bed of lettuce greens with vegetables for a "type of a taco salad"  Thanks, hope this review is helpfull to you as other reveiws have been have been for me.

If I hadn't made so many Mexican recipes I might have thought more of this, but I've had much better.  Not that this was bad -- in fact, I've made it twice.  The first time I didn't have enough salsa and substituted some taco sauce, which was stronger and I had to cut back on it -- I blamed the dryness on this and made sure the 2nd time that I had enough salsa.  Nope.  Had I read the other reviews first I would have realized it's just like this and the beans need mixed in.  As one person said, just missing something -- not sure what.

After reading the reviews for this recipe, I too cut back on the cumin. Way back. I also mixed the beans with the salsa. I liked the recipe but the rest of the family did not. 30 minutes is just a tad too long in the oven at that temperature, even for thicker breasts. At 30 minutes my chicken was too dry.

Easy and tasty.  Next time, I will add crushed corn chips and cheese on top a few minutes before taking it out of the oven.

This was absolutely delicious. I will make this again and again. I served it with Spanish rice and tortillas. It was a big hit.

This is an excellent dish.  I reduced the temperature to 350 degrees.  I served this with fresh guacamole, and it was delicious.  Would also be good in tortillas as others suggested.

I pounded the chicken breasts really thin, which sped up the cooking time.  I also mixed the beans in with the salsa mixture and had no trouble with dryness/crunchiness.  Great dish!

This was very tasty.  I had to add some onion, just out of personal preference, but this is something I will be making again and again.  Also, it is yummy topped with cheese, and some sour cream.  Next time I will also garnish with cilantro.

I made it again and added fresh mushrooms and it was even better.

I cut this recipe way down for one and use boneless, skinless chicken thighs.  It is terrific served over rice.  It is now in my rotation and I have 1 thigh for dinner and the second to pack for lunch.

I thought it was ok but my husband loved it.  Thus the four stars.  Not a big fan of cumin so I decreased cumin to 1/2 Tbsp and added 1/2 Tbsp oregano.  Did not add the green pepper just to minimize my children’s whining.  Served over brown rice and topped with sour cream, cheese, green onions, and fresh pico de Gallo. Bonus points to this recipe for being GF and DF.

This was great and easy to make. My kiddos loved it. I definitely only put it in the oven for 45 minutes; that was the perfect time. Perfect for those nights you need to make something fairly quickly. Prep time on this is maybe 5-10 minutes.

I did make changes. I used fired roasted red pepper canned tomatoes by hunts because I had no salsa and I put cheese ( Mexican blend on to). My husband loved it. I loved it. Delicious although would have been healthier without the cheese.

It was a decision on a whim to go for a picnic and that was the easiest and quickest to do in a rush of half an hour.  Everyone loved it but ended with one word "too spicy".  Next time less in hot pepper.

I used 3 large chicken breast halves cut in half longways to cut the cook time to 40 min (could have been 35min probably, it was a little dry). I also mixed the black beans in with the salsa mixture. This dish tastes a lot like chili. It wasn’t spicy at all so if you like spicy, kick it up a notch with your favorite hot sauce or some cayenne. I will add onion next time, and maybe top it with some sour cream.

I am not a cook by any means, but this recipe was ridiculously easy to follow and it turned out amazing! I only made it for myself so I cut the recipe down significantly, but this is such an easy recipe that it's easy to judge how much of the topping you want on your chicken. I will definitely be making this again!

My review posted in error. I am a great cook. Thought this would be great. The salsa mixture was spot on. But cooking with chicken it was terrible. Sorry for the bad review but have removed from my favorites and family asked never to make again. I am shocked at the five star reviews on this recipe- sorry but my family has higher standards for what is good.

I cut the recipe in half, doubled the salsa and only 1/2 a tbs of chili powder (my wife hates spicy) the rest was history (or historical).

I made this using Smokey Chipotle Salsa because it was what was in my cupboard.  Because of this, I didn't add the cumin or chili powder as I thought that might a bit much.  It came our great and my guests really liked it.   This recipe has a lot of wiggle room so it is easy to "make your own".   I served it with a green salad with an avacado type dressing topped with pepitas, and warmed tortillas to catch all the extras...

This is one of the rare healthy and low-fat meals that is delicious and so easy to make.  The only  changes I made  were:   1 Tablespoon each of the cumin and chili powder and only 1 can of black beans.  While baking, the beans  started looking dried out, so I stirred them into the salsa a little.  It baked for about one hour and it was  served over jasmine rice.    My husband and I both loved it and can't wait to make it again.

This was excellent.  It is easy, fairly quick to get into the slow cooker, and NO CHEESE!  Easy clean-up too.  I don't dislike cheese but this has none so it is good for those who can't have dairy products.  I will make this again soon!

I made this recipe exactly as stated with the exception of the time: 50 minutes and added shredded goat cheese (personal preference) uncovered, with about 5 minutes remaining.  You could probably cut back the beans somewhat but the end result was amazing!  Definitely make this a regular dish in our house!

This was so easy & yummy! I added shredded Mexican cheese on top of chicken and finely diced one fresh jalapeño and mixed in with medium salsa. I like the extra kick & hot salsa too much for my boyfriend. Served with brown rice on the side. Absolutely will make again!

I made this for my grandson’s Birthday party, and everyone loved it!  I did add shredded cheddar cheese and Doritos, though, which only improved it.  Next time I will lower the temp to 350 degrees and mix the beans with the salsa.

This was really good. I only had one can of black beans, though. I also used only approx. 2.5 pound pack of chicken breast, sliced up. The only thing I'd change is that I used bottled lemon juice. Not sure if that was what "did it" or not, but this had a pretty tart/acidic taste that was a little overwhelming. Next time, I will try to manage that issue. I served this Best Spanish Rice from this site.

Delishes! I made few changes to it, added some water to make the chicken more moist, added mushrooms, some zucchini and butter squash, and a sprinkle of taco seasoning. Left out cumin and chilli. My salsa was lime salsa so for that reason I left out lemon. Added some “vegeta” seasoning (available at our local international market) and a tablespoon of avocado oil. Turned out great. Will definitely make again!!

This was so delicious and full of flavor!  Will definitely make this again.   I would change it up just a bit...Cook at 350 for 1 hr, so chicken doesn’t dry out, mix all ingredients together even the beans , and drain some juice from the salsa , I would use half the spices but that is just my preference, Top with cheese and a dollop of sour cream and green onion or cilantro.

Very good, the spices came through but did not overwhelm the rest of the dish. I think next time I make it, I might use the seasoned black beans. Served it with Greek yogurt for a topping which we love for our Mexican style dished. Great!

I added some frozen corn to the salsa mix.
I think I would drain off some of the liquid from the salsa when I do it again.
It was 'soupier' than I wanted it to be but the sauce tasted great on rice.

The leftover chicken is now shredded for lunch.

This was loved by all!  Because of the large size of my chicken breast, I cut each in half prior to loading everything on top!  I added 1 can of mild chili’s, 1 can of olives, after topping with cheese and allowing 5 minutes to melt, I added a dollop of sour cream per serving. Also only baked at 350 for 1 hour........delicious.

I resisted wanting to add chopped onion, with the pepper.
I followed the recipe as written. I baked it in my Lodge enamel cast iron cookware with the lid.
the chicken was tender, and the flavor profile very good. I
When I make this again, I do believe I will chop some onion with the pepper. And add a finishing touch of grated cheese when baking is finished!, 
Delicious, quick, simple

This was only OK. Won’t be likely to make it again. The beans dried out on top, and the salsa mixture was dull - too heavy on cumin and chili powder. The whole dish looked unappealingly dark. The chicken was moist, though. Added cheese and chopped cilantro to the top at the end, which helped.

I used chicken thighs as I think they are more flavorful than breasts
I rendered them first skin side down
I also put cheese on top and cooked it uncovered for the last 10 minutes 
It was fabulous

Made this last night and my husband loved it.  The only thing I changed was left out the red bell pepper cause I didn't have one.  I substituted hot green chili's and baked only 45 minutes & topped with shredded cheddar cheese.   Yum!

Good meal. Used black beans cooked from dry which I can make with less salt. Also increased the amount of beans by about 2 cups. Great rolled in a flour tortilla with yellow rice. Since I added more beans I added more spice.

I thought this was going to be a great way to give chicken a kick.  My whole family was disappointed in me after serving this which is unusual because Allrecipes has made me a look like a master chef with other recipes.

Loved this dish.  Had more sauce than expected but was perfect for creating rice bowls.  The flavor was amazing!  We added shredded cheese when serving.  Served with a fresh dinner salad.  Yumm!

I added a can of sweetcorn, some cheese, sour cream, brown rice and I actually shredded the chicken.  It was OK, but not the best recipe for Mexican chicken.

I split the range of the cooking time and went with 1:15.  That was certainly too long. Many comments say 45 minutes but you shouldn't have to dig into the comments for something so basic it.  It comes out soupy and some how sort of bland despite all the salsa.

Made as laid out in recipe, added one chopped onion, served it with Maria's Mexican rice recipe, great combination that will get made again. Next time I'm going to use half breast, half chicken thighs.

Husband loved it (me too!)  I didnt have a red pepper on hand but it was fine without it. I also added 1/2 of an onion, thinly sliced, and two carrots cut into small pieces. I cut the chicken into 2” - 3” wide strips. I used a bottle of salsa from Walmart as the sauce to add the spices to and it was delicious. We served it over rice and with the shredded cheese on top it was great. I’ll definitely make it again!
I forgot to add: I made it in the CROCKPOT, cooked on low for 6.5 hours and it came out perfect!

I made the recipe with the measurements for ingredients as listed except for the black beans.  I only used one can instead of 2 as I wasn't sure if we would like them.  It turned out fabulous, just the right amount of heat and great flavor, the chicken pulled apart with a fork.  I served it with rice.  I will definitely make this recipe again but maybe try it with tortillas.

This recipe was a hit with us!  First off, I loved how quick & easy it was to put together.  I followed the advice of other reviewers, and combined the black beans with the salsa & other ingredients.  I also sprinkled taco seasoning over the chicken breasts in the morning, and added about 1 TBL  taco seasoning to the salsa mixture.  Mexican chicken without taco seasoning just didn't seem right!  Again, as other reviewers commented, I baked it at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes, covered, then added about 1/4 cup of each shredded cheddar & shredded mozzarella, and baked another 15 minutes, uncovered.  We served this topped with sliced black olives & chopped red onion.  We also had flour tortillas, refried beans, and shredded lettuce on the side.  I would definitely make this again.   Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe and everyone including the picky eaters loved it!  I did cut the recipe in half because I used chicken thighs instead of breast and it was less chicken.  This is the only change I made and it was delicious!  Thank you for sharing!

This was a very easy recipe to make and it was delicious. The chicken was moist and tender and went well with the other ingredients. 
I didn’t cook it for as long as the recipe said and had the oven at 375° instead of 400° which worked out well. 
I sprinkled cheese over it before I served it just to give it a topping over the beans. 
Anyway it was delicious and I would definitely make it again.

This was very good and a nice way to cook chicken breast that did not dry it out.  I live alone so I was cooking less than the recipe called for but although I sized down the ingredients, I did not change them at all.  I don't like too hot so used mild salsa.  I thought this was delicious and will definitely make it again.

Super easy and delicious. I used green pepper (didn’t have red) and baked at 350 for 45 minutes. Sprinkled shredded cheddar on top for last 10 minutes. Everyone loved it!

It was very good as I follwed directions exactly the first time I made it. But hubby thought something was missing. So the second time I added a little more salsa and a can of Mexican corn.  Excellent!

This was delicious!! I only subbed out the lemon juice; did fresh lime juice instead. Also, mixed all the topping ingredients together, including the beans. Baked at 350 for an hour. Chicken was SO tender. (Truth be told: I'm not a huge fan of chicken breast because it can easily be overcooked and dry.) I served the dish atop plain rice. My family went back for seconds, always a good sign!

This chicken was such a welcome change to our usual chicken dishes. I did change a few things up...I added extra garlic, three cheese Mexican blend packet of cheese on top, scallions, black olives (at the end) and fresh cilantro throughout and then on top at the end. Like others, I baked for 45 minutes on 375 and then broiled at the end until the cheese was melted. Super delicious and I will make again!

Yes, I mashed the beans with a little thyme and fresh lime juice - gives the beans a "boost" so that you don't get that definitive blah inside bean flavor when you bite into a bean.

I cut the cumin and chili powder in half- 1 tbsp of each.  It was still VERY flavorful. My husband and I both enjoyed it and have leftovers to have again.

This is a great and easy recipe. I made it last night and adjusted the recipe for 2 people. It was flavorful and easy. My husband has been raving about this. I made a side dish of roasted vegetables  with  brown rice. I also lessened the cooking time to between 45-60 minuites.

I must admit, I did not make this based on the recipe, however, I have made this  myself, using no recipe, just made it up. The only difference is that I season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, garlic powder and cumin before lightly  sauteing them in a small amount of oil, about 3 minutes per side, in an oven-proof enamel-covered cast iron saute pan. I use a salsa that is chunky and already has black beans, corn, onions, and chunky tomatoes, which adds to the flavor and texture. I spoon over the browned chicken, bake for 15minutes @350, sprinkle with the cheese of your preference, and bake  or broil until cheese is bubbling. If you don't have salsa, you can substitute Barbecue sauce, or sauce of your preference. The chicken comes out tender and juicy every time. I gave this five stars because this is so similar to mine,so I know how it tastes.

For dietary reasons I left out the black beans.  It smelled better cooking than it tasted.  Pretty bland.  Probably won't make it again.

A keeper.  Hubby loved it;  also my friend to whom I sent some leftovers.
For those who said the black beans dried out, why not put them on the chicken, then add the sauce, as I did?
Also, re: other reviewers, I baked at 350, for about 70 minutes.

I used boneless, skinless thighs (6 of them) and mixed the beans and all ingredients together before pouring over the chicken.  Following the directions I baked it far too long (the cheese was rather over-done) but it came out so flavorful.  Very much enjoyed it and it got 5 stars from everyone else as well.

I have been making a dish simular to this for quite so time. I sprinkle salt, pepper  and cumin on the chicken to taste. Place the chicken (6 boneless, skinless) in a 13x9 baking dish and cover with  parchment paper. Bake at 400 degrees for 25 minutes, remove from oven and cover the chicken  with salsa and cheese, place back in oven with the parchment paper back on top and bake 10 minutes more. Serve topped with sour cream and chopped green onion. Chicken is always tender, juicy and cooked.

This turned out very nice. Easy to make, open for all kinds of additions. The whole house smelled so good when it was done cooking and lingering on the stove top. I used chicken thighs instead of breasts. The meat isn’t so dry. I did take the advice of others and cooked it at 375 for 45 minutes. Sliced up some avocado, chopped up some tomatoes and black olives to spread on top when ready to serve. Definitely a flavorful go to meal in a pinch.

wow!!! this was a really yummy dinner! we couldn't stop eating it. I took the advice of others and mixed the beans into the mixture. I also only baked for about 35 minutes covered at 350. Topped with a three cheese blend and green onions for 5 more minutes uncovered. Served with fresh chopped tomato and sour cream on top. Rice and corn on the side.

Loved this recipe. Used less then half the chili powder because Hubby-Les is not a spicy hot lover. Wait-Great lover ...not Hot Spice Lover!!! LOL! Served with brown rice. Loved it. Also used thighs, not breasts. Yummy on a snowy day in Michigan!!! Sides of asparagus spears and deviled eggs.

I love this recipe, however....I cut the chicken into chunks because it's easier to eat over salad or rice like that. I love that it's so easy and all in one pan. I usually make a fresh pico de gallo with it and add cheese, cilantro, avocado, or anything else to the individual serving. It helps control the calories. Also good when you mix the black beans and whole corn together!

This was absolutely delicious.  I made as is with my homemade salsa.  I  served it with all the taco fixings and Spanish rice.  My 16 year old grandson could not say enough good things about it!  He is also very health conscious and noted all the good nutrients and healthy foods in this recipe.  I will definitely make it again.  Thanks so much for sharing this.

I'm new to the diabetic world and was looking for something good to eat. This is a perfect recipe, everyone loved it. I halved the recipe and decreased the cumin just a bit for personal preference and you!

mixed beans in with the rest, sprinkled on some cheese, added green onions and olives at the end and a little sour cream.  Really yummy, do use bottled salsa vs fresh

Delicious.  I made my own salsa as I can't always buy good quality jars, tins and ready made here, but I always get fresh, organic ingredients at my local market. I would honestly say to anyone thinking about making this dish, just do it.

My husband said and I quote, better than expected. It was good. Reminded me of going to a moe's Tijuana flats and or chipotle depending on what you prefer. Served over rice made with chicken broth. Topped with cheese. I'll make again.

The chicken was lacking flavor. I did add the tortilla chips and cheese and reduced the baking time. Edible but not memorable.

Mine turned out surprisingly watery, so I definitely suggest serving it with rice. I used one can of black beans and one can of chili beans that were drained but not rinsed.  I used lime juice because I had limes and served with sliced black olives.

I loved it and my boyfriend loved it. Very quick and easy. Added both lemon and lime juice. I didn't have cumin. I would recommend using less chilli powder, but definitely a yummy recipe!

I swapped one of the cans of beans for a can of sweet corn to break it up a little bit.  I think 1hr is plenty to bake and it can probably be more like 40ish min, but I haven't tried that yet.  I also like to season the chicken before topping it w/ a mixture of garlic powder and chilli powder.

Very good for something so simple. With the tomato-based salsa and chili powder along with the beans, ended up tasting like chili on chicken.

I made this recipe for my family and they all LOVED it. My picky 4 yr old daughter even gave it the thumbs up. I only changed the chicken breasts to drumsticks because that is what we had at the time. It would be good with any cut of chicken. This is a delicious dish!! Thanks for posting it.

So good- so easy!!!!  So healthy!  I used 'roman beans' (it's what I had in the pantry) and chipolte flavored salsa- baked at 375 for about 30 mins.  Served over spanish rice- sprinkled some(lf) cheese on the top- dolloped with (lf)sour cream - and viola!  Healthy dinner with MINIMAL effort!  Great recipe for a busy day!

This recipe was nothing special. I added corn and cheese on top at the end. I felt like it was missing something. The plus side was the chicken came out really moist. I cooked it at 375 instead of 400. I think the leftover corn and beans mixed with the salsa will be a nice dip though!

This was pretty delicious! I used one can of black beans and used green bell pepper instead of red. Used one big chicken breast half and baked this in an 8x8 glass pan, only for about 45 minutes. Delicious over Spanish rice!

This was so easy to make and was definitely mine and my boyfriend's favorite so far.  It was juicy and full of flavor. I did take the suggestion of another reviewer and added a sprinkle of  Mexican cheese and crushed blue corn tortilla chips, which was an excellent addition.  I served it with the "mexican rice I" recipe from this site that I made in my rice cooker.  Easy & delicious.

Very good! I followed others reviews and added the beans in with the salsa mixture along with some frozen corn.  I reduced the heat to 375 and it was done perfectly in 50 minutes!  The last 10 minutes I added sharp cheddar cheese on top and took off the cover.  Will make again!

This was delicious! My husband and I loved it.  The changes I made was to add some  onion and taco seasoning along with the other spices and as other users suggested I added the black beans with the salsa mix.  I also used a green bell pepper because I did not have a red one. I cooked for about an hour at 375, but the chicken breasts I used were larger than the ones I usually buy.

This was an easy to make recipe and tasted fine, just not a favorite of mine without some modifying.  I think the chicken needs to be marinated in some spices before it is baked.  I think next time I would also add cheese on top for the last five minutes of baking.  I halved the recipe and it took about 45 minutes.  I served this with some brown rice.  I think I would make this again with some changes.

I am on a low fat low calorie diet and this absolutely was wonderful!  It's hard to believe how healthy this really is!  I topped with a little bit of mexi mix cheese and some jalepeno peppers!  Can't wait to make it again!

What a way to spice up baked chicken! I added sour cream as a topping and it gave the dish the right combination of spicy and  cool.

I really loved this dish, it was sooooo good. I doubled the recipe when came to beans and salsa but I only used enough seasoning for one recipe. I also followed the other suggestions by cutting back on the cumin and adding onions. I also added a packet of taco mix to spice it up. My family love it, I will do it again.

I didn't like this recipe much. Made it exactly as stated but just tasted like chicken nachos or something because of the salsa. This would be good if you really liked the taste of jar salsa. Chicken was really tender though. I won't be making this again however.

YUMMMY!! This was great! Cut recipe in half for my honey and I.  We loved it, the chicken was very tender and the dish had so much flavor to it!  Served over white rice. This is a keeper! Thanks so much!
