They look fantastic... Wondering if I could use the organic store bought biscuits instead of making the dough? I just don't have time for all that... Wondering if they could possibly be baked instead too... Anyone?

Made it just like the recipe. Took me back to my high school days living in San Francisco. IT WAS AWESOME!

Made with Turkey and fresh dill.  One lb of meat seemed to be enough for the amount of dough to make 15 pirozhki.  Definitely listen to Chef John's instructions to get rid of the extra dough as it will not cook in 90 minutes.  Nice to have on hand for lunches.

I have a old family recipe that has a good twist. Cultural cooking is regional, always provides a relationship of familial tastes and national heritage. Simply put, all is good, tasty, and provides an atmosphere of oneness.

Didn't use dill because I didn't have any.  Used Penzeys Spices  Mural Of Flavor.   Came out fantastic. 

Thanks Chef John !
