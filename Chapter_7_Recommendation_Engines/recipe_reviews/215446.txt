This was good and easy to make. I changed it up a bit because of what I had on hand. I didn't have carrots so I used peas. I didn't have potatoes so I used cream of potato soup. I also had 1/2 cup of broth so used it all. I also used biscuits instead of making my own. I had a pound of chipped deli turkey so used that (didn't measure how much- used the whole pound). I added about 1/2 tsp of pepper and 1/4 tsp of salt. We all enjoyed this but next time I would maybe add another can of soup or more broth as I would have liked more "gravy".

The best part of this recipe is hpw easy and delicious the Bisquick topper is! I poured the liquid pancake mix over all of the ingredients in the pie dish and popped it in the oven.

This recipe was great. I added 2 cans cream of chicken & 1/2 c. broth to add more sauce & I also made my own crust. Everyone thought it was great. Going to try it using beef with cream of mushroom.

I have to rate the recipe as written at 3* for lack of variety of veggies and for the canned cream soup.  I doctored it up a bit and it came out FANTASTIC!  Instead of canned veggies, I sauteed chopped onion, celery, carrot and garlic then added some frozen corn and peas and boiled potato cubes.  Next I added leftover homemade pan gravy that had some mushroom in it (that had gotten quite thick in the fridge) and also added cream to replicate the canned soup.  Good way to use some of that leftover gravy.  Boy was it goooooooood!  Try these revisions...a little extra work but still easy-and worth it!

We loved it! Read other reviews and did double up on the soup and stock. This one went quickly - didn't even stay around long enough to get a photo.

So I used this as a baseline for making my own leftover thanksgiving pot pies.  I used mashed potatoes, and packaged frozen veggies.  I also put the filling in individual foil trays, topped with flakey honey biscuits!

Very good and easy to make. I put cream of mushroom instead, and broccoli in place of the corn. This turned out well.

This is the second year I have made this recipe. My three kids who can be incredibly picky tore though this last year, which is sometimes unheard of. This year I used a family sized cream of chicken instead of just a single can. I also purchased four pie crusts and took two that I used for the top crust instead of using bisquick. I also mixed some stuffing in with it.

Great for Thanksgiving leftovers.  I boiled up my own carrots and a potato, otherwise followed the menu.  It was delicious, warm, and easy to make.  I used a basic biscuit recipe rather than buying Bisquick.  Still really fast.  We didn't find it bland.

This was very good - a big hit with my family. I took the advice of others and doubled the soup and liquid. I also just used whatever veggies I had on hand. Great!!!

Good, basic recipe, but rather bland. Made my own adjustments. Added about 1 tsp of Mrs. Dash to the mixture.  Used canned lowfat chicken gravy instead of the C O Chicken Soup.    Didn't want to roll out the Bisquick dough, so I used a 5.5oz pkg of Bisquick mixed with 1/3 c + 1 TBSP of milk, and dropped it by Tablespoons onto the mixture before baking.  Not sure if I'd add potatoes next time - I feel that there's enough starch with the Bisquick.

Great way to get the most from holiday leftovers! I didn't have milk so I used 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/3 cup water and it work great. My husband is diabetic; so I left out the potatoes to cut down on carbs. Also, I used bisquick cheesey garlic bisket mix and it rocked!! Thanks so much for saving my leftover bird.

I think this recipe is good and it's like most recipes, you can customize by taste. I think one person missed the easy part of the title and unfairly lowered the rating. I say follow the recipe, I would either add more soup, which cream of celery with cream of chicken combo works here or a little broth did not hurt either.

I loved this, and so did everyone at the church picnic! I'll admit, I used substitutions, simply out of using what I had. In place of the 3 cans of veggies, I use 2 cans mixed veggies and a handful of frozen corn. Increased the chicken broth (again I substituted with chicken bullion cube and water) and used two cans soup. This was amazing and these substitutions keep me making it as I always have the stuff on hand.
