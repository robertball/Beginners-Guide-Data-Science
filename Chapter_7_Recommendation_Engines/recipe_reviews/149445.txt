I hate making cookies, but I loved this recipe. It was easy and the cookies tasted great and stayed soft.

I think the temp needs to be set at 350 for a dark nonstick pan. Mine came out a little dark on the bottoms. Flavor is great. I found it odd the batter wasnt as thick as a normal cookie batter. I may add more flour next time. Probably 1/2 cup more to a cup. Overall... This recipe needs minor improvements but it is a good cookie. Love the brown sugar splenda. Try making baked beans with it!!

Very good cookies.  I did add some walnuts.  Next time I will not use so much batter per cookie.

These cookies are great, if you do use a darker pan I would recommend the temp. on 350f , mine where VERY brown and crisp. I love that kind though. My cookie dough was a little soupy, I thought these cookies would end up a mess but when I got them in the oven they turned out fine. Overall, great recipe

I loved this recipe, I would create it anytime if I wanted to and had the ingredients. These were the best cookies I have ever had especially that they were soft and not burnt. I recommend this recipe to anyone who wants to eat a tasty cookies and the best part is that it only takes 20 minutes to make and not 1 hour.

I was looking for a recipe for sugar free chocolate covered pretzels when I came accross these cookies. Why would someone use the splenda when in the end you throw in semi sweet chocolate? I never did find a recipe for the pretzels, so if anyone has one I would love to use it.
