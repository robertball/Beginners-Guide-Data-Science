Wow! GREAT recipe! I've made this several times and its always a hit. My only hint/tip is to make sure all filling ingredients are at room temp. prior to blending (warm the unopened can of cond. milk in a bowl of very warm water!) so that a smooth, even finished product results! YUM!

This is great!!  Everyone thinks I am a fabulous cook whenever I bring this cheesecake.  Follow the recipe exactly, but after the 55 min baking time, turn the oven off, and leave the cheesecake in the now cooling oven for at least 1 hour.  It will not crack, and it will be firmed up in the middle.  It's best if eaten the next day, but no one will complain if it's only been chilled a few hours.

Absolutley Awesome!!!  I am not a big chocolate cheesecake fan usually (I like plain old New York Cheesecake)but I thought I'd try this for my honey's birthday!!WOW, decadently sinful!!  Very smooth, creamy and rich, just like truffles.  I would recommend using the crust recipe given for this as it is much better than just a chocolate cookie crumb crust.  I also used a 10" springform pan.  Came out flawless, not a crack to be found.  I put a pan of water on the rack below the cheesecake and left in the oven for about an hour after I turned the oven off!!  I also baked it two days in advance and kept in the fridge.  Serve at room temp. though!! Definitly a keeper!!

This cheesecake has become a part of my signature dessert.  I accidentally came accross another recipe at "ALLRECIPES.com" called "Raspberry White Chocolate Mousse" Submitted by: Stacey Walery.  I combined the two by makeing them each according to the submitted directions.  After the cheesecake has cooled, I had the mousse to the top and chill in the pan.  With the rasberry sauce you can make a beautiful plate presentation to really wow your friends and guests.  And, the mousse really helps to offset the richness of the cheescake.  You simply must give this a try.  Remember, a little piece of this dessert goes a long way.  Enjoy.

This cheesecake is AMAZING!!!  I served it at my Christmas party and it VANISHED.  Everyone was raving about it.  First, I used all Neufchatel cheese (1/3 less fat).  I baked it for 58 minutes on a cookie sheet in a springform pan.  Instead of the crust suggested in the recipe, I baked a box of brownies for 30 minutes, then while hot I scooped the brownie out and pressed it into the bottom of the springform pan.  Then I poured the cheesecake in and baked it as usual.  After the cheesecake cooled, I mixed up a ganache (boil 1 cup half and half, remove from heat, add 8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate and 1 ounce bittersweet chocolate, wisk until smooth).  I poured the ganache on top of the cheesecake and immediatly placed it back into the fridge for 30 minutes to cool.  This was AMAZING.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!

This cheesecake was amazing.  I made them into individual cakes using foil wrappers, and an oreo cookie half for the crust, then baked for 12-15 minutes.  Turned out really well, and easy to divide for gifts.

One word comes to mind after taking a bite of this…decadent!  This truly tasted like a fudge truffle, it was rich, creamy, almost silky!  I used reduced fat cream cheese, but trust me, you would have never known the difference.  I would also recommend that you use a very good chocolate, I used Wilbur semi-sweet chocolate.  Also, make sure your cream cheese and eggs are at room temperature to achieve that smooth silky consistency and I always add the eggs one at a time as I beat them in.  The cookie crust is absolutely perfect, I wouldn’t cheat and use Oreos for the crust, they just don’t seem to go with the taste of a truffle.

Wow! This was a wonderful recipe. I have made other cheese cakes and this recipe is very easy. My cake did crack but I filled in the top with a dark chocolate ganache and it looked perfect. I had people ask me where I bought the cheese cake! One big tip, when cutting your cake run your knife under hot water, dry it off, and slice. Do this for each cut and you will have a perfectly cut cake. Time consuming but so worth it.

I have made this 3 times already~ everyone loves it. I used graham cracker crumbs instead of vanilla wafers~ yum yum yum. It does come out a little underdone, so I just leave it in the oven while it cools.

The recipe was good and the cake turned out great - but it wasn't "all that I had hoped for" based on the reviews.  I felt it was a "good" chocolate cheesecake but not phenomenal like others promised.  It didn't remind me of truffles and it wasn't "fudgy" per say. I would try an oreo crust if I made it again.  I did melt semi-sweet chips in a ziplock bag, cut the corner  and wrote "Happy Birthday Mom" in chocolate and drizzled it all along the edges and down the sides which made for a very pretty looking dessert.  Not sure I will make it again though.  I'm still searching for something that is a chocolate explosion that can fulfill my fantasies!

This cheesecake is wonderful. I made a regular Nilla crust and used milk choc chips and it is great. I dressed it up with drizzled white and dark choc and choc covered strawberries! It is a firmer cheesecake. I think that people that had dry, cracked cheesecake over baked it. Cheesecake is supposed to jiggle in the middle in my opinion. It is still very creamy too. If you like a really soft, pudding like cake it is not for you.

This was delicious.  I used a brownie crust and high quality milk chocolate.  I am a chocolate lover so I added even more to it.  I used a raspberry cake filling to swirl throughout.  (boil 1 1.2 cups frozen rapsberries with 2 tablesppons of lemon juice.  Put the mixture through a seive to remove the seeds.  Return the mixture to the heat and add 1/4 cup of sugar and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch.  Mix until blended.  Once it is cooled add to cake mixture.  I also added a shot of raspberry amaretto to give just a bit more flavor.)  
As per others suggestions, I baked for the alloted time with a water bath.  Then I left it in the turned off oven with the door open for an hour to cool. After the cake was fully cooled I used the Chocolate Ganache recipe (with semi sweet chocolate) from this site to coat the entire cake.  I placed the cooled cake on a wired baking rack placed over a cake pan.  Then I poured the ganache over it.  Once I emptied the bowl, I poured the dripping bake into it to give it another coating.  This helped make sure ever possible bit of cake was covered and ever drop of ganche was used.  I finished it off with raspberry garnishes and chocolate curls.  No one believed I made it.  They insisted it came from the local high end dessert cafe.  I had to show them the dirty dishes to prove it.

Rich, creamy, and delicious. I used 2 1/2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips because I wanted it extra dark and chocolatey. Instead of using vanilla wafers, I prepared a small box of fudge brownie mix and baked it in the pan for the crust.
I set a pan of water on the bottom rack in the oven
and the cheesecake baked perfectly with no cracks. It's incredibly rich so a little slice will do ya! This is without question one of the best cheesecakes I've tried.

I made this cheesecake twice in less than a week.  The first time I used generic chocolate chips and it turned out wonderfull.  The second time I used higher quality chocolate and it was absolutely decadent!!!  This is the easiest cheesecake I have ever made (and I have made quite a few.)  The first one I cut into 12 pieces and people were not able to eat the entire piece.  It was such a waste to throw out all the half eaten pieces.  The second one I cut into 16 pieces and most everyone could eat this size.  I served it with a raspberry sauce also found on this website.  Thank you very much for this recipe.  Everyone could not believe that it was homemade.

Sinful and decadent!  I baked for exactly 55 minutes and then left in the oven after I turned in off for an hour.  Turned out beautiful - no cracks.  I did make the brownie crust as another reviewer suggested.  We'll see how this does at the dessert auction I made it for!

The perfect recipe for simple but delicious cheesecake!  This was actually my first time making chocolate cheesecake, so I was kind of nervous about how it would come out, but it was so good that it barely lasted one day!  I used ready-made chocolate graham cracker crust, added about 3 tbs. raspberry jam to the melted chocolate, and 3 tbs. cocoa to the batter in the end.  SO GOOD!!!!!

A perfect gastronomic paradox.  You cut into it and it appears to be a really dry heavy cheesecake, yet when it hits your mouth it's the most inexplicable creamy delight!  
This makes a fantastic presentation, looks like you paid big money from a speciality market.  I  used a crushed chocolate cookie crust and dusted it with Ghirardelli sweet gound chocolate and cocoa so it really had a dusted truffle look. I'll be sure I make some raspberry coulis for it next time as I love the combo of chocolate and raspberry.

I really don't need to comment on this cheesecake...it's chocolate cheesecake, it's wonderful!!!!  I want to comment on a discovery I made while making it...I dipped strawberries in some leftover batter and OH MY GOD....so good.  I have no idea if the batter would hold up if you tried to serve it this way, but if you make this cheesecake I highly recommend you try the strawberry dip.

One word - keeper! At first I thought it would be too sweet with the condensed milk but it was just the right balance. Not too chocolatey but enough. I managed to make 16 servings...easier to divide equally, everyone was very satisfied with their piece. If you plan to make it in advance like I did ie the nite before, please ensure the cheesecake is totally cooled before you put it on the fridge. Otherwise it will "sweat" as the heat of it meets the cold of a fridge. Water droplets gathered on the plastic wrap I placed over the springform pan and dripped onto my beauty. I had to dribble some melted white chocolate on top to make it presentable.

This cheesecake is outstanding.  I've seriously impressed not only my family but myself.  This will be my "can take it anywhere dessert."  I found that my cake was still largely uncooked in the center after 55 minutes.  I may cook it longer next time - maybe another 10 minutes.  It will be fun to experiment with different toppings.  I served it the same day and it was still warm.  The next day it was out of this world!  Make the day before if you can.  Most surprisingly was how EASY this was to prepare.  Something that tastes so good should take a lot more sweat and tears.  I can't thank you enough.

Didn't like - looking for a chocolate explosion but this wasn't it.  Do not follow other reviews suggestions to turn off the oven and leave for another 1 hour, my cheesecake was perfect at 55 minutes and the add'l time in the over produced nothing more than a huge crack that ruined the cheesecake - the crack means that it was over baked.  Geez!

This was good - but I don't know if I'll make it again. It's very rich, and it was difficult to tell when it was done. Overall I wasn't super impressed by the taste and consistency, it was good but not great.

If this doesn't hit "the chocolate spot," nothing will !!  The only change I made to the recipe was to use Kahlua instead of vanilla extract (only because I didn't have any on hand).  But I must say, the substitution was a brilliant idea!!  It made this decadent dessert that much more sinfully good!!  Great recipe !!!!

A very rich cheesecake, chosen for its ease of preparation. The flavor, however, was not intensely chocolate-y, but had some caramel undertones, thanks to the condensed milk. It definitely lends itself to an additional flavor, such as raspberry, orange or maple. Being the experimenting type, I mixed in a drop of maple extract to a bite of cooked cheesecake. ABSOLUTELY excellent and noteworthy. Because of this I will be trying again with a small amount of extract (1/2 to 1 teaspoon? I'll have to taste the batter). Ten stars with a flavor boost =)

Oh my, this is amazing stuff!! I followed this recipe to a T, but put a water bath on the shelf below the cake and turned the oven off after 55 minutes and left in there for on hour. I also added a ganache over the top after it had cooled in frig and put it back in the frig. This is extremely rich but oh so good! Thank you!!

WOW!!!  Amazing, light fluffy.  I did a trial run for my Christmas presents by making cupcake sized cakes.  I also used 1/2 of an Oreo as the base.  It was perfect.  I have made this several times now....I make sure that the ingredients are room temperature, I also bake for approx 55 min and then remove from the oven, run a sharp knife around the outside so it can shrink as it cools and then return it to the oven and turn the oven off so it can cool slowly.  This is excellent and I even freeze it now, thaw slightly and then serve!!!  Yummy!!!!

Frozen Chocolate Cheesecake Pops: make cheesecake as directed. Cool completely. Cut into 12 slices with a clean hot knife. Freeze slices on a cookie sheet for 1 hour. Carefully insert a wide Popsicle/craft stick. Freeze at least 2 hrs or overnight. Make chocolate ganache (recipe on allrecipes). Cool ganache until thick but still liquid. Dip frozen cheesecake slices to cover completely. Freeze one last time on parchment covered baking sheet. Enjoy! Great gift too!

Super recipe!  I did use crushed Oreos for the crust, but the filling was made just as directed.  Yum!  First time made it plain and second time I made with a mint chocolate ganache on top.  Sinful, indeed! Thanks for the recipe!

OHMYGOSH....this is sooo good!  I made it using Hershey's semi-sweet chocolate chips and I used graham cracker crumbs instead of the vanilla cookies, and it was PERFECT!  I put boiling water in a pan below the cheesecake while it cooked just to make sure it wouldn't crack, but I think it wouldn't have any way.  I could only find my 10 inch springform pan and it still came out perfect!  I dare you not to love it!!

Definitely for "chocoholics"...very rich!  It makes a beautiful presentation (no cracks, even).  I topped it with chocolate covered strawberries.  I used my own crust recipe (1 1/2 cups chocolate graham crackers crumbs, 1/2 cup sugar & 1/4 cup melted butter).

...and the compliments just keep on coming.  I used reduced fat cream cheese and condensed milk, doubled the crust but still used about 1/3 c butter, and substituted egg beaters for two of the eggs.  No cracks whatsoever after cooling for an hour in the oven and then for another half hour on the countertop.  Served with the Supreme Strawberry Topping on this site and some chocolate sauce drizzled over the top, this dessert is absolutely to die for!

THIS IS THE BEST!!!!  The texture is is sublime, and it baked with NO cracks!  amazing!  I made this for my husband's parents and his Dad was licking the pan!  It is not overly chocolatey, so lovers of dark and milk chocolate will adore this, and of course it is a VERY easy recipe to follow.   I melted my chocolate chip in the microwave instead of a double boiler and it still turned out fantastic!  THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE, ANNE!!!!!

Sinfully Decadent..amazingly easy to put together and baking cheesecake need not be a daunting task.  Always, Always, ALWAYS use a water bath and leave it in the oven for at least an hour after baking is done (do NOT open the door!).  Perfect results every time! :) Gorgeously, smooth, chocolate truffle flavour, love the crust too, not too sweet, and not thick either, perfecto!

Amazing cheesecake! It was my first one ever and it turned out great! It had no cracks and it was very rich and delicious. As others had recommended I increased the amount of crumbs by 1/2 and since I couldn't find any vanilla wafer, I use Oreo crumbs. My only complaint is that the cheesecake didn't turn out as dark as on the pictures so for next time I would probably add more cocoa

I made this cheesecake for a work holiday party and it seemed to go over well. A fairly easy and straightforward recipe, I followed this one to the letter (and I am usually a recipe tweaker). I would melt the butter used in the crust next time. Also, I found the semisweet chips a tad too bitter, even with the sweetened condensed milk, so I would opt for milk chocolate chips next time. I let my colleagues help themselves to an optional dollop of homemade chocolate whipped cream. Chocolate overload!

I made this for a Thanksgiving dessert this year and got nothing but compliments on it.  Three of my relatives asked me for the recipe.  There was too much filling the first time I made it, so I doubled the crust and made two complete cheesecakes the next time.  Then the recipe worked out perfectly.

This is excellant just as written. You could use any favorite crust. I may try it with an "Oreo" crust next time. Just be sure not to overbake this. My friend and I both used the same recipe. Both cakes were good, but hers was a little heavier and drier. My was very  "creamy". I assume hers had been baked a little longer.

The ingredients for this recipe were all out of proportion! I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't make enough crust for my shallow 9 inch pan and it made MORE than TWO TIMES enough filling! And following it to the recipe, it was not nearly close to chocolatey enough! The picture is much much darker than what it actually makes. It makes a super light brown hardly chocolatey filling. You need at least 1 more cup chocolate chips and it STILL hardly tastes chocolatey! I made a second cheesecake because there was so much left over filling and I added a whole 2 extra cups chocolate chips. also, melting the chocolate in a double boiler is a waste of time. The exact same result can be derived from microwaving each cup chocolate 30 seconds at a time and stirring in between. The double boiler isn't necessary. this was a bad recipe, and the directions weren't nearly extensive enough. The ingredient measurements were all out of whack, and like I said earlier, i followed this recipe exactly on the first cheesecake. I didn't substitute anything and i measured just how it reads. If you want to make this recipe, make half the filling, 125% of the crust it calls for and don't use vanilla wafers as I did on the first cake - use finely crushed Oreos and no cocoa powder. And I can assure you that the picture of the cheesecake is an entirely different color than what the recipe actually makes! Very disappointed,  Megan, Rochester, NY

Very nice chocolately treat! I prepared the recipe exactly as written. I made sure everything was room temperature before starting and once the cheesecake was done baking, I turned the oven off and let it rest (in the oven) for an hour. I can't wait to make it again.

I have to admit that cheesecake has to be my most favourite dessert of all time to eat and since I am a chocoholic too, this was perfect for me!  I made this for my sister and brother in laws birthdays this weekend and it was superb!  Rich, creamy, decadent...what more can I say!  The only thing I did different was to use 3 eggs and one egg white since I had a carton to use up.  Baked as called for, turned off the oven and let sit for another hour - not one crack, beautiful!  Let the cheesecake cool and then melted a one ounce square of white chocolate to drizzle over the top - SCRUMPTIOUS!  I did make this a day before I was serving it since cheesecake is always better the next day.  5 stars plus for sure!

This was a good, basic chocolate cheesecake.  I prefer a creamier texture, rather than the traditional firm texture like this is.  I was looking for something more, something *wow* to serve at a party, but this won't be it.

My boyfriend didn't sound very enthusiastic about a chocolate cheesecake but absolutely loved this one. Unfortunately he ate 2 big pieces and could hardly walk afterwards. The  recipe is quite easy, only a few ingredients and the cheesecake doesn't crack because of the condensed milk. I baked mine in a water bath and it turned out a bit custardy but on the whole it’s a massive impressive success. I dusted mine with cocoa powder, decorated with chocolate swirls and served with raspberry sauce and whipped cream.

WOW.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Creamy, rich, sweet.  So easy to make and it came out looking so beautiful. It is really rich so either expect left lots of leftovers or make a smaller version.  I covered the leftovers with plastic wrap and froze it.  It froze well- no signs of it ever have been frozen.

This recipe was fabulous!  I made it for 12 people (guys and girls included) and everyone thought it was from the Cheesecake Cafe restaurant.   The only thing I changed was the crust.  I used the oreo cookie crust instead of making it from scratch.

This is less susceptible to cracks, than a traditional cheesecake.  Don’t be intimidated by this recipe.  It's an elegant dessert -- plus you can make it ahead of time and freeze it.  Simply, pull it out of the freezer a day before you want to serve and it put it into the refrigerator.

Awesome.  Went over extremely well at the gathering to which I brought it.  The host's mother said it was the best chocolate cheesecake she'd ever had.  

I substituted 1 teaspoon almond extract for one of the teaspoons of vanilla.  Substituted graham cracker crumbs for vanilla wafers.

Cut pieces small - even in 16ths very few of the guests actually finished the piece.

Take the name of the recipe very, very seriously. I had in mind a chocolate cheesecake, but this thing was just a monster! Incredibly dense; my husband accused me of trying to kill him with it. While I appreciate it for what it was, it was just too potent for me, and I think I'll keep looking for a more standard recipe. Thanks anyway, it was fun!

Fairly easy to make....came out creamy/rich....decadent. Made two days in advance of an Xmas party. Even stuck to the original crust recipe (harder than using just crushed chocolate wafers, but worth it.)A keeper, and feeds many. Just a small thin slice is needed. Tip: Make sure cream cheese is at room temp for smoother blending. If you have a large stand mixer w/a paddle attachment, use that to mix.

The texture of this is wonderful!  Mine was quite loose in the middle after 55 minutes so I turned the oven off and left it in for an hour...perfect.  A small piece goes a long way.  Some guests thought it too much but others found it decadent and wonderful.  Definitely for chocolate lovers!  I liked it better after 48 hours in the fridge.  Great make ahead.  Will probably make again.

Speaky as a chocohalic, this is wonderfull!! It remindes me of the Hagen Daz Chocolate cheesecake ice cream! This will cure any craving! It is also very easy to make. However, this is my first cheesecake and I wasn't sure when to take it out of the oven; I took it out when the middle didn't "jiggle" anymore when it was moved. Make sure to cut it with a metal spatula that has been run under hot water first. Other then that, Enjoy!!

I made this with free cream cheese and eggbeaters and only used less than 1 cup of choc chips. it was delicious but i prefer plain cheesecakes more i think. i liked the cheesecake topping on top of the brownie caramel cheesecake better i think! but that's probably just personal preference.  if you like chocolate cheesecakes you might like irish cream cheesecake on this site more (my bf loves it) i had a bite and it seemed better than this one.  but overall this is a good cheesecake :) if you make it with fat free products it's more mousse like - not as firm.

Not the best. It didn't take like a fudge truffle. This was cheesecake with a chocolate flavour. Try adding whipped cream, caramel sauce, and carmelized nuts.

I used a homemade sweetened condensed milk and Guittard extra dark chocolate chips in this recipe--I made no other changes. I read through some of the top reviews before I made this dessert. I made this last night but let it cool in the cooling oven for an hour before pulling it out. It also had last night and most of today to chill out in the fridge before I cut it and served it. I thought that using sweetened condensed milk would make it too sweet but it really was just right. Uh......it's half gone. We all LOVED this "cheesecake". You can't even tell I didn't use a canned sweetened condensed milk! I'm SO making this again.

The cheesecake tastes like chocolate mousse.  I have never made a cheesecake or even used a spring form pan before.  I am the world's worst baker and was surprised this turned out.   The only problem was when I undid the spring form, the sides of the cake stuck to the pan causing a huge rip in the cake by pulling it apart. Not sure what I did wrong?  Directions did not say to grease the pan or flour it? UPDATE:  I have since learned it helps to lightly grease it before putting the cookie crust and filling inside the pan.  Also, to run a knife around the inside of the springform pan/baked cake before releasing it from the pan. I took this to work and people raved over it....only complaint was it was really rich....which didn't stop my Sergeant from eating two slices!!

Cheesecake Newbie here! I tried to wait the full hour to cool but didn't. Waited 50 minutes and had to have a slice. Very rich & smooth! Wish I had some cool whip to go with it to cut some of the chocolate flavor.

I made this for Easter and it was a huge hit! I used Oreo cookies instead of vanilla wafers for the crust, and it came out great. I topped it with some Cool Whip and crushed Oreos. It was perfectly chocolately and a nice consistency. I will definitely be making this again!

Yummy. Very sweet. Not much of a cheesecake flavor, IMO. Just creamy chocolate. I used bittersweet chocolate and it was still really sweet. It is extremely rich and a small piece topped with freshly whipped cream is perfect. Made this for my moms birthday one year and was driving up to see her in my friends Lexus. Got into an accident and totalled the Lexus. My first thought was "My cake!!!!" Well, it had been smashed along with the car. I still took it to moms party. Showed up with a smashed cake in a smashed car. It tasted awesome!!! No one cared about how it looked. And my friend was amazingly forgiving...

Fantastic, rich cheesecake.  I changed it a little, used 1 cup semi sweet chips and 1 cup milk chocolate chips.  Also folded in one bag toffee chips at the end before baking.  Baked 58 minutes(gas oven) and left in oven with door cracked for about 45 minutes.  Delicious!

I made this for my best friends birthday. She was blown away and said it was better than fancy restaurant cheesecake.  It had a small crack which I covered with a chocolate "R" for her name.  This was my first cheesecake.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year, along with another pumpkin dessert.  Of the two, this one was the hit!  I made a standard graham cracker crust, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I do think the baking time is way off, hence my lower rating.  My cheesecake was still really soupy after 55 minutes, so soupy that I baked it an additional 15 or 20 minutes.  As suggested by a number of reviewers, I then turned off the oven and let it sit in the oven for another hour.  My cheesecake cracked just a bit, probably due to my additional baking time.  I would make this again, but I would skip the additional 15-20 minute baking time.  I served this with raspberry sauce and whipped cream.  Very well received!

Very good. Husband loved it. Daughter said she could only eat a small bite due to the heaviness and overwhelming chocolate. Me? I am in between - it is very good but be warned - a tiny slice is best otherwise you may not feel well - it is that heavy and rich. I followed to a T and left in oven with oven off and door ajar for about 45 minutes...this was perfect - and no cracks!

Amazing cheesecake. Followed the recipe exactly and I wouldn't change a thing. DO NOT buy pre-made crust, make it according to this recipe, it's totally worth it. I brought this to my friend's personal shower, and she forgot to tell me that her mom was also making chocolate cheesecake. Let's just say way more of mine got eaten than hers ;)

YuuuMMMY!!! (( this is actually a recipe from Taste of Home)) Made no changes to the ingredients.  I dont like springform pans, so I make cheesecake in a regular 9 inch round cake pan.  I did bake this in a water bath for 55 minutes, then turned oven off for one hour, then kept the door ajar for another hour, perfect and NO cracks.  This cheesecake is amazing if youre both fan of chocolate and cheesecake..my husband who says he doesnt like cheesecake...ate 3 pieces in one day :)

I have made this probably 10 times and definitely think that the flavor is WAY better a few days after making it & letting it sit.  I always increase the crust by 50% too.  Hopefully this helps!

This was delicious and very easy to make!   I did cook it about 20 minutes longer than suggested, and then let it sit in the oven for another hour after I turned the oven off.  Maybe it needed the longer cooking time because I didn't have a glass pan...I'm not sure.  But it turned out perfectly!  It was a nice addition to Thanksgiving dinner.

This cheesecake is completely OUT OF THIS WORLD!  First time I made this, I followed recipe to the letter and it came out magnificently.  Neighbor came over and ended up taking half of it home.  The second time, I added extra chocolate chips to the mixture.  I made it for our Thanksgiving potluck dinner at work and every slice was eaten.  Comes out beautifully and is a masterpiece with chocolate sauce drizzled over top with whipped cream on top!

I just made this exact recipe from the Hershey Baking Book! I baked it with a pan of water below and it didn't crack or split. I saved a little batter and made a mini-cheesecake to taste-test and it was awesome!

I did not have a spring form pan so I tried putting this in a 9" square cake pan.  There was lot of extra filling leftover and I just happend to have a premade oversized graham cracker crust ("2 extra servings" size) and filled it as well.  Baked them both at the same time for the amount stated and then turned off the oven and let them sit in the oven for an hour before removing.  The result was two perfect looking cheesecakes.  Very rich in flavor.  We liked both crusts but the chocolate crust provided in this recipe was better.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

This is the first cheesecake I have made that didn't crack! It was beautiful and delicious. I used chocolate graham crackers with cocoa powder for the crust, instead of vanilla wafers. This was a great success!

Oh my. This is pretty much what heaven tastes like. I made it for me and my 5 college roommates and it lasted about an hour. I also discovered something amazing! I only have a 8-inch springform, so I had a bit of leftover filling. So i just placed an Oreo in the bottom of a paper-lined muffin tin cup and spooned the leftover filling on top. BEST MOVE EVER! The mini-cheesecakes are the perfect portion size and the Oreo makes a great crust.

This recipe is quite good though some people said it was too rich for them.  I have an insatiable sweet tooth so that wasn't a problem for me.  The crust in the recipe sounded a little odd so I made an Oreo crust instead.  I baked it exactly 55 minutes, turned off the oven and left it in for another hour with the over door open a little.  That did the trick with the cracks.  There wasn't a single crack and it also didn't sink in the middle (which usually happens to me when I use a springform pan).  So thanks to the other reviewers that had that suggestion.  Next time I don't think I'll bake it quite as long though because for me it was slightly overbaked on the edges, but the middle was very creamy.  Overall a very good recipe, but I doubt I'll make it very often because it is so rich for others and I don't want to eat the whole thing by myself!  Well actually I'd like to, but I don't want to be as wide as I am tall!

I'm giving it four stars because of the slight changes I made based on reviews.
I made this for my daughter's birthday party so the adults would have something sweet besides birthday cake.  I added a pinch of cinnamon and a pinch of cayenne pepper plus a tablespoon of brewed coffee.  I used bittersweet chocolate throughout.  I also used the brownie crust, as per reviews.  I froze it for 2 weeks and thawed it the day of the party.
It was fantastic!!!!!  The nine year old girls at the party preferred this cheesecake to the $30 fancy birthday cake!!!  It was amazing and highly recommended.

I made this twice and gave this 4 stars for a for a few reasons. 1: because the wafer base turned out yuck so i had to make it again and i used oreos instead. 2: because when made according to recipe it was too chocolatety so i changed it too 1/3 less and used dark chocloate 70% cocoa which made it yummy and also used only 2/3 of the condensed milk because its too sickly 3: it wasnt fudgey it was just cheesecake texture and i dont think there is anything you can do about it. Was yum once the kinks were ironed out.

I took this cake as a housewarming gift. Everyone loved it. It is a cheesecake for a true chocolate lover. I covered the cake with a chocolate ganache for a smooth looking cake and for a extra punch of chocolate.

Tonight our church named this cheesecake it's first place prize.  It was the very first time I've made a cheesecake from scratch.  It turned out perfectly.  It won the contest by a land slide.  I baked it for 55 minutes, then shut the oven off, cracked the oven door and allowed it to cool for 30 minutes in the oven.  I baked it over a pan of water.  At first I thought it was going to have a small crack but after it cooled it was perfect.  I drizzled each piece with a small amount of Hershey's syrup.  Although I did not try it, everyone else loved it.  Thanks...I'll be making this one again.

This came out beautiful to look at, but when bit into, it was VERY dense and VERY chocolaty. However, I am not a big fan of this one..it was much more truffle than cheesecake..maybe it just wasn't what I expected. A+ for apperance, C- for taste and texture.

This is a fabulous tasting cheesecake and very easy to make. However mine didn't quite set in the middle. I took it out after the 55mins but it remained gooey in the middle once it was cool. Next time I will increase the baking time by 20 mins.

WOW, Very Chocolatey!  I mixed milk and dark chocolate and I think I may have added a bit more than the recipe called for.  Next time I make it I'm going to serve it with strawberries or raspberries.  Very Trufflie:-)

WOW! As a certified chocoholic, I can say that this is _almost_ too chocolatey... but not quite. It is incredibly rich though, so start with thin slices. I used Pecan Sandies crumbs, which made the crust a little oily, but still yummy. Overall, a _delicious_ recipe that I will save for serious chocoholics. Thanks, Anne!

A sinfully scrumptious chocolate experience--deep, dense, and dark.  You must try this recipe!  I altered the cooking time and method a bit, based on other cheesecake recipes I have made: I baked it at 325 for about an hour and ten minutes, and then let it sit in the turned off oven for another hour; I also used a water bath.  I served the cake the next day with a raspberry sauce thickened with cornstarch, and topped each slice with homemade whipped cream.  This is an amazing dessert!

Yummy! I even used 1/3-less fat for part of the cream cheese, and it was still incredibly rich. Be sure to use high quality chocolate for both the chips and the powder. It was perhaps a bit too soft after baking for only 55 minutes (and cooling). Next time I'll cook it 5-8 minutes longer so it's a bit firmer.

Wow! This is sinfully good!!! I had the recipe quartered to one 8oz cream cheese block and the only other modifications were - added a bit more melted chocolate and a tablespoon of sour cream, and omitted the crust recipe. I made this into muffin size cupcakes and bottomed it with Oreo cookies [didn't even bother to crush them, etc]. Baked the cheesecake cups for about 25 mins. I couldn't wait any longer and tried one while it was still warm, topped with cherry pie topping - MMMMmmmmMMMMMMMmmmmm!!!! Definitely going to try the entire recipe soon.

Rich, creamy, decadent. Definately for the chocoholic! This recipe was quick and easy, but tastes like you spent hours in the kitchen. I used chocolate wafers in place of the vanilla ones because its all I had in the house. Got half way thru the preparation and realized what I thought was sweetened cond. milk wasn't.So I made my own (1 1/2cups dry powdered milk, 3/4 cup sugar, 1T butter, 1t vanilla and 1/2 cup cold water - one minute in the microwave on high - thickens as it cools).I'm not sure if this is the reason my cake turned out to be a firm mousse-like texture, rather than a heavy, dense, firmer cheesecake texture. Nonetheless, this was absolutely delicious. And in spite of my homemade sw. cond. milk, it brought many raves at our dinner party. I served with apricot sauce and a dollop of whipped cream. A gastronomic delight for sure! Thanks Anne.BTW - At 55 minutes, still a little jiggle to the center, came out of the oven looking slightly underdone, but firmed up as it cooled on the counter top.

This was easy and delicious!  Not like a regular cheesecake, so if that is what you are looking for, keep looking.  It does taste just like a fudge truffle.  The only thing I did differently was to use crushed chocolate wafer crumbs instead of the vanilla wafer/cocoa mix.  Much easier.  Also, it tastes even better the second day.  Great recipe.  Thanks.

This is WONDERFUL!!!  The sweetened condensed milk gave it a satin texture.  I am a cheesecake nut, and plan to try the same basic recipe without chocolate for the same texture in regular cheesecake.  Will let you know!!!  I topped by drizzling melted white chocolate on the top and added a couple of white chocolate leaves on it. (Melted chocolate painted on a CLEAN leaf, after hardened, peel leaf off)

Simple and wonderful!  Everyone always loves this recipe!!  And it turns out great every time!  I make an oreo crust using 2 cups.  On top I use a white chocolate shaving by just using a block of white chocolate and shaving it over the cake using a peeler.  This makes it looks wonderful using minimal time (approx. 60 seconds).  Make sure you allow several hours before taking this one anywhere! (it takes awhile to get firm) I was leary at first because it does not seem cooked in the middle, but it really will firm up if you leave it out.

Really good.  I used light cream cheese and it turned out great.  I turned off the oven when it was done and left it in there for an hour to keep it from cracking.  (I found that tip here at allrecipes.com).  I put it in the fridge overnight.  In the morning I put fresh raspberries on it and dribbled white and semisweet chocolate over the raspberries.  It was beautiful and tasted great.  Will make again.  Thank you Anne M.  Angela

This is THE (CHOCOLATE) CHEESECAKE.  THROW ALL OTHERS AWAY--THIS IS INCREDIBLE!!! I added a little almond-roca to the recipe instead of vanilla extract.  I also used peanut-butter and chocolate wafers instead of nilla wafers for the crust.  I served the dessert in two-slice portions with freshly melted milk chocolate drizzled over it.  I topped it with a spiral cone of whipped cream!  THIS IS THE BEST EVER!!!

Yowza!  Oh so rich and decadent!
My husband said "Wow - I've heard of death by chocolate, but this is murder by chocolate!"
This cheesecake is definitely of the quality to be served at a finer restaurant.
I enjoyed it in moderation - and would make it again for a large gathering (since a small amount goes such a long way).

FANTASTIC! DECADENT! These are the most common expressions from anyone that has had this after I've made it. Now for the hints, mods, and the steps I follow in their order. It is vital that all ingredients are at room temp. 
MODS: 2 c. vanilla wafer crumbs (I use a whole box of Nilla brand), 1/2 c. unsweetened cocoa powder (I use Hershey's Special Dark 100% cacao powder*), 2/3 c. confectioners sugar, 1/2 c. unsalted butter, I use a 50-50 mix of semi-sweet and dark chocolate chips* (both Ghirardelli brand).
*We prefer a dark chocolate taste.
STEPS:
1. I pre-fluff the cream cheese using a handheld electric hand mixer. Scrape down the sides with a spatula then set this aside for later.
2. I use a food processor to make the vanilla wafer crumbs, add 1/4 of the box at a time, pulse until all are uniform and fine.
3. Still in the FP, I add the cacao powder then sugar and blend.
4. Pulse in the butter a tsp at a time.
5. Move the crust into the springform pan. HINT: Use fingers and the bottom & sides of a small glass to evenly distribute and shape the crust. I find at least a 2-1/2" high sidewall is needed.
6. Back to the fluffed cream cheese to slowly beat in the eggs, then the can of milk, and vanilla. HINT: Use a slightly damp towel under the bowl to secure it from moving as you mix in the other ingredients.
7. Using a small ladle I slowly beat in the melted chocolate. HINT, I like to have a helper hold the hand mixer while I ladle and scrape.
8. Pour the batter into the ready cr

Incredible!!!  Rich, chocolaty, delicious crust.  Even people that don't like cheesecake (yes, there are such creatures in this world!) have only good to say about this one.  Give it a try.  You won't regret it!

This was amazing! And one of the easiest cheesecakes I've ever made.  I used a basic crumb crust (using chocolate graham crackers) and milk chocolate chips (it was all I had!) I baked as directed, but let it sit in the oven after I turned it off for about 20 minutes, then chilled overnight. My son who loves chocolate, but hates chocolate cheesecake couldn't get enough!!  Will definitely make this one again!

This was amazing! Way way better then any other cheesecake i've ever tried. My whole family loved it. Like other reviewers I left it in the oven with the oven off for a about an hour after the 55 minutes and it was perfect. Thanks for the great recipe!

**IMPORTANT** This recipe calls for a SPRINGFORM PAN.  I used standard tinfoil pie pans and if you are doing the same, HALF this recipe.  A Springform pan is very DEEP, you will have a TON of leftover filling.  Either that, or you will need to make 2 cakes.  ALSO IMPORTANT:  Use regular sugar in the crust.  I think this is the reason people are finding the crust unappetizing.  Confectioner's sugar (aka powdered sugar) is typically used for icings and sounds like it would make the crust horrible.  Followed the recipe, otherwise, exactly and it is fine, not dense or anything like other people have mentioned.  I think they are overcooking it.

This was delicious. It was pretty easy as far as cheesecakes go. I halved the chocolate chips, split the batter in half, and put the melted chocolate in half, and then put pumpkin in the other half. I did add a few tablespoons of flour to the batter. It turned out perfectly. It is super rich, so cut it small.

Great cake, great texture, very chocolatey. I would make this again in a heartbeat, because it's easy and has very few ingredients. I served it with some whipped creme and chopped nuts and it was a hit!

Awesome recipe! I'm a beginner in the kitchen and this recipe was very easy to follow! I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out great! I took it out of the oven at the time recommended in the original recipe and had no problems with cracking or being underdone. My dad, brothers, and boyfriend couldn't get enough! Will definitely make this again! Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this amazing cheesecake for my husband for Valentines Day....it is a new favorite in my house!!!  So yummy, very rich and decadent and most of all easy.  I served it with fresh whipped cream dusted it with cocoa and garnished with strawberries! Good on it's own, but even better with the cream and strawberries.  I've already passed the recipe on to several friends.  Do not hesitate giving this a try.

I was a bit disappointed because my cheesecake had a HUGE crack on it.. And it was falling apart while I was taking it out of the pan. But after refrigerating overnight, it turned out really well. Family was raving about it, saying how it was just as good as the ones in expensive restaurants!

seriously- sooo delicious!  I used my razzleberry preserves as a garnish and they made sweet music together.  I didn't have nilla wafers, and just used graham crackers and it turned out great.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  The only thing I did change was I baked it for 55 min, turned the heat off and left it in the oven for an hour.  It is VERY rich and very thick but its delicious.

Delicious, and perfectly dense. Very chocolately, so stay away if your not a big chocolate lover. I made an oreo crust, which worked very well. Creamy and delicious, will make again and again! Oh! And it didnt crack! Wow, its hard to find a recipe of a cheescake that doesnt crack, and Ive made plenty! Thanks for the recipe :)

This is a great recipe.  I have been making it for years and have been invited to many parties requesting that I bring it.  I also replace the chocolate chips with white chocolate, and have also used butterscotch chips.

This was my first cheesecake attempt and I couldn't get over how EASY it was!  After reading many of the review, I switched to the oreo crust.  Got lots of compliments on Christmas and everyone wanted the recipe... yes it's very rich but the name doesn't hid that, just take a conservative piece!

Decadent is probably the only way to describe this. Served at our company Christmas party with an oreo crust and dark chocolate ganache topping. Needless to say, I'm very popular with the coworkers! Plan on cutting very small pieces...it is that rich. Or plan on a chocolate-induced coma. Amazing!

This was so rich and creamy.  I brought it over to my friend's house and they raved about it.  The only thing I did differently from the recipe was add some cayenne pepper because I wanted a little kick.  So good.

Wow! This is so creamy and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly but I did bake the crust for 10 minutes before filling with the cheese mixture. Perfect! Thanks for the recipe.

This was a great chocolate cheesecake! If you are looking for something chocolatey, then is your ticket. I followed the recipe exactly except I 1 and 1/2'd the crust because I never seem to have enough crust. I also put a ganache topping on top (boiled 1 cup of 1/2 and 1/2 and about 9 ounces of semisweet chocolate chips, whisked them together and poured on top and put it in the fridge) Everyone raved about how yummy it was! It is very rich though and a small sliver of this cake goes a long way.

This was great, but I didn't love the crust.  I would try crushed Oreos for the crust instead of the vanilla wafers and cocoa next time.  I made a large cheesecake and two mini muffin-sized "testers" to decide whether it was better served cold or at room temperature.  For the testers, I used half an Oreo and they were much better than the big cake!  In general, it was a wonderful and easy recipe, but VERY rich, serve extremely small pieces as others recommended.  If I make this again it will be individual servings with Oreo crusts, yum!

Extremely easy to make and it turns out fabulous. Definately have to cut into small pieces because of how rich it is. I've made it twice and both times I wound up with a crack on top. Next time I'll try it with a water bath. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I used a brownie crust as well.  I purposefully underbaked the brownie before adding the cream cheese mixture since I knew the cheesecake would have to bake for almost 1 hour.  The brownie layer surprisingly stayed fudgy, and I wish I had lined the pan with some wax paper or parchment.  It was hard to get out.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and everyone thought it was dreamy.  I think this would taste good too with some instant coffee mixed in.                           UPDATE: I've made this a few times now, and if you're going to make a coffee version, replace the vanilla with coffee liquer to add depth.  I like fruit, so sometimes I'll make the recipe as is and top with a fruit puree.  The cheesecake is much better with a brownie crust though.  Once I made a large 14" cheesecake and doubled everything baking at 250F degrees for 90 minutes.  Let it cool in a slightly open oven for 1-2 hours.  You want the cheesecake to jiggle a little in the center because it will firm up when you refrigerate it.

Made this today for Thanksgiving dinner.  I wish we wouldn't have eaten so much dinner and gone straight to dessert!  This is awesome.  I left it in the cooling oven for an hour with a pan of water.  It was my first time making anything like this and it turned out fantastically!

Definite five stars!  So easy to make, and it came out perfect.  No cracks...just a very smooth-textured, creamy (yet dense) cheesecake with a wonderful flavor.  I made it for a small get-together everybody raved.  My husband, who likes cheesecake but isn't wild about it, really loved this.

I did keep it in the oven after it baked and to cool. That way it cooked all the way through very evenly and it didn't crack.

Thank you for sharing...this is awesome.

i have made this 3 times, and every time i make it everyone scarfs it down, so that i dont even get any! this was my official first baking experience from scratch, and i have to say, i was a little nervous. The batter and everything was fine (not that i would have known, i'd never made a cheesecake before), but when i put it in the oven, i realized that i wouldn't really know when it was done or not (if you insert a toothpick, of course it won't come out clean, its cheesecake). But the time the recipe says was perfect, so i took it out, and there was no cracking and it was perfect. It had to be chilled for about 3-5 hours, but once it was done i topped it with drizzled milk chocolate, and whipped cream, and it was FABULOUS!!! will be making this again and againnnnn :D

This was very good. I did let all my ingredients come to room temperature before I assembled the cheescake. I also followed the suggestions from others to allow the cake to sit in the oven after baking with the temperature off. This helped set the cake. I didn't have a single crack in the cake, it was beautiful. Thanks for sharing a great recipe.

This was an amazing cheesecake! I cooked a brownie mix in my sspringform pan first instead of the cookie crumb bottom (haha double the calories) and my guests loved it. Be sure to let the cake completely cool after taking this out of the oven or else the center won't set up! Will definately make again:)

VERY rich....maybe too much for some, but easy to make and very delicious, decadent, and chocolaty. This got rave reviews today from my teenage son and daughter (and her boyfriend), my husband, and my sister-in-law and her husband.  

Small portions are in order.  I used a nine-inch springform  pan and there are easily sixteen servings.

Considering the very basic ingredients and ease in making this...aside from the wickedly smooth rich chocolate flavor, this cheesecake is a winner.

Although I did not get to try this, the people that I gave to, as a gift, said it was outstanding (thus the 5 star rating. I did add 1 TBSP coffee liqueur, and used "special dark" cocoa, baked above a water bath",and drizzled dark choclolate over top for a nice presentation.

Very good and relatively easy to make.  Would recommend using a darker chocolate, for a richer chocolate flavor.  If you prefer a creamy cheesecake, you'll love this recipe.

I would give this one 10 stars if I could.  I have never made a cheesecake before and this one turned out perfect!  I did bake it with a water bath on the shelf below.  I also baked it late in the evening and allowed it to cool in the closed oven overnight.  Put it in the fridge the next morning and it was PERFECT!!  No cracks and very rich.  GREAT RECIPE!

This is THE BEST chocolate cheesecake ever! The only change I made was to substitute plain chocolate biscuits for the base to which I added just the melted butter.  Everyone commented on the super smooth texture. Fantastic!

Excellent, though I accidently only added 1/3 C Sweetened Condensed milk. I think it probably cut the richeness down. It was outstanding and got rave reviews. I used the Strawberry supreme topping recipe, but substituted rasperrries instead. I also let it chill over night.

The only better cheesecake that I had and maybe not much better was from the cheesecake factory. This was so good. It does definately have to chill almost 24hrs to throughly blend and settle. I tried some before this point because I couldn't wait, it was good, but nothing to rave about and then I waited and tried it. SOOO GOOD! I feel kind of guilty, because my mom couldn't make it to dinner at the in laws for Easter so I brought her back a piece along with csome other leftovers. I changed my mind and ate her piece. I can't wait to make this with different chocolate maybe white or milk. The possibilities are endless. Thanks for this great recipe.

Sinfully wonderful. A little piece really does go a long way. Like some others, I recommend letting the cake cool in the turned-off oven, and then refridgerating for at least 18 hours (defintely make the night before). I chose to drizzle some white chocolate on top and it added I very nice contrast. If you like cheescake and chocolate, you MUST try this!

wow. im only 15 years old and i made this cake for a french project. it was really delicious. everyone around me at school was asking me for soem of this rich chocolately cheese cake. i would absolutely make it all the time if i could. i made my own decorations on it by melting some chocolate chips, putting them in a plastic bag, cutting the tip of it, then squeezing out the melted chocolate into designs.

This was a very good cheesecake.  The texture was very smooth and velvety but not quite chocolately enough for my taste.  I nearly doubled the recc. amount of chocolate and it was perfect.  It's a keeper!

I made this last night, it is good, doesnt quite taste like a cheesecake or like a truffle, kind of a very bittersweet hard mousse cake. It needs something, either more cream cheese or more chocolate, it was good but not as good as everyone hyped it up to be, Will make again,but you definetly have to be in the mood for the taste of it....

I can't believe I haven't rated this yet! I have made this recipe quite a few times, always to RAVE reviews from my cheesecake-loving family.  I like to shave some milk chocolate slivers on top, then drizzle with some dark chocolate fudge sauce. You can use home-made, or Dove brand is quite good. It really dresses it up! This is definatly one of my favorite recipes EVER!

What a disappointment!  Made this cheesecake to take to a 4th of July picnic and ended up throwing half of it away.  It was was too 'chocolaty' and on the dense and heavy side.  I'd use a regular vanilla crust, cut the chocolate chips in half, and decrease the cooking time to 45 minutes.  Hope others have better luck with this than I did.

I needed to make a cheesecake for my husbands potluck at work and I had only made one cheesecake before in my life. So I was nervous about making one but then I ran across this recipe!  WHAT A HIT!!!!!!!! I made a oreo crust like someone else had suggested and it was a so good (I had my husband sneak me home a piece).  Thank you so much for this recipe, it is a keeper.

I made this yesterday for a dinner party we were going to and it was a HUGE hit!  It is worth the time, I promise!  Very creamy and delicious!  It didn't even crack like so many others that I've made.  I topped it w/ a light layer of white chocolate and it looked like it had been decorated by a professional.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for Christmas Dinner with my extended family and it was loved by everyone.  The only thing I did different was instead of using vanilla cookies to make the crust I used a Betty Crocker fudge brownie mix.  I put the cheese cake filling directly on top of the unbaked brownie mix and baked it according to directions in the recipe.  After letting it cool completely I topped it of with extra creamy cool whip.

Made this for the first time today and everyone was crazy over it!  I added a semisweet white chocolate drizzle and that really perfectly offset the richness of the cheesecake itself.  Extra vanilla as well (2 tbsp, I don't play around!)  I also used chocolate graham crackers in place of the wafers to save time, turned out fine and much easier.  

If you're like me and don't own any heat safe bowls to form a double boiler, you can totally melt the chocolate chips in a regular pot on the stove, just be sure to use very low heat and stir constantly until smooth in order to avoid scorching the chocolate.

I made this for the first time yesterday exactly as described to share with work friends and it was received with rave reviews all around.  The texture of the cake is firm, allowing the cake to stand up as nicely as any NY cheesecake.  A couple of people mentioned that they liked that it wasn't "too chocolatey."   Personally, I think it would benefit from an oreo crust and will try that next time.  After the 55 min at 300 deg F, I turned off the oven and let it sit in there for another hour.  When pulled out of the oven later, the middle looked a little soft, but, as mentioned in the original recipe, it was just fine at the end--no undercooked center at all.  I'm going to add it to my collection of recipes as a go-to for chocolate cheesecake.

I've made this recipe dozens of times now, and I've never had it fail (which cannot be said of any other cheesecake recipe I've tried).  Never cracks, never less than perfectly delicious.

I read a lot of the reviews before making this cheesecake.  This recipe was a HIT! It will now be my go-to dessert to share at parties!  The best tips I read, and utilized were the following:

- Bringing all ingredients to room temperature
- Adding one egg at a time to the mixture
- Do NOT use low-fat cheese
- Put a pan of water on the lower rack to help with moisture
-Letting the cake cool down in the oven for 55 minutes after baking
-Using a knife rinsed under hot water to cut each slide each time
-Letting the cake set in the fridge overnight
-Serving the cake cold! Not at room temperature.

I am a first time cheesecake maker and I had no cracks in my cake at all! It baked perfectly.  One thing I learned after my bake was that I should have buttered the sides of my springform pan.  The cake came off just fine but the sides probably would have looked smoother if I buttered the inside to help against sticking. Another thing I learned was that I should have pre-baked the crust for 10 minutes to make it extra crispy.  

Another necessary tip, in my opinion, is that you should make it a necessity to complement this recipe with the “Supreme Strawberry Topping” recipe from allrecipes.com. Everyone loved that! I also added the homemade chocolate sauce recipe from this site as well (see photo for both sauces on my cheesecake).

This has become my family’s favorite dessert. Even my husband, who avoids cheesecake at all costs, asks me to bake this for his birthday every year. Super highly recommend, with recipe as written. Sometimes I increase the crust by 50% to be able to build up the sides more. Also works well as mini-cheesecakes!

This was really, really good.  I made it for Valentines Day and my wife loved it as well.   I added Creme de Framboise (Raspberry Liqueur) and then topped it with a Raspberry compote along with whipped cream.   It turned out really well, and I will certainly make it again.

It’s a delicious cake and it’s very versatile. For Mother’s Day I used this recipe but didn’t add cocoa powder and was able to make a Lemon Raspberry Cheesecake, with a few minor adjustments.

This was excellent! I followed the recipe exactly; it definitely looked underdone when I took it out of the oven but it wasn't by the time it had cooled off. It really wasn't difficult and tastes great, in the opinion of the whole family. I will make this again.

This cheesecake is fantastic! Wonderful cheesecake consistency and flavor! My husband wished the crust was a bit more "chocolaty," but I thought it was just right. I made it just as the instructions were written. Wouldn't change a thing. Didn't even have one crack!  I sent half of the cheesecake to work with  my husband and the men devoured it!!!

The Fudge Truffle Cheesecake was fabulous. I gave it to several friends and we all agreed it was great eating!
It makes many servings so it’s a recommendation for a marvelous dessert for a dinner party. Making it the day ahead would help the cook and give the cake a chance to set up properly.
Oh,  there were no substitutes—

Rich, delicious, and chocolatey.  I used a  10-inch pan and it came out fine.  I did not adjust amounts of ingredients, but I did have  a pan of water underneath in the oven, and I let it cool off in the oven with the door part open.  It came out smooth, no cracks, and looking beautiful.

I made the recipe as stated. I used some of the suggestions from previous reviewers about leaving it in the oven while it cooled down. .The cheesecake was very rich and chocolaty. It was a hit at the Prayer and Soup dinner at my church. I will make again. Very easy recipe with no unusual ingredients (sour cream, heavy cream)

UPDATE: I have made this several times since my first and I have decided that a vanilla wafer crust is the best. I love chocolate but the chocolate wafer or brownie crust is over the top for me (never thought I'd say that!). I still give it 5 stars - and SO SIMPLE to make!

Decadent!  I followed the advice of some reviewers and used a brownie bottom, I think next time I make this (and there WILL be a next time!) I'm going to stick with the usual cracker crust.  To me, the brownie crust was WAY overdoing it...and that's saying a lot because I LOVE chocolate and I don't think I've ever said those words.  Perhaps I'll do the 'nilla wafers or maybe I'll use chocolate graham crackers.  I also decided to do a swirl of raspberry coulis...nothing goes better with chocolate truffle than raspberry!  Despite my changes, it's clear that this recipe - even when followed as written - is a HUGE winner!

I really liked this. It didn't have a really "cheesecake" flavor.  It was chocolate more than anything else.  I loved it, my husband said he prefers a regular cheesecake with chocolate chips over this one.  Too bad I'm the one who bakes... ;)

Absolutely amazing! It was my very first time trying a cheesecake, and it won't be my last! It was so decadent and sophisticated!

It was good, but VERY rich. I could hardly finish a decent sized slice because it was so rich and chocolately (and I LOVE chocolate!).

Recipe neglected to mention that the melting chocolate needs constant stirring or else it becomes gritty and crunchy. So I now have a "chocolate crunch" cheesecake.. it could be worse, though. If I had known this than I'm sure the recipe would have been great. AND take the cheesecake out of the oven, I don't know why people said leave it in. Mine is not cracked!

What a winner!  This was easy & a huge crowd pleaser.  It's very rich but some fresh whipped cream solved that problem, easy!  Next time I make it (and there WILL be a next time!!) I will let it sit out for 20 minutes before slicing. I used a 10" springform pan because that's all I had and found that is was high enough. Other than the size of the pan I followed the recipe exactly. I crushed the vanilla wafers in the blender and that worked out fine. What a delicious & simple cheesecake!

AWESOME!  I made this as a "test" to see if I wanted to add it to my desserts list.  I have a small baking business here in Costa Rica.  According to all of my friends and neighbors who were my taste testers this one is a keeper!  It is extremely rich and dense - a small piece goes a long way.  As others have stated, make sure that ALL ingredients are at room temperature prior to pulling it together.  The result will be so much creamier.  I would serve this with only a small dollop of lightly sweetened whipped cream as anything else might be a little on the "too sweet" side.  Enjoy!

I absolutely loved this cheesecake! I made it twice, however, because the first time, I processed the vanilla wafers with the sugar, but the crust came out too mushy. The next time, I used finely crumbled oreos with some butter and it was perfect! I also substituted the semi-sweet chocolate chips for dark chocolate chips. I served it with strawberries and fresh whipped cream, entered it in a Bake-Off and won first place! Thank you very much.

Amazing cheesecake - once cooled completely the texture is very dense and fudge-like. I used chocolate animal crackers for the crust and swapped the confectioners sugar for granulated sugar and melted the butter in order to more easily press the crust into the pan. I used 60% cacao chips instead of milk chocolate. I put a pan of water in the oven with my cheesecake and then baked for 55 minutes, left in oven for 1 hour, and then refrigerated for one hour. It was beautiful - no cracks. I'll make again and garnish with ganache, powdered sugar, whipped cream, or strawberries.

I made the recipe as written with the exception of using a Betty Crocker Gluten Free Brownie mix for the crust due to Celiac disease.  I used a 10 inch springform pan.  I baked the cheesecake for 55 minutes at 300 degrees and then turned the oven off and left it in for about 10 minutes.  Unfortunately, due to the bigger pan size, the cheesecake was overbaked.  45 minutes at 300 degrees and being promptly removed from the oven would have been perfect.  The three star rating is not due to the cooking times. It's for the flavor of the cheesecake.  For my family and me, the flavor was three stars at best - none of us were overly impressed.  Will keep looking for the perfect recipe. Probably won't make this one again.

I've had a lot of cheescake in my day...this one is the best!!! My first attempt at making any cheescake (that wasn't the instant kind), and it turned out great! A few things I changed. I put it in 2 keebler graham cracker pie crusts, the choc kind of course. Still had filling left over. And I just heated the chocolate chips in the microwave. Make sure cream cheese is at room temperature adn I also adjusted cooking time down to 40 min for both of the smaller cakes I made.

Instead of vanilla wafers I make brownies from a recipe on here and press them into the pan while they are still hot...then I fill as instructed and bake. Absolutely phenomenal. And I drizzle with melted white chocolate :)

I'm not sure 'fudge' is an appropriate description and actually forgot it wasn't called chocolate truffle cheesecake instead.  This is the first one I've ever tried and quite good, but next time I'll probably fine some way to make it more chocolatey, to stand up to its name.

Fantastic recipe!  This cheesecake turned out light, creamy and very tasty.  I dressed it up with broken chocolate squares, fresh raspberries and a dusting of powdered sugar.  It looked really pretty.

Very good, but very very very rich.  The word fudge is very appropriate in describing the cheesecake as it had a similar density.  Excellent taste, but be sure to cut the pieces small.

I made this for my husband’s birthday using 2 fat free, and 1 low fat cream cheese, fat free sweetened condensed milk, and egg whites only. I took the advice of other reviewers and made an Oreo cookie crust. I topped with fresh strawberries, and fresh made whipped cream. It was fantastic! My husband said it was "seriously addictive", and he wasn't kidding! We celebrated his birthday on a Saturday afternoon, and this was gone by Monday afternoon! This says something because my husband does not have a sweet tooth, and he isn't that big of a chocolate fan either! This cheesecake was just that good! I even got requests from friends to make this for them on their birthday!

Fantastic cheesecake - great for Valentines Day!   Cut the recipe in 1/2 (2 people) and used smaller springform pan (45 min bake).  Changed the base - ground Oreo cookies with a handful of pecans and a couple tbsp of melted butter.  Used Ghiradhelli Semi-Sweet chips, "light" cream cheese, low fat sweetened condensed milk.  Served with whip cream and raspberries. To die for recipe - it replaced Chantal's NY Cheesecake as our favourite.

Fabulous! I made this for Christmas Day, my mother (the best cook ever) was upset because everyone chose this one over her homemade cobbler. Very, very rich. Super fudgey chocolately, very silky, no cracks. I served it with fresh whipped cream piped on top. Everyone just loved it. Thank you!

WOW!  There are no words to describe how delicious this is.  I made it for Thanksgiving on my husbands side of the family.  My mother-in-law does not usually like cheesecake but she wanted to try it because it was chocolate.  She loved it and asked me for the recipe.  That is huge.  Everyone else loved it too.  It's very creamy and although it's rich, it's also light.  I don't know how to describe it.  It was just an amazing cheesecake.  I decorated it with white chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate.  I would definitely recommend using a really good semisweet chocolate in the recipe.  You have to try this recipe.

Made this for Thanksgiving.  This was so yummy!  For years I have tried many different cheesecake recipes and have always been disappointed.  This was incredible.  I did leave out the cream cheese and eggs so they were at room temp, and also placed the condensed milk in warm water.  This made for a very smooth cheesecake.  I also made sure not to over mix and cooked with a water bath.

This cheesecake was amazing! It was the first time I ever made cheesecake, and it turned out great. I put store-bought truffles on the top, alternating white chocolate and milk chocolate around the edges, and it looked very pretty. And it tasted even better! So creamy and chocolaty an delicious. Remember to refrigerate it for at least a few hours before serving, though.

This was an amazing cheesecake!!  I did make two minor changes.  I used my regular oreo crust instead of the recipe crust, and I added a chocolate ganache topping when it was cooled.  It was divine!!!

Awesome cake! Gave 4 stars due to the crust, wasn't all that great! I will try again with the Brownie crust others have recommended.

This was so beautiful. Looked like a professional cake. Everyone loved it. Next time I will use dark chocolate chips for a richer chocolate flavor. I used the brownie crust and chocolate ganache like another reviewer and that was perfect.

made individually in foil wrappers with an oreo as the bottom. It was good, but it would be better as a whole cheesecake instead.

Wow, really rich, a little goes a long way.  I made an oreo crust and it was a great combo.  I let everything come to room temp, and let it sit in the off oven for a hour, but i still got a fairly big crack- so i topped it with ganache.

I made this for my chocolate loving niece's birthday. I live in the UK and wasn't sure what vanilla wafers were so I used digestive biscuit crumbs. I cooked this in a water bath and left it in the cooling oven for a couple of hours. Drizzled white chocolate over the finished cake. A very big hit. Thanks Macs

AMAZING recipe! It does make a lot, though; I ended up having a huge 9-inch cheesecake and another smaller one. I might reduce all the ingredients by 1/3 next time.

Awesome!! This was the first ever cheescake I made!! It was very creamy. Not overly rich. The cookie crust wasn't quite right to me. It tasted good, but I think I would prefer a grahm cracker crust.  I will definitly make again!!!

Delicious!..  I let it sit in the oven for an hour after baking and it looked perfect..  Served with whipped cream.  Mine was very thick, so I think you can use a 10" springform pan if you have one!..  I also used 1 pkg of Ghirradeli chips which is 12 oz.  I'd like to try it with the two cups next time!

Delicious and very easy to make!  The texture is just fabulous--very moist and smooth.  Like others, I shut off the oven and left the cheesecake in it for another hour after the initial baking time.  It was perfect!  I also made a brownie crust, as suggested in another review, and it was a great compliment to the cheesecake!  I coated my cheesecake with the Chocolate Ganache recipe from this website.  Very, very yummy, and very, very rich--just a little slice will be sufficient!  This was the perfect Valentine's Day dessert! (though it would work any time you really want to wow people without a lot of work!)

This was a bit too sweet for me and my family.  I followed the recipe exactly and the crust turned out okay - not mushy, but some of the other mentioned crusts (oreos or brownies) might be better.  I won't be making this again, although I should mention that we're not huge cheesecake fans to begin with.

This is the best chocolate cheesecake I have ever made or eaten. Made for the holiday potluck at work and got rave reviews. I did use the oreo crust though. Followed the recipe exactly outside of that. 
Thank you for sharing!

Awesome recipe. My husband is very picky, and this is his favorite cheesecake by far! I did change it up by using an oreo crust, from "chocolate cookie cheesecake" by Millie Ellis on this site. Let ingredients come to room temp & it turns out perfect every time!

Rating the filling only.  After reading other reviews I decided to use my trusty crushed oreo crust.  Made it into mini cheesecakes in my silicone mini muffin pans and they turned out perfectly!  Love this recipe!

I am not a fan of chocolate, but my fiance is a choc-o-holic so I decided to make this for him.  I actually thought it was good, and he loved it!  I didn't have a springform pan or sweetened condensed milk, so I just used 2 regular pie pans and heavy whipping cream with a little extra sugar.  Still turned out great!

Made this once, using brownie mix. YUM!! I do suggest using parchment paper on bottom of pan. Makes things a lot easier. Other than that, this recipe is perfect! Very beginner friendly. Am making again using graham cracker crust.

This is the first recipe that i've rated 5 stars. I'm not a proffessional in baking but this cake made me feel like i am! I actually made a small mistake by mixing the condesned milk last but looks like it didnt matter. I used Mc'Vities digestive biscuit for the crust and it was yummy. I decorated the top with leftover chocolate mousse and ganache. Sounds fattening? I couldn't care less!!! It tasted so good and heck... we only live once.

Whoa is this stuff fantastic! 10 stars all the way. I actually used crushed oreos for the crust instead, so much easier. I also had to use reduced fat cream cheese (all I had on hand) and it still turned out to be the richest cheesecake I've ever had! So sinfully delicious.

This cake was delicious but very rich. Garnished with whipped cream and strawberries for Easter dessert.  Only thing I changed was the crust.  Instead of the crust given, I crushed up some chocolate wafers and mixed with a little butter.

Great Recipe! My Husband LOVED it. It came out perfect, no cracks when I left it in the oven for about an hour after it finished baking. The only thing I'll do different next time is try the brownie crust some of the others mentioned because the crust to me was too crumbly and just didn't taste very good. Otherwise this is an excillent dish and I will definately make it again!

i made this shortly before valentine's day because i really, really wanted to make something and i really, REALLY wanted some chocolate.

and i am so very happy i did.  it was amazing.

i used a premade 9" oreo crust, which left me with a ridiculous amount of batter left over...but was that a problem?  not with a spoon and the bowl, it wasn't.  :)  and in a lot of ways, the batter was tastier than the cheesecake.

anyway, this is awesome and a permanent fixture in my recipe book.  thanks!

I have made this at least two times so far, and people have given me great compliments on it.  I think something to remember is that if you put quality ingredients in, it will be that much better, like Godiva chocolate and Valrhona cocoa powder instead of Toll House and Hershey's - much more expensive, but worth it!  I made a brownie crust for one try, and that was extra superb!

Wonderful.  I used a chocolate grahm cracker crust and I added a layer of fresh raspberries in the middle.  I topped it with raspberry sauce and white chocolate shavings.  Beautiful.

Outstanding!!!  This cheesecake is simply divine - very rich, very creamy and exceptionally chocolate, just like rich fudge truffles.  My hubby said it was the best cheesecake he has ever eaten.  

Once it was completely cool and set, I drizzled melted chocolate over the top for a more elegant look.

I didn't put my cheesecake in a waterbath and I only got 1 crack in my cheesecake.  This looked great and got phenomenal reviews at DH's work and many requests for the recipe.  I will keep this recipe on reserve for special occassions (or just cravings).

I topped it with a chocolate ganache, chocolate dipped strawberries, and chocolate shavings. I didn't get to try the cheesecake myself, but it looked amazing and the friend who I gave it to for christmas gave it some rave reviews! I will definatly have to make this again to try it for myself.

Easy, and delicious. I have even substituted 1/3 cup peanut butter for the melted chocolate... covered it with chocolate ganache. Perfect either way. Thank you for this recipe.

Absolutely amazing. I released the spring form pan way too early - I guess you're supposed to let cheesecakes sit for a long time before serving. Oops! Tasted great in any event. Served with strawberries to cut the richness.

This cheesecake was delicious.  I served it for dessert for Easter dinner.  My brother who is not a sweet eater said it was excellent and had a second piece.  My husband thought the chocolate crust was a bit hard.  I will definately be making this one again.

I took this to a potluck as the dessert and everyone was impressed.  I made sure the cream cheese was at room temperature before I started.  My cheesecake was a little soft in the middle, so next time I will leave it in the oven for an hour extra after it is turned off as per other reviewers.  Very rich-definately for chocolate lovers!

I'm stunned that we didn't like this.  Although I used a good cocoa, the crust was very bitter and strange tasting.  If I made this again I would use the crust from the chocolate chip cheesecake I recipe by Jessica.

It was delicious but almost too rich for my taste (I can't believe I am saying that!).  For some reason my crust separated from the cheesecake - I think I pressed it too hard in the springform pan as there did not seem to be enough butter to get it to stick well without really pressing it together.  Crushing up vanilla wafers is a bit time consuming also.  Overall everyone loved it but many commented it was a little bit too rich.

In a word, AWESOME!!!!  I made this for a family gathering last month.  People were fighting for the last piece!!!  It was that good!!  Very rich and smooth...everything a chocolate cheesecake should be.  Keep in mind that I got out the "fancy" chocolate for this recipe.  And it was an absolute hit!  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks, Anne!!

I was going to revise my plain cheesecake recipe to make it chocolate, but when I saw 37 ratings I figured why mess with success!  So happy I used this recipe! I left it in about 10 minutes longer and it did crack, but I melted milk chocolate and coated the top, then sprinkled heath toffee bits over it.  After it was refrigerated it was just like a super chocolaty candybar.  My husband and company raved.  thanks!

I took this to a baby shower and got rave reviews.  I also did graham cracker crumbs instead of wafters and I used 1 tsp Vanilla and 1 tsp Almond extract after reading other reviews.  Two people asked me if I put Amaretto in it!   I used 16oz of the 1/3 fat cream cheese and 8oz regular cream cheese.  Came out perfect.  I will make again.

Great recipe!  I substituted 1 1/2 tsp. of almond extract for the vanilla and topped it with a strawberry sauce and got rave reviews!

I made this cheesecake twice for Holiday parties. It's been a hit both times. The second time I used an oreo cookie crust and I thought it was even better. I topped it with white chocolate and semi-sweet chocolate. Everybody wanted to know where I bought it!

This was incredible! I wasn't sure if I cooked it long enough..it was still loose in the middle but wasn't sure if it was just supposed to be that way.  Ofcourse I had it still a bit warm..just couldn't wait. I will make this again!

This is a great recipie. I added a thick fudge frosting to the top to make this a chocolate sin cake. When you serve this everyone at the table feels guilty.

This was a huge hit and it looks better than any other cheesecake I have ever made. It doesn't crack ontop like so many do. It is HUGE!! So plan for company when making it.

Possibly the best chocolate cheesecake I've ever had!  So smooth and delicious.  I'm sure my co workers would have liked it but I'm hoarding it all for myself.

I loved it, but I couldn't eat it fast enough! My husband didn't find it sweet enough for his taste. Next time, I think I'll use graham crackers for the crust instead of Nilla Wafers.

I made this cake for the family and they liked it, but at my office it was a hit!
I even had a pregnant mommy asking for the recipe, and quickly, she wasn't coming to work in a little bit and she could' do without it.

My family and scrapbooking group loved it. It is creamy and chocolately. What more could you want. Tastes great with a graham cracker crust too.

Absolutely divine; everyone loved it and my husband asked if we could rename it "Chocolate Or***m".  I said yes.  It is unbelievably creamy.  I added in 1 tsp. of orange extract (instead of vanilla).  I also used low-fat sweetened cond. milk and 1 pkg of 1/3 less fat cream cheese; it was still rich (as cheesecakes are meant to be).

This is a very easy to make and delicious recipe!
Everyone in my house loved it... But for me only one cup of semisweet chocolate chips (for the filing)was just fine...

This was the second time I've ever made a cheesecake.  It turned out great! My family loved it, I'll be making it again.
