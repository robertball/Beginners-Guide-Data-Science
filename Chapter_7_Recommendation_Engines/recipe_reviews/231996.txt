I used 4 bags of microwave popcorn and could have easily added another for the amount of topping there was.  I also used two large bowls and two cookie sheets to help out with the amount of popcorn there was.  We used 2 Sharkleberry Kool-aid packets and the kids loved it.  It was good to me but not great and I am sure it is because of the flavor packet I used.  I think one packet would have been better.  Great recipe though to play with the flavors. Thanks for posting!
