Thank you for sharing the recipe, I thought they were really good. 
I had never tried Jicama, so I made 3 recipes that I found, and this was
my favorite.   I added some pam spray and sea salt at the end and they were great.

Had a ton of jicama left over and when I found this recipe, I thought, "What do I have to lose?"  I followed the recipe exactly, microwaved it 4 minutes to start, then checked at 2 minute intervals.  I squirted a little cooking spray on the "fries" after they were done, and lightly salted them.  The fish I served them with had a nice tomato-ey sauce, and this really made the "fries" yummy.  So maybe ketchup would not be amiss.  I will definitely make again when I have jicama left over.

Was quite surprised how yummy this was.  Sprinkled with a little salt and they tasted almost like french fries.

Being a low carber I really miss french fries, so tried these as a sub. They were delicious.
I cooked as written in the microwave for 11 minutes, and then dusted them with a bit of salt  and a dash or two of Malt vinegar. Served them with fried cod and mushy peas...English style.
Thank you for sharing the recipe, Darren---it's a keeper.

This took closer to 15 min and never got nice "zebra" stripes. It was chewy and the kids hated it. My husband and I thought it was just ok. I'm gonna try roasting them in the oven next time

I followed the recipe exactly and indeed got stripes. They tasted like french fries that had been left in the car. Considering they were jicama, I consider that a 5 star win.
