Let me start out by saying that I am NOT fond of Swiss cheese. That being said this was a fantastic recipe and a hit at our table. The only changes made were very minor. I pre-diced the chicken before pan frying just to eliminate the cool down time before I could safely handle the cooked chicken. I also used a 9x13x2 inch baking pan as it didn't look like it would all fit into the specified pan. AND just to make it more colorful I used the tri-colored pasta and used red and orange peppers instead of the green pepper which my family does not like. This would make a lovely presentation for guests and I will be making this again.

Made this last night exactly as it's written and loved it! My picky roomate even enjoyed it and went back for seconds! We used an italian cheese blend instead of Swiss. We will be making this again!

I changed rotini noodles in for elbow macaroni and the swiss cheese to motzerella cheese. This way was the BOMB! Instead of frying the chicken i boiled it with a little bit of garlic and onion powder. I'm telling you it was one of the best dinners I ever made!

I did not care for this at all but most of my family liked it okay so that is why I am giving it 3 stars. I made it as the directions stated and it was very boring and dry. Needs more flavors and more liquid or sauce or something. I also think 1 lb of cheese was too much. I recommend covering with aluminum foil as that maybe would have helped it from drying out so much in the oven (the top noodles got stale and crunchy). Even still it needs more liquid.

This is a hard one for me to review because in an attempt to be a bit healthier we cut down on the cheese drastically which may be why this was rather lackluster for us and probably negated the whole Philly aspect this was going for. We used 1 green and 1 yellow bell pepper 1 onion and added some mushrooms and 2 small chopped zucchini to up the amount of veggies. I think we were a bit shy of 1 lb of chicken and we used 14 oz pasta which still felt like too much. So ours really came out more as a Chicken Pasta Primavera. Not a lot of flavor despite trying to punch it up with a dash of cayenne and other spices like Italian seasoning etc. We ended up adding sriracha or hot sauce to our bowls. Having said that I would make this again the way I did as an inoffensive way to eat light and get some good veggies in. I would just experiment with more spices to kick it up. Sorry for the neutral review when i didn't follow the recipe super closely but this just didn't have enough flavor for us as written.

After reading reviews I was nervous to make this dish but it used ingredients I had so I made it anyway. I did make some changes- I used 1/2 the pasta and only 4 oz of swiss cheese. I aslo cut the chicken into strips before I cooked it (reducing the cooking time and I didn't have to take it out of the pan once it was cooked) in the skillet and seasoned it well with seasoning salt garlic salt garlic powder and italian seasoning. I cooked the onion in the skillet with the chicken rather than removing the chicken and adding it again later. I also skipped the oven all together. After the pasta was boiled and the chicken and onion cooked I put the water and bouillon in and added the noodles then shredded the swiss into the pan and mixed it until the cheese melted. Less dishes and less hassle if you ask me. It isn't anything like a philly cheese steak but it yummy and I like the swiss flavor that comes out.

I add extra peppers and onions... we LOVE them. I also used provalone with a little bit of shredded cheddar. Mushrooms would be good as well. Very good and easy to make. Will make again. Yummmo!

The combination of ingredients was absolutely delish but I also seasoned a little more with Italian seasoning; and instead of baking the cheese over it I made a cheese sauce and poured it over it. The onions and peppers added a nice kick to it. I also blackened the chicken for a more rustic taste. Definitely something quick and easy once you tweak it a little.

My husband and I loved this! After reading other reviews saying it was dry I did add a tablespoon of the chicken base and about 2 cups of water the only other thing I would add would be mushrooms.The leftovers were even better the next day and it really does taste like a chicken philly too!

I used orange and yellow bell peppers instead of green peppers. This dish came out somewhat bland and dry. I ended up making a sauce with cream cheese to mix in.
