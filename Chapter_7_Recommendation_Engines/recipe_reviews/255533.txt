As-is, it was okay. Once I added a teadpoon of espresso powder, it was *amazing.* If you don't have espresso powder, coffee powder could work, or just brew strong coffee and use that in place of water. Can't wait to eat this with cookies, fruit, and pretzels!

I use  2Tbsp maple syrup or honey, in place of the sugar. I also used Dutch chocolate as I have never found dark cocoa powder.

Thanksgiving 2019 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/255533/brownie-batter-dip-aka-chocolate-hummus/ ...  'Liked this.  I replaced peanut butter with creamy sunflower butter; regular cocoa for dark.  'Didn't blend the chickpeas smooth, but should have; maybe chunky sunflower butter for a li'l texture.  I'll also add espresso powder as another reviewer suggested.  A little goes a long way - meaning serves more than ya may think.  
 'Served with pretzels.  SuzyQ, are ya reading this?  'Not the same as a baked brownie, but a girl needs some chocolate!

perfect dessert or appetizer dip!  I used almond butter instead of peanut butter, and used a combination of maple syrup (2 T) and coconut sugar (4T), with the result being just a little less sweet than original recipe.  Served with whole wheat water crackers  and thin ginger cookies, along with a side of berry salad.  Nothing left to take home!
