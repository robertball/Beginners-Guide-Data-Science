This is an absoltely addictive chutney, with layers of flavor. I substitued craisins for raisins, and used two whole cinnamon sticks, 10 whole cloves, a nub of fresh ginger and a sprinkle of cayenne for heat. I also reduced the vinegar just slightly, but don't think that is necessary. Once the chutney sits and the flavors meld, the vinegar flavor really mellows out. I'm making another huge batch of this for Christmas gifts today!

I have made this cranberry relish for 4 years now, with excellent results every time.  I use the recipie as written, with fuji apples.  The only thing different is that I simmer for much longer than 10 minutes.  It's more like 20 minutes, and then I turn the heat off and mash it all together with a potato masher.  It is heavenly!  I just finished my Thanksgiving day batch just now.  I may cheat and make a cold cut turkey sandwich just so that I can savor the warm sauce!  Tomorrow it will be served at room temperature for all to enjoy.

~ Cheers

Ever since I came across this recipe a few years ago, I have used nothing else since.  It's become a tradition to serve it.  I do add 1/2 c. walnuts.  Thanks for a really great recipe!

I've never eaten cranberry "roll" or sauce, it just seemed yucky to me, but it was requested for Thanksgiving and this recipe seemed interesting.  I loved it!  I think it was the combination of fresh cranberries and apples with all the lovely spices!  I couldn't wait to eat the leftover turkey with this and the house smelled wonderful.  I only changed a couple of things...only 1/4 cup of cider vinegar, added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and left out the raisins.  This was YUMMY!

This is really good.  I too reduced the vinegar to 2 tbsp.  I also added zest of 1 navel orange and the juice.  Excellent!

This is a good, interesting alternative to normal cranberry sauce.  It's not very sweet, if you want that you might want to increase the sugar.

Everyone absolutely RAVED about this!  It was so flavorful and the apple-cider vinegar gave it a nice twist (but I only used 1/3 cup).  I loved that it wasn't just cranberries, the other fruits gave nice textures and the apples balanced out the tartness of the cranberries.  I used whole cranberry sauce instead of fresh cranberries and it turned out fine, I just had to boil it down longer because of the extra fluid.  Will definately be making this for future Thanksgivings!

This is a wonderfully fragrant and tangy chutney.  It is especially good on a grilled turkey panini.  I reduced the sugar  by 1/4 cup, added about a tablespoon of honey and a few extra raisins which made it plenty sweet enough.

This was great @ Thanksgiving '09! If you use the vinegar you really do need to give it time to age. This recipe is reprinted here, on this site, with the same name, same ingredients, same submitter, and same description, but different reviews.

My first foray into chutney... I made this the day of, and it was awful, super vinegar flavor and pretty bitter. The second day however! WOW! My husband says he prefers this to gravy on turkey, and he LOVES gravy (he even puts it on his stuffing). It was gone before the rest of the left overs, so it was a pretty great hit! :)

I loved this. I made it to accompany Breaded Pork Tenderloin from this site. I was out of raisins, but substituted chopped, dried apricots and loved the result. Thanks for a new keeper!

Easy recipe. It got a lot of compliments at our office Thanksgiving pot luck, I thought the flavor of cider vinegar and allspice was too strong though.

I gave this recipe 5 starts because everyone else at the table like it.  I used golden raisins instead of the traditional ones.  I enjoyed it very much, however, next time, I will incorporate celery, onions, and vinegar.

I liked this recipe well enough, but my family did not. I added walnuts, but my son did not appreciate the crunchiness of those.  I only added 1/4 cup vinegar but still found that taste overwhelmed the chutney.

This is a huge hit, but we find it is better with the vinegar cut in half.

This is a great recipe.  I used blood orange juice instead of water, added walnuts, used less sugar, and let it sit for a while after cooking for 20 minutes instead of ten. Ate the entire recipe, too. Be sure to add the apple cider vinegar.  It may seem counter-intuitive, but it makes the dish.

excellent cranberry chutney. went with less sugar, about 1/4 cup, so it was quite tart, the way we like it.

This is the first time Ive ever made chutney.. it was sooo easy! I was looking for a chutney recipe to use with our brie at our family xmas dinner.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion of cutting back on the cidar vinegar to 1/4 cup and adding 2 tbsp brown sugar.  With a little chopped almonds on top..and heated up.. its to die for!!! Thanks for such a great and easy recipe.

It's the only cranberry topping I've ever been able to enjoy. I wouldn't go a Thanksgiving without after having made it for a few years in a row, and it always gets rave reviews.

This recipe is incredible. I made it after a horrible cranberry sauce recipe from the food channel. It is so good that you can use the leftovers to top your ice cream!!

I personally did not like the flavor of the spices with the cranberries, apples and raisins.  I think I would have actually like the mixture without the cinnamon, ginger, allspice and cloves.  Sorry.
