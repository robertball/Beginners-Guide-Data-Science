Really good, quick recipe! I didn't have onions in the house but substituted some chopped green onions and that worked well. Also, I used cherry tomatoes cut in half rather than a regular tomato. Lastly, I squeezed lemon juice over the entire salad at the end rather than just place lemon slices on it. Amazing and I will make again. As a note, I loved the cider vinegar as an ingredient in this recipe!

This was a wonderful dish that I've already made a couple times last week.  The only change I made was the second time I made it.  I found yellow onions too overpowering so the second time I used green onions.  It had a much nicer flavor and added a nice bit of color.  I also added diced red bell pepper and it was delicious!

I really liked this recipe, though I agree with some of the other reviews that the onion was a little overpowering, so next time I will use green onion instead.  I also added celery, which was nice.

this is my first time making a chickpea salad and now i'll definitely be making more. it was so simple and it came out delicious.  I made some adjustments to mine: i used cilantro instead of onions (didn't have any) and added a pinch more cider vinegar (i like it a little more sour)~i can't wait to share this with my bf!

Little too much onion for me, even though I am an avid onion lover.  I didn't have vinegar or oil on me, which might have overall altered the potential flavor of the salad.  With my alterations, this salad was just okay.

Fast, easy, cheap and delicious!  I admit I had my doubts. With so few ingredients, but it was GREAT!!  I couldn't find my cider vinegar so I used tarragon vinegar.  I'm sure even white would work.  I also didn't have any lemon to garnish it so i used parsley which also gave it another degree of color.  This is going to be a staple recipe for me!!

Quick, easy, yummy recipe. I needed a one-bowl dinner for myself one humid summer evening and this fit the bill perfectly.

I added chopped red pepper and snowpeas for extra crunch, plus crumbled in a bit of goat cheese. I think I'll try shallots instead of onion next time for a more subtle oniony flavour.

Thanks for this!

this is a great base salad.its almost something like my mother in law (from yemen) makes.the onion is kind of overpowering and its sort of missing something. next time im going to try adding some avacados and maybe some red bellpepper and instead of chopped onion im going to grate a small amount of onion and used lemon juice instead of lemon slices and a little more salt

quick and easy recipe. following the advice of others, i cut down the amount of onions by about half and i think it was definitely an improvement. i also added a little but of fresh cilantro [for color] and a little bit of feta on top [instead of salt]. will definitely make this again!

Tasty, healthy and refreshing.  Left out the onion and used lemon juice in place of the sliced lemons.

I loved this recipe. I would not change a thing. I did not think the onions were over powering. Instead of drizzling the salad with cider vinegar, I squeezed lemon juice. I will make this dish again. It would be a perfect salad to bring to a picnic or BBQ.

This turned out really well. The only thing I did different was leave out the onion and I added lemon juice instead of sliced lemon.

Very tasty. The texture was foreign to my group, but it wasn't a show stopper for me - I'd make and enjoy it many times.

I added cilantro leaves to make it taste even better. I added more lemon juice to even out the garlicky taste. Great, very easy to make, and delicious. I made it last night, so I let it soak overnight, so it tasted awesome for lunch at work. Thanks!

I really liked this salad, but then I just love chickpeas (or garbanzo beans).  I used 3 cloves of garlic run through a press and more vinegar than called for.  I added one chopped red pepper and used green onions and LOTS of black pepper.  I took this to work and had it for lunch two days in a row.  Very good recipe.  Thanks, Preetygill.

I tried this, being skeptical about the flavors.  I cut the recipe down to enough for 2 bites, just in case.  Wow! I absolutely LOVED it!! I love the cider vinegar kick! I will make it again tomorrow for lunch.  Thanks!

Loved this salad, warming the garlic is a great idea, I love garlic so used a very large clove.  Salad was satisfying and tasty, quick to put together too.  This is a keeper.
