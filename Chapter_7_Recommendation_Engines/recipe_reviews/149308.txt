Made a few changes.. try using fresh corn and then scrape off the kernels with a knife instead of cream corn ( added a dollop of cream) .. two ears of corn is enough, just boil in water about 10 min. Also saute the onions, garlic, and squash with butter. Do this until the onions caramelize, I also used flour, corn meal(4:1), baking powder and salt mixture, instead of a baking mix. Mixed two cheeses cheddar and Parmesan with cheddar on top.  
No left overs.

This is a pretty good recipe! Very yummy! The only comment I have for it is that I wish I had used even more veggies. The mix takes up more space than anticipated and makes for uneven bites. Some are nice and vegetabley, while others are all strange batter-fluff.

Light, flavorful, great fall side-dish recipe!  I went 50-50 yellow squash and zucchini to add some color, but otherwise followed recipe exactly.  It might just be my oven, but it needed at least 10 min. more time than recipe suggested.  Thanks for a keeper!!

Super easy and delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly (except my dish was an 8x8) and had no problems.  It was a big hit at Thanksgiving.  Next time I'll try adding some zucchini too.

I made this with fresh organic yellow squash from our garden.  Used one teaspoon of Splenda "Sugar Blend for Baking" and 15 ounces of cream corn.
Both my wife and I thought it was delicious.

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving. I was looking for something that combined something different with summer squash which i'm crazy about.I subbed 1/4c.cheddar cheese instead of parmesan(my husband doesn't care for it)and,i used fluffy pancake mix 1/2c. in place of the bicuit mix i don't normally use mixes.It came out very tasty my whole family enjoyed it!I think next time i'll add a little milk or cream to help with preventing drying out.

Very good! I was rummaging through my cabinets 2 days before Christmas for ingredients to make something to take to our family's holiday gathering. I found this recipe and had everything to make it. It sounded a little too "yellow" to me, so I added parsley and some red and green pepper for color. Beautiful and very tasty! I did find it took about 45 minutes to bake though. I'll definitely be making it again, my husband and son loved it!

It was ok but I thought for me to much filler and not enough squash I would add more squash.

So good...I cut down on the sugar a little bit since people said it was sweet.  I also had problems with it taking a while, I finally took it out of the oven after 1 hour, and the onions were still kind of hard.  I also added crushed ritz crackers and cheese on the top.  I thought it was great...my husband didnt like it so much because of the squash and onions being crunchy still.

Casserole was slightly sweet, however all the kids loved this one!  My nephews are hard to please and they asked for seconds.  I will make this again, especially in summer when I get overrun with squash and zucchini.

Great recipe! I was looking for a way to use the abundance of yellow jarred squash I have from my mom's garden. I was a little worried that using the canned squash might make the dish too mushy but it turned out fantastic. I used about 3 1/2 cups of the canned squash instead of 2 cups and I used minced, dried onions since I had just used my last onion in another recipe. 

As far as cook time, I baked the dish for 40 minutes and then cut the oven off but kept it closed inside for another 30 minutes or so while the rest of dinner finished cooking. It turned out perfect; I may actually have to remember to try and do that next time. 

Also, I did not use a 9x9 dish since it was not available. I used a round, 2 qt glass dish and it worked like a charm.

made this last night with a few minor changes. I added a bit more squash (about 1/2 -3/4 cup) I used 1 pk of splenda (to use the sweetness was perfect, anything more would have been too sweet) I used homemade baking mix (from this site) and I was out of parm so I just put a handfull of shredded chz ( i had colby jack and sprinkled more chz on top after baking.)  It did take awhile to cook, it was around 55mins before i decided to take it out. It was very mushy (i'm not sure what the texture is suppose to be) but the flavor was amazing. Once it cooled it set up alot better. My bf and i really liked this dish. I'll make it again for sure.

The dish was good and easy to make.  Eliminate the sugar....the creamed corn has enough sweetness.

This was tasty....I used reviewers tips to saute onions, squash & garlic a little to avoid raw"er" tasting veggies and I think it really helped the dish.  Didn't have creamed corn so I used regular corn with juice from the can and added a huge dollop of sour cream to kinda compensate.  It was a little dry still...I'd love to find a squash casserole like Boston Market's  :o)  The search continues but I may make this again if similar options are in play.  Thanks!

We loved it!  I used the basic recipe and changed it to my taste and what was on hand.  I am so glad I tried it.  We exchanged the parm for mont jack/cheddar blend as that was all I had, and used zucchini and yellow squash since I had both that I needed to use up.  It was SOOOOOO yummy...try it!

Followed recipe exactly and it came out wonderful.  Thanks so much!  Think that next time I will add black beans to give it some protein and make it a complete meal.

This was wonderful! My husband and I proceeded with caution since we've never combined squash and corn in the same dish, but we were delighted. I used pancake mix but will use bisquick next time for a thicker texture.

This is a great last minute side dish, and it's incredibly versatile. I've replaced the squash with broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, fresh green beans, etc... Change the cheeses for more variety. Add fresh parsley or chives.... Lots of options! Great base for whatever veggies are in the fridge.

I followed the recipe, but I also added 1 can drained whole kernel corn along with the creamed corn. I really like corn. This was delicious.  I like the sweetness and the creamy texture that resulted. I baked it for 40 minutes. The Vidalia onions and the edges of the squash were still slightly crunchy. I would definitely make it again.

I increased the recipe by 50% because of the size of can of creamed corn and the fact I had a large squash - over 3 cups.  Per other reviewers, I sautéed the onions - maybe tripling amount - and also sautéed squash though I am not sure it was necessary.  I also cut squash into 1 inch cubes rather than slicing.  For the mix, I ended up using a mistake I made earlier in the week when I mixed a pie crust box and a cornbread box.  Who knew it would turn out so well!  It did take about 1 hr to cook, but this is probably dependent on size of pan.  It is my favorite squash casserole recipe!

My casserole did not come out creamy and yummy, it was very dry and just "okay".  It could possibly be that I live at 4,300 ft. sea level, too. If anyone has any ideas...the squash was not quite done and I was thinking maybe some diced green chilis.

A great, easy recipe that was a perfect use of the squash threatening to take over our counter.  We ate it as a main dish and really enjoyed it with a salad and bread on the side.  We'll definitely be enjoying it again this summer!

This was a pretty fantastic dish, the only solid problem i had with it was the color.  it wasnt very visually appealing, and im probably just being nit picky about this, but I really appreciate it when food looks and tastes delicious.

I made this for Christmas dinner and it was a big hit. The only change I made was using frozen squash that I cut into quarters. It is so easy and delicious that it's a regular at our house now. Thanks for the recipe.

I usually make a different summer squash casserole (from this website), which my family LOVES! I tried this one....doubled the recipe and used 1 can of creamed corn, 11 ounces of frozen corn and HALF the sugar, and Heartsmart bisquik. It came out great!  We all thought it was a very nice alternative to our favorite recipe.

Be sure to use the small size can of corn or it won't set properly. Once I made it correctly, I knew this was the corn casserole I was looking for. So yummy, I couldn't stop picking at the pan. Instead of using Bisquick, I make my own whole wheat baking mix from the More with Less Cookbook.

Fantastic recipe!  A definite keeper.  Only changes I made were to add another small squash, about a cup of leftover whole kernel corn, a dash of parsley for color and used 1/8 cup shredded cheddar and 1/8 cup Parmesan.   Can you imagine the best scalloped corn you ever ate?   This is it but the squash adds texture and taste.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  Everyone loved it but the three year old granddaughter.  Her loss! ??

Very good.  My changes were to reduce the sugar (eyeballed about a tablespoon), eliminate the parm, used two garlic cloves, one small onion, and two yellow squash.  Sauteed onion, squash, and garlic first.  Added about 1/3 cup cheddar to the casserole and topped with about 1/4 cup.  Also used pancake mix rather than baking mix as it was what I had and didn't feel like mixing up from scratch.  Very tasty!

This is a wonderful recipe and I am so glad I tried it.  I made a few changes to suit my family.  Took out the Parmesan cheese (my guys don't like it).  Added a can of whole kernel corn, a half a cup of chopped green peppers, and a half of cup of red peppers.  The second time I made it I forgot the sugar and it tasted just fine, so I probably will leave it out from now on.  This is a pretty dish and very tasty!

This is the best squash casserole I have ever eaten! 
I used about 2 tsp. sugar and fresh corn cut off the cob because that is just what I had here (I live in the country) and I had lots of squash. Going to pass this on to all my friends.

This dish had a really good flavor and was a nice way ti "dress up" yellow squash.  It took slightly longer to cook than the recipe called for (48-50 min), buit it was worth the wait.  I served it as a side dish for grilled BBQ chicken and it hit the spot.  Thanks for sharing.

A great way to use up all that yellow squash in the garden. I used 3 cups of squash instead of 2 and a little less sugar. It took about 45 minutes in the oven and I increased the temperature to 400 for the last 10 minutes. Next time will add some shredded cheddar cheese.

This was pretty good. Even though I cut the sugar in half it was still slightly sweet, but eveyone loved it and the children went for seconds. I added some fresh veggies from our garden such as corn and green beans. If you want to make this a main course just add some cooked chicken.

I have never been big on squash,but this year we planted squash. I was looking for squash recipes and figured I would try this one. This one is excellent!!! There is only two of us but there was not very many leftovers.

This was very tasty. Since I was trying to use up squash that was already cut, I left it cubed and it added a little crunch! It was a little sweet, but the cheese made up for it. I think it needed a little salt.

I thought this recipe was okay, but I don't think I will make it again.  A major problem I had was the sweetness.  It was edible, but the leftovers barely got touched.

I would chop the yellow squash next time I make this so it blends better with the corn.

I LOVE this dish!  It is so easy and delicious.  I just made it for thanksgiving and the family loved it too.  I also recommend baking it a little bit longer and also adding some cornflakes on top for some  crunch.

when I initially shared this recipe I used garlic salt, but the same amount of minced garlic works fine too.  I make my own biscuit mix from another recipe on this site and it turns out great!

Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this casserole for my family tonight exactly as specified in the recipe and it turned out delicious.  There wasn't a single bite leftover.  Everyone raved about how delicious it was. I'll definitely be making this again.

I liked the recipe because of its simplicity.  Most have added cheese.  However, I may add a can of creamed corn to my next batch.

I liked it. I added more squash I doubled the recipe.  I did 6 cups of squash. Added 1 cup of shredded cheese and milk and cooked for an hour.  Plus seasoned with Adobo. I was skeptical about it but it turned out great....

Amazing! The only thing I really did differently was after it was done cooking I added a little bit of that shredded Parmesan cheese on top and stuck it under the broiler for a few minutes to give it a nice crisp crust on top and it was delicious!

This recipe has a lot of potential. It was a little bland. Next time I might add some cheddar, more garlic, some salt.

After reading reviews, I decided to make some changes. First, I used a 14.5 oz can of creamed corn. I've never seen an 11 oz can of corn. I used one small yellow squash and one small zucchini, which equaled two cups. I sliced them thinly.  I only used one TBSP  sugar, as I knew two would be too sweet. I added 1/ 2 cup onion, and 1/4 c. Parmesan as well as 1/4 c. Cheddar cheese. As I was using a 7x5x2 glass pan, I figured I'd have to cook it a little longer. I ended up cooking it for 50 minutes, just to get the middle cooked. It had a  good flavor, but was a lot more moist than other corn and squash casseroles. I'm not sure I really like it so moist. I might make it again, as I am testing different corn  and/or squash casseroles.

Following some of the advice in other reviews, I sauteed the squash and onions in a little olive oil.  Because I had them and thought some color would be nice, I added a banana pepper that had turned red and a red Serrano pepper.  After taking the pan off the heat, I added the fresh garlic.  I always use a lot more garlic than is in recipes because I like it.  I didn't have an 11 oz can of creamed corn, so I used the standard size.  Mixed that into egg whites.  I cut back on the sugar, which turned out to be a good choice.  And, substituted cheddar for the Parmesan cheese.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable.  At the last minute, I decided to add some cherry tomatoes from my garden. 

The cooking time of 30 minutes worked perfectly even being at 3500 ft.  I was rather surprised by that based on other reviews.  Anyway, it was not jiggly and the tester came out clean.  I turned off the heat and left it in another five minutes.

I gave it a taste and was amazed at how good it was.  I started with a little scoop and went back for a bigger scoop a few minutes later.   :)  I think my picky eaters will enjoy this as much as I did.  And, I have another use for my squash, tomatoes, and peppers.  I thought I was going to add some basi

This is very easy to put together if you have the key ingredients.  I had yellow squash that I wanted to use in a different way but had no corn at all.  However we had corn leftover from Boston Market earlier in the day so I used that and added about 1/3 cup of heavy cream I had.

Great recipe! Reminded me of my grandmother's corn pudding with the squash addition...so good. I sprinkled some cayenne pepper in for a little kick. Have made it several times this summer...lots of houseguests here who cleaned their plates! It has been added to my "do again" recipes!

Not sure if I did something wrong (I followed the recipe), but it tasted too "eggy."  Also, it was browned, but didn't seem to be cooked through after 40 minutes.

Had an over abundance of yellow squash this year.  Saw your recipe(and made it as written) and tried it out.  VERY good. I love finding new ways to cook with veggies.  Thanks for posting it.

Wonderful with a few changes.  I added about twice the amount of garlic and used 3 cups of squash rather than the 2 suggested.  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and sauteed the onion, squash, and garlic in a little butter prior to mixing it into the butter/egg mixture.  For more spice, I also added some cayenne pepper.
