It is a little work to make the masala but it is worth it.  I added orange juice to it and made it with salmon instead of chicken.  Great tangy/spicy taste and flavor!!

This recipe was very time-intensive and expensive, considering the exotic spices and mortar & pestle that I had to buy.  Nonetheless, I think it was definitely worth it.  The fresh-ground spices resulted in a huge burst of flavor.  I served the mixture in  parathas (bought frozen from the Indian grocery).  It would also be great over rice.  Any suggestions as to how to make without the tamarind pulp?  I am moving soon and it might be hard to find - it's also kind of annoying because it is only sold in big packages and I don't use it for anything else.

This recipe went over well with my family, it was nice to have a sandwich with a little zip to it.

@ AIMEEWOZ - I've substituted an equal amount of tomato paste for tamarind pulp with success. It's not the same, but it should do.

I did not care for this recipe. There are to many spices and flavors going on... I thought it would have taste like the one I have tried on my trip to the caribbean.. completely different!!!
