Yummy. A tasty summer dish - hot or cold.  I modified the dish slightly, but it turned out well.

I used more corn (2 cups) and threw in an entire 19 oz can of black beans. I also used fresh instead of dried basil (1/2 cup).  Instead of parmesan, I used feta with pleasing results.  I also used way less oil (only 1 tbsp).  Otherwise pretty tasty.. I'd wait for the summer tomatoes for this dish. :)

Wow!! Kids raved and hubby loved it!  I was out of green onions, so I added 1/4 tsp dried minced onion.  Used rotini for the pasta, and of course added a little garlic powder cause everything's better with garlic! Thanks for the great, quick recipe.

Really fast and tasty.  My husband thinks to make it a 5 star recipe it should have bacon (and really EVERYTHING is improved with bacon).

This was very enjoyable and fresh-tasting.  I used white corn off the cob, fresh garden tomatoes, balsamic vinegar and whole wheat thin spaghetti.  We had this for dinner tonight with Savory Garlic Marinated Steaks, corn on the cob, Pineapple Lemonade Spritzers and Grilled Peaches and Cream.  It was a sensational dinner, and the best I've had in a long time!

I have been looking for a recipe like this for a long time.  We have go to a resturant that has corn and tomato linguini and I wanted to make it at home.  This fits the bill perfectly.  I left out the scallions (personal taste) - I will make this often !!

I enjoyed this recipe - very easy, refreshing dish for a summer evening.  I added a little more corn and fresh basil.  My husband liked it too.  It woould be great with grilled chicken added, too.

I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars!  I used fresh corn off the cob, and halved cherry tomatoes, and substituted feta cheese instead of Parmesan (thanks to another reviewer).  For some protein and to make this dish a complete meal, I added in some smoked turkey sausage!  It was a big hit!

Orzo was a good pasta choice.  Tasted the mixture hot last night and did not like it at all - way too vinegary.  Had it cold today for lunch - delicious.

Very good.  I used balsamic because of reviewers suggestions, but next time I will use red wine (balsamic is too strong and sweet).  I used bow-tie pasta, and it was very eye-catching.

I have made this 3 times in 2 weeks. Used corn off the cob. Add red pepper flakes and garlic powder to the "sauce". So good for lunch the next day. I used whole wheat rotini for the pasta. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe!  I made this with balsamic like many other reviewers and added a bunch more fresh parmesan.
Because it's November now and not the middle of the summer, I actually threw the pasta and sauce mixture back on medium heat for about 5 minutes.  Warming the tomatoes and corn through really helped the flavour of the dish.  It also allowed the pasta to absorb the flavours a little more.
Will definitely make again!

While this is certainly at its best with fresh veggies, it is also great with canned tomatoes and corn, when fresh isn't available.

This is a simple and healthy dish with great flavor! I used white wine vinegar and it was very good. I  also added some garlic powder and minced onion because I didn't have any scallions. You can't beat the fresh tomatoes, corn and basil with real parmesan cheese.

I was going to give 3 stars, but then I got some of the green onions and was happier.  I took the corn from the cob, using the nifty Corn Zipper from Williams Sonoma. Works great but watch out! I sliced several layers off my thumb when I was pulling the blade cover off.  VERY sharp. I didn't expect that

This was awesome! I didn't add the scallions as I don't like them (and forgot the salt and pepper). And it was still great! I did add some leftover beans (black and kidney) from another dinner - heated them up and they were a great addition to the dish! Thanks so much! Hubby said he would love to have this dish again!

I love this recipe!  It's nutritious and full of summer flavor.  I was afraid that it would be too bland, but the spices were just right.  I used balsamic vinegar, fresh corn cut off the cob, and part fresh basil and part dried.  My only complaint is that it was a little dry the second day, so don't make it too far in advance.

I think this recipe originally appeared in Gourmet magazine, and for good reason. It's just delicious. So nice for summer, with fresh tomatoes and corn in abundance. Personally, i think the recipe as written makes too much of the "dressing" and leaves the vegetable and pasta mixture a bit oily. Next time, I might try adding some cooked cannellini beans to the mix, to get some protein in there. This one's a keeper.

This is WONDERFUL!  I make it at least once a week in the summertime.  It makes a great side dish to any grilled meat, but it also makes an even better main dish with the addition of sauteed/grilled shrimp, scallops (bay or sea) or chicken tenderloins.  YUM!!!

We grew all the vegetables in our garden. My husband loved it. I didn't have any red wine vinegar so I used a red wine vinegar and oil bottled salad dressing instead. Made a great lite lunch with a lettuce salad. With the leftovers I added Ranch Dressing and refrigerated it for pasta salad. A keeper.

It's the easiest way to prepare a nutritious and healthy pasta I've ever seen. The red wine vinegar gives it the great taste is has. 100% recommended.

Great summer recipe. Nuked fresh corn off the cob for just a minute, added marjoram, and used bowtie pasta. Don't understand calling for dried herbs, though, when giving a recipe for fresh tomatoes and corn. The parmesan was good, but it really wasn't even needed. The fresh tomatoes and corn really shine in this quick summer feast.

I make a similar dish based on an offering at a local restaurant.  Use only fresh basil, use white wine rather than vinegar and add some of the tiny capers.

We like trying new things but this dish confirmed, for our tastes anyway, that vinegar does not belong on pasta.  Without it I know this would have been very good.

This is really nice!  I like it cold and didn't measure exactly, the ingredients are stellar, though!  I used Barilla whole grain angel hair pasta, grilled corn on the cob, cherry tomatoes and fresh basil from my garden.  I wouldn't have thought of putting these things together.  Nice Recipe!!! Thank you!  Will make often!

Great recipe.  I normally am not a big fan of basil, but it goes great in this dish. I agree with another reviewer about adding feta cheese instead of Parmesan.

I liked this!  We changed a lot, though, just because it sounded good.  I used Potato Gnocchi for the pasta, and added Cannellini beans to the mix.  We added more vinegar the next day and ate it cold as a salad.  It was very good.  I also omitted the green onions because I didn't have any, but I think it would have been better with them. Thanks for the recipe!

Smelled really great, I made this for my brother, but he is a bit of a picky eater so I can't really give this a true rating. I substituted the green onions, with regular vidalia onions and the red wine with balsamic. Overall pretty decent and very easy!

Other than substituting Italian seasoning (for basil),we followed the recipe as written.  We used angel hair pasta which worked really well w/ the corn & tomatoes.  Very good summer time entrée.

This was a very refreshing and satisfying summer dish. I chose orzo as my pasta and used red cherry, roma, and yellow pear tomatoes, and fresh basil--all from my garden, which made it taste even better! I subbed balsamic vinegar per the suggestion of other reviewers. Delicious--I will definitely make again!

Awesome summer recipe. Highly recommend with the fresh basil. I didn't have scallions/green onions so I just used a yellow onion. It was still fantastic.

LOVED IT!  I made as the recipe stated except I used fresh basil and one clove of garlic.
What I really loved about it was how easy it was.  I am the only one in the family that likes veges, so after cooking the pasta I pulled some for me and added the mixture.  I served the rest of the pasta with boring sauce for everyone else.  Again...LOVED IT!

I took this dish to a small dinner party as a side. I added more than 1 TBSP of Parmesan cheese and the basil was fresh. Also added a clove of garlic. This dish is great to use up all those tomatoes that you get in the fall. Everybody loved it.

Excellent! I used 1 cup of C&W Ultimate Southwest Blend (corn, black beans, onion, peppers), prepared in microwave. This in place of the 1/2 cup corn. Trader Joe's pasta seasoning blend (contains basil), in place of dried basil. 5 small firm tomatoes, cut up. The amount of each main ingredient is not crucial. With the corn, black beans, bits of pepper, along with the tomatoes, then the added basil leaves, this pasta dish is festive and colorful.

I made this without the vinegar and substituted green beans for the onions.  The family agreed it was better served hot, and it was a real winner then.

Fresh, light, and very summery.  I used the ingredients, but added the specific amounts to taste.  I also added a tiny bit of onion powder and a splash of lime juice and raspberry champagne vinegar for more brightness and a fruity zest.  The corn was a very nice addition for textural complexity and taste. I did use thin spaghetti as my pasta choice. Great recipe that allows flexibility to make it just how you like it!

This is very flavorful and a snap to make. I used the rest of a box of orzo (approx 8-10 oz), two cobs of sweet corn (uncooked), and cherry tomatoes cut in half. The raw corn gave the dish a great texture. Adding the scallions, basil and Parmesan cheese put this over the top. My family devoured this before I could take a pic. Delicious, and I will definitely make again!

Just served this dish for dinner.  It was super easy and it can be modified to what you have in the kitchen.
I used kalmata olives and sprinkled parsley on top.  Will keep this recipe.

This was great!  Super easy and a great summer meal.  I followed the recipe, but added some grilled chicken for some protein.  I'll definitely make this again.

Great recipe, simple and flavourfull.  I use balsamic vinegar rather than the red wine vinegar.  I find it complements the tomatoes and basil more.

This was somewhat of a disappointment to me.  After chopping up 2 tomatoes, of the 4 the recipe called for, I felt that was more then enough.  And it was.  Although there were a lot of flavors in this dish, the amount of tomatoes, even with just 2, was somewhat over powering.  All in all, not a bad dish, but not, in my opion, worthy of more then 3 stars.  Thanks anyway.

Amazing!  I was absolutely astounded that this had so much flavor.  I will be making this again--it's a great way to clean out the two ingredients I usually have lots of.  Thank you!

This makes a great light meal or side dish. Fresh basil makes a big difference, and I think if I used fresh corn, it would be better.

This was very good! I followed the recipe exactly (except I left out the fresh basil) and it had a great combination of flavors. It was also very easy to prepare. I'll definitely be making it again. Thanks!

I found this recipe to be a bit tasteless. Needs more seasoning and maybe some shrimp next time. I used all fresh ingredients (tomatoes, corn and basil) from my garden. This made it a very refreshing summer entree.

Used red onion & balsamic vinegar because that was what I had.
Very good, even my hubby loved it & he is a picky eater & usually doesn’t compliment.
Definitely will make again

My husband and I loved this pasta salad - it was fresh and delicious, one of the best pasta salads I have had.  I followed the recipe fairly closely. I used canned corn and used the whole can instead of 1/2 a cup.  My husband likes a lot of dressing so I added 2 T of olive oil and 2 T of red wine vinegar to the amount stated in the recipe and I also added cooked shrimp since we are not vegetarians and he likes meat. Cooked, diced chicken would be another option next time.  It was a wonderful salad and I will definitely make it again. Thank you so much for a great recipe.

I made this recipe as written.  It was delicious!  I ate 2 servings, and I don't even care for pasta that much.  I think I will add a full cup of corn next time because my husband loves corn.  Also I don't think the 1 tablespoon of  Parmesan cheese added much to the recipe.  I will leave that out next time.

I used the tomatoes out of the garden and some corn off the cob.  The basil was fresh, too.  I did not use scallions, instead I diced up a small yellow onion.  But I used real grated parmesan, not that sawdust that Kraft sells.  I also used some small pasta shells left over from a minestrone recipe.  It all blends together so well.  Sweet, salty, fresh.  a really light and yummy salad to go with my grilled baby back ribs!

This was really good and would definitely make again. I added some mozzarella (little) balls, halved, to add some more protein as I served as a light dinner. Would also be good served chilled.

I liked this dish. I made a few tweaks. I used a whole year of corn, minced a clove of garlic. Sweated half of the garlic before adding corn and 8 oz. of medium shrimp cut into 1 inch pieces which I sauteed until the shrimp was done. I placed the green onions, remaining garlic and fresh garden tomatoes (seasoned with Penzeys sandwich sprinkle) in the bowl first. Added salt and pepper to taste and stirred to combine, then I added the vinaigrette and let it sit for 5 min. before adding the hot medium size shells. Mixed, poured into a serving bowl and topped with parmesan and 2 tbsp of julienned fresh basil. Yum.

I used cherry tomatoes, 2 ears of corn, could have used a third, and tri-colored rotinni. Also fresh basil, and cooked cremini mushrooms,  because I had them on hand. Great flavor, will make again.

I used the garden rotini pasta and canned corn, missed seeing the green onions on recipe so I didn't have those but over all it was good.  We had it cold so it was a nice summery type meal.  Wish i would have gotten the fresh basil to add a little more flavor.

This recipe is delicious! I cut the olive oil to 3 tablespoons and increased the corn and tomatoes.  Tasty both hot and cold. Next time I’ll add olives and maybe try with feta cheese.  Fun to experiment but a really good summer recipe  as is!

This was delicious!  I used balsamic vinegar and finely chopped shallots. I used corn that I steamed on the cob and then cut off and baby heirloom tomatoes. I used both the dried and fresh basil and Parmesan cheese.    It was fresh and flavorful- a wonderful light   summer pasta salad.

An easy summertime recipe that's delicious and looks so pretty! I halved red, yellow and purple cherry tomatoes and used bow tie pasta for added eye appeal.Added some sliced grilled chicken to leftovers the next day and served slightly warmed to bring out flavors. So good!! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

This was light and tasty.  Used up some linguini, but would try it with orzo next time.  Added a clove of garlic.

I made this and found it to be very tasty. I did make a few changes; cut back on the vinegar and oil by a tblsp, used feta cheese instead of parm and added some garlic powder. It still could of used something else for flavor but not sure what. Maybe fresh garlic would be better.  I still enjoyed it and would definitely make it again.

Summer Veggie Spaghetti! No hard food science here- just a red wine vinaigrette with a little anchovy paste (secret ingredient!), fresh garden tomatoes, fresh Anaheim chilis, fresh butter corn, fresh garden scallions, fresh garden basil, some chopped olives and a handful of artichoke hearts all tossed with pasta of your choice! Delicious.

I use Olive Garden salad dressing, not bland at all!  If you make your own, don't forget to use salt and pepper, also not bland.

what's not to like about this recipe? Although I hate when people change the recipe and then review it, here goes...I used half red wine vinegar and half balsamic...I also added diced avocado for color and threw in part of a can of kidney beans I had open..This was a great summer salad!

I enjoyed this dish.  I added chicken and sausage.  I couldn't find fresh corn so I used frozen, tasted great.  I skipped the dried basil and used fresh (about 1/4 cup).  I added garlic salt and red pepper flakes as other reviewers suggested, I didn't add enough because it was still slightly bland.  Next time I will add fresh garlic.  I also heated everything together at the end in the pan.

Flavored are fantastic! I just think there is too much pasta for the amount of veggies. I'd do 4 oz instead of 8oz next time. This would pair very nicely to some grilled chicken with Italian herbs, or Italian sausage. Maybe even some turkey meatballs. Nonetheless very yummy!

This was really good and a great way to use some of the tomatoes from my garden.  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding a chopped jalapeno, a chopped avocado,  a chopped green pepper, and six vegetarian sausage links that I fried in olive oil and cut into tiny slices.

Looking at the other reviews and ingredient  list I thought this would be a very bland dish. However, it turned out really nice. I did add some fresh spinach which cut down on the sharpest of the red wine vinegar. Also, I served it cold. Very good!

I made this for covered dish party, so I made the whole box of pasta, added an entire pint of yellow and red cherry toms and added mint instead of basil. I also used EVVO and lemon zest, plus the juice of a lemon. I also substituted Pink Himalayan sea salt and fresh ground black pepper in addition to the red wine vinegar. Oh, and I cut the kernels off five ears of corn.        Very Fresh and Delish!! Tastes like Summer!

This is an excellent side dish/salad. I did not have the fresh basil, but otherwise made it with the called for ingredients. I thought it had lots of flavor with the basil and parmesan. I did not have time to refrigerate it, but it was great at room temp. Can't wait to try it cold !

Just got done making this about an hour ago and can't keep DH out of it.  Waiting for it to chill before supper tonight.  We absolutely loved it, warm, room temp or chilled.  At first I thought it was a little bland but as the flavors started to blend...divine!!  I did use lots of fresh basil and a lot more corn and parmesan.  The parmesan sets it over the top.  We have been thinking about many other veggies or meats that could be used in this also.  But as it stands it is delicious.  Thanks for sharing.  7/24/16
Made it again for a picnic with friends.  The first time I used broken up thin spaghetti.  This time I used orzo pasta and I think we prefer it with this type pasta but both are very good.  BTW...2 of my friends ask for the recipe...a sure sign of a great recipe.

We both really liked this but I did make some changes.  I added quite a bit of diced garlic to the sauce as well as some additional amounts of the red wine vinegar until it tastes just right.  I also added a can of rinsed black beans.  It was very tasty and easy!  My husband said he would like to leave out the fresh basil next time.

I have never tried this recipe w/ the corn but have made some derivative of it for years.  I added the corn tonight and we absolutely devoured it....  so fresh, crunchy and delicious!  

My changes.... instead of dried basil, I used dried Italian seasoning and added some marinated artichokes that were in the fridge--drained the liquid...mostly water.  I used only  1 tablespoon of OO.   I  added a heaping tablespoon of Boscoli olive salad--a staple in our household and lots of fresh basil---much more than called for in the recipe.  I let this mixture sit and marinate for a couple of hours and then topped w/ shaved, sharp provolone cheese.  Full disclosure:  If you take anything  w/ provolone cheese  on top of it to a party, it's going to give off a very strong/pungent aroma!  :>)

No changes. Just didn't have any corn. It was excellent. Will be making this again for sure.

I whisked together the oil and red wine vinegar wth garlic salt  oregano and feta cheese! This was like a "clean out the fridge" salad... added cucumber, black olives, pepperoncini rings as well with everything else in the recipe!! Mmmmmm so much goodness!!

Love this salad.  I have made it too many times to count. 
I use a large handful of fresh chopped basil instead of dried.
And you can also add a bit more parmesan.  Don't forget the
salt and pepper to taste.  I have served with BBQ chicken and also with  cajun flavored BBQ shrimp.   Family and friends rave about this one.

This was fabulous. I was looking for a recipe to use this tiny Italian pasta in called Scuccuzzu and it works!  I didn't have red wine vinegar but used a fruit infused vinegar which made it sweeter but followed the recipe Other than that.  I am making it again for lunch tomorrow and adding cooked shrimp from last night.  Yum!

I have been making this recipe for a long time now. While it's always excellent, it's completely wonderful in the summer when I can drive down the street and get freshly-picked fresh corn from a farm which has been in the Merrick family for nearly 200 years.

It loses a bit in the off-season, but it is still delicious.

I sometimes throw in a quarter cup or so of chopped green olives- amazing!

Very versatile.  Opted to use fesh corn, zucchini, peas.  Sautéed veggies with onions then added to cooked pasta.  Lots of fresh grated cheese.  Will do again and again.  Great way to introduce veggies to kids.

Made this tonight for a supper side dish.  The whole family loved it.  I used little pasta letters and cherry tomatoes.  The flavor is light but very tasty.  Be sure to use a good brand of olive oil.
