A solid tasty dinner. You can make the steak as you like and the honey mustard dressing is excellent for this salad and a recipe that I will use in other dishes. This meet my requirement of a five star rating in that I not only will make it again, but I will make it for company and use the dressing for other dishes.

Maybe because it was the first grilling of the season but it tasted great.  I've made the dressing again for other salads.  Looked twice the canned fried onions? never found them.

I marinated my steaks using a balsamic vinigar recipe. Great recipe! Definitely saving this to make for company.

Great different use of leftover steak, different from the usual steak salad with lettuce. Dressing has a nice kick to it.

Made exactly as described.  My husband said it was restaurant quality, and I agree.  I pre-cut the veges and and made the dressing  ahead.  I served the salad with a caramelized onion and mushroom pizza topped with feta.  (before cooking the steak I caramelized one whole sweet onion sliced thin and a pound of mushrooms sliced in olive oil and butter with fresh cracked pepper and salt. I spread the caramelized mixture over a pre-made pizza crust and crumbled feta over top.  Drizzled a little extra-virgin olive oil.  Pre-heated oven to 450 and when ready to bake, turned the broiler on to Hi.  Baked in the oven while steak was resting (5 minutes).)  I cooked the steak for 4 minutes a side for medium 2 minutes at a time to get grill marks. While steak was resting and pizza was baking, assembled the salad. Sliced the meat and divided over two plates.  I should note that I halved the dressing as I didn't need 3/4 cup of the dressing for two plates.

This is a great salad with a nice balance of flavors.  It's also a great way to use leftover grilled steak!  Thanks for sharing, Dole!
