I made this recipe tonight for my parents.  There were no leftovers!  My parents and I all thought it was very good-- it would be especially good as a breakfast casserole.  By the way, I couldn't find an oven temperature listed, so I put it in at 275 for 30 minutes.  But I rate my recipes by whether or not I think I would get an immediate proposal of marriage if I served it to a date.  It was very good, but probably not worthy of a marriage proposal.

My husband loves this dish!  The first time I made it, he shared it with our neighbors and I ended up giving the recipe to our neighbors.

It's an interesting way to serve asparagus, but the hard boiled eggs kind of overpower the dish.  The white sauce could also use a little bit more of a kick to it.  The salt and pepper seems to compliment the eggs more then the asparagus.

I can hardly wait for fresh asparagus to come in Michigan to make this casserole.  Get rave comments every time I serve it.

I tried this last evening. The recipe did not state the oven temp. so I went with a 325* temp.  I didn't care for the presentation as layed out here. I found it difficult to serve as such. The flavor was great with the combined ingrediants but I will shift the recipe a bit next time. Also, I don't like a white sauce with such a high calorie/fat count so will adjust that too. All in all it really tased good. My famly really liked the flavor.

I put some kick in the sauce by adding cheese, smoke, worcheshire and terrayki.  It was still kinda bland.  I think the 9x13 dish is too large.  I only had one layer.  Might have been two with an 8x8.  This may have eliminated some of the egg getting rubbery by having the food packed tighter.  I added bacon pieced to the top because I had some leftover.  Glad I did.  Also dried onion.  Didn't really need the bread crumb bottom but needed more sauce.  Would not make again.  I'm sure I could find a better recipe.  Sorry.
