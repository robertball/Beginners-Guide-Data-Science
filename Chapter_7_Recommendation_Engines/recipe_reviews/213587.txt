I found this to be a bit too sweet, although the other people who ate it thought it was very good.  I would have used a different method for the topping, though.. mix the chocolate with cream, and it is easier to spread on top.

I made these for a group gathering and most people loved them.  The thing many liked was that, yes, they are incredibly rich, but this held them to a smaller piece with same level of sweet tooth satisfaction.  The recipe may appear complicated but they really were easy to put together.  I will make them again.

These are easy to make, and I liked the graham-walnut-chocolate base; I might use the cookie base for a cheesecake in the future. They are very sweet, so I cut them into 1-inch squares.
