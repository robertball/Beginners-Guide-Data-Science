I have to say that this is the only icing I will make from now on. I was a little skeptical because of the reviews I read, but I followed the recipe and directions to the t, and it turned out amazing. I let the flour mixture cool in the refrigerator until it was cold, and beet it in really well. I whipped it longer than I would normally because everyone said it was really grainy. Mine wasn't, and it wasn't buttery either. It was perfection!

I make decorated cakes and have made hundreds of pounds of icing but I don't really like it.  THIS I could eat the whole bowl.  The key is MIX WELL.  It is not greasy and when done correctly tastes like whipped cream.  It is not overly sweet and not grainy providing you beat the fats and the sugar for 2 - 3 minutes before adding the flour mixture.  I will never make cream cheese icing again!

It tasted like butter, not whipped cream.  It was to greasy.  Personally, I probably wouldn't make it again. (No offense)

This frosting is delicious on chocolate cake.  I added vanilla extract for extra flavor.  I also have a Kitchen Aid mixer which makes this frsoting extra light and fluffy.  I agree that this frosting is better the next day.  It will loose the "sugar granular" texture if you let it sit.  This version is also much easier than the one that I made when I was kid. Thanks for the recipe.

This has been my favorite frosting recipe since I was a child.  We always call it White Frosting, because it really is not like whipped cream.  I will make these suggestions...Always use margarine rather than butter.  I use butter in all of my recipes expect this one.  To avoid curdling you must whip the frosting for at least five minutes or it will tend to separate.  Also, my recipe calls for adding 3T flour to the milk.  Lastly, add a teaspoon of the vanilla to the milk/flour mixture.  This is really the best white frosting recipe out there!!!

This is one of my favorite frosting recipes that I originally got from a co-worker who got it from her mother.  I specifically like to use it for filling cupcakes (chocolate ones are the best!)  The first time I made it was for St. Patrick's Day cupcakes, so I substituted Bailey's for the milk to make an Irish Cream-flavored frosting.  It was yummy!  My recipe calls for 2-3 tbsps. of flour, and also 1 tsp. of vanilla extract, although you could also use almond, coconut, lemon, whatever you prefer. Lastly, I believe that those who complained about the grainy texture of the sugar and/or the "greasiness" from the butter did not *thoroughly* cream the butter, shortening & sugar together.  You have to cream it for at least 8 minutes if you're using a stand mixer, or 10 min. w/a handheld electric mixer.  Also, I don't completely cool the milk slurry before adding it to the creamed butter/sugar; if it's still a little warm (not HOT, but lukewarm), it actually helps to melt the sugar a little bit.

The only thing I liked about this recipe was the texture, besides that it was terrible. The butter and shortening make it really greasy, and the only thing you taste is butter. The end result is like eating lard on cake,yuck. Even after adding another cup of sugar to the frosting it still tasted like butter, but was then gritty. I suggest just sticking with plain whipped cream.

Ok, the author of this recipe left out the KEY for this to turn out.  It must be whipped, and whipped, and WHIPPED for quite a long time, BUT the end result is delightful.  After reading reviews...I let the sugar/short/butter whip for 10 min before even starting the milk.  The milk mixture took about 10 min(still whipping) the cooling took about 12 min(still whipping) and then I SLOWLY added the the cooled milk mixture in about 3 equal part, whipping 2-3 min. in between each.  At this point it was still a little granular and butter tasting and I was getting frustrated..added a bit more vanilla and whipped for probably 6-7 more minutes and then magically...smooth, silky, light, fluffy and crazily tasting like whipped whipping cream.  You just have to beat into submission,lol...worth it though.  As one poster mentioned...I did use 3 T of flour instead of 2 and I also added 1 t of vanilla during cooking milk...and probably 1/2 t at final whipping stage.  Hope this helps someone else : )

I've been looking for a whipped frosting forever.  I tried this one and all I could taste was the butter.  Too greasy.  Won't make it again.

I added only half the butter that the recipe called for and the frosting didn't taste too buttery. However, I found the flour-taste to be overpowering. The texture was good, but I was disappointed with the overall taste.

There is a commercial variety of this frosting but it is not available where I live (Atlanta area). I found this recipe which is a homemade version of the commercial stuff. I use 3/4 cup of milk and 3 T flour. I use butter flavored shortening. I use 1 1/2 t vanilla or any kind of flavoring (lemon is good). I whip the butter, shortening and sugar for four minutes, add the flour mixture and whip another four minutes. It turns out perfectly every time. If I want to make it chocolate I add 4 T cocoa powder when I make the flour mixture.

I had good results with this frosting - it was pretty yummy (I don't really like frosting - but this was really nice, light and fluffy, and not too sweet, but I could taste/feel the butter/crisco texture a little) I think the key is to keep beating it - I tested it after adding the milk/flour and beating for several minutes & it was a bit greasy and grainy, I wasn't sure it was going to turn out. But, I kept it going in the stand mixer for another 5-10 minutes and it magically became smooth & light, more like whipped cream. Next time I will probably just use regular stabilized whipped cream (add a tsp of dissolved gelatin to the cream after soft peaks form) much easier and tastes more like whipped cream (because it is!) ;)

This is a very versatile frosting that can also serve as a "fluff" layer in a cake (think Twinkies or Ho-ho's). I use this with vanilla for red velvet cake and it's an awesome peppermint fluff (tint it pink or light green) for filling or frosting. Make sure the flour mixture is cool and don't be afraid to beat the heck out of it. I've never gotten grainy results.  Great recipe.

Taste is delicious....not too hard to make. The flour mixture HAS to be COOL....or it won't come out right. I only gave it 4 stars because it doesn't last very long. I make some earlier in the day and when I went to frost my cupcakes in the evening, the frosting was lumpy and looked oily. This happened two times to me. I do recommend it IF you are frosting, then eating with in a very few hours.

Very good frosting. I was looking for something that would be like the whipped frosting that bakeries sometimes put on decorated cakes. This wasn't an exact match, but it was awfully close!

I have been using this recipe for years, and absolutely love it!  The only thing I do differently is I add 1 tsp. vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp. almond extract.  it makes all the difference in the world!

I love this recipe; make sure you beat it for a very long time to work out the granulated sugar and it definitely tastes better after it rests a few hours. It is comparable to the whipped cream frosting at a local bakery known for this frosting!

I needed something light and not too sweet for a diabetic friend.  This recipe worked great and tasted exactly like whipped cream.  Thank you...I will use this recipe ONLY from now on for all my cakes!  It works great on cookies, too.

This was unanimously reviewed by friends and family as the BEST FROSTING EVER. I used icing sugar (did a little more than1 cup) , and refrigerated the flour/milk mixture before combining with everything else. It was extremely easy and came out with wonderful texture and flavor. I topped my chocolate fudge cupcakes with it. This is my new go-to frosting!

All I can say is, WOW! Granted, I did use only butter, (equal amount to shortening-a total of 1 cup butter for this recipe), because I don't keep shortening at the house. I also used 1/2 cup whipping cream and 1/2 cup 2 percent milk for the whole milk called for. I added vanilla as others suggested. It is smooth, creamy and tastes wonderful! Tomorrow morning it's going on my chocolate cupcakes, I can hardly wait!

Follow the recipe exactly. It will work. It was not a really sweet frosting. So if your like me and like sugary frostings don't use this one. I used a bit more confectioners sugar and vanill which i thinked helped. If your not a sweet tooth use this one.

The name of this recipe is misleading, tastes nothing like whipped cream, but does have a lighter texture to it than some frostings. I use a whole cup of real butter, since I never buy shortening (although if I did, I would use butter flavored shortening) and ALWAYS add a flavored extract (butter, vanilla, almond, ect). If you follow the directions correctly and REALLY beat the mixture well it won't look like curdled milk, it will be smooth and fluffy.

I was very surprised after reading some not so great reviews. I followed the recipe exactly, except added a tsp of vanilla and a packet of Jell-O vanilla pudding mix. Absolutely fabulous!

Loved the recipe! It was exactly what I was loking for. I did not find this grainy at all as some of the other reviewers did - even right away when I made it. I did whip everything for a long time in my kitchen aid mixer. The only things I added were a little vanilla and a pinch of salt.

Great frosting!  
I used powered sugar instead of regular sugar.  Make sure the cake is cool before you frost it!

This is a really good frosting the only thing you have to add that the recipe does not call for is vanilla to give it some flavor.  I personally also add butter flavor. half a tsp of each.  It makes all the difference

Loved this recipe! It was light and not too sweet...just a hint of sweetness. I did add approx. 1/2 tsp of vinalla after reading reviews.  YUUMMM! DO NOT refrigerate if planning to use...it firms up...but at room temp it was still great! We left a few cupcakes out covered overnight and the frosting kept it's texture...was worried it would soften or melt but it was fine. My duaghter couldn't resist eating the cake b/c of the frosting.  Normally she never goes bake for more...Enjoy!

Wow! This frosting turned out amazingly amazing! A couple things I would mention/change: First of all, I got better results cooking the milk and flour on med-low heat, stirring constantly and ensuring it never came to a boil. Secondly, be aware that it takes a while to cook this mixture until thick (30+ min, though maybe less if I had started over higher heat) and lastly, even though the texture was much smoother than I expected, I will use superfine sugar instead of regular granulated white sugar to reduce any remaining grittiness next time I make this frosting (and I WILL make it again!)

Fantastic icing recipe! We love it. I would have rated it 5 stars, but it is very time consuming. As other reviewers have stated you must mix the icing A LOT. We beat it for 20 min (10 before adding the milk mixture and 10 after).

I made this as a gluten free version (35% sorghum flour, 35% potato starch, 30% tapioca flour - carol fenster's sorghum blend from 1000 gluten free recipes).  I only give it three stars because I also found it a tad greasy and not really sweet enough.  What I will do next time is more butter and less shortening (maybe only 2 tbl shortening).  I also might add more sugar, or maybe some powdered in addition to the white.  What I did do right: used baker's sugar instead of regular granulated.  Beat the  out of it for 10 minutes, let it rest for 10 minutes, beat it 5 more minutes (it was still slightly granulated, but when I added the flour mixture it became perfectly smooth).  Also, I let my flour mixture get overheated and I got a big lump in the middle, but a staff mixture smoothed it out again and it didn't seem to affect the finished product (not sure if other people had similar issues, or if this was due to my special flour).  I covered the flour mixture and cooled it completely in the fridge before adding.  I loved the texture of this frosting, I was able to both spread it and pipe it easily.  I was trying to get something similar to an Italian bakery in my neighborhood, it's *just* not quite there yet!

I didn't have luck with this recipe. It just tasted too much like shortening and it appeared oily too. I ended up going to my tried and true frosting recipe.

This recipe was a home run hit!  You do have to beat it a lot...when you think you are done, keep going....and it does help to put in your thickener when it is a tad bit warm, then there is no gritty sugary taste...I also added vanilla extract, so it would have some kind of flavor, and of course some food coloring of your choice....tasted just like the cakes at the store with the whipped cream frosting.  This is a definite keeper!

I've been searching for this recipe forever! My mother used to make this icing for her strawberry short-cake.  It is the best ever, may need to tweak it  to get the texture and level of sweetness desired. It is a great complement for fruit because it is not too overpowering.

This frosting is light and fluffy and very tasty.  I followed the advice of another reviewer.  I put the milk/flour mixture in the refrigerator to cool.  This worked to perfection.  I also added a couple of drops of vanilla for extra flavor.  The texture was just like bakery whipped cream frosting...delicious!  Thanks for the excellent recipe.

This is the best recipe I have found and I always use it and receive lots of compliments. My mom passed it on to me years ago. Much better than standard buttercream recipes that overwhelm with sweetness.  When I used those, I would always find the frosting scraped off and thrown away. With this, nearly everyone so far has eaten both the cake AND the frosting. Kids may prefer sweet, but most adults are pleasantly surprised at this frosting and request the recipe.

I got this same recipe from my Aunt Marj (she called it Bakers Frosting) decades ago, and it has been my very favorite frosting recipe ever since - except I use 4T flour, and combine it with the sugar before adding the milk (from experience, whole milk works best for this) so lumps do not form. I also add 1t vanilla when beating the cooked (& cooled) part into the butter/shortening mixture. You do not want to combine the cooked mixture with the butter & shortening until you're ready to frost your cake (I learned THAT from experience too!)

I have made this frosting for years.  However, I do not add the shortening.  Misplaced the recipe and found this one.  I do add a little vanilla.  Great frosting and is best made night before.

We liked this recipe. It isn't too sweet. Don't rely on the taste right after it is made. I immediately frosted my cake and when we ate it a few hours later the flavor had improved.

My suggestion is use a kitchen aid mixer to whip it for a lot longer than you think you should. 

The end result was wonderful. I did add a tsp. of vanilla per others recommendation. The taste and texture was amazing. This is my new favorite. Thank you!

I've used this recipe for many years and until recently didn't know you were supposed to cook it! I've always just whipped all the ingredients cold and it comes out wonderful!  I just whip it until it is very creamy. My family has always loved it.

This was delicious when it was first made.  However, I had to refrigerate it for a day and when I tried to re-whip it, it separated and became a wet mess. This is fine if you are going to use it IMMEDIATELY.  If you are a cook who makes things ahead, don't bother.

I thought it was completely perfect.. to be honest I did doubt it a little but it really proved me wrong! I mixed a little longer than normal but it still tasted great

This is the best frosting I have ever made, I have finally found a frosting I can make!  I never have any luck whenever I try to make my own frosting, but this one really tasted like it came from a high quality bakery.  I followed this recipie very closely with some minor changes.  Instead of flour, I used corn starch which I prefer over flour. I also sub'd half of the milk with whipping cream - cream always makes a recipie taste better!  I also added a full tsp of pure madagascar vanilla extract as well as a full tsp of vanilla bean paste to the milk mixture after I removed it from the heat. I also used confectioner's sugar because I noticed in my first batch that the sugar wasn't dissolving well (I even used super fine baker's suger the first time), with the second batch, the confectioner's sugar was perfect.  I did go with other's advice and beat the heck out of this recipie.  Wow!  This frosting is so light and creamy, it really was amazing.  It is so versatile, it is a great base to build off of.  If it isn't sweet enough for your taste, just add more sugar, or sub some coconut milk for a tropical flair, or add lemon or any other flavoring you can think of.  I can't comment on using this frosting for piping as I don't pipe, but it did set up very firm in the fridge - almost too firm.  This recipie made enough to lightly frost a nine inch layer cake so I would probably double it in the future.

Delicious! i needed a quick recipe with ingredients i had on hand and came across this.  I added some vanilla extract for additional flavor. Would definitely make it again.
