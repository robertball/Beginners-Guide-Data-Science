Perfect!! I like to use 1/2 c. dairy and 1/2 c. coconut milk from the can and find the ratio of milk to chia seed to cocoa is dead-on perfect. I use only 1 Tablespoon of brown sugar and find for my taste that it's sweet enough. Love what the addition of instant coffee did to deepen the chocolate flavor. I didn't have chocolate covered hemp seed but I do like cocoa nibs and had them so I used them instead. Wonderful chia seed recipe. There are so many out there but this one is my favorite because the ratio of ingredient to ingredient is best and the addition of the instant coffee really does make a difference. Kinda tastes like chocolate frosting with little tiny crunchies from the chia seeds. Delicious!!

Delicious and relatively healthy! I have made this 3 or 4 times now. One time I used buttermilk and it tasted weird; don't do that.

Welllll…. ive made a super quick version of this : )  Last years when I discovered what chia seeds do when they get wet, I started throwing them into many edible liquids. My favorite 'quick-gotta run'  treat to take to lunch at the last minute is  milk, chia and heresy's chocolate syrup. I make about 8 oz of chocolate milk in a ziplock round container and add about 2 or 3 tablespoons of chia to it. ( 5 minute intervals) Mix it, let it sit, mix it,  let it sit, put lid on and shake vigorously  and put in the fridge or lunch cooler. Its great!

This recipe is amazing! Even my 9 year old son loves it! I substituted milk with vanilla soy milk, and white sugar for honey. I omitted the coffee so the kids could eat it and the hemp seeds because I just didn't have any. My family is addicted to this pudding so I'll be making double batches of this from now on!

I loved it! I replaced regular milk with vanilla almond milk and excluded the chocolate covered hemp seeds because I did not have them. It was delicious without being overly sweet.

Based on the reviews I read, I decided to try this recipe. I was very happy that I did, it is rich and chocolate-y, and very easy to make. The only change I made is using Stevia instead of sugar.  It was so good and creamy . I will definitely make it again and the only change that I will make is to double the recipe!

This is the first chia seed recipe I have made that I actually like and I'm not a big chocolate fan! I will make this again. Mine set up fine but I made sure to whisk and let it sit like the instructions stated. I also used coconut milk instead of cow.

My pudding didn’t set up like the video. That’s my only complaint. I liked the pudding. I can’t lie, I was surprised. It was like chocolate tapioca pudding.  I omitted the brown sugar and increased the white sugar to 1/3 cup.

It is unbelievably delicious! I admit that I was not expecting that  it would be that good. I made half of the recipe, so I could have a good daily portion of chia and used 3 packages of sweetener (Twin sweetener) instead of the sugar. I didn't have the hemp seeds, so I didn't use. It is really a healthy recipe to stick to!! I will make it everyday from now on. Thanks for the recipe, Chef John!

This is a unique flavor, and could be classified as healthy if there wasn’t any sugar in it. I love unique healthy things and find the strange very good so I like it. Also it is easy. So why only three stars? Because others I’ve had tast it have strongly disliked it.

I was looking for a nondairy dessert option. This did the trick! No idea how anyone can leave it in the fridge overnight? I tasted it to check it out after the second 5min wait period, and the next time I looked, it was gone! It is filling and rich and works with whatever milk you need to use. The chia reminded me of tapioca, so I didn’t mind it. Definitely need to double or triple the recipe in the future, as this is a single serving in my book!

Used skim milk and 70% dark cocoa powder and Splenda brown sugar blend with favorable results for a no cook pudding.  Well worth making again.

I used plain soy milk, but  I think a vanilla non-dairy milk would be good too.  I also topped it with Costco's frozen cherry, blueberry, and strawberry mixture.  Those fruits lend themselves well to mingling with chocolate, so it was a tasty way to increase the nutritional value of the pudding.  It doesn't  make a lot of pudding, so next time I'll double it.

Great inspiration for chia and I double the recipe whenever I make this.  I adopted LCHF  lifestyle so I used half heavy cream, half coconut milk from the carton. I also use liquid sucralose I make from pure powder (not Splenda). I like adding some coconut flavoring along with the vanilla. No coffee or hemp added (personal pref). I find if you heat your liquid on low, mix in the cocoa, sweetener, etc., then add the chia.  It becomes a 'pudding' much quicker. I like to think of this as tapioca-ish versus a smooth pudding. Thanks CJ!

I  like pudding but wasn't sure if I would like this, so I tried half of the recipe.  I will definitely make this again. It was good even without the hemp seeds on top and was a nice treat.

I have been looking for a truck with the affording recipe and this one is delicious! I love all of Chef Johns recipes!    I had all of the ingredients on hand but I used coconut milk instead of regular milk and I did not have coffee crystals but I did have cappuccino mix, so I thought why not  it's your game a little bit of coffee flavor and was very tasty. I did not have chocolate covered hemp seeds for  for the topping but I graded some very dark chocolate to sprinkle on top! It was wonderful I will definitely make it  this again!

So GOOD! Light and airy and fresh - not at all icky-sweet, like so many other types of chocolate pudding that leave your mouth coated with that weird aftertaste. This was really delicious! I think next time I'll try it with some sliced strawberries on top.

This was great! My husband said I should make some for me since he was going to eat it all! It does take a little getting used to the chia seeds. I made it with Agave instead of the sugar, and almond coconut milk to cut the carbs way down! I will make it  as the recipe states when I want a splurge.

Great recipe!! It's quick, easy, healthy & so delicious! I sustituted half the milk with milk kefir to make it pro-biotic, too.  I didn;t have the hemp seed, so i didn't use it. I loved this dish & will definitely make it again.

While I've made this with chocolate almond milk to maybe give it more chocolate  flavor, Chef John is right.  Don't expect this to  taste like a rich dark chocolate mousse.  I liked it, my wife did not.

Very rich and chocolaty.  Has a high carb count, but I budgeted for it.  Very worth it.

I poured it in to two dessert dishes.  It's so rich I was happy with half and saved half for later.  Next time I'll use 4 ramekens.

This would be delicious with a little whipped cream on top.  Walden Farm make a creamy topping if you can't do real cream.  That being said, this dish was very satisfying on its own.  Thanks, Chef John!
