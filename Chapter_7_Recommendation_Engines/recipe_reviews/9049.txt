The rest of my family gave this a five but I made a couple of changes and didn't think a five was a fair rating in light of that. I used zesty chili tomatoes rather than "rotel" because it's too hot for my six year old. I used a 14 oz bag of chips rather than a 10 oz. I didn't use cream of celery either and can't imagine what that would have tasted like. I used cream of chicken though I expect that cream of mushroom would have been good -- even better would have been nacho cheese flavored soup or condensed cheddar. Next time I make this I think I'll cook an onion in with the chicken. I think I'll add a little sour cream to the soup mix for more zip. And I think I'll replace the Velveeta with real cheese -- colby/jack blend or something similar. That processed taste wasn't my favorite though my family loved it. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was a great casserole. I baked it in the conventional oven & used shredded Mexican cheese instead of Velveeta. It did reheat well for lunch but it was best on the first day when the chips were crispiest.

Followed the recipe nothing is really "wrong" with the recipe I just didn't care for the flavor. Will not make again.

This was really good! I made some changes though... because I'm me! first I ended up using regular tomato sauce and left over tomato cream sauce. I probably doubled the tomato. I also used a 26 ounce can of cream of chicken instead of the cream of celery. This made it creamier but my dad did note that it didn't have enough texture. I like creamy so I wasn't afraid of that too much. In the end i think my family really liked it! Thanks!

This tasted better than my finished dish looked. I would definitely make it again. Moist chicken and great authentic flavor. Thank you!

I made this as written except I used tortilla strips instead of chips. Pretty good as is but it needs seasoning (chili powder etc.).

Not a fan of spicy so I used regular diced tomatoes and cream of chicken soup. I also added taco seasoning for a little kick. I didn't layer the chips and used them to dip instead and used regular mexican shredded cheese. Didn't use it but cilantro could be sprinkled on top when done. Be generous with the soup mixture it's a tasty healthier option to queso!
