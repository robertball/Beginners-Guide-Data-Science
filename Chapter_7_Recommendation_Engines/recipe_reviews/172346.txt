I have made a similiar recipe for about 20 years now.  Once you have tried this relish you never want to go back to store bought.  The difference between this recipe & mine is.. I use apple cider vinegar, 4 cups sugar, 1 TBSLP dry mustard & 1/8 cayenne pepper and a 2 tsp. cornstarch.  I found mine just perfect for sweetness.  So, to all you relish users..... try it...You'll love it!!!!

I made 2 versions.  First one was as written and it was really good...but a little too sweet for our tastes...would be great on a hotdog!  2nd version, I reduced the sugar to 2 cups, and added 5 finely chopped and seeded jalapenos.  I will make this EVERY year.  Easy prep...doesn't involve a 4 day process..  Great recipe!

This recipe may not be safe for canning due to lower acidity!

With every addition you make of peppers, onions etc...you are lowering the acidity of this product. Using anything other than 5% vinegar will also render it unsafe. Water bath canning may not be appropriate.

Remember...Botulism is deadly. "I haven't killed anyone yet'' isn't a good excuse.

Please consult your extension office or contact the Ball Canning hotline prior to making this. They can assist you in determining the safety of these old recipes.

Thank you for submitting this recipe! This is a wonderful use for the zucchini that seem to take over my garden over night. The only change I made was to sub a little of the white vinegar with cider vinegar as I was about 1/2 cup short. I used half-pint jars and processed for ten minutes. This is a keeper and I will be making it again and again!

I adapted this recipie and used my B&B Zucchini process technique - - shred the Zukes, prep the onions, add the two together then toss with the salt.  Cover the mixture with a layer of ice cubes, cover the bowl, and then place in the refidgerator.  Chill for 3 - 6 hrs.  I did not find any need to go the full overnight method.   

Substituted Apple Cider Vinegar and added 1 Tablespoon slightly cracked Mustard Seed, reduced Sugar to 2 cups, omitted the Corn Starch, added 2 diced red Jalapeno peppers .  If you really want it thicker - I suggest Clear Gel - a modified starch for canning and pie fillings.  Clear Gel is just that, clear, no clouding and very reasonable. - this is wonderful and the acidity is safe per my Ph Paper test.

Great recipe, my review is for the recipe as stated. However, 6 cups of sugar, in my opinion is way too much.  The ratio of sugar to vinegar should be the same.  I used 2 cups of sugar and apple cider vinegar instead of white.  I will definitly make this again with those changes.

We love the flavor of this zucchini relish and found that it is easier than I thought to can. One reader mentioned concern over the safety of canning this recipe.  Their concern was over the acidity, because of the addition of peppers and onions.  However, this recipe actually calls for less peppers then the Ball book of home preserving. That means there should be no issue or concern with the hot water bath method of canning as long as you follow directions. I actually like this recipe better then the Ball recipe because of the seasonings used here. Also, this recipe calls for one less pepper resulting in what I feel is a better flavor. I do add one half teaspoon of mustard seed because I like that flavor included in my relish.  Two recommendations, 1) you could use ClearJel (a modified cornstarch made to withstand heat) instead of the cornstarch. Mix the clear gel with the sugar first before adding it to the rest of the mixture.  2), leave 1/2 inch headspace in the canning jar and you will run into less problems.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I have been making this relish for years.  This is better than any sweet pickle relish I have ever had.  Really yummy on hot dogs! I also make this with splenda for a sugar free version. Try it you'll like it : )

Love it! I did make a couple changes though. I used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar and left out the cornstarch. I will use this recipe again!

This is my first year growing my own vegetables and to my surprise, I have zucchini coming out of my ears. I think I have made every zucchini 'something' you could think of. I stumbled across this recipe and thought I'd give it a go. I've never canned anything before so I was a little gun shy because after all the work, I didn't want to fail. So I jumped in. I followed the instructions and wala! - sweet zucchini relish. It's by far, the most popular thing I've made and everyone begs me for more or just helps themselves to a jar when they're over. The first time I made it, I forgot the onions but everyone raved about it so apparently no one noticed. Now I include the onions and people still rave about it. My sister and 13 yr old nephew like to eat it as salsa with chips. I don't think there's a wrong way to eat this. I have other friends who buy food around my relish. Who knew zucchini relish could have so much power? Great recipe.

I've been looking for a way to use up some of the zucchini from my garden, so when I found this recipe, I was very excited.  I made it today, and it is soooooooo good!!!  I only got 5 1/2 pint jars out of it instead of the 7, though.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I will definitely keep it for next year, and maybe even make more this year if I get a lot more zucchini.

I only had about 4 cups of zucchini so I substituted green tomatoes for the rest.  I also added some mustard seeds just because I think mustard seed should always be in relish.  Turned out fabulous!!

The garden is producing so many zucchinis, we can't eat them fast enough!  I found this recipe and with the suggestions of others made the relish and boy do we ever like it.  I am going to make my second batch next week.  Suggestions were to cut the sugar down to 2 1/2 c., added 3 chopped jalapenos, used apple cider vinegar and a 1/2 T. of dry mustard.  Thanks everyone for your suggestions.

I halved the sugar in the first batch and it was still plenty sweet, so next batch I only used 1/3 and still sweet.  Great tasting and very easy to make.  Will definitely make again next year.

Thankyou soooooo much for this recipe! I love it. I didn't put 6 cups of sugar, 2 cups is much better for teste. The other thing that I did diferent is the vinegar, I made it with apple vinegar so it is not so strong the flavour.
Thanks again.

Wow.  I didn't realize how easy it was to make a sweet relish and get rid of too much zucchini.  This was great.  Will be giving some away for christmas.

This relish is delicious!  I followed the recipe except 1 thing.  I didn't have green pepper, so I added hot peppers from my garden.  It turned out great!  I gave many jars away and got many glowing  reviews in return.  I will be making more next year for sure.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

Such a great relish! I fell in love with it! I did reduce the sugar like others mentioned down to 4 cups and it's still pretty sweet! Mine only yielded 4 1/2 pints instead of the seven, but that's still plenty! I mixed my white vinegar with apple cider vinegar and it gave it a nice flavor!

They weren't kidding when they called this "Sweet" Zucchini Relish. It's REALLY sweet. I halved the recipe, and only got 1 1/2 jars out of it. I'll likely make this again - but I might adjust the sweetness a bit. I think taking it down by 1/2 a cup would be a huge benefit.

SO delicious!! I cut way back on the sugar as suggested in other reviews. I doubled the recipe and only used 5c sugar. It is still very sweet. With a double recipe, I got 11 pints. I squeezed out as much water as I could after rinsing it, and am glad I did, as it would have been very watery otherwise. It is the perfect consistency and I can't wait to BBQ burgers again and have it!

Used this recipe last year. It was my first time ever canning and quite frankly, it went over TOO well. I will be using this recipe again! It has become a staple! :)

This is a great relish. Love it on hotdogs and in beans.  Have canned for years and made many types of pickles, but this is the best relish I have made.

Was looking for a good starting point to use my zucchini...but wanted some zest.  Substituted five cups of peppers (3 habaneros, 12 jalapeños, and the rest anaheims) for three of the cups of zucchini and ended up with The Best Darned Relish in Washington!  I sat down and ate all the remains that would not fit in the jars with a spoon!

I had to change my review!  After it sat for a while, it turned into one of my favorites!  It is so easy to make, and I'm adding hot peppers to the next batch.  I'd suggest anyone wanting to make relish...try this one!  Only thing I would comment on, is to chop the zucchini instead of shredding it. The texture seems better when chopped.  Have fun with making this recipe!

Easy and very good!  I also used cider vinegar since it is what I had on hand.  I used a large zuccini that had been in the fridge a few days so the skin was tough and the relish came out a little crunchy.  Still fabulous.

Fantastic flavor and appearance and a great way to use up some of the monstrous zucchini in my garden.  I followed the instructions to a T and all worked out well.  Thank you so much for posting this.  We now, proudly, have 10 12oz jars of this in our root cellar.

Wow, I made these this morning and I got to taste some of the leftovers from scrapping the pot. I somehow overlooked the onions and forgot to put them in but it still tasted great. I got 11 jelly jars full of relish with this recipe. Putting them in a basket full of home made goodies for Christmas this year. Definately will be one I will make year after year. Except I won't forget the onions next time. Thanks for sharing!!

This is a very good zucchini relish recipe. I made just a few adjustments. I used a roasted red pepper, and I used only four cups of sugar instead of six cups. The relish is plenty sweet with the lesser amount of sugar. In fact, I thought it's still almost too sweet. I used my food processor to make quick work of the shredding and chopping. I processed the jars for 10 minutes (I've never proceesed any other relish for 30 minutes!) I only got about 5 1/2 pints from this recipe. This reminds me of my grandmother's relish. Loved it.

Tastes great with some revisions... 1.5 times the recipe fills seven 500ml jars perfectly and uses 18 cups grated zucchini! I squeezed the water by hand from the zuke/onion mixture after rinsing and draining. Sugar was reduced from 9 c to 3.5 cups; for vinegar I split it evenly between white and apple cider; added 1 T dry mustard and 6 finely diced jalapenos. Deelish!

It tastes great.  It is the only relish we use anymore.  That said, I felt uncomfortable with the processing method, though it certainly seems adequate, provided you use 5% acidity vinegar.  In any case, a phone call to Ball informed me that according to this recipe, 15 minutes boiling water bath was adequate.  Note, though: Sugar adds acidity, (hydrogen) so don't go changing the amount

This is close to zucchini syrup!  I'm new to canning, so I trusted the "6 cups of sugar".  Meanwhile my gut was asking me "are you making candy or something?".  

Unless your household is filled with sugar addicts, this recipe is way too sweet.  I think I will have to rinse mine before using.

I have been making this relish for many years. For anyone concerned about the low acidity and question if it's safe to can, it actually freezes well. I just put it up in containers and freeze. 
I believe one reason it calls for so much sugar is to make it safe. So you can safely reduce the sugar if you freeze it.

I only used 3 1/2 C sugar, still pretty sweet, good thought, next time I'll use like 2C and add some pickling spice, I added about 1/2 tsp of mustard seed.  Confused on the size thought.  I used about 13 to 14 C zucchini (packed Cups), I made 1/2 pints jars so I would have more but it only made 9 half pint jars, was expecting 14 plus a little extra to toss in the fridge.  Over all it was going, but would like to have more of a dill pickle kind.

WOW! very good! I took the advice of oher reviwers and cut the sugar to 2 1/2 cups and it was the right balance between sweet & sour. I also used cider vinegar. I didn't jar it as I knew I was going to use it in recipes for the week and give to family to try. I'll have to go back to the farmers market and get more zucchini.

This is a great recipe just tried it and it is a real keeper. I am making a second batch tomorrow. I added a hot pepper and decreased the amount of sugar to 2 1/2 cups and is sweet enough for us. Thank you Gail for a wonder way to use zucchini.

I reduced the sugar to 3 cups and doubled the corn starch to keep the thickness. It was perfect! I took it to work and all enjoyed. Next batch I added some chopped hot peppers to spice it up!

This turned out great!  As others suggested, I cut the sugar back to about 2 1/2 cups and put a little apple cider vinegar in it.  I also added a couple chopped jalepeno's that didn't make it spicy, but gave it another level of flavor.  I didn't take the time to let it sit overnight in the fridge so I just added a little more salt and left it in the fridge for 2 hours instead. Will definitely make more of this with zucchini out of our garden this summer.

I have looked forever for this recipe that was my Mothers.  Lost it several years ago and this is exactly it, except she used half yellow crook neck squash.  Otherwise the same.  Thank you so much! I use 1/2 cup in baked beans and serve with winter beans,; pintos and white navy beans.

This is the second summer I have made this with all of my garden zucchini, and I have to say, I can eat it by itself!  I made a few changes to it this year: I omitted the nutmeg and added curry powder and cumin.  I love to look at recipes and get ideas from them, but it's always hard for me to follow one exactly.  Everyone's taste is different, of course.  

I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who loves relishes and has a lot of zucchini to use!  More next year, indeed!

This is the second year for me to make this zucchini relish and once again I won a blue ribbon at the fair. It is incredible!! I make mine with more yellow zucchini so it looks a bit different, but tastes just as good.

This relish won over two skeptics.  My dad who hates zucchini and me who has never been a big relish fan.  All I've heard since this year's zucchinis have started coming has been - "Make more zucchini relish like last year!"  So glad that I had put this recipe in my allrecipes recipe box - I'll need it every year!

Rather than giving my friends extra zucchini, I am passing out jars of this relish.  It's perfect on a grilled chicken sandwich!

This relish is nice and sweet.  If you're looking to add a little kick try addinng chopped jalepeno peppers.  I added 2 finely chopped jalepeno peppers but it was still quite mild and didd't add much kick.  Next time I will try adding 4. Great recipe! Everyone that has tried wants the recipe.

Another great base recipe! I used half gold half green zucchinni this year, and due to an onion miscalculation, I used a red onion too. What a difference from last year! Lots of great flavors. Don't get me wrong, last years was awesome as well, this is just different in an amazing way!

This was for sure a 5 star recipe, however, the only thing that did not go as planned, according to the recipe, is I only ended up with 8 cups of relish (or four 2 cup jars) instead of the 7 indicated in the recipe.  And I even added 2 extra cups of grated zucchini because someone else said they only got 5 jars.    I also added the recommended amount of turmeric and another table spoon just because it is really good for you and we like it and 1 tbsp of celery seed for the same reason.    Guess it's back to the garden for another zucchini to get another 4 more jars!  LOL   Thanks for this wonderful recipe to use up my BIG zucchinis!

Wonderful recipe that uses a lot of zucchini. On the advice of others, I used less sugar and am glad I did.  I used 1/2 cup less sugar but wish I'd used 1 cup less.  Is still a bit too sweet but is very, very good!  Will be making this for years to come!  I did the water bath for only 10-15 min. instead of the 30, which I feel is way too long based on many other similar recipes.

I love this recipe! I've made it 5 times in the last week. My husband likes it with a little more heat, so I added 2 hot peppers - with seeds - to two of the batches. Thanks for submitting it.

This is excellent relish, the only thing I changed was I added a couple jalapenos chopped.  This gives it just a little zest to it.

My garden is overflowing with zucchini and now I have found the perfect thing to do with it!  Loved this recipe.  I did add some jalapeno to the mix to spice it up and dropped one cup of the sugar.

I lost my zucchini relish recipe and it has been so sad.  Thank you for making this recipe available.  This is the best zucchini relish and it is the old recipe that I had.  My family is so happy to eat good relish again. You are awesome.

We make this every year and it's always a hit with us and also our guests! We leave out the cornstarch and it's still plenty thick. This recipe is a really great way to use up all the zucchini we have in our garden every autumn.

A friend made this recipe exactly as written and it was so delicious I decided to make it for myself with variations based on what I had.

I kept all measurements the same with the exception of the sugar. Based on reviews, I used 2 cups, and it was pure cane sugar. I also used 10 cups of squash and 2 cups zucchini because I had more of one than the other. Cider vinegar instead of white. Orange pepper instead of red. Plenty sweet, lots of zing. 

It only made 4 pints for me with a half cup leftover that I ate with a spoon. So delicious.

We also did a batch where we kicked it up a notch and added some red cracked pepper to the brine and erythritol for a hot/sweet combo that is low carb/sugar free.

I made 2 batches of this simultaneously.  One batch just as written and one batch I added Jalapenos to the mix.  So I have a sweet relish and a sweet hot relish.  I marked the jar lids with a sharpie before I water bathed them just to make sure that nobody got a surprise.   My house smelled like a hot dog cart!  This is very yummy and between the 2 batches, I got 14 pints.. just like the recipe predicted.

If you don't have red peppers, green will do.  The relish will just miss the extra pop of the red color in the mix.  Tastes the same!

I followed the recipe for the most part. I substituted a couple of jalapeño peppers and added a tsp of ground mustard powder. I also cut the sugar down to 4 cups and used apple cider vinegar. The recipe turned out great and I can't wait to try it at the next cookout!

Found this recipe this year while looking for something to do do with all my zucchini.  It is delicious.  Family loves.  Will be making again next year.  May cut down on the sugar just a bit, but it is great the way it is.  Thanks.

Good recipe! As other suggested, I cut the sugar to 2 cups, 1 cup white vinegar, 1 cup apple cider vinegar and 1 tsp mustard seed. I also added 2 jalapenos (should have done 4!) and only  cooked the mixture for 15mins  as it  got to the thickness i wanted. I cooked in water bath for 10 mins.

Great recipe for a relish my mother used to make.  My dad loved to plant gobs and so we were always looking for a way to use them.  I agree 6 C sugar is waaaaay too much.  Am making it again and will use only 2 C sugar.  Also left out the peppers as I have friends who are allergic.  It's  no great loss to the overall taste.  Subbing in cider vinegar also will add complexity to flavor.  like also the idea of adding mustard seed. Glad to have the suggestion about the ice cubes and 4-6 hrs chill instead of overnight.  I need to make something all at once when I have a sliver of time!

Really like the taste of this relish.  Only got 5-1/2 pts. so next time I will increase ingredients slightly. Made a couple changes, only added 2-1/2c sugar and used 2-1/2c apple cider vinegar.  Also added 1/2 tsp. of dry mustard.

With my food processor this was embarrassingly easy to make! My first time water bath canning, 2jars didn't seal but they taste so good we'll be eating them soon. Better to leave a 1/2 inch of head space in the jars. I did use half apple cider vinegar and half white since that's what I had on hand, and used only 2cups of sugar. Red & yellow peppers, no green. Very forgiving recipe, thank you for sharing!

I made this relish and then canned it.  At first I thought it was going to be awful because it smelled horrible while cooking but once finished, canned, chilled and later opened..it was very good (and didn't smell bad).  We enjoyed it on gilled hot dogs and hamburgers.  I did reduce the sugar amount but that was really the only adjustment I made.  Thanks!

Excellent ! Very good with vegtables. However 6 cups of sugar is just too much. Will adjust next batch.

This is a very good recipe for hot dog, hamburger or sandwich topping.
The only change I would suggest is a little less sugar. As prepared it is a little to sweet for me.

Love this relish. Been looking for this recipe for awhile. Made a couple changes by adding extra half cup of vinegar and used red and yellow peppers, no green. This is great on hot dogs, hamburgers, sandwiches, and to make tartar sauce.

Awesome!!!!  Made as written, with the exception of using only 3 cups of sugar and processed in half pint jars for 10 minutes.  Our first attempt at canning - YUM!!!!  Easy!!

I was perhaps too conscientious in squeezing too much liquid out of the zucchini, and the concoction ended up a little dry to pack in the jars, so I added a little water toward the end of simmering.  I used 2 cups sugar, and it tastes yummy.  Far better than the horrid store bought stuff.  I got 5 pints.

This relish turned out perfectly. Hubby loves it! I did not have any red bell pepper on hand, tasted delicious without it. Will continue to use this recipe in the future.

Sounds like a plan for this years garden. I think I may add some hot banana peppers to give it a little zip. It will probably be good on a steak or grilled chicken sandwich too. :)

This recipe is absolutely FABULOUS!  I too will never make relish with cucumbers (they are harder for me to grow) and now my abundance of zucchini will never go to waste.  You can't tell the difference and the flavor is awesome.  Even my kids love this on hot dogs!

I just made this today... my first attempt at canning ANYTHING!  After reading so many of the reviews, I did add some diced red hot peppers, about 4 small ones.  Everything else I kept the same as the recipe, including processing for the full 30 min. Although it was a little more liquidy than I expected, the relish was delicious.  And, I didn't break any jars which, in itself, was a success!  It made 5 pint jars with a little left over that I'm currently enjoying over some turkey.
When I make it again, which I will, I will use smaller jars as I think a pint is too much for relish.

Thanks for making my first attempt at canning a breeze!

made this recipe with yellow zucchini (buttersticks) and purple onions because that's what I had on hand. Very pretty and delicious. Maybe next time will add a shredded carrot for color... Only put in 4 cups of sugar per previous comments, mater of preference I think. I will make this again!!!

I reduced the sugar by half and doubled the remaining ingredients. It came out perfect and everyone raves over how good this is and it still taste sweet. I did not have pickling salt so I used a good (Eden brand) sea salt, worked great and did not turn the zucchini brown.

I finely chopped the zucchini, peppers, and onion. I was off a little on my amount of zucchini so it only made 6 1/4 pints. Tastes great but a touch runny. My fault. I wouldn’t change it at all!

Excellent recipe. For those concerned about canning, it is perfectly safe. Much like canning cucumbers for pickles. The vinegar and salt are the preservatives as well as the sugar.  Boiling also kills bacteria. Squash relish is absolutely amazing. I have made it many times with a recipe very similar to this. A must in every canners kitchen :).

Have made my mom's version of this recipe, which calls for only 4 cups sugar and cider vinegar.  I prefer zucchini relish over pickle relish.   We eat it on hot dogs, w
on ham and beans, in potato salad, tuna salad, and egg salad.  Used this to cross-reference some of the steps!

I've made this several times. As well as the tested approved one in Bernardin. The only real difference between them is sugar content. I do use 4 cups of sugar instead of the six but it's still more than the bernardin recipe. The bernardin recipe also calls for horseradish (yikes) which is also a low acid. So I feel very confident this one is safe with a boil water bath at 15 minutes full boil.  I do like this recipe better. OMIT the cornstarch for safety.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I could not taste or see the difference between zucchini and cucumbers.  You will never buy relish from a store once you make your first batch.  (That's a guarantee).   :)

My advice... don't change a thing. I thought the amount of sugar sounded crazy... nope! It is the perfect amount of sweetness. I made one batch and my family raved about it. Have another batch started.  It's the best thing I've ever had on hot dogs and Italian sausages. Thank you for this easy, delicious recipe!!

I made 2 batches last week. It is delicious. I eat it with everything. On hot dogs it is awesome. On sandwiches and fresh vegetables with biscuits is delicious. Got 3 more batches in fridge and will be making them soon. I think I am going to put a little heat in these. Not to hot just a little ting.

This is delicious and is so much prettier that the gray pickle relish that one buys at the grocery store.  I never put any other relish on hot dogs, since I made this.

Hi, I made this relish recently, but halved the ingredients just to try it out. I didn't put so much sugar in it, and also added 1/4 cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit. It was beautiful! So am now doing a full batch, but using 1kg zucchini and 1/2kg red onions. Shall halve the amount of sugar. Five stars for this recipe from Australia.

I cut the sugar to 3 cups, and added 2 tablespoons cornstarch instead of 1. I used my chopper ( not  electric ) used the small cube cutter just the right size.  I tasted it and will use this recipe again.

Love it! I'm going to reduce the salt by 1 tbs next time, as it's slightly too salty for me. We had it paired with a cheese board and another relish - green tomato.

halved the sugar, used cider vinegar and added a couple of jalapenos.   Oh it is good right out of the pot.   Can hardly wait.

Great use of the plethora of garden zucchini. Excellent taste, better than store bought, by far. I cut the sugar by about one cup and added a small jalapeño. I’m excited to see how it is.  Easy recipe to make. Plan ahead for best results.

Will make it again … I only used  5 cups sugar and found it very sweet but really good. To my taste I will add crushed chili peppers to give it a little more zing and less sugar but I will keep this recipe for sure and make it again for years ...one of the best I have tried .

I saw someone chewing people out because they rated the recipe and made changes to it. I am so grateful for those people who shared what they did to alter the recipe! It helped me to make substitutions based on what I had on hand, plus recommendations that helped me to get the results I wanted, and not waste time and food. 
I reduced sugar to 4 Cups, used apple cider vinegar, added mustard seed, and 1/2 habanero pepper, I wrung out my drained zucchini in a pillow case to get less watery final product. 
This relish was delish, not too spicy. I will do 3 Cups sugar next round. Also, pack your zucchini when you measure, or you may get less jars, like I did.
I find it a bit scary trying new canning recipes because I don't want to make something that I don't like to use or share and waste time. Thanks to all who gave their advice!

I found this a bit too sweet, backing off on the sugar helps. HOWEVER, I did NOT can it. I froze it in small containers, and  pull one out as needed. Never alter alter a canning recipe unless you want botulism.

This recipe is a great use for zucchini, it's a big hit. I've made it 3 times now and the only alteration I make is the sugar, I use 2 cups per batch, it's plenty sweet enough. Thanks for sharing your grandma's recipe

Absolutely delicious. With the great harvest we've had, I easily doubled the recipe with wonderful results.
Had a taste test among friends and they immediately reserved a few jars once we finished canning.
This is now our go-to recipe that has found its well deserved place in our family collection.

I’m a novice cook but the family loves this stuff!  Used only half the onions.  Substituted yellow peppers for green, and used artificial sweetener for half of the total sugar.  Still really sweet !

This was really delicious...I even top my steak with it!  I did tweak it a bit by using apple cider vinegar instead of white, cutting the sugar to 5 cups (4 would have probably been enough), and adding 3/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  Thanks for sharing your family's recipe!

I must add a qualifier to my 4 stars. I did not make this as the recipe stated. The changes I made are:  substituted 1 cup of apple cider vinegar in addition to the 1 1/2 cups white vinegar (still 2 1/2 cups total); thanks to previous reviewers, I reduced the sugar to just over 2 cups; added a chopped jalapeño; left out the nutmeg and added a rounded teaspoon of mustard seed. This now very closely resembles the recipe I lost from 35 years ago. It’s delicious.

WOW!! THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE.  I followed suggestions of others on this site and cut the sugar to 2 1/2 cups!  My relish was perfect and easy to make.  My husband loved it.  He made chicken salad and added the relish to the mix.  Really enhanced the chicken salad.  This relish is going to be made over and over again. Thanks for sharing!

I made this to the recipe and it is delicious!  My family have all tried it and love it as well, even the zucchini neutral kid!  I'd probably change out some of the capsicum for chilli in the next batch for a bit of zing but otherwise this is a hit and a great way to use the zucchini bumper crop this year from my garden!

I used yellow and orange and pepper instead of green. I don't eat onion, so I omitted that.
Very important to REALLY squeeze the water from the grated zucchini, because I didn't, and it's a tad too watery for my liking.
The taste was fabulous!
Yes! I would make again!!

This is a great recipe and very good with fish dishes. The only thing I didn't go was put them in the boiling bath. I just fill the bottles and put them away. Still very good a year later. I never can my pickles and have never had a problem.

Made this for the first time this year...and we love it!  I sure won't be buying sweet pickle relish at the store ever again. I did cut the sugar back to 2 1/2 cups, personal preference, other than that...perfect! Next year I'm going to experiment with a different vinegar and some jalapenos for a spicer relish for them grilled hot dogs. O.... and this is awesome in potato salad too! Thank you Gail.

This was SO Good! I also followed the advise of another reviewer who said it was too sweet.  I thought that 6 cups of sugar sounded like too much so I used 2.  I also used more zucchini than what was called for.  I did add some dry mustard also.  I made 4 1/2 pints.  I used some of it during a cook out we had and everyone was asking for the recipe.  I ended up giving up two pints to a few good friends.  I have so much zucchini that I plan on make several more pints to store away! Thank you for the great recipe!! :)

I made two batches of this in the last couple of days.  It simply is one of the best tasting relish recipes I've ever had. I did modify it by cutting the sugar in half and using half apple cider vinegar and half white vinegar.  Its still plenty sweet with half the sugar.
I origonally was going to try two different relish recipes but the first batch was so good I just duplicated it using up a lot of extra zucchini from my garden.
Highly recommended.

I compared this recipe to one a local lady gave me. The differences between then are nominal. Most ingredients being exact. One minor difference, for example; green, instead of yellow bell pepper.  And some slight alteration  to amounts used. I am sure this would be a great Zucchini Relish recipe to use.   My local friends' family and people she meets through her family from around the world - love it, amazed by its taste and flavor. It is very good. I bet it would be hard for anyone without the taste-buds of a chef to really tell the difference.

OH, I just noticed a big change in the sugar content. This  online recipe uses 6 cups.  As I read the reviews, I realized, that would be way too sweet for me too.  - (Sometimes sugar content is allowed to be  to taste.)   4 1/2 cups for my lady's recipe - and some reviews went even less than that .  It really doesn't change the flavor or the nature of the relish - just the sweetness, that being said, I'm not sure I'd like to try it without sugar at all.

I may add that IF making jelly or jam - DON'T CHANGE the sugar content of the recipe unless you know what you are doing. It just doesn't work - I've done that.

Great stuff,  this relish. And it really has been easy to store in jars that have been properly prepared and cleaned.

This is an excellent relish.  It uses up quite a bit of excess zucchini and onions from the garden.  Even though this is an older recipe, I found the exact same proportions in the Ball Home Preserving Book (minus horseradish and hot peppers!). The PH strip came out perfect for water bath canning.  I may never made pickle relish again.

Just made  it.  But, I only got 4 pints.  Also, I have a sweet tooth, but I think it has to much sugar in it.  Other than that it is  good.

This is a delicious sweet relish. I was surprised by how much sugar was in it, but I followed the directions, and I am so glad that I did. The sweetness mellows somewhat after it is jarred for a while. I would definitely make this again. I may try chopping the onions and zuke instead of shredding them, as that would hopefully give it a chunkier consistency.

We love this recipe.  I use the relish in everything ...potato salad, macaroni salad, chicken salad, and deviled eggs.  We put it on hamburgers and hot dogs, too.  I cut the sugar in it by using Truvia blend.  Great stuff.

This is the zucchini relish I have enjoyed from my mom's garden for over 40 years. Now that she's got grandkids, the relish has come to be known as "Grandma Gail's Relish". When I found the recipe online under the author's name of "Gail", I wondered how my mother's name ended up on the internet. She never uses computers. Is it possible one of my siblings or cousins posted it for her?  No matter the origins, every cookout is made complete with a jar of this relish. We use it in potato salad in place of pickle relish too.

Yum. Already sold 5 jars. I love it, family loves it. I agree with Rachel adding the mustard and cayenne pepper and 4 cups of sugar. I did use the white vinager instead of the cider vinager. Just perfect.

Great recipe and a huge hit! I only used 3 cups of sugar as recommended by others. I split the pot in half, made some as is as a sweet relish and the other half, I added 2 large jalapeno peppers and 1 serrano pepper (seeds and all), what a nice kick along with the sweet! yum! Will be making more for sure soon.

This is just delicious! It's so good. I got five pints out of the recipe. Halved the sugar content. Added 1-1/2 teaspoons of dry mustard and 1 teaspoon of hot pepper flakes. Used 2 cups of cider vinegar and 1/2 cup of white vinegar. And I squeezed, squeezed, and then squeezed the zucchini and onions in a clean dishtowel to eliminate as much moisture as I could. You'd be surprised how much moisture was in the zucchini mixture, even after draining for a good 30 minutes.

I should add that I made three batches and I got five pints from each batch. I'd say that you can get five pints, not seven. Nonetheless, this is an excellent recipe.

YUM!  I followed Rachel's suggestion and made recipe with 2 c sugar, cider vinegar and added 3 T prepared mustard and 6 jalapenos. I also added in a few apples, apricots and a peach I had lying around needing to be used up.  Everyone loves it!  Will definitely be making this again.

It was good but way too sweet.  Next time I will cut the sugar to 4 cups.  I will also substitute apple cider vinegar next time.

This recipe is great. We love it so much that I won't buy store bought again!! It is great on hamburgers, hot dogs and anything else you use relish for.

Wonderful, wonderful recipe!  Made 10 half-pint jars yesterday.  Following tips from others I cut the sugar down to 2-1/2 cups.  It was still a tad too sweet but absolutely delicious. Will cut sugar by 1/4 cup next time.

Just made this recipe today, exactly as written and I must say I too am now a fan!  This was the first year that I planted zucchini in my garden and it really took off.  I never heard of zucchini relish but wanted to use up some so I thought I'd just give it a try.  Was this ever a surprise!  I will definitely be making this again and again.  Next time I may reduce the sugar a little, use apple cider vinegar and will add some hot peppers to give it zing.  It is wonderful as written though, so do give it a try.

Also, I was looking in my All American canner cook book and found the same recipe only they made it out of zucchini slices for pickle chips.  It said to only process for 10 minutes and it did say to use water bath, so it is definitely a safe recipe, so don't be concerned about it not being safe.

EDIT: Tonight I baked chicken legs in the oven @ 400F for one hour.  I then put some of this relish on each piece and let it cook about 10-15 minutes more.  OUT OF THIS WORLD!  My advice, don't limit yourself to just hamburgers & hot dogs with this recipe.  Experiment because it is worth it's weight in gold! 

And do shred the zucchini as stated in the recipe.  It makes it stay together better when you put it on something.

 I can't stop raving about this recipe.

This was my first venture with zucchini relish...I am impressed! What a great way to use all that garden zucchini. Based on reviews and my own personal taste, I reduced the sugar to 2 cups but will probably increase to 3 or 3.5 next time. Also used apple cider vinegar but didn't have tumeric but will add it next time. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this at the end of the harvest and let me tell you I couldn't keep the jars at home.  I did like most and cut the sugar back to 2 cups.  It was the right amount of sweetness.  My 5yo likes to eat it right off her plate, forget the hot dog.  :)

This also makes an excellent hot dog relish! I also add a few hot peppers to spice it up a little bit. I also skip the nutmeg, use part cucumbers, part summer squash, add some mustard seed and it is still Very, Very good! You can use less sugar if you want it less sweet. Awesome!

I had way too much zucchini from my garden this year so I decided to try this recipe to use up some of it. I can't believe how wonderful it is!!! I cut the sugar in 1/2 as some of the other reviewers suggested, but other then that I kept the recipe the same. My husband and all 3 of our kids have been putting in on everything, hot dogs, hamburgers, even sandwiches. This recipe is definitly a keeper!

It is sweet!  first time I followed the recipe and found it a little too sweet for me but an excellent recipe thats easy to follow.  Second time I peeled zucchini for another dish and used only the peels to make the relish.  skipped the overnight soak, cut the sugar to 5 cups, added a habanero pepper, 1/2 tsp dried mustard and 1/2 tsp southwest chipotle seasoning mix.  Still a sweet relish but now you notice other flavous as well giving it more depth

Amazing!  I did not have Zucchini but had tons of yellow cucumbers.  Kept everything the same except that I used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar.  I used to never like relish on my hot dogs but now I do!  Can't wait to hear the comments at our upcoming birthday party!!!  Thanks for sharing! :)

Sixth year with this recipe. Four cups of sugar is about right for us. Too much celery seed for our taste. We use 3/4 tsp. To yield 7 pints I firmly pack four cup pyrex 3 times. Jalapenos are a super enhancement. If you follow preparation instructions you will have Zucchini Mush. Do not let relish exceed 185 deg F during preparation or canning process.

So good!  Wonderful way to use that zucchini that won't go away.  I had to use a cup of brown sugar, because I ran out of white.  I scaled the total sugar down by one cup because of that.
