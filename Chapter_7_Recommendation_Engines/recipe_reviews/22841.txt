Someone please help me out. I followed the recipe and the directions exactly and in the morning the cookies were still soft. Plus they stuck to the foil paper. Maybe I should have greased it? Should I have kept the cookies in the turned on oven for a few minutes before I turned the oven off? What I did in the morning is turn the oven back on for a few minutes on low and the cookies were ready soon after that. They came out delicious but I wish I didn't have to do that extra step. What did I do wrong?

Also, I think chocolate chips are extra, I just added chopped almonds and a little bit of sugar, and the taste was just right.

Thank you for the recipe. Please give me more direction for I want to try this again.

Great recipe, easy to follow.  I was raised on it without the chocolate chips or nuts...just as a meringue.

For the reviewer who had to turn her oven back on...is your oven gas?  If so, that's your problem.  Electric oven coils retain heat for awhile after you've turned them off, while gas ovens start cooling almost immediately.  If it is a gas oven, I'd preheat the oven, then when you put the cookies in, drop the temp to the lowest possible...they'll be ready in less than a few hours, dependant on your oven.

They came out literally, just like the picture!  I doubled the recipe in my 5 quart kitchen aid mixer just fine.  I was baking them for a breast cancer awareness fundraiser so I used red food coloring in the final mixing stages to make the meringue pink before folding in the mini semi-sweet chips and chopped peanuts and they took to a nice pink color.
They also didn't spread when baking so I could pack the parchment lined cookies sheets closely with cookies and bake 2 batches simultaneously!  The hardest part of the recipe is not opening the oven before time is up!

I have made a version of this for years.  For the person who it did not work out right for her is my suggestion...First I grease and flour the cookie sheet(they will come right off@)  When you put them in the oven count to 30 then turn off the oven and let stand over night.  Sometime I get sidetracked cleaning something and they end up in there for a few minutes.  Add food coloring red and green for Christmas.

When making the meringue, I recommend adding about 1/8 teaspoon of cream of tartar and adding in the sugar gradually until it dissolves in the egg white mixture.  Instead of using chocolate chips, I put a Hershey's kiss chocolate in the center of each one.  These are light and fluffy cookies that everyone will like!

I've made these cookies before. I like to experiment with meringue cookies; I've gotten away with a dried cranberry and almond meringue before! I also alwas add food coloring, just to make them look more appetizing. (For example, red and green for Christmas). I also use colors when I make one batch with nuts and one without. One this about this cookie, though; I've had several people say "Mine didn't come out that good!" The BIGGEST keys are the parts of this recipe that mention ROOM TEMPERATURE and STIFF PEAKS. Too many people make it cold and go, like, "Oh! This is close enough." Or make soft peaks and say the same thing.

This is one of my favorite holiday recipies.  However, I make my cookies with milk chocolate chips and pecans.  Anytime I make these cookies I get multiple requests for the recipie.

I love this recipe and have been using it for years.  I'm a chocoholic, so I always omit the nuts and add an additional 3/4 cups of chocolate chips!  I use milk chocolate, though, because I like the taste of milk chocolate better than semi-sweet.  As always, use quality chocolate when making a recipe like this because it really comes through.

I made this and took them to a party and everyone raved about them!  They were pretty easy to make also - just be sure to mix longer than you probably think you should.

this recipe was great. i enjoyed making them. I used peacans instead of peanuts and they tasted great. My only advice to someone who has never made merengue is   to beat the egg whites and salt on high  until you get stiff peaks and then add your sugar. You wont get the same result if you do it the other way.

I've made this. It is very good! I love it! What I did though was just use egg whites, sugar, crushed peppermint sticks, and chopped nuts =) tastes great just like this!

Wonderful cookies.  Have won several baking contests at work.  (Thank you DoGirl)  I have tried them with dried fruit and people raved.  Tried just nuts, just chocolate, almost anything that is not too wet.  Two cautions.  USE PARCHMENT PAPER.  Important for the bottom.  Also they neither expand or shrink so make them bite sized.  If too big, they will not dry and your bottoms may just fall off.  Could not ask for a better cookie.

I grew up on these and this recipe turned out great!  I make them for Christmas so I used peppermint extract instead of vanilla with dark chocolate chips and no nuts-fantastic!!  Kids and adults love them.

I was reading some of the reviews complaining about running cookies. You have to beat the egg whites until they have a stiff peak ( a stiff peak is when you beat egg whites until peaks stand up straight when the beaters are lifted from the mixer bowl).Then fold in the nuts and chocolate

Mom always made these at Christmas, but no matter what I did with her recipe, they always came out sticky on the bottom, gooey in the middle, and I had to reheat them a bit, leading to them being browned.  I followed this recipe exactly, it's a tiny bit different than Mom's in the sugar ratio, and they came out PERFECTLY!  Make sure no yolk gets in the whites, and beat the heck out of the whites- it takes a long time, even with a hand mixer.  Add the sugar VERY slowly...good luck!

I have been making these for twenty years in some pretty strange locations and with differing equipment, and they've always turned out perfect left in the oven all night on foil. If they are not cooked through, troubleshoot the following: 1) Is the oven on the correct temperature? Buy an oven thermometer to check. 2) Are you peeking? You can't open the oven door before they are done--the oven will lose too much heat. 3) Are you beating your eggs to stiff peaks, or are they still on the soft side? 4) Are you folding in your vanilla by hand? Using a beater to add liquid ingredients will deflate merengue.  Hope they turn out next try!

my grandma made these cookies when I was a kid. she called them, "Bake while you sleep cookies."  anyway,  I tried to make them several times and always failed. I found out that it works best if you use eggs that are room temp. and add 1/8 tsp. cream of tartar to the egg whites about 1/2 way into mixing them.  I would continue with adding the sugar just like this recipe says and the rest of the recipe.  another  difference is I used chopped walnuts instead of peanuts, but I feel they would turn out just as good.  I would use parchment paper and spray it with non-stick spray. -lee

I just adore these!  They are so cool- light as air, kind of hard on the outside and melt-in-your-mouth on the inside.  I followed the recipe exactly, only I did add about 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar.  You should start with room temperature egg whites...I got mine in the bowl, and let them sit for about 30 minutes.  Cold whites means more mixing time.  Add the sugar veeerrrrryyyy slowly, and you really must mix and mix and mix- it takes quite some time.  Do not stop mixing to take a break- keep that motion going nonstop.  Patience is key- if you rush these, you will NOT get the results you want!  I have a gas oven and had no problems- just make sure you give it plenty of time to preheat, and then don't be tempted to peek- that lets the heat escape.  These came out perfect for me, and I am delighted!  I am going to play around with the add-ins (cranberry and almond maybe?), and will definitely color some from Christmas!  Fantastic recipe DOGIRL- thanks for sharing :)

Less stars if I could. A waste of good ingredients!  WAY too sweet, and they crumbled, too.  Just not my style of cookie or candy.

I tried making this with broken semi-sweet chocolate bits and almond nuts. Every mouth was fabulous. However, my cookies did not have a feet / base. It was soft at the bottom. Some quick research on the web told me it could be that my cookies were too big and therefore the bottom did not dry out. I preheated to 180 celsius again, turned off the oven, then popped the cookies back in for another 2 hours. They turned out fine except a few of the top cracked a little but still in one piece. I'd try again making smaller cookies, spooning the batter with a teaspoon instead of tablespoon this time round. I didn't manage to get the brown on my cookies like those in the pictures but crispy nonetheless.

This was a suprise hit with my family. Everyone doubted the cookies based on the ingredients but once they tasted them they loved them. I was happy to come across the recipe since I had them as a child but had forgotten how good they are.

Everyone loves these cookies!!  Well... maybe everyone its really a hate it or love it kinda thing. My friends are wild about these yummy cookies, and they are easy to make! I am think about trying to make a devils food cake with this as a topping(without nut or chips) So yummy! Only tip, dont make a really big batch at once, it takes a really long time to get the foam to peak, and dosent come out as good.

I absolutely love these cookies. My friends and family do as well and so I always double the recipe. Just make sure that absolutely no yellow touches the egg white or else it just won't work - no matter how long you keep whipping.

These literally became forgotten cookies! Made these after making some oatmeal cookies. Had a bit of a problem beating the egg whites, but I added some fresh lime juice and that helped the peaks forms. Scooped them into the cookie tin using an ice cream scoop (BIG No-NO as I later found out). Left the oven on at 350 while I did dishes (5 mins) and then turned it off and forgot about it until the next night after work (oops lol). When I took them out they did not change size from the way I scooped it, half had cracked and the other half were beautiful. (See Pic) Tried some and the top was heaven, very much like a meringue but the center was chewy. Also VERY VERY SWEET. These were good but in retrospect I would do the following changes:

-Less sugar, probably 1/2
-No chocolate chips
-Small scoops into cookie sheet, maybe teaspoon to make bite size pcs
-Add lime juice while beating eggs

I really liked this cookie as a change and more healthier.  (If there is such a thing as a healthier cookie)   My husband loved them but the kids didn't care for them.

Fantastic recipe! I am not super experienced in the kitchen and these came out perfectly the first time.   Careful not to overcook these - the cookies were ready to be eaten in 1.5 hours in my oven after following directions, so perhaps the first time making these, check your oven every hour or so to ensure you don't accidentally burn them.

The directions don't mention adding the salt unless I'm just missing that.  Anyway, adding the salt helps the egg white firm us for those of you have trouble getting your whites stiff.  Then add in your sugar a little at a time.  Also, the humidity outside WILL affect these cookies.  If it's damp they will not dry out over night and will stick to the foil.  Turn your oven on 200 and check them until they are firm to the touch, but not brown.  I've been making a very similar recipe for years and they are so yummy when they come out!

i halfed the recipe and didn't put the extras (chocolate and peanuts).  i don't have a mixer so i messed up the first batch beating the eggs by hand.  however after a simple online search, there were lots of videos out there so the second time after lots of beating (prob around 15-20 mins, it came out perfect)  i waited 30 secs to turn off the oven, but they were not completely dry in the morning. (i have a gas oven) so i turned on the oven again in the morning with the cookies inside for 5 mins and it came out deliciously but slightly overcooked.  so maybe next time i'll either wait a bit longer before turning off the oven or turn the oven on in the morning for only about 2-3 mins.

I've yet to have sucess with meringue.  I don't think I beat the egg whites long enough because mine turned out completly flat! They were still quite tasty, will make again beat egg whites longer.

Loved the cookies.  I made them with walnuts and mini chocolate chips.  Followed previous advise to add a pinch of cream of tartar to whites and kept oven on just for a couple of minutes before turning it off for the night.  The cookies were light, crisp on outside and slightly chewy inside.  I garnished some with pieces of walnut and they looked very pretty for Christmas plates.  What a tasty way to use up left-over egg whites.

My first true meringue success! We ended up sampling the cookies after about three hours, but they were mostly set by that point. A very good recipe, and not too difficult. I washed the utensils with lemon juice before hand, to cut down on grease.

I made the mistake of using the wrong side of aluminium foil. It has to be shiny side DOWN for meringue cookies. My sister used a silpat and that worked well also. I would also start to add sugar even before the egg whites are forming soft peaks, probably at the foamy stage, but very gradually. Also, be sure not to over-whip the whites, and try to fold in vanilla and chocolate chips with as little mixing as possible, as the whites will loose their airiness.

Here's a new version of this wonderful little cookie.
I used 1/2  semisweet chocolate chips and 1/2 green mint chips.  Also added a few drops of green food color to the meringue. 
Perfect addition of color for the holidays!

The meringue did not form stiff peaks. Probably because there was no cream of tartar or vinegar in the recipe. I've made cookies similiear to these before and that recipe had vinegar in it. These were still tasty the way the turned out but I will continue to look for other recipe I had.

Wonderful. I made these last night and they're gone already - it's not even noon! Hey, they're fat free and mostly air so who cares? I'd never made meringue before so I wasn't sure they'd turn out, but they did! Try this recipe! I will definitely be making these again.

These were absolutely delicious and beautiful. The only problem I had with them was getting them off the foil. Most of them broke as I tried to gently ease them off.

These are tasty treats for my family and they love them. Low in fat and sugar and sooo easy especially for those are gluten free, I cut the chocolate chips in half and add chopped peacans pieces half a cup.  At Christmas great for cookie exchanges too when you are a busy mom. I line my cookie sheets with parchment and load them in and forget them till morning NO burning them. How can you say AWESOME!

I had a great time making these meringues in a double batch.  The eggs whites and sugar made stiff peaks.  They are hardening in the oven.  My daughter and I love making them for a Holiday Party.

They turned out just like the picture. I left them in the oven over night and got them in the morning. Four stars only because I did not like the texture or taste of them, simply not for me but others liked them.

I have made these since I was a little girl in my grandmothers kitchen with an old coal stove. The cream of tartar is important and helps resolve the issue that another reviewer had with the cookies being soft. The oven needs to be turned off immediately after putting the cookie sheets in. It's also important not to open the oven to take a peek. I always pop these in the oven right before bedtime and leave a post it note so I don't forget about them all together!

Wonderful! I'm always torn about how to rate a recipe after I've made changes to it without making the recipe as posted.  That said, I added a pinch of cream of tartar as I was concerned about the stability of the meringue and omitted the chocolate chips.  I'd never heard of this method of baking meringues.  It's a wonderful finale for an afternoon of baking. I did find, however, that I could have easily doubled the recipe and have space in my oven (albeit on 2 shelves) with plenty of space for air flow around the pans.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe

These are so easy and yummy. I used mini semi sweet chocolate chips and omitted the peanuts because of allergies. They are so light and they melt in your mouth. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you for sharing it.

Great recipe! I subbed green and red Andes mint baking pieces, to make this a Christmas cookie.
