I have tried other flavored waters before most of them usually included mint, grapefruit, orange, cucumber, etc., I really enjoyed how beautiful this flavored water was, and it was quite refreshing!

Loved it.  Will make again and again even if not exact to the recipe, you can put what you have on hand in a pitcher and enjoy! Very easy.
