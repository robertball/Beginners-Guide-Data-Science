I would suggest if you like your peppers and onions more done to saute them a little first and then do the broiling.  Once the cheese is melted the veggies are still pretty raw.  I don't mind them too much this way and the sandwich was really delicious...just prefer them a little more cooked.  I also added a little fresh parsley and salt and pepper.  Used a hoagie roll b/c plain white bread just seemed a little plain.  Can't wait to try again!

Good recipe - But White Bread? I used a multigrain bread and it provided a fuller flavour, and a better health advantage.

Yum, yum, yum. For more tender veggies, definately saute them (except for the tomato) in the olive oil before putting on the bread. I also upgraded the bread to whole grain and used shredded Motzerella cheese. Smelled SO GOOD and tasted great too.

This was very good! I did saute all the veggies, except for the tomatoes beforehand to soften them a little in some olive oil, with a clove of minced garlic, salt and pepper, and then proceeded with the recipe. I also added some pepperjack cheese and that went well with the veggies. Also, I had a small baguette to use up, so I used that instead of the white bread. All in all a nice, quick and tasty sandwich that I would totally make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was fantastic!  I'm living abroad with a kitchen that has no stove/toaster oven, so I briefly stir-fried the vegetables in the olive oil (2-3 minutes), toasted the bread over the stove (watch carefully!  I obliterated one piece because I wasn't paying attention), and topped it with finely shredded cheddar cheese.  It was a hit with my boyfriend and definitely something I will make again, especially considering it took about fifteen minutes from start to finish (and I'm still slow at chopping vegetables).

We liked this a lot. while sauteing the onions and peppers like others have suggested, we added a clove of minced garlic because we like it. also, right before putting the sandwich halves together we added a leaf of romaine lettuce. very tasty, will make again
