I needed a FAST turkey-n-biscuits recipe, using leftover turkey and canned veggies from the pantry (using up last season's "hurricane stash) and whack-'em-on-the-counter biscuits. I added the herbs and spices to the chicken soup and stirred all together, then poured into a casserole dish sprayed w/ garlic-flavoured cooking spray. I baked @ 400' for 20 min to "hot up" the mixture before adding the biscuits (which I'd cut into quarters), to assure that the biscuit bottoms cooked before they could get soggy; then I baked for another 10 min to brown the biscuits. Easy, inexpensive, great for a crowd -- thanks for the inspiration!

We couldn't believe how good this was, perfect for a busy Fall night. I saw how others ate it in a sitting, so I doubled it. I also boiled one potato al dente and chopped it up to mix in. I used a 9x13 glass pan and spread 2 cans of crescent rolls out flat in a sheet on top. I baked on lower heat (325-350)so they'd cook all the way through. Delicious.

As far as quick, easy recipes go, this one is a winner.  I had a serving, which I thought was great, and then my husband ate the rest.  All in one sitting.

Very nice, basic recipe.  I enjoyed it.  I did use frozen biscuits that I needed to use up (I thawed them, then rolled then thin), and I used cream of celery soup because I thought it would make it more flavorful.  Very good.

This was really fast to put together and didn't take too long in the oven either, so it would be suitable for a weeknight meal. DH didn't like the thyme flavor, so I would skip that if I were to make this one again for him. We really didn't care much for the biscuit topping. It did "pour" just as directed and looked great, but I guess we just prefer a pie crust on our pot pie instead of biscuit style. I doubt I will make this one again, although it was really easy and was very filling. Thanks Dorothy, I enjoyed trying your recipe. :)

Not bad and very easy, perfect for a quick cold weather dinner. My husband and son both love this and can easily eat it all without any help from me so I'll double the recipe next time. I'll also precook the veggies a bit as they were still a little too crunchy.

I didn't use the thyme... not sure if it would have made that much of a difference. But when I cooked the chicken I added most of the seasonings there.. It came out pretty darn good! Probably could have used more salt but I prefer less than more... Thanks!

Pretty good recipe, and real easy!  I did not have any cream of chicken soup, so this is what I did.  I simmered my leftover grilled chicken in some water and chicken bouillion, added frozen mix vegs, then added 1/2 c. milk with about two table spoonfuls of flour and beated egg. Added garlic powder and pepper to tasted and it came out great for a quick lunch!  I also buttered my pan and sprinkled some garlic powder on the bottom.

Wonderful and easy!  I used fresh potato, carrot, celery, onion and garlic - plus frozen peas.  Sauteed in a little butter and white wine, then added some flour, chicken stock and fat-free evaporated milk.  Simmered for awhile, then followed recipe as written.  Simple and lovely!

This delivered on what it was... a quick and easy comfort dish.  I used rotisserie chicken from the grocery store which worked really well.  It was tasty!  Not fantastic and a little salty but will probably make it again.

Both hubby and I loved this, so comforting. I added some grated cheese to the topping and used cream of celery soup, turned out creamy and packed with flavour.  A keeper for sure.

This was great. I stopped short of the biscuit mix because I didn't have time. My men loved it. I too had a small bowl & my DH & 2 grown sons cleaned it out. I think I'll add Jiffy corn bread mix on top the next time I make it.
