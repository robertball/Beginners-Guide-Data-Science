This was easy and quite delicious, as the bruschetta is very flavorful.  No idea what Canadian Parmesan is (the recipe comes from the Dairy Farmers of Canada), so I just used regular Italian parmesan.  I also whisked some grated parmesan into the frittata itself because I thought it might be too plain otherwise.

Easy and yummy. I used parmiggiano reggiano and added some fontina. These were nice for appetizers.  Thanks for the recipe.
