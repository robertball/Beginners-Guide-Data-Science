Delicious!  I added an extra 1/3 cup gruyere cheese to the recipe.  I also made a second batch with shredded beef instead of prosciutto and cooked it for 8 min in a pressure cooker.  Again, it was wonderful!

Delicious! Add a bit of balsamic vinegar on top at the end. Thank you for sharing the recipe.
