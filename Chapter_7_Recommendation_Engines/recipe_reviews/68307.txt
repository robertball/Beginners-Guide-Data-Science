Unusual yet delicious.  Followed the recipie as written.  These had a perfect texture-a delicate crispness outside with a tender inside exactly as both hash & waffles are supposed to be.  On our old wafflemaker (makes *aprox. 4x9" sized* rectangular waffles) it made 3 waffles which is perfect for us.  My DH liked them with maple & Mrs. Butterworth Lite syrups, but he likes sausage w/ syrup, too.  I enjoyed them with just butter & can see adding garlic, thyme, & cayenne or hot sauce to the batter as well.  Wish I would've found this recipie while I was still in my 20s-pair this up with a white or cheese sauce & some eggs sunnyside up & you've got the perfect post-bar breakfast!

My husband and I really enjoyed these and my kids (5 years and 18 months) loved them.  Definitely will make again as an alternative to regular waffles or pancakes.

These were a little bland.  If I make them again I think some black pepper and garlic powder would liven them up quite a bit.

I was searching for recipes for corned beef when I found this one, this was really tasty and different. I used corned beef brisket leftovers instead of canned. Will try again.

Thank you for the recipe. These waffles remind me of the ones my mom used to make for me when I was a child. I am thankful that someone actually had a recipe for these unusual waffles and posted it for everyone. I will make these waffles for my children to keep the tradition of having corned beef waffles for weekend breakfasts going...

Not very good. Made one waffle as written, it tasted mostly like a regular waffle with a mild corned beef hash flavor, with a tough exterior and mushy interior. So I added the remaining 1/2 can of corned beef hash. It got slightly better, but not much.

I thought the waffle recipe itself was very good.  The addition of the corned beef was fair and I decided with the price of corned beef, I'd rather have the corned beef as a main entree. I did keep it as a possible in the event it would spark a guest interest over during St. Patrick's day. I would not use canned corned beef and I would definitely use a fried egg over the top of it as another reviewer suggested. It was the fried egg that made the receipe with the corned beef worthy of keeping.
