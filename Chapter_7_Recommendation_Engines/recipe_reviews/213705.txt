This is a bit like salsa to me.  My family loved it - we are making it for the third time today!  Definitely it is worth the time spent roasting the veggies as Tequila Pro says.  I didn't use the aluminum foil (that didn't work for me), I just used my large cast iron skillet to roast the veggies on my gas stove.  One thing that I wasn't sure about at first was whether to cut the veggies first -- the recipe doesn't say to do it -- I didn't and it worked perfectly.  Yum, yum!

Whoa that's some heat! It was hard to add salt to taste because it was spicy. I made this for my husband; I'm the wuss! I had to alter the serving size in half because it makes enough. I think it needed lime and a bit more garlic.

Quite often I make a similar sauce. My recipe varies depending on what I have on hand. I've roasted serranos, jalepe√±os, and other chilies  on a caste iron skillet, as well as open flame. I've also used tomato paste in lieu of, or in addition to, fresh romas, which are also roasted.  The skin always burns a little, which enhances the flavor of authenticity. 
The only ingredient I add that is not used in  this recipe is fresh cilantro.

I really have to make this one. Suspect that it can be made almost daily!
