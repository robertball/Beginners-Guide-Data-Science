This chowder was GREAT. I made a few changes, but the basic recipe is really yummy. Instead of the half and half cream, I used a can of evaporated skim milk (to kind of cut the fat content). I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs, since that was all I had. Also added some frozen corn with the creamed corn & some cubed potatoes and carrots. The carrots gave it a little color and the potatoes I added because a chowder isn't a chowder unless there's potatoes in it! They also thickened it up a little. Finally, I didn't add the cheese into the soup, I served it as a garnish. Overall, a wonderful, filling and comforting dish.

This is one of my family's favorite soups as well.  I double the recipe and start by making a stock (eliminating the need for boullion) by boiling a whole cut up chicken (bone-in breasts will do as well) in about 4c. water with a couple of tb. salt.  After the stock is done, pick the meat from the skin and bones.  Start the onions and garlic and just throw in the pulled chicken when the the onions and garlic are about half done.  Strain the stock with a colander or like utinsel and add back in a cup instead of the boullion!  I add at least 1 or 2 tb. of salt (by taste while cooking) to make up for what is lost by not using boullion.  I also double the creamed corn.  The soup is thicker, the meat is pulled instead of chunked for a more wonderful texture, and the whole thing has a more homemade feel.  An excellent recipe originally or modified!

This was awesome!!! I used chicken broth instead of the hot water and chicken boullion cube as suggested. I also used diced tomatoes with green chilies and I put in some chopped up canned potatoes. I added a little more hot sauce then suggested. I served it with tostada chips and lots of cilantro. My boyfriend is from mexico and he loved it, he said it was excellent and ate atleast 3 bowls for dinner and had some for breakfast the next morning. This is definitely a keeper. The only thing I would add to it next time is some more hot sauce and and maybe some more chilies.

I'm giving this a 5* rating because I loved the flavor. I added extra cumin, chili powder, cilantro while cooking and two cans of each ingredient instead of one. Also used heavy whipping cream instead of half and half. Let this reduce and it became a nice thick chowder. This is a chowder and not a soup so expect it to be thicker. Also used shredded chedder and monterrey jack cheese instead of just the monterrey jack. Cannot wait for my husband to  try it.

This is my favorite soup all year round!  It has a great flavor that's not too thick, and can be spiced up or left not-so-hot.  I use a large can of chicken broth in place of the water & boullion (by suggestion of my Grandma) and leave the tomatoes out sometimes (depending on who is being served).  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!

I have made this twice in the last week and both times were wonderful! Nice twist and taste! The first time, I followed the recipe almost to the letter (only using canned diced tomatoes-drained-instead of peeling/cutting). The second time, I added a little more chicken, sauted with 1/2c chopped green bell pepper, used a whole can of chicken broth instead of buillon cubes, some whole corn kernals in addition to the creamed corn and a little more cheese. Wonderful. Everyone in my family loves this and I will continue to make this again and again! Thanks so much Jeanne!

Delicious and unbelievably easy!  I made this for my family for Christmas Eve, and it was a big hit.  I used shredded chicken, chicken broth instead of bouillon, omitted the pepper sauce, and added about a cup of frozen corn kernels, and served it with crushed tortillas and chopped cilantro.  I read a lot of reviews that omitted the tomato, but I would say it is necessary for color and a bit of flavor.

This soup is wonderful! A nice hearty soup. Would definitely qualify as comfort food! I added 1 tsp of cumin, 1 tsp of chili powder, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp smoked paprika(the most amazing kiss from God for soup!!! warm and smokey flavor!!!),1 large carrot shredded, 2 potatoes in big chunks and an added can of corn. If you don't like the big chunks of chicken, you can boil your chicken breasts and shred it (when cooled) with your fingers. It gives a much smoother consistancy! On a scale of 1 to 10....my husband gave it an 11!! :)

I have made this chowder several times and my kids especially, love it.  What I do to thicken it up, is add in some corn and flour tortillas. I usually cut up 4-5 smaller corn tortillas in strips and maybe 3-4 flour tortillas, depending upon if you get the big or small ones.  I add in the corn tortillas about 15 minutes before the soup is done, and the flour tortillas about 5 minutes before it is done.  A chef that I knew from Mexico told me about this trick, and it works fantastic for both adding flavor and a creamy consistency to your soup.

I thought this rocked...although I skipped tomatoes but ended up using red peppers with the onions. This added nice color...Also, I added an extra can of corn. I liked it more thick. Also make sure you used good spicy pepper jack. Thanks for the great recipe.

Easy and delicious.  My husband usually hates bonesless, skinless, "tasteless" chicken breast, but he loves this soup!  I added more garlic than called for.

I made this soup for my family the other night and they loved it! I used 2 cans of chicken broth and creamed corn. I also added potatoes, carrots,corn kernels, 1 can fire roasted tomatoes, and chipotle chili powder. My family asked me to make this again tonight. This will be a staple this fall/winter.

This is a really good base recipe to start off with and put your own twist on.  I'm not really sure how to rate this, since it was a good start, but I did change it up a bit to suit my own tastes.
I used oil instead of butter and sauteed the onion and garlic with a diced red bell pepper and jalapeno.  I then added the chicken to brown.  Used stock instead of bouillon, and about double the cumin, as well as adding in some chile pepper and cayenne (I like things spicier).  At this time I also added the creamed corn as well as some frozen whole kernels (per other reviewers suggestions).  I omitted the tomatoes and hot sauce.  I let things simmer for a bit and then added the cream and only about a cup or so of cheese (not a huge cheese fan) but grated more to use as a topping.  Also served with crunched up tortilla chips.  
Wasn't super thick, but had a nice flavor and texture to it.  My significant other REALLY enjoyed it, so thank you for a great recipe base!

An ok recipe, but as others have mentioned, lacking in flavor.  I did use chicken broth rather than bouillon, and my husband mentioned the chicken in and of itself did have a nice flavor.  Thank you for the recipe.

i would give this an OK rating from my family, only because they ate it all up with no complaints, but no one mentioned particularly liking it either.  i added whole kernal corn along with the creamed corn for more substance to fill my guys up.  i also used 2% milk rather than half and half, because i never use that in any recipes when called for, too rich & too pricey. i served the tomatoes & cilantro separate as garnish/toppings. definitely add the cilantro - it makes all the difference in the flavor for this soup!

This is a great base recipe.  I added 1/2 green, red, and orange peppers chopped, some quartered crimini mushrooms, chopped celery, and a couple heaping tablespoons of coriander paste (cilantro).  Terrific flavor, nice heat and satisfying!

I've never reviewed a recipe here before but this was so incredibly good I had to. The only changes I made were to add diced jalapeño, carrots, and diced potato and I used chicken broth instead of the bouillon and water. This so exceeded my expectations. I also made seasoned tortilla strips for garnish. Such a versatile recipe, I can't wait to try it again!

this is pretty good in the original recipe but a few changes make it a lot better. AND A LOT LESS FATTENING. Definitely shred the chicken, i used chicken i had precooked and added after adding the cream and milk no need to saute the chicken. I added half of a red bell pepper and sauteed it with the onion and garlic in ONLY 1TBS OF BUTTER to the butter and onion mix stir in 1tbs of flour. stir in 1 CUP NONFAT MILK and 1 CUP HALF AND HALF till slightly thickened. If you use sharp cheddar you can get away with only using 1 CUP OF CHEESE(mex blend is good too) and sprinkle with cheese when served. And definitely needed more cumin I used 2 tsp. and doubled the garlic. Adding a can of whole corn is good too. leave out the tomato

Yum, yum yum. I loved this. Super easy and even my boyfriend who hates any kind of chowder ate it up. I added some extra cumin, the smoky flavor adds additional depth, and next time will add an extra can of the chilies.

I made some changes based on the ingredients I had on hand, but this is a great recipe base/idea! Terrific dinner on the coldest day of the year. I garnished with cheese and scallions. Yum!

This was ridiculously good!!! My whole family loved it- all 5 of us... In fact my 2 year-old was so busy eating he didn't say a word all meal! I did make a few changes to make it a little more substantial, and, I hope healthy... I used low sodium chicken stock in place of the hot water & boullion, I also upped it to 2 cups. I put in 1 cup half-n-half, 1 cup of skim milk. I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies in it, and added 1.5 cups of frozen corn as well. The biggest change I made was to add a can of garbanzo beans and a can of black beans. (Both were drained and rinsed.) Sadly I didn't have Cilantro- but that would be GREAT! Instead I sprinkled a little CoJack cheese on it and served it with Tortilla Chips for crushing over the top, or my fav- scooping! My husband added more hot pepper sauce, and for the kids I put a dollop of sour cream into theirs. It is rare to find something everyone loves and I can't wait to make it again!!!

Very good....however, as per other reviewers I also changed a few things. I used a can of petite diced tomatoes with jalapeno peppers instead of the fresh tomatoes and chiles and used low fat half and half. I also added 2 small cans of mexican corn which have bell peppers. The chowder was also too thin for my taste so I used a roux of flour, butter and milk to thicken towards the end of cooking.  I like my food a little on the spicier side so I added some extra diced green chiles and red pepper flakes which was the perfect amount of spice.  Overall it was very good and my kids really enjoyed it.  Will be making again in the very near future.

We've enjoyed this several times.  Have cut back on the heat because of our child, but my husband just adds back in when he dishes it up!

this is a good base, however needed some serious spicing up.  the "mexican" flavor was super mild.  if i make it again, i would at least double the cumin, and sub diced jalepenos for the green chiles.  i also chose to use fat free half and half for the cream, which worked out fine for me.

This was great!  I didn't have cream, so I just used milk.  It probably wasn't creamy like it should have been, but still great to me (and less fattening.)  :)  I also used a can of Rotel, a can of black beans, and a can of corn.  And the cilantro is what makes the flavor, in my opinion.  This is definitely a keeper!!

This chowder was delicious.  I did make a few changes because of what I had on hand.  I used evaporated milk instead of the cream and used 1/2 of a 10 oz. can of diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of chopped tomatoes and can of green chiles.  I am sure it is delicious as written also.  I did take another reviewers suggestion of cooking the chicken in water first.  Will be making this again.

This was excellent!  I made the recipe as is although it wasn't thick like a normal chowder.  I added some wonder gravy to the mix at the very end and let it simmer a few minutes longer.  That did the trick!  So easy to make and so tasty!  I will be making this again.

I pretty much followed the recipe, just used turkey breast cutlets instead of chicken (because this is what I had). The whole family ate it - definitely will be making this again only will be doubling the recipe - we are a family of 7 and the guys would have liked to have seconds!

VERY good - a solid 4 stars.  Made exactly as specified except that I added a few heart dashes of Adobo seasoning as everything stewed.  Will definitely be added to the fall/winter soup rotation.

Yummy soup..  Best if you add some chopped cilantro in the chowder instead of just garnishing it ;o)..  For those who had problems with their cheese getting greasy or not melting properly, try either the packs of easy-melt blends (cheese dept) or use Velteeta Mexican Style cheese.   This chowder is AWESOME if you break up tortilla chips on top before serving!

Nice soup.  I had cooked chicken and a lot of corn on the cob leftover after a dinner party last night, so this recipe fit the bill.
I added shredded cooked chicken after sauteing the onion and garlic (in 1 tbsp veg oil, not butter).
I cut the corn off the cobs and then blackened them in a dry cast iron pan, then added them to the soup when the recipe called for them. I also used homemade chicken stock - you really can't beat it for flavour.
I didn't want a really rich, high calorie soup, so I used milk instead of cream, adding a little corn starch to help thicken it.  I also used half the cheese called for.
Next time I make it, I'll use fresh chilies instead of jarred to give the soup a bit more heat.  But otherwise, I can't think of much of anything that I'd change.

I love this recipe except I made a couple changes. Because I live in the Caribbean and don't have access to a Dutch oven I used my crock pot. I sautéed the chicken, onion and garlic in a lot along with 3 finely diced potatoes. At the same time I boiled 2 cups water with a premixed packet of chicken stock ( could substitute with 2 cups chicken broth) cumin and chili powder in the crockpot. When it was boiling I added the sautéed mixture and stirred. After about 5 minutes on warm I added the rest of the ingredients. And wow! Everyone who ate it said it was amazing! And it was easy to keep warm. Served it with crackers. Enjoy!

A very tasty chowder.  I made it a little differently - boiled the chicken in water with cumin and cayenne pepper, then shredded it and added to the other ingredients.  I also added a can of potatoes and a few handfuls of crinkle-cut carrots.  I used fat free half and half and chicken stock instead of the bouillon.  Thanks for the recipe!

We loved this!!  It was quite easy and absolutely delish.  I used 3 chicken breasts, added some frozen corn, used a can of Rotel in place of the fresh tomato and chiles, and we added the hot sauce to our bowls so it wasn't too spicy for my daughter.  It was also awesome with a squeeze of fresh lime.  I think next time I'd even add some diced carrots.  Definitely a new fave! Served with our favorite AR Guacamole recipe and lime tortilla chips.

Wowser, this is outstanding! I made a few minor changes but kept pretty much to the recipe.  Did add some whole frozen corn in addition to the cream-style corn.  Am thinking I'll add some jalapenos next time.  I did add about 1/2 cup picante sauce.   If a recipe calls for bouillon why not use Chicken Base instead?  Much richer flavor. This is quite a dense calorie rich soup.

Pretty good soup.  Like some other reviewers stated, I used a rotisserie chicken, 2 cans cream corn, and rotel.  I didn't put any hot sauce in because my husband hates hot, but now I'm kinda regretting it.  Also like some other reviewers, it was missing a little something.  I don't know if it was the hot sauce or some other spice, but it was lacking "bite."  I would make again.

My family loved this!  I did customize a little based on other reviewers, Rotel instead of chopping up tomatoes and adding chilis separately, a few extra dashes of pepper sauce, chili powder and some red pepper flakes (we like it a bit spicier).  Overall, my husband kept saying this is REALLY good and my eleven year old gave it two thumbs up!  I can't wait to have the leftovers because of all the rave reviews for the day after.  Thanks for the great recipe and ideas!

Made as directed it was very good.  After tasting it though I found it needed a touch more seasoning.

It's a great base recipe thanks for sharing :)

This was OUTSTANDING!  I made this as something I could pop into a pint soup container (from chinese takeout) and take with me to work.   I wanted to hold the pot to my face and drink the whole thing, it was that good!

I did as someone suggested and boiled two bone in chicken breasts and pulled the meat off.  I ended up with a quart of very tasty broth.  I also used fat free evaporated milk in place of the half and half to cut fat.   We regularly have fat free half and half in the house, so I will try that next time.   I also upped the cumin to around 2 tbsp after a taste test...I like strong flavors.

I also added some cubed red skin potatoes because I like potatoes in my chowder.

I liked the shredded cheese melted on top, but my husband preferred it mixed in. :) 

Excellent.

I'm off to buy more ingredient to make it again for this week!  YUM!!

Delicious and easy to make.  I added a little bit of frozen corn and frozen potato cubes to make the soup a bit more hearty.  It had a little kick but was not overly spicy which I appreciated.  I would make again for sure.

My husband and I loved, loved, loved this recipe!  I used a rotisserie chicken (both breasts) and used 8oz chicken broth. I also added about 1 T tomato paste instead of the diced tomatos.  His response, "You should open a soup restaurant staring this soup." ha! Try it! It's SO good.

OMG we had just been to a Mexican Rest. & my husband ordered this.  I'm a soup maker so he requested I find it & I did.  This was awsome.  I made a pot of soup, like I do every week, & this one didn't make it past the first night.  Loved it.  Added a few more drops of hot sauce.  KEEPER

Really good the next day.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Needed something though.  Added pepper and some spicy salt that I had at home.  Also used Bothwell jalapeno jack cheese.  think next time I will spice it up with a jalapeno sauted with the onions.  Also didn't use chicken breast.  Added rotisserie chicken after I melted the cheese.  This recipe is very quick and super easy.  YUM.  Will make this many more times.

This was pretty good and made for great leftovers. I added an additional can of corn and could have added more tomatoes.

Wonderful! Easy, quick and yummy! I used fat free half & half, a can of tomatoes with onions and pepper, doubled the creamed corn on top of a can of mexican corn which means it has red and green peppers in it, i also substituted chicken stock for the hot water and that's it. Family loved it.

I've made this several times now and am always asked for the recipe.  It's very good. I made many of the same changes as other reviewers.  used a rotisserie chicken, heavy cream, rotel tomatoes instead of chilies and fresh tomatoes. I also did not use the cream corn but LOTS of frozen corn, because that's the way we like it.  I also had to thicken it up a bit.  Very worth while recipe!  Thanks Jeanne!

This was very good! I took the advice of others and omitted the tomato&the can of green chiles and substituted it with a can of Rotel.I also put four cloves of garlic in it(we love garlic). I added extra cumin,put some old bay seasoning in it along with some salt & pepper.It made it very flavorful.It didn't have enough flavor before adding the extras.I also used a pre cooked chicken from Walmart to save time.I will make this again.

This is my family's (especially my husband's)favorite recipe from allrecipes.com so far!  I used heavy whipping cream as someone suggested.  I also doubled the corn.  Instead of a fresh tomato, I used a can of peeled diced tomatoes.  Next time I will probably use 2 cans of tomatoes.  I also used unsalted butter when cooking the chicken, onions, and garlic because I had it handy.  I couldn't tell the difference.  Oh yes, I also used a whole red onion (love them!) instead of trying to measure a half cup.  I used Colby-jack instead of Monterey jack and it was incredibly delicious!  Don't miss this one if you love creamy soup!

Just a really great recipe. I scaled serving size to 10 and used boneless skinless chicken thighs that I had instead of breast.  I like to save boneless chicken breasts for other recipes other than soup.  The chicken thighs were seasoned with garlic salt and pepper and browned in a slight bit of olive oil.  The garlic and onions were then sauteed in the drippings from the chicken which then I added 2 tblspns of flour to make a roux. After the above, I followed the rest of the recipe except for... I added 2 cans of creamed corn and 1 can of diced tomatos undrained.  Of course you should adjust seasoning to your personal taste.  Do not just go by the recipe.  We love this one.

A great recipe! I followed some of the suggestions from earlier reviews - I substituted cumin for the oregano and used canned chicken broth in place of water/boullion and whole kernel corn in place of cream-style.  Some had suggested it was a bit thin so I mixed a couple tablespoons flour into the corn liquid to thicken it up a bit.  I used more hot sauce as we like a little kick.  I tasted the soup just before adding the cheese and it was quite rich.  I added some extra milk and skipped the cheese - used it as a garnish.   We thought it was EXCELLENT.  A lot of different suggestions and variations are here, I think the point is that's it's a great recipe which you can easily adjust to your own individual taste.  Have fun!

This soup was a refreshing change from our usual meals.  The contrast of the sweetness of the corn with the spice of the chilies & hot pepper sauce (of which we added extra as we like food to be hot) was great.  I used shredded chicken and used a can of Rotel instead of the seperate chilies/tomato and really liked it.  Also added a can of whole kernel corn as recommeded by other reviewers.  I added chili powder in addition to the cumin and was really happy with it.  Topped the bowl off with some cilantro.  Overall, I think that this recipe, with the adjustments recommended within these review made this a fabulous soup!  It would be a great potluck dish or as a first course to a mexican food dinner party.

Great recipe.  I love it with tortilla chips.  Usually don't have an extra tomato or cilantro around during the winter, but the recipe is great without them too.  I usually add a handful of frozen corn to it too.  I prefer to sprinkle the cheese on top of the bowl rather than mix it in the pot.

This was very good. I sautéed a chopped jalapeño with the onion and garlic. I used 3 C water instead of 1 and 4 bouillon cubes. I added extra cans of creamed corn and green chiles. I used a rotisserie chicken. I added 2 packets of Goya Sazon (magic). Finally I added pepper jack cheese and about 3/4 C heavy cream. Those are my modifications and it was awesome and very easy on a weeknight.

This was AWESOME! I have made many recipes from this website and this by far has gone over the best.  Very addicting and filling!  We have made this for every potluck since first trying it and it goes over BIG!  The only thing I added was some pre-cooked bacon to the mix.  Nice little boost.  Enjoy!

Why did I wait so long to try this recipe? It's delicious, simple, and very easily tweaked. I side with the chowder purists who insist on potatoes (or it isn't chowder), but I diced up some redskins so they added a little color, too. I increased the garlic and cumin to my tastes, and I always use the jarred "Better Than Bullion" paste in lieu of either broth or bullion. This could easily be dressed up for guests, and I am betting that it will make a fabulous leftover - already looking forward to tomorrow's lunch! Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled this recipe. Instead of bouillion cubes and water, I used chicken broth. I did cut the milk by half and used chicken broth. I also used evaporated milk instead of half-n-half. Not a bad soup, it needed a little spicing up before serving it. This was quick to make (less than a half hour including making grilled cheese) and made a filling dinner with the spicy grilled cheese sandwiches.

This soup was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!! Honestly this was restaurant quality soup!!!! I used 5 cups water, with 4 boullion cubes in it first, boiled my chicken breast in that first, with the onion and garlic, and seasoning...then took chicken out to pull apart, added rest of ingredients to stock pot and put chicken back in...i didn't garnish with cilantro because instead of tomatoes, i used ROTEL mexican with lime and cilantro in it!!! This was fabulous and i will make this again and again!!!!
**oh, and instead of half and half (didn't have any) i used a can of evaporated milk! the end :)

I made some slight modifications. I cooked the chicken with the onions and garlic and then shredded it after it was cooked and added it back. I used chicken broth. I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chills. I used heavy cream. I added another can of regular corn. It was good, but I think it needed more flavor. Next time I will shred my own pepper jack cheese the pre-shredded doesn't have the same spicy flavor to me. I will also will add more onion. The dash of hot sauce is a must. Also, if you want the really chowder feel to it you have to let it cook much longer. When we went to clean up after dinner it was so much thicker.

A terrific chowder!  I made this last night for my boyfriend after he came home from a cold, rainy golf day.  It was a perfect cool weather chowder.  I added diced potatoes to give it some more substance, a can of corn and also added carrots for color.  I also cheated and pulled meat from a rotisserie chicken.  I omitted the tomato since I don't love them.  Overall a very hearty chowder and I would highly recommend!

Very good stuff!  But unfortunately on the fattening side.  (And "fat free" half & half sounds like a bit of an oxymoron!) I do not like pieces of chilies or peppers so I cheat with the dry powdered stuff, but since the jar was sitting there I grabbed that when I went for the cumin and it was a bit hotter.  But it was no big deal - I thought this was close to a spice level that I would like so I can just adjust next time and see how I like it.  I also just tossed some tomato on top for garnish and never put it in the soup.  I didn't add any potatoes or anything -- just TRY without them and see what you think.  I do like the idea of using a crock pot and then shredding the chicken - cutting up raw chicken is not my favorite activity.

This was awesome. My boyfriend loved it, took it to work where it got a 5 star rating. Definitely will make this for the family again. Made it a second time but substituted the chicken for crab meat. Turned out pretty good.

I wish I could say that I followed this recipe, but more used it for inspiration for what I had on-hand and it turned out DIVINE (and I have to type it up so that I can refer to it later ;-) YUM. I didn't have half and half, only had regular canned corn, fresh green chiles and no tomatoes.
First, I made a stock using 6 chicken thighs and a bit of salt. I just filled a pan 3/4 of the way with water, put the thighs in, doused in salt, and simmered for about an hour. I put the chicken on a cutting board to cool and poured the stock into a cup 'til I needed it. Then I browned the onion/garlic and put the chicken in when that was almost done. Poured two cups of stock over that, and the cumin. Simmered that for a few minutes, then poured one cup of milk (didn't have half and half, so more stock + some milk). Added everything else (regular corn and no bouillon or tomatoes, as I said before) and simmered for a while. Then I tossed in some cream cheese and used cheddar instead of montey jack, and melted the cheese. It tasted wonderful hot off the stove, but I think it was better after it got cold. Yum.

Wonderful on a cold night!  The changes I made were adding some sliced carrots, potatoes, a little extra garlic, and extra hot sauce. My husband was an instant fan - Will be making this one again!

Simply delicious! The only changes I made to it were to use 1 cup sodium free broth instead of the bouillon cubes/water and add three medium chopped potatoes which I had pre-baked (after all, it is chowder). I also added a can of corn kernels. I have to say that next time I would try to lighten it up by using lower fat monterey jack cheese and evaporated skim milk because, as written, it's definitely not figure friendly soup. Definitely comfort food for those cold winter nights. Yum!

this was very good.  needs tweaking w/spices. very bland as written. upped the cumin and garlic. added chopped cilantro to the soup itself for flavor.  Used fat free half and half and noticed no difference in flavor.  Definitely needs a can of regular corn.  the creamed version gets 'lost' in the soup..only a kernel here and there.  So quick and easy.  very yummy w/tweaking. will definitely make again.  *didn't use bouillon..1 cup canned chicken broth instead.

This turned out great! I didn't have any creamed corn on hand so I used 2 cans of kernel corn with some extra half and half and a touch of sugar. My 8 year old son says "it was one of the best soups ever!" Thanks for the recipes!

This is WONDERFUL! I took this soup to a Crock Pot/Pot Luck at school and it was one of the few soups that was gone at the end of lunch. GONE! I cooked my chicken ahead of time and just dumped everything else in and let it cook on low for about 4 hours. The only additions I made was a can of Rotel and a little bit of chili powder and i used fat free half and half. ****Next time I make this in a slow cooker, I will wait until about 30 minutes before serving to add the cream as it did start seperate a little, but no one seemed to mind:) Don't leave off the fresh tomato and cilantro it adds that little bit of texture to make this soup perfect!

My husband said to repeat this meal!  We used fresh corn, tomatoes, potato and added fresh peppers.  I used fat free half and half and my husband thought it was still very creamy (he is picky about fat free). Love it!

Wow! This recipe was amazing! I made a few slight changes to adjust to my family's tastes as well as a reduction in calories. I doubled the recipe but cut the butter content in half and substituted olive oil. I also used chicken broth instead of bouillon because most of bouillons contain MSG. I also added a 1/4 t. of cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce while the chicken was cooking. In addition, I reduced the amount of half and half and used whole milk in it's placed. I felt mine needed to thicken a little so I added a touch of corn starch. And the biggest change of all was my BIGGEST recommendation which is SKIP the canned cream-style corn and make your own. It is so easy! I used the "Brookview Hotel Cream-style Corn" recipe from here. My very picky daughter kept telling me how sweet and spicy it was; that it was delicious and my hubby went back for thirds!!! Great recipe, thanks!

Great flavorful soup!  I used whole milk in place of the cream and regular low-sodium corn because I didn't have any creamed corn, and this turned out great.  I also used Pepper Jack cheese which added a little extra kick.

We've had this multiple times now and are still in love with it. Unlike many other soups, this one has tons of flavor. We've made it exactly as the recipes states, as well as mixing it up. Either way, well worth it!

EXCELLENT! THE ONLY CHANGE I MADE WAS USING HALF THE CHEESE. IT JUST LOOKED LIKE TOO MUCH.  IT TURNED OUT TO BE A GOOD CHOICE.  COULDN'T FIND JACK CHEESE SO I USED A BAG OF COLBY/JACK.  IT'S A KEEPER!

This soup was delicious!  I had to make substitutions as I didn't want to go to the store for the few things I didn't have.  I used half 1/2 and 1/2 and half sour cream.  I also added a can of black beans.  My girls, who tend to be picky, loved it!  Thank you so much for sharing.  This will be a recipe that I will make on a regular basis!

Had this for supper tonight. Was very good.  The only thing I did differently is to add a can of mexican style corn along with the creamed corn and I used about a cup of canned diced tomatoes instead of the fresh tomato. (because I have them leftover in the fridge) Was quick and delicious.

This is a DELICIOUS soup! I've made it twice. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly, and it was great. The second time I fried about 6 slices of chopped bacon, then sauteed the onions and garlic in a bit of the bacon fat. I omitted the chicken, used one can of chicken broth in place of the water/bouillon, increased the cumin to 1 tsp, used 2 cans of creamed corn and used pepper jack cheese in place of monterey jack. I still added the cream, green chilis and also added a dash of crushed red pepper. This version was outstanding. Next time I will also add a bit of shrimp. Definitely a keeper!!

This was a great soup to make on a cold rainy day.  I loved all the flavor and the thickness.  I used tortilla chips to scoop it out...delicious.  Even better a few days later.

The soup was delicious! My mom and I loved it! The half and half gives it a nice creamy texture. The soup is just as good re-heated and may be slightly spicier. I followed the recipe as directed with the exception of omitting the onion.

I made this exactly as written except that I used two cans of cream style corn. I think this was a mistake and made this more of a soup then a chowder. Next time I think I'd use one can of cream corn and one can regular corn, to make it more like a thick chowder. I also think I will shred the chicken next time. However, the flavor was good. My boyfriend liked the way this turned out more than I did.

I love this recipe!! I have made it a lot this winter. I do have a few changes. I tried this first with half and half as the recipe calls for, but now I use fat free half and half. I can't taste the difference. I also put 3 frozen chicken breasts in a crockpot with about a cup of water & cook on low for 4 hours. I then shred & add to the recipe. I also add an extra can of creamed corn, & substitute a can of rotel for the tomato & green chilis. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I used milk instead of cream, and I boiled 2 chicken breasts and shredded them instead of diced.  I added tones of cilantro to serve.  I added twice the cumin and some chili powder.

This was very yummy.  I put it ALL in the crockpot on low for 6 hours which I wouldn't do again--it made the cream and the cheese do something odd.  But that was my fault!  Tasted great though, and I'd happily go the crockpot route again and stir in the cheese and the cream before serving.  Great flavor!

We loved this soup!!!! It was delicious, although I did make some changes per other reviews. I used 1 cp of chicken broth instead of the hot water and boullion cubes, I added a cup and a half of frozen corn, I added a can of white potatoes (cubed),  I added canned tomatoes, finally I added a couple dashes of hot sauce and pepper. I thoroughly enjoyed this chowder and so did my husband! This will be made again!!!

Very good!!  Just finished making this.  I wish I had used less than 1/2 of one packet of chicken bouillon seasoning, it came out a bit salty.  I also used heavy cream, a can of tomatoes with green chilies, 2 small stalks of celery, frozen corn instead of cream corn, 2 slices of American cheese sandwich slices, and two small diced up potatoes.  A very tasty recipe, and a very forgiving one if you do not have all or the exact ingredients.  Next time, I will use less chicken bouillon.  If you have small kiddies, test the spicey-ness before throwing items in  i.e. hot pepper sauce, green chilies, etc!!  Recommend!!

Awesome!!  I used stock made from leftover rotisserie chicken, picked the meat off of the bones, set aside.  Then I cooked diced onion in some butter until translucent, added garlic, and 2 tablespoons flour to make a roux.  I added my chicken stock and cumin, and brought it to a boil and simmered some water off of the stock.  Then I added a can of creamed corn, corn from 2 leftover ears of corn on the cob, and the chicken and cumin.  I did not add cream, tomato or hot sauce.  Instead I put in nearly 8 oz of pepper jack cheese at the end, and stirred until melted.  Yum!  I did not need to add any boullion or additional salt, either.  Very yummy for a cool fall day!  thank you for this recipe.

Pretty darn good on a cool rainy evening.  I always use soup as an opportunity to infuse more vegetables into my family's diet, so I added diced carrots & potatoes.  Instead of using green chilies and diced tomato, I used a can of Rotel which had them both already combined.  Fat free half and half makes this soup more healthy and low fat cheese reduces the fat grams even more.  I used a combination of creamed corn and whole kernel corn for more texture.  Reheats very well and is even more delicious the second or third day!

My family and I loved this tasty bowl of goodness! Quick, easy and filling.  Great comfort food. The only change I made was adding an extra can of creamed corn.

I propose the name of this soup be changed to "miracle soup from god."  Instead of monterey jack I used pepperjack and added an extra can of corn.  this is the best soup I have ever tasted and corn chowder is my favorite soup.  This is now my number one favorite recipe that I will share with as many people that will listen

Me and My family love this recipe. I've been making this for a few years now, and I have never managed to screw it up even when I played with the recipe. Here are a few modifications I have made: I changed the cheese to one cup mild or medium cheddar, and one cup pepper jack cheese. It makes it a little more rich, and adds a little spice. To make it simpler I sometimes use canned tomatoes.

A really good basic chowder, but just a shade under perfect--hence the 4 stars.  I've made it twice now, and had to adjust twice.  I'm not a fan of bouillon cubes as they taste rather manufactured.  So I used chicken broth (packaged is fine) instead--2 cups.  I also upped the garlic to about 4 minced cloves.  I browned the chicken and then set it aside to add later so it wouldn't overcook.  Substituted 4 scraped ears of fresh corn (cuisine arted the corn to a cream). Doubled the onion, 1 tsp. cumin plus some about a tsp. dried oregano.  Used cream, added at the end.  Put the grated jack into the soup at the last and used liberal chopped cilantro, fresh chopped oregano, and minced green onions to garnish.  It was outstanding!. Even a friend, who is Mexican, gave it 5 stars. Served it with chips and salsa; and a cheese/jalepeno bread.  The gang went wild!

Loved this and sooooo easy!!  I did a few things different, they are as follows:  Didn't use any chicken, used Fat Free Half & Half, used low-sodium chicken broth instead of water & bouillon and used some Fire Roasted Tomatoes w/garlic (drained), didn't use onion..I used "Onion Salt" instead, I also used about 1 cup of cheddar cheese instead of Monterey Jack since that is what I had on hand....with all that being said, this was superb and I will make this again, and my husband really loved it :-)

I give it a four because I had to tweak it by adding cayenne pepper to give it some zing.  Also, if you like thicker soups, add potatos or corn starch because its pretty thin.

I took it to a potluck, everybody wanted the recipe, used cilantro as garnish as suggested, also tortilla strips on top as desired.  Will make again, in fact, for company this weekend! Thanks!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  Kind of combined a few of the reviewer's notes along with the posted recipe to create my own version.  I used the Chicken Broth, and Heavy whipping cream, added diced red and green Bell Peppers and just small amount of diced jalapenos, and a can of drained whole kernal corn.  Then I increased the amount of cheese to 2 cups each of Pepper Jack and Sharp Cheddar.  Worked really well, reheated perfectly.

This chowder is truly delicious!

For my variations on it, I skip the hot sauce and saute a couple minced Thai chilis with the chicken, onion and garlic (red chilis work well also).  If that isn't spicy enough, you can also add a few sprinkles of cayenne pepper at the end. 

I use 2% milk instead of the half and half (though it does thin the consistency a bit) and the last 5 minutes of cooking I add 3-4 cups of baby spinach.  I know it looks like it will be too much and it will make the soup awkward to eat, but trust me, once the leaves wilt, the amount will be perfect. Spinach revs up this recipe's nutritional content without altering the flavor, and the leaves turn a lovely bright green that really adds character!

This was very tasty!!  I added some finely chopped celery, carrots & green peppers in when adding the onions, and replaced the greens chilis & hot sauce with 2 chilis with adobo sauce.  That gave it a smoky, spicy flavor.  I also used chicken stock instead of the water/bouillon mix and used 2 cups of stock instead of 1.  It had a great consistency and our company raved about it.  Even better, it reheated great for lunch. I'll definately make this again!

Super yum! I used 2 cans fat free evaporated milk instead of the cream. It would have been good to add an extra can of creamed corn or even regular corn. My kids said "more tomatoes!". Red bell pepper would be good as well. Oh, and I used cheese as a garnish.

The broth was DELICIOUS, but overall the soup was way too watery and would have needed major overhaul, doubling or even tripling the corn, more chicken, maybe some peppers, or something to make it heartier.

This was very good, but I changed a few things according to the suggestions of other reviewers.  I added a small can of mexican corn (w/bell peppers)and I used a can of mild diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of the fresh tomato and can of green chiles.  I also omitted the hot sauce because my husband doesn't like hot and the chiles already give it enough kick.  I put it all in a crock pot and let it cook on low for several hours.  It turned out excellent!

I'll give this one 3 stars because half the family liked it while the other half didn't.  It tasted really sweet to me.  I'm assuming because of the creamed corn.  I had a ton of rice left from another recipe that we didn't care for, so I added it to the chowder to make it a little thicker.  That helped some.  If I make again, I think I'll just use regular corn.

This was fantastic! I had rotisserie chicken (the kind you buy at the grocery store) leftover from the night before and used it in this. I don't know if I'll try it any other way now. Because we are native New Mexicans, I have my freezer full of fresh roasted green chile, so I used a bag of that - it was about a cup of green chile chopped - way more than the recipe calls for. I also used a little more garlic, and a can of Rotel chopped tomatoes and green chiles and as other reviewers suggested, I added an additional can of regular (not cream-style) corn. The heat was just about right for us, but we are both huge chile lovers, so adjust according to your own tastes. I served it with a crisp green salad and some crusty french bread. Next time I make this, I will double everything - we had almost no leftovers!

We thought this was pretty good but nothing to write home about.  I put everything except the cream and cheese in my slow cooker and let it cook all day to shred the chicken.  I used frozen corn because I didn't want any sweet taste from the cream-style.  I also used 1 large onion, 1 teaspoon of cumin, more butter, more green chilies, and a can of Rotel instead of the chopped tomato, then thickened by whisking a couple of tablespoons of cornstarch to the cream.  After it began to thicken, I added the cheese to melt, stirred and cut the slow cooker off.  I served it with flour tortillas.  I think the key to making this chowder is to cook the chicken until it shreds on its own.

Yummy!!!  The whole family loved it, even the picky eaters.  I added a few aromatics (carrot, celery, and potatoes).  Also, I only used 1 1/3 cup of half and half, I added a little at a time, until I thought it had a nice chowder color and texture.

This recipe was the BOMB!!!  My whole family loved it!  I did make a few changes to satisfy our taste.  I used an extra can of cream corn to thicken it up.  I used 1 tablespoon minced garlic and I used pepper cheese (monterey jack) instead of regular!  Also, if ya want it a bit more spicy, use a can of Rotel instead of chopped tomatoes!

Great tasting soup!  I had to substitute a few things for what I had on hand: 1 can evaporated milk + 1 c. whipping cream; 1/2 c. med salsa for tomato; 1 can of chicken broth + 1 chicken bouillon cube. I also thickened it with 2 T. cornstarch in a little water. I served it topped with crushed tortilla chips and a dab of sour cream.

This soup is good and filling.  I used chicken broth instead of cubes and salsa instead of chillies and fresh tomatoe.

I love this soup. I did substitute condensed milk for half and half for lower fat. You could also use low fat cheese. I also use Rotel instead of the peppers and tomatoes. Either way, it is delicious. Don't leave out the cumin because it's the best part. Remember to double the recipe for hungry folks or more than 4 that want seconds!!

Every time I serve this soup, my guests go crazy!  It has such a great flavor, especially for those of us who love spicy food.  I change the recipe a little with more cumin, and instead of using mont. jack cheese and canned jalapenos, I use pepperjack cheese in the amount called for.  It gives the soup a great kick!  This is definitely a soup you would expect to have in a great restaurant.

Great chowder w/ a little tweeking.  Add a little salt and white pepper, extra whole kernal corn (about 1/2 C.). Cook and then shred the chicken rather than bites.  Serve w/ crushed tortilla chips on top.  Excellent for autumn days!

This was so easy to throw together and everyone LOVED it. I basically followed the recipe except for the bouillon I didn't have any so I used chicken broth instead. The flavor was great. This one gets marked as a favorite to make again and again.

Very scrumptious!! I followed the recipe but I think next time I'll use shredded chicken, more peppers, hot sauce, and dash in a little pepper at the end.

Very good! I used my crock pot and just put in frozen chicken breast with the water, garlic, butter, bouillon, chiles, onions, and cumin. Once cooked I shredded the chicken and added the remaining ingredients. Followed the recipe except didn't add the hot sauce, used a bag of frozen corn instead of creamed and added a can of roasted tomatoes.  Garnished with lots for cilantro.

I tend to stay away from soup-like-recipes because they intimidate me (for whatever irrational reason!), but this one was very easy to prepare and turned out great!  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts (my husband prefers dark meat), and fresh rather than canned chili peppers.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and I absolutely loved it.  Thanks for posting!

This is a perfect recipe for a cold day enjoyed by a fire. Instead of chicken breasts I used chicken thighs (the dark meat has much more flavor). I boiled the thighs in water with a sprinkle of seasoned salt, garlic powder, and paprika. I also added potatoes and 1 can of regular sweet corn with the creamed. I only added half the cheese at the end so you could add your own when served. Really easy, really filling.

Awesome recipe!  My husband definitely liked the flavors and requests this soup often.  Used boneless skinless thighs instead of breasts.  We tried it with half and half, but prefer to add no milk.  It's a chunky, hearty soup when you leave out the milk.

This was a good base.  First time I made recipe to exact.  It was... underwhelming.  Second time I modified it and it wasn't bad at all.  I used 2/3 a can of rotel instead of the tomatoes and chilies.  I omitted the hot sauce.  I added some small diced potatoes and carrots along with some whole kernel corn. I added more cumin, some rosemary, and lime juice. Shredded the chicken and used stock instead of bullion.  Made a roux to thicken it more and cut way back on the cream added. Even added some more fresh tomatoes that I needed to use up and served cheese on top vs in it.  My husband loved it this time.  Only thing I wish I had at that time were some flour tortillas I could have popped into the oven for a wonderful crunchy garnish!  My daughter raved about the "broth" of the soup.  I'm not saying the orig recipe was bad just that it doesn't deserve a 5 star in my book. After the changes it's going into my "It's cold and I want soup!" rotation.

This was alright. While I liked this, I'm not sure I'd want to make this again. As is, this is a very "soupy" chowder. I like my chowder thick, but that's an easy fix and is by no means a deal breaker for me. What I didn't like about this was how mild this was. This could use quite a bit of spice, IMHO. In an attempt to remedy both the texture and up the flavor factor, I made a few changes. I added an additional can of (Mexi-blend) corn for added bulk and subbed a shredded rotisserie chicken in lieu of cubed chicken (personal preference). My biggest change was to omit the fresh tomato and canned chiles in favor of a small container of fresh pico de gallo. I absolutely LOOOVED the zip that the pico added, but even with this change, I just wasn't wowed. :( Plain and simple, this just needs too much tweaking to suit my tastes. Thanks anyways, Jeanne.

Quite tasty - added the chipotle powder that another reviewer suggested and extra hot pepper sauce 'cause we like it hot and spicy. Chowders are really not supposed to be thick - I added plain milk instead of the heavy cream and added corn niblets. My family really enjoyed it. As always, thanks for sharing.

Made the recipe according to the directions and the taste was outstanding. All I would add for MY family is shredded habanero cheese which is now available to give it more heat.

My first time making a corn chowder turned out pretty good.  I used chicken broth instead of bouillon (which makes a big diff), I couldn't monterey jack cheese so I used pepper jack and one can of cream and regular corn and it was delish!  I only had one bowl, my husband had too and burnt the whole pot reheating it! I was disappointed but I'm excited to make it again so I can work on enhancing the flavor!

Great recipe however it was a tad bit thin, so I added about 1 tsp of corn starch and brought it to a boil which helped thicken it just a little to make it that perfect thickness. Loved this recipe and so did everyone in my house! also, hot water from he tap didn't dissolve the bullion cubes! Had to use boiling water to do so.. Still loved it though!

Great base recipe. It really needed punched it up because it was was too bland for our taste. I added a small can of diced jalapenos, much more cumin, chili powder and I chopped up some red bell pepper. Added a can of corn and a can of chicken broth in place of boullion as others suggested as well. The result was fantastic. Will definitely make again with the changes.

This is AMAZING but mostly as a base before making your own changes, as I made huge changes and everybody loved it! I add more garlic, evaporated milk instead of half and half, old cheddar instead of Monterey Jack, a can of sweet kernel corn [in addition to the creamed corn], kidney beans, chopped potatoes, a little bit of either taco or chili seasoning, and both salsa and taco sauce to give it that kick! It is super hearty and delicious :)

I made this recipe for a house warming party last night and it was a hit.  I made some alterations that made it easier I believe.  I boiled the chicken along with some garlic.  I than used the broth from the chicken and kind of followed the rest of the recipe to the T.  Love it!!

We love this chowder! I have to leave the onion out, but only because it doesn't agree with my husband. I sometimes add an extra can of cream-style corn, but it is perfect as is!

This recipe is delicious! I basically followed it exactly, only I did not have a whole fresh tomato, so I took whole canned tomatoes (4 of them because they were small tomatoes) and tore them into small pieces. I also only had cheddar cheese, so that is what I used instead, and I did not have half and half, so I made my own using half skim milk and half heavy whipping cream. I also used 1 cup or chicken broth instead of bouillon cubes. Turned out so good, my husband and I loved it!

Good base recipe, but as is there's something lacking. I added 2 tsp. chili powder and an extra can of green chilies as well as a can of niblets and a cup of frozen corn. My kids actually liked this! They don't like much of anything...... Next time I will add diced carrots too.

Just got through fixing this and it was wonderful!!! I did use a readers suggestion and add a can of rotel to this instead of the chopped tomato.  Simply wonderful for a cool winter evening!

AWESOME! Great flavor. I didn't have Montery Jack cheese so I used co-jack. Try adding potatoes or hash browns and carrots.

So. Good! Made it last night and have had it for lunch today :)  Made it a tad differently - used chicken thighs, 2 cans of creamed corn, 1 can regular sweet corn, 1 tsp cumin... will definitely be making it from now on :)

This soup is DELISH!!! (Yes, it deserves all caps).  Everyone went back to the pot looking for more, but my family of 5 finished it off in 1 serving.  I have some already cooked chicken in the fridge and may have to make this again tomorrow.  This was easy and awesome!

It's delicious, however I think it needs some fresh jalepeno or maybe serrano pepper to balance out the sweeteness of the corn. But even still, it was absolutely wonderful!

We love this soup, and so will your guests. For best results, add the cheese about 15min before serving. Garnish with the tomato and cilantro upon serving. At our house, the cilantro is a must with this recipe!

It's good with a few black beans added, and I used fresh tomatoes. Other than that, I followed the recipe. Pretty darn good. Next time I will shred my chicken for a better consistency.

As written, I did not find this recipe to be all that great. If you notice, almost everyone made changes to it! But it is a great list of ingredients! Also, the serving size is very off. There is no way that 8 people could eat the amount this recipe makes, it is probably more like 3.

This was REALLY good. I left out the hot pepper sauce so my daughter could enjoy, added an extra can of cream corn and added ~3 Tbs of salsa fresca in place of the tomatoes. My husband would not eat this because of the half and half and his cholesterol so I will try substituting low fat evaporated milk and/or silken tofu (from another recipe I saw) next time. This was so good, I have to admit that I totally didn't mind having this chowder all to myself!

This was great!  I mostly followed the recipe but I added and extra can of Mexican corn, didn't add the hot pepper sauce (probably could have used it) and didn't use any cilantro b'c I didn't have any (again, probably would have been a good addition).  Even without the cilantro and hot sauce, it was very tasty!  Oh, I cooked the chicken and shredded it instead of making bite size pieces.  Took little longer but I think it's worth the extra effort.

I thought this was delicious! I had to emprovise a bit with the ingredients I had on hand, but I would DEFINITELY make it again. The only changes I made were 1. I used a crock pot and cooked everything but the cheese and cream for about 6 hours on low. 2. Instead of green chilis, I just used about 1/2 a jar of green salsa, and 3. I added an extra bag of corn. Once we were within 30 minutes of wanting to eat, I added the cheese and cream-- it was a little more runny than I would prefer, so next time I may try to thicken. Great snowy day treat!

My family loves this chowder. I changed/tweaked a few things:  Instead of chicken boullion cubes, I used Better Than Boullion.  It is a soup paste/base and is great.  Substituted Rotel tomatoes for the green chiles and used cheddar cheese instead of Monterey Jack.   Finally, instead of cream style corn - I used Campbell's Corn Chowder and added some frozen corn.    I love to make this in the winter.  It doesn't last long!

I thought this was a good soup but a little sweeter than I expected, probably from the creamed corn, maybe next time I will use regular corn?

Great flavor. I did shred chicken and use broth/salt instead of boullion. I also added a few TBS. of flour as a thickener to make it more like a chowder and less like a cream soup. We also like cilantro a lot so I would recommend using it liberally as a garnish or just having a bowl of it at the table for people to add to taste.

I used my own homemade chicken stock instead of bouillon, and roasted poblano peppers in place of the canned green chiles.  Much better recipe this way, although I appreciate the launching point this recipe provided.

Very flavorful, but not spicy, restuarant-quality soup! I tried to follow the recipe, but made some substitutions based on what I had at home and what looked good at the market. I used boneless skinless thighs, chicken stock and chihuahua cheese. I will definitely make this again!

I added a can of mexi corn and shredded the chicken. I also subbed half and half for heavy cream since that's what I had on hand and I wanted to get rid of it. The chowder tasted pretty good, but it didn't seem very healthy, despite all the veggies I put in there. I also had to add quite a bit of hot sauce to give it some kick. Overall, it was decent. I probably won't make it again anytime soon, though.

Oh so yummy!! The changes I made were: cooking spray instead of butter, Fat Free Evaporated Milk for the half & half, diced jalapeno instead of hot sauce, chicken broth for the water/cube mix, added green peppers, diced carrots, a can of regular corn and an extra clove of garlic. It is super yummy!!!

Good soup.  We really enjoyed this but I added more hot pepper sauce for a bit more heat.  I also used 3 cloves of garlic.  Will make this again.

I love this recipe! The only change I make is adding canned tomatoes with green chilis rather than fresh tomatoes, just a personal preference.

This soup is amazing!  Definitely a crowd-pleaser and great for a quick-fix comfort food.  Recipe is fantastic as-is, but I also add a small-diced potato, for texture.  Serve with hot sauce and tortilla chips!

This soup is excellent! I didn't have the chicken boulion, so I used chicken stock. I also didn't have any half and half, so I used two cups milk instead. I loved this recipie however my husband said it was only o.k. (he doesn't care for Mexican food)I really wish he liked it so I could make it again for us for dinner

This was SO good! Easy and very satisfying. Made it lower fat by using pan spray rather than oil, 2% milk rather than cream, and 1 cup of cheese rather than 2. I also added a can of corn nibblets. Next time I might add shrimp instead of chicken.

This was really good.  I used my crockpot to simmer the chicken breasts for a few hrs in the bouillion/cumin/garlic mix to eliminate the sauteing in butter step, which saved a few calories and effort.  I used whole milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2.  Skipped the cheddar, but put a dollop of sr cream on top which was pretty tasty.

OMG!!!!! This is without a doubt, the best tasting chowder recipe I have ever tried. I  used Tapatio hot sauce and doubled the amount. It gives it heat, but you can't stop eating it! I also used heavy whipping cream. I got the idea from another reviewer. Thickens up nicely, but isn't as rich as you would think. This is a new family favorite and will make it over and over again. This would make a perfect tailgate party snack, or for any cold day.

Although I am now a vegetarian-this was by far my favorite recipe when I ate meat-and I will probably modify it without the chicken.  My family still begs me to make this one though & I do :o)

I must have made this one over 40 times!  Here are my time saving tricks.  Use one large and one smaller can of chicken breasts-drained.  I used canned chicken broth instead of the bouillon water because it just tastes better.  If you are watching your waistline a little...you can use evaporated milk or 2% milk instead of the half and half but it does make it a little bit runnier. I used much more than a dash of hot sauce...much! LOL  I serve this with fresh italian bread.

Out of this world delicious.  I have been asked for this recipe several times and it's a new favorite on our table.  If you don't have cream style canned corn or have an issue with it you can take a regular can of corn and put it in the food processor and grind it up with about half the juice from the can and it works very well.

My husband made this soup last night and it was very good and hardy.  He kicked-up the hot sauce ingredient a few notches making it just right on the level of spice, but it could of used more corn.  We will definitely be saving this to our 'Recipe Box'.

Good. Serve with corn bread to dip it in. I would thicken it and add something else- corn or maye small cut potatoes. I added more green chilis and didn't add the tomato.

This recipe is great!  Made it yesterday for our super bowl party and everyone loved it.  I added some rice, used extra liquid and just did chunk corn.  I added a little extra spice, but went easy for my guests.  I will add a lot of spice to the leftovers!!

This was good. The cream seemed to make it a little heavier than I usually like in a soup. I did however add more cumin, garlic, chili powder, and some cayenne to suit our taste.

Probably the best soup/chowder I've ever had.  We like things spicy so I added about 2 T of red pepper and 1/2 c salsa.  We also added 2 tomatoes, 2 red potatoes sliced thin, and 1/2 c chopped cilantro since we like a chunkier chowder.

Used extra cheese, add crumbled bits of spicy sausage.  Allow time to simmer, and really thicken up.  Served with jalepeno corn muffins.

Awesome and yummy!  I pretty much doubled everything and used canned chili-ready tomatoes instead of fresh. I also added 2 drained cans of black beans. I used 2 cans of diced green chiles and cooked those with the chicken.  Great dish - we added a dollop of sour cream and crushed corn chips to each bowl of chowder - really good stuff!  My whole family had seconds.  :)

Awesome.  My boyfriend & I made this together & LOVED IT.  We added a few things to suit our fancy... jalepenos & potatoes & it worked like magic.  Can't wait to try it on my parents... My mom's going to think Betty Crocker's got nothing on me!

I love this recipe!  I make it without the chicken (trying to become a vegetarian household) and it is a staple for us.  It is a great recipe as is and it's also fun to play around with some substitutions too.  I sometimes use salsa in the place of the tomato and chili's and that is good too.  I also use much less cheese than is called for, but that's a personal preference.

I thought this was fantastic.  Based on what others said I used some milk instead of all the cream and I also used a can of regular corn to get more texture.  I ate this for a week and enjoyed it everyday.  Will definitely make this again!

Very very good and was even better the next day. I added an additional can of creamed corn and think next time I make it I will add some black beans as well. Overall very yummy!

it tasted just okay for me- I added yukon gold potatoes as suggested by another user and also added another can of cream corn and two cans of regular corn.  I also added a can of cream of chicken soup to add some thickness to it.  After dinner, I put the rest of the chowder in the refrigerator and it was 10 times better the next day reheated for lunch!

We really liked this.  It was easy to make and tasted very good.  I added more hot sauce because we like things with more of a bite.  Also, will try using milk next time to lighten it up a bit.

I found this recipe 18 months ago and it is still a hit!  I use skim milk and a little cornstarch instead of half-and-half and vary the cheese based on what I have on hand but it always comes out great. I have to tone down the spices for my kids' sake but always add an extra shot of hot sauce to my own bowl.  A definite keeper!

This turned out really nice. I used light evaporated milk instead, but may use skim milk next time. I added some salt and pepper cause it just didn't seem salty enough.
Very good and quick meal.
thanks!

This is DELICIOUS! I used fat free half-and-half, added Wehani rice (found in health food stores)thickened it a little with cornstarch, used the Rotel tomatoes, and used frozen corn instead of cream style. I also added more corn than the recipe calls for. This is a definite keeper!

Very good! I did change it a little, I didn't have cumin so I used chili powder, and I didn't have half and half so I used milk. Still turned out fantastic. My family does not care for cooked tomatoes, so served the soup garnished with salsa and sour cream. Will definitely be making this again! I just need to buy some cumin first :)

I make this same recipe but I add two diced yukon gold potatoes and in place of the bullion and water I use homemade chicken stock from roasted chicken for a much lower sodium level, and fat free half and half. I also put a small handful of rough chopped cilantro and 1/4 tsp ground red peppers for som heat.

delicious! I cooked the soup a little longer after adding the half and half and that really thickened it up. It turned out great and is just as good reheated.

This was good... but I made a few changes.  I cup up some celery and carrots in small cubes and cooked with the chicken.  I also added one green onion (with top).  Also, I put 2 cans of creamed corn instead of 1/2 of one.

Awesome!  Doubled the recipe; only had 1 can of chiles and it was good, but a little more heat would be nice, so next time will use the full amount.  Used 2C of chicken borth and 1 boullion cube for the liquid.  Added 1C frozen corn and let simmer before adding the cream.  Great with some crushed tortilla chips on top.  Wonderful soup.

I enjoyed this recipe as written, but felt that it needed a little something more. I like to make all recipes as written first, then modify subsequent preparations of it. I find that, as others suggested, adding a can of corn kernels makes a heartier dish. As for spices, I now use 3-4 cloves of garlic, up the cumin to 1 teaspoon, use about 3/4 teaspoon of hot sauce, and of course salt and pepper to taste, all the rest is as written in the original. Since this is a rather rich dish as written, I sometimes lighten it up by using lowfat milk and lowfat cheese and just let it cook until its as thick as I want. I've even tried this recipe in the crockpot with success. Thanks for a nice comforting recipe.

I thought it was good.  I added two tablespoons of flour to make it a little thicker, but next time some potatoes are needed needed. I think it would be better with some pepper and cajun seasonings!

Made this last night. It was great (not as thick as I would have liked. Made the following changes. Some at other's suggestions:
-used a can of rotel instead of tomato and green chiles
-added a can of regular corn
-used an already made rotissere chicken from grocery store
-didn't have any cumin so didn't use it
-used Louisiana hot sauce 
-used 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1
Will definitely make again.

I thought this recipe was great!!  I did change a few things (used evaporated milk, more corn, spicy diced tomatoes).  It was great this way, so I'm sure the original recipe is even better!!!

delish!  I made this exactly as recipe the first time and everyone loved it-I have since made it with turkey breast and omitted the hot sauce but used pepperjack and added peas and an extra can of corn(not cream style).  I have taken it to two pot lucks with fantastic results.

This was very good, I'll make it again. I added rice to soak up some liquid and make it thicker. It needs a little something more, maybe some more spice? Scallions on top would also be good, or maybe pico de gallo. All in all, very tasty and hearty meal for the winter!

We substituted about 4 tablesoons of sweet condensed milk and then the rest of the half and half. Also, added some cayenne pepper to spice it up.  It had a sweet, hot flavor. yum! The leftovers were even better.

Love it! Have made this several times and my picky 8 year old daughter jumps for joy when she hears that this soup is what's for dinner. I use chicken thighs instead of breasts. A much better flavor and texture for our family. Yum. Thanks for the recipe!

Made again today so I'm updating my review!  This is an awesome recipe base to use.  I tweak in the following ways: make home-made chicken (or turkey) stock, shred the poultry, use 4 cups stock, 4 cups half & half, 2 tsp cumin, 2 tsp hot sauce, 1 diced tomato, 1 can creamed corn, 1 can kernel corn drained, 1 can green chilis, ceyenne pepper to taste, salt and black pepper, 1 bag shredded colby jack cheese.  This makes a lot of soup but is even better the next day.  I also add a handful of fresh cilantro to the soup while cooking.  Very tasty!!!

Fabulous'  Tweaked the recipe a bit as we like food with a bit more zip and zing. Added three cloves of garlic, not just one.  Also sprinkled red pepper flakes on chicken as it was cooking in the butter.  Used one can of corn, one small bag of frozen corn - no creamed corn at all.  Added one tablespoon red pepper paste (like the kind they have in Chinese restaurants) instead of Tabasco.  One mistake -- mine -- was to add dried cilantro.  Floated around the chowder in kind of an unattractive presentation, but did not have fresh cilantro.  All in all, fantastic and easy to do. Great soup for a cold winter day.

Great recipe!  I changed a few things... 3 cubes of chicken bouillon, 2 cups of water, fat free half & half, half frozen corn, half cream-sytle corn, and a can of rotel instead of a tomato.  I forgot to add the diced green chiles, but it still has a great flavor!  I also boiled my chicken then shredded it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Good recipe!  I added more regular corn and hominy, I also cooked the cilantro in the soup and used skim evaporated milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2.  Crushed tortilla chips on top made it more kid-friendly for me.

I forgot to add this to my review! As far as the corn goes, I added the one can of cream corn the recipe called for, one can of whole kernel corn and a can of the mexican corn with the milti colored bell peppers in it! very pretty and delicious to boot! It was almost like a stew, and that is how we like it!

I've made this recipe for years now; got it from a lady at church. How neat to find it on allrecipes.com! This is probably my favorite soup of ALL time. I haven't found a person yet that does not rave about it. If you don't have cream-style corn, you can use frozen corn instead.(I've done it, and couldn't really tell the difference)

This recipe was great! The whole family enjoyed it. I did alter it just a bit - I used the montery jack cheese w/ jalapenos and omitted the cumin, and green chilies. The jalapenos in the cheese was plenty enough spice for the entire recipe! Mmmmmm Will make this one again for sure:)

I've made it twice and both times everyone swore it was the best soup they had ever eaten.  I add chopped cilantro directly to the soup with the tomatoes...it adds that little extra something.  Also, try it with chili powder instead of cumin.  Fabulous.

Sooooo Good! I use evaporated milk and add 4oz. extra water. I omit the tomato and use a heathy couple of glugs of Frank's Hot Sauce. This adds an additional layer of flavour that is a must have. This is fast and easy to make after a long day's work and you would have most everything right in the freezer and on the pantry shelf.

Very tasty and quick.  The whole family loved it.  I think I will add more corn next time and I think I would prefer shredded chicken over cubed.  This is a very good 'base' recipe that you can easily jazz up with your own additions. Potatoes would work well.

Five starts for the combination. There are somethings that go together so well and this combo does. It is very robust, as others, I didn't have all the exact ingredients. Frozen corn instead of creamed, no green chillies so I used a half cup salsa, evaporated milk and milk to make 2 cups, and a combination of cheeses of whatever I had. still awesome, my son wanted the recipe. I am sure it will be even better (more Savory) with the exact ingredients.

Made this as listed and found The chowder to be too blah for us. As listed, personally would only give a 3 rating.  When following original recipe, used two cloves garlic instead of one, and used chicken broth instead of water.  After taste test before serving, decided to add another can of creamed corn, additional teaspoon of Cumin, Additional tablespoon of hot sauce ,  a can of  tomatoes with chilies and cup of cheddar cheese.  Hubby and I both loved altered recipe. Hate to alter recipes but know what our taste preferences are. Was a great starter. Rated 5 so I Know to make again.

Made this for a friend who is recovering from surgery.  It was a hit.  I ate a bowl before I took it over and yes, the flavor is there.  I kept with the recipe but, added an extra clove of garlic just because I love garlic and instead of cilantro for garnish I did mince up a handful of it and mixed it in.  A keeper!

Very good soup, I added more spices such as Chile powder and salt and pepper. I also added carrots and potatoes as others suggested. To thicken it up a bit 1 packet  of country gravy mix at the end. Just mix with a small amount of water and add a small amount of the hot soup and stir in. Cook for 1-2 minutes. I served the cheese and chips with the soup.

Turned out great. Didn’t use chicken. Used homemade vegetable stock and diced jalapeños and added a quarter cup of salsa instead of tomatoes.

Excellent!  I used cooked chicken because I had it and added about 1.5c frozen corn (in addition to the creamed corn) for more color and more veggies.  I added both of those with the bouillon.  My tomato was large, so I only used half of it.  I served it with cilantro, crunchy tortilla strips, and sour cream as garnishes.  The tomato worked well but added color more than flavor, so next time, I want to try cajun bell pepper or Mexibell pepper instead.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!  Definitely a keeper!

Great flexible recipe. I forgot the cheese, used veggie broth instead of water. Didnt have chicken. Didnt put hot sauce as I wanted my kids to try it. Still so amazingly delicious. A person could add tons to this soup and it would be even better. Browned onion and garlic and chicken in butter. Then threw it all in crock pot.

Made it per the recipe and won the soup and chili cook off at church (8 other recipes)!! Was a big hit.  I made a batch of 28 servings (3.5 time the recipe). I blended about 4 cups of the soup together with flour to thicken and then re married it with soup.  I also used rotisserie chicken.    Loved it!

This recipe was good! I was hoping for a little bit more spice, but that could easily be done with some more hot sauce! I think next time I make it I may add some small cubes potatoes!

Very good, I’d make it again.  You could make it less rich by using less half & half, maybe substitute milk.  It was a little too rich.

I am making the following changes. I am adding a Pablano pepper (chopped) to be cooked with the onion and garlic. I am adding a can of whole kernel corn and 1/4 tsp cayenne.

This was a good Chicken Corn Chowder. I am looking for great. I think these changes will move it closer.

This is a wonderful base receipe that we will definitely be making again. I changed some things, like boiling and deboning a whole chicken, adding frozen corn, jalapenos and garnishing with green onions and avocado.

A great recipe in theory, but the actual execution needed some tweaks. 

I used homemade chicken stock, and added two mashed boiled potatoes at the end as it was just too thin and watery, as well as considerably more cumin and some smoked paprika to add depth of flavor.  

Finished with a spoonful of chipotle salsa that I had on hand instead of diced tomatoes. 

Next time, I'll make a roux before adding the stock to thicken things up. Otherwise it's like soup bits floating in milk.

We had this for dinner last night and it was fantastic! I kicked it up a bit with extra cayenne pepper.  Today I'm heating up the leftovers and adding carrots and diced potatoes.  I think next time I'll use shredded chicken instead as the chunks seemed a little 'intrusive.'  You must try this one!

For me this was way too sweet and lacked depth. Aside from more seasonings/spices, what it really needs is something to counter balance the sweetness of the corn and the cream. I added some bitter beer at the end after tasting, and that helped. Then I also added some Parmesan and that gave it a little more balance. If I make it again I'd swap out the jack cheese entirely for one with more earthiness or sharpness and definitely add a lot more seasoning than it calls for. It's a good starting point for a recipe but needs a lot more flavor depth to suit my taste.

Excellent.  Soup is fun and forgiving!  I modified by using heavy cream, omitted cream style corn and substituted green chili salsa for green chilies.  Spice to your liking!

This did a good job of eliminating holiday leftovers:  chicken broth, sauteed onion (from a dish that got axed), turkey, creamed corn & some chiles!  Impressive!  Haha!  Good, not amazing; adding salsa or pico would be nice.  :D

Very tasty after making changes as per other reviewers. I think the recipe as-is would be good but a little lacking for my taste. I used chicken stock instead of bouillon - about 4 cups of it - and added one stalk of celery and one carrot to the broth. Added two diced red potatoes and frozen corn along with the creamed corn. Also whisked about 3T of flour into the half/half before adding it. It was a very hearty, thick chowder!

I would definitely make this again. It is even good cold.  I think I would add more corn and possibly a bit of carrot. I would hazard to say that this one of my new comfort foods.

I made this soup with a couple of changes. Instead of using heavy cream I used half sour cream and half water. Instead of hot sauce and tomato I used three heaping Tbsp of salsa. It turned out great. We will look forward to making it again.

We were craving Mexican corn chowder, but needed to do it with items we had on hand.  We used vegetarian chicken and vegetable bouillon cubes.  We didn't have chilis or tomatoes, so we used a can of Rotel and a can of green enchilada sauce.  Instead of cream, we used a can of evaporated milk.  Instead of a can of creamed corn, we used a frozen 16 oz bag of whole kernel.  Our MoJack was just sprinkled on top.  SooOOoo, all that to point out JUST GO FOR IT! It's not rocket science, and  this recipe is so good, you can't screw it up..

Used this as inspiration for my own version. Make roux with 1 stick butter and flour. Use 4 cans corn 3 with juice for corn flavored broth. Use shredded chicken. Use the onion double garlic and season with salt cumin cilantro and cayenne.  Use milk. Thicken with corn starch if needed for super thick chowder. No tomato, No chiles. Top with chedder or jack. 5 stars.

This was REALLY good!  I did add about 4 ounces of sour cream, red and green pepper, and as much hot sauce as I thought my 3-year-old could take... And, this was delicious. Everyone loved it, and we ate it for leftovers, too!  Will make again!

I have been making this for years in a restaurant  and get nothing but raves for the chowder! I, of course, increased the amounts of everything and substituted frozen corn rather than cream-style, therefore I used heavy cream rather than 1/2 & 1/2 and thickened it a bit with a flour roux. Excellent!

So simple yet really delicious! I also used chicken stock instead of bouillon cubes as others suggested. I double the corn using 2 cans. And seasoning the chicken with a spicy mixture before cooking. Yum!

I followed the basic recipe & then adjusted it a bit to my taste & cooking style....which is to WING IT! :))   It turned out really good, easy & worthy of many repeats!

Note to self: Used chicken leg meat (simmered in knorr's chicken stock. Added a handful or two of finely chopped spinach, a bit of carrot & celery. Doubled the recipe, at least. Didn't have any potatoes or hot sauce to use. Served with fresh tamales.

Recipe is great as is but I made some substitutions to make it healthier and heartier. First off I only use one cup of half and half, use skim milk for the other cup. I also double the amount of cream of corn and add frozen sweet corn, about two cups. It needs the textural difference. Lastly, instead of dicing a tomato which I find never cooks properly in the soup, I added one 14 ounce can of petite diced tomatoes, juice and all. Delish!

Loved loved loved!!  I did use some of the suggestions, made my own broth,  added potatoes and frozen corn. I also didn't use the chilies or tomatoes, but I added a fresh jalapeño. I won't use potatoes next time. 
Can't wait to make again!!

Double the onion, double or triple garlic, 2-15 Oz cans chicken broth and 2 cups 1/2&1/2 (same as recipe, but no bouillon or hot water), 1 quart bag frozen corn, & add 2-3 medium unpeeled & cubed red potatoes.  Save cheese for topping on bowl along with tomatoes and fresh cilantro. Cornbread on the side a plus with an already wonderful dish.  Yum!!!

Great recipe.   My major change in this recipe was that I omitted the chicken.   I didn't have enough chicken for both this and the chimichangas that I made to go with this, so I made the chicken in my dutch oven that I used for the chowder, and then added in my onion and garlic.   The soup was delicious and nicely creamy.   I did add in a bit more cumin,  and garnished with cilantro and green onions.   This is a keeper and I will make again, probably with chicken next time, but this is wonderful without as well.

OMG! This is a scrumptious soup that my husband said would be on his short list of dishes if he had to pick just a few.  I did add more cumin, chili powder, and a bit more hot sauce. Added corn flour to thicken up and strips of fried tortilla strips to the soup to help thicken and add flavor. Added a can of regular corn.  Added garnishes of lime, avocado, and cilantro.
Definitely a keeper!

I have made this twice actually.  First time, made as written and was very yummy.  My girls ate it up!  Second time, I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs for a juicier meat.  And it definitely was meatier.  I added about 1/2 teaspoon of chipotle chili powder instead of the hot sauce to see if I could get a smoky flavor.  It wasn't really smokier, though it had a nice subtle "peppery heat" that rolled around towards the end of the bite.  I also omitted the green chili peppers, instead I chopped a jalapeno for garnish for those who like it hot.  I didn't put the cheese into the chowder either.  I put it on the table, along with the tomatoes and cilantro.  The second chowder felt more "grown up", I guess you could say.  Served with corn tortillas (cause I had some leftover).  This is probably my new favorite chowder!  Thanks for sharing!

This was just ok for me. I would like more chicken, and I would prefer it shredded instead of cubed. But that's a preference. I just didn't think this had much flavor to it.

This was a great base recipe. I did some minor alterations partially due to the fact that I was unsure how spicy this would be and I cannot handle a lot of spice. The other part was due to the fact that I LOVE corn. I used chicken that had been herb baked from my local market, since I didn't have time to cook the chicken properly. I omitted the hot sauce, green chilies and tomato and replaced it with mild Rotel which I know I can handle. I also added an extra can of whole kernal corn (drained). Following the recipe with the substitutions, I found it to be an extremely fast soup to make. My parents and brother were very happy with dinner. Thank you to the original cook for giving me a wonderful base recipe!

Had to make a few adjustments to what I had in my pantry. Couldn't run to the grocery store. Instead of chili peppers, I used 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. No milk, used two cans of evaporated milk.  No Monterey Jack cheese. Added 4 small potatoes, peeled and diced. Yummy!

I absolutely love this recipe but I made a few changes. I made it in a crock pot on high for 4-6 hours. I doubled the creamed corn and used the cheese as a garnish as someone else suggested. I also added a bit more cumin and I made jalapeño corn bread on the side. My 8 year old loves to eat this.

Cut up the chicken and browned in a separate pan while I sautéed onions, garlic, celery and red bell pepper in the pot. I also oven roasted a poblano pepper and chopped then added that to the stock.  I used one can chicken stock instead of bullion adding salt, pepper and about 1/4 teas. of cumin. I also used about half as much cheese as the recipe but thickened it a bit with flour. The rest of the recipe, I followed.  Really good!

Chowder was great with a few tweaks,  used thighs cause I think they do better - give off more flavor.  Used broth instead of bullion, 2 cans of creamed corn and instead of topping with chopped tomatoes - they are out of season - I added a can of petit diced tomatoes right in the pot.  Also doubled the green chilies - next time I think I'll  use Rotel instead of plain tomatoes.  Swapped out the half and half for milk and at the very end put in about 1/2 of cream I had on hand.  Only mixed in half the cheese and saved the rest for bowl garnish.   Will definitely go into my file folder under favorites.

This is a tasty soup with some changes.  After reading several reviews I added potatoes right before I added the half and half.  I also used a can of chicken broth instead of the water and soup base in place of the bouillon.  I doubled the hot sauce and added some fresh ground pepper.   Right before serving I threw a drained can of corn kernels.  Very tasty with the changes.

We really enjoyed this, used too much cheese though. I added diced potato and used broth  and Rotelie as substitutes. Will add more kernel corn next time to give more crunch.

This tasted so good, but I did make changes:
2 tbls butter,
1 can of chicken broth,
2 cups of milk,
no cheese or tomatoes.
I also used a jalapeño that I had, but may try the chilies and hot sauce because I couldn't taste the jalapeño.  
I also added 1/2 pkg of bacon.  I chopped and cooked it in Dutch oven. I reserved the bacon for the end, then cooked onions and garlic in bacon grease.
Mixed 2 tbsp of flour to the butter, onions, and garlic. 
Added 1 tsp salt and red pepper.
Dash of cayenne pepper.
For chicken I seasoned it with salt, pepper, and some cajun spiced.  I baked it in oven and added to soup.

Very good!! I added a can of white beans (rinsed and drained) and cilantro. I served it with cornbread waffles (on this site) and everyone loved it. I garnished with avocado, lime and extra cilantro.

Fantastic! The whole family loved it.  I substituted chicken stock, used skim milk, and used a few tablespoons of salsa instead of tomato, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  I will definitely make this again.

As written, I'd give this recipe 4 stars. It did not have the bold flavor I expect out of Mexican food, but it definitely had potentential. I just made this soom again last night with the following changes: 1 (14.75 oz) can chicken broth instead of water, juice from 1 lime, 1 heaping tsp ground cumin, 1/2 tsp aleppo pepper flakes, shredded pepper jack cheese instead of monterrey jack, 2 cans cream style corn as others have suggested, and 1 can rotel tomatoes instead of the fresh tomatoes and green chilis. Because it wasn't already fattening enough, I also added a dollop of sour cream as a garnish. :-) With these changes, I did not find the meal to be too spicy, and may amp it up more by using the hot rotel tomatoes next time.

AMAZING! My family finished every last drop! I followed the recipe almost exactly except I used a can of tomatoes and green chiles instead of a fresh tomato. I used 1 cup half and half and 1 cup 1% milk. It was still thick and delicious! Next time I may add some chopped jalapeños for that extra peppery kick. I'm definitely adding this to my frequently made recipes!

I LOVE this recipe. I made a few modifications to my own personal taste. First, I shredded the meat off of a rotisserie chicken. I added a little less than a cup of chicken stock I had in the fridge in addition to the cup of hot water with bouillon cube just because I was worried there wouldn't be enough liquid after not cooking the chicken with the onion and garlic. I also added a can of whole kernel corn.

This is pretty good. I used a rotisserie chicken de-boned. I do feel that it's missing something and I think it's a can of rotel or a chili powerder. I'mm make this again soon.

I love this recipe! I made a few changes, as well. I use half-n-half when I have it (I usually freeze it into ice cubes so it doesn't go bad before I get to it), but I have substituted evaporated milk with no problem. Instead of bouillon cubes in hot water, red pepper sauce and 1 chopped tomato, I used enough Better than Bouillon paste in hot water to make broth (about 1 tsp. per cup), a dash of red pepper flakes, and 1 can of diced tomatoes. I do not put the cheese in this soup. I find it makes a stringy mess. I will let my kids top it off in their bowls, if they choose to have it. I have made extra and bottled this recipe with no problems, and also put some in freezer bags and froze it. It's a great make ahead recipe!

Very easy recipe. I did substitute thigh meat, which is better in soups. Also prefer to use heavy whipping cream rather than half and half and chicken broth rather than bullion. The soup is very tasty.

I've made this several times and its always a hit! I just love it!! The only changes I make are I add chicken broth instead of water and I roast chicken breast in the oven and shred it in the soup. I also use a full can of whole corn to add more texture. Its super yummy!

Very good base recipe worthy of 5 stars, and you can change up the spices and other ingredients to get the flavor you like. I added cayenne pepper and freshly ground black pepper because we like more heat. I also used salsa instead of fresh tomatoes to give it more flavor. I didn't have cream corn, so I used a bag of frozen corn and added a can of cream of potato soup. I'll use this recipe again and make changes based on what ingredients I have on hand.

I'm giving this five stars because with a small adjustment, that's what it is. I just had to add some extra cumin, black pepper, and some chili powder. We loved this and will make it again. I made it in my slow cooker. I sauteed the onion and garlic in the butter, transferred it to the slow cooker, added two FROZEN chicken breasts, and everything else EXCEPT the half-and-half. I cooked on low for 7 hours and then removed the chicken to shred. I added the shredded chicken back into the slow cooker along with the half-and-half, adjusted the spices (added), and then cooked for about 20 minutes more. Topped with shredded pepper jack instead for added flavor. Loved it!

I added a pinch of chili powder and 1 more can of corn, as recommended by the reviewers.  I wish I had only used the suggested 1, however, because sweetness was the dominant taste of the chowder, followed only later by the saltiness and spiciness.

A great recipe for family gatherings. Be careful to keep the temp. And simmer time down just before and after adding the cream to avoid curdling.

My family really enjoyed it. The recipe is very good on its own but for my personal taste I prefer it to be a bit thicker and I added some diced potatoes.  Garnish with cilantro,cheese,tomatoes and bits of tortilla chips.

Everyone loved this recipe.  I followed the recipe and got rave reviews.  I had vegetarians visit and I tweaked the recipe slightly.  I used vegetable broth and instead of chicken, I added an additional can of creamed corn.  Once again, everyone loved the flavor.

This soup was amazing- very delicious. I did take someones suggestion of adding 3 sliced (cut into cubes) corn tortillas about 15 minutes prior to serving and then adding 2 cut up flour tortillas about 5 mintues before serving. I also used 2% milk as I didn't have any half and half and used chicken thigh meat as I was out of chicken breast. Amazing recipe.

I didn't have everything on hand so I changed a few things.  I used 2 Cups chicken stock and 1 C light cream. I used less cheese only 1 Cup.  Didn't have clilis so I used a bit of frozen corn with peppers in it instead.  Also substituted dried cilantro for fresh.  The family loved it but thought it would be better without the chicken.  I found this interesting considering we are meat eaters.
Great base recipe.  Have fun with it.  Thanks for sharing...

While I modified this a little bit to use what I had on hand, I found this to be a perfectly flavorful, delicious, and comforting soup - perfect for lunch after spending the morning raking leaves!
I used canned stock, since I prefer to use less sodium. And chose evaporated milk over half/half, since I had that on hand too. My tomatoes were from leftover homemade marinara sauce from the freezer and it worked beautifully. A little extra frozen whole kernal corn, and I was set! --I tend to try all sorts of new recipes; my boyfriend requested I stick with this one (or at least remember it). :)

This was fantastic! Full of flavor, great consistency, just delicious. Instead of half and half I used 2 cups of fat free evaporated milk, a healthy substitute and you would NEVER know that it wasn't half and half in the soup as it still maintained a nice creamy texture.

I have been making this recipe for 10 years. My whole family loves it! Everytime I take it somewhere everyone always asks for the recipe. I made it for my parents 40th anniversary party. Everyone raves about it. I stopped measuring things a long time ago and just dump it in my crockpot. I use precooked chicken and frozen corn. Mmmm! Try it

It was fabulous.... I added 2 pieces of left over seasoned chicken breast, added 1 addition can of regular corn, only had 1 cup of cream (Which still worked out). I loved it. I think this will be a huge hit with my kids too.

This did not thicken up for me and form a chowder, was a thin soup.  I added fresh corn and am glad I did otherwise I don't think we'd have had a strong corn taste.  Not sure I will make this again.

My husbands fav soup, really the only thing he ever asks me to make just for him!!  TY for the recipe!  The only thing I change is instead of cooking the chicken (which can get dry) I buy a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken and just add it in when I add the cheese.  So juicy and fast.  This is a great fast soup!

Originally I was going to give this recipe 4 stars as a good, easy basic soup.  But then I had the leftovers, and they were so much better than the first night that I now feel this recipe rates a solid 5!  The flavors were stronger and the soup tasted great.  Just made a small change- I had extra chicken broth so added it to the soup, then cubed some baked potatoes and threw them in.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written and served it with cheddar beer bread.  I will definitely make this many times during the long, cold Cleveland winter!  3/10/12 update-  used canned tomatoes and chilies, and some pepper jack cheese.

I have been looking for a cream based corn chowder for a long time.  This recipe was amazing!  I changed a few things but I never follow recipes to a T anyway.  I used shredded chicken from a cooked rotisserie chicken sauteed it in butter, onion, garlic & added cumin while boiling it but I didn't measure it out.  I think I added a little over double of cumin than what it asked for.  I used heavy cream instead of half & half, used a can of cream corn & a cup of frozen corn, a can of chicken broth, and a can of hot rotel, drained.  I tripled the amount of cheese that it called for, and it still didn't turn out too cheesy.  I did let it cook for about 20 minutes on low after I added everything so that all of the flavors blended together more.  I served it with crispy baked corn tortillas & dashes of Frank's Hot Sauce.  My husband had 3 bowls of it.  It was better the 2nd day & at it's best on the 3rd!  Definitely a cold weather must!!

such a yummy filling soup. I use cubed potatoes  instead of chicken since I never remember to thaw it and don't have a micro. I also add a can of regular corn, black beans, and use pepper jack cheese for a little bit more zip. Avocado also makes for a nice addition/garnish. Great for making in advance and taking to school/work.

This is the best soup. My children constantly ask me to make this for dinner. I use chiken broth instead of water and add a few cans of whole kernel corn. I also use heavy whipping cream and add extra green chilies. This is the best soup for a cool fall day, and it is so easy to make.

I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe.  It is delicious.  Everyone who has tried it also loves it.  It won first place in our church's soup cook off.  I do change it up a little bit.  I add extra cheese and also some finely chopped jalepeno peppers.  I also add some cubed potatoes.  After all what's a chowder without potatoes.  I will continue to make this again and again!!!

Giving this 4 stars because I haven't tasted it yet, but it smells great, was easy to put together, and adapted well to what I had on hand.  A great way to use a half an onion, some potatoes and pantry staples.  The true test will be whether or not the kids eat it!  After school sports tend to work up a hearty appetite, so this should fit the bill.

A great soup and easy to make.  I used regular canned corn because that's what I had and did not add tomato at the end.    Definitely a keeper!

Goodness.  This is AMAZING.  I 'cheat' and use a rotisserie chicken from the store.  I just shred it all up.  I also add a can of white beans because we love beans and it makes it even more hearty.  It is equally as awesome as leftovers.  Thank you so much for this delicious recipe!

This is soooooo good!  I used leftover turkey from Christmas, used 1 whole large onion, and 3 cloves of garlic.  I also added about a teaspoon of chili powder.  YUMYUM!!!

My family's favorite winter dish. Instead of chiles and a chopped tomato, I use 1 can of rotel.

This is the best soup ever! I either omit chicken bouillon or boil chicken bones in water for the flavor! And to use less processed food, I also use fresh corn instead of creamed style corn, the soup is less dense but fresh corn taste is harder to beat. LOVE LOVE LOVE

I love this soup! I made it for a soup exchange and everyone loved it. Only thing I change is to double the creamed corn. Serve it with chips and salsa and it's a perfect lunch.

very easy and tasty recipe.  seems like it could use just a tad bit more spice, so maybe a cup of pepperjack cheese would help.  thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!  I used a regular can of corn instead of creamed and it turned out great!  I also used a little less cheese and half and half and a little more chicken broth than was called for.

I use a recipe very similar to this I got from Taste of Home. I like to use make broth by boiling the chicken before I start the rest of the recipe.  This is also a great recipe to use up leftover chicken and turkey.

This goes over very well.  I make it for my family and my office.  I do change it up a little:  instead of chicken buillon & water, I add 1can low sodium chicken broth, 4 c. half & half, 1 sm. bag frozen corn, 4 sm. red potatoes peeled & chopped, and 1 can rotelle tomatoes (drained) instead of tomatoes & green chiles then top with the cilantro and a dallop of sour cream. Wonderful with chips.

This was very good.  Next time I will omit the water and try decreasing the half and half because it wasn't as thick as you would expect a chowder to be.  Very tasty.

This is one of my favorite soup recipes.  It's super easy to throw together.  I made changes based upon what I had on hand and it's pretty low fat.    I used ground chicken instead of chicken breast, chicken stock instead of bullion and water, fat free half and half,  about 1/2 bag of Trader Joe's roasted corn (this is what made the soup amazing) instead of creamed corn, no cumin as I didn't have any and about 1 cup of salsa instead of tomato since I didn't have one.  I've done it with the cheese and without and it's good either way.

So delicious!!  I added a can of garbanzo beans and a can of corn, which gave it just the right texture.  The garbanzo beans complemented the soup really well and also gave it additional protein.  Also substituted chicken stock for the boulion and water.

Very yummy. It really is more like tortilla soup than corn chowder though. I froze some and saved it for later and it reheated well.

I love this recipe!! I tweaked it a little by reducing the amount of Green Chiles and leaving out the hot pepper sauce, but then putting a bowl of chilies out when serving so people can add the amount of "heat" they prefer. I also add, in addition to the sprig of cilantro, a dollup of sour cream and seasoned tortilla strips on top for presentation.

This was soooo good even the kids loved it.  I didn't add any tomato, hot pepper sauce, or cilantro.  I left the diced green chiles out of the kids chowder but added Jalapenos to the adult chowder...delicious.

I altered this recipe slightly to make it healthier and it still came out great.  I used 2 cups of fat free half and half instead of the full fat version, and only half the amount of cheese that was recommended.  Still was delicious and everyone loved it.

This soup was great!!  I did add a can of sliced potatoes to the soup and a can of crab meat.  This made is sooooo good!  I love spicey food but have to take it easy because we have little ones in the house.  So me and my hubby just sprinkle red pepper on the soup while in our bowl!  Perfect!

My husband said this is one of the best soups I've made!!  I did make some changes . . . was looking for a regular Corn Chowder recipe & decided to try this one without the Mexican additions, so did not add the hot sauce, green chili's & tomatoes, and used less cumin.  Then, we ended up adding those at the end as garnishes.  It turned out really good!

I cheated and used a rotisserie chicken but we really enjoyed the flavors of this soup.  I served it with Tostitos Scoops and used those as little spoons.  Not very filling but really warmed us up on a cool night.  I also thickened with some corn starch dissolved in water.  Will probably make again!

What an awesome recipe!!!  It was a little bit spicy for my husband and younger daugther - but I thought the heat was great!  I thickened it up a bit with flour & water, but substituting potatoes would have worked great.  I will be sharing & amking this one again.

I did it again and cut back on the cumin.  Only used 1/4 t and it was seasoned enough.  I also did not use chicken bouillion - i used stock.  

I have used this recipes numerous times and everyone loves it!!!

This is a wonderful chowder recipe and I will use this many times. I did use 2% milk instead of the half/half. Like others suggested I increased the cumin to 2t. Because I like a thicker chowder I added some cornstarch. My husband loved this chowder!

So Yummy! I used a few extra cloves of garlic and had to use a half a can of rotel because I was out of regular green chilies. I also used chalula ( Mexican Hot Sauce) instead of regular because it's what I had on hand. I used extra cumin like other users suggested. Hubby and I topped with extra shredded cheese, a dollop of sour cream and a few corn chips for crunch. Will definately be making again!

Excellent soup! Wonderful flavor! I used homemade chicken stock rather than the water and the bouillon. I also upped the cumin to 1 tsp. I used pepper Jack cheese which gave it an even greater zip. Also I didn't have any creamed corn so I used 1 can of drained regular corn. I also added some short grain brown and wild rice only because I only had a half pound of leftover chicken. The soup was superb!

I enjoyed this recipe.  However, I tripled the cumin and added fresh corn off of the cob.  I also cooked it in a slow cooker vs a dutch oven on top of stove.  I used mexican blend cheese along with pepper jack which gave it a kick since I love spicy and hot food.  I served with tri-color nacho chips.  

My friends loved it.

This was tasty!  I omitted the green chiles (husband doesn't like them, I do).  I also used a mixture of half and half and heavy whipping cream.  My husband and friend really liked it.

Delicious! It could have used another (or just more) thickening ingredients though, to make it more chowder-like.

I made this recipe with canned chicken on a cold, snowy afternoon (couldn't get to the store for fresh chicken)...family loved it!!  Served it with hot, steamy corn bread and we had a great snow day meal!

I've made this for several different family gatherings, and I come home with an empty crockpot every time. The only thing I do different is to use a can of tomatoes and green chiles instead of the fresh tomato and can of chiles.

I followed the recipe and added a few more things to the first step: two chopped carrots and two chopped celery stalks.  This added a little bit more flavor and chunkiness to this easy one-pot supper!  It was very yummy on such a cold night.  I will make it again.

This was really delicious.  I omitted the tomatoes and the chilies and added two jalepeno peppers instead.  Definitely spicy, but so good.  I didn't have half and half but used a combo of heavy cream and milk, which turned out a little bit thinner than I would have liked.  Anyway, definitely worth making!

Yum! I used half monterey and half pepper jack. Also, I roasted a Cornish Game Hen and used that meat instead of chicken breast. This dish is delicious, incredibly easy to make, but comes across in an impressive way. I will add some jalapenos next time, to give it a little more kick.

Made this as written, using 1 cup of velveeta and 1 cup 2% shredded Mexican cheese and then a can of diced tomatoes in place of the tomato (grocery store tomatoes in the winter in Chicago don't look that great...).  Also used at least double the cumin - could barely taste it otherwise - and added a little cayenne.  Also used 1.5 cups skim milk and 1/2 cup half and half, thickened with some corn-starch.  It tasted good, but I wasn't a huge fan - but the boy liked it and said he'd eat it again - so I might make it again.  Maybe.  I think it may just be that the Cheesy Potato and Corn Chowder on this site is SO AMAZING with a little Tex-Mex kick, that this one pales in comparison.

This is really good! I used pepper jack cheese and I thought the spice level was just right. I didn't have any tomatoes, so I had to do without that. Will gladly make it again. I've never made a soup with cheese before and wasn't sure if it would melt properly or if it would be lumpy, but it was perfect. 
I think it would be good with shredded roasted chicken too.

I loved this recipe!  I made it for my husband and two teenagers and we ate the entire pot!  I did make a couple of changes.  I used Tyson southwest season grilled chicken strips, reduced the cumin to 1/2 tsp. and added a can of whole kernel corn.  I also didn't use the cilantro.  Next time I will make a double batch and cut the chicken pieces even smaller.

Very good!  I added three small potatoes, which I peeled and diced into very small pieces.  I didn't have cream-style corn and used a can of drained whole kernel corn and added about a cup of frozen corn.  I used salsa in place of the tomatoes and doubled the cumin, added taco seasoning and chili powder.  Instead of half and half, I used milk.  I'll be making this again...it's very easy to put together!

We love this recipe! One of our winter staples. I got it off of a different site, but it's essentially the same. I just cook it on the stove top, not in a dutch oven. Other than that, we like the recipe as is. Also, I have to say, it looks much better than it does in this picture. We garnish with cilantro, sour cream and tortilla strips. Some other variations I've tried are grilling then shredding the chicken, no chicken at all for a wonderful meatless chowder, and my dad hates corn, so I didn't use the corn one time. They were all great!! I say it is more like 5 servings, not 8.

Ohhhh so delicious!! Made this tonight and family loved it. Very hearty and satisfying. I did make a few changes....I sauteed the onions, garlic and added a chopped carrot with a little olive oil,(omitted the butter). I added the chicken, salt, pepper, and 1 tsp. of cummin, let the chicken cooked 3/4 of the way and added 1 1/2 cans of chopped green chilies (4 oz. cans). I then added 2 cups of fat free/low sodium chicken broth (instead of the boullion). I threw in about 1 c. of diced potatoes and 1 1/2 ears of fresh left over corn on the cob (cut off the cob)let that come to a boil and reduced to a simmer until the potatoes were tender. I then added the 1 can of creamed corn, 1 1/2 c. of fat free half and half and 1 c. of taco cheese blend. I used a little corn starch and water to thicken. Let me tell you.....it was so fantastic! This will definately be in my soup rotation for this fall/winter. I jazzed my own bowl up a little and added a few dashes of cayenne pepper! So yummy!!

This was fantastic comfort food.  Even the kids requested I put it on the do again list.  I added chorizo sausage for a little more interest.  Also the kids don't like hot food so I served theirs then added some chilli sauce to the rest.

This was pretty nice. I used 1 ear of fresh corn and threw it in; it got cooked just fine. I also used goat's milk and 1 tbsp of butter to substitute for the half-and-half and it tasted good. It works well to eat with slices of avocado, too! Will make again.

This soup was good but not great.  It was really sweet and I wanted it to be more spicy.  I also used a can of Rotel as others did.  I wanted it to be thicker than it was too.  I did add some flour but it didn't thicken up like I wanted it to.

This was good after changing it up quite a bit.  I used 2 lbs. of chicken, 3 BIG garlic cloves, 1 tsp. cumin and added a 15 oz. can of corn. With having to change a recipe that much, I just don't think it warrants 5 stars.  I think it still needs a little kick, so next time I will add more hot pepper sauce and salt and pepper, as mentioned by other reviewers.  I DO like how easy it is, though.

This is such a simple recipe but has so much flavor! I use Rotel and Mexican Cheese. Adding fresh cilantro and diced green onions is a must! Having chicken that is marinated first will take this recipe over the top!

I made this with chicken from a pouch, added way more ground cumin, and I also used canned diced tomatoes that were left over from a previous recipe. Husband said it would have been better if it had more of a kick, but it was perfect for a chile pepper wimps like me. We had it with salad, and lots of cornbread. Good stuff. Thanks, Jeanne!

Very yummy soup!  It came out a bit spicier than I thought it would, but the chilis that I used were more potent than the canned Old El Paso variety.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was wonderful.  I followed some of the suggestions of others and used evaporated milk instead of half and half and rotel instead of chilis and tomato.  I also cooked this in the crock pot and used four ears of fresh corn in place of the canned which meant I had to thicken it with some flour.  A great recipe to play with.

This is a really good soup, but I did use whole milk instead of half & half to make it less fattening.  I also forgot to add the hot sauce & I didn't miss it.  It seems like there is a lot of chicken in the soup.  Next time I think I will only use one pound of chicken & add a cup of frozen corn along with the can of creamed corn.  I may also add some dried cilantro during cooking rather than adding fresh at the end as a garnish.

I can't believe that I made something that tasted this good.  I made just as the recipe directed except with a can of tomatoes and a can of chiles, and sauted in olive oil instead of butter.  Just great!  I will definitely make again, my husband loved it too!  Best recipe I've found on allrecipes.

This was good.  I followed some of suggestions and a can of rotel.  I also added a second can of creamed corn.  Next time I'll add a little more garlic and cumin to make up for the extra corn.  This will be a great new soup recipe to make this winter!

I made this for a dinner for a friend.  We all really liked it.  I substituted the green chiles & tomato with Pace Medium Picante.  I also added a can of corn.  I used the suggestion of using Rotisserie Chicken from Sams...it was delicious!

This was very good and easy. I didn't have green chiles but I used shredded Mexican cheese with jalapenos.  It added just the right kick without making it too spicy for the kids. Next time, I'll use a little less butter.

I've had better chicken/corn chowder soups. This one was a little bland - and I added more bouillon and cumin then the recipe called for.  Don't think I would make it again.  The taste is not worth the calories.

I've been making this recipe for over a year now and it is a family favorite!  My only change is instead of canned green chiles I use a can of Rotel (diced tomatoes with green chiles) and add potatoes.  We love to eat this chowder with Doritos - strange, but tastes good!

I substituted one 15 oz. can of crushed tomatoes for the chopped and added considerably more spice - we like the heat!  I did not get a lot of corn taste - maybe it needs a little more?

This soup was good, but at the same time, it was a disappointment.  Maybe I was just expecting more because of the near consistent rave reviews it was getting.  One of the problems is that the chicken tastes very bland like this.  The soup itself tastes great, but when you bite into a piece of chicken, it is not flavorful at all.  Otherwise, it is pretty good.

Love the recipe just as it is. Haven't served it to a single person who didn't ask for the recipe afterwards.  Easily adaptable to suit individual tastes and diet requirements without losing any of it's original goodness.  GREAT RECIPE, JEANNE JONES!!  Thank you!

This recipes is awesome!  This was my first attempt at making a corn chowder and my family loved it!  The only thing extra I did was add more corn.  I added two extra cans of corn on top of the creamed corn and it was wonderful.  You might want to double the batch to make extra because the first batch won't last long!  Thanks so much for this recipe.

This was pretty good.  I too used leftover roasted chicken which made it easy to make, but I felt it lacked something.  Definitely needs some tabasco for zip, and...?  I might try this again,  and make some adjustments to see if I can improve upon it somehow.  Worth trying, but not a dynamite recipe.

This was easy to make and my husband loved it.  It stored well - the flavor got better and better.  This is a recipe that I will hang on to and continue to make.

This was awesome, my husband and I both loved it. It was just what we needed on a cold rainy day. I do admit I used whipping cream instead of half and half and I also added some canned jalapenos to give it a kick.  I will be adding this to our favorites.  I will also pass the recipe along to my friends.

I was hungry for a mexican soup and this recipe hit the spot! 
To lighten the recipe I used fat free 1/2 and 1/2... and it still tasted great! I also added more hot sauce to give it a bit more kick.

I made this last night and my family loved it.  I made a few changes, added a small can of regular corn as well as the can of cream corn in the recipe and instead of a dash of hot sauce I used about a teaspoon of red tabasco sauce.  Also put a bit more cheese in it.  As for the tomatoe in the end I put those in my bowl but the rest of my family put some spicy salsa on top and we all topped it with broken tortilla chips.
Fantastic!

Holy Moly! I am so amazed at how great this chowder tastes. I used fresh corn and made a homemade cream corn with it - another recipe from allrecipes - and it gave it great snappy texture. Thanks for sharing.

This is the best on a cold winter day!  I actually was going to post this myself but found someone else had already done it!  So I just had to share how much my family loves this recipe!  I make it instead of chili for football games and everyone loves it!!

This recipe was pretty good after adding making a few adjustments. I added 2 tsp of cumin. I used taco/nacho style cheese and added more corn-a can of whole kernel. I used diced tomatoes. The next time I make this a will use a hot salsa or hot rotel tomatoes and maybe even a pack of taco seasoning. Good recipe just not spicy enough.

This was really good!  I shredded the chicken instead of cubing it.  The corn and chicken and cheese together tasted so good.  Not a light meal by any means, but hearty.

I had high hopes for this one and it was just OK.  I did as others suggested and used the Ro-tel mexican tomatoes for extra flavor and shredded the chicken.  I also made my own creamed corn with some leftover roasted corn on the cob.  The end result wasn't all that flavorful and very greasy.  I ended up adding some chopped jalapeno peppers and crushed red pepper to kick it up.  Won't make this again.

I've made this many, many times.  It is excellent and fast to put together.  Better the next day as would be expected.  You can't miss with this visually, either.  Very nice recipe to keep on hand.

This recipe was not what i expected.  It was much too thin and runny for my taste.  To solve this problem, I ran about 2/3's of the soup through my blender in order to thicken it up.  After thickening the soup and doctoring the spices up a bit (we like very spicy food), it was quite good.

I did not care for this soup.  This recipe was too greasy/fatty with the half and half and all that cheese.  I love a cream-based soup, and I also love cheese but it was just too much.  If there is a next time, I will use milk.  However my (less picky) husband thought the soup was delicious and ate the leftovers for lunch.  

It is definitely filling enough to be the main course of your meal.

My husband, his parents & I loved this chowder.  I added a bit more chicken and a can of whole kernel corn.  I also used milk - it was fine.  Didn't have cilantro - it would have been a nice garnish - but this was great without.

We all enjoyed this very much.  I only used 1/2 the amt. of chilies, thinking it might be too spicy for the kiddoes, but I think the full amt. would have been fine.  I added extra chicken to up the protein and think a can of mexican-style corn would be a pleasant addition.  Thanks!

Wonderful!  I substituted the half and half with a can of evaporated skim milk.  I also used 2 cans of chicken broth and an can of regular corn in addition to the creamed corn.  While I like spicy food, I didn't want the green chiles to over power the soup, so I only used half of them.  This is a great winter soup!  Excellent!

My husband really enjoyed this soup.  I was hoping for something more.  All in all, it was pretty good!  If I make it again, I will use shredded chicken.

I also shredded the chicken beforehand, but might chop it into small pieces next time - otherwise it looks kinda like, well gross.  Tastes great though!  Used some other suggestions - the roux in the beginning I thought was key (cooked butter and flour until light brown then threw in garlic and followed the rest of the recipe verbatim), and will add the aromatics next time.  Threw in an extra can of extra sweet kernel corn, but will throw in another can of creamed corn next time - I like it sweeter.  Will also go with Pepper Jack cheese next time and the Rotel was a nice addition.  I didn't have any bouillon so I used chicken stock that I had boiled the chicken in and that worked fine, but might use the bouillon for more flavor next time (update: tried this and it was really salty, will go back to using the broth.  I really liked this chowder (it's really easy) - I had someone hold my soup for a sec while I did something and I turned around to catch him putting a 4th bite in his mouth!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I added more than a dash of the hot pepper sauce (more like 10 dashes!), 1 tsp of cumin, a small can of sliced black olives, and some sharp cheddar cheese.  Very good with crumbled tortilla chips.  I will make it with shredded chicken next time to see how that turns out.
