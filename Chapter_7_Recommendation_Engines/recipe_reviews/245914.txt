I was looking for a way to have my oatmeal on the go in the morning. I used 3 cups of oatmeal because I want that fiber. I did not use brown sugar, but the 1/4c of white as others did. I also subbed applesauce for the oil. I added some dried cranberries. I really liked how it came out not overly sweet but sweet enough. It came out nice and moist too. Would definitely make this again.

I was expecting this bar to be more granola like and crunchy. It is more cake like and moist. I added cranberries which my family likes. My little two year old grandson called this cake and he proceeded to gobble it all up. The recipe says it makes 8 servings, but I cut it up into 16 servings.

In general it turned out well but they weren't crunchy and tasted more like a pie. I added only half cup of milk instead of whole cup and next time I would add even less. 
I also added rasins, dried cranberries, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds and actualy all seeds I could find at home that time. And last thing to mention - I used one big spoon of Honey instead of sugar. And the taste was super good.

I made this two ways....one with suggestions to cut milk or add more dry ingredients. One made as recipe outlines.  This is a base recipe and designed to add dried fruit and nuts.  The recipe where I added 3 T of coconut flour came out  crumbly, I felt it was too dry.  The recipe where I followed the directions came out more cake like and held together well.  Both recipes I added dried fruit (cranberries, cherries) and seeds.  I did bump up the spices to 1T.  I made this with both dairy and with coconut milk.   Key to get a great bar that holds together is to let  ingredients sit to absorb moisture.  Doubles just fine.

We really liked these. They froze well as individual bars for snacking on the go later. These are cake-like. You may want to  increase the amount of spice and flavorings or else the finished flavor is a bit bland.  It is important to let the complete mixture soak before baking.  This allows the oats to absorb the liquid and soften. Baked in a parchment paper lined dish, with paper hanging over the edge.  After 30 min baking, removed the parchment paper with the bars and placed the parchment with the bars back on a wire oven rack to cook and additional  5 min.  Removed from the oven and gently sliced. Placed the slices back in the oven on a tray to cook for an additional 5 min to dry some and brown on all 4 sides of each bar.  Much like you would do for baking biscotti. Added additions of peanut butter powder, fine unsweetened coconut, and sliced almonds, as well as the recipe's cinnamon and vanilla.  Used only 1/4 C dark brown sugar and it turned out with with just a hint of sweetness....Personal preference.  Very nice recipe plain or for the addition of different enhancing ingredients.  Thanks!

I liked how easy it was. I made substitutions because I keep forgetting to buy brown sugar... So... 1/4 C. White sugar, 2 tsp. Cinnamon, and then drizzled 1/4 C. Maple syrup over the top in the pan. Also, added 1/3 C. raisins and 2 Tbs. Flax meal to dry mix. I am considering an extra Tablespoon of flour to make it easier to cut. Yummy!

People who complained about this recipe forget that it is a basic BAKED OATMEAL recipe and you can change it like you would a bowl of oatmeal. I love the simplistic recipe and add dried fruit, I cut the sugar back as well as substitute apple sauce for the oil. This is a great way to get your healthy fiber filled breakfast on the go.

I thought these were good.  They were not bland, as some have stated.  They simply tasted like oatmeal, which is what they are primarily made up of.  If more taste is desired, consider adding in ingredients with strong flavor like cranberries.  

As is, they do have a pleasant oatmeal flavor with just a touch or cinnamon, but I think the next time I am going to try some add ins.  I am going to try it with some peanut butter for added protein.   Another idea is Nutella for all the chocolate lovers.  Actually the possibilities are endless.  I think it would be good just using various grains and nuts.  

All in all, this was pretty quick to make and did not make a huge mess.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars.  I will definitely make it again.

Bland. I didn't mind the soft texture but it came out pretty bland. Next time I would sprinkle the brown sugar on top or add coconut flakes or something

I really liked that the bars were soft, although they  could've been more moist. I had even substituted all the sugar for a big spoon of raw creamy honey. I deducted half of the milk to level out the wet to dry ratio. Other than that, they were a hit with my 2 year old and my 14 year old. I added cranberries and raisins to mine!

This was really good. I would recommend using 1/2 cup of milk because when I made it, it had a bunch of liquid in the bowl still after I mixed it. I drained some of the liquid out and it turned out great. It’s a great base, I should say. By itself, it’s really plain and just taste like...oatmeal. I spread ~1 cup of melted milk chocolate chips on top after I baked it and it was delicious. I haven’t tried it with any other toppings or add-ins but I will definitely make this again.

I think the important thing to remember is to let the mix rest for 20 minutes. That makes sure all the oatmeal is thoroughly moistened. I skipped the white sugar, added raisins and substituted one of those little applesauce cups for the oil, and it turned out lovely. A little extra moistness and fruitiness from the applesauce was great.

This turned out great. I reduced sugar by 60%, and I added a bunch of raisins + sliced almonds. I will say it is like a dense cake, and it slices & packs well for grab-n-go breakfast. My first batch was a bit bland, so I may increase the spices/seasoning next time. I will definitely make it again and change it up with whatever I have on-hand.

UPDATE: I've made this several time now - each time adding a bit of whatever I have on-hand (cocoa nibs, preserved orange peels, pecans, coconut, cranberries, etc.) This recipe is so versatile – I can use almost anything and it comes out great!

Made twice so far!  First was a double batch with cranberries, coconut and nuts.  More substantial and healthier than a packaged breakfast bar.... perfect for the early mornings!

It just tasted like egg and soggy oatmeal.  A couple bites were all we could take.

Good recipe! I wanted a base recipe for a healthy, filling breakfast bar. This is great because I can add what I want to it. I followed the recipe then added a small handful of walnuts, 1/3c dried cranberries, 1/4c coconut flakes, and a whole chopped honeycrisp apple. I think without the apple this would have been heavier and drier.

I made mine in a muffin tin so they're ready to pop out and freeze. They came out soft slightly sweet with a eggy taste. so maybe next time I'll up the seasonings and add some fruits and nuts to give a bit more texture other than that it's good for something quick to grab on my way to work.

A little bland but next time I’ll add dried cranberries or blueberries and that should fix that problem. However the bottom was soggy so I think I’ll add 1/4 cup more oats.

Batch turned out great. I substituted 3 cups of quick oats vs rolled oats and cooked for 5 minutes more for the nice crunchy bottom. The top was sprinkled with finely  shaved coconut before cooking.

I added raisins and raw almonds, I lowered the temperature to 320 so it wouldn't burn on the outside before it was done on the inside.  It was way better than I expected. I will make this again.

Very mild in flavor so it would be great to add to lIke others have said. Also good with orange juice instead of milk, add some orange zest and use applesauce instead of oil. I think I will added  a dried fruit like cranberry or blueberries next time.

Delicious! I used an extra cup of oats, melted butter in place of oil, 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and fresh blueberries. Then as another review suggested, I cooled them after baking, cut into bars, and baked again for 5 min to brown all sides. They turned out superb! I will add another 1/4 tsp of cinnamon next time for just a bit more spice.

This is a great recipe for even non-creative cooks like me! 

After reading other reviews, I used 3 cups of oats, 2 tsp cinnamon, and 1-1/2 vanilla extract. I also substituted 1 cup of Sukrin Gold for regular brown sugar, 2 Tbsp Lakanto monk fruit for cane sugar, 1 cup vanilla-flavored almond milk for regular milk, and 2 Tbsp unsweetened applesauce for oil. 

The first time I used the recipe, I cooked the mixture at 350 in an 8x8 dish on top of parchment paper for 30 minutes. Then, I removed it from the dish and sat it directly on the oven rack for 5 minutes. Then, I flipped it and cooked it on the rack for another 5 minutes. (My picture is of this!)

The second time,  I spread it thin in a 10x15 pan and cooked it 30 minutes, removed and cooked both sides on parchment for 5 minutes again. It was much thinner and a little less chewy.

After reading reviews, I used 3c oatmeal, added dried cranberries, 1/4 cup pourable brown sugar (no other sugar), 2 teaspoons vanilla, unsweetened Silk soy milk in place of milk.  Pretty good—allows oatmeal to go. I think will go w 2.5 cups oatmeal next time.

I made the recipe 50% larger so I would have some leftovers. As this recipe is a base, I did make changes: I subbed plain unsweetened almond milk for the dairy milk, and to add protein back to the bars I added two scoops of unflavored protein powder. I added about 2/3 c each frozen blueberries and frozen cranberries, as well as about 2/3 c chopped walnuts.  I did not add the granulated sugar. 

Everyone loved the bars,  The protein powder made them a little grainy and they are very moist, but were definitely a hit.  I will make them again.  The cranberries really made the bars, in my opinion.

This is a great basic baked oatmeal. I added less sugar (3 tablespoons total) and that makes it lightly sweetened. Also added about 1/2 cup dried cranberries. Next time I may add slightly less milk - I think it might work better with 3/4 cup.

I used base recipe and added a half can of pumpkin, a 1/3 c flour, a dash of pumpkin pie spice.  It makes a healthier version of delicious pumpkin bars!  I am making a jelly roll pan full to freeze them.

This basic recipe gave me the perfect foundation to play in the kitchen. After reading all reviews, I decided to only make two modifications-addomg 1 cup of craisins and 1/3 cup sliced almonds. I'm so tickled that I have something that makes my kitchen smell good first thing in the morning that isn't my traditional breakfast of eggs and meat. THANK YOU!!

I made it as directed and added craisins, chocolate peanut butter chips and roasted unsalted nuts. After 25 mins of baking at 350, it was still mushy inside so, I turned the oven off and left the bars inside to finish. The family likes them. (more like cake than bars) Try it and add what you like! Thank you for the recipe.

This is the BASE I've been looking for. 5 stars cuz this is an easy recipe to adjust for your specific diet needs, easy to understand and tastes very good as it is written also.  It was posted sometime ago, and I made changes to it for Gluten Free; Changes include   1C oats, 1C oat flour, 1  15oz can organic unsweetened apple sauce instead of milk, 1/3 + 2T coconut palm sugar instead of commercial granulated sugars, 1/2 t grated nutmeg;  All other ingredients remail the same.  I mix all at same time so not to over mix , if too wet add additional oat flour  1/4c at a time until it oozes (not gooey).  Then add 1 1/2 c dried fruit, end consistency should be gooey like brownie batter.  Bake 10-15 mins. DO NOT over bake.

Absolutely loved this recipe!! 
It  wasn't a super sugary bar, which was perfect for me. I only used brown sugar- in 1/3 cup I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 raw cane sugar. I used evaporated/ canned milk because I prefer the flavour. I added 1/2 cup of raisins and walnuts.  I made this for breakfast this morning and ended up eating the whole dish! Before I placed in oven I also did a light sprinkle of cane sugar on too.

I thought it would be more like granola also, but it was more moist than I thought it would be.  They were ok - not sure if I would try them again.

I will definitely make these again.  I added raisins and walnuts, used walnut oil and increased cinnamon to 1 tsp.  I let the batter rest for 1/2 hour and baked for 33 minutes as they were not quite done at 30 minutes.  Allow to cool before cutting.

Made exactly as directed. Add ins were raisins and chopped walnuts. Came out beautifully! They are best after refrigerating overnight, which gives them some time and the temp to firm up for portability. Perfect on-the-go breakfast. Thanks for the recipe!

Made these this morning, only change was that I added some dry fruit. They were good, but kind of gummy as another reviewer mentioned. Going to add some nut flour & see if that helps. That being said, I will definitely make them again, even if they stay this consistency. They are tasty & quick. I will tinker with them to see if I can make them vegan. I used a pre-divided brownie pan and it worked well. Baked as directed - at 350 for 20 - and had well proportioned servings.

OMG! These are so amazing.  I followed the recipe and added almonds, dried cranberries and dried blueberries. They're so light and I feel like I'm eating something good for me.  I'll grab one or two on my way out the door for work in the morning and I'll make more when I run out

This is really good! Moist, not too sweet, fluffy. I made it in my square pan and it yielded 12 small squares. I will definitely recommend it as a snack if made into the little squares.

I made only one deviation.  I used one egg, because mixture was already soggy.  The final stuff was soft, not as hard as granola bars.  Nevertheless, it is very simple (ingredient wise), tasty, and doesn't require any cooking skill.  I shall make it again.

It was too gooey and I just did not like it. If you picked it up, it broke apart in your hand and I packed it very firm in the baking dish. The bottom was wet and felt nasty. Taste was awful and I ended up throwing the batch away.

This looked lovely, perfect even, in the pan. 
Taste? If you were looking for a pan of oatmeal...this is it.
I wasn't. 
Everyone had a taste, 
spit it out,
 dumped into garbage disposal, 
and made Betty Crocker's old-school oatmeal cookies. And that is the right way to do it.

Very tasty and filling. I added pecans, but any fruit or nuts would work in it. Needs a bit more baking than 30 minutes though.

I usually don't write reviews, but since I research them like crazy for everything, I thought I should be adding some. I made this a couple months ago for a staff meeting and people were raving about them. I did add a little more sprinkle of cinnamon sugar on top at the end - and in one of them I added blueberries. They were delicious. They weren't crisp, which I prefer, but were moist and really delicious and simple! People really loved them. I just googled for the recipe again so I can remake it!

Quite possibly the worst recipe I have ever used. I did not change anything and made 2 separate batches.  Both ended up in the garbage.

These are quite good, particularly for someone who's not a huge fan of oatmeal (but who wants a quick, grab and go breakfast that's also healthy).

Perfect just as is.  I added chocolate chips...Don’t listen to reviews that add less than a cup of milk- I followed their advice and they turned out awful and dry.

just OK. It came out like baked oatmeal, not bars. Not the 'grab and go" breakfast I need.

This is a great Base recipe! So many options. You are only limited  y your imagination! I added almonds and dried cranberries... Making again in a few days I think dried cherries and walnuts..... This has a great texture as well.

1 cup of milk is way too much.  I used less and it was pretty soft.   Not very tasty.

Not the texture I was hoping for, was out of brown sugar so I used pure cane sugar, added dark chocolate chips, cranberries, and cherries.  used less milk also.

I made it with 1/2c of milk as others had suggested and I added 2Tbsp of cacao powder. So good! I like the hint of sweetness and the cake-like texture.

I would add less milk, it was soupy.
