This was very easy to make and tasted great.  I used milk + margarine instead of evaporated milk.  I also added some garlic powder and italian seasonings for flavor.  Didn't have enough shredded cheese so I used a little parmesan.  It turned out great!  I did have to cook it for a little longer than the recipe called for.

My husband despises spinach, but he LOVES this dish. The first time I made it, he turned down a second helping of meat so he could have extra green rice! Like others, I added garlic powder, mixed herbs/italian seasoning, salt and pepper and doubled the amount of cheese.  I also substituted regular milk + butter for the evaporated milk.

This is GREAT! No complaints.Very rich tasting, creamy, not over powered by spinach either. Mine did not turn out one bit dry. I used freash spinach. Cooked spinach in chicken broth instead of plain water. It's a keeper!

This was a fantastic recipe. It did need some salt and pepper, and in my opinion, the one cup of cheese wasn't enough - next time I'll double it. This will be added to my regular rotation!

YUM! I used liquid milk instead of the evaporated (but still 12 oz) and it turned out splendidly! I also added some bits of American cheese along with the cheddar, and extra cheddar cheese. This was delicious!

First off, this should really be called Spinach Rice Casserole as it is a lot like a fave of mine, Broccoli Rice Casserole. Like others, I actually expected green rice for some reason. Definitely needs a good dose of pepper and don't forget the extra cheese. May try again with regular milk instead of evaporated as it wasn't that creamy and maybe add some butter. Oh, and the directions were kinda skimpy.

I used frozen chopped spinach which I thawed for this recipe, since it was quicker.  I would suggest topping this with a butter and bread crumb mixture to make a nice crust.

This recipe was good, but I didn't really like the spinach.  I think next time I make it, I'll omit the spinach and just use broccoli.  Maybe I'll add some more cheese too... it tasted kind of bland to me.  My parents loved it though.  I guess when you get older, you learn to like more stuff.  The recipe was really easy.  Thanks!

Andrea, thanks for adding this recipe! I have been looking for this, as my aunt used to make this for our family gatherings. She is now deceased, and I was pleased to find that this is the same recipe she made! It is wonderful & turned out great!

Good with some doctoring.  I used some cumin and hot peppers to spice it up.  I also used a bit of vegetable stock to cook the rice in.

This was pretty tasty.  I used vegetable broth instead of water to cook rice, and substitued brown rice for white (therefore cooked rice about 30 minutes before mixing in other ingredients and baking).  I also added about 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder and salt & pepper to taste.  I followed other reviewer's suggestions and used milk and butter for evaporated milk.  Baking time suggested was not nearly enough, so I did 30 minutes at 350 degrees and then another 30 minutes at 400 degrees to set and make lightly golden.  Overall, very tasty recipe and great way to sneak in spinach for the kiddies.

This is a good recipe that you can adapt to your liking. For example, I used soya milk with a little margarine instead of the evaporated milk, used brown rice, added a little broccoli, and put in some dried basil, cayenne and garlic powder. My two year old gobbled it up, and my husband and I both liked it too.

I gave it 4 stars only when I added some flavor to it.  The recipe alone has little taste.  I recommend adding some onions or onion powder as well as some salt and pepper.  The second time I've made this was much better with the onion powder, salt, and pepper.  Turned out pretty good!

I made my rice "green" with a can of chopped green chiles instead of spinach.  Also, for added flavor I boiled the rice with chopped onion and garlic, then topped the dish with cheese before baking.  Before serving, I sprinkled freshly diced tomatoes sprinkled on top - that really finished it off.  What a great addition to a Mexican-style meal!

Hmm.  This is okay, but I found it bland--and I added 1 cup more cheese, plenty of salt and pepper, minced garlic and minced onion, and finally, parsley.  I also topped with seasoned breadcrumbs, but it just seemed blah.  Maybe it's just me--it takes a lot to make me like rice, since I've always found it boring, but this just wasn't for me.  Bf, however, seemed to enjoy it well enough.  I think I like this as a side for dishes with sauce to add to the flavor.  I'll compromise with the rating since bf seemed to like it and he's more of a rice fan than me, and the rice directions were spot on and it was ultimately an easy dish to make.   thanks for the recipe!

Wow - we loved this one.  We did use broccoli instead of spinach, only because Hubby had been patient and eaten a fair amount of spinach of late.  So to "give him a break", we used broccoli.  We WILL make it again, and we WILL be using spinach!  Yummy!

The first time I tried this it turned out extremely bland.  I tried it again and added salt and extended the baking time inorder to insure that the spinach is cooked and the egg is set.  Much, much better!  With the above changes it is definitely worth making. Tasty, quick, easy, & cheap.

I used frozen spinach and added fresh broccoli and it was great!  I also doubled the cheese.  It could stand to be a bit creamier, but the taste was spot-on.

This is an excellent recipe -- I loved the texture and the ease of making the dish.  I used all the of the items listed in the recipe (including the condensed milk, which I had never used before). The recipe turned out great -- very solid and delicious.  I added plain bread crumbs to the top of the rice before I baked it and it was a nice touch.  The bread crumbs slightly browned.  I did have to add salt to the dish when it was on my plate.  It tasted a bit bland without the extra salt.  Overall, easy and delcious.

I'm giving this recipe four stars i/o five because:  1) it was very bland and 2) really inadequate directions.  Re: blandness - this good basic recipe would be much better with pepper, salt, garlic and onion powder.  Also, I'll double the cheese next time.  Re: directions - I used frozen chopped spinach (which is the standard way chopped spinach comes) so needed to thaw it beforehand, then drain it.  Also, the egg should be beaten lightly before adding.  The directions just made many assumptions which would torpedo a less-experienced cook.  My only change was to use brown i/o white rice.  Will make again.

Tastes like a dish my mom used to make on Sunday evenings - we called it Green Rice or Rice on the Levy. I added some season panko bread crumbs for a little crunch on top. Could also use crushed Ritz-type crackers. Super suggestion from one of my sisters...let spinach drain overnight in the fridge.

I made some substiutions on this - used parmesan because I had no cheddar.  Used heavy cream and milk instead of the evap. and seasoned the heck out of it.  The flaor was good but it was not creamy at all.  I'll try again with cheddar but it was pretty tasty!  Also, I had to cook mine 45 mins.

We really liked this dish. the only thing I would recommend is a little salt and a dash of pepper. We also added a little extra cheese. The recipe instructions are for regular rice, not quick cooking, so if you use quick cooking, go by it's directions. :)

Made it with double the cheese and evaporated milk.  Will try it with some chicken, milk, butter, & more cheese next time.  Good though!

I must agree with several of the other reviews; I found the dish rather bland.  I even made a few slight adjustments and still had the same feeling.  I used fresh spinach and sauteed it slightly in olive oil with garlic, salt, pepper, and italian seasoning before adding it to the rice mixture.  I still felt that there wasn't enough flavor and it wasn't as creamy as I was expecting.

We didn't care for this at all. I followed the recipe, using frozen spinach. It needed SALT or pepper or something with flavor. I added 1t. of salt to the mix but we still salted it at the table. The texture was kind of strange and the spinach was overpowering. Unfortunately, all that was left went in the garbage. It just wasn't good to us.

I made this as a side to thanksgiving dinner. Everyone raved about it. The  only change I made was to use fresh spinach in place of the frozen. I will be making this again! Thanks!

This is good, sort of a savory rice pudding. Like other reviewers, I used regular milk with 1 T. butter. This recipe was blatantly lacking in spices. I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder - essential additions.

Delicious & easy! based on other reviews I added 2 cloves fresh garlic & 1/4 t. pepper. And I used what I had on hand: skim milk & butter, not evaporated, all Parmesan cheese & 9 oz. of fresh spinach in a bag. It is a really good spinach gratin rice side dish, great with a steak & salad. Thanks!

Definately needs salt and pepper.  My kids did not like it at all.  My husband and I liked it after adding hotsauce to make it less bland.  For some reason, I was expecting "green" rice, but it's ok that the rice wasn't green.  I will make this again.  Maybe more flavor would be added if I cooked the rice in chicken broth instead of water. (For every 1 cuo rice - cook with two cups water) This was missing in the instructions. I also added cooked ground beef when the rice was done.

I thought this recipe sounded promising, and I followed the suggestions of adding salt, more cheese etc.  No one liked it, even my husband who will usually eat anything.  Don't know what to do to improve it, so I guess it's just not for us.

I used brown basmati rice and my spinach was a 12 oz package, which may be why mine turned out a little dry. We added salt at the table, and next time I think I'll add more milk, some butter and either use more cheese, or sharp instead of medium cheddar. Makes a lot.

I added a tsp fresh minced garlic because I just couldn't imagine leaving it out :) and I sprinkled some of the cheese over the top thinking it would make a crust but it didn't really, and it really didn't need it. Other than that I just followed the recipe. Delicious! Even the kids loved it.

I changed this recipe quite a bit based upon other reviews.  Seems it would have been pretty bland if done only as directed.  What I ended up with was fantastic.  I added Herbs de Provence an additional cup of cheese and cooked the rice in chicken broth.  Definitely a keeper!

This is a good recipe. I did double the cheese and added about 1/2 of a cup to the top which made it very good. I gave it 4 stars b/c I thought it would be creamier. I'll make it again though! I did add salt too and thought it even needed more after I started eating it.

I pretty much followed this recipe to the letter, though guestimated on the cheese, and found it pretty bland.  I would make it again, but add some garlic salt, pepper, and more cheese (which could have been my error in the first place). I would maybe also consider cooking the rice in a chicken broth, or vegetable broth...something to give it a bit more flavor.

This was not a very good side dish at all.  Very dry after baking.  No flavor even though I added some spices to try to up the flavor and cooked the rice in chicken broth.  Just bland and a lot of ingredients and work for just rice.  I would have preferred just plain rice.

Kinda plain tasting to me, but my boyfriend loved it so... I did change it up a little too though. I used mozzarella and fontina cheese instead which I would have thought would be something for more flavor.

I should have followed the reviews on the seasoning. I was going to but I forgot. It was a bit bland. I would have added salt, garlic powder, & pepper. It was still very good and I could see the potential with this recipe. I'll try it again.

I did enjoy this recipe but you must spice it up a notch for most I think. A little to plain for my taste.  I also used real milk which will make for longer cooking time but it is a good dish when you main course is strong in taste and flavor.

I made this as a side dish for salmon and it was delicious!  I did have to add a little salt though but other family members thought it was fine without salt.

I really liked this recipe.  I topped it with extra cheese and browned it with the broiler once it was set.  Also added salt and pepper, and garlic powder.

My ( now ex-husband) husband was telling me about "green rice" he use to love when he was little.  I found this recipe and gave it a shot.  He loved it.  I have made it several times and it has always turned out perfect.  Definetly a keeper!  He wasn't....hahaha
