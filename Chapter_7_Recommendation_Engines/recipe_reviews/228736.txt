This cookie has a chewy, rustic texture.  It’s not too sweet and bakes up attractively, nice and round.  I had no issues with the cookie flattening although, as I always do with a butter-based cookie dough, I chilled the dough until somewhat firm before baking.  I substituted cinnamon chips for the chocolate chips and, truth be told, I prefer them here as the combination of chocolate and cinnamon never much appealed to me. Hubs and I both agree, however, that the cookie was a little heavy on the chips and on the oats.  I’m thinking less oats (or a little more flour) and maybe even a tad more sugar would make these softer and a little more moist.

The balance of sugar and oats is just right in this recipe; however, they turned out to be just a bit too crunchy at 375 for 9 minutes. I turned the oven down to 350, baked them for 8 minutes, and they were PERFECT - very lightly toasted around the edges and soft and chewy on the inside.

I made the recipe exactly as directed and every single person who had one wanted more. I used sweet creamery butter since the recipe has both salt and baking soda and I didn't want the cookies to be too salty. The cinnamon really gives it a depth of character other oatmeal cookies just don't have. These cookies are soft, chewy and just delicious. Thank you for posting!

Perfect.  I'm a very novice baker and these still turned out great!  Don't forget the pinch of salt since it is listed in the ingredients but not in the directions.  I didn't change anything in the recipe.

Very good.  I found that  baking for 9 minutes at 375 made them more brown than I prefer (another reviewer said the same thing), so I lowered the temp to 350 and baked for only 8 minutes and that was perfect.   I also smashed them down a bit, because they don't really spread out much. I followed the recipe exactly (except for I omitted cinnamon, because I don't like that in with chocolate), except when it came to add-ins.  I added an extra cup of chocolate chips, and in half of the dough, I also added raisins and nuts. Just personal preference.  The only reason I didn't rate it a 5, was because of the temperature and time.

My family kind of whined when I said I was making oatmeal cookies but as soon as they took a bite they  each grabbed another cookie! I made exactly as written except just a few less chocolate chips. I halved the recipe and it made about  13 jumbo sized cookies. I would make little smaller next time as it bakes it into a flat cookie. Mine too was crispy around the edges - perfect!

I made a few changes to this recipe and they made me feel a little better about how many I'm sure to eat! I halved the recipe and used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. I also added flax seeds to the sifted dry ingredients before adding them to the butter mixture. The combination of those two changes and the old-fashioned oats makes these a delicious, healthier treat (and you can't taste anything strange--in fact, the seeds add a yummy nutty flavor that goes well with the cinnamon). I also baked them at 350 for about 10 mins, and flattened them a bit before putting them in the oven.

Wonderful cookie recipe! The cinnamon gives it an added flavor to distinguish these from most chocolate chip cookies.  I substituted half the butter with butter-flavored shortening so the cookies wouldn't bake too thin, as I read other reviewers state.  Flattening before baking at 350 for ten minutes, they came out perfect...not too flat, but not like a cake, either.  The outside was lightly crisp, while the inside was soft and chewy. Will definitely be making these again!

Delicious!  Definitely adding to my recipe book.   Very quick and easy to make and I love the cinnamon.  After reading some of the other reviews I will try raisins as an alternate.  Best oatmeal cookie I have found yet...Thanks!

Yum yum, is all I can say. I used whole wheat flour and added chopped walnuts.  It was chewy on the inside with a crunchy outside. A new staple cookie in my house also. Had to bake for 15 min and did use the parchment paper.

Quite possibly the best recipe for oatmeal chocolate chip cookies I have ever tried!!! I used white chocolate and semi sweet chips, kosher salt, and I didn't have parchment but they came out perfect. Mine took every second of 10 minutes and they came out perrrrrfect! Actually, besides the tray I made up for a neighbor, daddy will be lucky if there are some left by the time he gets homes!

It's a winner!  This recipe was exactly what I was looking for, more oatmeal cookie than just a chocolate chip cookie with oatmeal.  I did think three cups of oatmeal was too much though, two cups was just right for us.  After adding the oatmeal the dough was very dry looking, I can't imagine a third cup!  As always, I used my mix of half white flour with half whole wheat instead of just white flour.  My only other change was using a tad less white sugar.  They were perfectly sweet, for us, and we like sweet. For my second batch, I substituted golden raisins pre-soaked in water since I'm not a big chocolate fan and they were also super good!  Eight minutes at 325 degrees in my convection oven worked perfect for me, the first batch I made at 350 for 9 minutes were a bit too browned and crunchy.  Like another reviewer said, don't worry that the middle still looks a little uncooked, ours ended up just soft in the center, not undercooked.  This one is saved to my recipe box and going in my recipe binder! Thank you!

I added 1/2 bag semi sweet chocolate chips in addition to 1 bag milk chocolate chips, as I had extra. SO delicious. My husband said they are better than Potbelly's cookies. I made them as bars, same temp, cooked for 28 minutes. Awesome.

Perfect, perfect cookies :) 
I took other posting recommendations and baked on 350 for 8 minutes and that was great advice.

I added raisins, dried cranberries and chopped walnuts.  I also used dark chocolate chips because that is what I had on hand but not a whole 12 oz bag.  I just eyeballed the amount of chocolate and the other added ingredients.
They came out amazing!

I used steel cut oats which I soaked in water for 15 minutes in place of regular oats. The cookies did turn out soft and had a nice flavor, but (maybe due to the cut of the oats) it seemed like there were just too many oats. I would use 2 or 2.5 cups of steel cut oats if I bake this again.

Made these cookies several times, always great. Only changes I made were slightly less chocolate chips (3/4 bag) and I added walnuts. Delicious every time.

Absolutely perfectly delicious cookie. I don't make cookies very often, but when I feel the urge, I will definitely lean towards this recipe!

I made these but cut the oatmeal in half.  I had doubled the recipe and made BIG cookies...they turned out awesome.  I also added part peanut butter chips to them and omitted the cinnamon.  I will make them again!

Followed the recipe meticulously. Appealing soft texture with a subtle crisp exterior. Bakes nicely. Pronounced cinnamon flavor. The combination of cinnamon and chocolate is, to me, unpleasant. But the failure here is with the amount of salt called for. I am very sensitive to the taste of salt in both savory and sweet foods, preferring much less than  commonly called for. Not in this case! Salt is necessary. You don't bite into a cookie and expect it to be salty, but you should taste a hint of it. Not only is "1 pinch salt" poor instruction in a cookie recipe, (Because when making a cookie there's no opportunity to correct the seasoning to taste, is there?) it's not nearly enough to highlight the flavor of the chocolate or balance the cookie in any way. You'll need at least 1/2 teaspoon. I compared this recipe to several similar oatmeal-chocolate chip recipes, and those called for 1 teaspoon of salt. The lack of salt and the combo of cinnamon and chocolate resulted in a cookie so awful I tossed the whole batch into the garbage can.

I thought that 3 cups of Oats would be  too much so I reduced the amount to two cups. However I could tell the batter was still too wet. I put the full 3 cups in. These cookies turned out delicious, I wouldn't change a thing and will definitely make again

Glad I read a review with a reminder to let the batter chill to avoid fallen cookies and another to cut back on the oats (I used 2 cups vs 3 cups). I also used silicone mats and got nice thick but soft cookies. Did one batch on a foil lined pan and got pancake cookies even though the dough was chilled. Tasty though--would make again.

Best oatmeal chocolate chips cookies I have had.  Soft, moist, and chewy.  My husband can't stop talking about how much he and his co workers loved them.

Ok, I'll admit I forgot the cinnamon. Other than that, I made the batter exactly as directed, then I baked them at 350. Cook time needed on my oven ended up being 13 minutes. Great cookie! hearty but soft and yummy. Definitely will make them again!

I followed this recipe exactly.  The cookies are good, but next time I'll cut down on the oats.  These cookies were a little too "oaty" for me.  But overall a very good recipe!

Good basic recipe!  Used this to teach my son how to make his own cookies.  We split the batch in two, half with M&M's and half with white and dark chocolate chips.

These were delicious! I used virgin coconut oil, instead of butter, and I used half semi-sweet chocolate chips & half butterscotch chips. Could possibly use fewer chips, but otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing.

I conquered this recipe last night and I am so grateful for it! My partner ate 5 and I did too! I substituted unsalted butter for salted instead of adding a dash of salt. The dough is so spectacular due to the oats it bakes so well that you can make them large (I did 3 tbsp ea.). If you like less spicy cookies I would lower your cinnamon to a 1/2 tsp. These are very sweet and moist cookies. Thank you!

Excellent and golden brown. Chewy and not overly sweet, I used sugar free Hershey's chocolate chips). One change I made after the first batch, was by dropping a TEASPOON of dough onto the cookie sheet, because the cookies were way to big and wet in the center if I used a tablespoon or two as called for in the recipe. Also, do not grease the cookie sheet! Will definitely make these again, yummy!

I made this couple of weeks ago and love them. I had used a little less sugar as recommended in the recipes because I didn't want the cookies to come out too sweets. They came out awesome! The best part is that after a week, the cookies were still crispy on the outside and chewy inside. I'm planning to make it again this week for my mom.

My boyfriend is beside himself with how amazing these cookies are. I doubled the cinnamon because I really wanted it to stick out. The result is perfect! The flavors are subtle and all work well together. These cookies aren't the ones that are going to leave you feeling gross and in pain. Can't wait to make again!

I am not a baker but any means. Somehow these cookies turned out perfect. I halved the recipe for a smaller batch and used a little less oats and almond extract instead of vanilla. Perfection!

Made exactly as written. These are too dry.  Maybe the amount of oatmeal is off because these came out like sawdust and not very flavourful.

Really good cookies! After the first batch, I took the suggestion of another reviewer and turned the temp to 350, baking for 12-13 mins and they were better. The cookies were delicious! But want to make them thicker. Ideas on how to do that are appreciated. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was alright.  375 was definitely too high of a temperature to cook the cookies at.  The first batch I did at that temp, and they nearly burned.  I lowered the temp to 350 and baked for about 13-14 minutes a tray and they came out much better.  I would also would recommend cutting back the butter a bit, and perhaps increasing the flour and reducing the oats a bit.

These are AMAZING!  I wasn't reading the directions well and added a full cup of white sugar when making, so I HAD to double the recipe.  I only had 1 bag of chocolate chips.  I did have a bag of butterscotch chips so I used those for the doubling... OMG!  So good and soft.  They kept for several weeks in the fridge as my family slowly devoured a few each night until Christmas!
