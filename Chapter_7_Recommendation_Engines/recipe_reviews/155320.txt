Being from Quebec, I've tried many sugar pie recipes and this one's definitely a winner!  I made the recipe with no changes and my whole family raved about it on New Year's day.  My mother, who's French Canadian, and has been making sugar pies all her life asked for the recipe!

I grew up in Montreal, Quebec.  I have tasted more Tarte au Sucre than I can possibly say...  This is by far the best and easiest one.   Small pieces though!  It's lethally sweet! (and that is a good thing!)

Oh this was soooo decadent. Real vanilla extract is the key to the delicious taste.  Mix the sugar, flour and salt very well before adding to the wet ingredients (I used a pastry blender).  Remember to add the sugar mixture slowly to the wet, mixing well so that the sugar dissolves. I love the fact that the recipe does not require butter as so many others do.  To get this pie right, you'll need to remove it from the oven as soon as the custard is set.  I used the oven directions as directed (10 minutes at 400, 40 minutes at 350) and it was perfect.  My mother was Acadian, and her recipe could not match this one. My husband and I love it. Update...for those who have texture issues this pie should be mixed slowly and thoroughly. The sugar needs to be completely dissolved. The texture should be similar to pecan pie...smooth and custard-like.

Being from Indiana, we have an affinity for sugar cream pies. While on this web site I came across this version. This is not anything like Mrs. Wicks Sugar cream pie, BUT I would say it is fantastic! This will become one of our family pies for the holidays and we will place it next to the old English cr√®me and Indiana Sugar cream pies. LOVE IT!

Tasty pie, though parts of it came out a little too gelatinous in texture. Maybe I should have taken it out of the oven earlier? I also wonder why the recipe calls for 2 eggs + 1 yolk. If I ever make this again, I might save myself the trouble and just use 3 full eggs. I didn't make the thick cream, but the pie is sweet enough on its own.

An exceptional recipe for such a traditional pie. The thick cream helps cut the sweetness of the pie.

I have been making this pie for years.  The person who gave me the recipe called it a brown sugar pie.  Whenever I take this pie to a potluck someone always asks for the recipe.  We have an annual soup & salad luncheon at church and someone told me they don't care about the soups they come for my brown sugar pie.

I made two pies - For the first one I followed the recipe and used the lighter brown sugar. With the second pie I experimented a little, mixed one cup dark brown sugar and one cup light, and substituted heavy cream for the evaporated milk. Both pies are absolutely delicious.  I used store bought pastry.
