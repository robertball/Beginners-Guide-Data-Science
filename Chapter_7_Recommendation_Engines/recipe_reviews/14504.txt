Trust me, you will not miss the meat in this sandwich!  I also broiled my veggies because of the snow outside on top of the grill.  The only veggie I added was green pepper only because I had one.  I will use a large red onion next time because we love the carmelized flavor of the onion under the broiler. I also sprayed my veggies with balsamic vinegar for some extra "zip". Served the veggies on hearty multi-grain rolls from Whole Foods - - use the best bread possible because it truly will make or break the sandwich.  Excellent recipe, Heather!!

This was quite possibly the best sandwich I've ever had (my hubby said the same thing).  We put it in italian-seasoned focaccia and after the veggies were done (we grilled them on a gas grill), we assembled the sandwich and wrapped in foil and put in a 350F oven for 20 minutes.  Incredible.  I want another one already.  For us, this made 2 very large sandwiches.  UPDATE: we've made these about once every other week and we still haven't gotten sick of them.  Make sure and make the sauce about ahead of time and let it sit for about an hour in the fridge to mix the flavors well.

It was a little confusing about how to slice the foccacia bread and why the recipe serves 4 when the instructions seem only to make 2 sandwiches. 

But nonetheless, I winged it and like the other reviewers said, it was terrific.  My vegetarian friend I made it for really liked it.  

Next time I'll cook the vegies in foil wrap to save on turning and watching so much.  Will also add portabello mushrooms.

This was absolutely delicious!! One serving filled me up. We grilled the veggies on a tin foil platter sprayed with olive oil and it worked great. We grilled them for 7 minutes a side also to make sure the onions were soft and a bit carmelized. (We don't like them raw.) Try it!!

Just made this for a few neighbors with some slight changes and everyone was asking me to make it again for them and they would buy the ingredients! I added portabella mushrooms and eggplant. Marinated the veggies and did as others suggested, roasting them on foil. Added pesto and sun dried tomatoes to the aoli sauce.
Great!!!

Wow, now this is veggie heaven! What a fabulous sandwich that's not only bursting with vibrant colors but it's also bursting with a lot of flavor! Grilling the veggies really gives it a nice smoky quality that tastes great. I added a bit of garlic, rosemary, thyme, fresh lemon juice, kosher salt, and cracked black pepper to the olive oil to baste the veggies while grilling. I also grilled some thick sliced tomato along with the other veggies and opted for some mild cheddar cheese vs. feta. This was great on focaccia and I'd love to experiment with other types of bread - this recipe is a definite keeper!

This was really good.  I had some doubts, even after reading all of the other positive reviews, because I didn't know how well my meat-eating, preponderantly male family would take to an all-veggie sandwich.  They loved it - and so did I.  I only had minced garlic, so I roasted some of that in a glass dish in my toaster oven for the aioli.  I used sliced red and green bell peppers, zucchini, fresh sliced mushroom, tomatoes and carmelized onions for my vegetables.  I didn't have rosemary, so I just used dried basil and parsley instead.  I used Monterey Jack cheese and used English muffins as my base - yum!  I'll definitely, definitely be making these again.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was great!  I have never made anything like this before, but my mother was coming over for dinner and is a mostly vegetarian.  I found this and will make it again and again.  I was a bit confused about the slicing part, but I winged it and sliced it sideways, then layered the sandwich and cut it in wedges.  It was perfect.  I didn't use all of the dressing, just enough to moisten the bread.  It was easy and tasty.  I served some fruit on the side and had a wonderful summer dinner.  Thanks for sharing, Heather!

This was absolutely fantastic!  I also grilled some tomatoes and asparagus and everyone took what they liked for their own sandwich. I doubled the garlic mayo (aioli) the 2nd time I made it since 1/4 cup didn't go far enough in my house. A nice plus to this recipe, after the meal, we all felt "full" but not "heavy" and it gave me energy, as my usual sandwich of pbj doesn't seem to do! LOL

A great recipe to serve if you are having a vegetarian over for dinner.  Very tasty and easy.  We grilled all the veggies in a grill basket on the bbq, instead of individually on the grill.  I couldn't find yellow squash and substituted eggplant instead.  Very yummy indeed...

This was great!  I roasted the veggies at 450 for 20-25 minutes and broiled for 5 minutes.  I broiled the bread for a few minutes as well as we don't have a grill.  It was fantastic.

Wasn't sure how a veggie sandwich would go over with my carnivore loving family, but they loved it. This sandwich was a beautiful presentation of colors and flavors that looked and tasted wonderful. I added garlic and minced onion to the olive oil for basting and based on other reviews, I increased the amount of aioli and am so glad I did as there wouldn't have been enough for us.  Thank you Heather for such a wonderful surprise.

I baked, "Michael's Foccacia Bread," from this website, which is VERY good by the way. To begin with I made the dressing and marianted for an hour to let the ingredients marry. I sliced the red bell peppers and red onions into ringlets. I sliced the zucchini and yellow squash, lengthwise, in strips, from the top down. I brushed oil on each vegetable and placed it on the grill to cook. Within 3 minutes I had nice dark grill marks on the vegetables and they appeared to get soft so I flipped it over to cook the other side. I placed the bottom half of the bread onto the grill to heat it up. I did the same with the top half only I placed it cutside down first to get it heated and toasted up nicely. I spread a little of the dressing onto the bread, sprinkled it with the feta cheese and layered the vegetables on each sandwich. The ingredients, vegetables and the dressing amount is enough to fill exactly four "good size" foccacia sandwiches. This is absolutely delicious! The dressing is just perfect. The lemon juice and garlic work well in the mayonnaise-nothing is too "tangy" or "oily". The foccacia bread tastes great because it is freshly baked, tasty and has fresh herbs baked right into it! With all the grilled vegetables layered on this, I feel good knowing I ate healthy. The vegetables are only seasoned with olive oil, nothing more, and tastes sweet. This is a very satisfying, healthy and fulfilling meal. Even the meat lover's in my family didn't miss the meat. Love it!

Delicious! But I put my own twist on it, given the current circumstances. It was winter, so I sauteed the veggies instead. I'm sure I used some different veggies as well. Feta was expensive so I used a different kind of cheese, I can't even remember what kind it was, sorry that isn't very helpful. But they were delicious and I received lots of compliments on them! Will make again! And I have used the mayo/garlic/lemon juice blend on other things.

Great recipe! My husband was skeptical of a sandwich with only grilled vegetables but he liked it. I've tried it with goat cheese and with feta and my personal opinion is to stick with the feta! I sliced the veggies into long horizontal slices (instead of the circles like in the picture) so they'd fit in the sandwich better.

This is my husband and my FAVORITE meal from this website.  We eat meat, but would trade for this sandwich any day.  It is super tasty.  We grill on a George Forman grill, and use a toaster oven for the bread.

these are good, but i just can't rate them 5 stars. good, but they didn't blow my mind. several recommendations: double the spread, as others have noted. i love feta, but other cheese choices might go over better. when you grill the veggies, slice thin! next time, i might follow another suggestion listed here, and use thinner bread slices and assemble the sandwich, wrap it up, put it on the grill, and put a brick on top. my guests just ate the veggie and bread/feta seperately. still good though! i'll never stop grilling veggies after this.

Amazing! I added portabellos roasted with balsamic vinegar and seasoning. And also added capers to the mayo(i always use miracle whip light instead). The bread can be sliced in half easily instead of this being open faced.

This was fantastic! You definitely won't miss the meat here.   I cooked the veggies on the griddle and sprinkled a tiny bit of salt on them to bring out the juices.   I also substituted Brie for Feta and toasted the sandwich in the oven to melt the Brie and give the bread a nice crispiness to it. Will definitely be making this again!

I'm trying to get my parents to eat more vegetarian meals and boy did they love this! I couldn't find focaccia bread, but used a garlic cheese sourdough and it was excellent! Definitely worth a try even if your not a vegetarian!

This deserves 5 stars because of its potential.  The meal was delicious, even the carnivores loved it.  I will make a few changes in the future though... Instead of toasting the bread on the grill with the cheese side up, I will put it under the broiler so the cheese side is grilled instead.  The sandwich was so crunchy that when you bight down, the filling falls out.  Portobello mushrooms are a must and I recommend marinating the vegetables in a red wine vinegar in advance.  Overall- wonderful and I can see this being a staple in my weekly meals.  Thank you!

Truly and awesome sandwich, I made everything according to the original recipe, with the exception of adding two extra cloves of garlic and reserved some of the sauce for dipping.  Wouldn't change a thing.

This is a superb sandwich!  I made it just as the recipe states except no peppers (i don't like 'em).  And it was great!  On person even said it was the best sandwich he ever had!  It will become a regular recipe for my grill.

It was okay but there was a bit too much garlic. I recommend only using 1.5 - 2 cloves.

So good! The first time I made it I had used goat cheese. Mistake. The other times, I used grated parmesan cheese. Yum. Also used Costco's ciabatta rolls. Poured some oil on cookie sheet, spread thin with a paper towel. Put the veges on pan. Put a thin layer of a balsamic glaze (Costco online) on veges. Broiled on second level from top, about 5 min. Flipped, added another thin layer of balsamic glaze. Baked another 5 min. FYI- I put the onion on a separate cookie sheet and broiled first; then took it out and put the vege cookie sheet in it's place; at the same time I then put the onion cookie sheet back in the oven, but on the rack below the veges.  (To keep warm and cook a little more.)

I LOVE LOVE LOVE these. The best thing about spring is I can start making these again on our grill!  I usually just use french bread because I can't find focaccia.  Also omit the onions.  I can't wait to make these again!! I would give this ten stars if I could!

This was SO GOOD - even my husband (who thinks he has to have meat at every meal) loved it.  I added artichokes, and will try mushrooms next time. Thanks for sharing this recipe - it is now a family favorite.

Delicious! I did make some changes because I didn't have all the ingredients. I used red pepper, onion, portabello mushrooms, goat cheese and grilled Italian turkey sausage. I definitely recommend marinating the veggies in olive oil, balsamic, fresh rosemary and a dash of sea salt. Also. the more red pepper you use, the better!

So good! The lemon-garlic mayo really makes it awesome! We "grilled" everything on our panini press and used ciabatta instead and it was a hit. Will definitely be in regular rotation for dinners!

Please make these. You will not regret it! Not only are they so delicious, but they make for such a colorful, gorgeous meal. THE quintessential summer recipe! I grilled all the above veggies also adding tomato and basted with a mixture of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, s&p, thyme, rosemary, and garlic as others suggested (DO this! Gives the veggies awesome flavor). I used tomato basil foccacia and after spreading with the mayo and sprinkling w/ feta, I put the foccacia slices on the grill for several minutes then piled the veggies over the top and served open faced w/ my roasted corn salad on the side. WOW! So, so good and such presentation for company! Thanks for this recipe...My family will be making these ALOT during the summer! :)

So Good! made this tonight, and it was very simple and very delicious. I wasn't expecting much, considering I hate every single vegetable on here, but I LOVED it. Even my anti-vegetarian broher loved it. I doubled the recipe, and it was still good, but if you don't really like garlic, then I would cut back on that a bit (it can have a strong flavour) Would definitely make this again! P.S. It only cost me $12 to make this for my family of six!

The dressing for this was simple but very flavorful. Overall this was a really good sandwich, but you might want to scoop out the inside of at least one side of the bread so everything doesn't just fall apart like it did for me. I followed the recipe as described, but "grilled" veggies on my George Foreman.

This recipe made fantastic sandwiches!  We didn't have a yellow squash, but we used some portobellos marinated in olive oil and balsamic vinegar, then grilled and sliced.  The lemon-garlic mayo was really great (try to make it a day ahead, though, it's much better after having had a chance to blend).  Good w/ pesto mayo, too.  What flavor!!  One of my favorites

This a fantastic lunch or light dinner.  I served with cajun potatoe wedgies and lemonade for a wonderful summer dinner.  The aioli and feta add enough flavor to eat without dressing.

FANTASTIC! Served on "Easiest Focaccia Bread" recipe from this site (with added parmesan).  In addition to the feta, sliced smoked gruyere was melted onto the bread.  Added sliced Portabello mushrooms to the grilled veggies.  Served the sandwiches buffet-style, so the kids could pick what veggies they liked.  I added sliced tomatoes, capers, black olives and kalamata olives to the options.  A little balsamic vinaigrette over the top of the veggies made it out of this world!  I will be making these again and again!

I'm definitely in the minority here, but I didn't care for this and won't make it again. However.... The mayo/lemon/garlic combination was great, and I will definitely use that on something else in the future.

I was unable to find foccacia at my bakery, so I used Italian multi grain bread. I also do not have a grill, so I followed the advice of other users and broiled instead. I coated the vegetables in the oil and broiled them 3 minutes on each side. I then broiled the bread to melt the cheese.  I may have over broiled slightly, but the sandwich was still very good. I imagine it is outstanding with the foccacia! Great way to work in some veggies. Thanks for the recipe.

Awesome sandwich! Our grill is under a foot of snow right now so I had to grill the veggies in the oven, but they turned out perfectly. Also, instead of melting the cheese before adding the veggies, I assembled everything together with another piece of bread on top and then pressed the entire sandwich in a panini press. Sooooo good! The only other change I made was using yellow peppers instead of squash. Still tasted amazing!

Really tasty! Great the second day too. Added chicken the second time for more protein. Grilled the chicken first, then combined it with the veggies and poured over the mayo. Fabulous!

This was a great sandwich, even my husband, who doubted it due to it being vegetarian, loved it!  The only change I made was add some garlic pepper to the olive oil that I brushed the veggies with.  I had to use my George Foreman grill because I was out of propane and it still turned out great!

I've made this sandwich several times and my family is always happy to see it on the menu. I bake all my veggies in the oven for about 20 minutes, assemble on the bread and sprinkle shaved or shredded Parmesan cheese over it. The baked veggies are good as a side dish too if you don't want to make sandwiches with them. I promise you won't miss the meat!

I made this "sammy" two ways. The first time following the directions to a T. The second time, I replaced the garlic/lemon/mayo with "simple garlic and basil pesto" from this site. I enjoyed the pesto much more. Either way, this is a great sandwich! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made some small changes. I roasted the garlic in my toaster oven for the mayo. I couldn't grill since its winter so I cooked all the veggies on the stove in garlic flavored EVOO and threw in some premade Tyson grilled chicken and used jarred roasted sweet red peppers. I also threw the feta into the pan so it would get a little melty. And I put it all into a Spinach wrap with Alfalfa Sprouts. It was super yummy I will make this often with many variations. It would be great with quartered cherry tomatoes and my husband wants to try it with cucumbers as well.

I didn't know if this would be my thing, but I can now say that this is *THE BEST RECIPE* on the site. I would recommend these minor additions: portobello mushrooms (essential, esp. for meat eaters) and zucchini. We had to use the oven due to rain, but I let the peppers cook longer and finished them off under the broiler. Perfection! You MUST try this. ;)

This is fantastic.  I make it all the time, summer and winter.  My husband loves to grill and as a vegetarian it gets a little boring.  This sandwich is one of my favorites and is loved by everyone who has tried it.  We have this great flavored focaccia bread at our grocery store that tastes great with the rest of the ingredients.  Thanks so much for submitting this one!

Made this for my vegetarian friend this summer -- she loved it.  My meat eating friends didn't like it as much... one picked out some of the vegies.  It also didnt' seem like enough food for some hearty eaters.

FInding kids that like vegetables can be hard... I made this on homemade bread, instead of foccaccia, and it was wonderful.  Takes times to cut the veggies, but it was a great dish served with other grilled veggies.  Hooray for vegetarian grilling!

Absolutely fantastic! Perfect example of how a little effort goes a very long way. Like some other reviewers, we grilled these on foil. I also added grilled tomatoes, and balsamic vinegar to the olive oil. EXCELLENT!

Yum-O!  Added a few different veggies and served on fresh homemade focaccia.  Very similar to the eggplant sandwiches on this site, which are a favorite of ours.  I'll definitely make again!

If I could give more stars I would! My family LOVES this sandwich! My 15yr old sister was literally skipping to the table, squealing, when I called the family in for dinner. The store didn't have focaccia, so I used ciabatta instead and no one noticed a difference. I broil the veggies (it's winter right now) and when they start to get crispy around the edges I know they're perfect! Oh, I also use both a red and a sweet onion(if I can find them both). So good served with a lighter soup!

This sandwhich is like a party in my mouth! As a person who eats vegetarian meals 2-3 times a week, this is fast and simple! To add a meatier taste, I add portabello mushroom slices and black beauty eggplant to the mix! Just divine!

Even my meat lovers were shocked by this and asked for it again!  I followed the recipe with different veg: zucchini, portabello for a meaty texture, red onion, and asparagus.  For the cheese I sliced mozzarella and let it melt into the ciabatta bread in the oven just before serving.  The sauce was great, but I like more flavor so I added a few seasonings and some capers with juice, using half the recommended mayo in fat free, then half sour cream.  We will enjoy this again.

LOVED this. Didn't have yellow squash, so I subbed in some grilled mushrooms. SO delicious! Even my carnivorous husband liked it! Just like a restaurant! Will definitely make again.

This is such an awesome sandwich! With meat prices so high and summer vegetables in season, it is such a money saver, too! I am not vegetarian but live on a budget and this is an awesome sandwich for healthiness and cost effective. I would give one word of warning, if you have a cheap charcoal grill like mine, the bread will burn before you melt the cheese. It warms and melts fine on my george foreman and would probably work fine if you have a grill you can lower the heat and flame. Thank you for the awesome recipe!

This sandwich was absolutely wonderful. Used rosemary foccaccia for the bread, and it was lovely and crispy. A healthy and delicious summer meal. Served with A Twist on Pasta Salad for an easy and delicious meal. Thanks!

We loved this open-faced sandwich.  We aren't big fans of squash, so I left off the squash and zucchini and used sliced portobello mushrooms instead.

Yum!  These are delicious!  Next time I won't use so much red onion and may add portabella mushrooms but that's just my personal preference.  Excellent recipe!

This is AMAZING.

I made the sauce first and let it sit in the fridge while I made the rest of the meal.  I added portabella mushrooms for my fiance's sandwich since he loves them.  The store I went to did not have the bread, so I bought a different artisian bread (whole grain boulle). After the veggies were grilled, I spread the sauce on each piece of bread and covered one side with basil tomato feta and placed on the grill to toast the bread and warm the cheese then stacked veggies and topped with the other piece of bread.  AWESOME.  This is sooo full of flavor and is very filling. You won't miss the meat!  I HIGHLY recommended and also definitely recommend adding feta.

Wonderful recipe! It was so easy to make and the flavor was fantastic.  I used whole wheat hogie rolls to make the sandwiches.  Very filling but doesn't make you feel heavy.  Will definately make this again...and again...and again.

My husband, daughter and I love this recipe.  I've made it quite a few times now and we never get tired of it.  It reminds me of something you would get at a quaint bistro.

This is a really wonderful recipe! I do recommend to double the mayo,garlic, lemon sauce. I used an 8" round focaccia, cut it in half and thinned it out. I then spread the mayo mix on both halves, stacked the veggies and cheese, put the top on, wrapped in tin foil, then baked for about 20 min. in a 350 degree oven. My boyfriend wasn't overly excited about a "veggie sandwich" for dinner, but he ended up loving it!

Delicious. As per another's advice, I added a bit of balsamic vinegar to the veggies before broiling, plus one lone piece of portabella cap, and I did the veggies for 7 minutes on each side to allow the onion to caramelize a bit. Too good :)  Also, I used a whole wheat roll cut in half to make two open-faced meals, and only slathered one side with both the aioli & the cheese; the other had only aioli. Verdict: the original recipe (both) is much yummier :) It adds a creaminess and comfort-food element that's sublime. (I can't eat feta but I used goat cheese and it was divine together.) :)  I'm looking for veggie first-courses that will wean me from meat, and I'm not (unfortunately) very easy to please. But this'll work for sure. I can't wait to make it next--it's takes five seconds to prepare and it hits the spot. Thank you!

Excellent!  I marinated them in a bit a balsamic vinegar, garlic powder, salt & pepper for a few hours before I put them on the grill.  I also dressed the bread with a sundried tomato mayonnaise.

I have made this recipe as written (and not) many, many times and you can not go wrong with it as long as you use good quality bread.  This makes the sandwich so versatile! I like to switch out the breads and veggies based on what I have.  Today I used a round Italian Bread fresh from the bakery and left out the yellow squash, but added mushrooms instead.  Also, I prefer goat cheese in place of the feta, but that is my personal preference.  For the mayo mix, I always add a bit of capers and their juice for an extra bit of flavor.  Also, I just roast my veggies in the oven. One of my favorite sandwiches!

This is really good, I think it is the sauce you put on it. I am trying to find healthy food options for my husband and I who eats meat 24/7 tried this and said "it's good." So that is a pretty big compliment!!! I did throw some garlic into the olive oil before brushing the veggies. It is a very versitile recipe!!

Very good. I will probably do a bit less feta next time. Since it is such a strong flavor, it was a bit much for me. Other than that, simply fantastic. Assemble any leftover sandwiches, wrap with foil, and re-grill the next day!

I don't have a grill so I chose to broil as another user suggested. I spread a tablespoon of olive oil across a baking pan and rolled the vegetables around in it prior to broiling. I broiled 3 minutes, rolled them, and broiled another 4 minutes and they were perfect. These were so tasty and so easy to make, I will definitely be serving them again.

Simple and delicious. Used ciabatta bread instead of foccacia. A very easy recipe to customize and make to your liking. I fed it to my veggie wary boyfriend, and now he always requests me to make it!

Possibly one of the only ways to get me to eat and enjoy my veggies! BUT I would definitely recommend substituting either herb-y or plain goat cheese for the feta. The taste is absolutely phenomenal. Don't worry - the goat cheese isn't too strong when matched with the veggies. I also usually add peeled, roasted eggplant as my main vegetable and ditch the onion.

I did'nt grill the veggies but did them in the oven. It was just to dark to see the grill. So I can't imagine how good they would be grilled. I don't think it matters what veggies you use this sandwich is awewsome! I used a garlic/herb foccacia bread. Wow! But make sure you use a good bread it can make or break the whole sandwich.Even my husband who needs meat on his sandwich LOVED these.

This is a fantastic recipe!  It is easy, and it has turned out perfectly each time I have made it.  The sauce is especially tasty.  A nice substitution for the bread is a wrap.  

The first time I tasted this recipe, I couldn't stop saying, "I can't believe I made something this good!"

HOLY COW! THIS IS DELICIOUS! I AM NOT A HUGE VEGGIE PERSON AND THIS WAS SO GOOD AND SO HEALTHY! I WOULD HAVE NEVER THOUGHT OF MAKING SOMETHING LIKE THIS! IN ADDITION TO THE BREAD SUGGESTED, I ALSO USED SANDWHICH ROLLS, WHICH WERE EQUALLY DELICIOUS! THIS WAS A GREAT COMBINATION OF VEGGIES AND THE SPREAD IS MOUTHWATERING TOO! THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECIPE! I WILL FOR SURE BE MAKING THIS AGAIN!

This is to die for!!  I've used this recipe as a springboard for many variations.  I mix roasted garlic with the mayo all the time instead of using fresh.  I also put the veggies (and often leftover chicken) on a pita, fold it over like a quesadilla and grill the pita.  It turns out crispy and yummy!

I omitted the yellow squash (couldn't find any at veggie store) so added more zucchini (can never have too much grilled zucchini).  I also opted against the mayo but will definitely try it at one point.  I crumbled the feta, and toasted the bread ever so slightly...piled on the veggies and I must say, I cannot WAIT till tomorrow lunch hour to eat another one of these!  This is the BEST sandwich I have ever had.  Thank you so much for this Heather!

This was excellent.  I followed the ingredient list exactly. The only change was I cooked on the stove and then broiled.  The veggie combination alone is delicious, but the sauce gives it an unforgettable zing!

Fantastic, Delicious - Amazing, WOW. So good and colorful, nutritious and easy :) My whole family loved these! I added the portabello mushshrooms, too (which I highly recommend), like one of the reviewers suggested. It started pouring rain just as I was heading out to the grill, so I roasted them in the oven on 425 for 10 minutes (maybe 15?) stirring a couple times.  I know they were supposed to be open face sandwiches (I'll try that next time) but instead I used hamburger buns. They were fabulous and we'll definitely do these again. Thanks for posting!

The mayo idea is great! I just popped my veggies in the oven with some olive oil, salt, and pepper. I used portabella mushroom, red pepper, and red onion. After toasting the bread I put it together with feta and mozzarella cheese, topped with arugula. It was AWESOME! Thanks for the great recipe idea!

Oh wow. This is honestly the best sandwich I've ever eaten. The man of the house followed the directions exactly, and after a 10-hour day at work, I came home to the most exquisite sandwich in the world. The aioli is fabulous, totally worth the while, and the veggies are substantial and nothing short of perfect. On one sandwich, he added some grilled jalapenos from my container garden, which were fabulous, but even lacking the spiciness, they were FANTASTIC. Please do yourself a favor and make these sandwiches.

This is the first time I have read so many reviews each a little different from the other, adding each persons favorite touches and they ALL sounded scrumptious.  When I made mine I took a lttle from each and made a dozen sandwiches for a crowd, it's September and I have a garden that is still producing!
My own "addition" was crumbled feta, blue cheese and a sprinkling of grated cheddar. I also used fresh flat bread sliced horizontly.....it was a hit!  Thanks.

This Sandwich was delicious!  The prep time didn't take long, and it was a very tasty fall evening dinner.  Would highly recommend this recipe.  Didn't even notice it was vegetarian.  Lots of flavor.

Truly delicious! I cooked the veggies on a George Foreman grill, adding sliced eggplant and tomatoes, although we thought the tomatoes ruined the taste and texture. I served it on ciabatta bread,  which I grilled for a min after the veggies were cooked. I'll try mushrooms next time.  I made this last week and already have requests to make again! Thank you!

I tried this to see if I could get my kids to eat a vegetarian meal. They were all unsure, but were good sports and they all ended up liking it. I added tomatoes also and loved it. I would have to experiment with different breads though, I wasn't thrilled with the foccacia we used, but the recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was outstanding! I couldn't find focaccia, so used ciabbatta instead. Even my husband (who usually complains when I cook vegetarian meals) said over and over how good these are. Will definitely add this to our regular rotation. We really liked the mayo spread- be generous with it as it adds great flavor. The amount specified in the recipe for 4 pieces of bread was just right so if you want to make more servings definitely make more sauce.

This sandwich was awesome, so tasty! I added grilled baby bella mushrooms to it I grilled the garlic before mincing it and adding it to the dressing. I may try to make this as a roll-up (grilled, too) in a low-carb tortilla next time.

This recipe has so many possibilities. I added sliced meat before sprinkling on the feta cheese and veggies. Don't change the spread because that's the best part. I also topped mine with sage leaves which gave nice flavour complement to the garlic and onion. I didn't have focaccia bread so I used everything bagels. These were a big hit with my family

I made this for dinner last night and it was delicious!! After we were finished eating, my husband, who typically enjoys meat, said we should start cooking more meatless meals! I followed the recipe exactly as it is, and it was perfect. I ate the leftovers for breakfast this morning!

This sandwich was excellent and left me feeling full but not sluggish. After reading some reviews I added portabella mushrooms and added pesto and sundried tomatoes to the mayo mix. Even my meat loving family gobbled these up. Excellent recipe, a must try!!

This sandwich is AWESOME.  Even my meat-loving husband dubbed it delicious.  The only changes I made were to add some fresh lemon basil to the mayo added portobello mushrooms to the veggies and swapped in a Portugese.  I was skeptical of the feta cheese but it was perfect.  Will make again!

The absolute BEST!  This is a great recipe when you just don't know what everyone will eat.  My meat loving husband loves them and even the neighborhood children have seconds! My young adult girls request this meal almost on a monthly basis. Our household rarely eats anything twice but this is one of those we've been making for a couple years now.

The sweetness of the peppers combined with the saltiness of the feta make this an incredible sandwich.  I used chibatta bread instead and grilled it with the aioli side down until crisp.

Awesome recipe. We weren't sure how flavorful these would be but the sauce and feta on the bread made it great! I used cheesy bread of some sort because the store didn't have any focaccia and they still tasted excellent!

Ridiculously good! I marinated the veggies in fresh rosemary, sea salt and olive oil and grilled them on oiled aluminum foil.  Served it on ranch, bacon, onion foccacia bread that I buttered and grilled.  Great grilled meal for a hot summer night.  Thanks for posting!

This has become one of my favorite quick and healthy meals.  I do mine a little different.  I grill up squash, onion and red pepper in a grill pan.  I take a fresh french loaf and half it to make two rolls. I spread the mayo mixture on, layer the veggies and then top with the crumbled feta.  I wrap it up in foil and bake it for 15 min at 350 degrees.  Awesome!!!

Phenominal sandwich!!  I served this on the Easy Focaccia Recipe on allrecipes.com.  I assembled the sandwiches after melting the cheese & then pressed them on the grill with a heavy pan (pan filled with potatoes) for about 1 min each side.  The grill marks were gorgeous.  This is by far the best sandwich I've ever made.

I've never been a big fan of vegetable sandwiches.. but this one hits the spot.  Since I have sensitive teeth, I used grilled whole wheat pita bread instead of focaccia, which I thought was a perfect fit.  I also opted to add sliced mushrooms to the mix.  The sauce was surprisingly simple and delicious.  A couple of personal preferences I included were a tiny bit of balsamic vinegar to give it some zip, and a little bit of fresh rosemary.  Thanks for a veggie sandwich I'll actually enjoy eating!!

These are the most delicious sandwiches! So simple. My favorite sandwich for summer! I generally just saute the veggies and then use my panini maker.

Super yummy, needs plenty of "hearty veggies" though (zucchini, squash, eggplant, etc)...we used mostly peppers and it needed something. Maybe add salami or pastrami or roast beef? Use a good french-type bread (artisian loaf).

This was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except I used french bread (all I had) and roasted the veggies in the oven (instead of grilling)after tossing with a little olive oil. Turned out great!

This sandwich is incredible. I did just a couple things to make it my own. I don't have a grill, so I broiled the veggies. I sprinkled a "no chicken" bouillon cube over the veggies and mixed it around with the olive oil. For the feta, I chose a tomato basil feta. For the focaccia, I chose a tomato focaccia from Albertsons that is wonderful.  I will make this time and time again. My family loved it.

This sandwich was awesome!  I added mushrooms to the mix and instead of using feta, I topped the roasted veggies with a slice of muenster cheese and toasted til melted.  We loved the flavor, but next time will cut back on the garlic cloves.  Just alittle to potent for us.  Thanks for the delish recipe!

Unbelievable!  My husband doesn't like onions or peppers, so I omitted those and put only grilled zucchini and summer squash on his along with thinly sliced fresh mozzarella (didn't have feta).  Served both on sprouted wheat bread (lightly toasted).  Had them two days in a row and would have gone for a third had we been home.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Excellant! Grilled the veggies on foil, used ciabatta bread, marinated in balsamic vinegar and a little brown sugar, about 5 hours or so:Porabella mushrooms, green and red peppers, zucchini, summer squash, red onion, after putting grilled veggies, cheese, spread, on bread, wraped up again in foil, and placed on grill to melt cheese. YUMMMMM!

This recipe is fantastic! Simple, versatile, and satisfying. Stubbornly carnivorous husband said he didn't even miss the meat! I made my own focaccia bread for the sandwiches- the "Focaccia Bread I" recipe from this site worked well- and shaped the loaf a little thicker than the recipe recommended for easy horizontal slicing. We substituted baby portabella mushroom slices for the yellow squash and used a vidalia onion instead of a red onion. The garlic-mayo sauce had enough "kick" on its own and was balanced nicely by the sweet/mellow flavors of the veggies we used.  One thing that made cooking this recipe a lot easier was a grill skillet (looks like a regular skillet with holes... works sort of like a grill basket but sliced veggies won't fall through). Served the dish with baked sweet potato fries tossed with olive oil, garlic, rosemary, and kosher salt, and the combination was to die for! I'm sure we'll make this recipe over and over this summer, with whatever produce happens to be in season and available at our farmers market! Delicious!

This is my first review.  I made this for my son & wife as they are vegetarians..(saved a little for myself to try).  It was outstanding!!!  I used 1 each..zucchini,yellow squash,sweet onion,,red & yellow pepper & tray of steak mushrooms. Put the veggies in 1 gal zip lock bag with olive oil, balsamic vinegar and 1 1/2 tsp season salt. Shook and turned bag a few times while grill heated.  Doubled the lemon mayo but used just 1 tsp crushed fresh garlic...now am thinking 1/2tsp more might be even better and the key is to make ahead.. 4 hrs minimum so flavors can "meld". Grilled vegggies on gas grill using grill wok pan with holes...works slick.  Put on fresh baked ciabata rolls with the lemon mayo and feta..  I am not a vegetarian..but I ate 3 for my supper as it wsas delicious (and the rolls were small..that's my excuse and I am sticking to it.)  Haven't heard from the kids yet..but bet they loved it too!!  Thanks so much for the outstanding recipe!! Will make often!!!

YUMMY!  I was hestitant about making this...boy am I glad I did! I added 1/2 tsp of Oregano & a dash of fresh ground pepper to the spread (which as written is MORE than enough for me and my family-3 people). Added portebella mushrooms, green pepper along w/veggies recipe suggested. Marinated veggies in a balsamic ving. dressing. Sauted them, assembled my sandwich-used feta w/basil & sundried tomatoes. Wrapped it in foil, baked it for 15 mins @350 degrees.  Can't wait to have another one!

WOW. This sandwich was stupendous!  I loved everything about it!  The only things I would do differently would be to use only a little amount of feta if serving this to kids, and next time I think I will try grilling portabella mushrooms with it, I think that would make it a little more meaty since I am not a vegetarian.  Also the recipe says to eat it as an open faced sandwich.  Don't do that. Cut it in half from the side, and then cut it into fourths.  So you will have 4 sandwiches.  Get a little  mayo and feta on each piece, and after all the grilling everyone can add their own veggies.

Wow! The vegetables in this taste amazing. I am going to have to make it weekly. I didn't use squash become I didn't have any and I used gouda as I didn't have feta. I also grilled up a chicken breast for my meat eating fiance.  Love it love it love it!

Thank you for this wonderful recipe. My husband and I loved it.  I didn't have feta cheese, so I used provolone.  It turned out great. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Rather than put the bread on the grill as instructed, I assembled the sandwich and wrapped it in tin foil.  I put the foil-wrapped sandwich on the grill and pressed it down with a brick.  It made the bread crunchier (pannini-style) and held the sandwich together.  Great recipe!

This is delicious. I used both red & green peppers, left out the squash and added mushrooms. 
I cooked on the foreman grill and left out the oil. Grilled veggies are divine and when I brought this for lunch someone asked where I had bought it. A definite must eat all summer long. Now I will have something for all my garden zucchini. The only thing is I might add some mozzarella along with the feta.

AMAZING! My husband was a little skeptical at first- he's a meat and potatoes kind of guy- but he agreed to try it. I added a portabello mushroom sliced, and added some shredded chicken. I also put the veggies in a grill basket to keep them from falling all over the grill. When all was said and done, it was SUPER! I made homemade foccacia bread, and accidentally forgot the sauce when I put the sandwiches together. Even without the sauce, it was soooo yummy. My husband said I have to add it to the regular rotation! THANKS for a great recipe!

Just made this for lunch for my family and they were great! I made a few changes to make it weight watchers friendly. I used Pam for my veggies, used fat free feta cheese and reduced fat mayo. I used whole wheat flax and oat bran pita bread instead. They were so good! I use 1 oz of the feta and 2 tbls of the mayo mixture and unlimited veggies and it was 5 pts per sandwich! I will definitely be making these again :)

The adults in our group rated this 4.7 but the teenagers (who are a little picky) rated it 3.5. This recipe is great as is - no changes needed!  Perfect for a veggie meal. This one was quickly added to my recipe box.

I didn't want to fire up the grill so I broiled the veggies. I added sliced portabella mushrooms for a little bit of a 'meatier' taste. I couldn't find focaccia bread so substituted with ciabatta.

The flavors on this was great! (I added the Balsamic to the Olive Oil)  The veggies were nicely done too. (I broiled mine, as suggested, because of living in Northern Indiana.  I did about 5-6 minutes on each side of the veggies.)  I also made my own bread for it. (Garlic/Rosemary blend.  Very nice added flavor.) It was just a bit hard to eat. But definitely a good sandwich and meal.

This had really nice flavor and the lemon garlic mayo was delish. However, i did not like the focaccia bread with this. It was too heavy for me. I will make this again and maybe put it in a pita pocket instead. It was also really messy to eat on the bread so i'm thinking the pita may hold it all together a little more. Other than that great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This was excellent! I was looking for something meatless for tonight and this is what I happened upon, and am so glad to have found it! Thank you Heather!  My changes: I used generous slices of a hearty whole grain bread; added tomatoes and basil to the veggie mix and marinated in olive oil and balsamic vinegar for about 30 minutes, then baked veggies in a 400 degree oven for about 20 minutes. Assembled sandwiches according to individual veggie preferences, topped with a wee bit more feta and put under the broiler just long enough to melt the cheese. Served with a caesar salad. Delicious! This is about to become a staple in my house!

I DO NOT enjoy vegetables and usually choke them down for nutrition purposes, so when a friend I was visiting told me what she was making for dinner, I cringed.  However...this was the best sandwich I have ever eaten and I am totally converted.  Absolutely delicious.  Not only did I have seconds, but we ate the leftovers the next day for lunch.  My husband enjoyed it as much as I did and this will be a new regular dish in our home.

Delish! Red and green peppers, zucchini, squash and red onions marinated in italian dressing with a spash of balsamic vinegar for a day. I added a portabello mushroom and put in foil pans on the grill. Grilled for 15-20 minutes. Spread the garlic mayo on the focaccia bread before broiling the feta on it. My husband said the flavors were incredible. The veggies would be great even without the sandwich part.

My boyfriend and I started to cut out a lot of red meat and we totally loved this recipe. I only changed it up a little by omitting the squash, had sweet potato mash instead and then I used Ricotta instead of feta and made it on a pannini bun. was truly enjoyable that we made it the next night for dinner to.

I actually used this recipe as a jumping-off point for using garden-fresh green bell peppers.  I used my George Foreman: first grilled the veggies, then assembled the sandwich and "panini'd" it. Didn't have focaccia, but I had Vienna rolls; didn't have feta, used mozz; didn't have yellow squash so I did without. Added deli sliced roast beef.  And I had aioli so I used that instead of the mayo / garlic mixture.  But the idea behind this sandwich inspired me to get creative with what I had in the fridge. Thanks so much!

Love, love, love this recipe! My only changes were to use hoagie rolls and mozzarella cheese, just out of family preference. I also added balsamic vinegar to the veggies. I've made them twice now, and my whole family (including my incredibly picky 10-year old) likes them. The second time, my husband added leftover chicken parm and marinara sauce to his, my older son added chipotle gouda and buffalo chicken strips, and I added a little pesto sauce. We all still used the mayo/garlic/lemon spread on the bread, which is really tasty. It's a very versatile recipe which I plan to make often. Thank you!

This is the best sandwich I think i've ever eaten!  I did make some changes.  I use blue cheese instead of feta.  Instead of zucchini I use fresh sliced mushrooms.  I couldn't find focaccia bread at our local store so I use ciabatta bread instead.  Delicious sandwich!  Even my kids love this recipe!

Made this for my family, and they loved it!!! I did grill the veggies in my Forman grill for a shortcut and they were delicious!  I also replaced the feta for pepper jack and it was yum;) highly recommend it- nice meal for a warm day, or to compliment a soup.

This turned out amazing.  I just had to be really careful when grilling the veggies.  Don't want them too soft!  That crunch makes all the difference.

Freaking delicious, I didn't have a grill available so I had to fry my veggies and broil my bread but it was still very good. I also replaced the feta with mozzarella being my roommate doesn't like feta cheese. I would definitely make this again though. Maybe next time grilled.

Excellent! I've made this twice in one week it was THAT good. The 1st time I made it on the grill;be sure to keep a close eye on the bread or it will burn quickly. The 2nd time I made it on the stove top,and it made a wonderful sandwich.Thanks for a great recipe!

These were great. I too added a teaspoon of vanilla extract, subbed the oil for the butter, and used only a 1/2 cup of sugar.

This recipe is great and allows for so many variations.  Both times I've made it I had different vegetables, but it tasted just find.  Use whatever you have in the fridge.  The must in this recipe is good bread from the bakery! Without the good flavorful bread, the sandwich definitely wouldn't taste as good.

Very good. I think I may try coating the veggies in a little bit of balsalmic next time like another person suggested. My only complaint, which is probably more on how I made the sandwich, is it was messy and hard to eat...veggies sliding everywhere!

I put my own little twist on this recipe since I didn't have all the ingredients that this requires and it ended up being delicious! I didn't use lemon juice in the sauce so I combined some cooked black beans with the mayo and garlic. I also have tried it with regular wheat bread and toasted it was must easier and still tasted good! A few other ingredients that I added were mushrooms, carrots, black olives, and tomatoes (I didn't cook the olives and tomatoes). Still turned out as a great dish! Would recommend to anyone!

Excellent, tasty, easy family favorite. Great for a hot summer evening meal. My kids and husband loved it. I used provolone cheese instead of feta ... just something a bit milder for my kids. I'll try feta next time for the adults.

WoW!  We followed the recipe as written and loved every bite of this fabulous sandwich.  The listed veggies produced 4 open-faced sandwiches (one side of the sliced bread) or 2 2-slice sandwiches.  Thanks so much for this recipe!

AMAZING! I made this exactly as the recipe stated and its perfect, no tweaking/changes needed.  This one is a home run.  (after tasting we decided to add fresh mozzarella and melt it slightly under the broiler - it made the sandwich that much more decadent!)

This rocked my world!  I followed it as written, except I broiled in the oven rather than brave the heat to grill it.  I lined a baking sheet with foil, and broiled the veg for 3 minutes on each side.  I then broiled the bread/sauce/feta open face for 2 minutes.  I'm usually an onion hater, but don't skip them!  They mellow out once cooked and nicely balance the tartness in the sauce.  Served with sweet tea... Delish!

I recently became a vegetarian, trying to transition to veganism... and this sandwich was the best sandwich I've EVER had, meat or not! Even non-veggies will LOVE it!
I added portobello as some others suggested, because I love them and they are "meaty". I also drizzled brown sugar & balsamic vinegar over the red onions while my husband was grilling. We did not have focaccia on hand or at the store, so we got hoagies, and I made a rosemary-thyme-basil-and-olive-oil mix and brushed it onto them, then popped them in the oven at 250° for 12-13 mins. I also used Nasoya "mayo" because I try to limit my egg and dairy intake as much as possible. I wrapped the assembled sandwiches in foil as another suggested and put them in also, at 300° for 6-7 mins. It was enough for 4 sandwiches.
They were SO AWESOME, if and when I go vegan, I will have to find some kind of feta approximation! WOW!!!

This was good but could be great with some adjustments.  We added tapenade on top of the mayo, grilled mushrooms and asparagus. Also added some balsamic to the veggies before grilling,  A bit difficult to eat because the ingredients are stacked so high, but worth it.  Made it with whole foods asiago cheese bread.

This was AWESOME!!  I cut up onions, zucc/squash, red pepper and shitake mushrooms and threw them in a grill basket with some olive oil, salt and pepper.  Our local grocery store was out of foccacia so I just got a good bakery roll...and I swapped out the feta for some goat cheese - just based on personal preference...this was AWESOME.  Way better than I expected...I'll make this again in a heart beat!!  Thank you for the awesome recipe!

We have been making this sandwich so many times since we found the recipe 4 years ago on Allrecipe.com.  One time, we couldn't find focaccia bread in our local supermarket and tried it with ciabatta bread.  Since then, we always use ciabatta bread because the texture is so much better than focaccia bread.  It's crunchier and chewy and perfect match with soft sweet roasted vegetable.   We tried with Italian bread, French Baguette, sour dough bread, etc.  But we like the ciabatta bread the most.

I'm not big into zucchini or squash but made this since my husband is a vegetarian and thought I'd try something new.  This was amazing.  I love this and will be making it many more times.  My husband thought it was excellent too.   I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  All I can say is try it...you will like it.

Absolutely delicious! A great recipe! I don't have a grill, so sauteed my veggies and put the bread under the broiler after spreading mayo and feta to toast the bread and melt the cheese. 

I will try to broil my veggies next time too...as some have done! 

With other sanwiche recipes like this, I have sauteed carrots and mushrooms and think they'd also make excellent additions or variations for this recipe.

I loved the lemon-garlic spread and would like to try it on other sandwiches. We did serve ours open face too with a few optional herbs like chili pepper flakes, dill or a veggie friendly mix of herbs by a certain Mrs. D! I sprinkled mine with dill, but would like to try adding it to the mayo mix next time. 

I bet these would be out of this world if actually cooked over a grill! I'll be sharing this recipe and make it again and again!

AWESOME! I made this recipe for the first time a week ago and I crave it constantly.  I added pepper jack cheese for a little bit of spice.  I also mixed some dry herbs and kosher salt in the olive oil before spreading it over the veggies.  I even made a version with grilled chicken breast seasoned with parsley, thyme, garlic powder salt and peppper... that was wonderful as well.  My kids love it and they are very picky eaters.

DELICIOUS! Did not use a grill. Wrapped sandwich in foil and put in oven on 400  for about 10 minutes. Used portabello mushroom, bell pepper, onion and fontina cheese.

Had this a few days ago and I can't stop thinking about it.  It was served open face, veggies were marinated in a balsamic dressing and pesto was added to the mayo spread.  Can't wait to have it again!!

This is my absolute favorite recipe from this whole website! I'm not a vegetarian, and I like my meat, but this sandwich is so filling and satisfying, you don't even notice that it's missing. I serve it open-face on ciabatta bread and it's phenomenal. YUM!

Delicious! This four-star recipe becomes a five-star recipe if you add portabella mushrooms! I'd personally recommend making a double recipe of the mayo sauce, as well.

I tried this and I was unsure how much I'd like it, but it was fantastic.  I made a couple changes, just small.  I wanted to add a little more protein and nutritional value than mayonnaise, so instead of making the lemon garlic mayonnaise I used a white bean hummus.  Very easy to make, very yummy.  I also used mozzarella instead of feta just because it was what I had on  hand.  I thought it was great, and my husband loved it too!

Delicious! I used pre-sliced focaccia bread that was on sale, and made narrow hot open face sandwich things. My boyfriend, an ardent meat eater, said they were decent, which, translating from male, means excellent. I broiled instead of baked. I attempted to keep the veggies all nicely lined up on a tin-foiled pan, but ended up mixing it all together. Turned out fine. I usually despise red bell pepper, but it was great in this. As someone else mentioned, the bread makes this sandwich, so choose wisely.

Mmmm So delicious. Definitely better with some portabell mushroom slices. It adds that "meatiness" to it. I usually grill up whatever I have of the following list - zucchini, summer squash, mushrooms, red (or green or yellow or orange) bell peppers, eggplant, onion, beefsteak tomato. I toast the bread on the grill and melt the cheese on it before layering on the veggies and the sauce. So satisfying.

Wow was this good! I grilled the veggies on my forman grill, and threw a portabella on there, and caramelized the onions. I used a ciabatta roll and smooshed it pannini style on the forman grill and it was just to die for!

I loved this recipe. I only had peppers, onions and zucchini but it tasted sooo good. I reheated this at work and my co-workers came looking to see what smelled so good! I loved the mayo mixture and will now be putting this on all my sandwiches. Try this you'll love it!

Very good, attractive sandwich. I've made this several times, grilled the vegetables on a countertop contact grill. It's delicious as written with the feta cheese, also good substituting sharp cheddar. My favorite is cream cheese sprinkled with just a little cayenne (takes the place of the mayo dressing and the feta cheese).

This recipe was fantastic!!  I loved the spread  made  of mayo, garlic, and  lemon juice. It really made the sandwich. I've actually used this as an accompanyment for other dishes, including grilled halibut Instead of the foccacia bread I used flat bread rolls, which worked great. I will definately make this again!

I recently became a vegetarian and have been unable to eat the dishes I prepare for my family. Today I ran across this recipe and decided to make it regardless of others' tastes. My husband and I loved it!!!! (Didn't bother making any for kids.)The only thing I changed was instead of mayo on the bread I used olive oil. Since my last recipe was a failure, I am very happy to have a new (vegetarian) favorite!

This really makes a great sandwich.  We tossed the veggies in a little balsamic vinaigrette before grilling them, and they turned out perfectly.  Will definitely make again.

This was delicious and super easy.  Added the portabellos but didn't change anything else.  Thanks for a great alternative to grilled meat.

Great sandwich recipe - I used spreadable garlic and basil goat cheese (Chavrie) instead of the mayo & feta, which I thought was both redundant and potentially crumby.     No focaccia either - sourdough was a great substitute.

Summer is here...and you NEED to make these sandwiches!!! Fantastic taste, easy to make & everyone loved them! For taste I made the dressing early in the day to blend the flavors & added a few shakes of dried basil. Added sliced Portabella mushrooms with veggies and threw them all in a ziplock with the olive oil salt & pepper to taste. Used Ciabatta rolls (4-5" square ones from deli section...firm outside soft inside). I will make once a week all summer!!!

Yum Yum Yum!!!  When I told my husband we were having veggie sandwiches on some fancy bread he totally turned up his nose at me.    That was not going to satisfy my Extra Meat guy.... after lunch he layed claim to the leftovers to take to work the next day!  He really loved it.  We all did.  I made them exactly to the recipe and they came out great!

I have actually had this recipe printed from this site and pasted in my "tried and true" book for a couple of years now...thanks for a winner, Heather!  The only changes that I might make on occasion is the foccacia (onion or 3 cheese?) or I might change the veggies some to suit whatever I have on hand.  The sandwiches are always delicious!  I think the key is the aioli and the feta (I use quite a bit of garlic in my aioli).  Wonderful!

When my husband picked this recipe for dinner, I read it and thought, 'It sounds ok, but not that exciting.'  I read the reviews with a bit of skepticism, thinking, 'How can a grilled veggie sandwich be THAT good?'

But it was!  The combination of the lemon mayo, the warmed feta, the foccacia...this sandwich was fabulous!  I can't rave enough about it! 

We did marinate our veggies in a rosemary garlic marinade first, but that was the only change we made.

If you can find foccacia, it is worth it.  

Thanks for a great recipe!

My daughter & I decided to try this today by using the marinade for Yummy Honey Chicken Kabobs for the veggies. Added basil to the mayonnaise and used slices of sourdough rosemary. The feta provided just the right amount of saltiness for the grilled sweetness of the veggies. Absolutely yummy!

Made this sandwich for a July 4 picnic and it was great. I added portabello mushrooms, grilled for the same time as the zucchini. Also, I used Italian dressing as a brushed-on marinade instead of the olive oil.

Since the yellow squash at my grocery store was questionable, I substituted portabello slices.  I decided to cook my veggies all together in my grill pan indoors, and it came out great!

This is the best sandwich EVER!!!!!  I love it!  The only things that I did was swap the bread for a whole wheat bread (budget constraints) and I think that it allows the vegetables to stand on their own.  Instead of grilling the veggies, I layed them on a small roasting pan (single layer), sprayed them with Pam and sprinkled freshed rosemary on them.  I roasted the veggies (turning once) until they were tender.  After trying this recipe, we ate it 3 more times within 3 weeks.  I just cannot get enough of it!

Loved, Loved, Loved! Our whole family gobbled this up, thanks for the recipe! We added chicken breasts, cut  in half to compliment our sandwhiches. Easy and tasty--I crave this at least once a week!

I loved this sandwich.  I didn't use the garlic mayo though since I made it the day before and found it to be too garlicky when I went to use it, so I used champagne dressing instead.  Wonderful!

The mayo mix was too much for us.  The choice of vegetables is good, though.  Definitely needs more "meat."  Adding a portobello would make it much better.

WOW! Awesome recipe!  Don't leave the aioli out, it really makes the sandwich!  I also cooked my squash in the oven for a little bit, and it cooked as fast as my other veggies when I threw them on the BBQ.

Absolutely delishus!  I used my Rachel Ray grill pan (as I don't have a real grill) and the veggies came out tasty; I bought focaccia bread from Panera's, cut into 1/4s, and each in 1/2. I used Italian seasoning in the mayo dressing as I was out of garlic cloves and yellow squash. I added green and yellow thinly sliced peppers and minced mozzarella instead of feta. WOW! I recommend this filling dish even for a light dinner.

Phenomenal sandwich!  I added a portabello mushroom and used asiago cheese instead of feta.  Also used a garlic rosemary loaf of bread.  Can add balsamic vinegar as well, was good with and without.

AMAZING!!!   Wondered if would like it without meat (we had bacon on standby) but definitely didn't need it.   I marinated the veggies in Italian dressing and skipped the oil which added some deliciousness.   Also used sliced provolone since I didn't have enough feta cheese.

SO AMAZING!  I used whatever I had left in my fridge: eggplant, yellow pepper, mushrooms, yellow & green zucchini and it turned out amazing. If you're not a huge garlic lover I would only use one clove.

Here are my tips: Slice the Foccacia in two, split it so as to make an actual sandwich. Not open faced as the recipe calls for. Feta is nice but it wont melt. I marinated sliced goat cheese in a seasoned oil mixture for several hours. Basically, put herbs in some olive oil and place the cheese in. The cheese will take on more flavour. Then use this flavourful oil to brush your veg on the grill. Dont marinate the vegetables like some have suggested. In vinegar? Why would you do that to a vegetable! :-)Keep their own lovely flavour please. The raw garlic could be very strong indeed. I suggest roasting the garlic or using powder / dry garlic flakes. I suggest serving with toasted walnuts for crunch and peppery rocket/arugula/rucola leaves for a zip of flavour. Using a portobello mushroom is a great idea but it makes this a veggie burger type recipe and moves it away from its fresh veggie recipe. Eggplant/aubergine I suggest slicing and grilling as this compliments very well.Also, so that it all comes together I suggest wrapping in aluminium/tin foil for a minute or two on the grill. That way everything is hot, the cheese has a chance to melt and your bread wont blacken.

Oh My!  It was better than I imagined.  Added balsamic vinegar to the basting oil.  Used a vidalia onion and cholmondleys bread from Graeter's because that is what we had.  Grilled on the panini press.  Served as a closed sandwich.  Can't wait to have it again.

We don't have a grill, so I roasted my veggies on a cookie sheet with some olive oil and salt and pepper.  I also made mine a wrap instead of a sandwich and it turned out beautifully!  I added some shredded basil to mine and it really amped up the flavor.  Great recipe to use up summer veggies!

The family loved this & we did not miss the meat. We grilled our veggies on an electric grill & added a couple of drops of liquid smoke to the olive oil to give it that grilled-outside flavor.  Our only suggestion was next time we will not serve it open-faced, just to make it easier to eat without utensils.

My brother and I are both teens, we made this together one day for lunch for us and our parents. It took us about 35 minutes start to finish and it was DELISH! we made some changes, like shallots instead of onion (which makes it so sweet and so good!), and asparagus instead of squash (grilled asparagus is to DIE for). Really, you can do any good 4-5 vegetable combo with this sandwich and it will still melt in your mouth and warm your belly. We also used ciabatta bread instead of the focaccia but any good italian bread grilled up with that yummy mayo-oil-lemon glaze and melted feta will be so great. Such a crowd-pleaser good for any summer occasion! MUST TRY!

Delicious sandwich! Super filling, my husband and I didn't miss the meat at all. Since I am not a fan of squash, I used egg plant instead, added sliced portobello mushrooms and marinated artichoke hearts. Marinated the veggies in balsamic vinaigrette dressing over night as suggested by other reviews, and replaced the feta with provolone (my husband isn't a fan of feta). It was one of the best sandwiches we have had and will be a regular on our menu from now on.

Had my nefew and his girlfriend over for dinner and she is a vegetarian so I did the vegetables and I also marinated some chicken breast for the meatlovers.  I didn't have any feta cheese so I substituted brie cheese and everyone loved it.  I will definitely do it again.  Would give it 10 stars.  I would also like to try it using the feta cheese.

This DELICIOUS!! Next time I will cut back a bit on the garlic since the cloves I used were pretty big.  I couldn't find yellow squash so I bought some big white mushrooms (thinking portabello would have been better).  Also, I have to buy a veggie grilling basket - I lost half my veggies in the fire lol!  I used rosmeary foccacia bread too and I can't wait to eat this again!  Thanks for the recipe :)

I liked this sandwich. Thank you for sharing. My husband, on the other hand, did not like the sandwich - he loved the veges, but he felt the spread was too garlicky and wasn't a fan of the feta. Changes I made: I did not grill the veges. I roasted them in the oven. I cut up all the veges and put them on a foil lined baking sheet. I salted and peppered them and tossed them in 2 tablespoons of olive oil with a pinch of sugar.  I roasted them in a 450 degree oven for about 25 mins.  I used a Tuscan Garlic loaf I purchased from the bakery at my local grocery store. Otherwise I made it as stated and kept it as an open face sandwich.

Best sandwich ever!!! Such a simple recipe but packed with flavor. I was out of gas for the grill so I broiled the veggies and I made homemade Focaccia Bread (recipe found here). The combination of veggies, feta (awesome choice), special mayo and 'still warm from the oven' fresh bread was amazing!! A recipe I will make again and again. Thank you so much for sharing Heather!

This was such a good dish. I slightly altered it for a few reasons. We added chicken breast marinaded in olive oil, minced garlic, minced onions and a tiny splash of cooking sherry. The only problem I had with it was the sauce. When I tasted it, it was like EXTREME horseradish, which my family is not a fan of. So we dropped it and went with a spread made of crushed red peppers, sour cream, cream cheese and a few other ingredients. Worked out great.

I used my electric grill for this and it came out WONDERFULLY. The feta didn't melt too much, but it was just fine once I slapped the veggies on the roll. We did not serve them open-faced (bread was thin enough) and I added mushrooms to the mix-- kinda surprised they weren't a part of it!

This was an awesome recipe! My only negative thing to say is that it was very messy, at least for me and my family. Maybe instead of open faced, I would try some kind of roll where the veggies will have at least one side that they wont fall out of!

This is soooooo delicious. Made it as written except added only 1 clove of garlic to 1/4 cup mayo. I also used french bread, split horizontally, some homemade wheat bread, and an extra three yellow squash (I had a bunch). My husband, who doesn't like squash or zucchini, was very skeptical. I put the sandwiches together and then left the room. He decided to take a bite and I heard him exclaim "This is amazing!"

WOW!!  What a Sandwich!  I doubled the Mayo mixture.  Since it was raining today, I broiled the veggies.  It took a lot longer using the broiler, but well worth it.  This is definitely going to be enjoyed in my house on a regular basis from now on.

My family loved these.  Quick and easy to make.  The only thing we added was some grilled asparagus that we had in the fridge.  For the family members that wanted to add some kick we put a little Sirachi sauce in with the mayo.

Added mushrooms and green peppers. Started on the Forman grill but it was easier to saute everything together. Ate it on sliced rosemary and olive oil bread. Loved it!

Eggs (in mayo) and cheese are not vegan so practically the sandwich is not vegan either. Casein(animal protein) gives you lots of health issues, including higher risk of getting heart diseases and cancers, so please try to avoid using dairy products and eggs if you want your vegan diet to work.

This recipe is absolutely delicious and filling! We had company over (one of the two was a vegetarian)-they both raved over the sandwiches and wanted the recipe! I wouldn't change a thing about it and will definitely be having it again soon!

I made this last night.  My husband and I loved it.  I followed some reviewers suggestions and cooked the veggies and chicken in broth.  I also added powdered Rosemary to the mayo spread.  I marinated the veg in balsamic dressing and Mural of Flavor (Penzeys awesome salt free spice)! I used lots of different types of veggies and cooked them  in the broiler.  This is a KEEPER.

This was great! I ddn't miss the meat at all. Try adding sweet potatoes, it was good. I think you could have fun being creative with just about any vegetable. The feta cheese and Focaccia bread add nice flavor.   I will make this again.

We loved this recipe! Although we are not vegetarians, we do get sick of the combo of meat, potatoes, and veggie. This was a gourmet alternative that was absolutely delicious. I grilled the veggies on the Foreman grill and then grilled the whole sandwich like a panini. Perfection!

Delicious. My husband & I LOVED them & we're typically meat-eaters. We added grilled tomatoes & put a little cayenne in the olive oil to brush on the veggies, which added a nice little kick. This will definitely be on our frequently cooked list. Yum.

Great sandwich! I did add homemade coleslaw and alfalfa sprouts which made it amazing! I also roasted the garlic for the mayo spread and added pimentos. The best sandwich I've ever had!

This was a delicious sandwich.  We were too lazy to fire up the grill, so we just sauteed the veggies in olive oil until tender. We heated up ciabatta rolls in the oven with the mayo and feta.  It was great!

Made this memorial weekend while hosting the entire family - I served 8 adults and 3 teens. Doubled it and used oatnut bread and whole grain bread instead of focaccia. Mixed in a bit of garlic, sea salt and pepper with the grilled veggies. Made two sauces - one with mayo and one with horseradish instead of mayo. Cooked veggies til tender. Placed bread with spread on griddle, heaped on the veggies and a second slice of bread and lightly grilled sandwiches, no oil. Got rave reviews, even the teens ate it. Didn't make enough though - had to split the last sandwich with hubby! Family called for recipe afterwards.

Definitely 5 Stars!  I am a celiac and am also dairy intolerant and I made this on gluten free Udi's bread with spectrum canola mayo (sans feta) and even then it was positively fabulous!!!

WOW!! This was AMAZING!! My husband completely laughed in my face when i told him I was going to make this for dinner and was planning a backup meal! He was blown away...he said it is the best sandwich he's ever had. You can really use any veggies you prefer (I would never omit the zucchini/squash though), the sauce really makes this sandwich in my opinion! We did not have focaccia (sp?) and made it with a pumpernickel loaf instead (personal taste, we both like that bread)...next time I'm going to try to make a bread machine focaccia recipe off this site for this exact purpose. LOVED it!

This was really good! I am really not a huge vegetable fan, but I loved this! It was raining so I made it in the broiler, but it came out great. By the way, focaccia is REALLY easy to make, so if you can't find any at the store just make it!

FANTASTIC!  I used no fat mayo but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.  I broiled the veggies as I don't currently have a BBQ and they turned out great!  This will certainly be a regular for our family.  I look forward to trying out different veggies for variety.  Thanks for posting!

Yum! I followed the recipe for the most part but added a little lemon zest to the mayo & garlic mixture, used sourdough bread and smoked mozzarella instead of feta. My husband was grumbling when he saw it but loved it after the first bite!

This sandwich is wonderful! It's true, you will not miss the meat. I used rosemary and garlic french bread instead of focaccia the first time and it was perfect. I used focaccia the second time I made it and didn't like how it fell apart. So from now on I'll use french bread. Mmmmm. Just thinking about it is making my mouth water.

When I  told the hubs we were having grilled veggie sandwiches for dinner tonight he was extremely skeptical.  I made two changes.  First off, there wasn't a loaf of focaccia bread to be found in the entire area so we used rolls.  Secondly, neither of us like feta cheese so we used crumbled extra sharp cheddar cheese.  Everything else remained the same.  After his second sandwich, I was informed he would eat this meal anytime.   Everything complemented each other. YUM!!!!

LOVED THESE!  We felt like we were eating at Panera Bread but sitting at our own kitchen table!  I couldn't find Focaccia bread in the grocery store, so I bought an italian loaf and just sliced it into sandwich size to grill.  I also topped the veggies with southwest seasoning and put them in foil so they didn't fall through the grill.  Either way, this will definitely be a regular in our house now!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

there were so many 5 star ratings out there, that another review seemed superfluous- but it should be noted that in addition to being absoutley delicious, it was very easy. Prep time was closer to ten minutes. Loved it!

10 thumbs up!  This sandwich is so unbelievably good.  My husband said it was the best he has ever had.  We added grilled chicken to it but ONLY because we had some leftovers - incredibly good with or without the chicken.  Thank you for sharing this as it is now a favourite in our househould.

This is awesome.  Even my boyfriend who believes that all dinners should contain meat raved about this.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added a little Old Bay seasoning to the veggies before grilling.  I made extra so today I can have the leftovers in a wrap for lunch.  YUM!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was SO good! I am planning to make again soon. I also wrapped my veggies in foil and then put them on the grill like some of the other reviewers and they turned out great!

Everyone raved over this. Pretty garlicky even with less garlic than called for.  Maybe next time I will make the spread earlier and let it sit longer to mellow in the fridge.  Very yummy as is, though!

I am a meat eater through and through.  This is absolutely amazing and delicious!  I have made this with a grilled portebella mushroom and without.  Yummy both ways.  I used pepper jack cheese, which for me, just made the sandwich!

Excellent sandwich! It is imperative that you do not over cook your veggies and that you use a quality bread with a decent crust. I used veggies I had on hand, zucchini, tomato and mushroom and finished it with some fresh cracked pepper...YUMMY!

10+ ..... I loved this sandwhich! I used Ciatbotta bread instead of the Foccocia....I also used light mayo.....the combo of the lemon/garlic mayo with the feta was delicious. I thought that this by far was the best sandwich I have ever made at home. Love it! It was perfect! Thanks!

Tasty! I'm not a big meat eater and my husband doesn't care either way. As long as he gets a meal! I made these one night and he loved them. I roasted all my vegies in the oven. Used zucchini, red onions, orange/yellow peppers and made my own focaccia bread. Sometimes I add portabello mushrooms or chicken. Sprinkle garlic salt on the bread before I toast. Then I assemble them, add the cheese and use my panini press. YUM

Being a semi-vegetarian I had to try this...I love dishes that pull meat lovers over to the dark side, and this is definitely one of those recipes!  The mayo was amazing, and no one missed the meat!  My only stray from the recipe was broiling instead of grilling because, um, it's February aka freezing here in nyc ;)  Thanks for a great recipe Heather!

Oh.My.WORD!! This was simply amazing! I didn't "change" the basic format of the recipe as in the blend of flavours, but I did convert it to vegan. It was out of this world! Using only vegan friendly substitutes I had the best meal I've had all week! THANK you!

Simply delicious! The only change I made was to add mushrooms, because I can't get enough of them, and I used french bread instead of the flat bread as it was what I had on hand. Everyone loved it and there wasn;t even a scrap of leftovers to be seen, all of it was happily gobbled up. I loved this so much I drove over to my parents house the next night and made this same dinner for them since I knew they would love it too, and they did! A total keeper, I will be making this over and over again, thank you!!!

OMG!  We are total meat eaters around here, and I thought that I would have some resistance from the hubby.  Boy, was I wrong!  There were no leftovers.  So yummy!  We cooked the veggies in foil over the grill - for simplicity and clean up.  I will be making this again and again.  Who knew veggies could be so good?!?!

I added some chives to the feta mix, and skipped the squash but I couldn't get over how incredible this sandwich was.  I made a bunch for several days worth of box-lunches and it just got better each day that passed.  Next time I'm going to halve the garlic for the sake of co-workers!

These were great and will make again!  Used roasted red pepper from jar which had a nice pickled flavor, yellow squash, zucchini, candy onion, and sweet frying pepper all garden fresh, made dressing as directed with Hellmens.  Found focaccia bread rolls at Wal Mart.  Grilled the veggies separate to soften then added the veggies, dressing, and feta on the bread and grilled again til toasty.  Thanks for sharing!  The dressing is yummy and I was skeptical due to not eating mayo.

My husband seemed disappointed when I told him we were having grilled veggie sandwiches for dinner, but when he tasted this, he was totally delighted! Now I make them fairly regularly, with a couple of modifications: I add fresh basil to the mayo.  I also use ciabatta (sp?) bread and make paninnis using my Pampered Chef grill pan and paninni press.  Takes like a restaurant-quality sandwich!!

This is a great recipe, and very flexible. I've made it exactly as written, and with various substitutions (different types of bread, different veggies - carrots, mushrooms, peppers etc.) and it always tastes delicious! I also love the fact that it's so quick to make.

This is really fantastic!  I didn't follow it exact...(I used whatever was growing in the garden), and it turned out great!  My favorite thing about it is the dressing.  That is going to be a ritual sandwich spread for me from now on!

The poor-man's aioli really makes this sandwich.  Use a spicy garlic if you can. This is one of the best meals from allrecipes I've had in a long time.

Tried this tonight on my meat eater hubby and it was a big hit.  I couldn't have been more surprised or pleased.  This is a very flavorful and satisfying sandwich.  I used ciabatta rolls and another reviewer's suggestion.  I grilled the vegees, then assembled the sandwiches and wrapped each one individually in foil.  Baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.  Oh my goodness!!These are fantastic!  I even used grapeseed mayonnaise and they were outstanding.  Thank you Heather, for sharing this great recipe.

I have made this sandwich for 3 different dinner parties and everyone always loves them and wants the recipe. You can't beat the sauce with the grilled veggies! Outstanding! I don't change a thing except trying different bread each time.

This recipe was really good but I experienced two issues in its preparation.  First, no one in my family likes mayo so I had to come up with a replacement.  I used a mixture of cream cheese and lowfat plain yogurt.  Very good!  Second, enough veggies to make these sandwiches takes up a LOT of space on your grill resulting in difficulty turning all of them.  If you don't have a veggie griller basket, I recommend heeding others' advice and broiling your veggies in your oven.  Overall, the recipe was delicious and my family is still talking about it!  Enjoy!

These sandwiches are awesome.  I made a few changes because I don't have a grill.  I firstly i burshed the veggies with crushed garlic and olive oil and roasted the veggies in the oven at 400 for about 20-25 minutes.  I then used my George Foreman Grill to make it like a panini.  It was to die for.  I forgot the mayo but it was fine without it.

This was quite good.   
I have used eggplant, onions, bell peppers, zucchini, and squash in this sandwich before.  I'm not so sure about the spread but everybody else seemed to love it! 
Without a doubt, I will make this one again.

Too bad I can only give 5 stars.  These recipe is deserving of so many more.  These are the BEST!  Who knew eating veggies could taste so good.  So much flavor with minimal effort.  My husband is a meat lover and he does not miss the meat at all in this sandwich.  We make these at least once a week during the summer.  We have tried many different combinations of veggies.  I would suggest buying a pan that you can use on the grill.

I'm not vegetarian and neither is anyone in my family, but this was a huge hit. The mayo spread and feta seem to be the key. I made it twice - the first time I used dill rye bread (toasted first then broiled with the cheese etc) and topped it with broiled veggies (zucchini, red onion, and green peppers). The second time I used regular whole wheat bread (prepared the same) topped with sauteed zucchini and yellow onions. The first time was definitely better (the red onions add a lot!) but both were delicious, quick and easy, and guilt-free!

I thought this sandwich was delicious! I don't have a grill, so I took the suggestion of sauteeing the veggies then putting the sandwich in the oven. My husband said it was the best sandwich he's ever had! I used Italian 5-grain baked bread (the closest I could find at the bakery).

I held off on making this recipe for a long time because I feared the results wouldn't be worth the effort.  I was so wrong.  This is totally delicious, even with low-fat feta.  (Although the homemade focaccia bread may have had something to do with it!)

This was unbelievable!  I used an extra zuchinni and pita bread instead of foccasia (yum!) which made it easier for the kids to eat.  Rather than brushing with oil I put the sliced veggies in a bowl, drizzled it with the oil, put a lid on and shook it up.  Much faster!  I also found that I lost a lot of the veggies through the grate of the BBQ so next time I may just roast the veggies in the oven.

The flavors in this are amazing.  Hard to believe it's only lemon juice and garlic in mayonaise.  Amazingly delicious.  I will make again and again, especially over the summer with some chilled wine on the patio.  My 37 year old red-meat lover son gobbled them up and raved about them!  Yum Yum.

Wow, this was better than I could have imagined! I omitted the lemon juice from the mayo mix, and added some basil pesto instead. The idea of squash in a sandwich kinda turned me off, so I replaced it with a portobello mushroom. I didn't melt the cheese on top, just grilled the focaccia, slathered on the mayo, piled on the grilled veggies, and topped with cheese. The BEST sandwich ever!

So easy and quick and pleases everyone I've served it to!  I've served this twice now and we absolutely love it.  I have a stovetop grill pan that will make those gorgeous grill marks on the veggies, so I've made the sandwich on both an outside grill and inside as well ... this sandwich turned out just fine either way.

This last time I made some minor adjustments for personal tastes, but if you follow this recipe to the letter you won't be disappointed.  I chopped up some fresh flatleaf parsley to go into the mayo mix and used a bit more garlic.  We love feta cheese so I didn't bother measuring, just crumbled it on top of the bread.  I didn't have a red onion this last time and used a sweet one ... perfection!  This sandwich is VERY forgiving to a few changes.  I also slipped a few fresh tomato slices into the finished product just before serving - the last time I just sliced them up and served them on the side.  

This recipe won't disappoint, give it a shot!

This was a pretty good recipe. I love sandwiches. I couldn't find the charcoal for my charcoal grill, so I just baked the vegetables in the oven. I should have put the harder vegetables in first. It was kind of messy to eat b/c the vegetables kept falling off. I will be making this recipe again.

Very good! The bread tends to slip and slide around due to the mayo and cheese, so I used a toothpick to hold it together. Great weeknight sandwich or lunch at the lake...

Very good. Added mushrooms the second time, worked well either way...
Also just sauted the veggies and that worked well as well. Mine didnt look as neat as the photo, but they were good.
Oh also didnt have any garlic so no garlic in mine

This is a great sandwich. I haven't changed anything about it and wanted to make it more often, but slicing all those vegetables for a family of 5 was taxing. Once a bought a slicer, this recipe was a breeze. Excellent recipe and a family favorite.

Personally squash was out of season. If it is out and you want to make this,  try eggplant! I did and it came out fantastic.

Very flavorful. For sauce, used half the lemon juice, and it was still very tart. Just did grilled red pepper and red onions, as well as grilled chicken. Used store-bough bread and it was great. Didn't use zucchini and it still tasted great, although zucchini would probably be delicious too.

this is fabulous! I used roasted red peppers in place of red pepper strips. I also added fontina cheese in place of the feta. You can mix this up so many ways.

Absolutely delicious! Have made this 3 times now and my wife and I both love it. Used ciabatta instead of focaccia - brushed with olive oil and then toasted on the grill. This one has made it into our rotation.

We love this recipe. It's one of our favorite things to eat. I don't use much oil when I cook if I can get away with it.. I just cook mine in a deep frying pan. I spray lightly with olive oil and add some balsamic vinegar. I also add a tiny bit of water to keep it from burning and to help steam it, then cover pan.  We love it best with jalapeno cheese bread.

My favorite recipe ever! My boyfriend and I make these at least 2x a month. We get the mini ciabatta rolls from BJs and cut them in half to make 8 open faced sandwiches. I usually eat 2 and he eats 4 and then I have 2 leftover for lunch the next day. They are even amazing to eat cold the next day! My sister tried them and said it was the best thing she has ever eaten. And she used to think she should be a food critic so that is quite the compliment! Thank you Heather for this delicious recipe! If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would! ?

We loved it! I marinate the veggies in balsamic vinegar for several hours, including portabello mushrooms. We also added thin slices of provolone and melted them as well. Delicious! And it was even better the next day when I reheated the leftovers for lunch.

I couldn't find focaccia bread so I used an Italian loaf and I used Monterey jack cheese because I don't like feta, otherwise made as written and we loved it! served with salmon patties because we are not vegans just trying to eat more healthy...

I've been trying to find new ways to incorporate more veggies in the meals I cook and was pretty excited to find this recipe. I had to change a few things as I forgot to get zucchini from the store, so I used portabello mushrooms instead, and couldn't for the life of me figure out where to find focaccia bread, so I used Italian bread instead. My fiance and I really liked this recipe and will definitely make it again! :)

Yum! Have made this a part of our regular menu. We just heat all the veggies with olive oil in a pan and toast feta on ciabatta bread in oven on broil then add veggies and ENJOY! Thanks for sharing.

I've made this recipe five or six times in the last few months, and I have to tell you.  It's AMAZING.  It is a favorite for both me and my husband, and I always think about it all day when I know it's what we're making for dinner that night!!!

For my meat eating husband, we add grilled sliced chicken.

If we for some reason can't grill, I will broil the vegetables in the oven on a regular pan.  Totally delicious either way.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G - I grilled my veggies under the broiler which was quick and easy.  I also omitted the feta and opted for no cheese.  It was perfect.  My husband and I both were in love with the "sauce" and will use it for other options.  Super easy recipe and very yummy.  I felt like we were eating at a restaurant.  I used a low calorie/low carb tortilla rather than bread.

Just made this tonight, and LOVED it! My husband saw it and said, "Just vegetables?!" but after one bite he said "Wow, this is SO good!" (and that is saying a lot). The only thing I would have changed is adding less garlic to the sauce. It was a little too garlicky for me.

This recipe was great. I couldn't find regular focaccia bread, so I got herb & cheese focaccia and it worked quite well. I also didn't have a grill so I put the basted veggies in a glass Pyrex dish and broiled them under high heat, tossing them around every few minutes until they were cooked. I toasted the focaccia using the same method. Everything turned out great, this is an awesome recipe.

Boyfriend liked it, he ate the whole thing. He even said it sounded gross before he tried it. lol!! I cooked the veggies on my griddle and baked the bread in the oven on 350 until the cheese melted a bit. About 3 minutes. I also added salt and pepper to taste.

Very nice sandwich. I did add some balsamic vinegar to the veggies otherwise I think it would have been a bit bland. The only other thing I would change would be the cheese. I think mozzarella would go better than feta.

Fantastic! Really simple to make while also tasting quite delicious. I didn't have lemon juice on me, but had some tangerines so I squeezed those in. Tasted great!

Delicious recipe! I made the following modifications: used Dave's Killer whole grain bread, broiled the vegetables, and added fresh thyme to the dressing since I had some on hand. Very flexible recipe that can be adjusted to suit different tastes.

These were really delicious. My kids did not like them but my hubby and I really did. I followed the advice of other reviewers and marinated veggies in balsamic vin, EVOO and S&P for 15 minutes before roasting in 450 degree oven for 25 minutes.

Oh my gosh!  So good!  Cooked the veggies on the weber grill, and it was smokey and delicious.  Not sure why this very simple recipe is so good, but it is so very good!  New to vegetarian and this was the bomb!  I added mushrooms, and ran out of feta so added a little pepper jack in addition to the small amount of feta I had.  Not sure if you could screw this recipe up to tell you the truth.

Awesome sandwich!! I served on Foccacia bread that had garlic and added mushrooms to that sandwich instead of red onion.  Also, I took other reviewers advice and marinated veggies beforehand in Newman's light balsamic vinaigrette...so tasty!

Incredible! I never thought my meat-eating husband would request a vegetarian sandwich over and over again, but this one has been in our meal rotation for a while now. Love it! Depending on the size of the focaccia you find you might want to cut the bread into 6 pieces (cut into 3 sections and then split those with a horizontal cut).

This really is quite good. I used 2 small garlic cloves instead of 3, since we are not garlic people, and it was still quite garlicky for us. My 2 year old ate them up!

Yum! This was delicious and we all loved it! My kids were a little worried about all the veggies but when they took a bite and tasted the garlicky spread on the focaccia bread, they were sold. Thank you for a delicious recipe!

Delicious!  I did add grilled chicken breast seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic...obviously not vegetarian , lol.  I also added fresh basil leaves and some grilled tomato.  It was a whopper of a sammie, but a great all-in-one summer supper.  Thanks!

Fabulous meal! We did add in mushrooms. A must. 
The grilled mushrooms and onions were the hit of the meal. Cheesy foccasia bread and some sweet potato steak fries and fruit on the side made this a great tasting, filling veggie meal! Enjoy!

Wow, great sandwich.  Followed exactly, except I only had hoagie rolls.  Also had a portabello mushroom, so sliced that up and added it.  One of the best sandwiches I've had, ever (meat or no!).

This recipe is delicious. I don't have a grill so I didn't BBQ it but I did saute it until it darkened and half way through cooking the peppers, I added the squah, zucchini and onions. I also added salt and pepper. I didn't have focaccia bread but I have these sourdough slider type rolls...it was sooo good. And the mayo spread...delish. I want to make this again tomorrow.

Wow,  there is a reason this recipe is so highly reviewed! I've made this twice now... the first time I followed the recipe exactly, and it was delicious. The second time I added a few mushrooms I had leftover, and used a 35 cal/tbs. vegan mayo instead of regular. I could not tell the difference, and it was once again fantastic! I will be making this often.

Wow - this was delicious!! I didn't have the yellow squash, so I skipped that, and I used roasted red peppers instead of fresh.  I had parmesan focaccia, which made this sandwich even better.

Did under the broiler because I didn't have a grill, and added in some chicken fried in cajun; turned out absolutely wonderful.

Wow!  I wasn't sure if they could live up to the hype, but they did.  I used really good crusty rolls instead of focaccia and I did them in the broiler instead of on the grill.  We also just tossed the veggies in the veggie grill basket instead of cooking them like it says flat on the gril..

My husband gives this a 3 1/2 stars, I give it a 4.  Everything tastes better off the grill!   We used green peppers instead of red.  (Though I prefer red, we just had green on hand).

My husband LOVES this recipe. I followed it pretty closely except that I toasted the bread inside in our toaster oven before spreading the mayo mixture on it, and I grilled the onion slices inside in an iron skillet while hubby did the rest on the gas grill. Onions tend to fall apart when you grill them, so I just figured it would be easier for me to do them. These are very yummy - serve with lots of napkins!

This is a great fresh-tasting sandwich.  I've made the recipe twice, both times using ciabatta rather than facaccia.  The second time I sprinkled the veggies very lightly with Italian seasoning.  I found that it works well to pour the olive oil into a plastic bag and tumble the vegetables in it for even coating.  Next time, I'll add portobello mushrooms also.  Thanks, Heather, for a great sandwich recipe.

I made this for dinner yesterday. My husband made a face when I told him we were having vegetable sandwiches, but once he tasted them he said he didn't even miss the meat. They turned out fantastic! The dressing mixture and the feta cheese really brought out the best of this sandwich. I made the focaccia bread myself (also from this site) and the taste was good, but the texture wasn't so great. Next time I will buy the bread. FIVE stars, definitely.

Delicious way to use up an over abundance of garden veggies. I used Italian focaccia bread and added garlic salt and Italian dressing to the mayo. I marinated the sliced veggies in Italian dressing before grilling. I will add grilled chicken next time so the family will eat it.

My husband - who answered this recipe by saying "Where's the meat? Can you add tuna?" - actually claimed it was "Not bad." This is a miracle.  By the way, tuna apparently works with it, if you have a desperate carnivore in your home as well. He also recommends grilled chicken.

My husband and I tried this sandwich tonight and we both agree it's one of the best we've ever had.  I used ciabatta bread and made a traditional sandwich instead of an open faced one.  I also used viadella onion instead of red onion for some added sweetness.  We grilled the bread, made the sandwiches and wrapped them in aluminum foil; then we put them back on the grill to melt the feta a little bit.  Both of us agree that the mayo makes this sandwich something special.  The sandwich is so good we're adding it to our usual round of meals.

YUM!  My boyfriend loved it, too, and he usually avoids vegetables like this.  I added portabella mushrooms and marinated the bell pepper, zuchinni, squash, and mushroom in balsamic vinegar and a lil' brown sugar all day.  It was perfect.

these are fabulous! I also add portabello mushrooms and use whole wheat flatbread instead of the focaccia.

This was delicious and very quick to make. I sauteed the veggies in seasoned oil. You can even do that ahead of time and assemble, heat & eat later. Also, I used round pita type breads (their thinner & come already sliced). You can use a panini press, or I used my Foreman grill to heat it.

This was awesome! and it really is all about the bread you use regular sandwich bread just doesn't cut it.  also when i was grilling the veggies i used a little Italian salad dressing which added a nice flavor.

This is only the second time I felt something was so delicious and versatile that I wanted to comment.  Simply adjust veggies to suit your own taste.  Roasted in oven due to weather for outdoor grilling.  Mayo with garlic is wonderful complement as well.  Will try to add chicken to same marinade for my protein chewing friends.  Thank you

All I can say is, "AMAZING". The spread and grilled veggies are a great combination. Add a bit of chicken and you have a wonderful meal for the non-vegetarian at the table!

This was a great sandwich! I made my own focaccia bread and also added sprouts to the sandwich. I left out the feta because we didn't have any. The lemon garlic mayo definitely made this sandwich! Thanks so much, and I have a good amount left over to eat for lunch the rest of the this week!

This was awesome!!! I was scared at first of the mayonnaise sauce, but it was really good. I used regular bread because I didn't have any other kind. Toasting it on the grill made tough enough to hold all the veggies and I had no problem with it falling apart. I think next time I'm going to add tomatoes. I am going to make this all summer long- my new favorite sandwich!!

This sandwich equals perfection, I wouldn't change a thing! Would LOVE to find more vegetarian meals this delicious!! Thanks SO Much for the recipe! :)

I couldn't find yellow squash, so I subsituted with eggplant. Used portabello mushrooms for my husbands. First time I made this, I packaged the veggies in foil and grilled outdoors. This took too long. The next time I made it, I threw all the veggies together on the George Forman and -voila!- done to perfection within 10 minutes.   As other reviewers said, you need a top notch bread for this. I used Rosemary foccaccia bread, and the end result was fantastic.  The garlic mayo mixture was perfect combined with the feta. I assembled the sandwich, then grilled for less than five minutes. Will definitely make again!

This was pretty good. I didn't like the mayo that  they wanted you to make on it. I didn't think it was very fitting on it. I would use a different sauce next time.

This was very tasty, however I felt it was a lot of work for a vegetable sandwich :) I don't think the mayo/lemon mixture was needed. There was enough flavor going on with all the veggies. It was 21 degrees outside and I was NOT grilling out there, so I used my George Foreman grill...I don't recommend doing it that way, because it was not big enough to accomodate all the veggies I had cut up and it took forever to cook them. I should have roasted them in the oven... This was a change of pace from what I usually cook for dinner so I am glad I tried it. Thanks for posting.

Good one.  This was easy to make.  I also added mushrooms.  Next time I will use a different bread.  The focaccia is too much bread.

I've never made anything like this before at home so I wasn't sure it would turn out as good as a restaurant veggie sandwich but it was!! So easy too! Its too cold to cook on the grill this time of year so I grilled my veggies on the George Foreman. I used a whole wheat mini sub bread also b/c i couldn't find Focaccia bread.

This is a really good recipe, but I think the mayo is what makes it great! I had some portabella mushrooms on hand, so I soaked those in a little soy sauce and water for a few minutes before throwing them on the grill. They were a great addition. Don't leave out the red onion either, it's great on this sandwich!

This is such a great recipe! I did not have access to a grill so I roasted the vegetables instead. I added a couple of portobello mushrooms to the mix as well. I served to meal for myself & my sister (we are both vegetarians) and two friends that are both meat-eaters. Everybody LOVED it! No leftovers :)

Not that this recipe needs another positive review, but I must say it is FANTASTIC exactly as written. I made it a second and third time and would emphasize one thing: don't skimp on the lemon! It wouldn't be the same without. I tossed the veggies in olive oil and lemon juice in a plastic bag, then grilled them on my panini press. Then grilled the whole sandwich in the press. Delicious results with minimal mess.

When I was putting this together I was thinking,"There's no way all those reviewers were right. How could all these vegetables possibly rate five stars?" I mean, desserts are worth five stars, but vegetables? Well, I was wrong and the other reviewers were right. This was SO GOOD! It made vegetables worth eating.

WOW! I can't believe how much we enjoyed this. I'm vegetarian but my fiance is not, and we both just absolutely loved this. He only sort of jokingly asked to have this as his birthday dinner! I used an indoor grill and gosh, doesn't everything look tastier when grilled? Used rosemary bread and marinated the zukes and squash in Italian dressing but otherwise followed the recipe. We ended up eating five open-faced sandwiches between the two of us, and used one red pepper, one yellow squash, and one zucchini total (all gone!). The garlic mayo is to die for. Everything about this sandwich was lovely. We ate with knife and fork and will certainly eat this again very soon. This may be one of the yummiest things I've found on this site!!

This is a delicious recipe!  I was too lazy to start up the grill when I made this recipe, so I broiled my veggies in foil tents instead.  I added some liquid smoke, and they turned out great!  I noticed some confusion in the other comments about the focaccia bread.  This is a very thin type of bread, and when used for sandwiches it is cut horizontally to make two even thinner slices of bread.  Also, this recipe calls for "open face" sandwiches, meaning there is not a slice of bread on top.  That is how 4 servings can be made out of 2 pieces of bread, which are each cut in half.

This is fantastic, because there are so many varieties.  I grilled zuccini, yellow squash, red and yellow pepper directly on the grill and sliced some onion and mushrooms that I grilled in tin foil.  I used goat cheese (becuase I can't have dairy) and dijon mustard on the focaccia bread which I made from the recipe "Focaccia Bread" :) from this site.  DE-licious!

Absolutely amazing!  I made these as a light dinner, but they were actually quite filling and incredibly delicious.  My husband does not consider a meal a meal unless it has meat, but he loved these.  In fact, we only had enough veggies left over for one of us to eat a sandwich the next night, and we were fighting over who got it!

My husband was literally pouting as I made these sandwiches. (He would eat meat for every meal) He ate two entire sandwiches!  That speaks volumes.  I used a very large head of garlic, so the cloves were extra large as well-and it was a little too much garlic.  So beware of that, other than that, Yum.

OMG! This sandwich is soooo great ! My family loved it, my daughter even said it is now her favorite. I did put a little balsamic vinegar in with the olive oil and a teaspoon of basil. I mixed that really well and poured it over my sliced vegies. I let sit in the refridge. for a bit along with the mayonnaise dressing. My family all eat meat accept me, so I made some grilled chicken strips to go on theirs.   I put the vegetables in a grilling basket. The focaccia bread on a tray with the dressing and a bit of Mozzarella (I'm not crazy about feta)  We will be having this again and again.

I absolutely love these sandwiches for lunch! I usually add a slice of cheese on top simply to hold the vegi's together. The feta cheese really adds to the flavor and therefore cannot be left out.

Wow, these are insanely delicious!  My fiancé’s first words were "wow, this is great. Mmm, tastes like it's from a restaurant"... I added fresh chopped basil to the mayo, skipped the lemon and used Trader Joe's garlic mustard aioli to spread on one side of the bread.  Also used TJ's Mediterranean feta.  We ate them as regular sandwiches, not open faced as the recipe says.  Lastly, once assembled, I wrapped them in foil and threw them back on the grill for a few minutes so the cheese would melt.

This is one of my favorite quick meals to make now that I'm watching my weight. I use my George Foreman grill when I don't really want to set up the grill and now that I've made my own ranch dip, I'll use that instead of plain mayo. This is also good with any variety of Alpine Lace cheese. You can use low-carb bread or wrap the grilled veggies in lettuce or cabbage, too.

Truly top notch. Simple to cook/prepare, creates a dynamite restaurant style lunch. Only change was a substitution of eggplant for yellow squash. Highly recommended.

Turned out great!   I added portobello mushrooms to list and grilled everything with a little olive oil, salt, pepper and lemon.   I skipped the mayo, but did put the veggies on fresh foccacia. Very delicious.

These sandwiches came out quite well. Was quick and easy. I didn't find them awesome (may be I got my hopes too high after reading all reviews!). But given the ease of making and no special ingredients required, I think these were worth the (very little) effort. Will make again.  Thanks a lot for sharing!

Great sandwich! I split whole wheat sandwich rolls & used the George Foreman grill. To melt the cheese onto the rolls, I used the microwave. It probably wasn't as good as if I'd grilled over coals, but still a winner.

Wonderful! I added a little salt to the garlic mayo, and let it sit for a few hours in the fridge before making the sandwich. I followed other reviewers advice and tossed the veggies with some balsamic vinegar (along with olive oil). I then baked the veggies in the oven at 400 for 20 minutes. My oven is a little strong, so more time might work for others. I assembled the 2 sandwiches (2 pieces of bread each), wrapped them in foil and put them in the oven for 15 minutes at 350. So good! I will definitely make these again.

I can't believe I had saved this recipe several months ago and never made it. This sandwich is amazing! I didn't change anything on the recipe. All the flavors blend so well together, so if you are planning on making this recipe, make sure you have all the ingredients.  I didn't find focaccia bread in the store today, so I used a french baguete. Thank you Heather, I will definitely make this again!

The only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because I was missing some of the ingredients due to location.  I also was not able to grill the veggies so I just sauteed them, but it turned out wonderful!  It is definitely a keeper!

Excellent recipe!

It was freezing cold when I made this, so I broiled the veggies in the oven instead of grilling outside.

I also used fresh mozz cheese instead of feta since I had that on hand.

Instead of the garlic mayo, I used a balsamic dressing on the veggies.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!! This is a 5 star sandwich! I am not a fan of roasted or grilled red pepper because they have a tendency to over-power so I cut that out. I used eggplant, summer squash, asparagus, & portobella. I substituted feta for provolone, then I used fresh alfalfa sprouts. So yummy! Can't wait to make it again!

I'm typing this review after eating even LEFTOVERS that deserve 5 stars.  Amazing.  I followed all the directions except added olive oil to the mayonnaise mixture only because my loaf of bread was so large and I thought there wouldn't be enough.

It did take me quite a bit longer than 3 minutes on each side to grill the veggies.  And it also was a shame that some of the veggies fell between the grills.  Maybe next time I'll use medium sized summer squash and zucchini.  

The feta makes it so good.  It might be good with grilled mushrooms, too.

Fantastic recipes.  Thanks for sharing.

Oh my gosh!!!!!  That truly was one of the most wonderful grilled sandwiches I have ever made! I just used a bunch of different veggies and added portobella mushrooms and it was perfect!  I too, was worried about the mayo but could not believe how wonderful it tasted.  I will make this again and again!

Loved this sandwich! Grilling the veggies imparts a delicious flavor that goes perfectly with the mayo and feta. Served this for a light dinner and four out of my five children ate this with no complaints, my baby (age 6) wasn't so cooperative but I still consider this one a winner!

I love this recipe!  I made it exactly as written, and wouldn't change a thing.  The combination of grilled vegetables and the foccacia was awesome - This is one of my new favorite recipes.

This was really good. I didn't have feta, bread or the squash.  I used a laughing cow baybel cheese, a pita pocket and mushrooms.  Would make this again

Ten stars is more deserving!!!  Don't be fooled by the simple recipe.  The flavor combination is absolutely delicious!!!  My husband, who is anti-vegetable, has not stopped raving about this sandwich.  He has eaten this everyday for 3 days now!! I grilled the veggies in a cast-iron grill pan on the stove, and broiled the bread with the cheese on top for a couple minutes.  I bought a round loaf of Foccacia Bread at the store and cut in in half and then in quarters.  So I got 4 sandwiches out of this.  The best sandwich ever!!

Very yummy.  I made mine on a George Forman Grill and it came out great.  I also added mushrooms.  Even my meat-loving husband liked this.

I have been making these for few years now, I make them on the George Forman. I grill the peppers and onions, then the zuccini and squash. Put the mayo mix and feta on the bread, then the veggies, i put alittle olive oil on the top and bottem of bread and put it in the george forman till the feta is melted and has a toasted top. VERY VERY GOOD!

This is a really refreshing meal. The only thing is that the lemon juice and mayo mix tasted a little weird to us. But, we'll put something else on it next time. A great idea.

Thanks for the recipe.  The special mayonaise and feta give a great flavor to the vegetables.  The sandwich was definitely more than the sum of its parts!

This was amazing! Only thing I did different was splash the veggies with balsamic vinegarette. We put them in foil and steamed them on my griddle.

We really liked this! It was very easy to make and tasted like something you'd get at a restaurant. I used a large focaccia loaf I found at the grocery store. It was great!  I will definitely make this again.

I'm on a low cholesterol diet right now, so this was a good choice for my dinner tonight.  My wife and I loved it so much, she's asked me to make this on a regular basis whether we're on a diet or not!  Simple, simple, simple and SO GOOD!  I skipped the red onion because I forgot in my haste to put dinner on the table, but I don't think I missed it.

This was exactly what we needed for a hot summer evening! We used whole wheat pitas for the bread and it worked just great. There wasn't nearly enough of the mayo mix, though.

OMG i love this recipe! Am student and need something quick and easy. 
I used wholemeal bread and added some potato breaded chicken breast in the sandwich, just needed the protein. I didn't have squash, so i used mushroom instead. Whatever it is, it was quick, easy and tasty and i am definitely stuffed right now * rubs tummy* THANKS for a great recipe!

Excellent vegetarian dish!  The feta cheese with the garlic mayo went fantastically with the vegetables.  One note: Next time, I'll turn the grill down to medium before putting the foccocia on, since the bottoms started burning within a few minutes.

This recipe was delicious! I completely cheated and didn't follow the recipe to a T. My version used a very nice slightly crusty bread, cheddar cheese, green, yellow and red peppers, zucchini and red onion. For the mayo I didn't have time to chop real garlic so I just used garlic powder. Also I put all the ingredients on the sandwich, open face, then I grilled them in my toaster oven. So I cheated but the results were absolutely delicious!

This was so yummy!!!  I cooked in my oven, as others did and used sour dough bread, which I though was a good choice.  I also used herbed goat cheese and was happy that I did that.  I used eggplant, zucchni, red pepper, onion and asparagus.  As roasted veggies go, it didn't look so pretty but I will definitely make again and add whatever is in season.

These were fantastic. I added some Zesty Italian dressing to the olive oil and I tossed it all together with the veggies in a container with lid (instead of brushing them). I also broiled the veggies in the oven, and grilled the bread in the oven as well. I didn't have feta on hand, so i used shredded mozzerella and shredded old white cheddar. DELICIOUS!

Incredibly good!  I added 1 eggplant and 1 zucchini when grilling for a little more variety.  Be careful with the bread because I took my eyes off of it for one second and they burned.  Regardless, the were so good and everyone loved them.

Fantastic recipe.  I substituted Halloumi for the feta which worked great.  Just throw the Halloumi on for about 30 sec to one minute depending on how thick you slice it.  Adds a nice texture.

Pretty good.  Would probably be good with turkey or chicken also.  Next time I would use a softer bread and not serve open faced.

Delicious!  We used ciabatta instead of focaccia, and the sandwiches were incredible.  The aioli really does make it, though I cut back on the garlic a bit so it wasn't too overpowering.  Thanks!

I made a lot of changes to this to accomodate stuff I had on hand, but I've tried to grill veggie sandwiches before and they never turned out this good!  I used provolone instead of feta, bakery hot dog buns instead of focaccia, and wasabi GourMayo as a time saver (and to use it up since I don't think it's very good on much else).  It must be brushing the veggies with oil, and grilling the bread, but these taste like something you'd order at a restaurant!  Even the meat & potatoes hubby loved them!  Thank you for sharing!  I'm finally a vegetarian grill master!

Very good.  I used different type of bread which I will not next time because it was so hard to try to eat the sandwich without everything falling out.  Keeper for me. Thanks.

I roasted the veggies in the oven under the broiler, and used tandoori naan instead of focaccia since the store didn’t have any. I assembled the sandwiches and toasted them in a skillet with a little bit of non-stick spray. Yummy!

This is unbelievably delicious. Even my meat-loving husband raves about this dish to other people. He says he never would've thought he'd love a veggie sandwich, but he loves this one. I made it exactly as the recipe said, except I broiled my veggies in the oven rather than using a grill.

This recipe never disappoints. I have never reviewed a recipe before and this one deserves every star! I have never used the focaccia bread but instead use Naan, so it’s always open-faces. Highly recommend making this!!

This was SO GOOD! The melty feta mixed in with the aioli spread and made a creamy layer on top of the grilled bread. I salted and peppered the veggies and brushed them with a little bit of balsamic vinegar as another reviewer suggested. The veggies shrink up when cooked which I didn’t think about. I’ll make more veggies next time. I LOVED THIS meal!

Really great sandwich.  My boyfriend will always prefer meat in his meals so we added slices of grilled chicken breast to the sandwich and we both loved it. The grilled vegetables paired perfectly with the grilled chicken, garlic aioli sauce and feta.

This was REALLY delicious!  As others suggested, I marinated the veggies beforehand and I think that turned out to be a smart move.  I bought 1 zucchini, 1 yellow squash, about half of a sweet red pepper and about 8 stalks of asparagus.  I tossed them with 3 tbsp oil, 1 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper.  I marinated them in the fridge for about 45 minutes, stirring them occasionally.  Because it's a bit cold here today, I roasted the vegetables instead of grilling them: about 20 minutes at 450deg (stirring halfway).  I then put the sauce on the rolls, then some shredded mozzarella and shredded parmesan, and put them under the broiler for a minute or two.  The sauce with the marinade was really quite delicious.  I will cut back on the oil next time because 3 tbsp was a bit too much for that amount of vegetables.  I can't wait to try this again!

I absolutely loved this recipe! Made just a few adjustments.. I  substituted the feta cheese for shredded smoked Gouda (mind blowing) I also grilled my veggies for 8 minutes on both sides and added a pinch of salt and black pepper before putting it in the oven. Best of the best!!!!!

This may be the best sandwich I have ever eaten! Even meat-eaters will have to admit it is first rate. I made the recipe exactly as written on focaccia bread using the recipe from this site which is also top notch. If you want to impress your guests with a trendy casual meal this will do nicely, but be prepared to work.  The vegetables took up my entire grill pan which is rather large and it took about twice as long as the recommended time after cutting to the thickness  shown in the video, but it was worth the wait.

This recipe is delicious! I used a vegetable grill pan to grill the veggies- added  grape tomatoes and 8 oz. sliced portabella mushrooms to the mixture, and added a few splashes of balsamic vinegar to the olive oil, salt, pepper and basil, and marinated the veggies while the coals were heating up. I used a loaf of French bread. I also used Monterey Jack and sharp cheddar cheese in place of feta. I used garlic powder because I was lazy and didn't feel like peeling and chopping garlic cloves- I added maybe between 1/2 tsp- 1 tsp. garlic powder to the mayonnaise and lemon juice. I will make this again. Made 4 very large open face sandwiches. I wrapped the 2 remaining sandwiches in foil and plan on reheating in the oven at 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes later this week. update: the plan to eat these later this week- lasted all of 3 hours after dinner. I preheated the oven to 425 and heated the foil wrapped sandwich for 20 minutes. Crispy, hot and delicious! Several days later- still crispy, hot and delicious after being wrapped in foil and refrigerated for 3 days, then baked as above. The vegetables are a little softer than the original just grilled sandwich, but still delicious!

Dang! These sandwiches are the bomb! We couldn't stop eating them! I used the everything loaf from Walmart and then made them into open face sandwiches. After I grilled the veggies, put the sandwiches together, sprinkled the feta cheese and then placed them under the broiler. Instant favorite! These are amazing!

Delicious.  Served it as an open face sandwich and made tons of onions that I sautéed on a piece of foil on the grill.  Red peppers definitely took longer to cook than squash and zucchini.  I threw the sliced vegetables in a gallon size ziplock bag.  Seasoned the olive oil with some ranch seasoning and poured it into the ziplock bag to mush around to coat all of the vegetables.

This was far better than I anticipated.   I had made veggie sandwiches before but nothing compared to this!  I did add Avocado to it at the end and couldn't find the right bread, so bought some onion/poppy seed buns, and WOW...just delicious!  Not a huge eater, but could have had two sandwiches!!  Excellent recipe.

I made this on an indoor grill.  I used sliced whole wheat bread, and no red peppers so I used chopped green peppers.  Even with these changes, it still turned out wonderful.  Looking forward to trying it again, but with all of the correct ingredients next time!

I made this using the focaccia bread recipe on this web site. I rolled the focaccia bread thin so I didn't need to horizontally slice the bread in half. I doubled the ingredients for this recipe. Also, I didn't have an outside grill so I baked the vegetables at 450 F and turned the temperature up to 500 F for the last 5 minutes.  I cut the focaccia bread into slices and then flipped the cheese side of the bread over, placed the mayo mixture, feta cheese and vegetables on the slices and baked it at 450 for about 5 minutes. This came out great and I will definitely make it again.

What a great sandwich! I used a garlic Asiago Italian bread, added more garlic, and loaded it up with all if the veggies in my drawer. Had to do mine in the broiler, which took longer (had to work in batches) but was still yummy. I'll make these again for sure!

Followed recipe except used different bread.  Next time will use ciabatta.  This was an excellent sandwich for when my vegetarian son came for dinner with us.

Trying to bring down my meat intake so I decided to make this and I was not disappointed. Honestly I didn't know a vegetarian sandwich could taste this good! I seasoned my veggies with a bit of paprika and just a hint of cayenne pepper before grilling them and to give it a little tangy flavor I topped it with a couple of banana pepper slices. All in all excellent recipe!

I love this dish. It's the spread and the cheese that really help get the veggie taste out and delicious flavor in. I used bolillo (Mexican French bread) and queso fresco( Mexican whole milk cheese) instead of what the recipe calls for. Overall this is an awesome dish to take fora healthy lunch. Also feel free to slap on the spread on the bread it is so good!

OK, this recipe is fantastic! I changed just a few things. I added white mushrooms and omitted the squash. I also halved the garlic after reading the reviews, which I recommend. I used onion rolls instead of focaccia because that's what I had on hand. I also squeezed some lemon juice on the veggies prior to grilling. My 8 year old doesn't like the veggies, so I also grilled up some pork chops to put on his sandwich. His had the sauce, zucchini, feta and the pork chops, which he loved. Will make again, thanks for the recipe!

Such a simple and delicious sandwich to make! Even my carnivorous husband loved this veggie sandwich! The mayo mixture really adds a lovely flavor. There is a strong flavor of garlic, but if you love garlic like we do, it will be fine. You can easily reduce the amount of garlic to 1.5-2 cloves so that it's not overpowering for you. Since we don't care for feta cheese, I used provolone. I've made this twice since the weekend and added sauteed portobello mushroom slices (sauteed in evoo, salt/pepper, and a little balsamic vinegar). This recipe is very versatile in that you could probably add other grilled or roasted veggies. Overall, there is no need to adjust the measurements to the recipe. It's perfect as written!

As a meatatarian I have made this recipe a number of times and loved it. I did a little variation using some garlic powder, seasoned salt and oregano on the vegetables and topped the sandwich off with a drizzle flavoured balsamic vinegar.

Couldn't girl the veggies at my place so I fried them. I used a premade garlic sauce that has the same texture as mayonnaise but I don't know the English name. I also put raw cherry tomatoes in and some mozerella because, why not? Over all it was very yummy.

I added a lot of fresh basil leaves and some vegan pepper jack cheese. Really enjoyed it that way. May try a layer of spicy guacamole instead of the mayo/garlic next time. Store was out of focaccia so used ciabatta instead.

I didn`t change a thing but I did cook my vegetables on the stove and then just popped the sandwich in the toaster oven to broil.  I am sure it would taste better on the barbeque.   Great recipe

We've made this about six times and simply love it.  The only thing we change is we double the aoili and we sub ciabatta for the focaccia.   Just a personal preference--  sometimes we add portobello mushrooms.

A go-to summertime favorite for my husband and I! We LOVE it on toasted ciabatta bread too. I've also experimented with taking all the sandwich toppings and using them in a quinoa salad with fresh basil and a balsamic vinagrette and toasted pine nuts. Ridiculously delish. But you cannot go wrong with this sandwich!!

This was fantastic.  My kids loved it.  You can modify with different veggies such as mushrooms and tomatoes to mix it up. I broiled my veggies in the oven instead of grilling them since I was in a hurry and it worked out fine.   Will definitely be making this again.

I'm amazed it tasted so good. The reviews were right I didn't miss the meat at all. I saved the feta for another meal but used provolone slices. Any melty white cheese adds flavor. Also added baked/breaded eggplant wheat belly style using ground flax instead of breadcrumbs. Oh and focaccia was pricey so I went for this soft onion hamburger bun which I toasted. Recipe is still good as is but  tailoring it to personal tastes is okay folks.

This recipe was so good. I didn't have the fresh garlic since I forgot it at the store but this was great anyways. My husband and son enjoyed it. We hope not to mess up and burn the bread on the grill next time but even with that it was amazing. Thanks for the great recipe.

Used ciabatta bread since the grocery store didn't have ciabatta. Great recipe. I put the peppers and onions on girl for a little first and then added the squash and zuchinni. Will make this again!!

This was amazing, I made this for myself and my non veggie loving husband.  He was plesantly surprised and ate the whole thing.  That in itself is amazing for someone who doesn't care for veggies.  I loved it,I'll make it again for lunch.  Can't wait....

I thought it was ok, but not thrilled with it. It may have been the spread or feta cheese, cause I ate my extra veggies with no problem. I may try again in the future.

This is a simple, flavorful sandwich.   A bit messy to eat, but worth it.  I used ciabatta bread, and ended up having to broil the bread/cheese thanks to a thunderstorm.  Even my carnivore husband loved.

This was fantastic - a twist on a sandwich I already like to do.  The focaccia bread really made a difference in the overall flavor, and I added some Portabello to the mix in order to make it a little more hearty.  The mayo mix was also tangy enough to make the combination of flavors that much more interesting.  I will grill my bread a little bit longer next time, although it was crispy (my feta hadn't started melting after the 3 minutes, but I was cooking over a medium heat).  I can tell this will be a regular summer recipe!

Delicious vegetarian sandwich that meat lovers will also enjoy! I know because I made this for my meat loving husband and he asked for seconds. For even more richness and flavor I carmelized the red onion with butter and brown sugar. I also used eggplant in place of the squash out of my own personal preference and a jar of roasted red peppers for convenience. So good and you can't mess it up.

SO DELICIOUS! Made this for dinner last night and I am making it again tonight. As someone who is actively seeking health-conscious vegetarian options, I really gravitated toward this recipe. Glad I did! Only changes I made: I used Olive Oil/Balsamic Vinaigrette on the veggies, I used a nice piece of italian bread toasted in the oven, I omitted the cheese (IT DOES NOT NEED IT!) AND I added Roasted Jalapeno peppers (diced and seeded) in to the Aioli recipe. I could eat this every day. I was satisfied and yet, I felt good afterward.

WOW!  I see why this has 5 stars!  Amazing! This will be made many times around here!  Actually... I'm going to make it again TOMORROW!  :-)

I used my cast iron instead of grilling it, other than that I made it just like it says here.

This recipe was amazing! I cooked the veggies on my foreman grill and as a previous poster suggested, baked prepared sandwiches in the oven. It was so easy! This is a definite make again!!
My husband loved it and said it tasted like something you would eat at a restaurant and pay $20 for!!

FANTASTIC SANDWICH.  You will wonder why you ever eat meat!  :-)  Only other comment is that this recipe works GREAT under the broiler.

Absolutely delicious! Although I have a few minor suggestions. I'd keep a few pepperonis handy if you have a picky eater. My husband was a happy camper after he added some. I love the sauce so I doubled the portion on it and was thrilled with the taste.

This is by absolute favorite dinner to have in the summer when the veggies are readily available. It's garlicky and feta-y and delicious. Every flavor compliments the others and you don't miss the meat.

Absolutely fantastic recipe! This sandwich is full of flavor and texture when done correctly. It has become a personal favorite, mainly due to the complementing flavors of the feta and mixed veggies.

Mouth-watering, scrumptious! I made it stove top and it was just as good. I also added fresh basil, tomatoes, and avocados. Such a good and easy recipe.

this recipe was amazing! I left out the squash because I didn't have any on hand and it was fine. I also added some thinly sliced grilled chicken for my boyfriend because he isn't one to appreciate vegetarian options haha it was delicious made both ways, will be making this again soon.

Yummm! These were some tasty sandwiches!  Of course I had to change a few things like 1 less garlic clove in the mayo, added some grilled eggplant & instead of the feta I used fresh mozzarella, it was fantastic!

Mmmm....from a meat lover, this sandwich is incredibly tasty!  The simple sauce and feta cheese really compliment any vegetable you want to add...and I thought carmelizing the onions added great flavor.  I will definitely add this to my recipe book!

Made this last night, it was AMAZING! I soaked half of the veggies in white balsamic to give some extra flavor but not overpower. Also used fresh mozzarella. Will become a summer staple for us!

WOW!!  What a great sandwich!  2000 stars!!  My husband made this for me and my boys and everyone was awed by the great taste.   We used sliced grape tomatoes from our garden instead of the red pepper and took the recommendation of another reviewer and used whole grain English Muffins instead of the recommended bread.  Best meal I've had in a long time!  Thank you so much!

Oh my goodness... this is SOO good.  The only thing I did different was use a tomato basil feta cheese and just regular wheat buns (They were out of focaccia at the store).  LOVED it!  This will certainly become a summer favorite!

Absolutely Amazing!!! We are meat lovers and were somewhat skeptical of what we were going to get and were more than pleasantly surprised.  Even the kids loved it!!!  SOOOO much flavor!  This will be on our Meatless Monday rotation from now on!  Only thing we changed was using an herbed hoagie under the broiler rather than the foccocia toasted.

So good my 3 year old even liked it (besides the spicy onions, but that's typical).  My husband kept saying, it's too good to be good for us.  Fun, fast, and easy to change up with different veggies!  (Though I can say for sure my mom would not be so impressed, with her love for an old fashioned meat and potatoes diet.)

Delicious! This is my go-to recipe when entertaining my veggie and non-veggie friends alike! I often broil the veggies, and it's still just as good. Last time, I added grilled eggplant. YUM. My favorite delivery system for this is day-old Jimmy John's bread. Only $.50 per loaf!

My husband cannot eat a meal without meat. He just won't. I made these using my George Foreman grill. Talk about awesome! He ate them with the promise that if he didn't love them i would make some chicken to go with it. He said " its so good it doesn't need meat!"(says the carnivore he he) The mayo really made this. I only had limes so i used them and doubled the amount and used garlic powder for consistency. He wants this mayo on everything now! Also the Feta was spot on! great dish! wish i could give it 10 stars.

Ok, so we LOVED this one.  We don't have a grill so I used the broiler.  Also, we used gorganzola instead of what was called for in the recipe, only because we love it.  My husband didn't even realize there was no meat until I said something.  This is a keeper for sure!

These are amazing.  I like to add some balsamic vinegar to the olive oil to add a little more flavor.  We sometimes have them with a little sliced steak in them for those who can't give up their meat.

My family decided to have a sandwich night for dinner and I wanted something out of the ordinary. This sandwich was amazing!! I couldnt find foccacia bread at the store, so I used ciabatta bread and I loved how it worked with this sandwich! I roasted everything on a foil-lined pan and drizzled the veggies with olive oil, and threw the bread in there as well to get warm. I didnt have a red pepper, so I used a yellow one instead. I will DEFINITELY make this sandwich again!!

Great! Sauce was very flavorful and made the perfect amount. Turn the grill down for the bread (I burned mine). Next time I will use more feta or even a different type of cheese. Served with a red pepper salad.

Loved this sandwich.  It is now a staple in our house.  We always use roasted red pepper but often use whatever veggies we have.

This was absolutely delicious. Prepare the mayo mixture ahead of time so the flavors have time to develop. Instead of using Focaccia bread as it isn't easy to find, we used a Ciabatta roll. It worked perfectly. I also found garlic flavored feta cheese which added to the flavor. Enjoy! It will be on your favorites list too.

I wish I could give this more stars.  This is FANTASTIC!  I added some fresh basil leaves to the mayonnaise sauce (about 6 or so) and gave it a whirl in the food processor.  I also oven roasted my veggies and added some baby bella mushrooms to the mix.  I thinly pounded some chicken breast, sliced it, and drizzled that with the remaining lemon juice, EVOO, cajun and adobe seasoning and sauteed that as well, adding it to the finished sandwich. (Chicken was not necessary, but yummy as well!  I did not have feta so I used pepper jack cheese)  I served mine open faced on foccaccia bread...this will be a repeat meal.  Thanks for posting!!!

With all the amazing reviews this recipe gets, I HAD to try it! And it did not disappoint! I didn't use the grill, but simply sauteed the vegetables on the stove in olive oil. I also left off the onions, but I did everything else as written. Very, very good and filling too!

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I forgot the mayo dressing combo and just put mayo on the sandwhich itself. I used eggplant, squash, zucchini, red pepper and red onion. I grilled them on the George Foreman with a spray of olive oil and a spray of balsamic vinegar. I didn't have feta so I used goat cheese instead. One of my top favorite meals ever!

The most delicious thing ever!  Used whole grain pita bread in place of focaccia, and added raw spinach.  Replaced mayonnaise with olive oil & balsamic vineagar.  Seriously, this is to die for.

If you don't like feta cheese, try it with goat cheese.  I don't mind feta but goat cheese gives it a nice creamy earthy taste.  Sooo much better.

Amazing! If you are a person who doesn't like strong tastes or have a sensitive stomach (like me), I recommend using less onions and more squash. Next time I will add portabello mushrooms for something different.

This was awesome!! I made as written. For the main protein of the sandwich, I grilled a portabello mushroom for myself and a chicken breast for my husband. I used a ciabatta roll that I put in the oven to broil as it was getting too dark to do on the grill. Check out the recipe for Tuscan Soup on this website...it goes very well w/these sandwiches.

I never thought of grilling veggies to put on a sandwich, but seeing as this is one of the highest rated recipes on the site, I HAD to try it.  I sauteed garlic, red bell pepper, red onion, yellow squash, and a little avocado on a skillet for about 10 min on low until everything was soft and the garlic and onion were caramelized.  Toasted a roll with mayo and feta.  And then I devoured it, SO DELICIOUS!  Even my boyfriend, who basically hates veggies (esp. onion) tried a bite and had to admit it was F***ing delicious! So for one night a week where you dont want to eat meat, even for non veggies lovers, this is gold.  Thank you for the amazing idea.

I always add mushrooms when making this recipe.  I also add pesto and mustard to the sauce. It is a delicious, fabulous sandwich which I love. It is something that my meat eating self and veggie girlfriend can share together.

EXCELLENT! The dressing was fabulous and so tasty, I didn't have time to make fococcia bread so I used soft tortilla shells and heated them slightly in a frying pan with a little olive oil. They were great, my family loved them. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is a very good sandwich. Per a very rainy day, we had to roast the veges in the oven at 400.  We did not have a red bell but used the green one we had on hand with great results and added some sliced portabellas which we roasted along with all the other veges. As only feeding 2, used one focaccia, but did not cut the mayo mix - thank goodness, as it was barely enough for a light coating on the 2 halves.  After putting all veges and the cheese on the bread halves, wrapped in foil, placed cast iron pot on top and placed in oven at 400 to cook like an oven baked panini.  We could not eat the whole thing - even cutting in half, it was enough for four.  Thanks for sharing this easy, yummy recipe.

This sandwich is great for dinner or lunch.  I add sliced avocados to this and use ciabatta instead of focaccia.  They are easier to eat if you make them open faced, plus you can stack more veggies on it that way.

This was just awesome.  I made a few variations. The main one being that instead of using olive oil I did a combo of balsamic vinegar mixed with brown sugar and brushed on top of the veggies to give it more of a zesty taste.  I also used the broiler on the oven instead of the grill, and I added mushrooms to the mix.  This is definitely a restaurant quality sandwich and we'll be making it again for sure!

A great hit whenever I make this, with many variations! One thing which gives a very different flavor is substituting lemon juice with a tangy pickle, cut into tiny pcs..  or chopped sundried tomatoes (marinated in herbs & olive oil)

I have found recipes on here that have rave reviews before & when I try them, I'm not that impressed. I kind of thought that was going to happen here, but this really is a fantastic recipe. I've had it 2 nites in a row. I used lower fat mayo & really didn't taste a difference since there's so much flavor already. I did add some sun dried tomatoes to my mayo mixture. Also, I don't care for feta so I used marinated mozerella that I got from Trader Joe's which made it really special. We tried regualar mozz & it just wasn't as good. I also grilled some asparagus since I'm a big fan to add to the sandwich. Can't wait to have it again!

Absolutely Delicious!!! I had to make just a few changes...didn't have any lemon juice, so I substituted red wine vinegar. Served it on a red pepper panini bun. Yummy:)Thanks for sharing.

Yum! My meat and potato hubbie ate his and 1/2 of my son's. Even my 7 yr old loved it, it was just too much. All on a stove top grill pan, I grilled the squashes, red onion, red pepper and lightly warmed tomato since they tend to  fall apart with too much grilling. Next time I will lightly toast the focaccia before putting on the spread although my hubs loved it as is. Don't skimp on the feta, it makes every bite better! So so good.

Oh wow!!! This was AMAZING! I love food that makes my mouth happy! I don't even know where to start! The veggies and caramelized onions, with the warm crunchy grilled bread , and the tangy aioli and feta. The flavors melded together beautifully! Definitely a new favorite. It was also very easy to prepare! Loved it!

Vary good sammie! My husband likes meat so I added a sliced up grilled chicken breast. He's not a big squash fan so I subbed yellow squash for portobello mushrooms. I roasted everything in the oven instead of grilling and it turned out great. Also, because I'm not a huge feta fan I used Havarti instead. All substitutions worked and it seems to be a vary versitile sammie.

I love meat.
I'd give it up if all veggie recipes tasted like this.
Make this. Eat it. Love it.

Easily one of the best recipes you will find anywhere, not just on allrecipes.com.

I've started baking the veggies in the oven on days when I don't have a grill, which happens to be everyday since I live in an apartment.
It's still great baked!
The bread is key by the way.  Use focaccia.

Excellent recipe! I did the tin tray trick like others suggested, and drizzled a mixture of olive oil and balsamic vinegar over the bread as well. (I also skipped the cheese altogether, mostly because i'm not a fan of feta.) I'm dreaming of repeating last night's dinner right now!

Awesome.  Use feta cheese... I also used a slice of provolone.  I didn't grill these either!  I first cooked the veggies all together on the stove then popped the whole thing into the oven to melt the cheese & sort of toast the bread.  I added portabello mushrooms, tomatoes, and asparagus as well.  The only downide is the prep of all those vegetables.

Exceptional! My boyfriend and I don't have a grill, so we made this by sauteing the veggies over the stove on a non-stick frying pan.  Very quick, easy to do. A good way to get in your veggies for the day.

Don't ask me how a vegetarian from California ended up in Utah living with a carnivorous husband and sons, or how when they turned on food network as I was making this recipe and the show was about hamburgers -- but it happened.  AND they ate this all and fast!  It is so good!  I pretty much followed the recipe, coating the veggies with a bit of balsamic dressing before grilling on my Cuisinart Griddler Gourmet (grill plates, closed).   I used inexpensive Asiago Demi Bread from the bakery at Super Target.  I Will definitely make this again, and again and I bet the resident meat eaters will finish it every time.

LOVED IT! I sliced and tossed all the veggies in a bowl with a bit of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. BBQ'd all together in a BBQ grill pan. Any seasonal veggies would work (mushrooms, asparagus, etc.) I plan on serving this to my vegetarian friends next weekend for lunch.

this is one of my husband and I favorite!  If you haven't tried you are missing out!  I use one clove of garlic and cheesy rolls.  My husband is a meat man and he just loves this sandwich.  Don't miss the meat at all!! Portabella  mushrooms are great too.

This sandwich is really delicious and very filling!  As suggested in some other reviews, we added portabella mushrooms and cooked all the vegetables in a grill basket. We cooked them far longer than the recommended time.

This recipe was great and needed no changes to the ingredients or preparation.  I would recommend this sandwich to both vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.  I will make this recipe all summer long.  It makes me feel like I'm running my own sandwich business out of my kitchen because it takes like something you'd get from a great restaurant.  Well done!

This is definitely a 5 star sandwich! It is a super-popular, super-easy crowd pleaser for casual entertaining. We get the veggies and mayo ready ahead of time, then throw it together just before company arrives and serve w/salad and sweet potato fries. It's a good base recipe for endless combos of veggies, cheese, spread, and bread--though it's hard to beat the combo here. Thanks!

I'm always looking for vegetarian sandwiches that I can make for lunch that will last in a cooler. I pre-made enough veggies to keep in the fridge for dinner and lunches. This was excellent the following day. Great on sourdough as well.

If I could give this 10 stars I would.  This is quite possibly the best recipe I have ever made from this site.    I used grilled eggplant, zucchini, and red & yellow peppers and soaked them in a balsamic vinaigrette for about an hour.  My husband loved it too!

It was delicious and filling!I made a couple minor changes-  I added sun dried tomato pesto to the mayonaise spread because I had it on hand, it adds some complexity to the sauce and tastes great mixed with the lemon. (about 1 heaping tablespoon)  After I chopped up the veggies I added a splash of  balsalmic vinegar and pepper, and then refrigerated for an hour. I used french rolls because I couldn't find focaccia bread- they were still delicious.  Also, I don't have a grill so I just cooked the veggies at 350 for 15 minutes, then broiled for the last 5 minutes with the bread and cheese also, which gave it a great crunch. Yum.   I didn't add any additional veggies (some add potobella mushrooms but I don't care for them) but I wish I had grilled more because this is a great dish and could eat it over and over again. You seriously won't miss the meat, and it gives you a great 'full' feeling without any heavyness.

Delicious!  I used ciabatta because focacia wasn't available at my store that day.  Wonderful alternative, although I think the focacia might be even more delicious.  Added one portobello mushroom too.  Next time I may try a few suggestions, including marinating the veggies briefly and pop wrapping the assembled sandwiches in foil and placing them in the oven or back on the grill under a brick for a few minutes before serving.

YUMMMM..didn't grill this (I ended up roasting my veggies in the oven with some EVOO), but it still tasted awesome! I used hearty artisan bread (in individual portions) for the sandwiches and canola mayo as part of the spread. VERY filling and scrumptious...my meat-loving BF even commented on how good they were...next time, I'll definitely try fixing them on the grill!

Oh, yes! This was fabulous! My teen daughter is a die-hard vegetarian and I'm a semi-veggie so we're always looking for something new and tasty. This recipe did not disappoint. I used the Foreman Grill and splashed some raspberry vinagrette on the veggies in addition to a swipe of olive oil. It took about 15 minutes for the veggies to get crisp/soft. My garlic was dry & husk-ey, so I used garlic powder and subbed light mayo. Tasted great anyway! I also used way more veggies than the recipe called for including some small portabello mushrooms. Instead of Focaccia bread, I used french bread. I also used a slice of 2% swiss which was yummy. After I made the sandwiches, I threw some frozen chicken tenders on for my son and served it on a toasted bun along with the rest of the mayo dressing - he announced it was "fantastic". I will be making this again, but I will use some sort of whole-grain bread to add fiber and cut calories.

Delicious!  We didn't have focaccia bread so just used our whole wheat bread in the house.  It was kind of flimsy, but still tasted terrific.  I think some mushrooms added to the mix would be great too!

LOVED IT!  I didn't change a thing abotu the recipe.  I did add Avacado slices which ended up being a nice addition to an already great recipe.  NOTE;  Not all foccacia is equal.  If you can get some good freshly made - I used a spinach florentine loaf from my local bakery - good stuff!  Makes 4 decent size sandwiches.

excellent! we're always grilling veggies but never thought to put them in a sandwich and the sauce and feta was really a great combo! this would work nicely as a wrap too (save some calories) but the focaccia bread was very tasty!

Delicious!!!  We made this while it was still too cool out to grill so we spread the veggies out on a cookie sheet and baked them at 350 for about 15 minutes and then slid the bread in (with the mayo and feta on it) and cranked it up to broil for the last 10 or so minutes.  The veggies were perfectly tender and slightly golden and the cheese was soft and the bread toasty.   We used a hearty cracked wheat bread (heidelberg brand) and it was perfect!  I also replaced the fresh garlic with the jarred variety and used extra yellow squash because we didn't have any zucchini.  Finally, we replaced the red pepper with a green one and it was just as tasty!!  Highly recommended - a great way to spice up your veggies!

I made this for vegetarian house guests and it was fantastic. Even my meat-loving husband enjoyed it. Will definitely make this again. Next time, I'll probably try adding some pesto to the sauce to give it a bit more flavor.

The mayo, grilled veggies, and feta are really great on good bread.  I used mushrooms and yellow onion, zucchini, and green peppers (what I had on hand) and I broiled them in the oven (dead of winter here).  I also melted a slice of swiss cheese over the top of each one.  Fantastic flavor.

HANDS DOWN my FAVORITE sandwich!  There are so many different varieties of this resipe you can do.  I like to add some grilled chicken and also carve out some of the inside of the loaf of bread so all the fillings of the sandwich stay put! SO GOOD!

This recipe is fantastic.  The melted feta and focaccia bread together are wonderful, and I have yet to find a better use for squash.  I've made this recipe half-a-dozen times now, and it's been delicious every time.

This was awesome!  I made it a little different though.
I used Tomato/Basil Foccacia--which was great!
I grilled zucchini and squash, portobello mushrooms and red onions on the George Foreman.  I had sauteed the mushrooms in Balsamic Vinaigrette dressing first.
I put Feta Cheese on the bread and under the broiler for a few minutes.
After the cheese melted a little bit, I added the above cooked veggies along with fresh spinach and sliced tomato!  I did use the mayo/garlic/lemon juice mix and it was seriously awesome

I made these sandwiches for lunch today and they were so good! I used a grill pan on my stovetop instead of grilling outdoors and it turned out fine -- just took a little more time! Will definitely make again!

EXCELLENT!!! Made for a quick lunch on our panini press last Saturday when I had company and everyone raved about them. Will make again this summer and try all different veggies.

Being vegetarian I replaced the mayo with grapeseed mayo (no eggs) for this delicious sauce.  I made this for all of my guests this past summer, everyone raved about it, no complaints about my vegetarian lifestyle!  The best thing is that it tastes even better the next day, if there'e any leftoversI double the sauce recipe because it's so good, it could be a dipping sauce all by itself. This is a keeper

This recipe is AMAZING, very delicious.  I made this for dinner for several non-vegetarians and they all commented on how tasty the sandwiches were.  The aioli is so flavorful, that I will likely use it on most sandwiches I make in the future.  Thank you for the great recipe!  I love it and will definitely regularly make it.

I don't recommend using garlic.  We used lemon juice instead.  Also, make sure to get the regular cream cheese, not the whipped...the consistency is much better!

I love all the different flavors of this sandwich. The lemon-mayo was amazing. I plan on making this often.

The sauce on this was soooo good.  I give the sauce 5 stars. I liked the veggies too. I would definately not like this as much if I just saute'd the veggies...grilling was the key.  But, next time I will try some chicken breast...just a thinly sliced chicken breast, with the veggies.

Very delicious. I swapped the red pepper for eggplant and grilled everything on my stove top grill. I also used a sprouted barley bread. Together with a bowl of chicken vegetable soup, it was a perfect cold weather meal.

First real meal I've had since deciding to try out a vegetarian lifestyle, and it was a great introduction. Very tasty, highly recommended.

It was good, but seemed to be kind of lacking in taste. i dont like feta, so i used a slice of swiss cheese. it might need some salt next time.
