Perfect - I was looking for a simple tofu marinade and this worked just great.  Plus, I had never baked tofu in the oven before and I loved it - I think I will always cook it this way!  Thank you so much this was great.  I had to make some changes b/c I didn't have all the ingredients and I added some veggies - but I will definitely try this one as is when I get more honey - Yum!

The tofu absorbed too much marinade and it was very salty.  Our family prefers a crispier tofu and this was quite soggy after being baked.  Not what we were looking for.

mmm this was so good! i only let mine marinate for a few minutes because of time, and i only drizzled about one spoonful of remaining marinade into the rice. the honey balances it out perfectly. i also used brown rice instead of basmati and added brussels sprouts.

I use low-sodium soy sauce or you can dilute the soy with water - half and half ratio as one other reviewer suggested.  If you don't like the 'mushy' texture, this can be remedied by sliding it under the broiler for just a few minutes.  Great, simple, tasty recipe that can be jazzed up by adding extra veggies or even seafood or meat of choice if you don't want a vegan version.  Thanks for the recipe!

Definitely freeze the tofu and thaw before cooking this. Also, be sure to pat/squeeze the excess fluid out of the tofu before cooking. Otherwise it's a lot like eating a warm, wet sponge!

I would have to agree with Jessica - the tofu did turn out very mushy.  Doubling the marinade and only marinating the tofu for an hour or so may have done the trick.  Personally, I wasn't too thrilled with the overall flavor.  I thought it turned out a bit boring and not tasty at all. Won't be making this again.

I really liked this recipe.  I used half the soy sauce and replaced it with water.  Also, I drizzled it with agave nectar.  I usually prefer the nectar over honey.

Very good!  I used a little more honey and I would recommend doubling the sauce.

This is pretty good.  The flavor of the tofu is very strong and that makes it work in a wide variety of meals.

I made this with Asparagus & Cashews from this site... it was tasty, though pretty salty (despite using low-sodium soy sauce). I would probably make it again.

Delicious flavor!  I didn't marinade it, just eye-balled the ingredients and baked it for 10 min. @ 425.  Served it with stir fried veggies & rice.  Topped it with sweet chilli sauce.  Will definitely make it again.  I may even plan to marinade overnight!

I liked this very much and my husband liked it even more.  I made a mistake though of not making sure all the slices of tofu are completely submerged in the marinade.  The slices that were submerged all the way tasted so much better than the slices that had only some of the marinade on it.  So I think I will quadruple this recipe next time.

used all ingredients organic.  substituted low sodium organic tamari sauce for soy sauce.  marinated 1 hour, turning tofu slices over every 15 min for even coverage. add veggie of choice to baking sheet and baked with the tofu.  1/2 the rice for fewer carbs. substituted agave nectar for honey as previously suggested.  this came out restaurant quality! light, yet full of flavor!  thank you for the recipe   :)

This tofu seemed extra mushy and I'm not a fan of that so for personal reasons, only 3 stars.  Otherwise, good flavor.

My hubby and I really enjoyed this dish fresh out of the oven! We are new to cooking tofu, but we meal prep each week, so we made a large portion of the tofu and placed it in several glass dishes. I will say the longer it sits in your fridge, the worse it gets. It becomes soggy & tasteless. 
???Best advice: only make what you will eat for dinner. This is VERY tasty & very healthy.

I was looking for a simple way to cook some firm tofu and this met the requirements. I decided to pan fry the tofu thinking I would get a harder skin on the fried side of tofu. It was good however it must be the texture of tofu that makes it difficult to say it was great.

i liked this. I used about half of the soy sauce with water. The seasame seeds are key - they add a delicious texture! I used black sesame seeds.
