Pretty good! I used brown sugar, mini marshmallows, an extra 1/2 oz of espresso and it was still delicious. I will definitely be making this again. Make sure to add in the espresso last. If you let it sit when it comes out of the machine, it will burn and taste gross after 10 seconds.

This is amazing! I didn't have marshmallow topping, so I melted some and mixed in in, perfect.

To make the best latte have your milk steamed and ready to go while you brew your espresso so you can quiskly assemble the drink. If you prefer, you can mix the marshmallow, sugar, and cocoa powder together with the steamed milk then pour the brewed espresso in last.
