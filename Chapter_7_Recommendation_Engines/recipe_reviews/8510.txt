I've been looking for a recipe similar to the one served in the cafeteria at my college. This came pretty close. I did change a few things--- I added red bell pepper and used crushed potato chips for the topping. I think the recipe calls for too many almonds, so I will be changing it the next time. My boyfriend, who normally doesn't like this sort of thing, thought it was good on bread.

This was really good, but it had a little too many almonds and a little too much celery for my taste.

I did my own creativity by putting in some chopped onion, water chestnuts and some salt and pepper....I thought the recipe was a good base to start with and then take it to the next level.

I used a little less celery and lemon than the recipe called for. It was great.

Excellent! I followed the recipe to the T and it was perfect. The celery is a must have. And it stays crispy! It's even good cold! A keeper for sure!

Not good. It's not that tasty to have so much WARM mayo AND lemon juice. Too tangy. If you can cut it with biscuits or potatoe, you can finish your plate.

No almonds, added bacon bits, 2 chopped hard boiled eggs, homemade mayo,  and ranch dressing mix. Excellent.

Mine was very dry and it needed something for extra flavor.
