The only change I made was to bake the brownies in a 15" x 10" pan. I used heart-shaped cookie cutters and covered them with the ganache. After the chocolate was solid, I used white chocolate to make strips across the hearts. They were a great hit at my Valentine party!

This was not all that great.  A lot of work, and even with adding whipped cream and raspberry sauce, it was just average.

I found the brownie cakes to be a bit dry when I made them. The chocolate on top of the cakes made it a bit too sweet. I would recommend maybe putting a few tablespoons of milk or less flour in the recipe. For the chocolate, I would next time use maybe dark chocolate chips instead of semi sweet.
