The chard made a beautiful presentation, and the pine nuts and raisins were a surprise, delicious addition.  Definitely a keeper.

An excellent and easy side dish. Can also accompany chicken, pork or be served with poached or fried eggs. The contrast of the sweet raisins and pine nuts with the chard (or spinach) is really delicious.

This was very delicious! The texture was terrific and had just the right amount of sweetness. I substituted chopped pecans in this dish only because I didn't have pine nuts on hand. But I'm sure the pine nuts are really good too!

Almost too sweet unless paired with something salty (grilled fish).

I used my homemade, oven dried raisins. It was amazing! Great recipe!

Serve it with garlic cheese grits and all you need is an entree.

This was a delicious addition to an all-vegetarian Spanish dinner, alongside yellow rice, black beans, and plantains. I followed the recipe as is and didn't make any additions. It was excellent!

I followed this recipe exactly - no changes, and it was perfect! Swiss chard is one of the simanim that my husband's family uses for Rosh Hashanah. It was my first year making it, and it was a huge success. The raisins add such a balanced sweetness to the nutty flavor, which couldn't be better for celebrating the Jewish New Year. My husband's sephardic family gobbled it all up the first night, and they were mightily impressed by this ashkenazi bride. Thanks for posting this. I plan to make it every year!

I used cashews instead of pine nuts (what I had on hand). Delish.

Yum, I had this as my dinner.  Didn't have raisins or oil, but used butter and craisins which were perfect.  Good recipe.
