My husband is vegan and I make him hot chocolate and just usually substitute soy or rice milk for "regular" milk but I decided to try this as we love coconut milk recipes.  We both LOVED it!  Not too sweet but sweet enough, same for the chocolatyness.  I just ran out of regular cocoa so I used Hershey's Special Dark instead.  It turned out lovely!  Thanks for sharing a delicious Vegan version of hot cocoa!!  :)

It definitely didn't taste exactly like real hot cocoa, nor was it very creamy, but I have to say it was tasty nonetheless. I might substitute the water for some soy milk or add more coconut milk next time.

I am not vegan; I had leftover coconut milk from another recipe and stumbled across this one looking for ways to use it up.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  I found it rather sweet-- likely I could have doubled the water and made it into two servings.  It's got quite a high fat and sugar content (although probably comparable to regular hot chocolate) so it is definitely a beverage to drink as an occasional treat.  Aside from the too-sweetness I liked the flavour; I will probably make this again.

This turned out great. I did make a few modifications (as any good chef might). Added cayenne pepper into the mix (to taste) and sea salt. I did not use as much sugar as the recipe called for, maybe 2 tbsp.   I enjoy my hot cocoa spicy and a little salty, the sugar just helps to round out the other two flavors.  thanks for posting the recipe. never thought of using coconut milk and it it's a great alternative for those of us trying to steer clear of dairy.

I found a can of coconut milk in my pantry and went searching for a recipe this morning and came up with this one. I made four servings of this recipe. I didn't make mine in the mug, I actually made it on the stovetop. This came together nicely and made a tasty cocoa. Next time, I'd definetely increase the cocoa amount and use milk in place of the water for a creamier cocoa.

Like a mounds bar in a cup!  If I could give this more stars I would!  I'm not a vegan, but was looking for something that I could have in my lower carb and sugar plan. This is perfect!  It's rich and creamy and a perfect blend of flavors.  I substituted Truvia for the sugar (I used 2 pkts.) and just a dash of sea salt to enhance the flavor, but other than that followed the recipe.  I can actually have a couple of cups of this a day without feeling guilty!

This was pretty good - I reduced the sugar by half and used light coconut milk.  The result was tasty but seemed a little watered down - maybe a regular coconut milk would have helped make it "creamier".  I know I'll make this again, but would probably use soy milk instead of water (or even regular milk, since we are not vegan), but I must say the subtle coconut, vanilla and cinnamon flavors work very well!

Very delicious and it's a convenient recipe to have for the times I'm out of non-dairy milks. I added a little cinnamon schnapps for a kick. I will make this again but when I have non-dairy milk around, I will use it instead of water for the extra vitamins. Thanks!

It smelled fantastic, but the taste was just okay. I may try again and play with the ingredient amounts - less cinnamon and sugar, and more coconut milk next time. It has potential.

As a person who cannot have dairy, this was quite a find.....and a delicious one at that! The combination of the vanilla and coconut is a perfect blend. Slighty sweet, but a great twist on traditional hot chocolate!

Thank you Thank you Thank you!!! I have been dying for some good hot cocoa that is dairy free. The mixes that I found at the specialty stores just didn't come close to the regular dairy cocoa. But this was Heaven in a cup for me :) It's freezing cold outside and it's so nice to finally be able to sit down with some good hot cocoa!!! I didn't have any canned coconut milk on hand but I did have the So Delicious Coconut milk and it was still super yummy!

I REALLY wanted some hot cocoa and I didn't have any instant and I came across this recipe.  I did not have any coconut milk so I used skim milk instead.  I added everything else according to the recipe, except I added 2 1/2 tablespoons of sugar.  I have to say...I absolutely loved it.  Easy to make and very creamy!  Perfect hot cocoa!  Thanks for sharing!

First of all...LOVED IT!!!!!!! But I am not a vegan nor lactose intolerant so I did substitute evaporated milk for the water. Like someone else said, it's not terribly cocoa-y but still is wonderful and yummy:)

I used the original recipe as a starting point, i.e., coconut milk. Used leftover 7 oz organic coconut milk (from a can) and mixed in 2 cups regular Silk soy milk, 2 1/2 tablespoons Navitas cacao powder, 4 packets Sugar in the Raw turbinado sugar, 2 dashes cinnamon and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. It was delish! My husband is still talking about it an hour later.

This hot cocoa had a very smooth flavor which I enjoyed!  It was sugary, but no more than other recipes I've tried. I'll make it again.

Great idea. I thought about this after reading up on the Primal Blueprint, glad I found the recipe! I'm off dairy and used it with Starbuck's mocha powder I had. I just used it and the water and c. milk. Tasted great, just a little different consistency...

Excellent treat!  I subbed 1 tbsp agave nectar for the sugar and topped my cup with SO Delicious brand coconut whip.  it was perfect for me but my teenage son wanted more agave.

Very nice. Tastes way better than store bought. 
I used brown sugar instead of white. 
I also made a cup with no sugar at all, on request.  I added an extra table spoon of coconut milk to help balance out the bitter cocoa. 

This recipe could definitely pass in an expensive cafe.

Found this too watery.  Much better with 2/3 cup coconut milk and 1/3 cup boiling water.  Liked the vanilla/cinnamon flavorings.

I had a little leftover coconut cream and found this recipe on the search button. This is definitely not creamy! I actually thought it was very watery and I only added 1/2 the water suggested. Only subtitute I made was using a packet of Truvia for the sugar. I can't imagine the regular sugar would have changed the consistency that much. I suppose, this would be fine if one couldn't have milk, but it's still mediocre tasting. The calories are super high too, even with using a sugar subtitute.

Although this recipe does not taste exactly like the hot chocolate most of us are used to, it is so good!  I'm trying to stay off milk products because they give me eczema.  It is blizzarding out today and I really wanted some hot cocoa.  This did the trick!

Note, I substituted nutmeg for cinnamon, and maple syrup for sugar.
