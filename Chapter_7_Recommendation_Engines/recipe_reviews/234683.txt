Holy COW!!!!  These were fantastic.  I appreciated the video to help me learn how to twist these.  You're right, Chef John, they don't suck. :)

I made this today, the results were great.  However, my sticks were very different.  I measured out 1/4 cup of grated cheese which is 2 oz.
I had WAY more cheese than the video showed, and there was no way I could have rolled them that way.  I had to roll them with the cheese INSIDE instead of outside, which was challenging.  However, they turned out just great!!  The insides are very cheesy, and the outsides have some nice crunchy cheese all up and down them.

Delicious and super easy.  You can make them in advance and pop them in the oven just before your guests arrive.

Super easy, but be careful as they disappear very fast.  My first batch was gone before I could even start on the second.

These were good but I think for ease and to have the cheese not fall off, next time I will make them into a roll and slice for pinwheels and maybe add some prosciutto or ham (leave out the salt, they were too salty for my taste also the oil is not necessary). Thanks for sharing!

These are SO fast, SO easy, SO delishíous and impressive!  I think a strong flavored cheese would be nice, and experiment with seasoning with  garlic powder or herbs. Makes 9 sticks and most people will eat at least 2.

These are amazing!  Now, they puff up about 4 times the dough size, which I sort of saw in pix. So first I cut each third of a sheet into 5 pieces, but still bigger than I wanted. Next sheets I cut into 6 each and they are more breadstick-like. After first flip while baking, watch carefully as they can burn easily.  It’s a little work to make these, but  definitely worth it.

The puff pastry sheet that I had did not unfold.  I ended up just rolling it out with a rolling pin and carrying on.  They are delicious

the cheddar all stuck to the plastic wrap
not good
i
 i didnt give up i followed another pastry chefs method
and covered 1/2 with cheese folded it over and rolled
it to original size
the one thing i forgot to do was because there was no
cheese on the outside give an egg or oil wash on oneside before twisting otherwise great

thanks for the demo 2 more stars

I got scared that they would not be crisp enough, and left in the oven for another few minutes.  Will not do again, as it made them a little too dry.  Nevertheless, our guests loved them, and so did we.  Will definitely make again!  My husband dipped them in butter while eating!

I made these yesterday and was a little disappointed.   I think (and mind, I said "think") it may have been my oven because after the first 10 minutes and when I flipped the sticks they were already starting to burn.  I hate to blame it on my oven because just prior,  for another puff pastry twist recipe, I had to bake them an additional 4 minutes.  Perhaps if these were cooked at a lower than 425 degrees they would have turned out better.  I had to throw out half of the twists.   However, the flavor was terrific.  Debbie

These are awesome, but I followed the recipe except for I used Pillsbury crescent rolls and followed the direction up and until the twisting, I wanted the crescents for a side for gnocchi and sausage dinner. An excellent choice. Thank you
