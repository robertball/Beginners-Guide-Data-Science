My kids like this made into stuffed french toast. Just make the sandwich as usual, and dip into your french toast batter. They always ask for seconds.

Ive been making this type of sandwich for years. I just slather some Crountry Crock Churn-Style Spread on a slice of bread, (white, wheat, oat bran, whatever I have on hand) then spread on some peanut butter, and drizzle on desired amount of honey, and top with other slice of bread. Mmm... yum, I love this kind of sandwich!!  I hope others will give this sandwich a try, as it's that good!!  Thanx for posting the recipe Tracy.

Great recipe! ..I'm not a fan of peanut butter sandwiches..not that I hate peanut butter, love it...just not as a sandwich ingredient.. but I actually finished the whole sandwich! The  honey added extra flavor!  ( I used 4 slices of bread to make 2 sandwiches...to lessen the calories)

If you leave your sandwich open long enough for the honey to soak into the bread, then close it up; it's even better. I've been making these since I was a kid (now in my 40's).  Also very good with thinly sliced banana on it.

Lovin' it! :) thanx...super simple and totally perfect...who DOESN'T always have peanutbutter and honey and bread on hand? Plus it's tasty. Try adding thinly sliced apples, bananas, or almonds. Mix it up...but no matter what you do it will be tasty!! :D       ~Katie =]

This is pretty yummy. I like the consistency the butter and honey gives to the peanut butter. I used Skippy creamy natural and it made it even more creamy and a nice spreading consistency. I actually did like it better plain though, then on the bread. I bet it would be good on crackers or something similar.

Really good. I like to toast mine. I usually omit the butter because A: I'm lazy and B: It's even more fattening but soooo good with the butter (or even the tub margarine stuff).

We're talking comfort food here. This is how my mother (raised in Upstate NY) used to make peanut butter sandwiches for us kids when we were little. She always felt that peanut butter by itself was too thick. Have you ever had peanut butter tear your bread, or just gum up in your mouth?  She would cream all the ingredients together like the recipe instructs, and then spread it on the bread. Thanks for sharing - it brought back memories!!

When I broke up with my boyfriend, he used to make these sandwiches for me to take to work as part of his wooing-back method.  I guess they worked..I loved the taste -somehow comforting and sweet- and we're still together, lol!!

My 3 year-old is not a big fan of PBJ, but she liked this a lot. I'll be making it again. I've had peanut butter and honey sandwiches before where you spread one on one side and one on the other, but this was better. Mixing the honey in and adding the butter makes it so nice and smooth. Thanks for the great idea.

Soo good! But I didn't add the butter because it does not need any extra butter. I'm normally a PB with banana person but this was good! Sometimes I sub the honey for agave nectar and its awesome!
