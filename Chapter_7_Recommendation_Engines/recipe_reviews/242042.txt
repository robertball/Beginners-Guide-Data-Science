I would never have thought in a million years I could pass this off on Hubs.  He dislikes so many cheeses, Boursin being one of them.  He never said a word as he was eating them and, when asked, admitted he liked the potatoes and didn’t even know the Boursin was in there.  It then begs the question, “So why include the Boursin if you can’t taste it anyway?”  Trust me, you can taste the Boursin.  And it’s good.  So Hubs just THINKS he doesn’t like Boursin.  I prepared this as written but did not precisely measure any of the ingredients, particularly the amount of buttermilk.  I really doubt I used as much as called for.  As this recipe’s first reviewer I regret having to say I didn’t get an immediate “yum” factor with these.  I missed the creaminess and richness that butter provides.  So I added the butter and…yum.

I cooked 5 lbs of potatoes and if I had used the full quart of buttermilk the recipe called for they would’ve been incredibly thin. Next time I’ll skip the buttermilk entirely and add melted butter for richness. Also, I had to salt & pepper these a whole lot because they were bland in spite of the Boursin. In the end the potatoes did taste good.

This was my 3rd time making this and since it had been a while since I last made it, I couldn't remember whether or not I put milk in it. So this time I did. As a result, the texture was a little off; I like my mashed potatoes thick. Next time I make it, I'll be sure to skip the milk. But as far as taste is concerned, it was full of flavor.
