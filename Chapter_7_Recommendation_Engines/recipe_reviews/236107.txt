This recipe is OK. It's missing something. I followed the recipe for the marinade exactly and found the honey dominated the flavors. I would decrease the honey to 1-2 Tablespoons if I make it again. Also, the recipe didn't say how to handle the basil so I put all the ingredients in the food processor and mixed until well blended. I had to look this up--->one lemon juiced = 3 Tablespoons.

It was okay. I'm not sure of the balance of seasoning. It was very lemony and overpowered the salmon.  I also found that by the recipe measurements, there was not really enough to marinade for the suggested  amount of salmon. If you are going to try it,  I suggest you double it.

I donâ€™t care for salmon and made this for my husband who loves salmon, so this is his rating of  a 3.  He complained the marinade overpowered the salmon, however the salmon was very moist.  I marinated it for one and a half hours, so less time marinating might have worked for him.
