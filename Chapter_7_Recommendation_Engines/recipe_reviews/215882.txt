I picked this recipe to try because I love zucchini.  Unfortunately, my daughter doesn't like zucchini but that was her only complaint.  She did take two servings though.  Hubby's opinion was it wasn't cheesy enough.  I did only use half the Romano but I did use an extra 1/2 cup of mozzarella.  I also left the basil leaves out.  I thought it was pretty good.

Turned out pretty good.  Made two 8x8 Lasagnas and froze one.
